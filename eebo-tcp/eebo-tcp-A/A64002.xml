            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And of this unjuſt partiality, no profeſſion hath taſted in a greater meaſure, than that of Divinity; for of our Miniſters, ſuch whom God hath beſt fitted with parts and Learning for the diſcuſſing of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, have been ſo undervalued in compariſon of ſome Forraine Divines, whoſe Learning was little better than ſyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall; as that they languiſhed in their private ſtudies, and had dyed in obſcurity, unleſſe the fame of their great abilities had been eccho'd over unto us by the generall applauſe of all Chriſtendome.

This, ſome (who talked their ſhares) interpreted as an Argument of the former weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or at leaſt preſent decay of his intellectualls. But as <note n="c" place="margin">Cicero de Senectute.</note> 
               <hi>Sophocles,</hi> when his Sonnes brought him into queſtion for Dotage, is reported to have recited a Tragedy of <hi>Oedipus Coloneus,</hi> which he had laſt written, and had in his Hands, and to have demanded whether that ſeemed the Verſe of a Dotard, or no. So our <hi>Doctor</hi> could have ſtop'd the Mouths of theſe bold cenſurers by Publiſhing very Maſculine and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous pieces that he Penned in even his moſt declining Age.

                              <p>WOrthy Sir, according to your deſire to take into Conſideration this writing directed unto you, at length I have gotten ſome leaſure from other imployments, to addreſſe my ſelfe to give you ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this particular.</p>
                              <p n="1">1 That I may ſhew my ſelfe anſwerable to that reſpect which you have deſerved at my hands; and not ſo only, but to my zeale of Gods truth, which hath deſerved much more at the hands of us both.</p>
                              <p n="2">2 That you may the better diſcern which of us two, whom you put to conferre, doth maintain the cauſe of Gods truth, and hath the beſt reaſons on his ſide.</p>
                              <p>As for the change of Opinion here mentioned, ſuch Profeſſions are nothing ſtrange. But whether ſuch a Profeſſion be in truth, or in pretence, and rather liberty taken to manifeſt that Opinion, which formerly hath been cheriſhed: as alſo with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience voyd of all carnall reſpects, ſuch a change or manifeſtation is made, it belongs not unto us to judge, but to leave that unto God, who tryeth the hearts and reynes. Sure we are, the heart of man is full of deceitfulneſſe, both to deceive others, yea and to deceive our ſelves, the more need there is to be jealous over our ſelves, and to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a watchfull eye over our own ſoules, and whether we have chang'd a former way, or at the firſt choſe one or other way, and continue to imbrace that, whereof we have been at firſt informed; not to deſpiſe, but in the feare of God, to practice that <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 5.</note> holy counſell of the Apoſtle given to the Corinthians, a famous Church, and ſuch as were deſtitute of no ſpirituall gift. Prove your ſelves, whether you are in the Faith, examine your ſelves: know ye not your own ſelves, that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye be Reprobates? as alſo to conſider how indifferently we carry our ſelves, in uſing means to inform our ſelves in the way of truth, and whether they be not ſuch as doe diſcover our chiefe care hath been to bring our judgements about, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 19. 2 Theſ. 2. 10, 11.</note> of that way (whether Truth or Errour) which formerly we did effect. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that Hereſies muſt be, and that to this end, that they that are approved may be made manifeſt. And Illuſions ſhall have their courſe, when the truth of God is not imbraced with love, whatſoever be the pretence of our diſaffecting it, whether harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to affections, or diſcrepancy to carnall reaſon. And when ſuch judgements have their courſe, Who are priviledged from being ſeduced? Let our Saviour ſpeake in this, <note place="margin">Matth. 24. 24.</note> So that if it were poſſible men ſhould deceive the very elect. Upon what may we be aſſured to ſtand firme in time of ſuch temptation? Let the Apoſtle anſwer us in this, <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 13.</note> when after the effectuall working of Satan in them that periſh, he comes neere to them to whom he writes in the way of comfort thus, But we ought to give thankes alway to God, for you Brethren beloved of the Lord, becauſe that God hath from the beginning choſen you unto ſalvation through ſanctification of the ſpirit and faith of the truth. Like as before he did conclude unto himſelfe their election, from obſervation of the work of their Faith, the labour of their Love, and the patience of their Hope. And the greater is the comfort which hereby is miniſtred unto us, the greater ſhould be our care, to informe our ſelves aright, in the doctrine thereof, and eſpecially to have an eye unto it, that we doe not ſhape it in ſuch a manner, that like as it is impoſſible we ſhould have any aſſurance thereof, ſo it will prove equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible we ſhould draw any comfort from thence.</p>

I had thought rather that the reſolution of the Point concerning Predeſtination, had depended upon the reſolution of the Point touching Grace efficacious, then the contrary. As namely, if Faith be confeſſed to be the gift of God, and that not with reſpect to any thing in man, it followeth herehence, that Predeſtination unto faith, and reprobation from

So then as ſoon as <hi>Auſtin</hi> came to acknowledg, that Faith it ſelfe was the gift of God, he therewithall came off from affirming, that <hi>Quem ſibi crediturum eſſe praeſcivit, ipſum elegit, cui Spiritum Sanctum daret ut bona operando etiam vitam aeternam conſequeretur.</hi> And like as before he maintained, that God elected ſome (to wit, Believers) to beſtow the Holy ſpirit upon them, that by working good workes, they might obtain alſo everlaſting life; ſo now having found that Faith alſo, is the gift of God, he was accordingly to maintain, that God elected ſome to beſtow the Holy ſpirit upon them, that both by believing, and working good workes, they might obtain everlaſting life: ſo that no longer was the foreſight of Faith, to precede election in <hi>Auſtins</hi> opinion, to wit, after once he knew Faith to be the gift of God.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Auſtin</hi> addreſſeth himſelfe in that diſcourſe of his, to prove that the very Initiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith, is the work of God, and not the Augmentation only. His words are theſe, <hi>Sed nunc iis reſpondendum eſſe video, qui divina teſtimonia, quae de hâc re adhibuïmus, ad hoc dicunt valere, ut noverimus ex nobis quidem nos habere ipſam fidem, ſed incrementum ejus ex Deo: tanquam fides non ab ipſo donetur nobis, ſed ab ipſo tantum augeatur in nobis ex merito quo coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit à nobis.</hi> And likewiſe in the 19. cap. of the ſame Book, having propounded the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Pelagians, namely that becauſe <hi>God foreſaw that we would be holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable before him in love, therefore he elected and predestinated us in Chriſt, before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World;</hi> and ſhew'd how this opinion, contradicts that of the Apoſtle <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4, 5. where it is ſaid, that, <hi>God elected us in Chriſt, and predeſtinated us before the foundation of the World, that we ſhould be holy and unblameable before him in love:</hi> and perceiving with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all how the <hi>Maſſilians</hi> did avoid this as nothing contrary to their Tenent (though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Pelagian Tenent) foraſmuch as they maintained not, that God foreſaw any thing but our Faith, and therefore God elected us before the foundation of the World, that we ſhould be holy and unblameable before him in love, (for theſe were their words) <hi>Nos autem dicimus nostram Deum non praeſciſſe niſi fidem &amp; ideo nos elegiſſe—ut etiam ſancti &amp; immaculati gratia atquè opere ejus eſſemus;</hi> what courſe doth <hi>Auſtin</hi> take to beat them off but this, namely to prove, that, Like as Holines ſo Faith alſo, and that as touching the Initiation thereof, is the work of God. thus: <hi>Sed audiant ipſi in hoc te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonio, ubi dicit, ſortem conſecuti ſimus, praedeſtinati ſecundum propoſitum qui univerſa operatur. Ipſe ergo ut credere incipiamus operatur qui univerſa operatur.</hi> So that it is cleer in the opinion of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that to take both himſelfe and others off from premiſing the foreſight of Faith unto Gods election, it is ſufficient to prove that Faith is the gift of God, the work of God both touching the augmentation, and touching the firſt introduction thereof. And thus evincing the condition of Predeſtination, as excluding all fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of Faith, from the condition of Predeſtination, as being throughout the work of God in man, rather then taking a contrary courſe, as if the main <gap reason="foreign">

what is the condition of Gods decree of Predeſtination, as here it is pretended and ſuppoſed. And albeit it is commonly received of all ſides (as if it were without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion) that Faith is the gift of God: yet we find practiſes on foot, for the working of a manifeſt innovation herein. For not to ſpeak of their interpretations of their own meanings, as, in what ſence they ſay God workes Faith in us; it is apparent the Remonſtrants now a daies, doe as good as profeſſe, that Faith is not beſtowed upon us for Chriſts ſake, in as much as they deny that Chriſt merited Faith for us. For when the Author of the Cenſure paſſed upon the Remonſtrants Confeſſion, diſputeth thus, <hi>At ſi hoc tantum meritus eſt Chriſtus tum Chriſtus nobis non eſt meritus fidem nec regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem:</hi> the Remonſtrants in the Anſwer hereunto, forthwith confeſſe it in theſe <note place="margin">

Let the condition of the decrees be rightly explicated according to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and we ſhall have no need at all of Divinity for the right ordering of them. A meer Logicall faculty by light of nature, will ſerve for this. For the decrees whereof we treat, are meerely <hi>Intentiones rerum gerendarum.</hi> Now for the ordering of theſe in what kind ſoever, we have received Rules of the Schooles, never yet that I know con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by any; namely, that they are to be ordered according to the condition of the things intended, which are but two, to wit, the end and the means; and all doe attribute priority to the intention of the end, and poſteriority to the intention of the means. It is true, men may erre, in deſigning the right end, as alſo, in deſigning the right means, and theſe errours are to be diſcovered, and the truth cleered by that ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereunto the conſideration of the end and means belong, and not by Logick. But agreement being made concerning the end and means, there is no doubt to be made, but that according to the moſt received Rules of Schooles, the end muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged both firſt in intention, and laſt in execution, and contrarily the means laſt in intention and firſt in execution.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. But come we to the Decrees themſelves, &amp; the different opinions thereabouts, which follow in the next place. Now here I looked for different opinions about de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, in the plural number, but I find the relation extends no farther then to one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and that of Reprobation. So at the firſt entrance reaſons are promiſed, even in this writing, to be exhibited <hi>of chang of opinion in certain controverſies</hi> in the plurall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when in the iſſue, all comes but to one controverſy, and that about Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yet the Scripture ſpeaketh fully of Election, ſparingly of Reprobation in moſt places, leaving us to judge thereof, by conſequence from the doctrine of Election Yet ſome paſſages we have (I confeſſe) that give light and evidence to both alike. For like as it is ſaid <hi>Acts</hi> 2. laſt. that <hi>God added daily to the Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi> ſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. it is ſaid, <hi>If our Goſpell be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt,</hi> and as it is ſignified <hi>Math.</hi> 24 24. that Tis impoſſible ſeducers ſhould prevaile over the elect. ſo 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. both as much is ſignified ver. 13. and alſo expreſſed ver. 10. 11. that they ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile among them that periſh: and the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18. we are given to underſtand joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that the preaching of the Croſſe is to them that periſh fooliſhneſſe: but unto us which are ſaved it is the power of God.</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. that <hi>as God hath mercy on whom he will, ſo alſo he hardneth whom he will.</hi> And like as <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 48. we read that, <hi>as many believed as were ordained to eternall life;</hi> which phraſe of ordaining to eternall life, I conceive (under correction) to be all one with the phraſe of <hi>Writing our names in Heaven.

                              <p>I come to the conſideration of the different opinions here propoſed, concerning the decree of Reprobation; and herein, I will endeavour to open a clear way to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56120:9"/>
right underſtanding of the truth, that your judgement may have the more free courſe in diſcerning it, and withall, to repreſent unto you, the unreaſonable carriage of our Adverſaries in the ſetting downe of our Tenent, whereby you may gueſſe, what you are to expect from them proſecuting againſt it. And herein I will inſiſt upon theſe particulars. The firſt ſhall be the Things Decreed. The ſecond the Cauſe of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. The third, the Perſons on whom this Decree doth paſſe. The fourth ſhall be that claw of Unavoydable Sin, and Damnation.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. The Things Decreed are here ſaid to be, <hi>The caſting off from grace and glory, and the ſhutting of men up under Damnation.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Now I pray obſerve here in the firſt place, that, <hi>by caſting off from grace and glory,</hi> we mean no other thing, then the not giving of grace and glory; and by grace, we mean the grace of Faith and Repentance, the grace of Regeneration. For like as in Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God purpoſeth (we ſay) to give this grace unto ſome, which is the ſame with ſhewing mercy on them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. as we ſuppoſe; ſo on the other ſide, God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to deny this grace unto others, which in Scripture phraſe is to harden them, that being made oppoſite to Gods ſhewing mercy. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. And for the farther clearing of the termes we ſay, that God by giving Faith and Repentance, doth cure that infidelity and impenitency, which is naturall unto all, as being borne in ſin: and by not giving this grace of Faith and Repentance unto others, God leaves their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall infidelity and impenitency uncured. And if this Author means ought elſe <hi>by ſhutting up under ſin,</hi> then the not curing of their naturall infidelity and impenitency, he doth us wrong, and what he means thereby I know not. As for ſhutting up under damnation, that is not our phraſe, but we love to ſpeak in plain tearmes, and ſay, that God doth purpoſe to inflict damnation on them whom he Reprobates.</p>
                              <p>Thus much for the cleering of the tearmes, as touching the things Decreed.</p>
                              <p>Secondly, obſerve I pray, which is of principall conſideration, that here we have no cauſe at all ſpecified, why he refuſeth to give them grace; cunningly leaving it to an improvident Reader to conceive, that the cauſe of the decree, which is here ſpecified, to be the meer pleaſure of Gods will, is indifferently applyable <hi>to the not giving of grace and glory, and to the ſhutting up under damnation</hi> as the cauſe thereof, which is a notorious impoſture, yet I doe not think this Author guilty of it, but others rather, who abuſe their witts by cunning courſes, to deceive the hearts of the ſimple. Amongſt the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies obſerved by Ariſtotle, there is one called <hi>Fallacia plurium interrogationum,</hi> as when many things are put together, and an anſwer is required to be made, either affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively or negatively to them all, as if they were but one; when indeed the anſwer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made aright, without diſtinction of the things demanded, the one whereof perhaps requires an anſwer affirmative, the other negative. As for example, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as touching one of the Controverſies here declined: We are often demanded, whether every one that heareth the Goſpell, be not bound to believe that Chriſt died for him? Now I ſay this phraſe <hi>Chriſt died for me</hi> includes many things, as the benefits which ariſe unto me by the death of Chriſt, may be conceived to be many. But let theſe benefits be diſtinguiſhed, and we ſhall readily anſwer to the queſtion made, and that perhaps differently, as namely, affirmatively to ſome, negatively to others; as thus. Doe you ſpeak of Chriſts dying for me, that is, for the pardon of my ſins, and for the ſalvation of my ſoule: I anſwer affirmatively and ſay, I am bound to believe that Chriſt died for the procuring of theſe benefits unto me in ſuch manner, as God hath ordained, to wit, not abſolutely but conditionally, to wit, in caſe I doe believe and repent. For God hath not otherwiſe ordained, that I ſhould reap the benefit of pardon and ſalvation, by vertue of Chriſts Death and Paſſion, unleſſe I believe in him and repent. But if queſtion be made, whether I am bound to believe that Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for me, to procure faith and repentance unto me; I doe not ſay, that I am bound, or that every one who hears the Goſpel, is bound to believe this.</p>
                              <p>Nay the Remonſtrants now a daies, deny in expreſſe tearmes, that Chriſt merited <note place="margin">Cenſura Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurae.</note> this for any at all. I am not of their opinion in this; but I ſee clearly a reaſon mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting, that Chriſt merited not this for all, no not for all and every one, that hears the Goſpel. For if he had, then either he hath merited it for them abſolutely or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally. Not abſolutely, for then all and every one of them ſhould believe <hi>de facto,</hi> which is untrue; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Fides non eſt Omnium:</hi> Nor conditionally, for <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3.</note> what condition I pray can be deviſed, upon the performance whereof, God for Chriſts ſake ſhould give us faith, and repentance? In like ſort, if I am demanded
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56120:10"/>
whether God did decree, of the meer pleaſure of his will, to refuſe to give grace and glory unto ſome, and to inflict upon them damnation. To this I cannot anſwer at once, there being a Fallacy in the demand. But diſtinguiſh them, I anſwer and ſay, that, as touching the poynt of denying grace, God doth that of his meer pleaſure; but as touching the denyall of glory, and the inflicting of damnation, he doth not decree to doe theſe of meer pleaſure, but rather meerly for ſin, to wit, for their infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and impenitency, and all the bitter fruits that ſhall proceed from them. So that Reprobation according to our Tenent rightly ſtated, is the decree of God partly to deny unto ſome, and that of his meer pleaſure, the grace of Faith and Repentance, for the curing of that infidelity and hardnes of heart, which is naturall unto all, and partly to deprive them of glory, and to inflict damnation upon them, not of his meer pleaſure, but meerly for their finall continuance in ſin, to wit, in infidelity and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, and all the fruits that proceed therehence.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. Now as for the cauſe of this decree, as likewiſe of all the decrees of God, when any of our Divines ſay, that it is the meer pleaſure of God, as in ſome places it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed of ſome decrees, let them be underſtood aright; not as if they diſtinguiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the decree of God, and the good pleaſure of his will; for we know full well, that the decree of God is the good pleaſure of his Will, what decree ſoever it be: but hereby we only exclude, all cauſes from without, moving God to make any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; like as when it is ſaid, <hi>Deuteron.</hi> 7. 7. <hi>The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, nor chuſe you, becauſe ye were more in number then any people, but becauſe the Lord loved you,</hi> as much as to ſay, The Lord loved you, becauſe he loved you. Where we cannot ſoberly deviſe any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between love and love, as between the cauſe and the effect; only hereby is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all cauſe from without. Now we are ready with open face to profeſſe, that of the Will and decree of God, there neither is, nor can be any cauſe from without: all things from without being temporall, and the Will of God being eternall, and the Will of God <hi>quoad actum Volentis,</hi> being the very Eſſence of God; For God is a pure Act and that indiviſibly One, whereby he is ſaid to Bee whatſoever he is, as wee doe conceive variety of perfections in God, yet all theſe are but one indiviſible Act in God; and by this one indiviſible Act, he both knowes all that he knowes, and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and decreeth all that he willeth and decreeth. Man when he willeth any thing, as likewiſe an Angel when he willeth ought, they produce an act of willing paſſing upon this or that object: but it is not ſo with God, in whom there is no accident. And therefore <hi>Aquinas</hi> was bold to profeſſe, that never any man was ſo mad, as to <note place="margin">Aquin. 1. q. 23. art. 5. <hi>Nullus fuit ita inſanae mentis ut diceret me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita eſſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam Divinae</hi> Praedeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis ex parte actus Praede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinantis.</note> profeſſe that merits were the cauſe of Predeſtination, as touching the act of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinating: and why ſo? why ſurely upon this ground, becauſe predeſtination is the will of God: and like as nothing can be the cauſe of the will of God, as touching the act of willing, ſo nothing can be the cauſe of divine predeſtination, as touching the act of God predeſtinating. His words are theſe in the ſame place; <hi>Sic inquirenda eſt ratio praedeſtinationis, ſicut inquiritur ratio divinae voluntatis. dictum eſt autem ſuprà, quod non est aſſignare cauſam divinae voluntatis ex parte actus volendi.</hi> But becauſe like as the love of God is ſometime taken for the good thing which God beſtowes, like as <hi>Janſenius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets that place <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14. 21. <hi>He that loveth me ſhall be beloved of my Father,</hi> to wit, of the effect of the Fathers love; and we commonly ſay, that Paſſions are attributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God not <hi>quoad Affectum,</hi> but <hi>quoad Effectum:</hi> in like ſort the Will of God is taken for the thing willed, as 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>This is the will of God, even your ſanctification,</hi> that is, this is willed by him. Therefore <hi>Aquinas</hi> diſtinguiſheth a double conſideration in the will of God, one <hi>quoad actum volentis,</hi> and ſo it hath no cauſe from without; another <hi>quoad res volitas,</hi> and ſo it may have a cauſe. So likewiſe in predeſtination as conſidering it either <hi>quoad actum Praedeſtinantis,</hi> and ſo it hath no cauſe, or <hi>quoad effectum Praedeſtinationis,</hi> and ſo it may have a cauſe, as there he profeſſeth, both touching the will of God in generall, and touching Predeſtination in ſpeciall. Of the will of God in generall, thus; <hi>Non eſt aſſignare cauſam voluntatis divinae ex parte actus volendi, ſed poteſt aſſignari ratio ex parte volitorum, in quantum ſcilicet Deus vult eſſe aliquid propter aliud.</hi> And of predeſtination in ſpeciall, thus; <hi>Sed hoc ſub quaeſtione vertitur, utrum ex parte effectus praedeſtinatio habeat ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam cauſam; &amp; hoc eſt quaerere utrum Deus praeordinaverit ſe daturum effectum praedeſtinationis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licui propter aliqua merita.</hi> Now thus we acknowledge of predeſtination, both in the way of a meritorious cauſe on Chriſts part, and in the way of a diſpoſing cauſe on our part. For God we ſay, hath predeſtinated to beſtow upon us, both grace and glory for Chriſts ſake; where Chriſt is made a meritorious cauſe of grace and glory,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56120:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but not of the act of predeſtination. And farther we ſay, that God hath predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to beſtow glory upon us, as a reward of grace, as a reward of faith, repentance, and good workes: and to this purpoſe it is ſaid that God by his grace, <hi>doth make us meet partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light, Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 12. But as for the beſtowing of grace on any, we ſay there is no cauſe thereof on mans part, For <hi>he hath mercy on whom he will.</hi> Rom. 9. 18. and <hi>he hath called us with an holy calling not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our workes, but according to his own purpoſe and grace.</hi> 2 Timoth. 1. 9.</p>
                              <p>Now let us apply this to reprobation, which is the will of God, as well as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, and if there can be no cauſe of predeſtination <hi>quoad actum Praedeſtinantis,</hi> becauſe there can be no cauſe of the will of God <hi>quoad actum volentis;</hi> Who ſeeth not, that by the ſame reaſon, there can be no cauſe of reprobation <hi>quoad actum reproban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis?</hi> And if it be a mad thing to maintain that merits are the cauſe of predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>quoad actum praedeſtinantis;</hi> it muſt be as mad a thing to maintain, that any merits of the creature, can be the cauſe of reprobation <hi>quoad actum reprobantis.</hi> And this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <hi>Aquinas</hi> applies expreſly to Reprobation it ſelfe, upon the 9. Rom. Lect. 2<hi rend="sup">da</hi>, at the end of theſe words <hi>Praeſcientia peccatorum poteſt eſſe aliqua ratio reprobatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis:</hi> but how? <hi>ex parte actus reprobantis?</hi> nothing leſſe, but rather <hi>ex parte effectus;</hi> and what effect? not the denying of grace, but only as touching the inflicting of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: thus, <hi>Praeſcientia peccatorum poteſt eſſe aliqua ratio reprobationis, ex parte paenae quae praeparatur reprobatis, in quantum ſcilicet Deus proponit ſe puniturum malos propter peccata quae à ſeipſis habent non à Deo.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And farther we prove this, both by cleare evidence of Scripture, and cleare evidence of reaſon, and thirdly by as cleare a repreſentation of their infatuation that oppoſe this doctrine, and particularly of the Author of this diſcourſe.</p>
                              <p>Firſt by cleare evidence of Scripture. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. Where the Apoſtle proves, that Election ſtands not of good works, by an argument drawn from the circumſtance of the time, when that Oracle, <hi>The elder ſhall ſerve the younger,</hi> was delivered; together with the preſent condition of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> anſwerable to that time; thus, <hi>Before the children were borne, or had done good or evill, it was ſaid to Rebecca, The Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger, Therefore the purpoſe of God according to Election ſtands not of good workes.</hi> Now look by what ſtrength of reaſon the Apoſtle concludes this of Election, by the ſame ſtrength of argumentation may I conclude of reprobation, in proportion, thus, Before the Children were borne, or had done Good or Evill, it was ſaid to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca</hi> The Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger; therefore the purpoſe of God according to reprobation, ſtands not of evill workes: that is, like as good workes are not the cauſe of Election, ſo evill workes are not the cauſe of Reprobation, to wit, <hi>quoad actum reprobantis,</hi> as touching the very act and eternall decree of God it ſelfe.</p>
                              <p>Secondly, obſerve, I pray, whether my reaſon be not as cleare; If God upon the foreſight of ſin, doth ordain a man unto damnation; (thus I am content to propoſe it in the moſt rigorous manner) then this is done either by neceſſity of nature, or by the conſtitution of God: Not by neceſſity of nature, as it is confeſſed; and the cauſe is evident, for undoubtedly he could annihilate them, and ſo he can the holieſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that lives, as all ſides confeſſe. Therefore it muſt be by the conſtitution of God: but neither can this hold. For if ſo, then God did conſtitute, that is ordaine, that upon the foreſight of ſin, he would ordaine men unto damnation. Where obſerve that the act of divine ordination, is made the object of divine ordination: as much as to ſay, he did ordaine to ordaine, or he did decree to decree: Whereas the objects of Gods decrees are alwaies things temporall; as for example, We ſay well, God did decree to create the world, to make man out of the earth, to ſend Chriſt into the World, to preſerve us, to redeeme us, ſanctify us, ſave us. But Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or decree is an act eternall, and cannot be the object of his decree or ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I challenge all the Powers of darknes to anſwer this, and to vindicate the Tenent, which I impugne, from that abſurdity, which I charge upon it, if they can.</p>
                              <p>O but ſome will ſay, it's very harſh to ſay, that God of his meer pleaſure doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain men unto damnation.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56120:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I am content to doe my endeavour, to remove this ſcandall out of the way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt hearts, yea and out of the way of others alſo.</p>
                              <p>Firſt therefore conſider, is it fit to reſiſt the evidence of divine truth, becauſe it is harſh to mens affections?</p>
                              <p>Secondly, Wherein conſiſts this harſhneſſe? Is it in this, that nothing is the cauſe of Gods decree? and will nothing temper the harſhnes of it, unles a thing temporall as ſinne, be made the cauſe of Gods will, which is eternall and even God himſelfe? But let us deale plainly, and tell me in truth, whether the harſhnes doth not conſiſt in this, That the meer pleaſure of Gods will, ſeems to be made the cauſe, not of Gods decree only, but of damnation alſo; as if God did damne men, not for ſin, but of his meer pleaſure. And this I confeſſe is wondrous harſh, and yet no more harſh then it is untrue, though in this jugling world, things are ſo carried by ſome, who will both ſhuffle, and cutt, and deale themſelves, as if we made God of meer pleaſure to damne men, and not for ſin, which is a thing utterly impoſſible: damnation being ſuch a notion, as hath eſſentiall reference unto ſin. But if God damne no man but for ſinne, and decreed to damne no man but for ſinne, what if the meer pleaſure of God be the cauſe of this decree; what harſhnes I ſay is this? As for example, <hi>Zimri</hi> or <hi>Cosby</hi> periſhed in their inceſtuous act, and gave up both luſt and ghoſt together, ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were quick to Hell, never fearing the judgements of God, untill they felt them. If we ſay, God decreed they ſhould be cut off in this ſin of theirs, and be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for it, What hatſhnes I pray in this, though God made this decree of meer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? For is it not manifeſt he did? For could he not if it had pleaſed him, have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to outlive this ſin of theirs, and given them ſpace for repentance, and not ſpace only, but grace alſo for repentance, ſeeing as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quantamlibet praebuerit</hi> 
                                 <note place="margin">

                              <p>Now I pray, what is become of the harſhnes of this our Tenent as is pretended? And the truth is, the harſhnes lyeth not here, though our Adverſaries would faine draw it hither, but rather on the other part of reprobation, as it denotes Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for the denying of grace, to wit, the grace of Regeneration, the grace of faith and repentance: but on this part, they are not very forward to cry out upon our Tenent, as ſavouring of harſhnes, but themſelves rather driven to ſuch ſtraites, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deny faith and repentaince to be the gift of God (wherein the Remonſtrants now a daies, are come ſo far as cleerely to profeſſe, that Chriſt merited not faith and Regeneration for any; whence it followeth, that if God doth give faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto any, yet it is not for Chriſts ſake that he gives it,) Or being demanded how it comes to paſſe, that God gives it not to all, if his meer pleaſure be not the cauſe of this difference, as namely in ſhewing mercy unto ſome, when he hardens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they are put upon this ſhift to ſay, that if they would believe, God would give them faith, if they would repent God would give them repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and one that I have had to deale with, on this very argument, ſpares not to profeſſe that God doth work in man <gap reason="foreign">

                              <p>One thing I had almoſt pretermitted, and that was, to repreſent the infatuate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this declaration, to wit, as touching the Authors Tenet in oppoſition to ours, as in ſaying, <hi>that Gods decree to caſt off men for ever, is grounded upon the foreſight of their continuance in ſin and unbeliefe;</hi> For this continuance muſt be underſtood of finall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance therein, leaſt otherwiſe the contradiction to our Tenent be not duely expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Now the foreſight hereof is made to precede Gods caſting men off for ever: but from what? ſurely from grace and glory, in contradiction to our Tenent as here it is ſhaped; and conſequently in election, the foreſight of finall perſeverance in faith and repentance, muſt be ſhaped to precede Gods giving grace, to wit, in another world, as if the other world were appoynted for the giving of grace to ſome, and denying it another; and that the giving of the grace of faith and repentance, and denying it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, was after the one hath perſevered in faith and repentance, and the other in infidelity and impenitency unto the end in this World. For this is it we meane by grace, when we ſay, God in Election deſtinates it to one, and in Reprobation decrees to deny it unto the other; and in contradicting us it is fit they ſhould uſe our termes in our meaning, unles they expreſſe the contrary, and give a reaſon of it.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. As for the Perſons on whom this decree paſſeth, and the aggravation there mentioned, namely of <hi>ſhutting up the greater part of men, even of thoſe that are called,</hi>
                                 <pb n="9" facs="tcp:56120:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                                 <hi>under ſinne and damnation,</hi> This is confeſſed on all hands, That the greateſt part of men are reprobated, even of thoſe that are called; and our Saviour hath expreſly given us to underſtand, <hi>That many are called but few are choſen.</hi> And it is without queſtion, that if it be lawfull for God to deale thus with one, it is as lawfull to deale ſo with the greateſt part, yea with all. And experience juſtifieth that the greateſt part of them that are called doe not performe true faith and repentance: and if they did and dye therein, then the greateſt part of them that are called, ſhould be choſen. Whereby it is manifeſt, that God doth not give Faith and Repentance unto the greateſt part of them that are called; and conſequently, it is nothing ſtrange, that he ſhuts up the greateſt part of them that are called under Damnation. So that in true account there is no weight at all of aggravation in this. Like as you have read in <hi>Newes from Parnaſſus,</hi> that when the French and the Spaniard weighed their powers in the ballance, and the French being found to weigh 25 Millions, and the Spaniard but 20: He thinking to help the matter, and to make himſelfe as weighty as the French, clapped into the ſcale the Kingdome of Naples and the Dukedome of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan; but beyond his expectation, the ſcale proved never a whit the more weighty then before, but lighter rather.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. As for the laſt claw, to help the matter with a couple of Epethetes of <hi>invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible ſin and unavoidable damnation;</hi> one of theſe might have ſufficed to be expreſſed, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undoubtedly Damnation is no otherwiſe avoidable by man, then by avoiding ſin the cauſe thereof. For it is undenyable that man dying in ſin, his damnation is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydable by the whole power of nature.</p>
                              <p>But as for the avoydablenes of ſin, the Author of this Diſcourſe acknowledgeth it no otherwiſe then by grace; and we willingly profeſſe, that all ſin is avoydable by grace. But by the way it is implied, that ſuch a grace is afforded unto all reprobates, whereby they may avoyd that infidelity and impenitency for which they are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But this we deny. For if this were true then all Reprobates were enabled to believe, to repent, to pleaſe God, to diſcerne the things of God, to be ſubject to the Law of God; but to ſay this, is directly to contradict the Word of God, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth of ſome, that <hi>They could not believe Ioh.</hi> 12. 39. of others that <hi>They cannot repent, Rom.</hi> 2. 5.

This cruelty of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> exceeded the bounds of humanity, and yet it comes as ſhort of that, which this way laies to the charge of God, as a temporall death comes ſhort of an eternall, and the power of man in drawing men to offend, comes ſhort of that irreſiſtable power, which the Almighty is able to uſe, in the producing of ſin.</p>

                              <p>THis Authors pretence being only to oppoſe that Tenent, which maintaines that the decree of denying grace and glory, and of inflicting damnation doth not preſuppoſe the foreſight of final perſeverance in ſin, you may well marvaile to what purpoſe this comes in about the different condition of man, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by God either as before the Fall, or after the Fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> it being a queſtion of another nature and meerly Logicall, to wit, about the ordering of Gods decrees of Creation, Permiſſion of the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> giving or denying Grace, Salvation or Damnation. The reſolution whereof, depends upon the right diſtinction of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, in reference to the end, and to the means tending to that end. For this being Reſolved according to the rules of Divinity, the order between them, muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be determined, according to the rules generally received in the Schooles, namely thus, The intention of the end is firſt, then the intention of the means: ſo that if Salvation be the end, and Creation and Permiſſion of Adams Fall and Raiſing therehence by Faith and Repentance to be the means, it muſt be confeſſed, that the decree of Salvation muſt be firſt, then the decree of Creation, permiſſion of ſin, and of raiſing out of ſin. So if the damnation of any be the end that God intends, and creation and permiſſion of ſin, and of finall perſeverance therein be the means; it muſt be acknowledged, that the decree of damnation, was before the decree of creation, &amp;c. But if ſalvation and damnation be no ends intended by God, but means rather, as well as creation, and permiſſion of all to ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> together with the raiſing of ſome therehence, and leaving ſome therein, tending to ſome farther end, namely, the Manifeſtation of Gods glory in a certain kind, as the Scripture together with mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt reaſon doth juſtify. For God being the ſupreame efficient, muſt neceſſarily be the laſt end. And even there where the word of God doth teſtify, that God created the wicked againſt the day of evill, it doth therewithall give to underſtand, that what is ſignified by, <hi>To the day of evill,</hi> doth not denote the end of Gods actions (that before being expreſſed to be God himſelfe, <hi>God made all things for himſelfe,</hi> not for acquiring ought unto himſelfe, for he is ſo perfect, that nothing can be added unto him) but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56120:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the manifeſting of his own moſt glorious nature: ſo that if God be pleaſed to manifeſt his glorious beneficence on man in the higheſt degree, and that in the way of mercy mixt with juſtice; this end requires and beſpeaks both creation (no glory at all being manifeſtable without this) and permiſſion of ſin (otherwiſe it could not be manifeſted in the way of mercy) and ſatisfaction for ſin (otherwiſe this mercy could not be mixed with juſtice exactly) and faith and repentance (otherwiſe the good which God intends could not be beſtowed by way of reward) and laſt of all Salvation, under which we comprehend, the higheſt and moſt bleſſed condition that the nature of man, continuing a meere man, is capable of. And herehence we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that in caſe the end is ſuch as hath been ſpecified, and all theſe actions follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, congruous means tending to that end, therefore the decree of manifeſting Gods glory, as above ſpecified, is firſt with God, and ſecondly the decree of the means; which means although they are many materially, yet they come all under one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall notion of means tending to a certain end, which according to the ſeverall parts thereof beſpeaks them all; and conſequently they are all to be conſidered, as making up the object of one formall decree, called the decree of the means: and the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of none of them is before another, but all intended at once, as means tending to that end which is firſt intended. In like manner if God ſhall be pleaſed to intend the manifeſtation of his glory in Man or Angell, in the way of juſtice vindicative, the means neceſſarily required hereunto are, Creation, Permiſſion of ſin, and Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto puniſhment, and all three makes up the object of one formall decree, which is to be called the decree of the means. So that like as God doth not intend the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures creation, before he intends his damnation, in the ſame reſpect he cannot be ſaid to intend his damnation, before he intends his creation, or the permiſſion of his ſinne.</p>
                              <p>And this rightly conſidered, ſets an end unto all quarrell about the different conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Man in election and reprobation, which yet is about a Schoole point on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, touching the right ſtateing of the end and the means, and the right ordering of Gods decrees concerning them. And doth it not ſet an end alſo, to all aſperſions of cruelty caſt upon the holy providence of God, from the guilt of which kind of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, nothing can free them; but confidence in their own way, as if it were the way of truth, and that by convincing evidence of holy Scripture? Whereas it appears how little direction they take from the Word of God throughout, for the ſhaping of their Tenent in this. Yet neither is any ſuch confidence, able to free them from the guilt of ſuch blaſphemies which they utter: well it may free them from the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it, yet if it doe, that is more than I know. And only to theſe two ends doth this aliene diſcourſe of our different opinions thereabouts tend, as I conceive; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſhew the difference of our Divines, and to give vent to thoſe aſperſions of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy on the firſt way, as alſo to make way for a third in part, which comes to be conſidered in the next Section, in the manner how they fall upon the relation of the ſecond way.</p>
                              <p>Yet <hi>Arminius</hi> in his Conference with <hi>Junius,</hi> might have informed him of three opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions concerning the object of Predeſtination, dividing the fruit of theſe into two. The condition of man before the Fall, being conſiderable two waies, either as before the Fall, but after Creation, which they call <hi>the Maſſe created, but not yet corrupted;</hi> or as not before the Fall only, but before the creation alſo, which we commonly call the Maſſe not yet created, or Mankind not yet created. As touching the moſt harſh way of theſe three, upon examination of <hi>Arminius</hi> his twenty arguments againſt it, I find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth the ſpeaking of, but meere ſuggeſtion of fleſh and bloud, which yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duely pondered, doe diſcover moſt ſhamefull nakednes.</p>
                              <p>His arguments againſt the making of Mankind not yet created, the object of prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, I have propoſed and anſwered in my <hi>Vindiciae gratiae Dei, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>De Praedeſtin. digreſſ.</hi> 5. if this Author hath any mind to be doing with them, I ſhall be ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what he ſaith, as God ſhall give opportunity.</p>
                              <p>And in <hi>Junius</hi> you ſhall finde, how he laboureth to reconcile them, but very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely. <hi>Piſcator</hi> alſo ſets hand to the ſame work, and carryeth himſelfe therein (as his manner is) very clearely, by diſtinguiſhing three acts in Predeſtination. The firſt whereof he will have to preſuppoſe Mankind not created; for it is the decree of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating man to different ends. The ſecond, he will have to preſuppoſe Mankind crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but not corrupted: for it is the decree of permitting <hi>Adam</hi> to fall, and all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56120:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in him. The third and laſt he will have to preſuppoſe Mankind both created and corrupted; for it is the decree of raiſing ſome out of ſin, wherein they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and borne, and leaving ſome therein. As for the Angells it is without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that election and reprobation divine had courſe concerning them, as well as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning mankind, and as certain it is, that no corrupt Maſſe could be the object of divine Predeſtination in their election and reprobation.</p>
                              <p>As for <hi>Arminius</hi> his ordering of Gods decrees in oppoſition to theſe waies taken by our Divines, that he hath communicated unto us, in the Declaration of his opinion before the States, <hi>pag</hi> 47. where leaving out the decree of creating mankind in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and the decree of permitting all mankind to fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> he takes into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration only, the divine decrees of ſaving ſinfull man.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. The firſt whereof is, <hi>Whereby he decreed to make his Sonne Chriſt a Mediator, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, Saviour, Prieſt and King, by his death to aboliſh ſin, by his obedience to obtain Salvation (formerly loſt) and by his power to communicate it.</hi> And this decree he ſaith is abſolute.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. The ſecond is, <hi>Whereby he decreed to receive into grace ſuch as believe and repent, and thoſe perſevering unto the end, to ſave in Chriſt, for and by Chriſt: but ſuch as believe and repent not, to leave under ſin and wrath, and to damne as aliene from Christ.</hi> Where obſerve, 1. This decree of ſaving ſuch as believe and repent, he calleth a decree abſolute, yet this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree paſſeth upon no particular perſons: ſuch a decree is reſerved for the laſt place. 2. God (with him) receives none into grace and favour, unles they believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: Whereby it is manifeſt, that with him faith and repentance are no fruits of Gods grace and favour: for they muſt be performed before they are received into Gods grace and favour.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. The third is, <hi>Where by he decreed ſufficiently and efficaciouſly to adminiſter the means which are neceſſary to faith and repentance.</hi> This decree whether he conceives it to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute or no, he doth not ſpecify; nor whether he decreed to adminiſter them unto all, nor by whom, whether by men only, or by men or Angells, nor whether by means he underſtands the Goſpel only, and we have cauſe to doubt thereof. And laſtly, which is moſt obſcure, he doth not explicate what he means, by ſufficient and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious adminiſtration. Only he adds, that in this adminiſtration, he carries himſelfe according, 1. <hi>To his Wiſdome, which ſhewes what becomes his mercy andſeverity,</hi> and 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> 
                                 <hi>to his Juſtice, whereby he is ready to follow the preſcript of his Wiſdome.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="4">4. The fourth and laſt is, <hi>Whereby he decreed to ſave and damne certain particular perſons.</hi> Now whereas our Divines generally, what way ſoever they took, had a care out of their Logick and Philoſophy which they had by light of nature, to order the decrees divine, according to the common Rules of Art concerning intentions, as they are found to be either of ſome end, or of ſome means tending to an end, this ſeems to have been no part of <hi>Arminius</hi> his care. This order of his, I have ranſaked in my <hi>Vindiciae. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>digreſſ.</hi> 2. And if this Author think good, he may anſwer thereunto, and doe his beſt to qualify the abſurdities wherewith I charge that order of his.</p>
                              <p>But as touching the embracers of this firſt way, whoſe names he expreſſeth, he had need to prove it.

                                 <hi>Whitaker</hi> taught and Preached publiquely in the Univerſity of Cambridge, being at that time <hi>Profeſſor Regius.</hi> And ſeeing we acknowledge the ſeeming harſhnes of it, as well as our Adverſaries, yet becauſe we find it revealed in Gods word, we hold it our duty to embrace it, and therehence conclude that it is <hi>aequiſſimum.</hi> Doth it become any one to take the courſe this Author takes, and by a Parallel between this courſe of God, and the courſes of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as alſo by a ſaying of <hi>Zeno's</hi> ſervant, to cry it down as <hi>iniquiſſimum,</hi> and thence to conclude hand over head, that the word of God doth not teach it? Is this a Chriſtian courſe? is this Theologicall? is this Scholaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call? Yet in my judgement the harſhnes lyeth not here, to wit, in the point of Gods purpoſe to inflict damnation; conſidering that not one of our divines, that I know, doth maintaine that God did ever purpoſe to inflict damnation, but for ſin. Or if there be any harſhnes therein, that is to be found in the kind and degree of puniſhment and everlaſtingneſſe thereof, God holding them everlaſtingly as it were upon the rack and in quick ſence of torment. And yet we maintaine without contradiction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians, that it is juſt with God to doe ſo for one act of drunkennes or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, or the like unrepented of; which kind of puniſhment, never any Tyrant in the world was known to take, or could take. But the harſhnes in my opinion, is moſt pregnant to bring forth diſtaſt on the other part of reprobation, which is the purpoſe of God to deny grace, this being denied to whom he will, and that of meer pleaſure; for like as he ſhewes mercy on whom he will, ſo the Scripture teſtifies, that he hardens whom he will.

take notice, how unſavoury this doctrine is in the judgement of fleſh and bloud, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in comparing it with Gods ordinary courſe of complaining of men for their diſobedience, even of thoſe whom himſelfe hath hardned, but the holy Apoſtle alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 19. <hi>Thou wilt ſay then,</hi> and is it ſo, doth God harden whom he will? <hi>Why then doth he yet complaine?

                              <p>But let us come to the conſideration of the Parallel here made between the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of <hi>Tiberius</hi> and the counſells of God. This conſiſts of two parts, according to a double ſtory of <hi>Tiberius</hi> taken out of <hi>Suetonius.</hi>

                              <p>Yet there is a greater power of provocation unto ſin then all theſe, &amp; that is by the practiſes of Satan, who <hi>goeth about like a roaring Lyon ſeeking who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he may devoure.</hi> How coms he to have ſuch liberty? Hath not God power to bind Satan for a thouſand years and more if it pleaſe him? The Devills ſometime beſought our Saviour, that he would not ſend them into the deep; ſurely they acknowledged thereby his power to ſend them thither; yet he did not, though he was not ignorant, that their going about was like ſo many roaring lyons, to devoure the ſoules of men by provoking unto ſin. As for thoſe that <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſet about <hi>Druſus</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> to provoke them, what were they comparable to the Devill and his Angells for the practiſing of provoking courſes? But <hi>Tiberius</hi> bid his ſervants to provoke <hi>Druſus</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> and not to ſpare: but can any ſay truely that we maintaine that God bids the Devill to provoke this Author, or any ſuch <hi>Arminian</hi> ſpirit to make ſuch parallels as theſe? Yet 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. we read when a wicked ſpirit offers his ſervice to God to intice <hi>Ahab that he might goe and fall at Ramoth-Gilead,</hi> &amp; that by becoming a lying ſpirit in the mouth of all his Prophets, the Lord not only accepts it, ſaying, Goe forth and doe ſo; but alſo tells him, <hi>thou ſhalt entice him, and ſhalt alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile.</hi> That was a great deale more then was in the power of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> or his inſtigators, or the Devills themſelves. And did not <hi>Ahab</hi> deſerve as much at the hands of God? And why might not this Author and his fellowes, have deſerved ſo much at the hands of God, as to have a lying ſpirit put in the mouthes of them, on whom they depend for reſolution in poynts of Divinity, and that they prevaile with them alſo? And why may not he alſo be thus given over to illuſions to believe lies? Nay, what doe we talk of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert in this? Did not the Devill provoke <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> to ſin againſt God in Paradiſe? Could not God have kept the Devill off? Why did he not? <hi>Cur non interceſſit &amp; circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptorem colubrum cohibuit?</hi> to ſpeak in <hi>Tertullians</hi> phraſe. Doth it not manifeſtly appeare, that it was Gods will to have them tempted, to have them provoked unto ſin? &amp; why not? Is it lawfull for a man to lay a bait of gold and ſilver in his ſervants way to try his fidelity, and whether ſuch a provocation will make a breach upon his honeſty; and ſhall not ſuch a courſe be lawfull unto God? for this nothing hinders their liberty of tranſgreſſing. And to ſerve God while we are not tempted to ſin againſt him, is a poor commendation: <hi>If thou faint in the day of adverſity thy ſtrength is ſmall,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon.

of his wanton Miſtris: though <hi>David</hi> fell fowlly and ſhamefully, provoked thereunto by the ſight of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and did not God by his providence bring him to the ſight of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> as he brought <hi>Shimei</hi> and <hi>David</hi> after this together, as <hi>Arminius</hi> and his complices confeſſe, when <hi>Shimei</hi> railed on him? A great provocation to ſo great a Perſon as <hi>David,</hi> if not to bid, yet at leaſt to ſuffer <hi>Abiſhai</hi> to cut off that doggs head, as he called him; yet <hi>David</hi> would not ſuffer him, and why? Let <hi>David</hi> himſelfe anſwer; <hi>The Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath bidden him to curſe David. It may be the Lord will render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me good, for his curſing this day.</hi> He fell not foule upon God, though acknowledging his juſt providence herein. And to make a Parallele between the courſes of God, and the courſes of <hi>Tiberius</hi> that monſter of men, in taking a courſe with <hi>Druſus</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> to provoke them to the reproaching of him, that he might deſtroy them: Thus <hi>David</hi> was not corrupted with the provocations of his Subject, as <hi>Druſus</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> were by a fellow Subject to convitiate their Prince. Neither did he fare the worſe for this, but no doubt found cauſe to bleſſe God for his grace, in reſtraining him from breaking forth into any intemperancy of tongue or ſpirit, like as formerly he bleſſed God for the good counſel of <hi>Abigal,</hi> whereby he was reſtrained from ſhedding bloud, and that his own hand did not ſave him. And if it be not lawfull for us to provoke another unto ſin, will it follow forthwith, that it is not lawfull for God to provoke? One is provoked by proſperity to corrupt his waies, another by adverſity is provoked to break forth into impatience and blaſphemy? What then? ſhall not God be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be the Author both of proſperity and adverſity? Nay, what doth the Lord long before profeſſe what ſhould be his providence towards the Jewes? and that in this very kind of provoking them. <hi>Deutron.</hi> 32. 21. <hi>They have moved me to jealouſy with that which is not good, they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealouſy with thoſe that are no people, I will provoke them to anger with a fooliſh Nation.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But let us conſider more diſtinctly, what this act of provocation is, and wherein it conſiſts, that we may be the better able to judge in what caſe we may ſafely attribute it unto God, and in what caſe not, that ſo we may neither aſcribe that unto him which doth not become him, nor deny that unto him which doth become him, both theſe courſes being equally blaſphemous, and ſo reputed among Schoole Divines.</p>
                              <p>Now Provocation in the moſt uſuall phraſe of Scripture is by way of exaſperation, and it is an incitation unto wrath; and never otherwiſe taken when man is ſaid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God. And in the ſame ſenſe it is delivered in the particular fact of <hi>Tiberius</hi> here mentioned. But when a reſemblance is here made between the particular courſe of <hi>Tiberius</hi> and the courſes of God, Gods provocation of man is not to wrath only, but meant of incitation to any kind of ſin, whether it be by way of exaſperation, or by way of alluring and enticing, according to the ſeverall paſſions and affections of man, which are apt to be moved ſeverall waies to ſin, amongſt which the paſſion anger is but one. And as it is ſaid of the wrath of man, that it workes not the righteouſneſſe of God; ſo it is verified of every other inordinate affection. In the 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 1. it is ſaid that Satan <hi>provoked David to number Iſrael.</hi> That was not by way of exaſperation and moving in him the paſſion of anger, by the working upon ſome other paſſion, whether pride or curioſity: and therefore though it be rendred by the word, Provoked, yet in the Originall the word uſed ſignifieth properly to tempt. But conſider we provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on according to the propriety thereof in the firſt place, by way of exaſperation.</p>
                              <p>Now conſider, I pray, whether the Miniſters of <hi>Tiberius</hi> did more exaſperate <hi>Druſus</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> then God exaſperated <hi>Ionah. Ionah.</hi> 4. 7. For having prepared a <hi>Gourd and made it to come up over Ionah, that it might he a ſhaddow over his head, and deliver him from his griefe; &amp; Ionah being exceeding glad of the Gourd, God prepared a worme when the morning roſe the next day and it ſmote the Gourd that it withered.</hi> And God proceeded farther then this. <hi>For when the Sun did ariſe, God prepared alſo a fervent eaſt wind, and the Sun heat upon the head of Ionah, that he fainted and wiſhed in his heart to dye, and ſaid it is better for me to dye then to live.</hi> And not only ſo, but juſtified himſelfe in this his impatience. For when the Lord ſaid unto him, <hi>doeſt thou well to be angry for the Gourd? Ionah</hi> ſtoutly anſwered, <hi>I doe well to be angry to the death.</hi> It's true, <hi>Ionah</hi> brake not forth into blaſphemies againſt God, as it ſeems <hi>Druſus</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> did againſt <hi>Tiberius. Ionah</hi> was better brought up under the wings of God then ſo. Gods grace preſerved him from ſuch exceſſe, but that the Miniſters <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> ſet about them, did more provoke them by exaſperating courſes, then God did in like manner provoke <hi>Ionah,</hi> it doth not appeare: but had <hi>Ionah</hi> hereupon broken forth into blaſphemies, had <hi>Ionah's</hi> ſinne been excuſable or Gods courſe blameable?

                                 <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 21. we read of <hi>a great hayle that fell upon the men like Talents out of heaven, and men blaſpheamed God becauſe of the plague of the hayle, for the plague thereof was exceeding great.</hi> And <hi>Iſai</hi> 8. 21. The Lord prophecyeth, that, <hi>He that is afflicted and famiſhed, ſhall goe to and fro, and when he ſhall be hungry, he ſhall even fret himſelfe, and curſe his King and his Gods and look upward.</hi> ſuch plagues are the work of God, for <hi>there is no evill in the citty but the Lord hath done it.</hi> Amos 3. But let them look unto it, that thereupon take occaſion to blaſpheme. And <hi>Tentatio probationis</hi> was never yet that I know denyed unto God, to try whether they will blaſpheme God or no. To this end Satan deſired to have an hand on <hi>Job,</hi> yet not ſo much to try whether he would blaſpheme or no, but being confident he ſhould bring him to blaſpheme. <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>ſtretch out now thine hand and touch all that he hath, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> The Lord gave him leave, and <hi>Job</hi> acknowledgeth the Lords hand in all that Satan did, ſaying, <hi>The Lord gave and the Lord takes away, yet in all this Job ſinned not nor charged God fooliſhly.</hi> Satan deſires yet farther liberty, ſaying <hi>skin for skin, yea all that a man hath will he give for his life. But put forth thy hand now and touch his bone, and his fleſh, and he will curſe thee to thy face. And the Lord ſaid unto Satan, Behold he is in thy hand, but ſave his life. So went Satan forth from the preſence of the Lord, and ſmote Job with ſore boyles from the ſole of his foot unto his crowne, and he took him a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhard to ſcrape himſelfe withall, and he ſate down among the aſhes, Then ſaid his Wife unto him, Doeſt thou yet continue in thy integrity? Curſe God and dye.</hi> She manifeſted the inward cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of her irreligious heart. <hi>Job</hi> might have brought her to a forme of godlines by his pious courſes in his family, but litle power of godlineſſe doth appeare upon her. For as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>If thou faint in the day of adverſity thy ſtrength is ſmall.</hi> It ſeems her heart was ſowred with Atheiſme, thinking the world was governed by chance, rather then by divine providence, and conſequently it was all one, whether a man did bleſſe God, or curſe God, and a madneſſe to make a conſcience of walking in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and that in <hi>Iobs</hi> caſe at this time, whether he did bleſſe God he muſt dye, or whether he did curſe God he could but dye, and better it was for him thus impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, thus afflicted, to dye then to live; as for the powers of the world to come, it ſeems ſhe never had but a taſt of them, and that taſt never produced any true faith in her concerning them. Here was a ſore temptation, the very gates of hell playing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with their greateſt Ordinance to batter (if it were poſſible) his ſhield of faith. But what is <hi>Iobs</hi> anſwer. <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh women ſpeaketh. What ſhall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive good at the hand of God and ſhall we not receive evill? In all this did not Iob ſin with his lips.</hi> The worke of Satan in the impoveriſhing of <hi>Iobs</hi> eſtate, and afflicting his perſon, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied to be Gods work. As for the work of his wife, why might not that be the work of God, as well as the work of Satan? For did not Satan ſin in all this? As our Saviour ſaith that he was a murtherer from the beginning, and as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                                 <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>The devill goes about like a roring Lyon ſeeking whom he may devoure;</hi> ſo who can make doubt but theſe courſes practiſed againſt <hi>Iob,</hi> were fruits of his murthering and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring diſpoſition? And all ſides now a daies confeſſe, that the act of the moſt flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſin committed by man or Angell, is the work of God in the way of a principall efficient cauſe, as well as it is the work of the creature. And as for the ſinfulneſſe of the act, either of the Devill or his Wife, that was not it which did or could hurt <hi>Iob:</hi> but the works wrought by Satan, the temptation atheiſticall propoſed by his Wife, this was the greateſt danger in the conſideration thereof to corrupt his ſoule, for that is it alone that workes upon the will to incline it. And as for their ſinning herein, that proceeded from the want of Gods feare, according to that of <hi>Abraham.

                              <p>But let us proceed to provocations unto other ſins, not in the way of exaſperation, but in the way of allurements. <hi>Achan</hi> was a covetous perſon, at the ſacking of Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho, it was his hap to light among the ſpoyle, upon a goodly Babyloniſh garment, and two hundred ſhekells of ſilver, and a wedge of gold of fifty ſhekells waight. Was not ſo faire a prey, a ſore temptation to a covetous perſon? How was <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a rich bowle that was ſhewed him by <hi>Harpalus,</hi> but there was great danger in it, I confeſſe, yet <hi>if deſire of prey doth ſometimes overrun the ſent,</hi> may it not as well over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the feare of danger, eſpecially conſidering the opportunity of ſecrecy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey it cloſely into his Tent and hide it there? I ſaw, ſaith he, and I coveted them and took them, and behold they lye hid in the earth in the midſt of my Tent, and the ſilver under it. Now can it be denied, but that God by his providence brought him into this temptation, and conſequently into this provocation, for to tempt is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 1. And is it not juſt with God, to bring any man into ſuch tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of what kind, or in what degree ſoever (ſeeing no temptation or provocation in this kind or degree, bereaves a man of the liberty of his will) If not, what meant our Saviour to teach his Diſciples, and in them us, to pray unto God that <hi>He will not lead us into temptation?</hi> And what cauſe hath <hi>Achan</hi> to complaine of this temptation? We do not read he did; was it not the condition of many others as well as himſelfe? Was this prey that he ceazed on, the only ſpoyle of that great Citty? Were there no Babyloniſh garments but that one, no more ſilver or wedges of gold, but that <hi>Achan</hi> lighted on? Yet they refrained, ſome out of the feare of God, that reſtrained them in a gracious manner, and kept them from ſinning againſt him: others though not out out of a feare of God, yet out of the feare of puniſhment, were moved to beware how they tranſgreſſed. For albeit, <hi>Libertas ſine gratia non eſt libertas, ſed contumacia,</hi> as * <hi>Auſtin</hi>

writes, yet feare of puniſhment oftimes reſtraines from committing capitall crimes, though this reſtraint be not gracious; and conſiderations of leſſe force then theſe doe prevaile many times with carnall men, both to abſtain from evill, and to doe that which is good, though not in a gracious manner. As we read in the Goſpell of a wicked Judge, that neither feared God nor reverenced man, yet he would doe the Widdow juſtice to eaſe himſelfe of her importunate ſollicitations where with ſhe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted him.</p>
                              <p>Come we to provocations unto ſinne of another nature, in ſatisfying the concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the fleſh. <hi>David</hi> ariſing out of his bed at eventide, and walking upon the roof of the Kings Pallace, <hi>from the roofe he ſaw a Woman waſhing her ſelfe: and the Woman was very beautifull to look upon:</hi> we know what followed hereupon. Now was it not God that lead him into this temptation, into this provocation? Surely if this were not juſt with God, it were in vaine for us to pray, that God will not lead us into temptation; for we need not feare any ſuch temptation, which cannot befall us without violation of Gods juſtice in the courſe of his providence. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, <hi>leaſt he ſhould be exalted out of meaſure, through the abundance of revelations</hi> (made unto him, which were very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to puff a man up, and make him ſwell in the conceit of his own worthineſſe being admitted into the ſecrets of God) was ſometimes exerciſed <hi>with a thorne in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan ſent to buffet him.</hi> But the feare of God was alive in him, and ſtirred up his faith to pray unto God three times <hi>that it might depart from him:</hi> and the Lord made him a gracious anſwer, not as yet to deliver him, but to ſupport him in this conflict, and give him the victory over it. For the Lord ſaid unto him, <hi>my grace is ſufficient for thee, for my power is made perfect in thy weakneſſe.</hi> This anſwer put heart into <hi>Paul; Therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>will I very gladly rejoyce rather in mine infirmities that the power of Chriſt may dwell in me.</hi> Mark I pray, <hi>Rahter,</hi> in mine infirmities. He would not blame God for thus exerciſing him, but rather rejoyce to be thus exerciſed, for as much as this ſame ſhould doe him no harme; for by vertue of Chriſts power dwelling in him he ſhould have the victory. Secondly, it ſhould doe him good in preſerving him <hi>from being exalted out of meaſure through the abundance of revelations. Therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in infirmities, in reproaches, in neceſſities, in perſecutions, in anguiſhes for Chriſts ſake; for when I am weak then am I ſtrong.</hi> And had not <hi>Joſeph</hi> as good cauſe to conceive that it was the will of God, that he by the unchaſt motions of his wanton Miſtris, ſhould be provoked unto unclean courſes, as <hi>David</hi> had to perſwade himſelfe, that it was Gods will by the rayling of <hi>Shimei</hi> he ſhould be provoked unto revenge; that ſo by the power of his grace, ſtrengthning them againſt ſuch provocations, they might come forth of their ſeverall temptations, as gold out of fire, more bright more reſplendent then before? <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was a faire perſon and well favoured <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 39. 6. Now this was a ſore provocation to a luſtfull eye. Beauty is ſaid to be of a dangerous nature, as that which makes a man either <hi>Praedonem alienae caſtitatis</hi> or <hi>Praedam ſuae.</hi> But Joſeph had a gracious and a chaſt heart, his beauty gave him no encouragement to prey upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers chaſtity, but being a congruous baite to the luſtfull appetite of his Miſtris, it was in danger to expoſe his own chaſtity to be preyed upon. And as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid of Gods providence concerning <hi>Shimei, ejus voluntatem proprio vitio ſuo malam in hoc peccatum judicio ſuo juſto &amp; occulto inclinavit.</hi> Who ſeeth not, that the like may be ſaid of Gods dealing with <hi>Ioſeph's</hi> Miſtris? and that without all aſperſion of unholineſſe unto God. For if he gives Men or Women over unto their luſts, what will be the iſſue but uncleanneſſe: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 24, 26. When God gave them up to vile affections, what followed but this? <hi>even their Women did change their naturall uſe into that which was againſt nature,</hi> verſ. 27. <hi>and likewiſe alſo the Men left their naturall uſe of the Women, and burned in their luſt one toward ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and Man with Man wrought filthineſſe, and received in themſelves ſuch recompence of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour as was meet.</hi> Here we have a ſtrange courſe of Gods providence in puniſhing ſin with ſin. For theſe Gentiles in defiling themſelves one with another, in a moſt unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and abominable manner, are ſaid to receive <hi>ſuch recompence for their errour as was meet.</hi> In few words, what is meant by provocation unto any ſin? Is it to doe that whereupon man may take juſt cauſe or occaſion to doe that which he doth without blame? like as the Corinthians provoked <hi>Paul, as a foole to loaſt himſelfe,</hi> as himſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it, for he adds, <hi>ye have compelled me.</hi> But this cannot be affirmed of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his miniſters in provoking <hi>Druſus</hi> and <hi>Nero.</hi> For no provocation could be ſufficient to make them unblameable in convitiating their Prince, much leſſe can it be ſaid, that God provokes any man in this manner: neither doe I think that any of our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56120:17"/>
(as malevolent as they are) dares impute any ſuch crimination unto us, as if wee attributed any ſuch diſcourſe unto providence divine. What then is it to provoke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin? Is it to doe ſomewhat upon the conſideration whereof, mens paſſions being moved, they cannot but ſin. But this in like ſort is equally as untrue, as the former, even of thoſe provocations which were made upon <hi>Druſus</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> by the practiſes of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> Or is it the doing of ſomewhat, whereupon occaſion is taken to ſinne, to blaſpheme? this hath no colour of truth in it. For even man without all tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may doe many things, whereupon occaſion is taken of doing evill, and therefore we diſtinguiſh of <hi>Scandalum datum &amp; Acceptum.</hi> Nay, though man knowes offence will be taken upon the doing of ſome things, yet if the doing thereof be commanded by God, he muſt doe them, what occaſion ſoever is thereby taken to offend. Indeed if they are things indifferent, I muſt abſtaine from the doing of them, in caſe I know of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence will be taken thereat, and that thereby I ſhall lay a ſtumbling block in the way of my Brother. For <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth that if meat would offend his Brother, he would never eat meat rather then offend his Brother. But no ſuch obligation lies upon God. For he knoweth full well how ſome will abuſe his mercies, others grow worſe and worſe by his judgements, breaking forth into blaſphemy thereupon: yet no wiſe man will ſay that God is the more unholy in the ſhewing of mercy, and in the execution of judgement. He profeſſeth in plain termes, that to them who feare him <hi>he will be a ſanctuary, but as a ſtumbling block, and as a rock to fall upon to both the houſes of Iſrael, and as a ſnare, and as a net, to both the Inhabitants of Ieruſalem, Iſai.</hi> 8. 14.</p>
                              <p>As for the laſt clauſe of this odious Parallel, concerning the end of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his courſe in this, namely <hi>that ſo he might cover his cruelty in their death under pretext of juſtice.</hi> Undoubtedly I ſhould think the putting of them to death was juſt in caſe they did convitiate their Prince whatſoever their provocations were. For hereby they deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved death, yea everlaſting death and damnation. His ſin was in cauſing them to be provoked hereunto, and ſo alſo it might be in the manner of their execution. For it is written of him that <hi>fame necavit,</hi> he famiſhed them. I know <hi>Tiberius</hi> was cruell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but by the ſtory it ſeems, that policy, wicked policy moved him unto this; firſt to intend their deaths becauſe he ſaw the affections of the people towards them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like for <hi>Germanicus</hi> his ſake, a worthy man according to thoſe times.

For certainly though <hi>Adam</hi> were created in innocence, yet he preſerv'd him not in innocency, but left him to himſelfe, having expoſed him to Satans temptations.

And indeed it is evident in reaſon and ſuch as cannot be denied, unleſſe a man will ſay, that whatſoever courſe had been taken by God to preſerve him from ſinne, without prejudice to the freedome of his will, yet nevertheleſſe he would have ſinned: which is in ſo high a degree abſurd, as manifeſtly to contradict the very light of nature.

For ſuch a condition is not an indifferent condition.

Here is a ſtrange maſſacre wrought by <hi>Sampſon</hi> an Iſraelite upon the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins, at that time when the Iſraelites were in ſubjection to the Philiſtins who were their Lords, as ſometimes <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was.

                              <p>I come to the ſecond inſtance here made of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his cruelty, which he compares to thoſe courſes, which we out of holy Scripture have learned, to be attributed unto God himſelfe. Now this hath long agoe been objected by <hi>Bertius,</hi> in his Preface to the Conference of <hi>Arminius</hi> with <hi>Iunius;</hi> I ſay objected by him unto <hi>Piſcator,</hi> &amp; thereunto <hi>Piſcator</hi> alſo hath anſwered long agoe. And whereas <hi>Bertius</hi> hath replyed and allowed <hi>Piſcator</hi> a year for putting in his anſwer thereunto, whereof had he failed, he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it as a confeſſion of his inſufficiency, to make good the cauſe maintained by him. <hi>Piſcator</hi> anſwers, that he had no need of ſo long a time as he preſcribed him, for after he had read over his book, in the ſpace of two or three daies he addreſſed himſelfe to an anſwer thereunto, and within a month finiſhed it. Now if the Author of this diſcourſe were ignorant hereof, his ignorance might excuſe him, if otherwiſe he might have, with more credit, occupied himſelfe in the anſwering, at the leaſt, of ſome chief particulars, whereupon <hi>Piſcator</hi> ſtands, for the juſtifying of his doctrine delivered by him, not of his own brain, but according to the word of God, then hand over head, to hold up the crimination without taking notice of the dilution thereof, many years a goe propoſed and ſet forth to the judgement of the world. But I am content to take into conſideration, how Scholaſtically and judiciouſly he carrieth himſelfe in this crimination, as well as in the former: and the rather, becauſe it may be that this odious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon he makes more account of (for the preparation of his Auditors to entertain that which followes with the more propitious affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) then he doth of the ſtrength of ought that follows, whatſoever he doth or may prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the point the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Tiberius</hi> commanded the Virgins to be defloured, that they might be ſtrangled. Now is there any carriage of God taught by us like unto this? If God were diſpoſed to ſtrangle any, certainly he hath no need to have the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> defloured firſt. For it is now a daies confeſſed even by Arminius himſelfe, that God can lawfully annihilate the holieſt creature that lives, and that without all reſpect to ſin, or the vitiation of them. And annihilation I think is much more then ſtrangulation; this cauſing only a diſſolution between the body and ſoule, but annihilation, ſetting an utter end to body &amp; ſoule by turning them both into nothing. And farther, had <hi>Tiberius</hi> only permitted the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flouring of them, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he might have hindered it, though this were a foule part in him, yet I hope no Chriſtian will ſay, it is a foule part in God, to permit any act never ſo flagitious, or facinorous when he is able to hinder it; eſpecially when he may hinder it without any prejudice to the liberty of mans will: and that this is in Gods power <hi>Arminius</hi> acknowledgeth and ſuppoſeth at large in his <hi>Examen</hi> and Treatiſe there <hi>De Permiſsione.</hi> But <hi>Tiberius</hi> commanded the Hangman to defloure them. But is this our doctrine, that God commanded the raviſhing of any, the murthering of any, or any other ſin whatſoever? Do we not all teach rather, that God forbids it, and that under
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56120:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
penalty of everlaſting death? yet it is true, the word of God expreſſely profeſſeth out of the mouth of <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>God bad Shimei to curſe David,</hi> and that he bid the evill ſpirit to ſeduce <hi>Ahab,</hi> that he might goe up to Ramoth-Gilead, and that not to be ſtrangled I confeſſe, but, which was nothing better to him, that he might fall, and be ſlain there. But this is a figurative ſpeech, and ſignifies not properly any command of God, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denotes the ſecret operation of Gods providence in the hearts of men, even of wicked men; for thoſe as well as Devills, God knows how to make uſe of, to ſerve his own turne.

And I hope it was no juſt excuſe for the people of Iſrael in their Idolatrous courſes, that therein they did but keep the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of <hi>Omri,</hi> and all the manner of the houſe of <hi>Ahab, Mic.</hi> 6. Yet neither doth God command any man to doe that which his Law forbids, or to ſin againſt him. And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we acknowledge with <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that ſin hath no efficient cauſe, but deficient. And it is enough with God to expoſe any man to ſin, by not working him to that which is good; it being his office to work us to every thing that is pleaſing in his ſight. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 20. to cauſe us to walk in his ſtatutes, and judgements, and to doe them, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. 28. yea, to keep us from preſumptious ſins, and that they get not the dominion over us. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 14. yea, to deliver us from every evill work, 2 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
                              <p>But perhaps ſome may ſay; Our doctrine is that God willeth ſin to be committed for which men may and ſhall be puniſhed; like as <hi>Tiberius</hi> would the Virgins ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floured, that they might be ſtrangled.</p>
                              <p>And I anſwer, that <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe profeſſeth that, <hi>Deus voluit Achabum menſuram ſcelerum ſuorum implere,</hi> God would have <hi>Ahab</hi> fill up the meaſure of his ſinne, that he might be condignely puniſhed. And why may we not ſay as well, that God would have Tiberius to fill up the meaſure of his ſinnes?

Yet Arminius in reference to theſe very courſes, ſpares not to profeſſe, that God would have Ahab to fill up the meaſure of his ſinnes, yet doth not <hi>Bertius</hi> upbraid him for defaming God, with imputing cruelty unto him.

And if it may be truely and piouſly ſaid, that in theſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious uſages of the Son of God, they went as farre as God would have them to goe; why may it not, with as great truth and piety be avouched, that Tiberius alſo in theſe his barbarous courſes, went as farre as God would have him? Neither doth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius give himſelfe to qualify the harſhneſſe of theſe his affirmations. We ſay that whatſoever comes to paſſe, it is Gods will it ſhould come to paſſe, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſeth, <hi>Enchir. cap.</hi> 95. <hi>Nec aliquid fit niſi Omnipotens fieri velit,</hi> and the Articles of Ireland, Artic. 11. profeſſe the ſame.

uttermoſt of his power in this particular, being convicted in conſcience by the evidence of truth is driven to confeſſe; <hi>Bonum eſſe ut malum fiat Deo permittente,</hi> It is good that evill ſhould come to paſſe by Gods permiſſion, or Gods permitting it. Tiberius willed that the Virgins ſhould be defloured and impiouſly he willed it. God willed that Davids Concubines ſhould be defloured, and holily he willed it; neither is he delighted with impurity. For the Scripture attributes this unto God, <hi>I will give thy Wives unto thy Neighbour, and he ſhall lye with them in the ſight of all Iſrael and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſunne.</hi> And this conſtupration of Davids Concubines ſerved for the chaſtiſing of David, as Arminius profeſſeth, <hi>Inſerviit caſtigando Davidi; &amp; omnes paenae habent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um authorem,</hi> All puniſhments have God for their author; they are the words of the ſame Arminius. It was impiety and cruelty in Tiberius to cauſe the Virgins to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floured and ſtrangled But what Chriſtian dares to impute impiety or cruelty unto God for cauſing the Children of the Sodomites, ſome in their Mothers wombe, ſome hanging upon their Mothers breaſts, to be conſumed with fire and brimſtone. It was impiety and cruelty in Tiberius, to will the deflouring of thoſe Virgins, that they might be ſtrangled. But Arminius thought it neither impiety nor cruelty for God to will, that Ahab ſhould fill up the meaſure of his ſinne, that ſo he might accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late unto himſelfe wrath in the day of wrath; for if he had I preſume, he would not have aſcribed any ſuch will unto God, as he doth in expreſſe termes. Although he well knew the vaſt difference between the power of man, and the power of God in executing vengeance; the ones power extending only to the execution of vengeance temporall, but Gods power extends to the execution of vengeance eternall. Now I find a ſtory immediatly following this very ſtory alleadged by this Author out of <hi>Suetonius</hi> expreſſing the cruelty of Tiberius in a farther degree, as not contented with the death of them whom he would deſtroy, and therefore he would keep them alive to torment them: <hi>Mori volentibus vis adhibita vivendi,</hi> when they deſired to dye, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to live by force; <hi>Nam mortem adeò leve ſupplicium putabat ut cum audiſſet unum è reis anticipaſſe eam, exclamaverit Carnutius me evaſit,</hi> For he accounted death ſo light a puniſhment that when he heard one of the condemned perſons to have anticipated it, he cryed out <hi>Carnutius</hi> hath eſcaped me; for that was the condemned perſons name. <hi>And when he took notice of them that were inward, when one deſired to ſuffer betimes, he anſwered him, Nondum tecum in gratiam redii.</hi> I doe not as yet beare theſe ſo much good will. Now, why may not ſome Atheiſticall perſon track the ſteps of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and in this particular exaggerate the hainouſneſſe of Gods holy courſes as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring of cruelty beyond all example, beyond the cruelty of Tiberius, becauſe he holds delinquent creatures upon the rack of eternall torment in hell fire? For certain vindicative courſes in Tiberius inferior unto theſe are accounted abominable, cruell, and impious; how much more (if this Authors argumentation be of force) thoſe courſes which the word of God hath informed us to be the courſes divine, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beyond the courſes of Tiberius in the way of ſeverity and rigour? As for the power of God in producing ſinne, we acknowledge none. Above 1200 years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe it was delivered by <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that <hi>ſinne hath no efficient cauſe, but deficient only.</hi> But when the creature ſinneth, he ſinneth in doing that he ought not to doe; or in doing what he doth, not in that manner he ought to doe; or in not doing what he ought to doe, or not in what manner he ought to doe it; not one of all which is incident unto God. All efficiency both divine and humane is found only about the act ſubſtrate unto ſinne; and all ſides now a daies acknowledge, that God is the author thereof as well as man by an effective concourſe, though difference there is about the manner of the concourſe: and particularly theſe; Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us will have Gods concourſe to an evill act, to be every way as much as his concourſe to a good, and that he concurres to the working of a good act, no more then to the working of an evill act. Which we utterly deny, requiring a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble concourſe to every good act that is not ſupernaturall, as touching the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the act; One to the producing of the ſubſtance of the act, another to the producing the goodneſſe thereof, that is, the gracious manner of performing it: For even a naturall man may abſtaine from lying, ſtealing, whoring, blaſpheam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but no naturall man can abſtaine from theſe in a gracious manner, that is, out of the love of God and that ſuch a love as is, <hi>Amor Dei uſ<expan>

Secondly, as touching the matter of divine concourſe, to the ſubſtance of any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall act. We ſay God moves the will to the doing of it, as it becomes the firſt cauſe to move the ſecond, but how? agreeable to the nature of it, that is, like as he moves naturall agents to doe that which they doe, neceſſarily; ſo he moves all rationall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents to doe that which they doe, contingently and freely.

Yet Blaſphemy is uſually imputed unto them without all feare or wit; not conſidering, that herein they impute blaſphemy to the language of the Holy Ghoſt. As for example.</p>
                              <p>What an horrible ſinne is it for Kings and Princes to imploy their power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, not for the ſupporting of the Kingdome of Chriſt, <hi>by whom Kings reigne,</hi> but for the ſupporting and eſtabliſhing of the kingdome of Antichriſt, as in the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Gods Saints, delivered over to the ſecular power, to that end, and that by cenſures Eccleſiaſticall? Now if we ſhould ſay that it is God that works thus in the hearts of Kings, thus to imploy their power for the ſupporting of Antichriſt, we ſhould be cenſured for blaſphemers. Yet the Holy Ghoſt ſpares not to profeſſe, that <hi>God hath put into their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree and give their Kingdome to the Beaſt, untill the words of God be fulfilled.</hi>

                              <p>In like ſort, from the firſt Preaching of the Goſpell unto this day, many there have been, and at this day are, who are diſobedient unto it, and ſtumble at it either in the whole or in part. If we ſhould ſay that they who thus diſobey, and ſtumble at the word of God, are ordained thereunto, ſuch as this Author and his Complices, are ready to cry out upon us as Blaſpheamers, and to profeſſe that they will rather deny that there is a God, then hold with the <hi>Contra-Remonſtrants.</hi> Yet S. <hi>Peter</hi> budgeth not <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 8.</note> to profeſſe, that <hi>Chriſt is a ſtone of ſtumbling and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word of God, being diſobedient, whereunto alſo they were ordained.</hi>

It is only a culpable defect that makes one the author of ſinne; that is, when he failes of doing that which he ought to doe.

                              <p>THis Motive, as this Author calleth it, hath the firſt place in the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> reaſon of Arminius; whereby he laboureth to diſprove their opinion, who conceive the object of Predeſtination to be the Maſſe of mankind not created; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in the declaration of his opinion made before the States of Holland, &amp;c. and it is the firſt particular of ſix, mentioned in that ſixteenth reaſon of his. And why ſhould he divide it from the reſt, and not clap them together, into this ranke of motives, to prepare him to the renouncing of that Tenent, which here he impugneth, and adde Arminius his other ninteen reaſons hereunto to the ſame purpoſe; if himſelfe be privy to the cauſe thereof, I am not? But as it lieth I will conſider it. Now it proceedeth upon ſuppoſition, that ſuch a neceſſity of ſinning is brought upon man by this decree, as ſtands in oppoſition unto liberty. Whereunto I anſwere.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. That this decree in reference to the act of denying grace, brings no neceſſity at all of ſinning upon man; it being only the divine decree of not cureing by the grace of regeneration (that is by the grace of faith and repentance) that naturall infidelity and impenitency wherein every man is borne; all men being <hi>conjecti in neceſſitatem pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candi,</hi> through the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> as <hi>Corvinus</hi> confeſſeth, they being his own words. Now let every ſober man judge, whether to leave that infidelity and impenitency which God findes in a man uncured, be to bring a neceſſity of ſinning upon him.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. Secondly, we anſwer, that notwithſtanding <hi>that neceſſity of ſinning</hi> whereupon all are caſt, as <hi>Cornivus</hi> ſpeaketh, yet there is no ſinne committed by a naturall and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man, which is not committed by him freely: The act of lying, the act of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheaming, the act of whoring, the act of drunkenneſſe, gluttony, rayling, and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, every ſinfull act being freely committed, by every one by whom it is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as is apparent by this, that there is not one of theſe ſinfull acts, but is forborne by divers naturall and carnall men, and therein they doe abſtaine from the committing of it freely. And yet we ſay, that even in abſtaining from theſe acts, they doe not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from ſinne, for as much as they doe not abſtaine from them in a gracious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and all by reaſon of that originall corruption which remaines uncured in them, untill ſuch time as God, who hath mercy on whom he will, is pleaſed to cure it by the grace of regeneration.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. But becauſe I imagine this Author lets fly at randome, and keeps not himſelfe to the preciſe genius of the Tenent by him impugned, but rather aimeth at our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning providence divine, and the decree of God; according whereunto we willing profeſſe with <hi>Auſtin</hi> that, <hi>Non aliquid fit niſi Omnipotens fieri velit, Enchir.</hi> 95. Therefore I anſwere in the third Place, That the neceſſity following upon this will of God, is nothing prejudiciall to the liberty or contingency of ſecond agents in their ſeverall operations. Although I am not ignorant, that now a daies it is the common and glorious courſe of our Adverſaries, very confidently to preſume and preſuppoſe, that upon the will of God, paſſing upon the action of the creature, there followeth a neceſſity, ſtanding in flat oppoſition to the liberty of rationall agents; and no marvail, for <hi>ſic factitavit Hercules,</hi> Arminius the great Champion of their cauſe, his learning
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56120:21"/>
ſerved him to doe ſo before them. As if the contumelious uſages of our Saviour by Herod and Pontius Pilate, together with the Gentiles and people of Iſrael, were not performed freely, but by meer neceſſity oppoſite to liberty. For it cannot be denied, but that all theſe were gathered together againſt the holy ſonne of God, to doe what Gods hand and Gods counſel had predeſtinated to be done. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 28. And in like ſort, they that through diſobedience ſtumbled at the word of God, did not freely diſobey the Word, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> profeſſeth of them in expreſſe termes, that Hereunto they were ordained. And after the ſame manner it is to be conceived of the Kings, that gave their Kingdomes to the Beaſt, namely that they did it not freely in as much as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, that God <hi>put into their hearts to fulfill his will, and to conſent and give their Kingdome to the Beaſt.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Yet the Church of Ireland in their Articles ſet forth by as good Authority, as the Articles of the Church of England, Art. 11. having profeſſed that, <hi>God from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, did by his unchangeable counſel ordaine whatſoever in time ſhould come to paſſe;</hi> to prevent ſuch like objections as this Author faſhioneth, forthwith adde, <hi>Yet ſo as thereby no violence is offered to the willes of reaſonable creatures, and neither the liberty nor the contingency of ſecond cauſes is taken away, but eſtabliſhed rather.</hi> And <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his Book <hi>De Grat. &amp; Liber. Arbitr.</hi> where he ſpeaks as freely of Gods effectuall Providence working in evill, as no where more, in ſo much as our Adverſaries take great exceptions againſt his ſpeeches (ſuch as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly delivered) and that in expreſſe termes: His main drift notwithſtanding, and ſcope in that Book is to prove, that notwithſtanding the divine operation, in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motion of the creature as he thinks good, yet is the creature never a whit the leſſe free in its own operation. And indeed where grace is wanting, there is too much will rather then too little, unto that which is evill; according to that he writes alſo elſewhere, <hi>Libertas ſine gratia non eſt libertas ſed contumacia.</hi> And if Gods operation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiceth not the liberty of the creature, much leſſe the will of God. For though not <note place="margin">Epiſt. 28.</note> any thing comes to paſſe unleſſe God willeth it, whether it be good or evill, yet with this difference as <hi>Auſtin</hi> in the ſame place profeſſeth, <hi>He will have that which is good come</hi>

                                 <hi>to paſſe by the effecting of it, but evill only by his permitting of it. Non aliquid fit niſi Omnipotens fieri velit, vel ſinendo ut fiat vel ipſe faciendo.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But though <hi>Auſtin</hi> and the Church of Ireland, yea and the Word of God teacheth this; yet the Tragaedian, as this Author ſaith, could ſee the contrary, that is, perceive the evidence of the contrary, which none of theſe ſaw. And is not this a pretty Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maedy, that a Tragaedian and <hi>Zeno's</hi> ſervant muſt be brought in, and that in a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiary ſuppoſition to out face, not Divines only both antient and late, but the very word of God? For it is as clear forſooth, that what comes to paſſe by the will of God, and by the effectuall operation of God, doth not come to paſſe freely; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that the doctrine (which maintaines that evill comes to paſſe by the will of God, as the crucifying of Chriſt by the predeſtination of God, or by the operation of God; as the Rent of the ten Tribes from the two, and the hardning of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> heart, ſo as not to let Iſrael goe, God profeſſeth to be his work) takes away all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſinne? All this I ſay is as cleare (if we believe this Author) as that <hi>Seneca's</hi> Tragaedies are the Oracles of God. And I pray conſider, muſt it not take away as well all conſcience of righteouſneſſe, whether of faith, or of repentance, or of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; unleſſe we deny faith to be the gift of God, repentance to be the gift of God; unles we deny that God is he, <hi>Who makes us perfect to every good work, working in us that which is pleaſing in his ſight,</hi> that God is he that putteth his own ſpirit in us, and <hi>cauſeth</hi>

                              <p>Yet what doth <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeak of the divine will, or divine operation? Did the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaedian under the terme of Fate, denote the divine decree, or the divine adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things, which is plentifully revealed to us in the word of God? <hi>Auſtin</hi> I am ſure thought otherwiſe in more places then one, in Pſalm. 31. on theſe words, <hi>Pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciabo adverſum me,</hi> He blames thoſe who when they are found in their ſinnes ſay, <hi>Fatum mihi fecit, ſtellae meae fecêrunt,</hi> But ſaith he, <hi>Quid eſt fatum? Quae ſunt ſtellae? certè iſtae quas in Coelo conſpicimus; &amp; Qui eas fecit? Deus. Quis eas ordinavit? Deus, ergo vides quod voluiſti dicere, Deus fecit ut peccarem:</hi> Then he tells of others, who ſaid that <hi>Mars facit Homici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, Venus Adulterum.</hi> So that <hi>Fatum</hi> with them were ſecond cauſes, which we all know in their operations, doe both work by neceſſity of nature, and have no power to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the free will of man; and in Pſalm. 91. <hi>Quaeris ab illo quid ſit Fatum, &amp; dicit ſtellae ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae. Quaeris ab illo, quis fecit ſtellas, quis ordinavit ſtellas; non habet quid tibi reſpondeat niſi Deus.</hi>
                                 <pb n="30" facs="tcp:56120:22"/>
It's true indeed, the Pelagians did object the Stoicall Fate unto <hi>Auſtin,</hi> as if his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine favoured of it; and what doth he anſwer thereunto? <hi>Nec ſub nomine gratiae Fatum aſſerimus, quia nullis hominum meritis dicimus Dei gratiam antecedi.

                              <p>But as I ſaid before, whatſoever they conceived of Fate, and howſoever they faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, their opinion thereof did not expectorate all conſcience of ſinne in them, or urge them to juſtify or excuſe themſelves in their courſes. For it appears both of <hi>Oaedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> and <hi>Iocaſta,</hi> that they not only condemned themſelves, but became ſelfe executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of puniſhment upon themſelves for their foule crimes: the one pulling out his own eyes, judging himſelfe unworthy to ſee the light; and the other deſtroying her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Though whatſoever they or the Poets that ſet them forth conceived of Fate, in this caſe of theirs, it was only the Oracles of the Devills, and his illuſions that abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them; God giving them over thereunto, and that no doubt moſt juſtly; when in a wicked curioſity they deſire to know, what ſhall become of them and their children: the Devill gives forth his Oracles as he thinks good, afterwards ſets his witts on work to accompliſh them thereby, to gain the greater credit and reputation to himſelfe, and ſo much the more forcibly holds them in his ſnares.</p>
                              <p>But to proceed. This argument or motive is not yet at an end, but like as this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, is pretended to take away all conſcience of ſinne, which is as much as to ſay, all deſert of ſinne on the one ſide; ſo it may be extended to ſhew, how it takes away all conſcience of obedience, and all deſert thereupon, on the other ſide; to wit, in good actions. And indeed were it true, that the doctrine did bereave a man of all free will, it were true, as <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith, that where ſuch neceſſity is, <hi>nec damnatio, nec Corona eſt</hi> But <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath ſpent an whole Book in proofe of this, namely; that grace conſiſts with freedome of will, unto that which is good; and want of grace together with God's efficacious operation, even in the worſt of things, doth conſiſt alſo with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56120:22"/>
of will unto that which is evill. But that in the ſtate of nature man hath no free will to that which is good, but is a ſervant unto ſin, I know no man that doth or can deny, unleſſe withall he deny Originall ſinne with the Pelagians; like as indeed it is written of <hi>Grevincovius</hi> that great Arminian, <hi>that, Grevincovius negavit peccatum Originale, quod &amp; teſtibus convinci poteſt.</hi> And indeed this Authors diſcourſe bears ſtrongly this way, whatſoever Proteſtation in ſhew of words he makes hereafter to the contrary. For it is apparent, that in this place, the face of his diſcourſe ſtands for freedome of will in all, as well unto that which is good, as unto that which is evill. And albeit there is ſo little difference between this and his former motive (touching the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſinne) that it ſeems to be added only to make way for this ſentence of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, which yet is nothing to the purpoſe, unleſſe he can prove, that Gods decrees doe bereave men of liberty of their wills: yet very unhappily doth he carry himſelf herein and in farre different manner from Hierom's expreſſion, though he placeth <hi>Corona</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>damnation;</hi> one whereof, to wit, damnation, implies the merit of ſinne preceding: but the other, to wit, <hi>Corona,</hi> no way implies any meritorious nature of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience precedanious thereunto. But this Author ſticks not to apply a meritorious condition to good actions on the one ſide, as well as to evill actions on the other. And if good actions were as meritorious, and that naturally too, of the crown of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, as evill actions are of damnation. And withall he will have no more to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, or work the faith, and repentance, and obedience of one, then he doth the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, and impenitency, and diſobedience of another, leaſt this his will &amp; operation, prove an adamantine chaine, of neceſſity to draw them to faith, and repentance, and obedience, whereas his wiſdome thinks it fit, they ſhould be left to their own choyce, whetherthey will believe and repent, yea or no. For he doth very conſidently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that every man hath power to believe and repent, and doe any good work; which is as good, as in expreſſe termes to profeſſe, that there is no originall ſinne at all; Notwithſtanding ſo many expreſſe teſtimonies of holy writ to the contrary, namely, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. of ſome that, <hi>They could not believe.</hi> Rom. 2. of others that, <hi>They could not repent.</hi> Rom. 8. of all that are in the fleſh, that, <hi>They cannot pleaſe God.</hi> 1 Cor. 2. of the natural man that, He <hi>neither perceives the things of God nor can know them;</hi> of the Iſraelites in the Wilderneſſe, that, God <hi>had not given them an heart to perceive, nor eyes to ſee, nor eares to heare unto that day.</hi> Deutr. 29. 4. But theſe paſſages of holy Scripture, ſeem to have no place in this Authors conſideration, if ſo be they have in his Creed. This bed is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too ſhort for him to ſtretch himſelfe thereon; and therefore he deſires to change his lodging, and to paſſe from the deſert of good actions, to the deſert of evill actions, which he formerly inſiſted upon, and he tells a ſtory of <hi>Zeno's</hi> ſervant moſt ſuitable to his Iambick taken out of <hi>Seneca,</hi> though he quotes the place of neither.</p>
                              <p>Well, <hi>Zeno's ſervant,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>when he was puniſhed by his Maſter for a fault that he had done, told his Maſter out of his own grounds, that he was unjuſtly beaten, becauſe he was, Fato coactus peccare:</hi> and hereupon making his reckoning without his hoſte, concludes that, <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if Malefactors could not chuſe but play their rude prankes, they could not be juſtly puniſhed for them:</hi> Wherein he tells us what the ſervant ſaid; but what the Maſter anſwered, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ſaith juſt nothing.

                           <p n="2">2. That the finall impenitency and damnation of reprobates, are neceſſary and unavoidable by Gods abſolute decree.</p>
                           <p>Theſe two things are the <hi>maxima gravamina</hi> that the other ſide ſtick at. So that theſe two paths meet at laſt in the ſame way. But becauſe this laſt is choſen by the moſt, and lateſt maintainers of the abſolute decree, as the more moderate of the two, and the eaſyer to be defended, I will ſet down the concluſion which I diſlike in their way and words.</p>
                           <p>God hath abſolutely purpoſed from eternity, of his meer will and pleaſure without any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of actuall continuance in ſinne and unbeliefe, utterly to caſt off from grace and glory, Millions of men conſidered in the fall (even thoſe whom he calls to repentance and ſolvation by the Preaching of the Goſpell) for the manifeſtation of his ſeverity and Juſtice.</p>
                           <p>That all mankind is involved in the firſt ſinne and the fruits thereof, which are corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the guilt of eternall death, I confidently believe.

                           <p>Having thus plainly laid down the poſition, which I deem to be falſe, I come now in the next place to deliver my reaſons againſt it, which are of two ſorts:</p>

                              <p>HEre breaks out the main reaſon, that moved this Author to repreſent the different opinions of our Divines about the object of Predeſtination, that ſo a way might be opened unto him at pleaſure, to charge the former opinion with what he thought good; and as for the proofe of his criminations, he might the better eaſe himſelfe of the burthen thereof, by ſhewing the diſſent of other Devines of the ſame profeſſion from the former in this particular, making choyce rather to ſhape the object of Predeſtination and reprobation, under the notion of mankind, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the maſſe corrupt by the fall of Adam. For ſurely it is to be preſuppoſed, that they did not diſſent from their former friends without ſome reaſon, and this Author makes bold to inſinuate, that theſe abſurdities mentioned by him were the reaſons: As when he ſaith, <hi>Theſe abſurdities following too evidently from the upper way; Others of the ſame ſide willing to decline them, as rocks and precipices doe leave that way.</hi> But that theſe were the motives whereby they were induced to decline the former opinion, and to embrace the latter, he proves not, nor ſo much as adventureth upon the proofe thereof, but leaves unto his credulous reader to ſupply that by his forwardneſſe, to take it upon truſt; as if this diſcourſer by his morall carriage, might winne the opinion of ſo much worthineſſe, as to be a man with whom you may well play at Put-finger in the darke, <hi>quicum in tenebris mices.</hi> And yet Arminius might have taught him, that there is a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle opinion between theſe; namely, of thoſe who make the object of predeſtination the maſſe of mankind created, but not yet corrupted. And he puts this opinion upon <hi>Junius,</hi> and appeals to his <hi>Theſes,</hi> as giving evident teſtimony thereunto. Now there is no ſhew or colour of reaſon, why, to avoyd the abſurdities premiſed by this Author, any man ſhould decline the firſt way, and embrace the ſecond, which is the way of <hi>Junius.</hi> And this I conceive to be the main reaſon, why this ſecond way is altogether diſſembled by this Author, or by the ſpirit that guided him. For albeit it was for this advantage (who hankes after every ſorry conſideration to ſerve his turne in the way of motive, learning to repreſent the multiplicity of opinions hereabouts amongſt our Divines:) yet it being a matter of greater moment, to gain the juſtification of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities charged upon the firſt way, from the mouthes or practice of our Divines, at leaſt in appearance: and ſome colour hereof he findes by declining the firſt way and falling upon the third; but no colour at all by declining the firſt way and falling upon the ſecond. Therefore he thought it a part of his wiſdome altogether to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſecond, and to repreſent the opinion of thoſe Divines who decline the firſt (yea and ſecond too) and fall upon the third. But ſuppoſe <hi>Iunius</hi> had preferred the third way and not the ſecond, Had he done it out of a deſire to decline the abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties here mentioned? It is apparent by that his conference with Arminius (which yet he ſet not forth, but the Arminian party after his death) that he maintaines all theſe conſiderations to have their place in Predeſtination, and therefore makes <hi>Hominem communiter conſideratum</hi> the object of predeſtination, which as it is a notion abſtract from all the three ſpeciall notions of <hi>nondum conditum,</hi> or <hi>conditum,</hi> but <hi>nondum corruptum,</hi> or <hi>deni<expan>

And indeed <hi>Piſcator</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves the queſtion about the object of Predeſtination, namely, that as Predeſtination includes the decree of creating men unto different ends, ſo the object muſt neceſſarily be mankind <hi>not yet created;</hi> as it includes the decree of permitting all to fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo the object (as he thinkes) muſt be mankind <hi>created, but not yet corrupted;</hi> and laſtly as it includes the decree of chuſing ſome out of that corrupt maſſe, and refuſing others or leaving them in it. ſo the object of his judgement muſt be mankind <hi>both created and corrupted.</hi> And Arminius himſelfe profeſſeth, that the twenty reaſons wherewith he diſputeth againſt the firſt way, may alſo be accommodated againſt the other waies. And albeit the followers of the ſecond and third way doe think that they can better maintain their Tenent, and free it from the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56120:24"/>
abſurdities wherewith the other waies are charged; yet it followeth not herehence, that therefore they did juſtify them, the contrary whereunto appears in the particular of <hi>Iunius,</hi> as before I mentioned. <hi>Moulin</hi> indeed diſputes againſt the firſt, but doth he, to decline that, ſubſiſt in the third, as touching the making of the corrupt Maſſe the object of reprobation? it is apparent he doth not. But as reprobation denotes Gods decree of damnation, he premiſeth thereunto, the foreſight of finall impenitency. Of this opinion of his, this Author takes no notice. Yet is <hi>Moulin</hi> ſound throughout in the doctrine of election; wherein if this Author did concurre with him, we ſhould no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing trouble our ſelves to take him off from his concurrence with <hi>Moulin</hi> in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of reprobation. And wee of the firſt way are willing to profeſſe, that God neither damnes nor decrees to damne any man, but for ſinne and finall perſeverance therein; nor ſo only, but in plain termes to pronounce, that in no moment of nature doth Gods intention of damnation precede the conſideration of ſinne, and final im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency; though we doe not make the conſideration of ſinne to precede the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of damnation, as <hi>Moulin</hi> doth. And to my underſtanding, other reaſons there are, which caſt Divines upon the third way, then the declining of theſe abſurdities men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by this Author; as namely, that the very notions of election and reprobation, the one being conceived to be an act of mercy, the other an act of juſtice, doe preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſinne. And whereas <hi>Arminius</hi> in his conference with <hi>Iunius,</hi> produceth five rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt the firſt way, no leſſe then foure of them proceed on this manner; The firſt thus, <hi>Praedeſtinatio eſt voluntas Dei de illuſtrandâ ſuâ gloriâ per miſericordia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; juſtitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: At illa vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas locum non habet in nondum condito ceu condendo.</hi> The third thus, <hi>Praedeſtinatio eſt pars provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiae adminiſtrantis &amp; guberna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tis humanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> genus; ergò poſterior naturâ actu creationis vel propoſito creandi.

Grat. Dei. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>De Praedeſtin. digreſſ.</hi> 5. in ſeverall chapters. Only the ſecond argument of <hi>Arminius</hi> inſiſteth upon Gods ordination of mans fall. And to be freed from the trouble of anſwering this argument, is the only thing that I know we gain, by leaving the firſt and ſecond way, and embarking our ſelves in the third. But how freed? ſurely only ſo farre, as that the doctrine of election and reprobation, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Adams</hi> fall, doth not engage us to inquire into divine providence concerning <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> fall. But nevertheleſſe it cannot be denied, but that had not God permitted <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> to fall, he had never fallen. And we that take the firſt way, acknowledge no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Providence divine concerning the ingreſſe of ſinne, as ſinne, into the world, but in the way of permiſſion. Sinne as ſinne admitting no cauſe efficient, but deficient on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And it is utterly impoſſible, that God, either in doing what he doth, or in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to doe what he doth not, ſhould in any culpable, or juſtly blameable manner be deficient. And if it be farther demanded, whether upon Gods permiſſion it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <note place="margin">

And this alſo <hi>Nava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rettus</hi> a Papiſt profeſſeth, and though he be a Dominican, yet I know no Jeſuite that oppoſeth him in this. And if any man inferre herehence, that then God determining to permit ſinne, did determine that ſinne ſhould enter into the World.

And Arminius is expreſſe in ſaying, <hi>Voluit Deus Achabum menſuram ſcelerum implere.</hi> And what is this but, <hi>Peccata peccatis cumulare?</hi> And though the Jeſuits and Arminians doe <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Exam. p.</hi> 162.</note> with all their force reſiſt, yet it evidently followes from the notion of efficacious grace embraced by the one, and by the notion of an efficacious impediment of ſinne, dictated by Arminius himſelfe. For efficacious grace with the Jeſuites, conſiſts in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56120:24"/>
congruity thereof, and the congruity thereof conſiſts in this, that God foreſeeth that upon the confeſſion thereof ſinne will be avoided. Now what is the reaſon why God grants ſuch a grace, whereupon he ſeeth ſin will not be avoided; and denies ſuch a grace, upon the granting whereof, he knowes full well that ſinne would be avoided; but becauſe his pleaſure is, that ſinne ſhall be committed by his permiſſion, and not be avoyded, although he hath given them grace ſufficient to avoid it, as they ſay, and it was moſt true of <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocency. In like ſort doth Arminius diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of, <hi>Peceati impedimentum ſufficiens &amp; efficax,</hi> Efficacious hinderance of ſinne, is that whereby God ſeeth ſinne will be avoided; ſufficient is only that whereby a man may avoid it if he will. But withall he confeſſeth, that God in the Promptuary of his wiſdome, hath not only ſuch impediments as are ſufficient to the avoiding of any ſinne, but ſuch alſo, as whereby any ſinne would indeed be avoided, were he pleaſed <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Armin. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am. p.</hi> 157.</note> to grant them. But yet as often as he thinks good to permit ſinne, he doth not grant ſuch impediments. And is not this a manifeſt evidence, that it is Gods will, that ſinne ſhall come to paſſe (to wit, as often as it doth come to paſſe) by his permiſſion? But ſuppoſe all our Divines that embrace the third way, doe imagine the abſurdities here ſpoken of, to be juſtly chargeable upon the firſt way. Yet as he thinks them in an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, while they conceive they can with eaſe avoid theſe abſurdities by their third way, let him be pleaſed to conceive, they may as well be in an errour, in thinking them juſtly chargeable upon the firſt way; and conſequently their opinion is nothing ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to juſtify, that they are unremoveable by them that embrace the firſt way.</p>
                              <p>It is true there is no cauſe of breach either of Unity or Amity between our Divines upon this difference, as I ſhewed in my digreſſions <hi>De Praedeſtinatione Digreſſ.</hi> 1. ſeeing neither of them derogate either from the prerogative of Gods grace, or of his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over his creatures, to give grace to whom he will, and to deny it to whom he will, and conſequently, to make whom he will veſſels of mercy, and whom he will veſſells of wrath; but equally they ſtand for the divine prerogative in each. And as for the ordering of Gods decrees of creation, permiſſion of the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> giving grace of faith and repentance unto ſome, and denying it to others, and finally ſaving ſome and damning others, whereupon only ariſe the different opinions, as touching the object of predeſtination and reprobation, it is meerly <hi>Apex Logicus,</hi> a poynt of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick. And were it not a meer madneſſe, to make a breach of unity or charity in the Church of God, meerely upon a poynt of Logick? Thus have I juſtified the improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and utter unlikelihood, that ever any ſchiſme will be made in the Church of God, upon theſe nice and meer Logicall differences, in my <hi>Vindic. Grat. Dei,</hi> which this Author is acquainted with as appears by a paſſage that hereafter he repreſenteth therehence, and that farther into the Book then theſe my digreſſions are upon the point of predeſtination, but is content to take no notice thereof, leaſt it might hinder the courſe of his Scene, whereunto it is fit he ſhould be ſerviceable. And as for the two Articles here mentioned, wherein they are ſaid unanimouſly to agree, and which he calls <hi>maxima gravamina.</hi> It is true they doe agree herein, but it may be in a farre other ſenſe, then he is willing ſhould be taken notice of. For as for the firſt,</p>
                              <p n="1">1. <hi>That the moving cauſe of reprobation, is the alone will of God, and not the ſinne of man ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall or actuall.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="1">1. This is true in proportion to election, that like as no good work of man is the moving cauſe of election, but only the will of God; ſo no ſinne or evill work of man is the cauſe of reprobation, but only the will of God.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. That ſo it is of election, the Apoſtle both</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Saith, <hi>Election is not of Workes but of him that calleth.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="2">2. And proveth thus, <hi>Before Eſau and Iacob were borne, or had done good or evill, it was ſaid, The Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger; therefore Election is not of Workes (that is of good workes) but of him that calleth.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="2">2. That ſo it is of reprobation, I prove by the ſame argument of the Apoſtle, thus, <hi>Before Eſau and Iacob were borne, or had done good or evill, it was ſaid the Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger; therefore reprobation ſtands not of workes</hi> (that is of evill workes) <hi>but of the meer pleaſure of God.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="1">1. And like as this is farther evident by Gods courſe of calling in the point of Election, as the Apoſtle intimateth, for as much as God calleth effectually whom he will in beſtowing faith and repentance upon
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56120:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them. For as the Apoſtle afterwards profeſſeth, <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="2">2. So it is as evident in the point of reprobation, in as much as God refuſeth to call whom he will, by denying faith and repentance unto them, as afterwards the ſame Apoſtle profeſſeth, ſaying, that God hardneth whom he will.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. And this doctrine we doe explicate by diſtinguiſhing that which our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries deſire to confound, leaſt their cheating carriage ſhould be diſcovered, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I have ſhewed.</p>
                              <p>For Predeſtination and Reprobation, may be conſidered either <hi>quoad Praedeſtinantis &amp; Reprobantis actum;</hi> or <hi>quoad Praedeſtinationis &amp; Reprobationis terminum,</hi> as much as to ſay, <hi>quoad res praedeſtinatione &amp; reprobatione praeparatas,</hi> that is, either as touching the act of Predeſtination and Reprobation, or as touching <hi>the things decreed by Predeſtination or Reprobation.</hi> Now as touching the act of Predeſtination never any man (ſaith <hi>Aquinas) was ſo mad as to ſay that the merits of man are the cauſe of predeſtination.</hi> And why ſo? Becauſe the act of predeſtination is the act of Gods will, and formerly (ſaith he) I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>that there can be no cauſe of the will of God, as touching the act of God willing, but only as touching the things willed by God.</hi> Now apply this to reprobation. For is not reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as touching the act of God reprobating, the very act alſo of Gods will? This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied: and herehence it followes, that like as there can be no cauſe of Gods will, as touching the act of God willing, ſo there can be no cauſe of reprobation, as touching the act of God reprobating. And like as it was a mad thing in <hi>Aquinas</hi> his judgement to ſay, that merits were the cauſe of predeſtination, as touching the act of God predeſtinating; ſo it is no leſſe madneſſe in his judgement, to maintain that either ſinne originall or actuall, can be the meritorious cauſe of reprobation, as touching the act of God reprobating.</p>
                              <p>And what are the reaſons hereof in School-divinity? Why ſurely theſe. 1. Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination and Reprobation are eternall, but good workes and evill workes of the creature are temporall; but impoſſible it is, that a thing temporall, can be the cauſe of that which is eternall. 2. The act of Predeſtination and Reprobation is the act of Gods will, and the act of Gods will, like as the act of his knowledge, is the very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God even God himſelfe; and therefore to introduce a cauſe of Gods will, is to bring in a cauſe of God himſelfe. 3. If works or faith foreſeen be any moving cauſe of Divine election, then either they are ſo of their own nature, or by the meer conſtitution of God. Not of their own nature, as it is apparent; therefore by the conſtitution of God: but this cannot ſtand neither. For if by the conſtitution of God, then it would follow, that God did conſtitute, that upon foreſight of mans faith he would elect him, that is, ordaine him to ſalvation. And what I pray is to conſtitute? Is it any other then to ordaine? And herehence it followeth, God did ordaine that upon foreſight of mans faith, he would ordaine him unto ſalvation: Whereby the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ordination of God, is made the object of his eternall ordination; whereas it is well known, and generally received, that nothing, but that which is temporall, can be the object of divine ordination which is eternall. In like ſort I diſpute of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation: if ſinne be the cauſe thereof, then either of its own nature it is the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or by the ordinance of God: Not of its own nature as all are ready to confeſſe: if you ſay by the ordinance of God, then it follows God did ordaine, that upon the foreſight of mans ſinne, he would ordaine him unto damnation. For reprobation is Gods ordaining a man unto damnation, as touching one part of the things decreed thereby; which we come to conſider in the next place, and that both in election and in reprobation, having hitherto conſidered them as touching the act of God electing or reprobating, and ſhewed that thus they can have no cauſe.</p>
                              <p>But as touching the things decreed, thereby they may have a cauſe as <hi>Aquinas</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth and we profeſſe with him. As for example to begin with election.</p>
                              <p>The things decreed or deſtinated to a man in election are two, Grace and Glory. Now both theſe may have a cauſe: For both Grace is the cauſe of glory; and Chriſts merits are the cauſe both of grace and glory. But let grace be rightly underſtood. For in the confuſe notion of grace many are apt to lurke, thereby to ſhut their eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the evidence of truth. For no marvail if men be in love with their own er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; and in proportion to the love of errour, ſuch is their hatred of Divine truth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite thereunto. Now by grace, we underſtand the grace of regeneration, whereby
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56120:25"/>
that naturall corruption of mind and will (commonly called blindneſſe of mind and hardneſſe of heart) which we all bring into the world with us through originall ſin, is in part cured. More diſtinctly we call this grace, the grace of faith and repentance, whereby our naturall infidelity and impenitency is cured. Now this grace we ſay God beſtowes on whom he will, finding all equall in infidelity and impenitency. For ſo the Apoſtle tells us, that, <hi>God hath mercy on whom he will.</hi> And as God beſtowes it on <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 18.</note> whom he will, not finding any cauſe in man any way moving him, either in its own nature, or by divine conſtitution, moving him to beſtow this grace on any. So the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>God hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our workes, but according to his own purpoſe and grace.</hi> And indeed we being all found dead in ſinne, what could be found in one to move God to beſtow the life of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance upon him, more then upon another? And if any ſuch thing were found in man moving God hereunto, then ſhould grace be beſtowed according unto works, that is in the Fathers phraiſe (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknowledgeth) according unto merits; which was condemned 1200 years agoe, in the Synod of Paleſtine: and <hi>Pelagius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was driven to ſubſcribe unto it, otherwiſe they had condemned him alſo.</p>
                              <p>But as touching the conferring of glory, God doth not beſtow this on whom he will, finding men equall without any moving cauſe thereunto, even in man; For though there be no moving cauſe hereunto in man of its own nature, yet there is to be found, a moving cauſe in man by conſtitution divine, whereby God is as it were moved to beſtow ſolvation on ſome, and not on others. For God hath made a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſe, that whoſoever beleeveth and repenteth, and continueth in faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto death ſhall be ſaved, and whoſoever beleeveth not and repenteth not ſhall be damned. So then though men are equall in originall ſinne, and in naturall corruption, and God beſtowes faith and repentance on whom of them he will, curing their corruption in whom he will: yet when, he comes to the conferring of glory, men are not found equall in morall condition; and accordingly God cannot be ſaid on like manner, to beſtow glory &amp; ſolvation on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he will; For he hath tyed himſelfe by his own conſtitution to beſtow ſolvation on none, but ſuch as dye in theſtate of grace. Yet, I confes, ſome ſay that God beſtows ſolvation on whom he will, in as much as he is the author of their faith &amp; repentance, &amp; beſtows theſe graces on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he will, yet certainly there is a different manner in the uſe of this phraiſe of beſtowing this or that on whom he will. For when God beſtowes faith and repentance, he findes them on whom he will beſtow it, no better then others: But when he comes to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of glory he findes them, on whom he beſtowes that, farre better them others.</p>
                              <p>Now we come to the things decreed in reprobation, and theſe are two.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. The denyall of the grace of regeneration, that is, of the grace of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, whereby mans naturall infidelity and impenitency is cured.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. The denyall of glory, and the inflicting of damnation. The firſt of theſe, to wit, the denyall of grace mentioned, is made to whom he will. And it muſt needs be ſo, in eaſe God gives this grace to whom he will. And the Apoſtle profeſſeth, that as <hi>God hath mercy on whom he will, ſo he hardneth whom he will.</hi> And as God denies this grace to whom he will, ſo did he decree to deny it to whom he will: Yet there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence conſiderable: For albeit God hardneth whom he will, by denying unto them the grace of faith and repentance; yet notwithſtanding, like as it is juſt with God to inflict damnation upon them, for that ſinne whether originall or actuall, wherein he findes them, when the miniſtry of the word is afforded them: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it cannot be denied to be iuſt with God, to leave their infidelity and impenitency wherein he finds them uncured. But yet becauſe God hath not made any ſuch conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, namely, that whoſoever is found in infidelity and impenitency, ſhall be ſo left and abandoned by him: therefore he is properly ſaid, as to cure it in whom he will, ſo to leave it uncured in whom he will, finding them all equall in originall ſinne, and conſequently lying equally in this their naturall infidelity and impenitencv. So wee may iuſtly ſay, there is no cauſe at all in man of this difference, to wit, why God cures infidelity &amp; impenitency in one and not in another, but it is the meer pleaſure of God that is the cauſe of this difference. And if any liſt to contend hereabouts, we ſhall be willing to entertaine him, and conferre our ſtrength of argumentation on this point.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. But as touching the denyall of glory and inflicting of damnation, which is the ſecond thing decreed in reprobation, there is alwaies found a cauſe motive, yea and meritorious hereof, to wit, both of the denyall of the one &amp; inflicting of the other: And God doth not proceed herein according to the meer pleaſure of his will, &amp; that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56120:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by reaſon of his own conſtitution, having ordained that whoſoever continueth final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in infidelity, in profane courſes, and impenitency ſhall be damned. And albeit on the other ſide it may be ſaid in ſome ſence (as formerly I have ſhewed) that God ſaves whom he will, in as much as he is the author of faith, which he beſtowes on whom he will; yet in no congruous ſence can he be ſaid to damne whom he will, for as much as he is not the author of ſinne, as he is the author of faith. For every good thing he workes, but ſinne and the evill thereof he only permits, not cauſeth it. And laſtly, as God doth not damne whom he will, but thoſe only whom he finds fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to have perſevered in ſinne without repentance: ſo neither did he decree to damne, or reprobate to damnation whom he will, but only thoſe who ſhould be found finally to perſevere in ſinne without repentance.</p>
                              <p>Now let us apply this to the Article we have in hand, which is this; <hi>The moving cauſe of reprobation is the only will of God, and not the ſinne of man originall or actuall:</hi> and for the explication hereof, according to that which hath been formerly delivered, We ſay that reprobation doth ſignify, either a purpoſe of denying grace, as above mentioned, or a purpoſe of inflicting damnation. And each may be conſidered, either as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the act of Gods decree, or as touching the things decreed. We ſhew how the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle holds or holds not, being differently accommodated.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. As touching the things decreed,</p>
                              <p n="1">1. As touching the deniall of grace, We ſay, That God decreed of his meere good pleaſure to deny unto ſome the grace of faith and repentance, for the curing of that naturall infidelity and impenitency which is found in all, without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive cauſe hereunto found in one more then in another.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. As touching the inflicting of Damnation, We ſay, That God decreed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict damnation on ſome, not of his meer pleaſure, but meerly for their finall perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in ſinne without repentance.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. As touching the very act of Gods decree, We ſay, Nothing in man could be the cauſe hereof, but the meer pleaſure of God, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> profeſſeth it a mad thing to deviſe in man a cauſe of divine predeſtination, as touching the act of God prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinating, &amp; as I have ſhewed, becauſe both are eternall and the act of Gods will, which is God himſelfe: and withall to deviſe a cauſe hereof, is to caſt our ſelves upon an unavoydable abſurdity, as namely to ſay, That God did ordaine that upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of this or that in men, he would ordaine ſome of them to ſolvation, and others unto damnation. And indeed the harſhneſſe of the Tenent, conſiſts chiefly in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding theſe different conſiderations, whereby a colour is caſt, as if we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that God did decree to damne men of his meere pleaſure and not for ſin.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. As touching the ſecond which is this, <hi>That the finall impenitency and damnation of reprobates are neceſſary, and unavoydable by Gods abſolute decree.</hi> Here as it were to make weight, impenitency and damnation are clapt together, as unavoydable by Gods ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute decree; whereas it is without all queſtion, that ſuppoſing impenitency to be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, damnation is unavoydable by the Law of God, as who hath ordained, that whoſoever dies in impenitency ſhall be damned. And as for impenitency, doth this Author, or any Arminian deny it to be a fruit of that originall corruption wherein all are borne? I perſwade my ſelfe they doe not. <hi>Corvinus</hi> profeſſeth of all, That by the ſinne of Adam, they are, <hi>conjecti in neceſſitatem peccandi.</hi> Then againe doth he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Defenſ. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.</hi> pag. 394.</note> that any is able to cure this but God. It ſeems he doth not by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, where he ſignifieth that God (in his opinion) did not abſolutely intend to leave men to that woefull eſtate wherein they were borne. What then? Will he have God bound to cure it in all? If ſo, then certainly he doth cure it in all. For it were impoſſible God ſhould not doe that, whereunto he is obliged in the way of juſtice. But nothing more manifeſt, then that God doth not cure it in all: therefore certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is not bound to cure it in all. But I imagine he conceives that God is ready to cure it in all, and it is mans fault that he doth not cure it in any. As much as to ſay, if man would doe ſomewhat which he may doe, then God would give him repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Here is good ſtuffe towards; and undoubtedly, this is the criticall point as touching the nature of efficacious grace. Yet this I know full well, how carefull the greateſt Rabbies amongſt the Arminians are to decline. And will it not manifeſtly follow herehence, that the grace of repentance is given <hi>ſecundum merita,</hi> according to ſome good work of man that went before? Which was condemned in the Synode of Paleſtine above 1200 years agoe; Nay what will you ſay, if their doctrine hereabouts

And in this caſe it ſhall not be true that God ſhews mercy on whom he will, in giving faith and repentance, but rather he ſhall ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on whom man will. And like as when a queſtion is made, why ſuch a man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by the Magiſtrate, no wiſe man will anſwer becauſe it is the pleaſure of the Magiſtrate ſo to reward him, but rather repreſent the cauſe on mans part, why he was reward: ſo if God ſhews mercy in giving repentance according to ſome preparation found in one man, rather then in another, it ſhall not be ſaid, that God hath mercy on whom he will, but rather the reaſon on mans part is to be repreſented, why God doth give him repentance. Yet theſe Petitions he calls <hi>maxima gravamina</hi> on the part of Reprobation.</p>
                              <p>And will he not give us leave to propoſe in proportion hereunto, our <hi>maxima grava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina,</hi> as touching their opinion in point of election? namely. 1. That it is not the meer pleaſure of God, but the faith and repentance of a man foreſeen, that is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cauſe of divine election. 2. And that every man hath power to believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and no man hath more cauſe to be thankfull unto God; for giving him any more grace to believe and repent (in the way of grace preventing) then he gives to reprobates. I ſpeak of reprobate men, but for ought I yet know to the contrary, I may as well deliver it of the reprobate Angells. And as touching that which they call grace ſubſequent, which is only Gods concurrence, ſeeing God affords that to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinfull act, they may thank themſelves, rather then God for that, like as for Gods concurrence unto any act of ſinne. Theſe doctrines are no <hi>gravamina</hi> to the tender conſciences of our Adverſaries.</p>
                              <p>The doctrine oppoſite to this which here he diſlikes muſt needs be this, <hi>God hath not abſolutely purpoſed from eternity of his meer will and pleaſure, but upon conſideration of actuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in ſinne and unbeliefe, to caſt off men from grace and glory.</hi> Now this actuall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in unbeliefe I preſume muſt be finall; and upon the conſideration hereof, God caſts them off from grace: but I pray from what grace? ſurely from the grace of faith; otherwiſe it ſtands not in any contradiction to our Tenent. So that their doctrine in the iſſue comes to this, Whom God foreſees that they will not believe unto death, he decrees that they ſhall not believe unto death: and applied unto repentance, thus; Whom God foreſees that they will not repent unto death, he decreeth that they ſhall not repent unto death. This is the ſober and ſavoury doctrine of theſe impugners of the grace of God: and yet they perceive not what a ſpirit of giddineſſe poſſeſſeth them in this.</p>
                              <p>It is without queſtion (I think) that God leaves many in that woefull eſtate which here is called corruption of nature (no more, without any ſpecification wherein it conſiſts) the guilt whereof is eternall death; and ſeeing that if he ſo leaves them, it cannot be denied, but that God intended ſo to leave them. All the queſtion is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God did abſolutely intend to leave them. Now had this Author, as he profeſſeth his diſlike of Gods abſolue intention hereof, ſo dealt clearly, and ſhewed how he did intend ſo to leave ſome, as namely upon what condition, or upon foreſight whereof, and withall given ſome proofe of his aſſertion, his ingenuity had been commendable. Yet we ſay, that God did not at all intend to leave men in this ſtate. For the terme, men in this place being indefinite, it is capable of truth either way. And this Author defines not whether he ſpeaks of ſome or of all. We willingly grant, he doth not leave his elect in that woefull ſtate, but brings them out of it by faith and repentance; which are expreſſely called the gifts of God, in holy Scripture. But as for Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, I doe not find he gives either faith or repentance unto them. And <hi>Auſtin lib.</hi> 5. <hi>contra Julian.

Then againe, it were worth the knowing of this Author, whether any Infants of Turkes and Saracens departing this life in their infancy, are left in this woefull eſtate.

For it is well known, that youth goeth before old age; yet no man will ſay, that the opinions of men in their youth, are more likely to be ſound, then the opinions of riper age. Neither doth any man call or account youth Antiquity. Yet our Fathers we call our Ancients, becauſe they have gone before us, but little reaſon there is in my judgement, to count their faith the more ſound by reaſon of ſuch Antiquity; no more then why the opinions of man in his youth, ſhould be reputed more ſound, then the opinions of his age. For as there is a youth in man; ſo there is to be acknowledged a youth of the world; and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the Chriſtian World, even of the Church of God. The Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks in this language. For even they who were the great Anceſtors of the Jews in the daies of Jeremy, are called the youth of Iſraell, as the youth of Gods Church. Jerem. 2. 2. <hi>I remember thee with the kindneſſe of thy youth, and the love of thy marriage, when thou wentſt after me in the wilderneſſe, in a land that was not ſowen. Iſrael was as a thing hallowed unto the Lord, &amp;c</hi> Ezech. 16. 60. <hi>I will remember my Covenant made with thee in the daies of thy youth.</hi> In like ſort the Ancients counting them immediately from the Apoſtles daies, are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry youth of the Church Chriſtian. Now like as it is not to be exſpected that a man ſhould have as great perfection of knowledge in his youth, as in his age; ſo neither is it to be ſuppoſed, that the Church of Chriſt ſhould have as great perfection of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in her youth as in her age. This is to be underſtood <hi>caeteris paribus;</hi> otherwiſe there lies a double exception againſt it: the One in the way of Gods extraordinary mercy, the Other in the way of Gods extraordinary judgement. For God may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily inſpire a young man with the ſpirit of Prophecy, and ſo make him wiſer then the aged. Such was the condition of Gods exuberant grace in the daies of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, enduing them with power from on high, not only to inſtruct them with all ſpirituall wiſdome and underſtanding in the myſteries of the Goſpell, but ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them alſo to expreſſe it in diverſe languages, that ſo they might be able Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, to carry the glad tidings of ſalvation over all the World. On the other ſide, the ſinnes of the Chriſtian world not embracing Gods Truth with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56120:28"/>
love, may deſerve at the hands of God, that he ſhould give them over to illuſions to believe lies. Then no marvaile if our former light ſet in obſcure darkneſſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate daies come in place of better and more noble times; which may more eaſily come to paſſe, conſidering that the light of the Goſpell is a ſpirituall light of faith, no naturall light of reaſon; though even this naturall light of reaſon comes to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and perfected by that light of grace.</p>
                                 <p>But it may be ſaid, that They who lived neer the Apoſtles daies, are like to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with the truth of God then wee. I have found ſome to pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this conceit, and it runns ſmooth and glibb, and it ſeems very plauſible to winne approbation. But as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith of ſome things, that <hi>acutule ſonant,</hi> but <hi>diſcuſſa reperiuntur obtuſa:</hi> ſo many times it falls out, that reaſons plauſible at firſt, when explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration comes, prove very unſound; like the fruit <hi>Solinus</hi> writes of, which grew about Sodome, Faire to the eye, but being cruſhed <hi>in cineres abeunt &amp; vanam fuliginem.</hi> And for the diſcovering of the emptineſſe of this reaſon, I proceed thus.</p>
                                 <p>When you ſay of thoſe Ancients, that they were neer to the Apoſtles. I demand whether the meaning be, they were neer to the times of the Apoſtles, or neer to the Perſons of the Apoſtles, or neer to the word of the Apoſtles. The former two, doe nothing at all conduce to the perfection of Chriſtian knowledge, or ſoundneſſe of faith. For certainly both Jews and Heathens profeſſed enemies to the croſſe of Chriſt were as neer to their Times and Perſons as believing Chriſtians, but they were not ſo familiarly acquainted with their word. But as touching familiar acquaintance with the word of the Apoſtles; as alſo the embracing of it by faith: Nothing I truſt hindereth us from being as neer to the Apoſtles, as the Ancients were. Nay it is well known, that as touching divers peeces of the books of the New Teſtament, we receive them for Canonicall, which many of the Ancients doubted of. And as touching di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers books concerning the times of the Old Teſtament, they are diſcovered unto us to be Apocryphall, which to many of the Ancients were not.</p>
                                 <p>But it may be ſaid, that theſe Ancients to whom they pretend ſo much reverence (which indeed is but reverence to themſelves, and to ſerve their own turnes) were ſo neer to the Apoſtles, that they not only were partakers of their writings, but of their Preaching alſo by word of mouth? To this I anſwer.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. That it is a very rare thing to meet with any ſuch now adaies, unleſſe it be ſome counterfeit Author: neither doe I find any ſuch alleadged by any, leaſt of all by any Arminian, who yet upon my knowledge doe diſcourſe after this manner, as touching their neerneſſe to the Apoſtles.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. But ſuppoſe there were any ſuch, and they ſhould tell us what they heard preached by the Apoſtles, ſhall we take their relations for Oracles, and make the word of God to conſiſt, partly of that which is written by them, and partly of that which is not written, but delivered by word of mouth, and commended unto us by tradition? Then farewell the doctrine of Proteſtants concerning the rule of faith, that it is only the written-word; and let us with the Papiſts, joyne thereunto traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to make up a compleat Rule of Faith.</p>
                                 <p>It may be farther ſaid, that by reaſon of their neerneſſe to the Apoſtles, they may be better acquainted with the meaning of the word written.</p>
                                 <p>To which I anſwer; if ſo, then either from the Apoſtles own mouthes, or by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from others. Of any that report what they heard from the Apoſtles own mouths, they alleadge none. If they did, what were this other then to bring in Tradition to be a Rule, if not of faith, yet of interpretation of Gods word, which is as foule every way as the former, conſidering that ſoundneſſe of faith, is grounded upon the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of interpretation of Gods word. If only by relation from others, the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions lye againſt this and over and above, this muſt be of ſomewhat farre leſſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority then the former: it being ſo difficult a matter to report from another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adding ſomewhat of his own, whether it be much or little, as <hi>Chaucer</hi> ſpeaketh.</p>
                                 <p>Laſtly, let the Commentaries of theſe daies, be compared with the Commentaries of the Ancients, and let the indifferent reader judge, which of them are moſt true, moſt learned, moſt ſubſtantiall. So that I ſuppoſe, I may be bold to conclude, that this reaſon drawn from the neerneſſe of the Ancients to the Apoſtles, how plauſible ſoever it ſeems at firſt ſight, yet indeed is of no force.</p>
                                 <p>Now to the contrary we have theſe reaſons.</p>

1. Like as it is fit every man ſhould profit in the knowledge of God more and more, as long as he lives: ſo in all likelihood, the Chriſtian world doth profit more and more, as they draw neerer to the end of the world, excepting thoſe times of Gods judgements in giving the world over to illuſions to believe lies. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did profit, as in other points of Chriſtian knowledge, ſo in this as concerning Predeſtination, and blames the Maſſilienſes for not profiting with him. <hi>De Praedeſtin.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 4. <hi>Videtis quid tunc de fidei &amp; operibus ſentiebam, quamvis de commendandâ dei gratiâ labor arem; In qua ſententia iſtos fratres nostros eſſe nunc video: quia non ficut legere libros meos, ita curaverunt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficere mecum.</hi>

                                 <p n="2">2. We have more means and helps for our furtherance in Chriſtian knowledge, then they had, and that in divers reſpects. Firſt, becauſe we enjoy their labours, they enjoyed not ours, nor the like before them. So that by the reading of their writings we ſoon attain to that knowledge which they had, they communicating it unto us; and it were very ſtrange we ſhould adde nothing thereunto; eſpecially conſidering that <hi>Veritas</hi> was wont to be accounted <hi>temporis filia:</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> accounts it an eaſy thing to adde; Any man ſaith he may doe that, <gap reason="foreign">

A tall man is able to diſcover much farther then a Dwarfe, but let a Dwarfe be advanced upon the ſhoulders of that tall man, and he will diſcover much farther then he. Let then thoſe Antients goe for tall fellowes in the diſcovery of Chriſtian truth, let the Divines of moderne ages be but Dwarfes, as the Children of Iſrael ſeemed to be, but Grashop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in compariſon of the Canaanites, eſpecially to the ſonnes of <hi>Anack;</hi> yet if by their pious labours and induſtries, which they have with much ingenuity communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto us, they ſuffer us to get upon their ſhoulders, ſhall not we though Dwarfes, be enabled hereby to diſcover ſomewhat more then they? The Eagle is a fowle of great ſtrength and ſoareth high, the higheſt of all Kites and Haukes, yet let her carry a Wren along with her on her ſhoulders in her aëriall aſcentions, when ſhe is weary and can fly no higher, can it ſeem ſtrange, if the Wren carried thus high by this Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim of fowles, preſumes of her own ſtrengh to fly a little higher then ſhe? or is this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny glory to the Wren, or diſparagement to the Eagle?</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. Secondly Have not we better helpes of Art then they, eſpecially as touching the knowledge of the Tongues, and Logicall reſolutions of the Text. The Latine Fathers moſt of them were little acquainted with the Greek; neither Latine nor Greek Fathers were uſually much acquainted with the Hebrew: <hi>Origen</hi> amongſt the Greek, and Hierom amongſt the Latine, had not their fellows for this.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. Laſtly, the Ancients in their daies were not ſo put unto it as the latter; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing did more quicken them, or doth us, then contentions with Heretiques. And therefore look how they were exerciſed with Hereſies, ſo it is to be expected they were beſt ſeen in thoſe Articles of Faith, which were moſt ſhaken by Heretiques. This both Auſtin and Gregory take notice of; and Auſtin is moſt frequent herein, ſome paſſages to this purpoſe I ſhall relate hereafter. Now before Pelagius his daies, the Fathers were much exerciſed in oppoſing the Manichees, and accordingly gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the maintenance of Free-will, as Aniarius obſerves by the relation of Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Senenſis. But Pelagius was the firſt that oppoſed Gods grace; and therefore thoſe <note place="margin">

                                 <p>And now am I come to the treating of Ancients no longer in generall, but in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reference to the doctrine of predeſtination. Now herein the Papiſts themſelves (who in other points labour to beat us down with nothing ſo much as with the noiſe of Antiquity) are willing to confeſſe that in the point of grace and predeſtination we need not trouble our ſelves, with inquiry after the doctrine of the Ancients before Pelagius roſe, and that upon the ground before mentioned, to wit, becauſe they were nothing exerciſed hereabouts. As for example <hi>Bellarmine, De Grat. &amp; lib. Arbitr. lib.</hi> 1. c. 14. having propoſed diverſe paſſages of the Fathers favouring, as it ſeemed, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine wherewith Pelagius troubled the peace of Gods Church, makes Auſtin to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for him, <hi>Veteres Patres qui ante Pelagium floruerunt, quaeſtionem iſtam nunquam accuratè tractaſſe, ſed incidentèr ſolum, &amp; quaſi per tranſitum illam attigiſſe.

                                    <hi>&amp; Nazianzenum:</hi> yet he takes a courſe to reconcile them to the truth; ſo doth Sixtus Senenſis Bibl. Sanct. lib. 6. Annota. 251. ſo doth Alvarez. de Auxil. lib. 5. diſp. 37.</p>
                                 <p>Again conſider. The decrees of predeſtination and reprobation are ſecret, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe they appeare of what condition they are, but by the manner of their executions. Now their executions doe conſiſt partly in beſtowing ſalvation on ſome, and inflicting damnation on others; partly in beſtowing the grace of faith and repentance on ſome, and denying it unto others. As touching ſalvation and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation we willingly profeſſe, that the ſalvation of men of ripe years, doth alwaies preſuppoſe Faith and perſeverance therein; and the damnation of others doth alwaies preſuppoſe finall perſeverance in ſinne unrepented of. But we deny that herehence it followeth, that either faith precedes the decree of ſalvation, or ſinne precedes the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of damnation, or the preſcience of either. That faith cannot precede election, nor ſinne reprobation, is evident; For as much as election and reprobation are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, but faith and ſinne are things temporall: but that wich is temporall cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede that which is eternall. Neither doth it follow, that becauſe faith precedes ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore faith precedes the decree of ſalvation. For it is faith exiſtent in time that precedes ſalvation; but no Divine will ſay that faith exiſtent in time, precedes Gods decree of ſalvation, unleſſe it be ſome ſuch as maintaine with Vorſtius, that Gods decrees are not eternall. In like ſort, it is ſinne exiſtent in time, that precedes damnation; but no wiſe Divine will ſay, that ſinne exiſtent in time precedes Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of damnation; the former being a thing temporall but this decree eternall. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, neither will it follow that becauſe faith precedes ſalvation and ſinne damnation, therefore the foreſight of faith, is antecedanious to the decree of ſalvation, and the foreſight of ſinne is antecedent to the decree of damnation. For no Enthymeme of this nature is ſound, but ſo farre forth as it is reducible into a good Categorical Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme, whereof theſe Enthymems are uncapable. For Enthymems reducible unto good Syllogiſmes muſt agree, either in their Subjects or in their Predicates, but theſe doe not. Again all the termes in a good Enthymeme muſt be expreſſed in that Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme whereunto it is reduced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But each of theſe Enthymemes conſiſteth manifeſtly of four termes; as in the firſt, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap>e, Faith, and the Foreſight of faith, Salvation and the Decree of ſalvation; Of the ſecond, theſe, Sinne, and Foreſight of ſinne, Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the Decree of damnation; and conſequently that Syllogiſme whereunto ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe quaternary of termes is clap'd, cannot be good; For no Categoricall Syllogiſme is good that conſiſteth of foure termes. As for the reducing of them into a Syllogiſme Hypotheticall, ſuch Reductions were never heard of in the Schooles of the learned and that for juſt reaſon; becauſe that is no courſe to juſtify the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Enthymemes, but a meer begging of that which is in queſtion. As in caſe a man ſhould reduce it thus; If faith be precedanious to ſalvation, then the foreſight of faith is precedanious to the decree of ſalvation; But faith is precedanious to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Therefore it is precedanious to the decree of ſalvation. In this Hypotheticall Syllogiſme, the conſequence of the Major is the very Enthymeme which is in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the ſubſtance of it and conſequently no proving of it, but a meere begging of it. Yet notwithſtanding we doe not deny, but that God did decree that no man ſhould be ſaved, but ſuch as being of ripe years, ſhould be found to perſevere in faith unto death none ſhould be damned, but ſuch as ſhould be found finally to perſevere in ſinne. The other execution of theſe decrees conſiſts (as I ſaid) in the beſtowing of the grace of faith and repentance on ſome, and denying it unto others. Now the queſtion is, Whether God be indeed the author of faith and repentance, yea, or no; and becauſe the Arminians dare not profeſſedly deny this. (though lately they are come ſo farre as profeſſedly to deny that Chriſt merited it) therefore let the queſtion proceede about the manner how God beſtowes it, as namely, whether he beſtowes it of his meer pleaſure on ſome, denying it to others, or, Whether the reaſon why God beſtowes it on ſome and not on others, be, becauſe God findes ſome good work in one, which he findes not in another. This queſtion being decided, it will clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, whether predeſtination proceeds upon the foreſight of ought in man, yea or no. For if God of his meer pleaſure doth beſtow faith on one, and not on another, it followes undeniably, that God predeſtinated him hereunto abſolutely, and of his meer pleaſure, without conſideration of any future work of man. But if God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes faith on man upon conſideration of ſome precedent work of his, which was
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56120:29"/>
not the work of God, then (and not otherwiſe neither) it will follow, that upon the conſideration of that future work of man, God did elect him unto faith, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate faith unto him. So that if we deſire ſincerely and ingeniouſly to inquire what was the opinion of the Ancients about the abſoluteneſſe of predeſtination, we ſhould ſtate the queſtion as touching Predeſtination unto faith, and not as touching Predeſtination unto ſalvation. For we all confeſſe that God predeſtinated no man unto ſalvation, but ſuch as he foreſaw, coming unto ripe years, would believe ſooner or later. And therefore the main queſtion between the Remonſtrants and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonſtrants was, whether this decree were the whole decree of Predeſtination, and whether there were not another decree of Predeſtination beſides, as namely, whether God did not decree to beſtow faith on ſome, and deny it unto others. And ſecondly to inquire, Whether this decree of beſtowing faith on ſome, did not proceed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods good pleaſure, without conſideration of any different work in man. And the moſt compendious reſolution hereof, is to inquire of the manner how God carrieth himſelfe in the beſtowing of faith and repentance on ſome, and denying it unto others; as namely, Whether on his meer pleaſure he hath not mercy on ſome, giving them faith and repentance, and of his meer pleaſure, denyes the gift of faith and repentance unto others. Now let the Fathers, (whoſoever thinks good) be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to bring in their ſuffrages on this Article, and remember what was decreed in the firſt Synode that was gathered, to make peace in the Church after Pelagius had diſturbed it, namely, <hi>Gratiam non dari ſecundum merita,</hi> that is, as Bellarmine acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, <hi>Gratiam non dari ſecundum opera.</hi> Laſtly, all of us now a daies conſent, as <note place="margin">

Now let this Author or any other, repreſent unto us, what footing he finds in Antiquity concerning this. But I come to anſwer particularly, according to this Authors text.</p>
                                 <p>He cannot find abſolute and inevitable reprobation to have any footing in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Belike he can find reprobation evitable; a ſtrange phraiſe either way. Theſe attributes applied to damnation doe carry a faire ſenſe with them, damnation being a work of God wrought in time, and undoubtedly may be avoided, may be incurred for the time to come. But reprobation is eternall as God himſelfe, and how that ſhould be fancied to be of an avoidable condition for the time to come, I cannot comprehend, unleſſe this Author be of their opinion, who deſire to ſhape Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of a revocable nature, as being both to impute unto him an impotent immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, as ſome are pleaſed to phraiſe it.</p>
                                 <p>But leave we reprobation unavoidable, take we the abſolute nature of it into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: this he cannot find in all Antiquity. But conſider I pray, he pretends theſe motives, as inducements to change his former opinion: ſo then belike, he ſtood ſometimes for reprobation abſolute; but did he find any footing in Antiquity for it, what time he embraced it? if he did formerly embrace it, notwithſtanding he found no footing in Antiquity for it, why ſhould he now relinquiſh it, for finding no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Antiquity for it? Belike the older he waxeth, the more he groweth in love with Antiquity. Again when formerly he did embrace the doctrine of abſolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, upon what grounds did he embrace it? was it becauſe he was in hope he ſhould hereafter find Antiquity for it? or was it only for the authority of them who brought him up in this opinion? What ſorry grounds are theſe to build a mans faith upon? Yet this is not our courſe to impoſe Articles of faith on any, but rather to endoctrinate them out of the word of God. If then a mans Chriſtian faith be built upon the Word of God, is it a Chriſtian courſe to renounce it, or to queſtion the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of it, becauſe he finds no footing in Antiquity for it? What then ſhall become of the faith of Laicks, and ſuch as are unlearned? Muſt the writings of the Fathers be tranſlated into all vulgar Languages, and the unlearned addict themſelves to the ſtudy of them, leaſt otherwiſe their faith prove a wavering faith, for want of finding Antiquity to favour it? Belike the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles, are no part of Antiquity, in this Authors more mature judgement. But if formerly the doctrine of abſolute reprobation were received upon the evidence of Gods word, as it is fit the faith of every Chriſtian ſhould be grounded thereupon, eſpecially the faith of a Divine called to be a Teacher of others; I ſhould think there were no juſt cauſe of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, but upon diſcovery of the errour of thoſe grounds, whereupon formerly it was builded; and the diſcovery hereof alone, were chiefly to the preſent purpoſe,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56120:30"/>
namely to ſhew juſt cauſe of change of mind, &amp; alteration of judgement, but no ſuch courſe doe I find taken here. Theſe motives and reaſons here propoſed, may carry a ſhew of reaſon, why a man being yet to chuſe his faith in theſe particulars, poſſeſſed with neither way, but indifferent, might preferre one way before another, one opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before another, but nothing ſufficient to juſtify a change, unleſſe the weakneſſe of former grounds be laid open. For it may be that the former grounds might be ſuch as upon due compariſon would be found to overweigh theſe pretences. For upon view that I have taken of the diſcourſe following, I find not one argument drawn from thoſe places of Scripture that treat of election and reprobation; theſe I find are purpoſely declined as ſo many rocks, as if the Author feared to make ſhipwrack of his errours (pardon my boldneſſe in ſo naming them, <hi>Auſtin</hi> is my precedent in this ſaying, <hi>Hoc ſcio contra istam praedeſtinationem quam ſecundum ſcripturas defendimus, neminem ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi errando diſputare poſſe)</hi> but in the mean time while he fears to make ſhipwrack of his errours, let him take heed leaſt he make ſhipwrack of a good conſcience.</p>

mankind conſidered <hi>in Maſſa damnata</hi> as he commonly calls it, that is, in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Maſſe; but not alwaies, but ſometimes he ſpeaks of it, and accommodates it cleerely unto the Maſſe of mankind uncorrupt, yea, as yet not created, as there I have ſhewed. And as for the right ordering of Gods decrees, and the right ſtating of the object of predeſtination and reprobation, We deſire no better, nor other ground then that of the Apoſtle, <hi>God hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth,</hi> that is, he cures infidelity and hardnes of heart in whom he will, by beſtowing faith and repentance upon them, and leaves it uncured in whom he will by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith and repentance unto them. And as for the rigour of this Tenent (as it is commonly accounted) of making the Maſſe of mankind not created the object of predeſtination, I have already ſhewed the vanity of that conceit and denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for as much as hereby neither is the decree of damnation made to precede the conſideration of ſinne, no nor of finall impenitency in any moment of nature, nor in any moment of nature is the decree of ſalvation made by mee, to precede the conſideration of finall perſeverance in faith and repentance. But whereas ſome, who are moſt rigid indeed in their diſcourſe, make the decree of ſaving ſome and damning others to precede the decree of creating and permitting of ſinne both o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall and actuall; others who are moſt diſſolute, make the decree of creating and permitting of ſinne, to precede the decree of ſaving ſome and damning others, My Opinion is equally removed from theſe extreames, and conceives none of theſe decrees to be either way ſubordinate, but all coordinate and ſimultaneous, as being decrees only of various means, tending to one and the ſame end; thus God doth decree both to create ſome, and to permit to ſinne, and finally to perſevere therein, and to damne them for their ſinne, to the manifeſtation of his glory in the way of juſtice vindicative. On the other ſide, God doth decree to create others, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to ſinne, and raiſe them out of ſinne by faith and repentance, and reward them with everlaſting life, to the manifeſtation of his glory, in the way of mercy mixed with juſtice.</p>

                                    <hi>They did all generally agree,</hi> ſaith this Author, <hi>upon the contrary concluſion.</hi> Now the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Concluſion to <hi>abſolute and unavoidable reprobation</hi> is to maintain conditionall and avoidable reprobation; but this is not the contrary concluſion here ſpecified by this Author, but rather that damnation was avoydable, ſuch is his looſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; whereas there is no queſtion at all concerning damnation, whether it be conditionall or abſolute. We all confeſſing, that like as ſalvation is not ordained to befall any man of ripe years, but upon the performance of faith and repentance and finall perſeverance therein; ſo damnation is not ordained to be the portion of any, but upon their finall perſeverance in ſinne. In like ſort as touching the poſſibility of ſalvation, not one Divine of ours, that I know, denyes the poſſibility of any mans ſalvation while he lives in this World. Doctor Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon indeed hath an opinion, that a man may proceed ſo farre in ſinne in this life, that the doore of repentance may be ſhut upon him. Wee have no ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; We acknowledge, that as God calls ſome at the firſt houre, ſo may ſome be called at the laſt houre of the day, yea the Thiefe upon the Croſſe, yea, <hi>inter Pontem &amp; Fontem.</hi> In a word, We ſay plainly, that it is poſſible for any man at any time to be ſaved by grace giving repentance: without repentance none can be ſaved; which is, I preſume, without queſtion between us. In like ſort it is poſſible for any man to repent, provided that God be pleaſed to give him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and whether God will give him repentance or no we know not. Therefore the Apoſtle inſtructs Timothy after this manner, <hi>The ſervant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but muſt be gentle towards all men, apt to teach, ſuffering the evill, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing them with meekneſſe that be contrary minded,</hi>

And which is worſe then this, as that which ſtands in oppoſition to common ſenſe, they wil be driven to profeſſe, that God is ready to give a reprobate repentance, in caſe he will repent, yea the very will to repent, in caſe he will repent. This deſperate reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution I have already found by experience, and if I be not deceived, breathed by the very ſame ſpirit that breatheth heere.</p>

That this is farre from juſtifying, that abſolute reprobation, and abſolute ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction had no footing in Antiquity, that the Upper way was never taught for the ſpace of 600 years, nor the Lower way till the time of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                                 <p n="2">2. Albeit not ſome but all had maintained election and reprobation to proceed according to foreknowledge of mens works, yet this nothing hinders the abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe either of election or reprobation. For conſider, it is one thing to ſpeak of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto grace, another to ſpeak of election unto glory; one thing to ſpeak of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, as it ſignifies a purpoſe to deny grace, another thing to ſpeak of it, as it ſignifies a purpoſe to inflict damnation. It was never known I think, that any main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that God upon the foreſight of mens faith, did elect them unto faith, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to give them faith; or that God foreſeeing men would not believe, nor repent, did decree that they ſhould neither believe nor repent. Upon which brainſick conceit our Arminians are caſt now a daies, and all the embracers of <hi>Scientia Media:</hi> But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them profeſſed indeed that God did decree to beſtow ſalvation upon them whom he foreſaw would finally perſevere in faith and repentance; and to damne thoſe whom he foreſaw would finally perſevere in infidelity or impenitency. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge as much as they, but ſtill the way is open to enquire of the order of theſe, namely, Whether the foreſight of faith and repentance were before the decree of ſalvation, or after it, or ſimultaneous with it: Whether the foreſight of infidelity and impenitency were before the decree of damnation, or after it, or ſimultaneous with it; but where is any ſuch queſtion to be found amongſt the Ancients? We wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly profeſſe that God did not purpoſe to beſtow eternall life on any of ripe years, but as a reward of their faith and repentance and good workes; that God did not purpoſe to inflict damnation on any of ripe years, but as a condigne puniſhment of their finall infidelity and impenitency; and the Ancients who maintained that God decreed to ſave ſome and damne others, according to his preſcience of the piety of the one, and impiety of the other, had no other meaning that I know, or this Author is able to make good, or any other, as I am perſwaded.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. But let us farther enquire what thoſe Ancients thought concerning faith and repentance; as whether they thought them to be the gifts of God, or no; dares this Author or any Arminian deny, they maintained them to be the gifts of God, the Scripture being ſo full and expreſſe for this? Secondly, enquire what their opinion was concerning the manner how God gave faith to one, and not to another, as 'tis manifeſt he did not, he doth not give it to all; as namely, whether it was of the meer pleaſure of God, that he converted ſome, and not others; or whether he beſtowed faith on ſome, and not on others, becauſe he found thoſe ſome to have prepared themſelves for the receiving of faith, not ſo others. If it was of the meer pleaſure of God, it manifeſtly followeth, that election unto grace and reprobation from grace, was abſolute: which is the main thing in queſtion in theſe our daies. For we who are accounted moſt rigid herein, doe not affect to ſay, That God decreed to ſave
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56120:32"/>
whom he will, or to damne whom he will; but to the contrary we ſay, God decreed to ſave none, but ſuch as believe and repent, and to damne none, but ſuch as dye in infidelity or impenitency: but we profeſſe willingly, that God decreed to beſtow faith and repentance on whom he would, and deny it to whom he would, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being expreſſe, that God hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth. And <hi>Auſtin</hi> is moſt frequent in this profeſſion, and this is that Grace which he acknowledgeth to be the foundation of predeſtination, and wherein both <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Nazianzene,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> did agree with him. And <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in ſpeciall ſort he mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies for this profeſſion. And <hi>Calvin</hi> hereupon obſerves, that whereas the Pelagians charged him, with differing from the ancients herein. <hi>Valet Auguſtini teſtimonium,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>apud eos, qui libenter in Patrum authoritate acquieſcunt. Quanquam non patitur Auguſtinus ſe a reliquis diſjungi, ſed claris testimoniis divortium hoc cujus invidia gravabant eum Pelagiani, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendit falſum eſſe. Citat enim ex Ambroſio (lib. de Praedeſtin. ſanct. cap.</hi> 19.) <hi>Chriſtus quem dignatur vocat</hi> (here is the criticall point of this queſtion concerning the abſoluteneſſe of election and reprobation) <hi>Item ſi voluiſſet ex indevotis feciſſet devotos.

                                 <p n="4">4. Yet I confeſſe there was a time when <hi>Auſtin</hi> did not conceive faith to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the gifts of Gods ſpirit, but being exerciſed with the Pelagians, he came to acknowledge the ſpeciall grace of God in this; and hereupon made faith an effect of predeſtination, and not any precedent thereunto, and doubts not, but the Fathers would have expreſſed as much, had they been exerciſed with the Pelagians as he was; for ſo much he ſignifies unto <hi>Proſper</hi> as before I ſhewed, and withall ſhewes how in the foundation of predeſtination they agreed with him, in as much as they agreed in the nature of grace, acknowledging the converſion of the heart to be the gift of God; And not they only, but the whole Catholique Church, as appeared by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayers, that God would convert the hearts of Infidells; and to ſay, that God doth not convert the hearts of men according to the meer pleaſure of his will, but according to mens preparations, is clearly to maintaine that God gave grace accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto works, which doctrine was generally exploded as meer Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme.</p>
                                 <p n="5">5. Suppoſe they did all acknowledge the decree of election and reprobation, to be conditionall, yet if they interpreted this conditionally, not <hi>quoad actum Volentis,</hi> but <hi>quoad Res volitas,</hi> this is nothing oppoſite to the abſoluteneſſe of election and reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>quoad actum elegentis</hi> and <hi>reprobantis,</hi> but only <hi>quoad res volitas,</hi> to wit, ſalvation on the one ſide, and damnation on the other ſide. And we willingly acknowledge that God hath not ordained that ſalvation or damnation ſhall befall any man but in caſe they believe and repent, or refuſe to believe, or repent.

Now it liked not this Author to take his courſe to begin with Clemens Alexandrinus, and his Scholler Origen, as Voſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius doth: For albeit Origen was a man for his learning of great authority in the Church of God, in ſuch ſort that it was wont to be ſaid, that <hi>Origenis ingenium Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae Sacramentum,</hi> and no marvail if many followed him, and 'tis uſuall even with Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome in his Commentaries to follow him. Yet after his death, his Writings were found at length to have a very ill ſavour in the Catholique Church. And amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foul opinions found in him, one nearly concerning this very particular we have in hand, was that which Voſſius there delivers in this manner, <hi>Veterum multorum opinio eſt, putâſſe eum animas corporibus vel praedeſtinatorum, vel reproborum uniri pro iis quae bene vel male egiſſent ante conditum corporeum hunc mundum.</hi> Judge I pray whether here be not a ſweet noſegay for the Divill, as touching the foreſight of works, not to come, but of works paſt before they were borne, and thereupon their ſoules united either to bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies predeſtinated unto life, or reprobated unto death. Yet Voſſius would not have us think either Origen deceived by Clement (which no man ever ſaid that I know, neither doth Voſſius pretend any ſuch thing) or that Chryſoſtome was deceived by them, or thoſe that followed, by him, all this ſeems to be delivered only to croſſe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, who profeſſed the Greek and Latine Fathers were deceived by Origen. Yet it is well known of what eſtimation Origen was in the Church, none of the others like him, but what is his reaſon? becauſe forſooth Ireneus lib. 4. cap. 76. profeſſeth that God did deſtinate heaven to them that ſhould believe; and to them which ſhould not believe, hell. But could he be ignorant that Fulgentius profeſſeth the ſelfe ſame, lib. 1. <hi>ad Monimum;</hi> namely, <hi>Deum praedeſtinaſſe ad regnum quos ad ſe praeſcivit miſericordiae praevenientis auxilio redituros, &amp; in ſe miſericordiae ſubſequentis auxilio eſſe manſuros.</hi> Yet this very Author in his Preface profeſſeth that Fulgentius amongſt others, albeit they maintained that God did deſtinate no others to ſalvation, then ſuch as whom he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw by the pure gift of his grace, would have the beginnings of faith, and a good will, and perſevere in good, yet notwithſtanding they withall maintained, that this preſcience divine of their faith and perſeverance, did flow from Gods abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to ſave them. Nay Auſtin himſelfe in Joan. Tract. 42. (as Hunnius and others alleage him, and I find it true) hath theſe words of thoſe of whom our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Therefore you heare not, becauſe ye are not of God; Praecogniti erant quòd non fuerant credituri eâ fide quâ ſolâ poſſint a peccatorum obligatione liberari;</hi> and afterwards ſaith, <hi>ſecundum hanc prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinationem loquutus eſt Dominus.</hi> But will it herehence follow that Auſtin did deny abſolute predeſtination? Voſſius himſelfe acknowledgeth the contrary of him, as <note place="margin">Praef. in Hiſt. Pelag.</note> well as of Fulgentius, namely, that Gods foreknowledge of perſeverance in good, proceeded from Gods abſolute decree of ſaving them. And let every ſober reader judge whether upon the ſame grounds it doth not follow, that Gods foreknowledge of mans perſeverance in infidelity, doth not likewiſe follow from Gods abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of reprobating him. For what is the ground of the former, but this, that God had abſolutely decreed to give faith unto ſome? Now doth it not herehence follow, that God abſolutely decreed to deny faith unto others? For as Ambroſe ſaith, and as Auſtin alleageth out of him, <hi>ſi voluiſſet ex indevotis feciſſet devotos.</hi> Yet am not I of Voſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius his opinion in this. I ſay rather, Gods foreknowledge of one mans faith, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from his decree not of ſaving him, but of giving him faith; and Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of another mans finall perſeverance in infidelity, proceeds from Gods decree, not of damning him, but of denying him grace to cure his infidelity. And as for the decree of ſalvation, I deny it to be in any moment of nature, before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of giving grace; in like ſort, I deny the decree of damnation to be in any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56120:33"/>
of nature before the decree of permitting mans infidelity to continue uncured unto the end. And the criticall queſtion in this point conſiſts in this, Whether the granting of grace, or deniall of grace, be not meerely of the pleaſure of God, and not according to any different diſpoſitions in man; by grace underſtanding grace ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall to the working of faith and true repentance. And unleſſe the Ancients be ſhewed to have maintained, either that faith, and repentance, are not the gifts of God; or, that if they be the gifts of God, that God diſpenſeth his effectuall grace for the working of them, not according to the meer pleaſure of God, but according to the different diſpoſitions of men; all that they talke of the Ancients in this point, is meerly vaine and to no purpoſe.</p>

For it is apparent, that in the contrary doctrine Pelagius grounded his opinion concerning predeſtination. And Auſtin him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſometime thought that God, <hi>quem ſibi crediturum eſſe praeſcivit, ipſum elegit, cui ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſanctum daret, ut bona operando vitam aeternam conſequeretur:</hi> and why ſo? becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth he at that time conceived it to be mans work to believe, which ſaith he, I had never ſaid, had I known faith it ſelfe to have been amongſt the gifts of the holy Ghoſt. <hi>Retract. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. and therefore <hi>De Praedeſti.

                                 <p n="6">6. As before I ſhewed, Fulgentius himſelfe maintaines predeſtination to be <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum praeſcientiam;</hi> yet <hi>Voſſius</hi> acknowledgeth him as well as Auſtin, to have maintained the abſoluteneſſe of predeſtination.</p>
                                 <p n="7">7. Laſtly, this paſſage concerneth predeſtination alone, as it ſignifies the divine decree of conferring glory; but who ever was known to maintaine the divine decree of conferring grace to have been <hi>ſecundum praeſcientiam,</hi> according to foreſight of any work in man? For this is plainly to maintain, that grace is given according unto works, which in the Ancients phraiſe is all one, as to acknowledge, that grace is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven according unto merits, which is direct Pelagianiſme, and condemned 1200 years agoe in the Synod of Paleſtine.</p>

                                 <p>As for Hierome, this Author ſaith that he was an eager oppoſer of the Pelagians, but no where doth it appeare, that the point of predeſtination comes in queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Theſe very paſſages out of Hierome are propoſed by Grotius in his <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas Ordinum Hollandiae,</hi> and anſwered by Gratianus Civilis punctually, and long before by Bellarmine <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Grat. &amp; lib. arb. cap.</hi> 14.</p>
                                 <p>I anſwer, what is this any other, but that which the Fathers many of them have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in ſaying, that predeſtination is <hi>ſecundum praeſcientiam;</hi> And doth not Fulgentius affirm the ſame? Yet is he acknowledged by Voſſius, a maintainer of the abſoluteneſſe of predeſtination as well as Auſtin. Did Hierome deny faith to be the gift of God? or granting it to be the gift of God, did he maintaine, that God gave it according unto works? If not, but according to the meer pleaſure of his will, having mercy on ſome, while he hardned others; the caſe is cleare, that he maintained abſolute electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto faith. As for Gods decree of ſalvation and damnation, we willingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that God decreed to ſave no man but upon his finall perſeverance in faith and piety; to damne none, but ſuch as finally perſevere in infidelity and impenitency. Now compare we theſe decrees together, the decree of giving faith, and the decree of ſaving; which of theſe are moſt likely to be the foremoſt; it is apparent that ſalvation is more likely to be the end in reſpect of faith, and faith the means in reſpect of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then the contrary. And the generall and moſt received rule of Schooles is, that the intention of the end is before the intention of the means. I think the glory of God in the way of mercy, mixed with juſtice is the end of both; and that the decrees of giving faith and ſalvation are ſimultaneous, as decrees of means tending to the ſame end, and ſo neither before the other. But Hierome ſaith, that, <hi>ex Praeſcientia futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum naſcitur dilectio vel odium.</hi> I confeſſe he doth in a disjunctive manner thus, <hi>vel ex praeſcientia vel ex operibus.</hi> And we know that paſſions ſuch as Love and Hatred, are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56120:34"/>
commonly ſaid to be attributed to God, not <hi>quoad affectum</hi> but <hi>quoad effectum,</hi> and ſo they may fairely ſtand for ſalvation and damnation, which proceed <hi>ex operibus</hi> in Hieroms phraiſe. But admit he means hereby, <hi>decretum ſalvandi</hi> which riſing <hi>expraeſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia fidei,</hi> muſt preſuppoſe the decree of giving faith to precede. I anſwer then, there is to be acknowledged an impropriety of ſpeech, and here is place for Gerſons rule, <hi>Sancti non ſemper adverterunt ad proprietatem locutionis.</hi> And the rather becauſe Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome we never find exerciſed in this Controverſy. And it is againſt common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that faith ſhould be intended before ſalvation. And laſtly, this were to impute unto him to acknowledge 2 motive cauſe of Predeſtination <hi>quoad actum praedestinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis:</hi> which Aquinas profeſſeth againſt, as a thing impoſſible; namely, that there ſhould be a cauſe of Gods will <hi>quoad actum volentis;</hi> Nay he is bold to ſay that, <hi>No man was ſo mad to ſay that merits are the cauſe of Predeſtination quoad actum praedeſtinantis.</hi>

                                 <p>The laſt part of this Authors performance in the poynt of Antiquity is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Arles, ſubſcribing as he ſaith, the letter which was written by Fauſtus againſt Lucidus the Predeſtinarian (for ſo he ſtyles him) and in his Epiſtle he inſiſts upon two Anathema's, the one this, <hi>Anathema illi qui dixerit illum qui periit non accepiſſe ut ſalvus eſſe poſſit.</hi> The other this, <hi>Anathema illi qui dixerit quod vas contumcliae non poſſit affurgere, ut ſit vas in honorem.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Firſt, I will anſwer as touching the Anathema's themſelves, then as touching the credit and authority of this ſtory.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. As touching the Anathema's. The firſt proceeds as well of him that is baptized and afterwards periſheth, as of him that is a Pagan and never was baptized, and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his Paganiſme, as the Anathema it ſelfe witneſſeth, if it be repeated at full, thus, <hi>Anathema illi qui dixerit illum qui periit non accepiſſe, ut ſalvus eſſe poſſit, id eſt, vel de baptizato, vel de illius aetatis Pagano, qui credere potuit &amp; noluit.</hi> By which latter clauſe it appears, that <hi>accipere ut ſalvus eſſe poſſit,</hi> is no other then to receive <hi>Poſsibilitatem credendi</hi> (I ſay <hi>Poſſibilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi> not <hi>Potentiam,</hi> becauſe I find this is <hi>Faustus</hi> his uſuall phraiſe, as it was the phraiſe of <hi>Pelagius</hi> before him) and this is as much as to ſay, that every man hath power to believe if he will. Now obſerve I pray, This kind of power is meerely nature, not that which we commonly call Grace, whereby we underſtand ſomething diſtinct from nature. And Auſtin acknowledgeth both, De Gen. contr. Manichae. lib. 1. cap. 3, that all men, <hi>poſſunt credere ſi velint;</hi> and that this is no more then is ſignified by that naturall illumination wherewith God enlightens every man, when he comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, Iohn. 1. 9. And, De Praedeſt. Sanct. cap. 5. <hi>Poſſe habere fidem, ſicut poſſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere charitatem, naturae eſt hominum. Fidem verò habere, ſicut &amp; charitatem habere gratiae eſt fidelium.</hi> And more then this, the ſtate of the queſtion between <hi>Pelagius</hi> and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques of thoſe daies is ſo propoſed by Auſtin, as not at all to conſiſt about the poſſibility of believing or doing any good work, but meerly about the willing &amp; doing of it. In ſo much that Auſtin profeſſeth, that if Pelagius would acknowledge the will and doing of good to be from God, as he did the poſſibility hereof to be from God, there ſhould be an end of all controverſy between them, and Pelagius ſhould be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a good Catholique. This appears in his book, <hi>De Gratiâ Chriſti contra Pelagium &amp; Caeleſtium cap.</hi> 6.

                                 <p n="2">2. Now I come to the credit and authority of this ſtory concerning the Councell of Arles; and</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. I ſay, ſuppoſe it be a truth; yet about the yeare 494. there was a Roman Councell wherein <hi>Gelaſius</hi> and 70 Biſhops with him juſtify the writings of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Proſper,</hi> and condemne the writings of <hi>Caſſian</hi> and <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> by whoſe procurement it is here pretended the Biſhops of Arles ſubſcribed this Epiſtle of <hi>Fauſtus</hi> unto <hi>Lucidus.</hi> And the Fathers of this pretended Councell of Arles are not reckoned up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſixteen.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. The credit of this ſtory lyeth wholly upon Fauſtus his relation and his honeſty therein, a man infamous in the Church for oppoſing Auſtin and his doctrine of grace and predeſtination, as appears by the Writings of <hi>Fulgentius, Petrus Diaconus, Alchimus Avitus</hi> and others. <hi>Ado Viennenſis in Chron. ad ann.</hi> 492. writes of him thus. <hi>Fauſtus ex Abbate Monaſterii Licinenſis apud Regem Galliae Epiſcopus facius, Pelagianorum dogma deſtruere conatus</hi> (which yet may be made apparent to have been meerly in pretence) <hi>in erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem unde qui ejus ſenſus in hac parte Catholicos praedicant, ſicut Germadius de Viris illuſtribus ſcribens, omninò errant.

                                 <p>Thus they are reckoned up on both ſides by Voſſius, amongſt whom there is but one name common. To help this, Voſſius deviſeth a 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Councel of Arles and that the Biſhops mentioned to have ſubſcribed <hi>Fauſtus</hi> his Epiſtle, to be the Biſhops aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Councel of Arles, and not thoſe whom we read to have been aſſembled

at the Third. But that any ſuch Biſhops were aſſembled at a 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Councell of Arles he brings no evidence, that I find; but his own conjecture is the beſt ground for this. And all this pains is taken to ſalve <hi>Fauſtus</hi> his reputation in this. And the reaſon that moves <hi>Voſsius</hi> to conceive that this ſubſcription was not a meer fiction of <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> is this; Becauſe forſooth if this had been a meer fiction of <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> ſurely <hi>Maxentius</hi> in oppoſing him, would not have failed to have caſt this in his teeth. <hi>Binius</hi> is eager in the defence of theſe Epiſcopall ſubſcriptions, but withall confeſſeth, that either <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> himſelfe, or ſome in his name, practiſed to countenance his Books alſo by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of thoſe Biſhops. <hi>In fine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hujus Commentarii &amp; Libelli, ipſe Faustus, vel alius quis dolosè addider at haec verba, In quo quidem opuſculo poſt Arelatinſis Concilii ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem, novis erroribus deprehenſis adjici aliqua Synodus Lugdunenſis exegit, ut ſcilicet</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius) aliquo fuco venditari poſſet quaſi ſcriptum de gratiâ &amp; libero arbitrio Commentarium duae Synodi recepiſſent &amp; approbaſſent.</hi> Now if ſuch were the diſhoneſt art of <hi>Fauſtus</hi> in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting this, why might he not be as diſhoneſt in counterfeiting the former Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ſubſcriptions alſo? And if <hi>Voſſius</hi> his reaſon to ſalve <hi>Fauſtus</hi> his credit, were of force in this, why ſhould it not be in force in the other alſo? For <hi>Maxentius</hi> we doe not find to have excepted againſt his fidelity, more in the one then in the other? And why might not <hi>Maxentius</hi> be ignorant of them both? And in <hi>Biblioth.

And herein his devotion to this kind of Antiquity, where he thinketh it will ſerve his turne, he is content you ſhould conceive it doth exceed the devotion of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> yea and of Auſtin alſo; whoſe anſwer to Proſper he is content to paſſe by as not ſavouring ſo much of piety in his judgement, but the Maſſilienſes zeale of the Ancients repreſented by Proſper unto Auſtin, that is ſuitable to his humour, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth that well, and ſo well that he thinks it fit vehemently to <hi>miſtruſt thoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which they never approved, but diſliked and condemned.</hi> Yet of any condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion other then what is implied by Fauſtus, a man infamous, and whoſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56120:36"/>
Writings were condemned by 70 Biſhops, he makes no mention. And before Auſtins daies, and the daies of Pelagius, the Ancients were not exerciſed with any controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy hereabouts. And was their non-approbation of his doctrine, concerning abſolute predeſtination, any motive to Auſtin vehemently to miſtruſt the truth thereof? I think he will not ſay it was; and therefore I hope he will give <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> leave, never a whit the more for that cauſe, to miſtruſt the ſame doctrine, in granting the Ancients to have conceived predeſtination to proceed <hi>ſecundum praeſcientiam</hi> according unto foreknowledge, he is content to conform himſelfe to their judgement; but in miſtruſting the contrary doctrine, hereupon you muſt give him leave to follow his own, or any, rather then not <hi>Calvins</hi> or <hi>Beza's,</hi> but even Auſtins alſo, though never ſo much magnified by the Church of God, and his writings countenanced eſpecially againſt the Pelagians, and the contrary condemned, by other manner of Councells then Arelatenſe 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and Lugdunenſe. I remember when Epicurus was demanded why, ſeeing he followed Leucippus ſo much, he did not follow him throughout, made this anſwer ſaying, I doe as a man that is a thirſt when he takes the cup to drink, for he drinks what will ſerve his turne, and ſets the reſt by: ſo you muſt give this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor leave to repreſent his devotion to gray haires, ſo farre as they ſerve his turne, and no farther. Yet I have ſhewed how Auſtin maintaines, as touching the Ancients that went before him, that they concurred with him <hi>in fundomento praedeſtinationis,</hi> which he accounted the the doctrine of Free grace, and cites to this purpoſe <hi>Cyprian, Ambroſe,</hi> and <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> and by the common prayers of the Church, that God would convert the unbelievers unto the faith of Chriſt; that the ſame doctrine, which was in his judgement the foundation of predeſtination, as he maintained it according to the Word of God, was generally received in the Church of God.</p>
                                 <p>Before I part from this, I think fit to adde ſomething concerning the ſtile here gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Lucidus,</hi> before the revocation of his pretended error; for here I find him ſtiled the Predeſtinarian. Now I preſume this Author, that pretends ſo great reverence to gray haires, and ſo much preferres Antiquity before Novelty, hath good ground for this his denomination of him, and that out of Antiquity. Now I deſire he would be pleaſed to communicate unto us, his learned reading in Antiquity for this; and the rather, becauſe in the whole ſtory of the buſineſſe between <hi>Fauſtus</hi> and <hi>Lucidus,</hi> I find no mention of any ſuch attribute given to his perſon, or to the doctrine (reputed by <hi>Fauſtus</hi> erroneous) maintained by him. The terme <hi>Praedeſtinatus</hi> qualirying a perſon, I find firſt in <hi>Arnobius</hi> junior, and from that time I find not the Praedeſtinati, or Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinatians mentioned till the daies of <hi>Hinemarus,</hi> about the year of our Lord God 850. And as for the ſtory of the Predeſtinarian Hereſy, which this Author licks his lipps at, the originall whereof is referred to the yeare 415 by <hi>Sigibertus;</hi> it is very ſtrange, that in <hi>Auſtins</hi> daies it was not known unto him, or being known, not taken notice of by him, nor by <hi>Proſper</hi> neither after him. And <hi>Alphonſus à Caſtro</hi> in his Book <hi>contra Haereſes,</hi> profeſſeth that the Author of this Hereſy he found not, neither in <hi>Sigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> nor in any other; becauſe indeed not one of thoſe who wrote of Hereſics makes mention of this Hereſy, beſides <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Lutzenburg</hi> in his Catalogue of Heretiques; and he ſaith no more of it, then what <hi>Sigibert</hi> mentioneth in his Chronicle. And withall he addes, that after this errour was buried, by the ſpace of almoſt a thouſand years, it was revived by <hi>John Huſſe</hi> the Bohemian. Whereby it appears, that <hi>Alphonſus</hi> was not of this Authors opinion in cenſuring this <hi>Lucidus</hi> for a Predeſtinarian. And the firſt that I find to intimate ſo much is <hi>Hincmarus</hi> about the yeare 850. In like ſort <hi>Prateölus</hi> acknowledgeth that, <hi>Quis corum Dux &amp; inſtitutor fuerit, neſcitur.</hi> But <hi>Gerardus Voſſius</hi> hath herein helped us with this conjecture, referring the originall of this Hereſy to the Monks of Adrumetum; and Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtoriá Godeſcalci</hi> ſaith, <hi>Voſſius</hi> was the firſt that charged thoſe Adrumetine Monks to be the author thereof. Yet if I be not deceived, he might be beholding to <hi>Coccius</hi> for helping him to this conceit. But this makes the matter more ſtrange another way, namely that Auſtin ſhould not take notice of this Predeſtinarian Hereſy, ſeeing none was ſo well acquainted with the opinion of thoſe his neighbour Monks, as he, being the man, whom they conſulted about the difference that roſe thereabouts, and wrote two Books there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon and compoſed all. And yet I ſee no reaſon why <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſhould referre it to the Adrumetine Monks hand over head, when as it is cleer by the relation of them, that came over to <hi>Auſtin</hi> to complaine thereof, and to conferre with him thereupon; that they were but few, who were carried away with that errour, whereof they complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56120:36"/>
and that it was but one, that troubled the place of their Monaſtery herein, who was as it were the Ringleader to the reſt; of which <hi>Voſſius</hi> could not be ignorant. And therefore I ſee no cauſe why he ſhould charge them all indifferently, or that party either, who were tainted herewith, as is pretended; ſeeing there was an <hi>Anteſignanus</hi> who led the reſt, of whom <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſpeaks nothing at all; and I ſuppoſe he knew ſome good cauſe why. Beſides, the Predeſtinarian Hereſy is pretended to have riſen <hi>Ab Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtini libris malè intellectis.</hi> Now I find no colour of evidence hitherto, that theſe Monks of Adrumentum, whom <hi>Voſsius</hi> makes the founders of this Hereſy, were led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wry by the miſunderſtanding of Auſtins writings. Neither doth <hi>Voſſius</hi> any where, that I know, take any pains to cleare this. And I would gladly be beholding to this Author, that pretends ſo much zeale unto, and skill in the knowledge of Antiquity, and ſo boldly ſtileth <hi>Lucidus</hi> a Predeſtinarian, for communicating unto us his rare evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences concerning this point, out of his great obſervations. And ſo much the rather, to take mee off from mine errour, who ſince the firſt time that I travelled in the ſearch after this Predeſtinarian Hereſy in dealing with <hi>Corvinus,</hi> which is now ſome three years agoe. I have been apt to conceive that this Hereſy from the firſt, was but a meer fiction of the Pelagians and Semi-Pelagians, cunningly to diſgrace thereby the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of St <hi>Auſtin.</hi> And ſince the coming forth of Dr <hi>Uſhers</hi> Hiſtory in the cauſe of <hi>Godeſcalcus,</hi> I have been confirmed herein; as wherein he gives to underſtand, that whereas <hi>Tyro Proſper</hi> wrote hereof before <hi>Sigibert,</hi> although the Printer hath made him to ſpeak as <hi>Sigibert</hi> doth, namely, that <hi>Haec Haereſis orta eſt ab Auguſtini libris malè intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectis:</hi> yet that is not the language of <hi>Tyro</hi> himſelfe, but plainly this, <hi>Haec Haereſis ab Augustino orta eſt,</hi> and that learned Biſhop hath ſhewed out of two Manuſcripts of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> the one in Bennet Colledge in Cambridge, the other in our Kings Library: and this he farther confirmes by comparing the deſcription which <hi>Gennadius</hi> makes of that, which he calls the Predeſtinatian Hereſy, with the doctrine of <hi>Auguſtin. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cont. Julian. Pelag. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp; de Bono Perſev. cap.</hi> 15. And withall the ſame learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop makes it appeare, that look what doctrine <hi>Sigebertus</hi> aſcribes to the Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, the ſame doctrine was charged upon Auſtin, and ſuch as concurred with him therein. This I ſay that learned Biſhop proves out of the beginning of the 6 Book Hypemneſticon. <hi>Credere nos vel praedicare ſugillatis quod Deus quoſdam hominum ſic praedeſtinet ad vitam regni caelorum, ut ſi nolint or are, aut jejunare, aut in omni opere divino vigiles eſſe, eos om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninò perire non poſſe, nec prorſus ſui debere eſſe ſollicitos quos Deus quia voluit ſemel jam elegendo praedeſtinavit ad vitam: quoſdam verò ſic praedeſtinavit in Gehennae paenam ut etiam ſi credere ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lint, ſi jejuniis &amp; or ationibus, omni<expan>

In the Diſputation at Mompelgard Anno 1586 held between <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Jacobus Andreas</hi> with ſome Seconds on both ſides, <hi>Beza</hi> and his company having diſputed with the Lutherans about the perſon of Chriſt, the Lords Supper &amp;c. When they came to this Point, did decline the ſifting of it, and <note place="margin">

                              <p>The Contra-Remonſtrants alſo in their Conference with their Adverſaries at the Hague in the year 1611 could not be drawn to diſpute with them about this point, but delivered a Petition to the States of Holland and Weſtfrizland that they might not be urged to it, reſolving rather to break off the Conference, then to meddle with it.</p>
                              <p>In the Synod likewiſe of Dort, in the year 1618, and 1619. the Remonſtrants were warned by the Preſident of the Synod <hi>ut de Electione potius quàm de odiosâ Reprobations materiâ agerent,</hi> that they <note place="margin">

                              <p>Can this Doctrine be a truth, and yet bluſh at the light, which makes all thing manifeſt? eſpecially conſidering theſe things.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. That Reprobation is a principall Head of Practicall divinity by the ill, or well ſtating of which, the glory of God, and good of Religion is much promoted, or hindered.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. That there is ſuch a neceſſary connexion between the points of Election and Reprobation (both being parts of predeſtination) that the one cannot well be handled without the other.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. That Reprobation was the chief cauſe of all the uproares in the Church at that time.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. That it was accuſed with open mouth, and challenged of falſhood, and therefore bound in juſtice to purge it ſelfe of the crimination.</p>
                              <p n="5">5. That it may eaſily be defended, if (as ſome ſay) it be ſuch an apparent truth, for <hi>Nihil eſt ad defendendum puritate tutius, nihil ad dicendum veritate facilius,</hi> ſaith S. Hierom.</p>
                              <p>The ſtriving to lye cloſe and hide it ſelfe, though perhaps it be not ſo infallible, yet it is a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable argument of a bad cauſe. Truth covets no corners, but is willing to abide the tryall, whether in men or in doctrines. <hi>David</hi> knowing his heart to be without guile, offers himſelfe ready to the <note place="margin">Pſalm. 139. 23, 24, Ioh. 3. 20, 21.</note> Lords tryall, Search me, o God, and know my heart, try me and know my thoughts, and ſee if there be any wicked way in me. And our Saviour tells us that, Every one that doth evill, hates the light and comes not to the light, leaſt his deeds ſhould be reproved; but he that doth truth, comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God.

                                 <p>VVHo are theſe Authors of this Doctrine, who here are ſaid to have been backward to bring it to the ſtandard? Is <hi>Beza</hi> thoſe Authors? whereof was he the Author? Was it the doctrine of predeſtination as proceeding of the meer pleaſure of God, and not upon foreſight of mans faith and works? Is it not apparent that this was the doctrine of Auſtin 1200 years agoe, and that in oppoſition to the Pelagians and Semi-Pelagians? Or was it the doctrine of reprobation, as not proceeding upon the foreſight of ſinne, but of the meer pleaſure of God? Is this Author ſo ignorant, as not to know what are the concluſions of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez</hi> in the queſtion, Whether there be any cauſe of reprobation on mans part.

                                 <p n="1">1. His firſt Concluſion is this, <hi>Reprobation whereby God decreed not to give unto ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life, and to permit their ſinne, is not conditionate, but abſolute: neither doth it preſuppoſe in God, foreſight of the deſerts of reprobates, or of their perſeverance in ſinne unto the laſt period of their life.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p n="2">2. His next Concluſion is, <hi>In the Angells that fell, there is no cauſe of their reprobation on their part, as touching the whole effect thereof, but before any foreſight of their future ſinne, God, pro ſua Voluntate, of his meer will, did reprobate ſome of them, and ſuffered them to fall into ſinne.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p n="3">3. The third, <hi>Infants departing in Originall ſinne alone, there is no cauſe on their part of</hi>

                                    <hi>reprobation, if they be conſidered in compariſon with others which are not reprobated, and the like is to be ſaid proportionably of men of ripe years.</hi>

                                 <p n="4">4. The fourth, <hi>Not only comparatively, but abſolutely there is no cauſe of reprobation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither ſinne actuall, nor originall, nor both of them foreſeen by God, was indeed the meritorious and motive cauſe of the reprobation of any, as touching all the effects thereof, and the proofe hereof he proſecutes at large.</hi>

                                 <p n="5">5. <hi>Reprobation as touching the laſt effect thereof, preſuppoſeth in ſigno rationis the foreſight of ſinne originall, or actuall, for which a reprobate is damned.</hi> Marke it well, He does not ſay as the cauſe for which God decrees his damnation, but as the cauſe for which a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is damned. And <hi>Aquinas</hi> (whoſe followers the Dominicans are) expreſſeth this doctrine in this manner, and that more Scholaſtically and accurately then <hi>Alvarez. Praeſcientia peccatorum poteſt eſſe aliqua ratio reprobationis ex parte paenae quae praeparatur reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, in quantum ſcilicet Deus proponit ſe puniturum malos propter peccata, &amp;c.</hi> in Ad Rom. 9. Sect. 2. in fine, that is, Preſcience of ſinnes may be ſome reaſon of reprobation on the part of puniſhment, to wit, in as much as God purpoſeth to puniſh wicked men for their ſinnes. Where ſinne is evidently made the cauſe of damnation, and that by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Gods purpoſe, but by no means the cauſe of the decree it ſelfe. And the ſame <hi>Aquinas</hi> elſewhere profeſſeth that, No man was ſo mad as to affirme <hi>that merits are the cauſe of Predeſtination, as touching the act of God Predestinating:</hi> and that it cannot be the cauſe thereof, he proves, becauſe nothing can be the cauſe of Gods will, as touching the act of God willing, but as touching the things willed by God, as formerly he had proved. The ſame doctrine in effect is taught by <hi>Durand</hi> in 1. <hi>diſt.</hi> 41. q. 2. Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture applies the ſame diſtinction to reprobation it ſelfe. <hi>Odium aeternum,</hi> ſaith he, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies two things, <hi>Principale ſignificatum &amp; connotatum &amp;c. &amp; primum non eſt ex meritis, ſed ſecundum.</hi> This he explicates in the words following, <hi>Quod patet ſi reſolvatur, quia Odium eſt propoſitum puniendi: Propoſitum autem nullus meretur ſed paenam,</hi> that is, Hatred (or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation) is Gods purpoſe to puniſh: Of this divine purpoſe there is no meritorious cauſe, but only of the puniſhment. The ſame was the Opinion of <hi>Gandavenſis, Scotus, Halenſis,</hi> as I have ſhewed in my <hi>Vindiciae.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Now judge I pray with how little judgement, or modeſty this Author intimates <hi>Beza</hi> to be the author of the doctrine of abſolute reprobation. Perhaps he will ſay his meaning is, that he was the author of the Upper-way, as touching the making of the object of Predeſtination mankind not yet created. But to this I anſwer, that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> doth ſo indeed, but he was never called to a conference hereabouts, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he never declined it. And that which was declined, he makes to be declined by the abettors, as well as the authors; which cannot be underſtood of this nice and Logicall poynt, as touching the object of reprobation. The main queſtion is, whether there be any cauſe of reprobation, as touching the act of God reprobating: the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative whereof, was maintained very generally amongſt Schoole-Divines before <hi>Beza</hi> was borne. And was it ever known, that thoſe I have named did ſhrink in their heads or decline the triall thereof? What a ſilly thing is it then to inferre, that becauſe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za at ſuch a time, did decline the diſputation hereof, and the Contra-Remonſtrants at another time, therefore it is ſuſpectable to be an untruth? Yet let us examine his inſtances.</p>
                                 <p>Beza he ſaith <hi>did decline the ſifting of this doctrine</hi> (to wit, <hi>of predeſtination)</hi> (for on that they were moved to diſpute.) I doubt this Author ſpeaks by rote, and that he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all acquainted with the ſtory hereof, either in Oſiander or in Beza, but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes only what another hath prompted unto him. For it is apparent by Oſianders Hiſtory, that they did conferre thereof. It is true he ſtood off at the firſt, and gave reaſons for it, but at length he and his fellowes, condeſcended to the inſtance and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of their Adverſaries, and ſo came on to the Conference hereabout, His words are theſe. <hi>Praefat. in</hi> 2. <hi>part.

                                 <p>I come to the Contra-Remonſtrants unwillingneſſe to conferre upon the poynt of reprobation. What their reaſons were I know not. But this I am ſure of, the Scripture is free in ſpeaking of election, and expreſſe; not ſo of reprobation, leaving us to take notice of the condition of reprobation by its oppoſition to election. And in conformity hereunto, both Auſtin in his time, and Remigius in his time, and Bradwardine in his time, ſpeaks liberally of prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, but very ſparingly of reprobation. And the doctrine of reprobation as it is nothing leſſe myſterious then that of election; ſo it is farre more harſh to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall affections. And it is well known that at the time of the Hague Conference, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navelt</hi> that ruled the roſt amongſt the States, was too great a friend to the Arminian Party.</p>
                                 <p>But, what boldneſſe doth this Author take in paſſing his ſuſpicious cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures upon a doctrine, becauſe ſome defenders of it, at ſome time have been loath to come to entertaine a publique Conference thereupon? For what argument call you this, The Contra-Remonſtrants would not be brought to give their reaſons on this point; therefore the doctrine of Auſtin delivered 1200 years (or thereabouts) before, concerning the abſoluteneſſe both of Predeſtination on the one ſide, and of preterition on the other (as <hi>Voſſius</hi> acknowledgeth) is to be ſuſpended of untruth? And if my readineſſe to come to the triall hereon doth nothing credit the cauſe as maintained by others; why ſhould others unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to come to the ſame triall, be any diſparagement to the ſame cauſe, as it is maintained by me or any other? It is well known that <hi>Peter Moulin,</hi> concurring with us in the poynt of abſolute predeſtination, maintaines repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation to proceed upon the divine foreſight of finall perſeverance in impenitency. If this Author differed from us no more the M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                                    <hi>Moulin</hi> doth, and acknowledged the meer pleaſure of God, in giving grace to whom he will, and denying it to whom he will, I doe not think any friend of his would think any whit the worſe of him, or charge him with defection from the truth of God in this. Neither can I think, that he ever was of any other opinion, conſidering how many worthy Divines oppoſite to the Arminians, doe either conceive, or at leaſt ſeem to conceive
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56120:39"/>
that the purpoſe of God to damne, doth preſuppoſe in <hi>ſigno rationis</hi> the foreſight of finall impenitency, yet concurring with us in this, that all are fallen in Adam and ſo brought forth into the world in <hi>damnatâ Maſſà,</hi> as Auſtin calleth it. God of his meer pleaſure cures this naturall corruption (the fruits whereof are infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and impenitency) in ſome, by regenerating them and beſtowing the grace of faith and repentance upon them, and leaves it uncured in others by refuſing to rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate them, to beſtow faith and repentance upon them; We give the hands of Chriſtian fellowſhip, and brotherly amity one unto another, without all exception notwithſtanding ſome nice differences, which in the iſſue I hope, will prove to be meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Logicall, and nothing Theologicall.</p>
                                 <p>Laſtly, however this poynt of unwillingneſſe in ſome, to come to conferre in the poynt of reprobation, might caſt ſome colour of ſuſpicion to the prejudicing of their cauſe; yet leaſt of all did it become this Author to take advantage hereof, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that it is his own caſe, as who declineth not one poynt only, but all the reſt in this his diſcourſe, and cleaves only to that of reprobation, nothing anſwerably (I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume) to <note n="*" place="margin">The Doctor directs his ſpeech unto S. <hi>Nathaniel Rich.</hi>
                                    </note> your expectation, who put this task upon him: and whether it be any thing anſwerable to the promiſe he made unto you, your ſelf are beſt acquainted therewith. Yet becauſe the Remonſtrants hereupon (to wit, upon the Contra-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants declining this Controverſy) have taken liberty to oppoſe the doctrine of the Contra-Remonſtrants in this poynt, ſo farre forth, as they made conſtruction of their opinion hereupon, by their doctrine concerning election; therefore I will not ſpare even here, to digreſſe ſo farre, as to take notice what they delivered, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe an anſwer hereunto, the rather becauſe I find this diſcourſe of theirs inſerted in their Relation of that Conference at Hague.</p>
                                 <p>Now, whereas firſt, by a long deduction upon conſideration of the Contra-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants doctrine in the poynt of election, they doe inferre <hi>Colloq. Hagh. Bertii p.</hi> 120. that like as faith is made by them a fruit of election, ſo infidelity is by them to be made a fruit of reprobation: this conſequence we utterly deny. It only followes herehence, that like as faith, whereby mans naturall infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is cured, is by them made the fruit of election, ſo the denyall of faith, that is, the not curing of mans infidelity, or the leaving of it uncured is the fruit of reprobation. And indeed conſidering the means muſt be his work who intends the end, wherehence it followeth, that look what end God doth intend in mans election, the means tending thereunto muſt be Gods work, as namely, faith; in like ſort, whatſoever be the end which God intends in reprobation, the means tending thereunto, muſt be his work, which cannot be infidelity or ſinne, but the permiſſion of ſinne rather and infidelity, or the not curing of that corruption and infidelity which is naturall unto us all. Hereupon they proceed to propoſe two things to be queſtioned, in congruity to the doctrine of the Contra-Remonſtrants. 1. <hi>Utrumne Fides in conſilio &amp; decreto Dei de electione ad ſalutem, eam ipſam electionem ordine praecedat an verò conſequatur?</hi> 2, <hi>Ex alterâ parte; An Infidelitas in eodem Conſilio &amp; Decreto Dei de reprobatione ad exitium, eam ipſam reprobatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ordine praecedat an ſequatur?</hi> The latter of theſe is only pertinent to our preſent purpoſe; yet ſeeing they handle them both, ſo farre as to diſpute againſt the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their oppoſites in both, and carry themſelves herein <hi>Magnificentiſſimè,</hi> I am content to weigh their arguments, in the ballance of Scholaſticall conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leaſt ſome ſuch as this Author, ſhould affect to ſeem judicious in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting my declining of them to ſavour of ſome inability to encounter them.</p>
                                 <p>Thus therefore they beginne.</p>
                                 <p>If faith followes election unto ſalvation, then alſo the decree of ſending Chriſt as a Saviour into the World, muſt neceſſarily follow that election; But this conſequent is abſurd, and pertains notably to the ignominy of Chriſt.</p>
                                 <p>To this I anſwer. Firſt out of mine own opinion, Thus.</p>
                                 <p>Faith is ſuppoſed to follow Election unto ſalvation, upon no other ground then becauſe the intention of giving faith, is ſuppoſed to follow the intention of giving ſalvation. But this I ſhould deny, and that for this reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this ſubordination is grounded only upon ſuppoſition, that ſalvation is the end which God intends, and faith the means tending unto that end: but this I deny. Firſt, becauſe the end of Gods actions, is not the ſalvation of man,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56120:39"/>
but the manifeſtation of his own glory. <hi>For he made all things for himſelfe,</hi> Pov. 16. 4. and reaſon juſtifies it. For God being the ſupream efficient, muſt be the ſupream end; and being <hi>Optimus</hi> as well as <hi>Maximus,</hi> he muſt needs be both moſt lovely and moſt loving, of that which is moſt lovely, that is, of himſelfe. But becauſe ſome may conceive that though Gods glory be the ſupream end, yet mans ſalvation may be the intermediate end: therefore to this I anſwer; Firſt, let ſuch ſhew then what is the glory of God, which ſalvation of the creature ſetteth forth, and I doubt not, but if that glory be ſtated right, it will appeare, that not ſalvation alone, but ſomething elſe is required to be joyned with it; as namely, the miſſion of Chriſt, yea and faith in Chriſt, to compleat that means, which tend to the procurement of ſuch an end, that is, to the ſetting forth of ſuch a glory. Secondly, the end whether ſupream or intermediate is alwaies ſuch as being rightly underſtood, doth break ſuch a means; but ſalvation is not ſo in reſpect of faith; for it doth not beſpeak it, as is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the ſalvation of Angels, of Infants; as alſo in this, that it was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſible for God to ſave even ſinners without Chriſt, as may be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and I have demonſtrated in my Vind. Grat. Dei. by variety of evident reaſons.</p>
                                 <p>In a word, if Gods ſupream end, were the manifeſtation of his glory on ſome conſidered, as meerely poſſible in doing them good in the higheſt degree, and that in the way of mercy mixt with juſtice, and that <hi>ex Condigno &amp; ex Congruo;</hi> it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that the means required hereunto, and beſpoken hereby, is a body conſiſting of divers particulars, all together compleating the integrall means required here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. For herehence it followeth, that they muſt be both created, without which no glory of God at all can be manifeſted upon them and permitted to ſinne, otherwiſe God could not doe them good in the way of mercy, which ſuppoſeth miſery, but alſo that a Saviour muſt be ſent, and he no leſſe then the Sonne of God, to deſerve the pardon of their ſinne and ſalvation, otherwiſe it could not be in the way of mercy mixt with juſtice <hi>de Condigno:</hi> and faith and repentance muſt be beſtowed on them, otherwiſe the good done them, could not be by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: and laſtly, ſalvation, otherwiſe good could not be done them in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree. And thus in no moment of nature is the Predeſtination of Chriſt either before or after the Predeſtination of man; as our Brittiſh Divines maintained at the Synod of Dort; but at once God predeſtinated both him to be our Head and us his Members; like as <hi>Aquinas</hi> maintained Chriſts predeſtination, and our predeſtination to be one act in God, and conſequently neither could be the cauſe of another.</p>
                                 <p>Thus have I diſpatched mine anſwer unto them, as touching mine own opinion. But ſuppoſing the method of the Contra-Remonſtrants ſound, in making ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of man, to be intended by God as an end, and both mans faith in Chriſt, and Chriſts Miſſion to be intended as means. We deny this to be abſurd or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious unto Chriſt. Lets heare how they prove it, thus; If the decree of ſending Chriſt be poſterior to the electing of ſingular perſons unto ſalvation, then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of mans ſalvation was poſterior to Gods intention of ſatisfaction to his juſtice, which ſay they is abſurd and fooliſh, to wit, to decree the ſalvation of ſinners, unleſſe firſt he decree ſatisfaction to his juſtice. But I anſwer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the forme of the Contra-Remonſtrants doctrine: Firſt, by proving their order to be ſound: Secondly, by ſhewing the invalidity of the Remonſtrants diſcourſe.</p>
                                 <p>Firſt therefore: There was never any other order of intentions acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the learned, then ſuch as is found between the intention of the end, and the intention of the means tending thereunto. And the Order moſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved is this; That the intention of the end, is before the intention of the means. Now let every man that is is his right Witts conſider, which is more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be the end, and which the means of theſe two, Mans ſalvation, and Chriſts Miſſion to ſatisfy for the ſinne of man. Was ever any man known to be ſo brainſick as to affirme, that the ſalvation of man is a means tending to this end, namely, the ſending of Chriſt into the World to ſatisfy for the ſinne of man? On the other ſide, how fair and plauſible is it to affirme, that Chriſt was ſent into the world, to ſatisfy for mans ſinne, to this end, that man might be ſaved? whence it followeth evidently by the moſt approved rules of Schooles, that the intention of mans ſalvation is <hi>in ſigno rationis,</hi> before the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56120:40"/>
intention of ſending Chriſt into the world, to make ſatisfaction for ſinne. Againe, if Chriſts ſending into the world to make ſatisfaction for ſinne, be firſt in intention, then it ſhould be laſt in execution, by rules undeniable, and ſuch as are manifeſt by the very light of nature; Whence it followeth, that man ſhould be firſt ſaved and after that Chriſt ſent into the World, that, by his ſufferings, Gods juſtice might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
                                 <p>Now I come to the conſideration of the Remonſtrants argument. The Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Major we grant, but the Minor we deny. And it is a vaine thing for them to cry out, that it is abſurd and fooliſh to ſay, that the intention of ſalvation, precedes the intention of ſatisfying Gods juſtice; for words muſt not carry it: and it is well known that the moſt empty veſſells give the greateſt ſound. I have ſhewed how abſurd it is to conceive, that man was ſaved to this end, that Gods juſtice may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and that 'tis farre more probable to ſay, That by Chriſts ſufferings, Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice was ſatisfied to this end, that man might be ſaved. For the ſalvation of man we ſay, was not intended by God ſimply, but after a certain manner, to wit, in the way of mercy mixed with juſtice; which end doth not preſuppoſe the permiſſion of ſinne, as theſe Remonſtrants ſhape the matter to varniſh over their conſequence, with ſome colour of probability: but rather it beſpeaks, both the permiſſion of ſinne, and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be made for ſinne, to the end that ſo man might be ſaved, not ſimply, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a certain manner, to wit, in the way of mercy mixed with juſtice. But ſuppoſe they were conſidered as ſinners, Why ſhould the Remonſtrants look ſtrangely upon this doctrine, namely, that God ſhould intend the ſalvation of ſinners <hi>in ſigno rationis,</hi> before he intended that his juſtice ſhould be ſatisfied? For doe not they maintaine, that God by power abſolute, can pardon ſinne without all ſatisfaction? But ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that God will not pardon ſinne without ſatisfaction, in this caſe they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that God muſt firſt intend to take a courſe, that ſuch ſatisfaction may be made, and then intend to ſave. And let them contend but in the name of reaſon, and not of clamours, and content themſelves, with the infatuation of themſelves, with ſuch ſenſeleſſe conceits, and not ſpread this ſcab unto others alſo. My reaſon to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is ſtill the ſame, namely, that if God be pleaſed to ſave ſinners in deſpight of ſinne, in the way of mercy mixt with juſtice, the caſe is cleare, that ſatisfaction for ſinne, is rather a means of mans ſalvation, then mans ſalvation is a means tending to the procurement of ſatisfaction for ſinne, and conſequently the intention of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinners, is in reaſon to precede the intention of procuring ſatisfaction, rather then to follow after it; as the intention of the end, is rather to be accounted before, then after the intention of the means. Yet ſay theſe Remonſtrants, if a man will be ſo obſtinate, as (notwithſtanding the felicity of theſe Remonſtranticall witts in fruitfull inventions and ſubtile argumentations) ſtill to deny that there is any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity herein, thus over and above we prove it. For as yet they have runne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of breath. If, ſay they, <hi>the decree of Chriſt a Saviour, be after the election of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons unto ſalvation, it followeth that God did decree ſome particular mens ſalvation, before he ordained Chriſts merits to procure their ſalvation;</hi> but this is fooliſh and abſurd.</p>
                                 <p>I anſwer, No more fooliſh and abſurd then the former: and indeed every one of theſe conſequences for the expreſſing whereof, they affect to ſeem very inventious, doe ſavour of no invention at all; the Conſequents doe ſo evidently, even every one of them appeare as clearely in the Antecedent, as a mans face in a glaſſe, and are to be accounted rather Tautologies, then deductions, much leſſe doe they relliſh of any ſubtilty of wit. So that all this while, they ſeem to be in travell with nothing but wind, or ſick of the diſeaſe called Tenaſmus, ſtriving mightily to doe ſomewhat, when indeed they doe nothing at all. And our former argument ſtill hath place, and here alſo applied, doth manifeſt, that ſeeing the merits of the ſonne of God are the means of mans ſalvation, then mans ſalvation is the end of Chriſts merits; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all probability, the intention of mans ſalvation, as the intention of the end, ſhould precede the intention of ſending Chriſt to merit as the means, rather then to be ſubordinate unto it. And indeed if the ſending of Chriſt into the World to merit, ſhould be firſt in intention, then ſhould it be laſt in execution; that is, All the elect ſhould firſt be ſaved, and then Chriſt ſhould be ſent into the world to merit their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Therefore to mend the matter (for who is ſo ſilly as not to perceive, that if the conſideration of Chriſts obedience, as ſatisfactory, will not ſerve their turne, ſurely neither will the conſideration of his obedience as meritorious, ſtand them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56120:40"/>
ſtead) they put into this Conſequence another clauſe, without all art, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all honeſty, pretending, that hereby we make ſalvation deſtinated to man, before it is decreed to man: as if we put any difference in this caſe between deſtination and decree, or as if we make ſalvation deſtinated to a man hereby, before it is deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him; whereas we only make the end (that is ſalvation) intended before the merits of Chriſt (which are the means of ſalvation) are intended. And would any man that is in his right witts, ſay this is to make ſalvation deſtinated to a man before it is deſtinated to him? Farther, it is to be obſerved, that we may omit nothing, but take notice of the uttermoſt of their ſtrength, and the rather, becauſe it will notably diſcover either their ignorance, or which is moſt likely, (for as much as they doe not directly inſiſt, as they might upon a new argument farre more plauſible with the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant) their unconſcionableneſſe. For they ſignify that hence it will come to paſſe, that the intention of ſalvation, being before the intention of finding of Chriſt to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſalvation ſhall exiſt, being decreed as preſent to God, before Chriſt is conſidered as he that by his Croſſe hath deſerved it. Now had they ſaid <hi>before Chriſt hath deſerved it,</hi> I ſhould readily have granted it. For I hope none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would deny, that the ſalvation of many a Prophet and Patriarch, exiſted not only before God, but actually and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before Chriſt was crucified. To prevent this eluſion of their argument, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it thus, <hi>Before Chriſt was conſidered as he that hath deſerved it.</hi> Yet here they fall foule upon an indecent expreſſion. For I will be bold to deny, that Chriſt was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by God, as one that had deſerved mans ſalvation, before he had deſerved it. For before he had deſerved it by his Croſſe, to ſay, that God conſidered him as one that had deſerved it, is either to erre or to feigne, neither of which is incident unto God. God conſidered him from everlaſting, as one that in the fulneſſe of time ſhould deſerve it, by ſuffering upon the Croſſe, not as one that had deſerved it. For to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him after the former manner, is to conceive aright, but to conceive him after the latter manner, is to conceive amiſſe. But I will take the pains to mend this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them thus. If their ſalvation were decreed before Chriſts merits, then their ſalvation did exiſt as preſent with God before Chriſts merits did exiſt, as preſent with God. But this is not to be admitted: Now I come to diſcover their ignorance, which they betray in this. Firſt, neither Gods preſcience, nor Gods decree doth make things to exiſt, otherwiſe then in <hi>Eſſe cognito &amp; in eſſe velito;</hi> but this is not to exiſt. Therefore they qualify it by the addition of the manner, <hi>ut praeſens Deo;</hi> which indeed is <hi>Terminus diminuens</hi> in this caſe. For it is preſent to God by vertue of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree intentionally only, and not really, which alo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap>e is to exiſt. But let this Peccadil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio paſſe. Secondly, Who ſeeth not that this argument tends to the utter deſtruction of all diſtinct intentions of end, and means in God? For if there be any ſuch diſtinct intentions in God, the one muſt be acknowledged to be before the other. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, What was the end of creation? Lets goe no farther then the manifeſtation of Gods power and wiſdome as the end thereof. Now hence it will follow by the quaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this argumentation, that the manifeſtation of Gods wiſdome and power in creating the world did exiſt, as preſent with God, before the creation. Is not here a proper argumentation. <hi>Spectatum admiſſi riſum teneatis amici.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Thirdly, to draw neerer to the diſcovery of their ignorance. I grant it ſhall firſt exiſt; but how? Not in duration; We acknowledge no ſuch priority in God, between the intention of the end, and the intention of the means; though ſuch a priority in this caſe is found in man. What then? Ile tell you: They commonly call it a prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of nature. But take heed you doe not apply it to any of the two kindes of prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of nature mentioned by <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> For try if you pleaſe, and you ſhall find that none of them can poſſibly ſerve the turne; What then is this priority of nature ſo called? I anſwer, it is only <hi>Prioritas rationis:</hi> And ſo I formerly ſaid, that the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the end is <hi>in ſigno rationis,</hi> before the intention of the means. You may farther demand, Wherein doth this <hi>Prioritas rationis</hi> conſiſt? I anſwer out of <hi>Durand,</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this, that, <hi>Ratio unius petitur a ratione alterius,</hi> and ſo indeed, <hi>Ratio mediorum petitur a ratione finis.</hi> This generally holds of the intention of end, and means, as well in God, as in the creature. For alwaies the nature of the end duely conſidered, doth beſpeak what ſhall be the condition of the means. So that this makes no priority of exiſtence at all, neither in duration nor in nature properly ſo called, but only ſuch a ſubordination between them, that the reaſon of the one, that is, the nature or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the one, depends upon the nature and condition of the other. Now let any
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56120:41"/>
ſober man judge, Whether the ſalvation of man be required to the procuring of Chriſts merits, and not rather, Chriſts merits are required to the procuring of mans ſalvation; which yet is not true of ſalvation conſidered ſimply, but only as to be beſtowed after a certain manner, to wit, in the way of juſtice, and by way of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made for ſinne, that ſo a man may be ſaved by grace in deſpight of ſinne. In the cloſe of all they ſignify that this of theirs in the laſt place ſeriouſly conſidered will make it appeare, that this doctrine of their Adverſaries, tends notably to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of Chriſts honour, and to the annihilation of Chriſts merits, to wit, unleſſe Chriſts merits be acknowledged the end of mans ſalvation, and not mans ſalvation the end of Chriſts merits, Chriſt ſhall be diſhonoured, and his merits annihilated. Here they are quite out of breath, and that which is wanting, they leave to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the ſerious (they ſhould ſay ignorant) conſideration of their Proſelites. They preſume this colour of diſhonour redounding hereby to Chriſt, will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to blow up their Adverſaries, though it prove of no more force then a ſquibbe. This carriage of theirs calls to my remembrance, a mad prank plaid by the Engliſh at <hi>Delfe,</hi> while they were billeted there, which was told me merrily, by one of the number. One of the Souldiers was billeted in an old Widdowes houſe, and another being a Goldſmith, told him and another conſort of theirs, he had a deviſe to put mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in all their purſes, for he knew how to make a Rex-dolar of three-pence ſylver, and in that Widdowes houſe they would ply their buſineſſe very ſecurely. To work they went, and caſting plates of Tinne to the quantity of one of thoſe Dolars, and ſtamping them full and faire, this Gold-ſmith, with the quantity of three pence ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſylvered them over very fairely, and, leaſt they ſhould ſeem too light, hangs them up in the chimny in a bagge, that the ſmoak might bring them to the ſadder hew. Thus having met with a mine of Sylver in their lodging, one is imployed as a Merchant-man to goe to the Staple of Cloth, and he laies out their coyne in cloth, whereof afterwards they made good ſilver indeed: at length one of them paying a debt of his to a Dutchman in <hi>Delfe,</hi> in one of theſe Rex-dolars, he found the Dutch to betray ſome ſuſpicious geſtures and interpretations upon the coyne. That was a faire warning to an intelligent man of armes; and hereupon they get them packing ing away with all ſpeed; and home they come, and make themſelves merry with the relation. In like ſort theſe Remonſtrants ſhew a great deale of Tinne and traſh in theſe argumentations, and they have not ſo much as three pence ſilver to colour it therewithall to cheat the World, if they will be cheated. But they hope the colour of ſome diſhonour by their adverſaries doctrine redounding unto Chriſt, will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a peece at leaſt of good ſilver. I confeſſe, I am ſomewhat the more merrily diſpoſed at this time, For being taken off from the midſt of a ſentence, by the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous invitation of a Gentleman, to come unto him to his Inne: He was pleaſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine me with ſuch good diſcourſe, that it did not a little refreſh my ſpirits. His reaches were after new diſcoveries for the advancement of learning; and endoctrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me more in one halfe hower, then ſeventeen years ſtudy in the Univerſity. For whereas I never learned there, more cauſes then foure, he was pleaſed to acquaint me with nine; which I took ſome pains to learn without book, and they were theſe, Matter, Forme, Workman, Will, Power, Time, Finding out, Accident, End. And moſt courteouſly offered himſelfe to enlarge on every one of them; but having left off at a broken ſentence, I was deſirous to return to my ſtudies Theologicall, and to let thoſe Philoſophicall progreſſes alone. But I proteſted unto him ſeriouſly, that he had informed me more in the number of cauſes in a ſhort ſpace, then <hi>Oxford</hi> had done in many years; he entreated I would conſider of them, and I promiſed I would, and conferre of them too, with all the Schollers I companied with; which he took in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry goo part; and ſo I took my leave. And finding my ſpirit not a little elevated with this recreation, I reſolved, forbearing my uſuall time of ſupper, to follow theſe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies cloſe that night, which truly fell out very happily. For one of thoſe cauſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>found out,</hi> otherwiſe called, Invention (as for Judgement, I doe not remember that it was admitted into the number) I made uſe of it very happily in finding out, or diſcovery of the foppery of theſe Remonſtranticall argumentations.</p>
                                 <p>Now I proceed to the ſecond Queſtion, as more ſeaſonable to the preſent occaſion. And here firſt they begin with their former artifice, making infidelity on the part of reprobation, anſwerable to faith on the part of election, which is moſt untrue, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I ſhewed: Only the not curing of infidelity by the grace of faith, is made by
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56120:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
us ſubordinate to reprobation; as the curing of naturall infidelity by the grace of faith, is made by us ſubordinate to election. But they goe on, as in ſhaping our Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent at pleaſure, ſo in baſting it with their very liberall cenſures, as <hi>abſurd and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> in ſuch ſort, as <hi>the bare commemoration of it,</hi> they take to be ſufficient to repreſent the horrour of it, and to confute it, <hi>and this they commit to the judgement of all the faithfull of Chriſt.</hi> And indeed their beſt ſtrength lyeth in ſetting forth their Adverſaries doctrine in ſuch colours, as the Devill is painted with. And in this particular, they conceive good hope (no doubt) that propitious Readers will conceive hereby, that the infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of man is made by their Adverſaries the work of God, as well as Faith; Whereas it is well known, that there is ſo little need of working men to infidelity, that all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borne in ſinne, and corrupted and eſtranged from the life of God, through the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> infidelity is as naturall and hereditary to a man, as any other corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And it is as well known and undeniable, that none can cure it but God, by faith; but this he cures in whom he will, by giving Faith to whom he will, and if he refuſe to cure it in any, that, and that alone is enough to make him a veſſell of wrath, that ſo Gods glory may be manifeſted upon him, in the way of juſtice vindicative. But come we to their Arguments.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. The firſt is this. <hi>If Infidelity followeth Reprobation unto deſtruction, then God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in justice deſtroy Reprobates for their infidelity. For there is no greater inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, then to deſtroy a man for that, that followeth neceſſarily upon reprobation which is the work of God.</hi> To this I anſwer.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. According to mine ordering the decrees divine. Secondly, according to the Contra-Remonſtrants Tenent in ordering them.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. According to my ordering of the decrees divine; In no moment of nature or reaſon is the decree of damnation precedent to the decree of permitting infidelity, or leaving the infidelity of ſome men uncured, to wit, by denying them faith, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grace of regeneration. But the decrees of creating all in <hi>Adam,</hi> of permitting all to fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> in bringing all men forth into the World in the ſtate of Originall ſinne, of leaving this originall ſinne uncured in them, and laſt of all, of damning them for their ſinnes; are decrees not ſubordinate, but coördinate, as decrees <hi>de Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is,</hi> tending joyntly to one ſupream end, which is the manifeſtation of Gods glory upon them in the way of juſtice vindicative; as alſo to ſhew the riches of his glory upon the veſſels of mercy, whom he hath prepared unto glory, to wit, by beholding <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 22.</note> in others that miſerable condition, which through Gods meer grace and goodneſſe they have eſcaped.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. According to the Contra-Remonſtrants Tenent, I anſwer,</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. Many of them doe not maintaine that infidelity is conſequent to the decree of damnation, but in the foreſight of God, precedent rather: as appears by the Brittiſh Divines their <hi>Theſes De Reprobatione;</hi> and <hi>Alvarez</hi> profeſſeth the ſame. The denyall of grace, and ſo the permitting of naturall infidelity to remain uncured, they make conſequent (as it ſeems) to a negative decree of denying glory. And to the decree of permitting infidelity, they make the foreſight of infidelity ſubſequent; and this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of infidelity they make precedent to reprobation, as it ſignifies the decree of damnation. And thus farre I agree with them, That in no moment of nature, or ſigne of reaſon did God ordain any man to damnation, but for ſinne; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in no moment of nature, or ſigne of reaſon, did the decree of damnation goe before the foreſight of ſinne or infidelity.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. But ſuppoſe, as theſe Remonſtrants collect and pick out their meaning, They make the decree of reprobation, in all poynts proportionable to the decree of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that like as the decree of giving faith, they conceive to be ſubordinate to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of ſalvation; ſo the decree of permitting infidelity, or denying faith (for herein conſiſts the juſt proportion, and not as they feigne it, between faith on the one ſide, and infidelity on the other) is with them made ſubordinate to the decree of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Then I anſwer,</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. Their Conſequence ſhould be this, <hi>If the permiſſion of Infidelity followeth the decree of damnation, then God cannot in juſtice damne them for Infidelity.</hi> Now here is no colour of good Conſequence.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. If they reply, That in caſe infidelity followeth neceſſarily upon Gods permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, the Conſequence is as good as in caſe infidelity followed upon reprobation. For even hereby it appears, that infidelity followeth upon reprobation though not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56120:42"/>
immediately, but by the mediation of the divine permiſſion thereof; but whether it followeth mediately or immediately all is one, as touching the force of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Reſp.</hi> Now to this I Reply, Granting that all is one, as touching the force of the Conſequence: but then conſider.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. All the force of the argument depends not upon the conſequution of infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſimply unto the decree of damnation, but only upon the neceſſary conſequuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof. And yet no mention at all was made hereof, in the Conſequence of the Major, but it is brought afterwards over and above moſt illogically.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. In this caſe all the force of the Conſequence depends upon the neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequution of ſinne in generall, or infidelity in ſpeciall, upon Gods permitting of it.</p>
                                 <p>So that whether Gods decree to permit the ſinne of infidelity, be antecedent or conſequent to the decree of damnation all is one. Yet theſe Remonſtrants make the force of their argument, to conſiſt only in the ſubordinating of the decree divine, as touching the permiſſion of infidelity to the decree of damnation, which yet appears by this to be of no force.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. But if they hereupon take a new courſe of argumentation, and diſpute thus; <hi>If Infidelity followeth neceſſarily upon Gods permitting of it, then God cannot in juſtice damne a man for Infidelity;</hi> pretending no injuſtice to be greater, then to damne a man for that which followeth neceſſarily upon permiſſion, which is Gods work.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Reſp.</hi> I anſwer.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. That thus their former argumentation is caſhierd as unprofitable.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. We deny this Conſequence; and call in no meaner name then Arminius him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to beare us out in this our deniall. Who expreſſely profeſſeth, That in caſe God permits a man, <hi>Velle peccatum, neceſſe eſt ut nullo argumentorum genere perſuadeatur ad nolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum. Exam. pag.</hi> 153. I could adde <hi>Vorſtius</hi> alſo, herein concurring with <hi>Piſcator, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> and <hi>Navarrettus</hi> the Dominican is as expreſſely in this as any other; as alſo in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinating it to the decree of reprobation. Arminius likewiſe profeſſeth faith and repentance, <hi>Niſi Deo dante haberi non poſſe. Exam.</hi> 57. and that both of them are denied to the reprobates by the decree of reprobation. See his own words, <hi>At Deus ſtatuit decreto reprobationis reprobis fidem &amp; paenitentiam non dare. Concedo lubens, illam aſſumptionem, ſed rectè intellectam:</hi> He laboureth to charme this inconvenient grant of his, but no charme will ſerve to keep this adder, from ſtinging and wounding their doctrine of reprobation unto death. He ſaith, Faith is given by way of ſuaſion. We ſay, that matters nothing; for ſo it be given by God whereſoever it be found, and ſo it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to reprobates by the decree of reprobation, we deſire no more. We our ſelves acknowledge, that faith is not given to the elect, but by way of ſwaſion, the Word working faith, running in this manner; Repent and believe the Goſpel; and whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believeth ſhall be ſaved. For God hath ſet forth his Sonne to be a Propitiation for our ſinnes, through faith in his bloud.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. At length he proceeds in his charming courſe, but moſt unſucceſſefully, as whereby his former ſaying is nothing charmed. His care rather ſeems to be to eat his own words, as Satan devoured his own children. For diſtinguiſhing ſuaſion into that which is ſufficient, and that which is effectuall: this effectuall ſuaſion, he confeſſeth to be adminiſtred by the decree of election; but as for that ſufficient ſuaſion, though withall he accounts it allwaies ineffectuall, yet he ſaith it is adminiſtred by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of providence, not by the decree of reprobation. At length he confeſſeth, that by the decree of reprobation is denied grace effectuall, that is ſuch a grace as whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he foreſaw they would believe. Now herein I appeale to the judgement of every ſober man. Take we two men into conſideration, the one elect as <hi>Paul,</hi> the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate as <hi>Eſau.</hi> Of two ſufficient graces, the Lord foreſeeth which of them will prove effectuall with <hi>Paul,</hi> and which ineffectuall; and he makes choice to give him ſuch a grace, as he foreſeeth will prove effectuall. Again he foreſeeth of two ſufficient graces, which of them will prove effectuall with <hi>Eſau</hi> and which ineffectuall, and makes choice to afford him only that which he knowes will prove ineffectuall. Now what can be the reaſon hereof, but becauſe he purpoſeth to ſhew his mercy in the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the one, and his juſtice in the damnation of another. Before Arminius came to this reſolution, as expreſſely to profeſſe, That by the decree of reprobation is denyed grace effectuall, he found himſelfe in a ſtreit upon his diſtinction of grace

ſufficient and effectuall, and the deſcription of each; he drew his breath very ſhort; and therefore to get, as it were, more liberty of ayre, he concluded that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with, <hi>Haec ex Auguſtini ſententiâ dicuntur. pag.</hi> 58. and in the next page. <hi>Hiſce autem ita explicatis ex mente Auguſtini &amp; fortè Scripturae ſenſu.</hi> But, What, a miſchiefe, doth this great Doctor mean to tell us? Firſt, that he willingly grants that, <hi>Deus ſtatuit decreto reprobationis reprobis fidem &amp; paenitentiam non dare</hi> (provided it be well underſtood) and after all this explication, tells us, that all this explication of his is delivered <hi>ex ſententiâ &amp; mente Auguſtini,</hi> and but perchance, <hi>ex Scripturae ſenſu,</hi> concealing all the while what is his own Opinion. Is this to give us the right underſtanding of that Aſſertion <hi>(Deus ſtatuit decreto reprobationis repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis fidem &amp; paenitentiam non dare)</hi> moſt prejudiciall to his own Tenent at firſt fight, and much more by the diſtinction following of <hi>Gratia ſufficiens &amp; efficax;</hi> which he ſo well perceived, that he is content to clap it upon <hi>Auſtins</hi> back to beare the burthen of it; and puts it but upon adventure, that it may prove to be the Scripture meaning.

The like to have been the courſe of other Arminians, I have known, declining the point of effectuall grace, as a precipice and breakneck unto them: And when others have been put upon it, they have placed it in the grace ſubſequent, and have not been aſhamed to make it conſiſt in this, that God by effectuall grace, doth work in man, <gap reason="foreign">

                                 <p n="4">4. Let the argument ſtand as it doth, let infidelity by Gods permiſſion follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the decree of damnation, and that neceſſarily. Yet conſider.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. Gods permitting of it, is no other then the leaving of it uncured: not that hereby infidelity followeth, which was not before; but being in all before, as the fruit of that naturall corruption wherein all were borne, as all confeſſe, as many as concurre againſt the Pelagians, in acknowledging Originall ſinne. By Gods permiſſion of it, it continueth to be uncured; What actuall ſinne is there in the World, or habituall ſinne ariſing thereupon, which God cannot cure if it pleaſe him? If then he will not cure it in ſome, ſhall it not be lawfull for him to puniſh it, where he findes the continuance of it unto the end, without breaking off by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. Suppoſe all men had power to doe any good thing; if God will not give them <hi>Velle quod poſſunt</hi> (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith he dealt with <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency, and gave the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that ſtood, <hi>amplius Adjutorium,</hi> then he gave the others; whereby it came to paſſe, that they ſtood in obedience when the other fell) what ſhall wee ſay in this caſe, is it poſſible that they ſhould <hi>Velle bonum,</hi> if God will not work it in them, of whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle profeſſeth, that he works in us both the Will and the Deed? Or ſhall wee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſay, they doe not ſinne freely? What ſhift have they to avoyd this, but either by contradicting the Apoſtle, and ſaying God doth not work in us <gap reason="foreign">

                                    <hi>Velle, modò Velimus,</hi> as plain a contradiction as ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the mouth of any, The ſelfe ſame act, being made before and after it ſelf; for the condition is allwaies before the thing conditioned. And is this to work in us the Will according to Gods pleaſure, or according to mans good pleaſure? What is it to ſay, that grace is given according unto works, if this be not?</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. We deny, that any evill act therefore comes not to paſſe freely, becauſe it comes to paſſe neceſſarily, upon ſuppoſition of Gods denyall of grace, to refraine from it. For like as good works, are not therefore not wrought
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56120:43"/>
freely by us, becauſe God by his grace workes us to the performance of them; (For who dares deny that it is in Gods power to make us work this or that freely) in like ſort, and much more, evill works are not done the leſſe freely, becauſe God denies ſpeciall and effectuall grace to abſtain from them. For, want of grace doth not take away willingneſſe unto that which is evill, but leaves too much rather in man of that kind. As <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Libertas ſine gratiâ non eſt libertas ſed contumacia.</hi> Now where there is contumacy, there is rather too much will then too little. For Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy is Wilfulneſſe.</p>
                                 <p n="4">4. The Schooles teach, that liberty of will conſiſts only, <hi>in electione mediorum,</hi> in the election of means to certain ends. Now when the Goſpel is preached to a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man, whoſe ends are only carnall, as the Apoſtle ſaith, Philip. 3. 20. <hi>They mind earthly things;</hi> ſo farre forth as he ſhall find it ſerviceable to his carnall ends, he may believe it and make profeſſion of it, as many times Hypocrites doe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in ſuch ſort, as it is hard to diſtinguiſh, between a true and an Hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call profeſſour. This moved the Apoſtle to exhort the Corinthians, famous for their faith, to examine themſelves, and prove themſelves, Whether they were in the faith, that is, <hi>in faith unfaigned.</hi> For there is not only a groſſe Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, whereunto a mans own heart is privy, but a ſecret Hypocriſy whereof the man himſelfe is nothing conſcious; yet ſuch a faith undoubtedly is performable by a naturall man. Now when a man rejects the Goſpell, the faith and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof he finds nothing ſerviceable to his carnall ends, doth he not judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and deliberately, yea and wiſely too (according to the wiſdome of fleſh and bloud) reject it?</p>
                                 <p n="5">5. <hi>Auſtin</hi> profeſſeth <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>De Gen. contr. Manich. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>That all men may believe if they will,</hi> and juſtifies it in his Retractations. But if the will of man be corrupt, and averſe from believing, We juſtly ſay, ſuch a man cannot believe; as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>How can you believe that receive honour one of another, and ſeeke not the honour that cometh of God alone.</hi> Joh. 5. 44. yet this is an impotency Morall only, which is to be diſtinguiſhed from impotency Naturall. For notwithſtanding this, it may be truely ſaid, that, All men may believe if they will, and herein conſiſts the naturall liberty of the will. The Morall liberty conſiſts, rather in a ſanctified inclination unto that which is good, whereby it is freed from the power of ſinne and Sathan; then in a power to doe good if they will, and not otherwiſe. But I never find that Arminians doe diſtinguiſh theſe.</p>
                                 <p n="6">6. It is not ſufficient for Arminians to conclude, that ſuch a thing upon ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion comes to paſſe neceſſarily, therefore it comes not to paſſe freely.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. For upon ſuppoſition that God decreed to create the World, the creation of the World came to paſſe neceſſarily; yet ſimply the World was made by God freely.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. In like ſort, upon Gods foreknowledge that ſuch a man will not believe it followeth neceſſarily, that ſuch a one will not believe; and ſo the like may be ſaid of the moſt free act that is performed. But will it follow herehence, that it is not done freely?</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. In like ſort upon the denyall of an effectuall impediment of ſinne, unto a man it followeth neceſſarily, that ſuch a man will ſinne, according to Arminius his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and this holds applied to any particular ſinne whatſoever. But will it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence follow according to Arminius, that ſuch a ſinne is not committed freely? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothing leſſe.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. The Remonſtrants ſecond argument is this.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>What God cannot performe that God cannot will. But God cannot damne a man for infidelity flowing from ſuch a decree of Reprobation.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. But who ſaith that infidelity floweth from the decree of reprobation? Not one that I know, but <hi>Piſcator</hi> upon theſe words, Yee therefore heare not my words, becauſe yee are not of God. But underſtand him aright, it is as if he <note place="margin">John 8. 47.</note> ſhould ſay, Therefore ſuch a man goeth lame, becauſe the Phyſitian will not cure him: yet it is well known the cauſe of his lameneſſe is from within, and perhaps procured by ſome diſtemper of his own: yet in caſe a Surgeon could cure him and will not, he may be ſaid to be the cauſe of lameneſſe; but how? <hi>per modum non removentis.</hi> This is well known by the learned to be a kind of cauſe whereof notice is taken in Naturall Philoſophy. And in this ſenſe and no other,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56120:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it is well known that <hi>Piſcator</hi> makes God the cauſe of infidelity, and that according to the expreſſe Word of God. But in my judgement <hi>Piſcator</hi> miſtakes the phraſe, <hi>To be of God,</hi> which he conceives to denote election. I rather take it to denote regeneration, as much as to ſay, <hi>yee therefore he are not my words,</hi> becauſe God hath not hitherto by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation cured that naturall infidelity which is in you.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. But take the argument according to the former expreſſion, God cannot damne a man for that infidelity which is conſequent to reprobation; And then my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the former argument in every particular thereof, may be accommodated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. The Third followeth. <hi>If Infidelity flowes from reprobation, then God can neither require Faith of reprobates, nor ſeriouſly offer ſalvation unto them, but neceſſarily counterfeit. For it is manifeſt Hypocriſy, to invite thoſe unto faith and ſalvation, who are excluded from both by the decree of God.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. Here again Infidelity is made to flow from reprobation; whereas nothing flowes from reprobation by the doctrine of the Contra-Remonſtranes, but the not curing of mans naturall infidelity, like as the curing of it by faith, is that which flows from election.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. I ſay, There is no ſimulation at all of God in this. For that wich he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth is but this, that, <hi>Whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved, and Whoſoever believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> He ſends his Miniſters to Preach this, and to Beſeech them to believe, and to be reconciled unto God, yea, all they meet with. But for whoſe ſake? Not for the reprobates ſake, but for the elects ſake, Who becauſe they are mixed among re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, and God hath not revealed to his Miniſters, Who are elect and who are not (as neither was it fit he ſhould, many of the Miniſters themſelves, even of thoſe that not only prophecyed in his name, but caſt out Devills, being reprobates) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was fit their Commiſſion ſhould be generall to Preach to all. Yea, did not the Apoſtles themſelves take notice of this? Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſe that, He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <note place="margin">2 Corinth. 6.</note> all things to all that he may ſave ſome? And who were thoſe ſome, but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry elect of God, as the ſame Apoſtle elſewhere profeſſeth, ſaying, <hi>I ſuffer all things for the elects ſake.</hi> And doth not <hi>Auſtin</hi> profeſſe that if we knew who were reprobate, <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 10.</note> we would no more pray for them, then for the Devills? De Civit. Dei lib. 21. cap. 24.</p>
                                 <p n="4">4. The Fourth and laſt. <hi>If Incredulity followes the decree of reprobation, then God conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the reprobates in his counſell of reprobation, either as creatable, or as created in the state of innocency, or as falne into Originall ſinne. Sed falſa ſunt haec omnia. All theſe things are falſe. And theſe things, he ſaith, are delivered, contra abſurdam, deteſtabilem, at<expan>

                                 <p n="1">1. Yet as I ſaid, All this nothing toucheth them, Who albeit they maintaine that God of his meer pleaſure, hath mercy on ſome, giving them faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (conſidering all in the corrupt Maſſe) and of his meer pleaſure hardens others (no worſe in nature then the former) by denying them faith and repentance, yet as reprobation ſignifies the decree of damnation, doe permit thereunto the foreſight of finall perſeverance in ſinne.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. According to my Ordering of Gods decrees, Who conceive mankind not yet created to be the object of all Gods decrees, they being eternall, and but one act in God, and that act his very Eſſence, and all other things being temporall. I doe not maintain that the decree of damnation, is in any moment of nature or reaſon, before the conſideration of mans finall impenitency. As neither doe I conceive it to be after this, but both ſimultaneous; for as much as the decree of permitting all to fall in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> together with the decree of finall leaving ſome therein, and the decree of damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for ſinne, I take not to be ſubordinate, but coordinate and ſimultaneous.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. Whether we take the Firſt-way for ſhaping the object of predeſtination, or the Second, or the Third, I Anſwer.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. The difference hereabout is in my judgement meerly Logicall, nothing Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall; the reſolution whereof according to generall rules, is eaſily made by light of nature, if once it be agreed upon in Divinity, What is Gods end both on the part of election, and on the part of reprobation, and what are the means that tend unto thoſe ends.</p>
                                 <p n="2">

2. Which way ſoever we take of the Three, I never found any reaſon given by Arminians of any force to take us from it, as I have juſtified in my <hi>Vindiciae,</hi> as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Firſt-way; And in my Examination of the Conference between Arminius and Junius, as touching the Second-way; And in my Anſwer to <hi>Corvinus</hi> againſt <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus,</hi> as touching the Third-way, and therein, I truſt, routed and profligated the 20 Reaſons of Arminius, propoſed againſt the Firſt and Laſt-way, but chiefly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Firſt, in the Declaration of his Opinion before the States.</p>
                                 <p>Now I returne to the Author of this diſcourſe, and to the remainder of his ſecond Motive, from whence I have digreſſed.</p>
                                 <p>I was here paſſing over unto the third inſtance, to wit, of the proceedings in the Synod of Dort; but upon my looking into the Hiſtory thereof, to prepare my ſelfe for an anſwer thereunto, ere I was a ware, I lighted upon the reaſons of that the Contra-Remonſtrants motion to be ſpared, preferred unto the State. And they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny what is here caſt upon them, namely, that they deprecated at all, that they might be ſpared from conferring upon the poynt of reprobation. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Remonſtrants had incumbred the point of election and reprobation with ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Queſtions, which pertained not to the ſtate of the Controverſy concerning the firſt Article, and being alſo imperfect and intricate for the moſt part, and propoſed to this end, to draw their Adverſaries away from the true ſtate of the Queſtion; They deſired to be ſpared from anſwering unto them. And upon this Petition of theirs it pleaſed the States, that leaving thoſe thorny queſtions, they ſhould come to the handling of the Articles. This is ſet down in the Preface to thoſe <hi>Acta Synodalia,</hi> ſet forth by the Authority of the States. Fol. 10. pag. 1. For after the propoſing of theſe two queſtions to the Remonſtrants, as touching the decree of Predeſtination. 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the intire decree of Predeſtination were contained in this Article, namely, That God did from everlaſting decree to ſave believers, which no man denies. 2.

Yet I thought good to enquire into the truth of the fact here mentioned; and I find it in the page men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and how the Remonſtrants themſelves doe expreſſe this, even as here it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, thus, <hi>A Reverendo Praeſide moniti ſumus ut à negativis enunciationibus abſtineremus &amp; de electione potius quàm odioſâ reprobationis materiâ ageremus.</hi> Yet I confeſſe this did not ſatisfy me; For why ſhould this Author make choyce to expreſſe it in the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants termes, rather then in the words of the Preſident himſelfe.

                                 <p>Now albeit for the diſcovery of the vile vanity of this concluſion, I need take no other pains, then to appeal to your, or any ſober mans due conſideration of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes duely examined according to my former anſwer; yet I think good not to paſſe it over without ſuch particular conſideration as it deſerves. Firſt, I pray conſider, what is that light that makes all things manifeſt? Is it the light of Conference? In the Conference of <hi>Mompelgard</hi> there were diverſe other things diſputed of, beſides this of predeſtination. Now is the truth manifeſted hereby in all thoſe particulars? If it be, I pray, let him ſignify on whoſe ſide, whether on the part of <hi>Jacobus Andreas,</hi> or on the part of <hi>Beza?</hi> To whom is it made manifeſt? To either ſide, or only to that ſide, on whoſe ſide this Author conceives the truth to ſtand? Doe you not manifeſtly perceive the crudity of this conceit? Nay, who ſeeth not, that it is not the condition of conference, but the quality rather and ability of the conferrers, that is apt to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the truth. And ſuch men are able to manifeſt, as well out of conference in their diſcourſes, either Poſitive, or Controverſiall, as in conference; yea, and farre better; Thoſe diſcourſes being more quietly carried, and more free from altercation, then conferences; eſpecially in caſe they meet with malignant oppoſites. And indeed it is the Word of God alone, which is that ſpirituall light, which giveth manifeſtation to all ſpirituall truth. And conſequently neither are they to be cenſured as bluſhing at the light, that prefer to write quietly of theſe controverſies, then to conferre about them in ſome caſes; or that preferre conference by the penne as <hi>Beza</hi> did, before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference by word of mouth, though this better pleaſed the lipps of <hi>Jacobus Andreas.</hi> Yet neither <hi>Beza</hi> did refuſe to yeeld to <hi>Andreas</hi> his own way, neither did either the Contra-Remonſtrants at the Haghe Conference, or the Divines of Dort, refuſe to treat of reprobation, as well as election, as formerly I have ſhewed by authenticall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences. But ſuppoſe <hi>Beza</hi> and his fellowes, whether two or three had altogether declined to conferre at all, as in my judgement they had good reaſon to refuſe, muſt this be cenſured their bluſhing at the light? <hi>Auſtin</hi> profeſſeth as I have formerly vouched him, that there may be many cauſes of forbearing to deliver the truth at ſome times. He little dreamed of expoſing the truth thereby to ſuch a cenſure, as if it bluſhed at the light. And if ſome few might be juſtly cenſured as bluſhing at the light, muſt all for their ſakes, by the rules of juſtice, be made obnoxious to the ſame cenſure, and not the Doctors only, but the Doctrine it ſelfe? Is it not apparent that a true and ſound doctrine, may be weakly apprehended by many, though learned, and <hi>Veritas eſt temporis filia,</hi> and the accurate handling and maintaining of the truth
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56120:45"/>
in plainer points then this of reprobation, comes not to perfection, but by degrees, and after much ventilating of it in a ruder manner. Thus I think I have crackt the crowne of this concluſion; I may proceed with the greater facility to the reſt.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. That Reprobation is an Head to any part of practicall Divinity, I never read, nor heard till now. But yet in every theoreticall poynt, as touching the nature of God and his attributes, by the true doctrine thereof, the glory of God, and good of Religion is promoted, &amp; by the erronious doctrine thereabouts it is as much impaired. For like as it is blaſphemy, to attribute that unto God, which doth not become him; ſo is it blaſphemy alſo, to deny unto him that which doth become him. As for the entertaining or refuſing conference thereabouts, I have already ſpoken ſufficiently; yet two particulars more I have to deliver, which I purpoſe to ſubjoyne to the end of thoſe five conſiderations here diſtinguiſhed, as remarkable ones, if my memory failes me not.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. A Connexion I grant there is, between election and reprobation, and the clearing of the truth in the one, doth give light unto the other. But which of theſe is to be handled firſt, that the clearing of the truth therein, may give light to the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the other, I ſhould think no ſober man would make queſtion. Yet the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants at the Synod of Dort, were eager to begin with Reprobation, but were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in generally cenſured by the conſent of forraine Divines that aſſiſted there. But that one of them cannot be handled without the other, is a palpable untruth, as appears by the very practice of this Author himſelfe, and his own carriage in this buſineſſe. For he undertakes only the poynt of reprobation.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. As touching the third particular, in charging the doctrine of reprobation, with being the chiefe cauſe of all the uproares in the Church at that time; this author takes to himſelfe a ſtrange liberty of diſcourſe. We read and heare of no ſmall ſtirres in the Church of Rome, between the Dominicans and the Jeſuits; but I never read that the Jeſuits laid to the Dominicans charge, that their Doctrine as touching the predetermination of the creatures will to every act thereof, was the cauſe of any up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare in the Church of Rome: But to the contrary rather. I read that in the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Dominicans and Jeſuits in Rome it ſelfe, wherein <hi>Valentianus</hi> through ſome heat in diſputation, caught a feaver whereof he dyed within three daies after; of the relation whereof, made by one <hi>Pet</hi> (that had been a Prieſt) in Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford I was ſometimes an eare witneſſe. The Jeſuits were rather taxed for their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodoxy in the poynt <hi>de auxiliis,</hi> as <hi>Petrus Mattheus</hi> in his Hiſtory reports it. And from D. <hi>Jacksons</hi> mouth, I have heard what a Spaniard ſhould deliver upon the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Molina</hi> the Jeſuit, namely, that he was the man, <hi>qui tantos tumultus excitavit,</hi> to wit, in Spain. But as for Churches Proteſtant, he doth well to limit his crimination to a certain time. For the ſtirre that was raiſed by <hi>Huberus</hi> in the Lutheran Churches, was neither cauſed nor occaſioned by our doctrine concerning reprobation. <hi>Huberus</hi> his cauſe was, a pertinacious ſtanding for an univerſall Election. It ſeems he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation only to the Haghe conference, and the uproares, as he calls them, amongſt the States only, and their particular, or provinciall congregations alone (as it ſeems) he denominates the Churches. Now let us conſider, Who made thoſe uproares, were they the Contra-Remonſtrants, or the Remonſtrants only? If he chargeth this upon the Contra-Remonſtrants, let him prove it, leaſt he be juſtly cenſured for one of thoſe wild beaſts, an Emperour was ſometimes warned to beware of, they were the ſlanderers. If the Remonſtrants were the authors of theſe uproares, how doth he prove that the doctrine of reprobation, was the chiefe cauſe of them, Were not thoſe Arminians voluntary agents in thoſe uproares? If they conceived their oppoſites do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be unſound, could they not oppoſe it without uproares, without violent proceedings? Againe, their oppoſites doctrine, was it never received or preached 'till thoſe daies? Or was there any uproare made thereupon, 'till Arminius his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating? And is that the chief cauſe of an uproare, which hath no ſuch conſequent enſuing untill it meets with ſome turbulent ſpirits, which begin to ſtirre as innovators in a Church or State. And yet was reprobation that alone, whereupon they ſtirred? Is it not apparent, that about the five Articles commonly ſo called, they conferred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like? But he ſaith it was the chiefe cauſe, and only ſaith it, yet <hi>Molinaeus</hi> profeſſing reprobation to proceed, upon foreſight of finall impenitency, as in truth it cannot be denied, but that as the Contra-Remonſtrants profeſſed, as well in that Conference at the Hague, as in the Synod of Dort, that God did never intend to damne any man
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56120:46"/>
of ripe years, but for finall perſeverance in infidelity and impenitency. Did their contentions hereupon, either totally ceaſe or in part? But ſuch criminations are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtrange. We know after what manner of greeting wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> ſaluted the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet <hi>Elijah. Art thou he that troubleth Iſrael?</hi> but he ſpared not to anſwer him, <hi>I am not he that troubleth Iſrael, but Thou and thy Fathers houſe.</hi> In the like manner were <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> entertained <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 20. when being caught and brought before the Magiſtrates, heard ſuch an accuſation made againſt them, <hi>Theſe men which are Jewes trouble our citty: and preach Ordinances which are not lawfull for us to receive, neither to obſerve, ſeeing we are Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> And no marvaile if the Devill roares, when he falls from heaven, like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and his kingdome is ſhaken. But becauſe he putts us to it in this crimination, I think it fit to give a taſt of the violent proceedings in thoſe parts, as I find them or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the Preface to the Synod. <hi>Dordrac.</hi> ſet forth by the authority of the States. And becauſe uproares concern inſurrections againſt government in Church or State; The firſt particular I obſerve of this nature is, Fol. 3. pag. 1. where after Arminius had been much ſuſpected, and divers times urged to declare his opinion, upon certain poynts which hitherto he had declined, ſaving in a falſe manner, his proteſtation in the iſſue, proving directly contrary to his practice. The Rectors of particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſowred with the leaven of his doctrine, openly refuſe to ſubſcribe the Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Catechiſme, though the Synod of South-Holland commanded them. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores Arminii ſententiam amplexi paſſim in Claſſibus recuſabant mandato Synodi de ſubſcriptione Confeſſion is, ac Catecheſeos morem gerere.</hi> Here we have the begining of a manifeſt ſchiſme.

But he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth they had great cauſe to ſuſpect the Remonſtrants differed from them in greater points of moment. And theſe are afterwards declared to be theſe, Fol. 14. pag. 1. <hi>De perfectâ Chriſti pro peccatis Satisfactione, de Juſtificatione hominis coràm Deo, de Fide Salvificâ, de Peccato Originali, de Certitudine ſalutis, &amp; de Perfectione hominis in hâc vitâ.</hi> And whereas, they deſired the Remonſtrants would deale clearly and make known what their opinion was in thoſe poynts: <hi>Utenbogard</hi> having labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have a hearing before the States alone, There traduceth the actions of his Brethren in demanding the Declaration of their minds hereupon, as if this were to bring in a new kind of Inquiſition amongſt them, not to be endured. And hereupon obtaines of the States, that no ſuch Declaration ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at their hands. And more then that, finding the Deputies of the Synode by their continuall ſollicitations with the States (as it well became them in their places) to be moſt prejudiciall to their proceedings, they brought it ſo to paſſe, that like as formerly their Annuall Synods were hindered, ſo now it was forbidden to the Deputies themſelves, thenceforth to take any ſuch ſtile unto them, or performe any ſuch office as whereabout they were then imployed. And ſo the Relator proceeds in ſetting downe their inſolent cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes untill at length perceiving, that by the mediation of the King of Great Brittaine, all for the moſt part, inclined to the convocation of a Nationall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, they fell plainly on, upon theſe deſperate Counſells openly profeſſing that the calling of a Nationall Councell, would prove prejudiciall to the Majeſty

and Liberty of the Provinces, manifeſting themſelves hereby utterly averſe from ſuch a courſe; which yet hath been moſt in uſe in the Church of God, and that of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, for the pacifying of contentions ariſing in matter of Religion. I profeſſe, I nothing affect to ſpend time in ſuch ſearches and relations, I had rather imploy it another way, but you ſee I am driven unto it, to repreſent the unſhamefaſed conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Narration.</p>
                                 <p n="4">4. And whereas he ſaith, <hi>It was accuſed with open mouth, and challenged of falſhood,</hi> it is apparent that the Remonſtrants would very well have reſted contented with a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all toleration of one another in their ſeverall waies. For when <hi>Utenbogard</hi> and <hi>Feſtus Hommius</hi> were to meet together, and treat upon ſome faire courſe of compoſition, <hi>Utenbogard,</hi> together with thoſe of his ſide, profeſſed they knew no other courſe for ſetling peace, but my mutually tolerating one the other; <hi>Feſtus Hommius</hi> and others with him on the other ſide, profeſſed they knew no better courſe then convocation of a Nationall Synode, and in the interim to tolerate one another, provided they would declare themſelves to differ from the received doctrine in the Church, in no other points then in the five Articles. But how they carried themſelves herein refuſing to declare themſelves, I have formerly ſhewed. And farther, in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of this their practice to enjoy toleration, it is farther ſtoried, by what means they procured a Letter from King James to farther them therein, and after that an Edict to that purpoſe from ſome of the States. And conſider far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, If any amongſt us ſhould riſe up, and confederate themſelves and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne any five Articles of the Church of England, and accuſe us for maintaining erronious doctrine therein, and challenge us for falſhood, if they doe it with never ſo open mouth, ſhall this be ſufficient to juſtify them and condemne us, if wee doe not come to a tryall with them to diſpute the caſe, though Wee are the Poſſeſſours, They the Intruders and Innovators? Wee maintaining no other Doctrine then that which is by Authority eſtabliſhed amongſt us, and They which impugne the doctrine received, are they not uſually judged amongſt us, as ſuch who are rather to be cenſured then diſputed with? And withall conſider, that this <hi>mutua tolerantia,</hi> which the Remonſtrants ſo much preſſed and were ſo glad to enjoy, was with greateſt inſtance ſtood for long after the Conference at the Hague. Laſtly, how often was Arminius himſelfe queſtioned and called upon to give ſatisfaction for his Heterodoxies, and how often did he decline it? When at the firſt, Motion was made for his ſurrogation into the place of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> beind deceaſed, then the ſuſpicions of his Heterodox breaking forth, and they of Amſterdam not well likeing to let him goe from them, amongſt whom at that time, he exerciſed his Miniſtry; and that becauſe they obſerved his luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and novelizing Wit, which was like to breed dangerous effects in an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: at length upon the great inſtance both of <hi>Utenbogard</hi> and <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe, way was made for him unto the Chayre, upon condition he ſhould conferre with <hi>Gomarus</hi> upon ſome chief heads of Doctrine, and by a round declaration of his mind thereon, remove all ſuſpicion of Heterodoxy, having formerly by a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Proteſtation given his word, that in caſe he had any ſingular opinion of his own, he would not ſpread it. Hereupon he made open profeſſion, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the chiefe Pelagian opinions concerning grace naturall, the ſtrength of Free-will, Originall ſinne, the perfection of man in this life, and Predeſtination, and that he approved all thoſe diſputes, which <hi>Austin</hi> and other Fathers had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt them; and that in his judgement the Pelagian errours were rightly refuted by thoſe Fathers, and withall promiſed, that he would teach nothing that differed from the received Doctrine of the Churches; and hereupon he was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Profeſſors place in the Univerſity. In the beginning whereof he laboured by all means to quench all ſuſpicion of Heterodoxy in himſelfe, and maintained the doctrine of the Reformed Churches, <hi>De ſatisfactione Chriſti, de Fide juſtificante, de juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catione per fidem, de Perſeverantiâ verè fidelium, de Certitudine ſalutis, de Perfectione hominis in hac vitâ &amp;c.</hi> all which he afterwards contradicted, as alſo did his Followers. This I ſay, he then at the firſt maintained publiquely, <hi>contrà ſententiam ſuam</hi> (which let every man judge, whether it be not as much as to ſay, againſt his own Conſcience) and <hi>Corvinus</hi> is alleaged as in a certain Writing of his ſet forth in Low-Dutch inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly profeſſing as much, <hi>Praefat, in Synod.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56120:47"/>
himſelfe, and by his Publique Lectures, and chiefly by his dealing with his Schollers in private, his heterodoxy diſcovered it ſelfe. Here upon the deputies from the Churches of South and North Holland are ſent unto him, who acquaint him with the rumours that went of him, praying him that if he diſliked ought in the doctrine received, he would ſincerely declare it unto his Brethren, to the end, either by a friendly Conference, he might receive ſatisfaction, or the whole buſineſſe might lawfully be put over to the conſideration of a Synod. <hi>Arminius</hi> his anſwer was, that he never gave any juſt cauſe, why ſuch rumour ſhould be ſpread of him, neither was it wiſdome for him to treat with them as with Deputies, that ſhould make relation of the whole matter to a Synod, though as private perſons, he refuſed not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with them, provided that in caſe they differed, no relation hereof ſhould be made unto a Synod. The Church of <hi>Leyden</hi> alſo admoniſhed him, that there might be a Conference between him and his Colleagues, before the Presbytery of that Church. To them he anſwered he could not yeeld thereto, without leave from the Gurators of the Univerſity, and that he perceived not, that any benefit was like to redound unto the Church by ſuch a Conference. At another time Fol. 4. p. 2. being entreated by the Profeſſors and Paſtors with great earneſtneſſe, that if he had ought to ſay againſt the doctrine received in their Confeſſion and Catechiſme, he would freely and brotherly communicate it unto them, promiſing their endeavours to give him full ſatisfaction, or if not ſo, yet that he and his Colleagues under certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions might come to a faire agreement, to live together in peace, and that the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation being made, nothing which paſſed between them ſhould be divulged. The anſwer he made, was this, It was no wiſe part for him to yeeld to their motion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he bound thereto, the preſent meeting being not ordained unto any ſuch purpoſe, fol. 5. p. 2. <hi>Gomarus</hi> openly tells him, how it became him to declare his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>ne<expan>

As for the eaſineſſe of defending it, if it be not, or were not ſo in their opinion, who are here pretended to have declined the ſifting of it, What is that to the purpoſe? Then who are they, who ſay it may ſo eaſily be defended? I never read any hitherto, who doe not acknowledge a great myſtery in the divine providence. And from the daies of <hi>Anſelme</hi> unto this preſent day, it hath ever been accounted (in my obſervation) a very difficult poynt to accord predeſtination divine, with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of mens wills. But put the caſe it may eaſily be defended, as of evident truth by the word of God, yet notwithſtanding, if it be found harſh to mens affections, are they likely to admit it with ſuch eaſe? I ſhould think it ought to be put out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>that God hath mercy on whom he will,</hi> in beſtowing faith and repentance upon them, and thereby curing their naturall infidelity and hardneſſe of heart, as alſo <hi>that God hardneth whom he will,</hi> leaving their infidelity and hardneſſe of heart uncured; yet when fleſh and bloud riſeth up againſt this doctrine thus, <hi>Why then doth God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine;</hi> (to wit, of mans diſobedience) <hi>for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> And the Apoſtle addreſſeth hereunto no other anſwer but this, <hi>O man who art thou who diſputeſt with God? ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the clay of the ſame lump, to make one veſſell unto honour, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto diſhonour?</hi> Is fleſh and bloud, I pray, apt to reſt ſatisfied with this?</p>
                                 <p>Now as touching the two things I promiſed to adde, they are theſe.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. I pray conſider whether in all this, this Author doth not very judiciouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56120:48"/>
ſentence againſt himſelfe. For you know, your own motion you made unto him, and the promiſe he made unto you; and I pray conſider how anſwerable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto hath been his performance. The certain Controverſies, as touching which he profeſſeth change of Opinion, what are they, but the five Articles ſo much agitated between the Remonſtrants, and the Contra-Remonſtrants? Doe you not perceive how he makes choyce only of reprobation to grate upon? Is he not content to lye cloſe as touching foure of them? What is this, but according to his language, <hi>the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting of corners?</hi> And what willingneſſe of abideing the tryall doth this manifeſt? Yet he pleaſeth himſelfe in a conceit, of being as free from guile, as <hi>David</hi> was when he offered himſelfe to the Lords tryall, and thereupon advanceth himſelfe to the greater liberty of cenſuring others, ſuch as <hi>Beza,</hi> and <hi>Muſculus,</hi> and their Fellowes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Contra-Remonſtrants, as too full of that guile, whereof himſelfe, by virtue not of his Free-will, but of a grace of God of his ſhapeing, is voyd. This is an uſuall courſe with thoſe of his ſpirit, whereof I have had plentifull experience in this very kind. For if you believe them, all the Arminians Geeſe are Swannes, and all our Swannes are Geeſe in compariſon to them. He hopes you will not think he hates the light, or refuſeth to come to the light, (in his phraſe) this is the cenſure he libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally beſtowes upon his oppoſites. For though ſome of our Divines are willing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to treat of the five Articles, yet to treat of reprobation, which is a part of one of thoſe, they are not ſo willing, but this young Maſter in Iſrael, out of the pleropho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conceit of his own integrity and ſufficiency, is very willing to treat of this of reprobation, though he leaves all the reſt alone. Yet I pray make the ſcales even, What inſtance can be given, I doe not ſay of <hi>Beza, Muſculus,</hi> or any one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-Remonſtrants, but of any one of the like condition to himſelfe, that being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by a friend (as this Author was by you) to ſhew the reaſons, why he hath changed his mind from Arminianiſme, to the oppoſite opinions, hath carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as this Author hath done, to give his reaſons only on the part of one of them, and yet paſſeth his cenſure ſo prodigally on others for refuſing triall, by the way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, a glorious oſtentation of his own performances to the contrary, as if he had done a notable piece of ſervice, whereas all that he hath performed hereon, by proofe from teſtimonies of Scripture, are little more then two Leaves, and therein alſo as it were purpoſely, declines all thoſe places, wherein the Scripture ſpeaketh direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of election, predeſtination, and of that, which in effect, is all one with reprobation. Such places pregnantly ſpeaking hereof, he purpoſely declines, and yet he calls the places he inſiſts upon, <hi>pregnant teſtimonies;</hi> and indeed ſo they are, but nothing at all to the purpoſe of predeſtination, election, or reprobation. Yet I marvaile not he is ſo well conceited of his atchievements. I remember the Fable of the fly, ſitting on a Cart-wheele, in a dry ſummers day, and ſaying, <hi>See what a duſt I make.</hi> For, becauſe he hath diſcharged himſelf ſo unworthily with you, he may be bold to conceit, that if he had to deale with <hi>Beza,</hi> or with any of the Contra-Remonſtrants, or of the Synod of Dort, he would make it ſoon appeare, <hi>that Hereſy and untruth condemnes it ſelfe</hi> (this is the ſweet accommodation he makes of that the Apoſtles <gap reason="foreign">
                                       <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                                    </gap>) to wit, by their refuſing the touch-ſtone, and his readineſſe backed with all ſufficiency to come thereto, whereof he hath given ſo plentifull demonſtration in this he hath written un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; as if he had been with ſome Oracle of late, who had not only revealed unto him, ſome reaſonable motives, and wiſe carriages of the matter, but inſpired him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with ſome martiall ſpirit, fit for any encounter, deſpiſing his Adverſaries, as empty Schollers, and as if their parts were but copper, to his gold. Therefore he may take heart to ſpeak boldly, and ſhew himſelfe in the clear day, when ſuch as <hi>Beza</hi> make choyce to walk in miſtrs, and dwell in ſilence. Beſides his care is very Apoſtolicall for the peace of the Church, whereas <hi>Beza's</hi> was not at Mompelgard, nor the Contra-Remonſtrants, neither at the Hague Conference, or at the Synod of Dort. For none of theſe belike, have been ſo forward to ſhew themſelves unto the World, and upon the ſtage, for the maintenance of their doctrine (at leaſt in the poynt of reprobation) no not <hi>Beza</hi> in his Lectures upon the ninth to the Romans. Yet neither this man nor his Oracle hath done ought that I know, but in corners. And in corners I find theſe ſpirits exceeding buſy; and I have been ſo happy (for ſo I account it, although I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my time might be farre more profitably beſtowed) as to meet with ſome of their Myſteries, ere I was aware. And I find their Lyons skinnes, doe ſmell farre more of the Fox then of ehe Lyon.</p>

2. The ſecond is this, Why ſhould their carriage be any prejudice to others, who are as willing to give an account of their faith in theſe particulars, as any Arminian whatſoever. For my part, I never met with any of them, that I declined, nor I hope never ſhall. I heartily wiſh, time might ſerve me for them all. I have dealt with Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius his <hi>Examen,</hi> his Conference with <hi>Junius, Corvinus</hi> his anſwer unto <hi>Tilenus,</hi> I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon <hi>Voſſius</hi> his Pelagian Hiſtory. I deſire I might have time and opportunity, for their <hi>Synodalia Dordracena,</hi> but moſt of all with the Jeſuits; while I deale with them I learne ſomewhat, but nothing at all while I am occupied with the Arminians.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. Let mee adde one thing more: In the Articles of our Church, the ſeaventeenth is concerning Predeſtination and Election, not one concerning Reprobation. If any of us, ſhould forbeare to meddle with the doctrine of reprobation in diſpute, may we not juſtly plead, a faire conformity to the wiſdome of the Church whereof we are members? And by the way to touch one thing, Might not this be the reaſon, why this author utterly pretermits the proſecuting his opinion concerning Predeſtination and election, to wit, leaſt thereby he ſhould fall foule upon the doctrine of our Church, ſo evidently ſet downe in that Article concerning the poynt of Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? The Church of Ireland content themſelves, with the very forme of that 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of ours concerning Predeſtination: Only they premiſe two Theſes; the one whereof is this, <hi>God from all eternity, did by his unchangeable Councell ordaine, whatſoever in time ſhould come to paſſe, yet ſo, as thereby no violence is offered to the Wills of the reaſonable creatures, and neither the liberty, nor the contingency of the ſecond cauſe is taken away, but eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed rather;</hi> The other this, <hi>By the ſame eternall Counſell, God hath Predeſtinated ſome unto life, and Reprobated ſome unto death, of both which there is a certain number, known only unto God, which neither can be increaſed nor diminiſhed.</hi>

Now if ſome Rabſhakeh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them ſhould turne heathen (for ſuch a tradition, as I remember is received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Rabbins, namely, that <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> was a Jew, but turned heathen) and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards endeavoured to entice the Jewes to doe as he did, and that becauſe of the infamous nature of their Religion amongſt heathens, how deſerved ſuch a one to be entertained by them?

                                 <p>Againe, Is it to be expected, that any doctrine ſhould be well ſpoken of, by ſuch as are oppoſites and adverſaries thereunto? Suppoſe a rigid Lutheran ſhould by Gods providence, be taken off from their ubiquitary doctrine; and in juſtifying himſelfe for the change of his Opinion, ſhould repreſent unto them, the infamous condition of that doctrine, both in the judgement of Papiſts, and in the judgement of Calviniſts; I pray conſider, How in all likelyhood would this plea be entertained? Could he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any better recompence hereof, then to be caſt out of their Synagogues? Suppoſe a Papiſt ſhould have his eyes opened, and brought to the truth of God in the poynt of juſtification, and, being demanded the reaſon of this change of mind in him, ſhould anſwer, that the infamy of this doctrine, both amongſt Lutherans and Calviniſts is ſo great, and that ſuch a morſell, which neither Lutherans nor Calviniſts can ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſhould therefore (in his judgement) not down very eaſily with Papiſts, and without ſuſpicion. Now let any indifferent Reader confider, how this plea in all probability would be received amongſt papiſts. Yet I mean not to quiet my ſelfe, or content my Reader with this parallell. Of that which he here delivers of Papiſts, he gives us no evidence but his bare word in pawne, for the credit of this aſſertion. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56120:49"/>
gives he any teſtimony of Lutherans, their calling us <hi>damned Calvenists,</hi> and though he had, I pray, what were we the farther off from the kingdome of God for that? And I pray conſider, is it not in our power to recompence them, and call them, damned Lutherans, if we liſt to recompence malice with malice, ſo to ſerve our own turnes? And all this is delivered by him without diſtinction of Papiſts, learned and unlearned, Dominicans and Jeſuits; in like ſort without all diſtinction of Lutherans, whether rigid or moderate. But let us examine his crimination a part.</p>
                                 <p>And firſt, as for Papiſts; not one is here named, nor any reference made to any of of them. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                                    <hi>Pauls</hi> prayer was, <hi>that they might be delivered from unreaſonable men.</hi> I think never Sect roſe upmore unreaſonable then this Sect of Arminians. This Writing came unto my hands, before I had diſpatched a large diſcourſe ſent unto me from one of ſame Sect, and therein I have met with pregnant evidences, that more heads then one, were employed thereabouts. And there I am told to my face, that our doctrine of abſolute reprobation, we have learned from the Papiſts. Another with whom I had to doe not long before, profeſſeth in plain manner thus; <hi>The Jeſuits ten of them for one, favour the abſolute irreſpective decree, following herein as they think</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                                    <hi>Auſtin, but eſpecially their</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                                    <hi>Thomas, and Scotus, with all the rabble of rotten Schoolmen, and the whole Tribe at this day of the Dominicans, who are buzy zelots for the cauſe; of whoſe conſent ſome amongſt us are not aſhamed to bragge.</hi> If our irreſpective decree, be ſo joyntly maintained by both Jeſuits, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans, and that as they think according to <hi>Auſtin,</hi> how is it poſſible our doctrine herein, can be ſo odious to the Papiſts? Or what Papiſts doth he mean, if neither Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits nor Dominicans, nor any ſuch as concurre with either of them? Or if it be ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious unto them, as one Arminian Proſelite profeſſeth, how can it be ſo concordant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained by them, as another Arminian proſelite avoucheth? And if we have learned it at the hands of Papiſts, what will theſe Lutherans gaine, by uniting with Papiſts rather then with us, that is, with the Maſters rather then with the Schollars. And if a Lutheran ſhould be converted to the embracing of our Tenent herein, and to juſtify himſelfe ſhould plead; That we Calviniſts are ready to proteſt, that in the doctrine of reprobation and predeſtination, we had rather unite our ſelves with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts then with them, Of what moment think you, would this motive be with them, which this Author moſt inconſiderately propoſeth, as a poynt of very ponderous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration?</p>
                                 <p>But as touching Papiſts, their diſlike of us, he confines it only to the Supralapſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian-way. And indeed that diſtinction of the Supralapſarian and Sublapſarian-way. was brought in meerely to get thereby ſome more elbow roome. For if they agree with us in the poynt of Gods abſolute and irreſpective decrees, how improbable is it, that the doctrine of any of our Divines, in ſtating the object of predeſtination to be <hi>humanum genus nondum conditum,</hi> will prove odious unto them; conſidering this is a meer Logicall difference, as I have ſhewed in my <hi>Vindic. Grat. Dei cap.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 1. <hi>De Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natione digreſſ.</hi> 1. Yet as touching the Supralapſarian-way, that opinion is imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Junius</hi> by <hi>Arminius,</hi> as alſo to <hi>Thomas</hi> and his Followers. <hi>Collat. Armin. cum Juni. pag.</hi> 4. and if ſo, how improbable is it, that ſuch an Opinion ſhould be ſo odious to the Papiſts, as this Author upon his bare word avoucheth. And <hi>Alphonſus Mendoza</hi> ſpares not to profeſſe, that ſupernaturalls were intended by God before naturalls; and his diſcourſe hereupon, was taken with admiration by his Auditors in Spaine, and he was urged as himſelfe profeſſeth, to ſet it forth in Print. And the <hi>Quatuor ſigna Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſci Mayronis</hi> (mentioned by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                                    <hi>Perkins De Praedeſt. Modo &amp; Ordine)</hi> doe manifeſt that he took the ſame way; and theſe <hi>quatuor ſigna, Franciſcus Mayro</hi> received from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Scotus.</hi> It is well known that in the Synod of Dort, there met Divines diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in this poynt, who yet neither hated one anothers doctrine nor perſons for this difference; like as ſo it is amongſt us, as in the place above mentioned I have ſhewed. Nay it is apparent, that <hi>Junius</hi> took upon him to reconcile all three opinions there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, and <hi>Piſcator</hi> after him, who alſo hath diſcharged his part herein, farre more clearely then <hi>Iunius.</hi> And no marvail, <hi>Iunius</hi> having firſt broken the ice. But that the truth may not be carried in the clouds of ambiguities, as they deſire, who are in love with errour: All the queſtion between theſe our Divines conſiſts in this, Whether it were the will of God that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould fall by his permiſſion, ſo to make way for Gods glorious ends, to wit, the manifeſtation of his glory, in the incarnation of the Sonne of God, as alſo in the way of mercy, in the ſalvation of ſome; and in the way of juſtice, in the condemnation of others. The Supralapſarians maintaine, that ſuch
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56120:50"/>
was the will of God, leaſt otherwiſe way ſhould be made for the manifeſtation of Gods glorious works by accident, rather then by Gods providence. Other Divines that take the Sublapſarian way, had rather decline this nice poynt as difficult, then oppoſe it as odious. But ſay I, the doctrine wherein both Jeſuits and Arminians doe agree, will abundantly ſerve us to juſtify us, in the poſitive and affirmative part of ſo nice a poynt as this. For by their doctrine of <hi>Scientia Media,</hi> God did foreſee, that upon ſuch an adminiſtration of his providence about <hi>Adam</hi> as was uſed, <hi>Adam</hi> would fall; and more then this, that God could have brought forth other adminiſtrations of his providence in very great variety, ſome whereof were ſuch, that if God had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Adam</hi> would not have fallen. Now being pleaſed to make uſe of ſuch an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of providence divine, upon the purpoſe whereof, he foreſaw <hi>Adam</hi> would fall; and not being pleaſed to uſe ſuch a providence, upon the purpoſe whereof, he had foreſeen <hi>Adam</hi> would not have fallen; I call here all the indifferent of the World to judge, whether it doth not manifeſtly follow herehence, that it was the will of God, <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould fall by his permiſſion.</p>
                                 <p>Again, throughout our doctrine, nothing is more harſh then that of Gods deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the will of the creature, to every act of his, as touching the ſubſtance thereof. Dares this author betray ſuch ignorance, as hand over head to profeſſe, that this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is odious unto Papiſts? Whereas the moſt learned in the Church of Rome, are well known to maintain it in expreſſe termes, whereas our Divines courſe is, to keep themſelves to the phraſe of Scriptures. And as for the Jeſuits who oppoſe it, and in the place thereof bring in <hi>Scientia Media,</hi> and <hi>Gratia Congrua,</hi> ſhaped after the genius of <hi>Scientia Media.</hi> I can ſhew an expreſſe acknowledgement under the hand of a zealot for the Arminian cauſe, that between the <hi>Gratia praedeterminans</hi> of the Dominicans, and <hi>Gratia congrua</hi> of the Jeſuits, there is no ſuch materiall difference at all, but that the abſoluteneſſe of predeſtination and reprobation doth follow, as well upon the one, as upon the other.</p>
                                 <p>To conclude, I would this Author would be ſo wiſe, as once more to conſult with his Oracle, and enquire, Whether Papiſts are more ready to joyne with Lutherans, in their doctrine of Chriſts Ubiquity, as touching his Manhood, then with us in the poynt of Reprobation, or of Gods concourſe. For ſuppoſe we held as <hi>Suarez</hi> is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſtate our Tenent, namely, <hi>Quod Deus omnipotenti voluntate nobis neceſſitatem imponat;</hi> yet the ſame <hi>Suarez</hi> ſaith, that in this very poynt, we are not reprehended of them, as if we affirmed ought, <hi>Quod vel in re ipſâ contradictionem involvat, aut Dei omnipotentiam ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peret.</hi> I preſume no Papiſt is ſo well conceited in the Lutherans doctrine in the poynt of Ubiquity.</p>
                                 <p>From that which he affirmes of Papiſts, I come to that which he affirmes of Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans. And what one inſtance hath he given of any Lutheran, ſpeaking againſt our making the corrupt Maſſe the object of predeſtination or reprobation? Surely not one, either out of Sir <hi>Edwin Sands,</hi> nor out of <hi>Oſiander;</hi> Nay what cauſe is there, why either Papiſt or Lutheran ſhould, in caſe the object thus ſtated (or in a more rigid forme of the Maſſe Uncorrupt) doth no way conſtraine us to maintaine, that God doth intend the damnation of any man, in any moment of nature, before the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of him, as departing out of this World, under the power of ſinne; no nor to maintain, that God doth intend the ſalvation of any man, in any moment of nature, before the conſideration of him, in finall perſeverance in faith and repentance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided God ſuffer him, to live untill the uſe of reaſon, as I have ſhewed, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to juſtify, and make appeare, in my <hi>Vindic. Grat. Dei,</hi> in the digreſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Predeſtination. For indeed not any of our Divines was, I think, ever known to maintain, that God did intend to damne any man but for ſinne; Neither doe I maintaine, that God intended to beſtow ſalvation on any man of ripe years, but by way of reward of his faith and repentance. The true and principall, reall (not verball only) difference between us, and the Arminians, is about Gods beſtowing of faith and repentance, and his purpoſe thereof. Now let any learned Lutheran deliver his mind on this, namely, upon the foreſight where of it is, that God gives faith and repentance unto ſome, and denyes it unto others. When <hi>Toſſanus</hi> makes relation of <hi>Hunnius</hi> his expoſition of that place Acts 13. 48. <hi>Et crediderunt quotquot ordinati erant ad vitam,</hi> thus, <hi>id eſt, qui ſeſe ordinarant &amp; diſpoſuerant ad audiendum Dei verbum;</hi> 
                                    <note n="*" place="margin">Et illud fide amplectendum.</note> 
                                    <hi>Hunnius</hi> in his refutation of <hi>Toſſanus</hi> his <hi>Theſes,</hi> cites <hi>Toſſanus</hi> to appear before the tribunall ſeat of the Judge both of quick and dead, and to ſhew in what place of his writings, this is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56120:50"/>
to be found, profeſſing that ſuch doctrine is the very Pelagian Hereſy, and that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe never approved it, but diſproved it rather, and moſt conſtantly impugned it. What Lutheran was ever known ſo abſurd, as to ſay, that God worketh in us, <gap reason="foreign">
                                       <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                                    <hi>Velle credere, modò Velimus?</hi> Yet this doctrine I can ſhew in expreſſe termes delivered by an Arminian. But come to the conſideration of the inſtances propoſed by him.</p>
                                 <p>The firſt is the Relation of Sir <hi>Edwin Sands.</hi> And I remember well to have read in him ſomewhat concerning the <hi>Predeſtinary Peſtilence,</hi> ſo called by ſome. And I might wonder at this Authors wiſdome, in pretermitting that paſſage; but upon ſearch finding it about Fol. 59. though my Book hath no quotation at all of pages, I ceaſed to wonder at his concealing of it. I have rather cauſe to commend his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome therein, although it expreſſeth that whereupon this Author formerly touched, as concerning the Lutherans readineſſe to returne to the Papacy rather then to admit that Predeſtinary Peſtilence. For predeſtinary peſtilence goeth not here alone, but is joyned with the Sacramentary peſtilence, <hi>For theſe two poynts,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are the ground of the quarrell;</hi> but he addes I confeſſe, that <hi>the Predeſtinary peſtilence was more ſcandalous at that day then the former.</hi> Yet the ſame Author profeſſeth Fol. 73. of the Lutherans, that if he fetch an elle forwards one way, for an elle he looſeth another way, it is only by a kind of boyſterous force and violence againſt the Calviniſts, as in Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough of late. And the reaſon hereof he takes to be in part the Abſurdities of the <hi>Ubiquitary Chimaera.</hi> And as for the paſſage here alleaged, I find it about Fol. 86. Wherein I conſider, Firſt that the ſpeculative opinions he ſpeaks of are not about the eternall decrees of God only, or eſpecially above all others, as here by cunning carriage it is pretended. For the words runne thus; <hi>It can be no blemiſh to them to reviſe their Doctrine, and to abate the rigour of certain ſpeculative opinions, eſpecially touching the eternall decrees of God, the quality of mans nature, the uſe of works, wherein ſome of their chiefe Authors have come to ſuch an utter oppoſition, &amp;c</hi> So that the poynts of rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous doctrine, which were to be qualified in this Gentlemans judgement, are many, but eſpecially three; The firſt whereof is touching the eternall decrees of God, The ſecond concerning the quality of mans nature, The third concerning the uſe of Works: So that the doctrine of Gods eternall decrees is not the poynt alone, the rigour whereof eſpecially is to be qualified in this Authors judgement, but this eſpeciall care of qualification, is by him referred to the three poynts formerly mentioned, and that indifferently. Secondly, Whereas this Author relates, that this is delivered, not as out of the relators judgement only, but as out of <hi>the judgement of men whom he commends for ſingular learning and Piety.</hi> I find no ſuch matter in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that I have, though I have ſearched after it, both by conſidering what went before, and what comes after, as farre as he treats of the ſame matter. Whether this comes in a ſecond Edition I know not: in mine I find no ſuch thing. So that the weight of this motive hitherto, lies wholly upon the authority of this Gentleman. And ſurely I ſhould think it were nothing hard to counterballance this authority to the full. And it may be he ſpeaks herein no other thing then wherein he was endoctrinated by his Tutor, as lately an ingenious and grave divine, differing from us in the poynt of reprobation, moſt ingeniouſly acknowledged, that he was brought into that opinion of his by his Tutor, who was a Lutheran: And I doubt we have too many ſuch amongſt us. Of late I have heard, that one of good place ſpared not openly to profeſſe, ſaying, <hi>Call us as we ought to be called, for we are Lutherans:</hi> I would wee had not too many Popiſh-hearted amongſt us.</p>
                                 <p>Thirdly, whereas this Gentleman adviſeth us to reviſe the Doctrines, and this Author accommodates it only to Gods eternall decrees; I have already performed this, and qualified the rigour of ſome mens opinions thereabouts. For whereas ſome have ſubordinated Gods decree of permitting ſinne, to the decree of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I have taken another courſe, and doe maintain, that in no moment of nature is the decree of damnation, before the decree of permitting finall perſeverance in ſinne. Again, I preſume this Gentlemans meaning is not, that the doctrine of the Church of England is rigorous, as touching Gods eternall decrees. I willingly profeſſe, I deſire no better triall of the truth of the Doctrine I maintain hereabouts, next unto the Word of God, then to be tried by the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of the Church of England, and by the Articles of the Church of Ireland, ſet forth in the daies of King James
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56120:51"/>
Thirdly, I would it were put unto this Gentleman, if he be living, Whether in his Opinion, God of his free grace doth beſtow faith and repentance on ſome, thereby to cure that naturall infidelity and hardneſſe of heart, which is originally found in all, and of his meer pleaſure, he denies it unto other: Or whether finding ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall difference or preparation in one more then in another, is hereupon moved to give faith and repentance unto them, and deny it unto others. If he ſhall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that God doth ſhew his mercy to whom he will, that is, of his meer pleaſure, and denies it to whom he will, I am ready to profeſſe, that let him ſtate Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall decrees after what manner he will, I ſhall willingly ſubſcribe thereunto; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be ſuitable unto the former ground: and as for the unſuitable nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if in caſe it ſo fall out, let the proofe and evident demonſtration thereof, lye on mee. But if his opinion be, that God beſtowes faith and repentance on man, moved thereunto by ſome morall preparation, which he finds in one, rather then in another, I appeale to the Lutherans themſelves, whether this be not in plain termes no better then Pelagianiſme.</p>
                                 <p>As for his calling their opinions in this poynt, ſpeculative opinions (as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would have us obſerve) I am willing to obſerve it: and withall I think, he doth it with better judgement, then this Author doth in calling them pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall.</p>
                                 <p>And whereas it is pretended, that our Divines have been carried into theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of theirs, <hi>in oppoſition to Popiſh Doctrine,</hi> This is ſo out of ſeaſon in theſe daies (notwithſtanding the raw judgement of this Author) that our Arminians ſpare not to profeſſe (as formerly mentioned) and charge us to our face, that we have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this doctrine of ours, out of the Writings of Papiſts. And <hi>Grevincovius,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Ameſius,</hi> ſpares not to pronounce, that They may with better credit fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Jeſuits, then Wee the Dominicans, conſidering that the Dominicans are the great Adminiſtrators of the Inquiſition in Spaine. This is delivered as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poynt of grace and Free-will: but as touching the poynt of election and reprobation abſolute, I can ſhew under the hand of an Arminian, that herein there is no materiall difference between the Dominicans, and moſt part of the Jeſuits; ſo little difference there is between the <hi>Gratia Praedeterminans</hi> of the one, and the <hi>Gratia Congrua</hi> of the other. So that if this be true, it is not probable, that hereby we ſcandalize the judicious and learned Papiſts; and what thoſe other Churches are which we ſcandalize, excepting Churches Lutheran, either this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor knows not, or is well content to diſſemble it, to wit, the Churches of Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Anabaptiſts. And how doe we more ſcandalize the Churches Lutheran herein, then they ſcandalize us? Was it ever known, that by meer differing in Opinion from other Churches, Chriſtian men were ſaid to ſcandalize them? Or if it were ſo, muſt not the ſcandall in this caſe, be equall on both ſides?</p>
                                 <p>As for the leaving many of our own very ill ſatisfied, why ſhould that ſeem ſtrange? What doth <hi>Carryer</hi> write of many well known to him in this our Church of England, of the ſame mind with himſelfe, ſome Papiſts, ſome Lutherans? And may there not be as many amongſt the Lutherans, as ill ſatisfied with the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine commonly received amongſt them, ſave that they are farre more forward, to excommunicate all ſuch, as ſoon as they appeare, then Wee? Beſides all this, The poynt of ſcandall is brought in very unſeaſonably; For if it be a truth that we maintain and profeſſe, if any are ſcandalized by it, it is a ſcandall taken, not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: God forbid we ſhould grow ſo profane, as to account it a ſcandalous thing to make profeſſion of Gods truth; eſpecially this truth we maintain being ſo neere to a cleare oppoſition to Pelagianiſme, a Hereſy condemned by the Church above 1200 years agoe.</p>
                                 <p>When <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Woortenberg</hi> exhorted his Divines to acknowledge <hi>Beza,</hi> and his Company for Brethren, and to declare it by giving them their hands; The anſwer of refuſall was made by <hi>Jacobus Andreas</hi> a moſt bitter enimy, and one whom <hi>Beza</hi> deſcribes, <hi>tanquam virum ſanguinarium,</hi> and his carriage throughout was moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious. And it becomes an Arminian ſpirit well, to make the rancour of his mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart, a rule wherebyto cry down the doctrine which he abhorred. With a farre better grace might a Papiſt cry down our faith, oppoſite to the doctrine of the Church of Rome, by the Popes abhorring it, and damning of it to the pit
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56120:51"/>
of hell. For ſurely it is fit he ſhould be of farre more authority then <hi>Jacobus Andreas;</hi> not to ſpeak of the Anathematization of it in the Councell of Trent, nor of the common argument of Papiſts, in that they deny that we can be ſaved, many amongſt us are of opinion, that a Papiſt can be ſaved, therefore better to be a Papiſt then a Proteſtant; yet ſurely it is in the power of our corruption to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite malice with malice, and as much to ſcorne with our heeles their Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, as they ours. But if through the grace of God, we doe not give our ſelves leave to requite their malice, if that be no ſcandall to themſelves, there is no cauſe why it ſhould be any ſcandall unto us. In Sir <hi>Edwin Sands</hi> about Fol. 59. there is ſuch a relation as this, Though the Princes and Heads of the weaker ſides in thoſe parts both of Palſgrave and Landſgrave, have with great wiſdome and judgement (to aſlack thoſe flames) impoſed ſilence on that poynt, to the Miniſters of the one Party, hoping that the charity and diſcretion of the other ſort, would have done the like: yet it falleth out otherwiſe, that Lutheran Preachers rage hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in their Pulpits. Now let Arminians if they think good, conclude herehence, that ſeeing there was ſo little charity and diſcretion, in the Lutheran Preachers, it becomes them in their writings and Concluſions, to ſhew as little chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and diſcretion as they for their hearts; and that grace of God which they faſhion to themſelves, will bear them out in this, it beeing meerely the power of their own free-wills. But this is not all I have to ſay in anſwer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                                 <p>The phraſe in <hi>Oſiander</hi> is not, <hi>errorum teterrimorum,</hi> but <hi>haereſcωn teterrimarum,</hi> of which this Author ſaith, they reckoned this for one. And let him ſpeak out and tell us, what were the others. Was not the denyall of Conſubſtantiation another? As alſo the denyall of the lawfulneſſe of that Baptiſme, which was adminiſtred by Woemen; (the practice whereof King <hi>James</hi> reformed in our Book of Common-Prayer:) As alſo their not concurrence with them in opinion about <hi>the Perſon of Chriſt,</hi> which by their <hi>Ubiquitary Chimaera</hi> (as Sir <hi>Edwin Sands</hi> call it) they doe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deforme. Theſe and other ſuch like were the errours, whereof this Author ſaith, <hi>Beza</hi> and his Fellowes were proved to be guilty of in this Conference, for ſo I take his meaning, pronouncing thereby ſentence <hi>tanquam ex Cathedra Judicis;</hi> or the Lutheran Party throughout in that Conference: which Conference was not of Predeſtination alone, but <hi>de Caenâ Domini, de Perſonâ Chriſti, de Imaginibus, de Baptiſmo,</hi> and laſt of all <hi>de Praedestinatione.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Yet I have not done with this. For I beſeech you conſider, whether this Author, or his Oracle, be not miſerably deceived in all this, and that theſe <hi>teterrimae Haereſes</hi> are not ſuch as <hi>Iacobus Andreas</hi> with his Lutheran party, laid to the charge of <hi>Beza</hi> and his Brethren, but rather ſuch as <hi>Beza</hi> and his Brethren, laid to the charge of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans; and that not in this Conference, but in their Writings, <hi>in Scriptis,</hi> ſo goeth the relation. Whereas this Conference was not by writing, but only by word of mouth; <hi>Iacobus Andreas</hi> not enduring to give way to <hi>Beza's</hi> motion as touching the conſigning of that which they delivered in writing under their hands. For the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Oſiander</hi> runs thus; <hi>Ad haec D.

But that which followes puts it out of all queſtion; where comes in manifeſtly, what the Lutheran Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conceived of the Doctrine of <hi>Beza</hi> implying thereby, what <hi>Beza</hi> and his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56120:52"/>
Fellows conceived of the Lutherans Doctrine, was formerly expreſſed; the words following are theſe, <hi>Contrà verò in quibus &amp; quàm tetris erroribus ipſi verſentur</hi> (that is <hi>Beza</hi> and his company) <hi>hac Collatione iis demonſtratum eſſe: In quibus cum adhuc perſeverent ipſos intelligere quòd eos pro fratribus agnoſcere non poſſint.</hi> In which words <hi>Andreas</hi> gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he and his Fellowes cannot acknowledge <hi>Beza</hi> and his fellowes for brethren, becauſe they maintained, <hi>tetros errores</hi> (as he calls them;) for proofe whereof he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales to the preſent Conference. And this being delivered on the contrary part to that which is delivered before, as appears by the very firſt word, <hi>Contra verò,</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that in the former part was ſet down, the reaſon why <hi>Beza</hi> and his fellowes, ſhould not deſire the fraternity of the Lutheran party, to wit, becauſe they laid to the Lutherans charge, that they maintained <hi>horrible errours and moſt peſtilent Hereſies,</hi> for proof whereof, he appeals not to this preſent Conference, which was carried wholly by word of mouth, but to their Writings. This being clearely the meaning of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas,</hi> it is apparent, that the charge laid by <hi>Beza</hi> and his fellowes, upon the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, was of fouler crimes, by <hi>Andreas</hi> his relation, then was the charge laid by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas</hi> upon <hi>Beza</hi> and his Brethren.

                                 <p>Of <hi>Hemingius</hi> his leaving his own ſide, I never heard or read before, unleſſe that of a Papiſt he became a Proteſtant. But the difference is well known between the rigid and moderate Lutherans, and theſe are called by the other <hi>Semi-Calviniani.</hi> And what I pray hath <hi>Hemingius</hi> deſerved, that his authority ſhould be greater then the authority of <hi>Zuinglius, Calvin, Junius; Zanchius, Piſcator.</hi> The Lutherans themſelves (I ſuppoſe) will hardly think him worthy to be remembred the ſame day with <hi>Martin Luther.</hi> And as for <hi>Martin Luthers</hi> doctrine herein, to my judgement, he is farre more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and reſolute then <hi>Calvin,</hi> and I find that <hi>Beza</hi> in his Conference of <hi>Mompelgard,</hi> doth ſometimes twit his oppoſites with <hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine, whereunto throughout that Conference, I doe not find they anſwer any thing at all.</p>
                                 <p>When he ſaith, It is a Morſell, which the greateſt part of the Chriſtian Churches cannot ſwallow; What a wild courſe doth he take in theſe his Motives. Muſt we for every doctrine of ours, examine whether the moſt part of Chriſtian Churches doe embrace it yea or no? Why ſhould wee not then runne out in this our ſearch, and enquire, what is the Moſcoviticall and Grecian Faith, what the Aethiopian, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſine, and ſo proceed in our contemplative perambulations, all the World over, and what we have found preacht unto our people alſo, to their more profound, and ſubſtantiall edification, if they liſt to believe us upon our word. But I ſuppoſe he looked no farther then to this Weſterne World, ſecluding the new diſcoveries within the laſt hundred years or ſomewhat more. And very confidently he muſt exclude all Popiſh Churches, or preſume they are for him in this. Yet as I ſaid, the very laſt Arminian, I have had to deale with, hath told me to my face, that my Doctrine of abſolute Reprobation, I have learned it of the Papiſts; and another to this purpoſe, there is no materiall difference between the <hi>Gratia Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grua</hi> of the Jeſuits, and <hi>Cratia praedeterminans</hi> of the Dominicans. And ſecluding Popiſh Churches, I know not who they are, whom he calls the greateſt part of the Chriſtian Churches. Be it, that the Lutheran Churches are a greater Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then the Churches of the Calviniſts (which is more then I find in Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win Sands</hi> his Relation.) Now ſuppoſe the number of the Calviniſts and their power were greater then that of the Lutherans; ask I pray any Lutheran in the World whether that were any reaſonable motive unto him to change his Religion and turne

Calviniſt? If it be of no weight to perſwade them, why ſhould it be of any moment to prevaile with us?</p>

                              <head>DISCOURSE. The Fourth Motive. <hi>Its affinity with the old exploded and condemned Errours of the Stoicks and Manichees.</hi>
                              </head>
                              <p>THe Opinion of the Stoicks was, that all actions and events were inevitable, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, either by the revolutions of the Heavens, and the qualities of the Starres, which raigne at mens births, or by the Concatenation of naturall things, and the diſpoſition of the firſt matters of all things, being ſo put together from eternity, that one thing muſt needs follow another as it doth, and the <hi>Materia Prima</hi> being ſo diſpoſed, that all things cannot ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively come to paſſe otherwiſe then they doe, but muſt of neceſſity be as they are, even <hi>invito Deo,</hi> though God would have ſome things to be otherwiſe then they be.</p>
                              <p>The Manichees held, that all mens actions, good or evill, were determined too: Good actions by a good God, who was the author of all good things created, and of all good actions that fell out in the World: Evill actions by an Evill God, who was the <hi>primum principium malt,</hi> the firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall author of all evill things that were extant in the world.</p>
                              <p>The Maintainers of the abſolute decree, doe ſay one of theſe two things; either that all actions na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and morall, good and evill, and all events likewiſe are abſolutely neceſſary, or that all mens ends (at leaſt) are unalterable and undeterminable by the power of their wills, which is upon the matter all one. For in vain is our freedome in the actions, if the end which they drive at be pitched and determined, ſith, <hi>Omnis actio eſt propter finem,</hi> All actions are done for the ends ſake, that it might be obtained by them, which without them could not.</p>
                              <p>Now in theſe three Opinions, we may note two things.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. The ſubſtance and formality of them, which is an unavoidableneſſe of mens actions and ends whatſoever they be; In this all of them agree and holding that in all things, undeclinable fates, and inſuperable neceſſity doe domineere. And therefore <hi>Melancthon</hi> doth not ſlack in many of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Places, to call this abſolute decree, <hi>Fatum Stoicum, Tabulas Parcarum,</hi> and to charge the Church of Geneva (the great defender of it) with a labour to bring in the Stoicks errours, as we may ſee in a certain Epiſtle of <hi>Melancthons</hi> to <hi>Peucer,</hi> where he ſpeaks thus, <hi>Scribit ad me Laetius de Stoico Fato uſ<expan>

                              <p n="2">2. The Circumſtances or the grounds of their Opinions. The Stoicks derive this neceſſity from the Starres or firſt matter, the Manichees from <hi>duo prima principia aeterna &amp; coeterna,</hi> and theſe laſt from the peremptory decree of Almighty God, ſo that in this they differ, but in this difference, the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks and the Manichees in ſome reſpects have the better. For it is better to derive the neceſſity of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill actions, or unhappy events from an evill God, or from the courſe of nature, then from the decree of that God who is infinitely good. The ſubſtance of their Opinions is all one, the ground wherein they differ is but accidentall to their errour.</p>
                              <p>If it be ſo, for this very reaſon alone may this doctrine of abſolute reprobation be ſuſpected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe dreams of the Stoicks were exploded by the beſt Philoſophers of all ſorts: and this of the Manichees was generally cryed down by the Fathers, not only as fooliſh, but as impious and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of entertainment in a Chriſtian heart, or Chriſtian Commonwealth, not ſo much for any thing circumſtantiall in it, but becauſe it made all things and events neceſſary, and ſo plucked up the roots of virtue, planted vice, and left no place for juſt rewards or puniſhments.</p>

                                 <p>It calls to my remembrance a ſtory that Mr <hi>Baſtard</hi> ſometimes told my good friend D. <hi>Hoskins,</hi> it was of a neighbour that came to him complaining of a friend of his, that had loſt all his five Senſes; as for example, his ſight and his ſeeing, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his amplification: with whom Mr <hi>Baſtard</hi> as it were, condoling, anſwered, Though he had loſt his fight, yet if he had retained his ſeeing, there had been ſome comfort. True Sir quoth the plain fellow. In like ſort, I might ſay, that though our Doctrine in this poynt be Stoicall, yet if it were not infamous there were ſome comfort in it, but the heavy crimination laid to our charge is, that it is not only Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icall, but infamous alſo.

                                 <p>That the Manichees maintained two ſupreme and coëternall cauſes of all things, we read; the one the cauſe of Good, the other of Evill: and that every creature was a ſubſtantiall part of one or both; and that man in his nature was compounded of both, and that his corruption was eſſentiall from the ſupream Author of evill, and not ſuch as acrewed to him of diſobedience, We read. But of their opinion that all things were determined by them, both good, and evill, I no where read, but in this Authors Legend. <hi>Danaeus</hi> hath commented upon <hi>Auſtin de Haereſibus,</hi> and to every Head of Hereſy draws what he hath read thereof in other Authors. But I find no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all of this Article amongſt 21 ſhamefull errours of theirs which he reckons up. The 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> is this, <hi>Voluntatem malè agendi, quod vocant liberum arbitrium, nob is à naturâ ipſâ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitam, non rebellione noſtrâ accerſitam, vel ex inobedientiâ natam; Quanquam homines propriâ vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate peccant.</hi> And where <hi>Auſtin</hi> anſwereth the criminations againſt the Catholiques made by the Pelagians, I find no mention at all of this.

                                 <p>The Firſt whereof is this; <hi>That all actions naturall and Morall, good and evill, and all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents likewiſe, are abſolutely neceſſary.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Concerning which, I ſay Firſt; I have cauſe to doubt that this Author underſtands not aright, the very notions of abſolute neceſſity, and neceſſity not abſolute. There is no greater neceſſity, then neceſſity of nature. And this neceſſity is twofold; either in <hi>Eſſendo,</hi> in being, or in <hi>Operando,</hi> in working. God alone is neceſſary in being, and his being is abſolutely neceſſary; it being impoſſible he ſhould not be, as not only we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but Schoole Divines demonſtrate, and that with great variety, of evident, and curious concluſions. As for the other neceſſity, which is in reſpect of operation: Firſt, this is no way incident unto God, ſpeaking of operation <hi>ad extrà,</hi> and ſecluding the myſterious emanations within the Divine Nature; ſuch as are the Generation of the Sonne by the Father, and the wonderfull Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne. But <hi>ad extra</hi> this neceſſity of operation is only found in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that only in ſuch creatures, as by neceſſity of nature are determined one way: as fire to burne; heavy things to move downwards, and light things upwards; the Sunne, Moone, and ſtarres to give light; and the heavens to turne round; all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Agents in a word diſtinct from rationall are thus determined, to wit, to work that, whereunto they are inclined by neceſſity of nature; but yet ſo that being finite, they are ſubject to ſuperiour powers, and thereby obnoxious to impediment moſt of them, even to powers create; all of them to power increate. Whence it comes paſſe that no work of theirs is abſolutely neceſſary, eſpecially in reſpect of God, who can either ſet an end to all when he will, or reſtraine their operations at his pleaſure. We know the Three Noble Children, when they came forth of the fiery oven, had not ſo much as any ſmell of the fire upon them. And therefore <hi>Durand</hi> profeſſeth that theſe things which are commonly accounted to come to paſſe moſt neceſſarily, doe indeed come to paſſe meerely contingently, in reſpect of the will of God.</p>
                                 <p>Nevertheleſſe we willingly profeſſe, that upon ſuppoſition of the will of God, that this or that ſhall come to paſſe, it followeth neceſſarily that ſuch a thing ſhall come
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56120:54"/>
to paſſe; like as upon ſuppoſition, that God knowes ſuch a thing ſhall come to paſſe, it followeth neceſſarily, that ſuch a thing ſhall come to paſſe; but how? not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily: but either neceſſarily according as ſome things are brought to paſſe by naturall agents, working neceſſarily after the manner aforeſaid; or contingently and freely according as ſome things are brought to paſſe, by rationall agents, working contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and freely. And therefore as touching the Queſtion of the Schooles about the root of contingency, <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> concurre in reſolving it into the Will of God, but with this difference; <hi>Scotus</hi> relates it into the will of God as a free agent. <hi>Aquinas</hi> reſolves it into the Will of God, as an efficacious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. For the will of God is ſo efficacious, that he can effectually procure, both that things neceſſary ſhall be brought to paſſe neceſſarily, and things contingent, contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently; and according he hath provided congruous cauſes hereof, to wit, both agents naturall for the produceing of neceſſary things neceſſarily, and agents rationall for the producing of contingent things, contingently and freely. Thus God preordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that <hi>Joſias</hi> ſhould burne the Prophets bones upon the Altar, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhould proclaim liberty to the Jewes, to returne into their Country; yet what ſober Divine hath made doubt, whether <hi>Joſias</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> did not herein, that which they did free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And as in doing, ſo in abſtaining from doing. For God ordained that Chriſts bones ſhould not be broken; as alſo that when the Jewes, all the Males, came up to the Lord thrice in the year to Jeruſalem, None of their neighbours ſhould deſire their land. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 24. Yet what ſober man ſhould make queſtion, whether the Souldiers did non as freely abſtaine from breaking Chriſts bones, as from ought elſe, and ſo likewiſe the bordering Nations did as freely abſtaine, from invading the land of Iſrael. And how often is this phraſe uſed in Scripture, <hi>Neceſſe eſt,</hi> of ſome things coming to paſſe, which yet came to paſſe as contingently and freely, as ought elſe. And unleſſe this be granted, that Gods determination is nothing prejudiciall to the freedome of the creatures will, either we muſt deny faith and repentance to be the gifts of God, or that they are works produced freely, and ſo every action plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the ſight of God. For the Scripture expreſſely profeſſeth, that God it is, who worketh in us every thing that is pleaſing in his ſight. And whatſoever God workes in us, or beſtows upon us in time, the ſame he determined, to work in us, and to beſtow upon us from everlaſting. For he worketh all things according to the counſell of his will <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 11. and the counſell of his Will was everlaſting, it being the ſame with God himſelfe.</p>
                                 <p>Now I come to the ſecond.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. And that is this. That all mens ends are unalterable and indetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the power of their Wills; and this he ſaith is upon the matter all one.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. Now this is moſt untrue, there being a vaſt difference between the actions of men, and the ends of men; The ends of men being the works of God. And what a monſter ſhall he be in the Church of God, that with <hi>Vorſtius</hi> ſhall dare to affirme, that all the works of God, were not determined from everlaſting; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing determined, they are alterable, and that in ſuch ſort, as to be otherwiſe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable by the wills of men; eſpecially conſidering that the very acts of mens wills, being wrought by God, (as all ſides now a daies confeſſe) it conſequently followes that they were alſo determined from everlaſting, by the Will and Counſell of God. What ſhould I alleage the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of Ireland for this? <hi>God from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity did by his unchangeable Counſell ordaine, whatſoever in time ſhould come to paſſe: yet ſo as thereby no violence is offered to the wills of the reaſonable creatures, and neither the liberty nor contingency of ſecond cauſes is taken away, but eſtabliſhed rather.</hi> There is no Arminian that I know dares deny, either that every act of man is wrought by God, or that, look what God doth work in time, the ſame he did before all time decree, and that from everlaſting. I know there is a main, and a moſt Atheiſticall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between us on one part, but I doe not find them willing to ſhew their hornes directly therein, but carry the matter ſo, as if they would obtrude upon us the acknowledgement, either of the temporall (not eternall) condition of decrees divine, or at leaſt of their alterable nature; whereas themſelves dare not plainly manifeſt themſelves, to be of any ſuch Atheiſticall beliefe. Let us inſtance in particular: Let the ſalvation of ſome, and damnation of others, be the ends this Author meaneth. Now dare any of them with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56120:55"/>
face profeſſe, that the ſalvation of the elect, and damnation of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate was not from everlaſting determined by God. Be the ſupream ends of God concerning man, the manifeſtation of his glory in the way of mercy on ſome, in the way of vindicative juſtice on others. Dare any of them profeſſe, that any of theſe ends are not from everlaſting determined by God; or being ſo determined, dare they profeſſe, that theſe divine decrees are alterable, or poſſible to be undetermined by the will of the creature? What a prodigious aſſertion were either of theſe? If they dare not ſay, Gods will is changeable, What an unſhamefac'd courſe is this, to obtrude upon us an alterable, that is, a changeable condition of Gods decrees? But perhaps you may ſay, here is no mention at all made of Gods decrees, but of mans ends. And I willingly confeſſe there is not. And I am perſwaded, this Author dares not in plain termes profeſſe, that Gods decrees are alterable. But hereby you may perceive, and have a manifeſt document of the illuſions of Satan, and how mens carnall affections, which are more in love with errour then truth, doe make them to ſhut their eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the one, and open them unto the other. It were a very harſh thing to ſay plainly, that Gods decrees are alterable, and that being determined by him, they might be undone, or made undetermined by the wills of men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Devill finds a means to draw us, to entertain the ſame blaſphemous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, not barefac'd, but hoodwickt as it were, and that is by changing the phraſe. For though it be uncouth to heare of an alterable condition of Gods decrees, yet it ſeems nothing harſh to diſcourſe of the alterable condition of mens ends. But give me leave to unmask the Witch, and make it appeare how the Devill gulls us in this.</p>
                                 <p>Mens ends are either ſo called, as intended by man himſelfe, or as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted by God. If this Author ſpeak of mens ends, as intended by man himſelfe, wee willingly grant, that they are alterable at his pleaſure; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Man intends one thing to day, he may intend another thing to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, he intends one thing this houre, he may intend another thing the next, and at his pleaſure reverſe his former intentions. And no marvail, conſidering that man partly is of a fickle diſpoſition in reſpect of his affections, ſtudious of change, and ſubject to innovation as the Moone; partly of an improvident di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition, he knows not what a Yeare, what a Month, what a Day, what an houre may bring forth. And therefore though never ſo wiſe and conſtant in his courſes, yet may he have juſt cauſe to change his reſolutions and purpoſes. But of ſuch ends of man, to wit, as intended by man, it is manifeſt this Author ſpeaks not.</p>
                                 <p>But of ends appointed by God, theſe be the ends he will have to be altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and determinable anew by the wills of men, which cannot be without the alteration and change of Gods purpoſes and intentions, which is as much as to ſay, without the change and revocation of Gods decrees. And an end not yet actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exiſting, but only in intention, can admit of no other alteration then in inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which this Author conſidering not, though perhaps he abhorres to ſay Gods decrees are changeable and alterable, and ſhuts out ſo uncouth an aſſertion at the fore-doore, yet as it were by a back-doore to receive it in, and in the dark and muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or veyled only with a different phraſe, a different expreſſion; Yet forthwith he takes a new courſe; For whereas by the word <hi>unalterable,</hi> he did imply that Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees concerning mens ends, ſhould be of an alterable condition; in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing he changeth his tone, and will not have the ends of man to be determined by God at all, but left unto man to be determined; as when he ſaith, <hi>In vaine is our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the actions, if the end which they drive at be pitched and determined.</hi> Whereby it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, he will not have the end whereunto men drive to be determined. And this end can be no other then ſalvation; for that alone I take to be that whereto men drive, and which they labour to attaine, every one naturally ſeeking after <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> after happineſſe. So that in the iſſue it comes to this, The ſalvation of this Author is not yet determined by God, but left to be determined by his will, and that I take to be in the way of a moving cauſe, and that moving cauſe I gueſſe to be, his finall perſeverance in faith and repentance, whereupon and not till then, ſhall this mans ſalvation be determined by God, as much as to ſay, that Gods decrees are as meerly temporall as are the executions of them. And herein this Author doth exactly agree with Doctor <hi>Jackſon</hi> perhaps being ſo happy as to underſtand him, or perhaps being ſo happy as to light upon an interpreter of him
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56120:55"/>
ſome one that breaths the ſame ſpirit of oppoſition to Gods truth, and that after the ſame way. For ſometimes the Doctor pleads for a revocable condition of the divine decrees. For the Pope never bindes his hands by any Grant he makes; and why ſhould God bind his hands by any decree he makes? eſpecially conſidering that God hath more wiſdome and goodneſſe to manage ſuch authority then the Pope. But if it be diſhoneſty for a man to take liberty to break his promiſes, I pray what goodneſſe is required to the managing thereof? Yet that Doctor keeps his courſe in diſcourſing of an impotent immutability, and ſaith, it is indecent to attribute any ſuch immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility unto God; whereas immutability is a notion which connotates no power of doing at all, but only a power of ſuffering, and formally denotes the negation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And what madneſſe is it to ſay, that the leſſe power God hath of receiving change, the leſſe power he hath of working? Yet this is not all; He hath another device anſwerable to the latter courſe of this Author, and that is, that Nothing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any mans ſalvation or damnation, is determined by God before he is borne, or before his death: and to that purpoſe he ſaith that God is ſtill decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as if hitherto he had not decreed ought. And would you know of whom he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this? <hi>Rogers</hi> in his expoſition of the Articles of the Church of England, a Book de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to Arch-Biſhop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> &amp; <hi>allowed by the lawfull authority of the Church of England,</hi> writing upon the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article, and delivering his ſecond propoſition, collected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence, in this forme, Predeſtination hath been from everlaſting; when he comes to ſet forth the Adverſaries of this truth, <hi>Thoſe wrangling Sophisters,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are deceived, who becauſe God is not included within the compaſſe of any time, but hath all things to come as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent before his eyes, doe ſay, that God he did not in the time long agoe paſt only, but ſtill in the time preſent likewiſe doth Predeſtinate.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p n="2">2. Conſider we the reaſon he gives for ſo ſhamefull an aſſertion, as touching the alterable condition of Gods decrees, or as touching the ends of men, as yet undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by God, In vaine, ſaith he, is freedome in the actions, if the end which they drive at, be determined. Here, Firſt, we have a wild phraſe <hi>Freedome in actions.</hi> For by freedome we underſtand an active power of working after a certain manner, which power is found in the will, not in the actions. Secondly, a bare avouching that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe God as yet hath left the ends of men living undetermined, or in caſe he hath determined them, unleſſe theſe determinations of his be alterable, Freedome of Will is given in vaine; as much as to ſay, unleſſe we admit of ſuch monſtrous aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the freedome of mans Will is in vaine. But we ſay this conſequence is moſt untrue, and we give our reaſon for it. For whether ſalvation or damnation be the ends he meaneth, no creature is capable of either, but only creatures rationall; and the one being beſtowed by way of reward, and the other inflicted by way of puniſhment, each of theſe preſuppoſeth freedome of Will in the parties thus procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with: Or whether the ends are the manifeſtation of Gods vindicative and remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerative juſtice, for the ſame reaſon now ſpecified, each of theſe doth neceſſarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak freedome of Will in them, who after either way are made uſeleſſe on whom the glory of God is to be manifeſted. When he addes ſaying <hi>Omnis actio</hi> is <hi>propter ſinem.</hi> This altogether concernes the ends intended, and propoſed by the author of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nothing concernes the ends propoſed by another. And the ends of a man propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by himſelfe, are either ſupreame or intermediate, ſtill every action deliberate (for ſo alone it holds) tends to one end or other, which man himſelfe intends. The ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream end of every one is his chief good; but as touching that wherein this conſiſts, all doe not agree. Some place it in wealth, ſome in pleaſure, ſome in honour, ſome in virtuous life. By the light of Grace we are taught, that as we are creatures, our end, which we ſhould propoſe unto our ſelves, is the glorifying of God our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, though there were neither reward nor puniſhment. But if there be a glorious reward to be gotten by it, and a dreadfull puniſhment to be ſuffered of them, that ſeek the ſatisfying of their own luſts, and not the glory of God, this is a double hedge unto us, to keep us in the good waies of the Lord, and to move us to make ſtrait ſtepps unto him; but ſurely the end of the creature, ſtill is the glorifying or God that made him. God makes it his care to provide for us, let our care be to glorify him; for ſeeing all things are from him, therefore all things muſt be for him; and ſeeing we are reaſonable creatures, and know this we muſt goe on, in conforming our ſelves hereunto, and ſeeking his glory. And albeit this Author may conceive, that ſalvation is the end he aimes at, yet can I
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56120:56"/>
not beleeve that he makes damnation the end that any man drives at. Nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fit to be a mans end, but that which hath <hi>rationem Boni,</hi> which ſurely damnation hath not.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. His Annotations as touching the three Opinions propoſed by him, come to be conſidered in the next place; and theſe are two.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. The Subſtance and Formality of them, which, as he ſaith is an unavoidable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mens actions and ends whatſoever they be. And in this, he ſaith, all of them agree, all holding that in all things, undeclinable Fates, and inſuperable neceſſity doe domincere. Whereunto I anſwer, that this is contradictory to his own premiſes, as touching the third Opinion. For againſt the Maintainers of Gods abſolute decree, he did formerly object only disjunctively, that either all mens actions were abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, that is unavoidable, or at leaſt, that mens ends were unavoidable; which is to inferre, that but one of them is avoidable; but here he profeſſeth (as upon that which he had formerly delivered) that by the Third Opinion, both mens actions and their ends were unavoidable. And as for the ſecond Opinion of the Manichees, I find no mention of the unavoidable condition, either of mans actions or ends at all, in the Relation thereof, by thoſe who have moſt ſtudied their Hiſtory. And as for the Stoicks, I no where find, that they denied the liberty of mens will, or that it was in mans power, either to forbeare the doing of that he doth, or to doe the things he forbears to doe; but rather the contrary, that they made choyce, ſome of them at leaſt, (though <hi>Auſtin</hi> delivers it without any ſuch diſtinction) to exempt the wills of men from ſubjection unto Fate: though I deny not, but that many vain diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes might be differently entertained by them, having no better light to guide them, then the light of nature, and wanting that which God hath in great mercy vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed unto us, the light of grace, and that in very plentifull manner. Much leſſe doe I find by them, that any thing came to paſſe, <hi>invito Deo.</hi> Though I willingly confeſſe, that ſuch a generation hath riſen up in theſe daies, affirming that God willeth and deſireth the ſalvation of all men, and yet the greater part of men are damned. And what is to come to paſſe, <hi>invito Deo,</hi> if this be not, I willingly profeſſe I know not.</p>
                                 <p>But <hi>Melancthon,</hi> he ſaith, doth not ſpare to call this abſolute decree, <hi>Fatum Stoicum, Tabulas Parcarum, and to charge the Church of Ceneva, with labouring to bring in the Stoicks er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, as appears by Melancthons Epistle to Peucer, and Beza's confeſsion in the life of Calvin.</hi> To all which I anſwer.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. That this Author either was better read in <hi>Melancthon</hi> then in <hi>Luther,</hi> or no ſo juſt matter could he find in <hi>Luther,</hi> to cry down the abſolute nature of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</p>

Within two years after I find a Letter written by <hi>Calvin</hi> unto <hi>Melancthon,</hi> wherein he profeſſeth his joy of their agreement, as touching the main poynt, in that whereabout their opinions were asked, albeit with ſome difference in certain particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, it is Epiſt. 63. amongſt thoſe of <hi>Calvins,</hi> and the words are theſe. <hi>Deo autem maximas gratias agere non deſino, qui dedit ut in ejus quaeſtionis ſummâ de quâ rogati eramus, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae nostrae congruerent. Tametſi enim paululum eſt diſcriminis in particulis quibuſdam, de re ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ipſâ optime inter nos convenit.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>The ſecond Annotation of this Author is, the circumſtance or the ground of the three opinions mentioned. The Stoicks deriving their neceſſity from the Starres or firſt matter; The Manichees from the two ſupream cauſes; And the Authors of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56120:57"/>
third, from the peremptory decree of Almighty God. And that in this difference, the Stoicks and the Manichees have the better, it being better (as he ſaith) to derive the neceſſity of evill actions, or unhappy events, from an evill God, or from the courſe of nature, then from the decree of that God who is infinitely good. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the opinion is all one, the ground wherein they differ, is but accidentall to the errour.</p>
                                 <p>To this I anſwer.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. Is it ſo indeed, Better to derive the neceſſity of unhappy events, from an evill God, or from courſe of nature, then from the decree of God? Is not God then to be accounted the author of evill in the way of puniſhment? Is there any evill in the Citty, and the Lord hath not done it? Or doth it leſſe become him to be the author <note place="margin">Amos 2. Ier. 9. 24.</note> of affliction then of proſperity? Doth not the Lord in the ſame place, and in the ſame manner profeſſe, that he delights in the execution of judgement, as well as of mercy?</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. As touching the neceſſity he ſpeaks of, whether in good, or in evill actions; conſider I pray his carriage, He did not object unto us, that we made all the actions of men abſolutely neceſſary, but either ſo, or the ends of men unavoidable. Yet here he ſuppoſeth the former to ſerve his own turne in this preſent crimination, he holds it up, as it were contrary to his own conſcience. We acknowledge the actions of men to be free, not one being performed by any, but in ſuch ſort, that they had power to forbear it, and ſtill have to forbear the like: But upon ſuppoſition of Gods decree, either to work in us any thing, that is pleaſing in his ſight (which to be his gracious courſe, the Apoſtle expreſly profeſſeth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 20.) or to permit any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular evill, we willingly profeſſe, that as well upon this, as upon Gods foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it followeth conſequently that <hi>neceſſe eſt,</hi> that ſuch a thing come to paſſe; but how? not neceſſarily, but agreeable to the condition of our reaſonable natures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingently and freely. And this <hi>Arminius</hi> in plain termes profeſſeth in the poynt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, to wit, ſuppoſing God permits a man to will this or that evill; <hi>Neceſſe eſt ut nullo argumentorum genere perſuadeatur ad nolendum, Exam. pag.</hi> 153. But I will farther diſplay the doctrine of theſe Arminians, and prove, Firſt, that no evill comes to paſſe, but that God did will it. Secondly, that never was there any greater neceſſity known to the World, then that which theſe men bring upon good and evill actions, a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that binds the Lord himſelfe.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. As touching the firſt; Theſe words of <hi>Arminius</hi> are well known, <hi>Deus voluit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabum menſuram ſcelerum ſucrum implere.</hi> But I will prove it by their Doctrine of <hi>ſcientia Media:</hi> For hereby they maintain, that God foreſeeth by what motives ſinne will be hindered, or not hindered, without any prejudice to the liberty of the creatures will; As alſo that God in the ſtorehouſe of his wiſdome, hath ſuch ſtore of morall impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as that he knows thereby, how to hinder any ſinne if it pleaſed him. His words are theſe, <hi>Praeter illa ſufficientia impedimenta, etiam efficacia habet in ſuo ſapientiae &amp; potentiae promptuario, quibus productis certò &amp; infallibiliter peccatum impediretur.</hi> And this is the difference with him, between a ſufficient impediment of ſinne, and impediment effectuall. Effectuall is that upon the uſe whereof, he knows full well, that ſinne will be hindered. Sufficient is that upon the uſe whereof, ſinne will not be hindered, and this is known to the Lord from everlaſting. Now let them tell me, why would not God make choyce to uſe ſuch an impediment, which he knew would prove effectuall, but ſuch rather, as he knew would prove ineffectuall. Doth it not manifeſtly appear hereby, that it is Gods will, that ſinne ſhall come to paſſe by his permiſſion? Like as the Scripture is expreſſe to this purpoſe, as where it is ſaid, that <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> with the Gentiles, and people of Iſrael were gathered together againſt the holy Sonne of God, to doe that which Gods hand, and his counſell, had foredetermined to be done. Now this is well known to have been no leſſe then the ignominious handling and crucifying of the Sonne of God. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 28. And <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 17. God put into the hearts of the Kings to doe his will, and to give their Kingdomes to the Beaſt, as much as to ſay, to uſe their Regall power, to the ſupporting of Antichriſt, which we know was in part by Maſſacring the Saints of God.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. Now to diſcover the ſtrange neceſſity, that theſe men bring in upon all things: It cannot be denied, but that God knoweth all future things, before they come to paſſe. Therefore they are preſuppoſed to be future in order of reaſon before God, knows them to be future; therefore all things future, are either ſuch by neceſſity of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56120:57"/>
nature, or by ſome cauſe; not by any cauſe, for if there were any cauſe hereof, to wit, to make them paſſe out of the condition of things meerly poſſible of their own nature, into the condition of things future, then this cauſe ſhould be found either within God or without God. Not without God can any cauſe hereof be found. For this paſſage of things, out of the condition of things meerly poſſible, into the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things future, was from everlaſting, therefore the cauſe hereof muſt have exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence from everlaſting. But nothing was everlaſting, <hi>Extra Deum,</hi> out of God; Therefore if any cauſe hereof be to be found, it muſt be within God; otherwiſe it muſt be confeſſed, that all things became future by abſolute neceſſity of nature. If to help this, they will deviſe ſomething within the nature of God, to be the cauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, let them tell us what that is. Not the Science of God, for all confeſſe, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the divine will, Gods knowledge is the cauſe of nothing. If they ſay, the will of God, they concurre with us in embracing the ſame Opinion, which they ſo much abhorre. Nothing remaines to fly unto, but the Eſſence of God; If they plead, that I demand, whether the Eſſence of God working freely, be the cauſe of the futurition of all things, or as working neceſſarily? If as working freely, that is as much as to confeſſe in expreſſe termes, that Gods will is the cauſe thereof: But if they ſay the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence is the cauſe hereof, as working neceſſarily, hence it followes, that all things good and evill come from God, as working by neceſſity of nature. See I pray and conſider the abominable, and Atheiſticall opinions, that theſe Arminians doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>providently caſt themſelves upon, when they ſtretch their witts to overthrow Gods providence, as it is carryed in the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of Ireland, which is this, <hi>God from all Eternity, did by his unchangeable Counſell ordaine whatſoever in time ſhould come to paſſe; yet ſo as thereby no violence is offered to the wills of the reaſonable creatures, and neither the liberty nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency of ſecond cauſes is taken away, but eſtabliſhed rather.</hi>

                                 <p>In the Concluſion, that which he vaunts of, as touching the Fathers, is meer wind; for he gives you nothing but his word for it; which of what credit it deſerves to be, I leave to the indifferent to judge. And as for the plucking up of the rootes of vertue which he fables of: Conſider I pray, what Sect of Philoſophers were ever known to be more vertuous then the Stoicks; and how was <hi>Zeno</hi> himſelfe honoured by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians, for his grave and vertuous converſation? Hath not <hi>Eraſmus</hi> delivered it, as out of the mouth of <hi>Hierome,</hi> that <hi>Secta Stoicorum</hi> was <hi>Secta ſimillima Chriſtianae?</hi> Yet I no where find, that they brought in any neceſſity, that was not ſubordinate to the Will of the ſupream God: But theſe Arminians bring in a neceſſity of nature from without God, to make him to doe this, or that, if he doth any thing; or at leaſt, to make God himſelfe a neceſſary Agent, devoyd of all liberty and freedome, contrary to that of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> concerning the manner of Gods working, namely, that it is, <hi>Nullo neceſſitatis obſequio,</hi> but <hi>ſolo libertatis arbitrio.</hi> But according to theſe Divines it muſt be quite contrary, <hi>Nullo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>1. Gods affection to men ſet forth <list>

                           <p n="2">2. The perſons in whoſe deſtruction he delighteth not, wicked men, ſuch as for the rejecting of grace dye and are damned. If God have no pleaſure in their death, much leſſe in the death of men, either altogether innocent, or tainted only with originall ſinne.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The truth of this affection, <hi>as I live; cupit ſihi credi</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tertullian, Lib. de paenit. cap.</hi> 4.) God would faine have us to believe him, when he ſaith I will not the death of him that dyeth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he bindes his ſpeech with an oath: <hi>O beatos nos quorum cauſa Deus jurat, O miſerrimos ſi nec juranti Domino credimus.</hi> Happy are we for whoſe ſakes the Lord vouchſafeth to ſweare, but moſt unhappy if we believe him not when he ſwears. Now if God delight not in the deſtruction of wicked men, he did never out of his own pleaſure take ſo many millions of men lying in the fall, and ſeale them up by an abſolute decree under invincible damnation: for ſuch a kind of decreeing men to everlaſting death, is quite oppoſite to a delight in mens eternall life.</p>

                              </head>
                              <p>TO ſay that this or that opinion is untrue, becauſe it doth <hi>in terminis</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict places of Scripture, is a very ſuperficiary conſideration: yet it is not the firſt time that I have found it to drop from an Arminians penne: But that it is a very ſuperficiary conſideration, I prove thus; For to deny God the Sonne to be equall to the Father, is <hi>in terminis</hi> to contradict a pregnant place of Scripture, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. Where it is expreſſely ſaid of God the Sonne, that he thought it no robbery to be equall to the Father: yet notwithſtanding it is agreeable to that of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, where he ſaith, the Father is greater then I; and ſo <hi>vice verſâ.</hi> In like manner to ſay that God cannot repent, is <hi>in terminis</hi> to contradict pregnant places of Scripture: again to ſay that God can repent, is <hi>in terminis</hi> to contradict other as pregnant places of Scripture; yet neither of theſe is unſound; becauſe each phraſe is agreeable to Scripture in ſome place or other. And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe <hi>in terminis</hi> only to contradict the Scripture, is not to contradict the Scripture; But when we contradict the meaning of Scripture, then and not till then, are we juſtly ſaid to contradict the Scripture; And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe the word of God conſiſts not in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward barke or bone of the letter, but in the inward pith and marrow of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And as for contradiction unto Scripture <hi>in terminis,</hi> it may eaſily be proved, that to deny Gods delight in the deſtruction of obſtinate ſinners, is to contradict a very <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Nec putemus in verbis Scripturarum Evangelium eſſe, ſed in ſenſu, non in ſuperficie, ſed in medulla, non in ſermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num foliis, ſed in radice ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis.</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. in Epiſt. ad Galat. c. 1.</note> pregnant place of Holy Scripture, as namely <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24, 25, 26. <hi>Becauſe I have called and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand and no man regarded; but ye have ſet at naught all my counſell, and would none of my reproofe: I will alſo laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your feare cometh; when your feare cometh as deſolation, and your deſtruction as a Whirlewind.</hi> And yet never a whit the more, is any contradiction found in Scripture for this: becauſe though they contradict each the other <hi>in terminis,</hi> yet there is no contradiction if we conſider the true meaning: As for example, it is both true that the Father is greater then the Sonne, as touching the Sonnes Manhood; And the Sonne equall to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as touching his Godhead. So of repentance, it cannot be attributed to God as it ſignifies change of mind or counſell; but it may be attributed unto God, as it ſignifies change of ſentence; according to that of <hi>Gregory, Deus mutat ſententiam, conſilium nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam.</hi> So as touching Gods pleaſure or delight in the death of a ſinner, as it is the deſtruction of the creature he delighteth not in it; but as it is a juſt puniſhment of the impenitent creature, he delights therein: Thus <hi>Piſcator</hi> reconciles it, on <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. v. 23, &amp; 32. Surely God delights in the execution of juſtice, as well as in the execution of mercy, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>I am the Lord which exerciſeth loving kindneſſe, judgement, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe in the earth, for in theſe things I delight ſaith the Lord.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="2">2. Here firſt, the Author declines from the former phraſe, of having no pleaſure in the death of a ſinner, to <hi>not willing</hi> the death of a ſinner; which phraſes have no ſmall difference, as <hi>Piſcator</hi> obſerves upon that in <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33. 11. for ſaith he, <hi>poteſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo velle id quo non delectatur, ut aegrotus poteſt velle potum amarum, quo non delectatur, poteſt enim eum velle non perſe, ſed propter aliud, nempe ad recuper andam valetudinem.</hi> And to deny that God willeth the death of as many as dye, is <hi>in terminis</hi> to contradict a pregnant place of Scripture, as where it is ſaid, <hi>that God worketh all things according to the counſell of his will, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 11. And therefore ſeeing the inflicting of death is Gods work he muſt will it: But this Author is more happy for invention then his fellowes: For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as others of his opinion, work upon the place as it is rendred in the vulgar Latine, <hi>Nolo mortem peccatoris:</hi> this Author hath found out an argument from the very phraſe of our laſt Engliſh tranſlation, to advantage his cauſe, as when from Gods having no pleaſure in the death of a ſinner, he quaintly inferres, therefore God doth not of meer pleaſure, will or decree their death; But how ſuperficiary this is alſo, and how fouly it falls in the iſſue, upon the Author himſelfe (as uſually it falleth out with men, that affect new and quaint inventions) I hope to diſcover in due place.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="105" facs="tcp:56120:60"/>
Farther obſerve; that place, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33. 11. <hi>I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked,</hi> according to our laſt Engliſh tranſlation, and that, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. 23. <hi>Have I any pleaſure at all that the wicked ſhould dye,</hi> doe differently render one and the ſame phraſe in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, <hi>in the death of the wicked, Ezech.</hi> 33. 11. which is word for word according to the Hebrew; <hi>that the wicked ſhould dye Ezech.</hi> 18. 23. which being not according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe termes of the originall, it followeth that hereby, our Tranſlators did expound the ſenſe of the Hebrew, which is word for word, in the death of the wicked, and ſo accordingly, that phraſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 32. <hi>in the death of him that dieth,</hi> importeth as much as this, <hi>that he who dyeth ſhould dye.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And as for <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that which he alleadgeth out of him, neither makes for him nor againſt us: we all believe what the Prophet delivereth; but we enquire about the ſenſe of it; But in the ſame place <hi>Tertullian</hi> interprets the place not abſolutely but comparatively, thus, <hi>Vivo inquit Dominus, &amp; paenitentiam malo quam mortem,</hi> and indeed thus it is accommodated more then once in the Book of Common prayer, as firſt in the generall abſolution; then, in one of the Collects upon Good-Friday: There is a double pleaſure, that God may be ſaid to take in the one, but a ſingle pleaſure only in the other. For in the death of an impenitent ſinner, God delights only in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of juſtice: but in the converſion of ſuch a one that he may live, God delights both in the execution of mercy, which is equivalent to his delight taken in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of judgement, and over and above he delights in their repentance; For like as of ſuch as fall from God, it is ſaid, <hi>His ſoule hath no pleaſure in them:</hi> ſo of ſuch as turne unto him, it is as true, that <hi>his ſoule hath pleaſure in them.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="3">3. But give we him leave to enjoy the interpretation he affecteth, yet conſider I pray, whether he doth not enjoy it <hi>tanquam Diis iratis,</hi> and to his bane: for marke I pray his argument, and conſider whether I doe not from the ſame argument, moſt ſtrongly conclude againſt him.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. His argument runnes thus, <hi>If God delighteth not in the deſtruction of wicked men, he did never out of his own pleaſure, take ſo many millions of men lying in the fall, and ſeale them up by an abſolute decree under invincible damnation.</hi> Now from the rule of contraries, I here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence diſpute thus; If this be a good conſequence which he makes, then on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it followes, that ſeeing God doth take pleaſure and delight in mans eternall life (as this Author expreſſely acknowledgeth) therefore he did out of his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, take ſo many million of men lying in the fall, and ſeale them up by an abſolute decree under invincible ſalvation. Now this concluſion is as directly oppoſite unto him in the poynt of election, as his concluſion is oppoſire to ours in the poynt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. And my argument muſt be of the ſame force and validity with his; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Contrariorum contraria eſt ratio.</hi> Yet I will not content my ſelfe with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. Therefore conſider I pray in the next place, the true meaning of this phraſe <hi>I have no pleaſure:</hi> in theſe places of the Prophet, the Author himſelfe though he doth not plainly profeſſe what is the meaning of it, as it became him to doe, and not to depend upon colour of words ſuitable; yet by his drift he manifeſts the meaning of it to be this, that God doth not bring death upon a ſinner, of meere pleaſure, but being provoked thereunto, (and that according to the purport of the firſt place <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zech.</hi> 18.) by the ſinner himſelfe; and alſo, (according to the purport of the ſecond place) only in caſe of impenitency. And I concurre with him in this: And ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be delivered in the ſame ſenſe with that <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 32, 33. <hi>For though he cauſe griefe</hi> (to wit by reaſon of mens ſinnes v. 39.) <hi>yet will he have compaſsion according to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his mercies,</hi> (to wit, in caſe he repents <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. 7. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 10. 16.) For <hi>he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</hi> Mark I pray, <hi>not willingly;</hi> to wit, in as much as he is provoked thereunto by ſinne, and by refuſall to repent. And this is in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Scripture phraſes, <hi>not to take pleaſure in the afflicting and grieving of men.</hi> For if any work be ſuch, as wherein pleaſure is taken; we need not enquire after a cauſe why it is done, but though no pleaſure be taken in it, yet for ſome benefit redounding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, a man may doe it, yea though it be grievous and bitter unto him: As a ſick man is willing to take a bitter potion for the recovery of his health. Now come we to the argument: <hi>God takes no pleaſure in the death of any; therefore he doth not of pleaſure inflict death.</hi> We willingly grant it, in as much as he never inflicts eternall death on any, that doth not dye in ſinne unrepented of: And as he doth not inflict death on any of meere pleaſure, that is, without juſt cauſe on the part of him that dyeth, deſerving it: So we
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56120:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
willingly confeſſe, that God did never decree to inflict death on any without juſt cauſe on the Malefactors part deſerving death. And this is the uttermoſt whereunto this Authors argument can be extended. And all our Divines unanimouſly confeſſe, that God neither decreed to damne any man of his meer pleaſure, but for his ſinne wherein he died without repentance.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. Obſerve the cunning of this Diſputer, to deceive himſelfe firſt, and then to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe his readers: For whereas he ſhould have proceeded in his argument by degrees, thus; <hi>God hath no pleaſure in the death of a ſinner, therefore he doth not of his own pleaſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict death;</hi> and thence proceed (if he had thought good) to conclude the like of Gods decree, thus; <hi>if God doth not of his ownpleaſure inflict, then neither doth he of his own pleaſure decree to inflict death and damnation:</hi> This author leaping over the inflicting of death, as a block in his way (for the laſt conſequence would have betrayed its own naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) flyeth at firſt to the application of it, to Gods decree: Now I willingly grant, <hi>that Gods having no pleaſure in the death of a ſinner, doth ſignify,</hi> that God inflicts death on no man without a cauſe, for that were of meer pleaſure to inflict: But dares he here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence inferre, <hi>therefore God doth not of meer pleaſure decree to inflict death and damnation on man for ſinne,</hi> for to this alone comes all the force of this argument. Now to ſhew the vanity of this conſequence, conſider I pray.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. It is as if he ſhould argue thus in plain termes; ſinne is alwaies the meritorious cauſe of damnation; therefore ſinne is the meritorious cauſe of Gods eternall decree of damnation: Now this Enthymeme hath no force any farther, then it may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into a Categoricall Syllogiſme; and this Enthymeme is reducible into no other Syllogiſme then this; Damnation is the decree of Damnation, ſinne is the cauſe of Damnation, therefore ſinne is the cauſe of the decree of damnation. But in this Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme the propoſition containes a notorious untruth: Or thus, Sinne is the cauſe of damnation; therefore the foreſight of ſinne is the cauſe of the decree of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But this Enthymeme is not reducible unto any categoricall Syllogiſme at all, for as much as it conſiſts of foure termes; all which muſt be clapt into the Syllogiſme whereunto it is reduced, and conſequently make that Syllogiſme conſiſt of foure termes, which utterly overthrowes the illative forme thereof.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. We may as well diſpute thus; <hi>Good works as well as faith and repentance are the diſpoſing cauſe unto ſalvation,</hi> therefore good works as well as faith and repentance (or the foreſight of them) are the diſpoſing cauſe to Gods election, or to the decree of ſalvation.</p>
                              <p>But ſhall I tell you, the chiefe flouriſh whereupon this Author (and uſually the Arminians) doth inſiſt in this his looſe argumentation, I conceive it to be this; they hope their credulous readers, unexpert in diſtinguiſhing between Gods eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and the temporall execution thereof, will be apt hereupon to conceit, that we maintain, that God doth not only of meer pleaſure decree whatſoever he decreeth, but alſo that he doth decree of meer pleaſure to damne men: which yet is utterly contrary (if I be not deceived) to the tenet of all our Divines: all concurring in this, that God in the execution of the decree of damnation, proceeds according to a Law, and not in the execution of reprobation only, but alſo in the execution of election. And the law is this, <hi>Whoſoever believes ſhall be ſaved, whoſoever believes not ſhall be damned,</hi> And like as he inflicteth not damnation, but by way of puniſhment, ſo he conferres not ſalvation but by way of reward. But in the execution of his decrees of election unto grace, and reprobation from grace; we willingly profeſſe that God proceeds according to no law given unto men, to prepare themſelves hereunto, but meerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his good pleaſure, having mercy on whom he will, and hardning whom he will: And this indeed is the criticall poynt of this controverſy: But neither this Author nor his complices (ſome of them of my knowledge) have any heart to deale on this. I come to his Second pregnant place as he calleth it.</p>

                              <p>I Willingly grant the word [all] in each place is of equall extent, but how? in the Apoſtles meaning in this place; that is, look in what ſenſe the Apoſtle takes the word [all] when he ſaith <hi>God hath concluded all under unbeliefe:</hi> in the ſame ſenſe he takes the word [all] when he ſayeth, <hi>that he might have mercy upon all.</hi> And accordingly in caſe when he ſaith the one he meaneth by the word [all] no more but Jewes &amp; Gentiles: it followes that when he ſaith <hi>God hath mercy on all,</hi> by the word [all] he underſtands no more then both Jewes and Gentile, and that is, certain nations of men only, not all men of all ſorts and conditions; And therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were granted him, that all men of all ſorts are unbelievers, yet unleſſe he can prove, that in this ſenſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of [all] in ſaying <hi>God hath concluded all under infidelity,</hi> let any one that is indifferent, judge whether this argument be of any force.

                           <p>IOhn 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Sonne, that whoſoever &amp;c.</hi> God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the World, that is, the whole lump of Man-kind, therefore God did not abſolutely hate the greateſt part of Man-kind. God loved it fallen into a guilt of ſinne and miſery, for he ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, as to ſend his Sonne to redeeme them; and a Saviour preſuppoſeth ſinne. He did not therefore hate the moſt of them conſidered in the fall, for love and hatred are contrary acts, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be exerciſed about the ſame Object. Many expoſitors (I know) doe take <hi>World</hi> here in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained ſenſe, and underſtand by it the company of the Elect, or the <hi>World of believers</hi> only, but they have little reaſon for it (in my opinion;) for, 1. I think there can be no place of Scripture alleadged wherein this word <hi>World</hi> eſpecially with the condition of <hi>whole,</hi> as in 1 Epiſt. of Iohn. 2. 2. (which is a place equivalent to this for the matter of it, and a comment upon it) I ſay (I think) no place can be produced where <hi>World</hi> doth ſignify only the Elect, or only believers; but it ſignifies either all men, or at leaſt, the moſt men, living in ſome certain place, and at ſome certain time, but without diſtinction of good and bad: or if it be uſed any where more reſtrainedly, it is applyed only to the wicked and Reprobate men, who are wedded in their affections to the World, and the tranſitory delights thereof, and therefore doe moſt properly deſerve this name.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Suppoſe it be granted that <hi>World</hi> in ſome Scriptures is reſtrained to the Elect, yet it cannot bear this ſignification here; becauſe,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The words then would have a bad and ſenſeleſſe conſtruction; for thus would they runne, <hi>God ſo loved the Elect that whoſoever believed in him ſhould not periſh &amp;c.</hi> And if they runne thus, then this would follow, there are two ſorts of the Elect, ſome that <hi>doe believe,</hi> and ſhall <hi>be ſaved;</hi> others that doe <hi>not believe,</hi> and ſhall be <hi>damned,</hi> which is a diviſion or diſtinction unknown in Divinity.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>Believers</hi> and <hi>Vnbelievers,</hi> damned and ſaved comprehend all Man kind, for there is no man but is one of theſe. Now World in this place includeth <hi>believers and unbelievers,</hi> the <hi>ſaved and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> (as appears moſt plainly to him that conſiders the words;) therefore it ſignifieth here all Man kind without exception of any.

                              <p>BE it the whole lump of man-kind (if that Lettice like his lipps.) I ſhould think by World, is meant <hi>homines in mundo degentes,</hi> men at any time living in the World without any reſtraint: But herehence it followeth not, that God doth not abſolutely hate the greateſt part of man-kind; which this Author ſhould have proved, but he doth not; therefore I will not only deny it, but diſprove it. Firſt therefore conſider, this love is only <hi>ſecundum Quid,</hi> in reference to mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, namely, ſo farre forth as in caſe they believe, they ſhall obtain everlaſting life through the Sonne of God: But if there were no farther love of God towards man, they might be damned, yea every Mothers ſonne for all this. Secondly, if faith it ſelfe be a gift of God, and God gives it not to all, but to ſome only, and thoſe but a few; (for even of them that are called few are choſen:) and withall if God hath ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely decreed to beſtow this grace only on a few, and deny it to the greateſt part of the World, will it not manifeſtly follow herehence, that if abſolutely to decree the denyall of faith be to hate, then ſurely God abſolutely hates the greateſt part of men, notwithſtanding this love here mentioned, albeit we extend it to all and every one. Therefore it became this Author to prove, that God is indifferent to give Faith to one as well as to another: and that either abſolutely, whence it would follow, that all and every one, ſhould both believe and be ſaved; or conditionally, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall repreſent unto us, what that condition is, whereupon God beſtowes faith on one, and for the want thereof, he refuſeth to beſtow faith on another. This is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry criticall poynt about the controverſies of Gods decrees. Here therefore he ſhould have ſhewed his ſtrength: For as for Gods purpoſe to damne, we willingly profeſſe, that as God damnes no man but for ſinne, ſo he purpoſeth to damne no man but for ſinne. But as for his purpoſe to give or deny the grace of regeneration, the grace of faith and repentance, we as readily profeſſe, that not the purpoſe only, but the very giving of faith and repentance, for the curing of infidelity and hardneſſe of heart in ſome, and the denying of it unto others, ſo to leave their naturall infidelity and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart uncured, proceeds meerely according to the good pleaſure of his will, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth;</hi> And by a cloud of teſtimonies out of <hi>Auſtin</hi> we can prove, that in this very ſenſe he underſtood the Apoſtle in that place. And indeed no other interpretation of that place, can with any modeſty be deviſed, or obtruded upon us. As for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming of all and every one by Chriſt, diſtinguiſheth that which the haters of Gods truth doe delight to confound. There is a redemption from the guilt of ſinne, and a redemption from the power of ſinne: <hi>For we are redeemed from our vaine converſation.</hi> Chriſt came into the World <hi>to diſſolve the works of the Devill:</hi> No greater works of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan then <hi>blindneſſe of heart,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. and <hi>hardneſſe of heart, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. laſt. The pardon of ſinne, and ſalvation, God beſtowes <hi>only on believers,</hi> and upon condition of faith: Now like as God is ready to beſtow theſe benefits on all and every one, and that for Chriſts ſake, in caſe they believe: ſo Chriſt hath merited pardon of ſinne and ſalvation for all and every one, in caſe they believe. Such is the ſufficiency of Chriſts merit, that if every one of <hi>Adams</hi> race ſhould believe, every one ſhould be ſaved: and this preſent Text proceeds upon this, namely, upon the ſufficiency of Chriſts merits. But enquire farther whether Chriſt did not merit for us the grace of faith, and if he did, whether abſolutely of conditionally; if abſolutely then all muſt believe <hi>de facto,</hi> and be ſaved; if conditionally, then faith is a grace, which God beſtowes on man conditionally. Now let this Author ſhew us what that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is, upon performance whereof by man, God will give him faith, and let
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56120:63"/>
him try whether he can carry himſelfe ſo warily herein, as not to plunge himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to plain Pelagianiſme. This poynt is a break-neck, or <hi>Crevecoeur</hi> unto all Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they generally avoyd the delivering of their minds clearly hereupon, as a man would avoyd a precipice. It is true ſome Divines doe interpret the word [World] here, of the Elect, as <hi>Piſcator; Rolloc</hi> doth not, making no mention of the Elect here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. And <hi>Piſcators</hi> meaning is no more then this, <hi>viz.</hi> that this love of God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of every gracious effect (I mean in the way of ſanctifying grace) determins on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Elect; for in all likelihood, he followed <hi>Calvin</hi> in this, <hi>Univerſalem notam appoſuit</hi> (ſaith <hi>Calvin) tum ut promiſcuè omnes ad vitae participationem invitet, tum ut praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat excuſationem incredulis.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe (ſaith he) pertaines <hi>nomen mundi, quo prius uſus eſt.</hi> And again, <hi>ſe toti mundo propitium oſtendit, quum ſine exceptione omnes ad fidem vocat:</hi> But here he ſubjoynes a caution, thus; <hi>Caeterum meminerimus ita communiter promit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti omnibus vitam ſi in Chriſto crediderint, ut tamen minime communis omnium ſit fides. Patet enim omnibus Chriſtus &amp; expoſitus eſt, ſolis tamen Electis oculos Deus aperit &amp; fide ipſum quaerant.</hi> So that this gracious promiſe is generall to all and every one, <hi>whoſoever believes ſhall be ſaved;</hi> But yet notwithſtanding if it ſhall appeare, that God gives the grace of faith, to none but to a certain number, (which are his Elect) it followes, that the effect of this love of God, to wit, Salvation ſhall in the iſſue redound to none but Gods Elect.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. As for the deſigning a place where the World is taken for the Elect; we need no ſuch place, as I have ſhewed; yet <hi>Piſcator</hi> conceives that ſo it is taken, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 17. <hi>That the World might be ſaved by him.</hi> But what think you of <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 15. <hi>Where the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting away of the Jewes is ſaid to be the reconciliation of the World.</hi> And that 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelfe.</hi> I ſay the reconciled World is only Gods Elect, for the reconciled are all ſaved, as I prove by the Apoſtles argument <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>If when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne, how much more being reconciled ſhall we be ſaved by his life. Ioh.</hi> 1. 29. <hi>The Lamb of God that taketh away the ſinnes of the World.</hi> Are their ſinnes taken away that are damned for them? And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 33. <hi>He gives life to the World;</hi> Is life given to any but to the Elect?</p>
                              <p n="2">2. The ſecond reaſons, why in this place it cannot be ſo taken, are in effect but one, and that a weake one:</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Becauſe, that they that underſtand it of the Elect, underſtand it ſo in no other ſenſe, but as I have expounded it.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. If I ſhould ſay of the twelve Apoſtles <hi>(Judas</hi> excluded, and <hi>Matthias</hi> ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his roome) that God ſo loved them, that he gave his only begotten Sonne, that whoſoever of them believed in him, ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life; who can deny, but that this was a truth accommodated unto them? but will it here hence follow, that among thoſe Apoſtles, ſome were believers ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers? Suppoſe all the World were Elect, and it pleaſed God to give them all Faith, ſhould this Doctrine be the leſſe true, whoſoever believes ſhall be ſaved? yet in this caſe it would not follow, that amongſt the World of men ſome were believers, and ſome unbelievers.</p>
                              <p>But whereas he faines, that ſome of our Divines ſhould interpret the word [World] here of Believers, that is ſuch a fiction as is incredible. I come to the fourth.</p>

That it is Gods will, that all men ſhould obtain an happy end, <hi>viz.</hi> Salvation. 2. That it is his will alſo, that they ſhould uſe and enjoy the means, which is the knowledge of his truth, that ſo they might obtain the end, the ſalvation of their ſoules; there is no let in God, but that all men may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and be ſaved, and therefore there is no abſolute will, that many thouſands of men ſhall never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nor be ſaved.</p>
                           <p>Two anſwers are uſually returned, which give me little ſatisfaction: The firſt is, that by All we are to underſtand all ſorts, and not every particular man in every ſort and condition. It is true that [all] is ſometimes ſo uſed in Scripture, but (I believe) not here: for the very Text ſhewes that we are to underſtand by it, the Individualls and not the kindes: v. 1. There is a duty enjoyned, <hi>I will that prayers and ſupplications be made for all men,</hi> and in this verſe the motive is annexed, <hi>God will have all to be ſaved;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, our charity muſt reach to all, whom God extends his love to: God will have all to be ſaved, therefore we muſt pray for all: Now in the duty All ſignifies every man, for no man though wicked and prophane, is to be excluded from our prayers; <hi>pray for them</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>that perſecute you;</hi> And <hi>pray</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle here) <hi>for Kings, and all that are in Authority,</hi> men in thoſe daies (though the greateſt) yet the worſt, yea very Wolves, and Lyons, and Bears of the Church; pray for them, and if for them, then for any other, thus in the duty it ſignifies every man; and if it doe ſo in the duty, it muſt have the ſame extent in the motive too; or elſe the motive will not reach home, nor have ſtrength enough to enforce the duty. The ſecond anſwer is, that God will have all to be ſaved with his revealed will, have Millions to be damned with his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret will. If this anſwer ſtand, then (in my underſtanding) theſe inconveniences will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That Gods words (which are his revealed will) are not interpretations of his mind and meaning, and by conſequence are not true; for <hi>Oratio quae non eſt mentis ſignificatio, ſimulatio eſt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. That there are two contrary willes in God; a ſecret will, that many Sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocably be damned; and a revealed will, that all the Sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> may be ſaved.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. That one of Gods wills muſt needs be bad, either the ſecret will, or the revealed; for of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries if the one be good, the other is bad; and ſo of Gods contrary wills, if the one be good, the other muſt needs be bad, for <hi>malum</hi> is <hi>contrarium bono.</hi>

Now albeit it be the conditionall will of God that all, and every one ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in caſe they believe, yet this hinders not, but that it may be the abſolute will of God, that many thouſands of men ſhall never be ſaved; as in caſe his will be to deny the grace of faith and repentance to many thouſands, as it is cleare and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable that he doth.</p>

Nay the Remonſtrants themſelves, and particularly an Arminian that I had to doe withall lately, ſpared not to profeſſe, that Election is abſolute; if ſo, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation alſo is abſolute; and I doubt not but that they will all confeſſe, that howbeit Gods will be, that all ſhould be ſaved, yet thouſands are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated.</p>

Suppoſe the Apoſtle had ſaid, it is the abſolute will of God, that all men ſhall be ſaved, yet I ſay it followes not herehence, but that by the abſolute will of God many might faile of falvation: for it was the abſolute will of God, that every foure footed beaſt ſhould be repreſented to <hi>Peter,</hi> let downe unto him in a linnen veſſell; yet nevertheleſſe it might be that many thouſands were not repreſented to him, and that by the will of God.</p>

Now the Specialls mentioned, are certain ſorts or conditions of men, as Kings, and ſuch as are in authority; therefore the generall [all] muſt in like manner be underſtood of all ſorts, and all conditions of men: upon this conſideration alſo it was that <hi>Auſtin</hi> did inſiſt, in the place before alleadged: <hi>Praeceperat</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus ut or aretur pro ſingulis hominibus, &amp; ſpecialiter addiderat pro Regibus, &amp; iis qui in ſublimita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ſunt, qui putari poterant faſtu &amp; ſuperbia ſeculari a fidei Chriſtianae humilitate abhorrere.

Hoc quippe Deus bonum judicavit, ut orationibus humilium dignaretur, praeſtare ſalutem ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limium.</hi> Now I come to conſider what this Author hath to ſay againſt this expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for he gives us very gravely to underſtand, that <hi>it gives him little ſatisfaction:</hi> we are therefore to expect ſome better ſatisfaction from him.</p>
                              <p>It is true that [all] is ſo uſed in Scripture, not only ſome times, but very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; let him come to inſtance in his ſenſe, we are ready to inſtance with him for ours. But <hi>the Text</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhewes we are to underſtand the individualls and not the kindes.</hi> Where firſt (I doubt) his ignorance, in underſtanding the diſtinction aright, is his beſt ground of oppoſition. When <hi>Auſtin</hi> urgeth for his interpretation, that of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes tything <hi>omne olus,</hi> every hearb, who doubts but they tythe Individuall hearbs. In like ſort when <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw in a veſſell let down unto him <gap reason="foreign">
                                    <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                                 </gap> every foure footed beaſt; no queſtion but Individuall beaſts were let down unto him, not every one of every kind, but of every kind or of moſt kinds, or of many kinds ſome, ſo that the meaning of the diſtinction is not to exclude all individualls (as this Author ſeems to carry the matter,) but only, to exclude a neceſſity of underſtanding all individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls of all ſorts. It is enough if God will ſave ſome of all ſorts, that is, of all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſome individualls. Then, ſeeing he undertakes out of the very Text, to give us better ſatisfaction, then either <hi>Auſtin</hi> or our Divines have hitherto received, it muſt needs be a ſhame for him to leave the preſent Text, and fetch grounds elſewhere, for the clearing of <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning here. Now let us obſerve, how congruouſly or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruouſly to his own undertakings, he carryeth himſelfe in this buſineſſe: of the duty enjoyned, and of the motive annexed, there is no queſtion: but whereas he ſhapes the coherence thus, and makes <hi>Paul</hi> in effect to ſpeak after this manner; <hi>our charity muſt reach to all to whom God extends his love to; God will have all to be ſaved, and therefore we muſt pray for all.</hi> Though all this were granted him, it makes nothing for him: but over and above here are cauſeleſſe errours more then enough:</p>
                              <p>For, firſt, our charity muſt extend farther then Gods love; was not <hi>Jacob</hi> bound to carry himſelfe charitably towards his brother <hi>Eſau?</hi> though Gods hatred of <hi>Eſau,</hi> we know was as ancient as his love to <hi>Iacob.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="2">2. We are not bound to extend our charity ſo far as God extends his love; for many thouſands there be in the World, (not to ſpeak of the Elect departed this life) towards whom it may be God extends his love, which yet are unknown to us; &amp; are we bound to pray for we know not whom. Again, Gods love, with this Author, is extended as farre as his will to ſave, and that is extended to all and every one: and unleſſe God be now changed, it muſt extend to them now after they are damned, and muſt our charity be extended towards them alſo? But he proceeds, let us proceed with him. <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>[all] in the duty ſignifies every man;</hi> but that we deny; he gives his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>for no man though wicked and prophane, is to be excluded from our Prayers.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Againſt this I have two exceptions, (and yet if the whole be granted him, it maketh nothing for him:) my firſt exception is this; he promiſed to give us ſatisfaction out of the Text it ſelfe; but who ſeeth not but that this rule of his, is brought in quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Text: I from the Text have proved, and from the coherence between the generall and the ſpeciall, that the ſpeciall being certain particular conditions of men, the generall [all] muſt conformably be underſtood of all conditions.</p>
                              <p>My ſecond exception is this; he obtrudes upon us, that <hi>no man, though wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, is to be excluded from our Prayers.</hi> I confeſſe I doe not find my ſelfe apt to exclude any from my prayers; but I cannot endure, that a bold fellow ſhould obtrude his
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56120:65"/>
rules upon us as Oracles. The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> forbids us to pray for them that ſinne a ſinne unto death. But let all this be granted, what then? <hi>If it extends to every one in the duty, it muſt have the ſame extent in the motive too;</hi> but this I deny; he ſaith, <hi>elſe the motive will not reach home, nor have ſtrength enough to enforce the duty:</hi> but this likewiſe I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and ſhew withall, how the motive ſhall reach home, and have ſtrength enough even to enforce this duty, according to this Authors accommodation of it; albeit God hath a will not to ſave all and every one, but of all ſorts and all conditions ſome; of Kings ſome, of them that are in Authority ſome; For ſeeing God ſaves of all ſorts ſome, why ſhould not every Chriſtian Subject, pray for his Prince and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, ſeeing it may be they are thoſe ſome, whom God means to ſave, even of the ranke of Princes, of the ranke of Governors, and of men in Authority. For God hath not revealed to us, who they are whom he hath elected, and who they are whom he hath reprobated. If he had, <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us what we ſhould doe in that caſe, <hi>De Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.

                              </p>
                              <p n="3">3. As for the ſecond interpretation; I doe not find it ſo uſuall with our Divines: <hi>Cajetan</hi> diſtinguiſheth here between <hi>voluntas ſigni</hi> and <hi>beneplaciti;</hi> ſo doth <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and this diſtinction of <hi>voluntas occulta</hi> and <hi>revelata,</hi> is uſually reduced to that of <hi>voluntas ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> and <hi>beneplaciti;</hi> But <hi>voluntas ſigni,</hi> and <hi>voluntas revelata,</hi> is more congruouſly applied to the things which God commands, then to the things which God himſelfe work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; as for example, he commands faith and repentance; and the commandements of God, are uſually called the will of God in Scripture, though improperly; and thus the diſtinction is plain. God commands one thing, but it is not neceſſary, that he ſhould will, that that which he commands ſhall come to paſſe: As for example, God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice <hi>Iſaack,</hi> yet he determined that <hi>Iſaack</hi> ſhould not be ſacrificed, as appeared by the event. In like manner he commanded <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let Iſrael goe, yet withall told <hi>Moſes</hi> he would harden his heart, that he ſhould not let Iſrael goe. But this will of God called <hi>voluntas ſigni</hi> and <hi>Revelata,</hi> cannot ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruouſly be ſaid to paſſe upon mans ſalvation. Yet becauſe God may be ſaid to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſalvation, in as much as he commands faith and repentance, that we may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and in this ſenſe, men are exhorted ſometimes to ſave themſelves; As, <hi>Save your ſelves from this froward generation;</hi> and <hi>Save ſome out of the fire with feare;</hi> and <hi>That thou maiſt both ſave thy ſelfe and them that heare thee;</hi> therefore we are content alſo to admit of this <note place="margin">Acts 2. 40. Jud. 23. 1 Tim. 4. 16.</note> diſtinction, and conſider with what judgement and ſufficiency this Author doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne it.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. By his firſt oppoſition, it appears, that meer ignorance bears him out againſt this diſtinction; For we doe acknowledge, that Gods revealed will, and his words revealing it, are true interpretations of his own mind and meaning; though not of ſuch a meaning as he expects ſhould be faſhioned. For he conceives that Gods will in this caſe, is only of what ſhall be done; which is moſt untrue: Hereby is only ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, what is mans duty to doe, although it may be God will not give him effectuall grace to doe it. As for examples ſake, when God commanded <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let Iſrael goe; hereby was ſignified, that God would have it to be <hi>Pharaohs</hi> duty to let Iſrael goe; though withall he profeſſes to <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he would harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, whereupon he ſhould refuſe to let them goe. So when God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice <hi>Iſaack,</hi> hereby it was ſignified, that it was Gods will to make it <hi>Abrahams</hi> duty to ſacrifice his Sonne, albeit God had determined, that when <hi>Abraham</hi> came to poynt of execution of that which was enjoyned him, he would hold <hi>Abrahams</hi> hand, and content himſelfe with <hi>Abrahams</hi> readineſſe, and good heart to obey God in this.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. As to the ſecond; it is untrue that any ſuch thing followeth as this Author pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth, namely, that two contrary wills ſhall be found in God; For firſt there is no contrariety in the wills here ſhaped by the Author himſelfe; thus, <hi>many ſhall be damned,</hi>
                                 <pb n="115" facs="tcp:56120:65"/>
                                 <hi>and thoſe, many may be ſaved.</hi> As for the word <hi>irrevocable,</hi> wherewith this Author ſtuffes his propoſition, that is no attribute of damnation, or the manner thereof, but rather of Gods decrees; wherein ſtill he proceeds and ſpares not to foame out his own ſhame, deſiring to make Gods decrees of a revocable nature. Secondly, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not the accommodation of the diſtinction aright, which is not directly to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and immediatly, but rather to <hi>praecepta, conſilia, remedia,</hi> (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> expreſſeth it) of <hi>voluntas ſigni,</hi> which is all one in this caſe with <hi>voluntas revelata.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="1">1.

But as for the caſe we treat of, if theſe wills were found to be contrary, one of them ſhould deſtroy the other, and the other ſhould have no being at all; and in caſe it hath no being, ſhall it be ſaid to be bad?

                              <p n="2">2.

And is not this a proper doctrine, that God will not have any Reprobate to periſh, both for the overthrowing of Gods omnipotency; for is it not a cleare caſe and undeniable, that all Reprobates doe periſh? As alſo for the overthrowing of Gods immutability; for can it be denied, that when God damnes them, he will have them to periſh? Which if before he would not, can it be avoided, but that Gods will muſt be changed? And laſtly, for the bringing in of manifeſt contrariety into the will of God; ſeeing they dare not deny that God did from everlaſting ordaine every reprobate unto damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I ſay they dare not deny this in plain termes, though their carriage is ſuch, as if their meaning were, that Gods will in decreeing their damnation is conditionall <hi>quoad actum volentis,</hi> as touching the very act of willing, whence it followeth that God ſhall not will their damnation untill their death in infidelity and impenitency; for it is fit the condition ſhould exiſt before the thing conditionated, whoſe exiſtence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends thereupon.

In all theſe and many other places it is cleare (for ought I can ſee) that God forſakes no man, conſidered ſimply in the fall, till by actuall ſinnes and continuance in them he forſakes God. Now if God reject no man from Salvation in time or in act and deed, till he rejects God, then ſurely he rejected no man in purpoſe and decree, but ſuch a one as he foreſaw, would reject and caſt off him. For Gods acts in time, are regulated by his decrees before time. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 11. God worketh all things (ſaith the Apoſtle) according to the counſell of his own will; and therefore there muſt be an exact conformity between them, as between <hi>regulam</hi> and <hi>regulatum,</hi> the rule and the thing meaſured by the rule. By whatſoever therefore God doth in the World, we may know what he purpoſed to doe before the World; and by his actuall caſting men off, when they grow rebellious and impenitent, and not before, we may certainly gather, that he decreed to caſt them off, for their foreſeen rebellion and impenitency, and not before. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it is all one in ſubſtance, to caſt a man off indeed, and to entertain a reſolution to doe it; our <hi>velle</hi> and <hi>facere</hi> are all one in Gods account, and the reaſon is, becauſe where there is a deliberate and ſetled will, the deed will follow, if nothing hinder; much more is Gods will and deed all one, ſeeing his will is omnipotent, and irreſiſtible, and whatſoever he wills directly and abſolutely, is certainly done when the time comes.</p>

                              <p>To the two firſt, I ſay; God is firſt ſought of us before we find him, as touching the obtaining of many bleſſings at the hands of God according to that, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. 37. <hi>I will yet be ſought of the houſe of Iſrael, to performe it unto them.</hi> But as touching the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an heart to ſeek him, thus God is found of us before we ſeek him; according to that, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 65. 1. <hi>I have been found of them that ſought me not:</hi> witneſſe <hi>Saul</hi> marching with a commiſſion from the Prieſts to Damaſcus, to bind all that called on the name of Jeſus.</p>
                              <p>To the third I anſwer, by diſtinguiſhing acceptation, as we diſtinguiſh love; Love is either <hi>complacentiae</hi> or <hi>beneficentiae;</hi> ſo acceptation is either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to reward, or unto complacency; Rewards alwaies follow our doing well; but grace of doing well is alwaies a fruit of Gods favour towards us in Chriſt.</p>
                              <p>To the laſt <hi>the juſt ſhall live by faith;</hi> But there is a grace of God preventing faith; <hi>cur ille credat, ille non credat,</hi> what is the reaſon but the meere pleaſure of God giving the grace of Faith to one, and denying it to another, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth. They that withdraw themſelves my ſoule ſhall have no pleaſure in them;</hi> The meaning is, they ſhall feele the ſmart of his diſpleaſure; but before they withdrew themſelves God took not that pleaſure in them, as to give them his cuſtodient grace, to keep them from withdrawing themſelves; which grace, and that out of his good pleaſure he afforded unto others: But this grace comes in no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count throughout with this Author, like unto the Remonſtrants, who would have no other notice taken of any other counſell of God, then that whereby he decreeth to ſave believers and damne unbelievers. But if you call them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of Gods decree, to beſtow the grace of Faith and repentance upon ſome, and not on others; as whether it proceeds abſolutely or conditionally, they uſually lend a deafe eare to this; whereby it is as cleare as the Sunne, what eſtimation they make of the grace of regeneration, of the grace of Faith, and of repentance; and after what manner they give God the glory of it. By the way obſerve I pray, how he makes the ſtate of man in being a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate conſequent to his withdrawing himſelfe, which undoubtedly is a Temporall act, and accordingly the act of Reprobation, whereby a man is denominated a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, to be meerely Temporall; and conſequently ſuch an act muſt election be alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> not eternall but Temporall.</p>
                              <p>Still he keepeth himſelfe in his ſtrength of confuſion, as moſt advantageous for him; as in ſaying, <hi>God forſakes no man, till by actuall ſinnes and continuance in them he forſaketh God.</hi> But albeit God forſaketh no man, as touching the inflicting of puniſhment, untill man commits actuall ſinne, and continueth therein impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitently; yet before this God did forſake him, as touching the denyall of this grace cuſtodient from ſinne; and the denyall of the grace of repentance to riſe out of ſinne, which yet he grants to many; as in ſhewing mercy to whom he will, like as whom he will he hardneth, and ſo accordingly cures in ſome, that naturall infidely and hardneſſe of heart wherein we are all borne, and leaves it uncured in others. Now conſider we his argument following, which is this. <hi>If God reject no man from ſalvation in time, or in act and deed till he reject God, then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he rejected no man in purpoſe and decree, but ſuch a one as he foreſaw would reject and caſt off God.</hi> Now this argument not one of our Divines deny, not only as it is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reprobation; but neither doe we deny it, applied unto election. For we willingly profeſſe, that like as God beſtowes ſalvation on none, but ſuch as he then findes believers, penitent, and given to good works: in like ſort wee all profeſſe, that God decrees to beſtow ſalvation on none but ſuch as he foreſeeth will believe, repent, and become ſtudious of good works. Like enough, many doe wilfully diſſemble the true ſtate of the Queſtion between us: others ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtake it. The queſtion is not whether God decrees to beſtow ſalvation on ſuch as he foreſeeth will believe, and reject thoſe from ſalvation whom he foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth will not believe; but of the order of reaſon between theſe decrees of God, and the foreſight of obedience the one ſide, and diſobedience on the other; that is, whether like as faith, repentance, and good works in men of ripe years
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56120:67"/>
doe precede their ſalvation, as diſpoſing cauſes thereunto; ſo the fore-ſight of faith, repentance, and good works, precede election, as diſpoſing cauſes or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſites thereunto. In like manner on the other ſide, whether, as finall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in ſinne precedes damnation, as the meritorious cauſe thereof; So fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall perſeverance in ſinne as foreſeen by God precedes reprobation as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Damnation, as the meritorious cauſe thereof: So that the argument here mentioned (which is all his ſtrength in this place) rightly applyed muſt runne thus. Faith, repentance, and good works actually exiſtent precede ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the diſpoſing cauſes thereunto; therefore faith, repentance, and good works foreſeen precede election, as the diſpoſing cauſes thereunto; and what is this, but as good as in expreſſe termes to profeſſe, that election is of faith, repentance, and good works: though it be in direct contradiction unto Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> profeſſing <hi>in terminis</hi> (to ſpeak in this Divines language) that <hi>the purpoſe of God according to election is not of works.</hi> So on the other ſide, Finall perſeverance in ſinne precedes damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the meritorious cauſe thereof; therefore finall perſeverance in ſinne fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, precedes the decree of damnation, as the meritorious cauſe thereof. And then what is to make reprobation to be of evill works, if this be not? Whereas Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> look by what arguments he proves that election is not of good works, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe before <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were borne, or had done good or evill, it was ſaid of them the Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger: by the ſame argument it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually evident that Reprobation is not of evill works. Yet we acknowledge an exact conformity between Gods decrees and the execution thereof: becauſe like as God damnes no man but for ſinne, ſo he decreed to damne no man but for ſinne: where ſinne is in each place made the meritorious cauſe of damnation, not of the decree of damnation. And like as God beſtowes ſalvation on no man of ripe years, but by way of reward of faith, repentance, and good works, ſo he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to beſtow ſalvation on no man of ripe years, but by way of reward of faith, repentance, and good works; where faith repentance and good works, are in each place made the diſpoſing cauſes to ſalvation, but not to election. There was never any ſo madde (ſaith <hi>Aquinas)</hi> as to ſay that merits are the cauſe of predeſtination, as touching the act of God predeſtinating, and Why? but becauſe ſo is the cauſe of predeſtination to be enquired into, as the cauſe of Gods will is enquired into: but formerly he had ſhewed that there can be no cauſe of Gods will, as touching the act of God willing: Now let every one judge whether the act of reprobation, be not as clearly the act of Gods will, as the act of predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and conſequently whether it be not equally as mad a courſe (in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> his judgement) to deviſe a cauſe of reprobation, as to deviſe a cauſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination on the part of Gods will. And no marvail, for the act of Gods will is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, all the works of the creature are temporall: Then, the act of Gods will is God himſelfe, for there is no accident in God; and therefore they may as well ſet themſelves to deviſe a cauſe of God, as a cauſe of Gods will. His phraſe of caſting off, is ambiguous; if it ſignifieth the denyall of ſalvation, it followeth diſobedience; if it ſignifieth the deniall of grace, it precedes diſobedience, in what kind ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. Our <hi>velle</hi> and <hi>facere</hi> are both temporall; in God it is otherwiſe; for his deeds are temporall, and may admit the works of men precedaneous thereunto; but his reſolutions are his decrees, and they are all eternall, and can admit no work of man precedaneous thereunto; yet is God as juſt in the one as in the other. For like as he damnes no man but for ſinne, ſo he never decreed to damne any man but for ſinne; But as touching the grace of regeneration, the grace of faith and repentance, in the granting and denying of this, the Apoſtle plainly tells us, he proceeds meerly according to the good pleaſure of his will; as when he ſaith, <hi>The Lord hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth:</hi> And here alſo God is as juſt in his decrees as in his executions. For if it be juſt with him, to give this grace to whom he will, and deny it to whom he will; it is as juſt with him, to decree the giving of it to whom he will, and the denying of it alſo to whom he will. And why ſhall not the Lord take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to cure infidelity and hardneſſe of heart in whom he will, as he cured it in <hi>Manaſſes</hi> and <hi>Saul;</hi> and leave it uncured in whom he will, as he left it uncured in many a proud Phariſee, and proud Philoſopher,

notwithſtanding all their Morality they boaſted of? Very ſeaſonably he confeſſeth Gods will to be omnipotent and irrefiſtible, when nevertheleſſe, he makes him to will the ſalvation of all Reprobates, though not one of them is ſaved. But by that which followes, by will omnipotent and irrefiſtible, it ſeems he underſtandeth only will abſolute, which he diſtinguiſheth from will conditionate, which can be no other (I ſuppoſe) then this, my will is that all and every one ſhall be ſaved, in caſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent. Now ſeeing it is as true, that 'tis Gods will that they ſhall be damned, in caſe they believe not and repent not, let every ſober man judge, whether this deſerve to be accounted, a will of ſaving rather then a will of damning; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in caſe all men naturally, are farre more prone to infidelity and impenitency, then to faith and repentance. As for a will conditionate in God, like enough this Author carryeth it hand over head without diſtinction, as he doth many other things beſides: whereas no ſuch will is agreeable to the divine nature, <hi>quoad actum volentis,</hi> as touching the act of willing, as both <hi>Bradwardine</hi> by clear reaſon, and <hi>Piſcator</hi> out of the word of God have demonſtrated, but only <hi>quoad res volitas,</hi> as touching the things wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by him.</p>

I have ſhewed the poverty of his performances, by the particular examination of every place alleadged by him, and made it plain, how he betraies his own naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of interpretation of Scripture, and of argumentation throughout; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, the vanity of this his boaſt, that our doctrine of abſolute reprobation, doth contradict theſe plain Scriptures. But he like a brave fellow well conceited of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, and having thereby gotten ſome authority to himſelfe, is bold to give his word, that <hi>it contradicts alſo the whole courſe of Scripture;</hi> which I verily believe he is as well able to performe, as he hath performed the former; and very judiciouſly takes upon him to diſtinguiſh between the whole courſe of Scriptures, and a few pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces pickt up here and there, as if they were no part of the whole courſe of Scripture: Belike by reaſon of their obſcurity, as he pretends, no matter if they were expunged; like as owles are offended with day-light. Our Saviour tells us of ſome that loved darkneſſe rather then light, becauſe their deeds were evill. None hate the light of Gods truth, more then ſuch as are poſſeſſed with errours, as with familiar ſpirits, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when they have been found to play the Apoſtates from Gods truth.

As for interpreting any place, we doe not abridge his liberty in interpreting it after what manner he thinks good, but we are ready to weigh it, and if we find it too light, to eſteem of it as it deſerves: neither doe we refuſe to take into conſideration, what he or any of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices are pleaſed to inſiſt upon.</p>

                           <p>SEcondly it fights with ſome principall Attributes of God, therefore it cannot be true. For God uſeth not to make decrees contrary to his own glorious nature, and incompatible with thoſe excellent Attributes, by which he hath diſcovered part of himſelfe to men.</p>
                           <p>Two things are here to be premiſed.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That Gods chief Attributes are thoſe perfections, in the manifeſtation of which by acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to them, God is moſt glorified, which are Mercy, Juſtice, Truth, &amp;c. For God is more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the exerciſe of theſe amongſt men, then by the putting forth of his unlimited power and Soveraignty; as a King is more renowned among his Subjects, for his clemency, equity, candid and faire dealing, then for his Dominion and Authority, or any thing that is done only for the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation thereof. And there is good reaſon for it. For,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Power is no vertue, but mercy, juſtice, and truth are; acts of power are not Morally good of themſelves, but are made good or evill by their concomitants: if they be accompanied with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, mercy, &amp;c. they are good, if otherwiſe, they are naught. For <hi>juſtum oportet eſſe quod laudem meretur.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. Power and Soveraignty may as well be ſhewed in barbarous and unjuſt actions, as in their contraries. <hi>Saul</hi> ſhewed his authority and power to the full, in ſlaying the Lords Prieſts, and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> in caſting the three Children into the fiery furnace, and <hi>Daniell</hi> into the Lyons Denne; but no mercy, nor juſtice, nor any thing elſe that was good.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing that is to be preconſidered is, that juſtice, mercy, and truth in God, are the ſame in nature with thoſe vertues in men, though infinitely different in degree (as light in the aire, is the ſame with light in the Sunne in nature, not in degrees) and that which is juſt, mercifull, and upright in men, is ſo in God too. And by theſe vertues in our ſelves, and ſuch acts as are conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, <hi>tanquam ex pede Herculem,</hi> we may ſafely meaſure the ſame in God: For otherwiſe theſe things would follow.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The common and received diſtinction of Divine Attributes, into communicable and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable, would fall to the ground: for againſt it this night be ſaid, that the mercy, juſtice, truth, and other vertues that are in us, are not Gods perfections in a lower degree communicated to us, but things of a different nature.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Men cannot be truly ſaid, to be made after Gods image, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 27. Nor when they are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, to be renewed after the ſame image, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. And to be made partakers of the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. That Picture cannot be the picture of ſuch a man, which doth not in its parts and lineaments clearly reſemble him; nor can we be truly the image of God, in reſpect of our graces, if in theſe graces there be not a reſemblance of Gods Attributes.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. We may not ſafely imitate God, as we are commanded; <hi>Be you perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect, Math.</hi> 5. 48. and <hi>be ye holy as I am holy.</hi> Nor when we ſhew forth mercy, juſtice, and truth in our actions, can we be properly ſaid to imitate God, if theſe be one thing in God, and in men another.</p>
                           <p>Theſe two things being thus premiſed, <hi>viz.</hi> that Gods mercy, juſtice, and truth, are three of his chief Attributes, in the exerciſe of which he takes himſelfe to be much glorified, and that we are to meaſure theſe Attributes by the ſame vertues in ourſelves. I come to the proofe of my ſecond reaſon againſt abſolute reprobation, which is, that it oppoſeth ſome of Gods principall Attributes, particularly his juſtice, mercy, and truth.</p>

                              <p>I Cannot but wonder at the performances of the true Author of this Diſcourſe, in comparing that which goes before, with that which comes after; His poverty of argumentation out of Scripture, and the exuberancy of his diſcourſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Before he was in ſome ſtraits, but now he ſeems to have gotten Sea roome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: yet this is my comfort, I ſeem to perceive out of what chimney all this ſmoak proceeds, and to be as well acquainted with the ſpirit that breatheth here, as if I were at his elbow while he penned it. <hi>Agnoſco veteris veſtigia flammae:</hi> ſuch like are Doctor <hi>Jackſons</hi> diſcourſes; and him I have known of old, and his Epheſtion alſo; I profeſſe willingly of Scholar acquaintance, they were my greateſt and deareſt; But ſeeing it hath pleaſed God to put ſuch a difference between us; I would have both them and the World know, I doe as little regard them as feare them.</p>
                              <p>Arminius himſelfe is never more plauſible, then in ſuch like extravagant diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as a poſitive Theologue: But theſe inſpirations were never derived from him; they are flowers of another garden. Theſe have been ſhapen in a more Philoſophicall brain whereof ſome having gotten the reputation, give Oracles therehence, firſt to forme interpretations of Scriptures, in congruity to theſe Theorems, as the true Author bluſheth not to profeſſe; which when he hath perſwaded the World of, I ſee no cauſe to the contrary, but he may adventure a degree farther, and perſwade the burning of the Bible, ſo farre as it concerneth the Doctrine of Predeſtination and Reprobation, Grace and Free-will, and content themſelves with theſe magiſteriall precepts, as moſt ſufficient and ſoveraigne for the endoctrinations of the Chriſtian World in theſe poynts. But he might have ſpared his pains in proving this conſequence, <hi>that if our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Reprobation be contradictory to Gods principall attributes it cannot be true.</hi> I ſay he might have ſpared the proofe hereof, for all that he brings in proofe of this is but darkneſſe in compariſon of the domeſticall light, and ſelfe-evidence, which this conſequence carryeth with it. His premiſes here, and diſcourſe thereof is like unto the Turkes parly before the encounter, when he challenged any one of <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> army to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle combate. For as that parley was meerely complementall, and to no purpoſe, ſave only, as he might conceit, to abate the fervor of his oppoſite, who longed to be dealing with him; ſo this introduction, I find to be of no Scholaſticall uſe in the world, but meerely Politick, to work ſome impreſſion upon the readers affections, where by it may come to paſſe, that when he reads of Gods mercy and juſtice, as here it is ſet forth, he may be the more enclined to judge thereof, according to the genius of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mercy and juſtice. Yet I am content to give my ſelfe to be wrought upon by theſe pretty contemplations, as farre as I ſhall be convicted of any truth and ſobriety in them: though I willingly profeſſe I am very ſuſpicious (for I love to betray my infirmities) that there is little or no truth and ſobriety at all in them.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Now becauſe he hopes to hatch much advantage unto his cauſe out of theſe attributes, and to that purpoſe he ſitts very long upon them, though his market may be never the better for all that. He tells us theſe are Gods chief attributes, and as it appeareth by that which followeth, his practice is to diſparage his power (which I call the Lords Soveraignty) in compariſon to theſe; Now it ſeems they are chiefe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in his opinion, for the furthering of his cauſe; but as for any abſolute chiefty they have in God, I am not as yet acquainted therewith, what I may be by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors performances I know not; yet in the next page ſave one, he profeſſeth expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That all Gods excellencies are infinitely good, and one is not greater then another;</hi> wherein I doe much approve his judgement, as ſavouring of more depth then this, which yet I think not that he, who pretends to be the Author of this diſcourſe, in reſpect of his minority, ſhould be likely to broach; as for other reſpects of principality, I ſhall be ready to take notice of them in due place. But when he ſaith, <hi>God is moſt glorified in the manifeſtation of mercy, juſtice, and truth,</hi> it is a very odde phraſe: For it is one thing to be glorious, another thing to be glorified; dare he deny that God is as glorious in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56120:69"/>
his power and ſoveraignty, as in his mercy, juſtice, and truth? As for the glorifying of him, that depends upon the will of the creature. It may be ſome are more thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto God, for bleſſing them with health, and riches, and honour, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; then for beſtowing his Goſpell upon them; but will it follow herehence, that his goodneſſe in giving riches, &amp;c. is more glorious then his goodneſſe is ſeen in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us his Word and Goſpell? We read that when God laid the foundations of the earth, <hi>the Starres of the morning praiſed God together, and all the children of God rejoyced, Job.</hi> 38. 7. did theſe Angells glorify God for his mercy, juſtice, and truth, in the creating of them? We read ſometimes of Gods power, ſometimes of his wiſdome manifeſted in the Creation, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 11. and 51. 11. and <hi>Pſal:</hi> 136. 5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 12. &amp;c. But no where have I read (that I can remember) he made the World by his mercy, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or truth; and <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. 11. I find the glory of power given unto God in the creation, by the 24 Elders, but neither there, nor any where elſe (that I know) is the glory of his mercy, juſtice, and truth, given unto God therein. <hi>Thou art worthy O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power; for thou haſt created all things, and for thy will ſake, they have bee and are created.</hi> And albeit men faile in giving God the glory of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wiſdome as they ſhould, will it follow herehence, that God is not ſo much to be glorified for his power and wiſdome, as for mercy, juſtice, and truth? yet who falles in this, that failes not in the uſe of the Lords Prayer; the concluſion whereof is this, <hi>For thine is the Kingdome, and power, and glory?</hi> And indeed albeit Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may be ſhewed other waies, then in the way of mercy, juſtice, and truth; yet Gods mercy, juſtice, and truth, cannot be ſhewed without the ſimultaneous demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his power and wiſdome: And therefore when God comes to make good his gracious promiſe, for the delivering of Iſrael out of Egypt: which cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to have been a ſingular work of mercy, juſtice, and truth; the Lord profeſſeth that then he would make himſelfe known unto them by the name, <hi>Jehovah,</hi> by which name he was not known before. The Incarnation of the Sonne of God, was it not an admirable work, as well in the way of power, and wiſdome, as in the way of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, juſtice, and truth? I am apt to confound Gods juſtice with his truth, ere I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, without having that awfull regard to the authority of this writer, as perhaps may ſeem fit: But I hope it is a pardonable fault, conſidering my education hitherto in divinity; whereby I have attained only thus farre, to the acknowledgement of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice Divine; for juſtice conſiſteth, in giving every one his due; now this due being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of God, or the creature: Juſtice Divine in giving God his due, <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath taught me, that it is all one with Gods wiſdome, promoting his ends by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous means; juſtice Divine in giving the creature his due, I have learnt to depend wholy on Gods determination, manifeſted by his promiſes and threatnings, and this is commonly called <hi>juſtitia fidelitatis,</hi> which I take to be all one with truth. But I am very willing to be better informed by this Author, and I give my ſelfe to his contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, to have my thoughts faſhioned by them as they can; and if hitherto they have not transformed me into a new Creed, I cannot help that. Now if it be ſo that Gods power and wiſdome accompany the demonſtration of his mercy, juſtice, and truth, I cannot ſee how God is honoured more by the exerciſe of the one ſort, then of the other, but rather on the contrary. So that albeit a King is more renowned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Subjects, for his clemency, equity, candid and faire dealing, then for his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and authority; yet I doe not eaſily perceive, how God is renowned more for his clemency, equity, &amp;c. then for his power, &amp;c. yet again this ſeems to me a very poore argument; to conclude Clemency to be a chiefe attribute of God, becauſe men doe more magnify him for that, then for his Power. For conſider, a Malefactor going to execution, is called back and ſaved by the Kings pardon, this man (be ſure) will magnify the King more for his clemency in ſaving him, then he would for his juſtice in putting him to death: but will it follow herehence, that Clemency is a more chiefe attribute of a King then juſtice? <hi>Solomon</hi> the greateſt of Kings hath ſaid, the Throne is eſtabliſhed by Juſtice: and it was wont to be ſaid, <hi>fiat juſtitia, ruat orbis.</hi> No ſuch thing is ſaid of Mercy. Then again the King could not doe this but by vertue of his prerogative, yet the Malefactor magnifies him not for his prerogative, but for the favourable uſe of it for his good, for that is all he reſpects: yet aske I pray any man of judgement, which is the chiefer attribute of a King, and more glorious of the two; his prerogative or his clemency? Clemency is a very vulgar vertue, but the royall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative is peculiar to one; A Thiefe after a robbery committed on the high-way,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56120:70"/>
meeting with a begger that beggeth a penny, if he aſtoniſh him with the gift of twelve pence, the begger is very likely more highly to magnify him, then any honeſt man going on the way, that beſtowes but an halfe penny upon him; yet, Whoſe liberality is the greater of the two? Carnall men renowne others for the benefit they receive by them; not according to their true worth: yet there is a farther difference; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authority may be abuſed, and Soveraignty on earth is not alwaies joyned with good Morality, much leſſe with Piety; but in caſe a man could not ſinne, the more honour and authority is laid upon him, the more glorious ſhould he be; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backt with the greater power to execute his goodneſſe. Thus it is with God, it is impoſſible he ſhould abuſe his ſoveraignty; yea his mercy and juſtice are one and the ſame reality with his power: what a vanity then is it to diſcourſe as this Author doth, in preferring one attribute of God before another, as if God were more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the one then in the other. But he hath farther reaſons for this, let us conſider them: 1. <hi>Power</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is no vertue, nor morally good, but mercy juſtice and truth are.</hi> I anſwer: Though it be ſo, yet who will ſay, the glory of vertue is greater then the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of power?</p>
                              <p n="2">2. Eſpecially conſidering, that vertue is common to the meaneſt.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. A little vertue joyned with power, ſhall bring forth farre better fruits, then a great deale of vertue without power.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. Though it be ſo in man, whoſe power may be abuſed, ſhall we transferre it to God, whoſe power cannot be abuſed, his power and his goodneſſe being all one?</p>
                              <p n="5">5. Morall vertues denote a goodneſſe removeable where it is, obtainable where it is not; but no ſuch goodneſſe can be found in God, and conſequently no Morall vertue in proper ſpeech, whatſoever is in him, that being naturall and eſſentiall unto him.</p>
                              <p n="6">6. Laſtly, to power only and ſoveraignty we owe obedience, and not to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and juriſdiction is farre more glorious then ſubjection. Yet by the way it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true (in my judgement) that <hi>acts of Power are made good by being accompanied with juſtice,</hi> ſpeaking of Morall goodneſſe; as acts of vertue alone they are morally good, not as acts of power. If <hi>justum oportet eſſe quod laudem meretur;</hi> then juſtice if not alone, yet chiefly, ſhall be that whereby one is renowned: yet herehence it followes, that every act of Gods power ſhall <hi>laudem mereri;</hi> becauſe it is impoſſible that any thing he doth ſhould be otherwiſe then juſt, ſuch a <hi>juſtitia condecentiae</hi> followeth all his actions; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we muſt grant, that God hath power to doe that which is unjuſt.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. And accordingly, though power humane and Angelicall, may be ſhewed in barbarous actions: yet power Divine cannot; let him doe whatſoever he is able, it ſhall not be unjuſt; let God turne all the World into nothing, another manner of deſtruction then that of <hi>Sauls</hi> ſlaying the Lords Prieſts, or <hi>Netuchadnezzars</hi> caſting the three Children into the fiery Furnace, yet dares this Author ſay, that God herein ſhould be unjuſt.</p>
                              <p>I come to the ſecond of his premiſes.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. We have had a taſt of this Authors faculty in roaving at large, and within the Horizon of his own braine, we ſhall drink a deeper draught of it ere we part. And once again I willingly profeſſe, it cannot enter into my beliefe, that theſe conceits have dropt from the fancy of a young Divine; ſome old beaten Naturaliſt rather doth imploy his braine to doe the Arminians this ſervice. I never found hitherto that Arminius, or any of his Batavian followers have thus diſcourſed, <hi>that juſtice, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and truth in God, are the ſame in nature, with thoſe vertues in men, though infinitely differing in degree.</hi> I conceive Arminius (though wild enough in his 20 reaſons, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his reaſons drawn from the conſideration of Gods juſtice) to be more Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe, and farre more Scholaſticall then ſo; though I nothing doubt, we have a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration amongſt us that affect to have all learning in Divinity, to goe by their rules of Philoſophy, and yet the baſeſt Philoſophy I think that ever was deviſed. And this Author whoſoever he be, ſeems herein to diſcourſe after ſuch a manner, as if he were of the number of thoſe that heard the Devill read Lectures through a grate in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity of <hi>Toledo. If juſtice mercy and truth in God, are the ſame in nature, with thoſe vertues that are in men,</hi> then there is ſomething in man, that is the very eſſence of God; For undoubtedly whatſoever is in God, is of his eſſence; yet thoſe are they that attribute Manicheiſme unto us. And ſeeing the vertues of man are accidents, it followes that that, which under the ſame name is attributed to God, is either an accident in God;

or if it be his eſſence, then the eſſence of God, is of the ſame nature with accidents in man.</p>
                              <p>Thirdly; hence it followes, that the Divine perfections conſiſt of degrees, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently muſt needs be accidentall unto him, not ſubſtantiall; for ſubſtance ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no degrees.</p>
                              <p>Fourthly; if juſtice humane be of the ſame nature with juſtice Divine, it followeth, not only that, that which is juſt in man is juſt with God, but that it muſt be after the ſame manner juſt; that like as mens juſtice conſiſteth in obedience to Gods law, implying ſubjection thereunto: So juſtice Divine muſt conſiſt in obedience to Gods law implying ſubjection. And like as man is obliged to be juſt, in the ſame manner God is obliged to be juſt. And conſequently like as <hi>Soul</hi> ſinned and became unjuſt in ſlaying the Lords Prieſts, ſo had God been unjuſt in doing the like.</p>
                              <p>Fiftly; man ſinneth in ſuffering his brother to ſinne, when it lies in his power to keepe him from ſinne; and conſequently, if that which is unjuſt with man is unjuſt with God, God ſinneth as often as he ſuffereth any ſinne to be committed in the world, for undoubtedly he could prevent it. <hi>Auguſt. contra Julian.

                              <p n="1">1. The firſt is drawn from the received diſtinction of divine Attributes, namely into ſuch as are communicable unto the creature, and ſuch as are incommunicable; but here he conceales his Authority. But let him bring forth the teſtimony of any Divine, that maintains any Attribute Divine to be the ſame <hi>quoad nomen &amp; nominis rationem,</hi> with any Attribute humane. Yet we may talke of Gods Attributes ſo, as for diſtinction ſake to ſay, ſome are ſuch as are alſo Attributed to man, others are not; without maintaining, that humane vertues are of the ſame nature with Attribute Divine. Life is a Divine Attribute, it is alſo attributed to man, to a beaſt, to a plant; But will any wiſe man ſay that the life of God is of the ſame nature with the life of a Man, of a Beaſt, of a Plant? What more equivocall then the word <hi>Canis?</hi> Attributed to a Starre, to a Fiſh, to a Foure-footed creature on the Earth; I anſwer much more equivocall is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing in common attributed to God and Man; For whatſoever is in God, is his Eſſence, but between the Eſſence of God, and the eſſence of Man, there is a vaſter difference, then between the eſſence of a Starre, of a Fiſh, of a Dogge; how much more difference is there between the Eſſence of God, and an accident in man, ſuch as his vertues are. In a word, the vertue of Man is of an annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, and if it be of the ſame nature with ſomething in the nature of God, why ſhould not ſomething in the nature of God be of an annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition? I marvaile not if men of this generation are apt to profeſſe that they will turne Atheiſts rather then concurre in ſome poynts with the Contra-Remonſtrants; for their diſcourſes breath Atheiſme in a very high degree. It is a queſtion among Schoolemen, whether <hi>Ens</hi> (the moſt abſtract notion of all other) be predicated univocally of God and the creature; the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans utterly deny it; <hi>Scotus</hi> maintains the contrary with ſome curioſity of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation: but his Arguments are anſwered by the Dominicans and particularly by <hi>Verſor</hi> on the Metaphyſicks; but never, I think, was it heard of <hi>Scotus</hi> or any other (till now) that the vertues of man are of the ſame nature with the Divine Attributes, differing only in degree.</p>
                              <p>I come to his ſecond Argument.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. It was wont to be accounted that man was the image of God, not in reſpect of the qualities of his mind and will only, but even in reſpect of his Eſſence alſo; And ſome have been anciently condemned for denying this: why then doe we not ſay that the Eſſence of man is of the ſame nature with the Eſſence of God differing only in degree. In the next place the power of underſtanding and liberty of will in man a bodily creature, brings him neareſt to God, of all bodily creatures: it was wont to be ſaid that all other creatures had <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigia Dei,</hi> but man was <hi>imago Dei;</hi> as in whom is repreſented the Divine Nature as intelligent and free; ſo farre forth, as a compound creature of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56120:71"/>
body and ſoule can repreſent him; but who hath ever ſaid that the underſtanding of God was of the ſame nature with the underſtanding of man: and the will of God of the ſame nature with the will of man? It is well known that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and will humane, are but naturall faculties in man; but the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and will Divine, is the very eſſence of God; and if mans eſſence be not of the ſame nature with his faculties, doth it become us to profeſſe that the eſſence of God is of the ſame nature with the naturall faculties of man? As for the graces of Gods ſpirit, what are theſe but the three Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall vertues; all other are but Morall vertues ſanctified by theſe; Now ſhew me what Faith there is in God of the ſame nature with our Faith dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering only in degree? What hope there is in God of the ſame nature with our hope, differing only in degree, what charity there is in God of the ſame nature with our Charity, differing only in degree. Theſe indeed being of all other the moſt peculiar fruits of regeneration, whereby we are renewed after the image of God, as touching the adventitious qualification of our natures, ſhould have Attributes divine anſwerable unto them (if any) of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with them, differing only in degree. Yet herein (as I conceive) conſiſts not ſo much our participation of the Divine Nature, as in that, the Spirit of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and God the Sonne is communicated unto us, given unto us to be the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate fountain of all actions and motions ſpirituall in us.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. And albeit theſe Attributes, which in common doe denominate God and man, are one thing in God, and in man another: yet this nothing derogates from our imitation of God; and ſtriving to be perfect and holy in our kind as creatures; like as God is perfect and holy in his kind as Creator. And that I may repreſent ſome authority for my diſcourſe, whereas this Author repreſents none for his, it is a poynt generally received in the Schooles, that in this weakneſſe of our underſtanding, we come to know what God is by negation rather then by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. <hi>Capreolus</hi> upon the firſt of the Sentences <hi>Diſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. rehearſeth diverſe paſſages out of <hi>Aquinas</hi> to this purpoſe, as out of 1. <hi>Contra Gentes</hi> cap. 14.</p>

Is his mercy abundant, doth it extend it ſelfe farther then juſtice, when it is tackt up ſo ſhort, limited to a few choſen ones, when 100 for one at leaſt, (take in all parts of the World) are unavoidably caſt away, out of his only will and pleaſure? Or doth his love paſſe knowledge, when we ſee daily greater love then this in men and other creatures? What Father and Mother (that have not only caſt off Fatherhood and Motherhood, but humanity too) (ſo the Authors Copy hath it) would determine their children to certain death, or to cruell torments worſe then death, for one only offence, and that committed too, not by them in their own perſons, but by ſome other, and only imputed unto them?

                           <p n="2">2. In their inevitable deſtination to deſtruction, under a ſhew of the contrary. The Devills, as they are decreed to damnation, ſo they know it, they expect it, they look for no other: but men, even thoſe that are appoynted unto wrath, are yet fed up with hopes of Salvation, and made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the whole buſineſſe is put into their hands; ſo as that if they doe periſh, it is not <hi>[defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu miſericordiae]</hi> becauſe God hath no mercy on them, but <hi>[defeclu voluntatis propriae,]</hi> becauſe they will not be ſaved, when yet there is no ſuch mercy. Now if it be worſe to be deluded in miſery, then ſimply to be miſerable, then the condition of men in this reſpect, is made by this decree to be worſe then the ſtate of Devills.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. In their obligation to believe, and the aggravation of their puniſhment by not believing. The Devills, becauſe they muſt be damned, are not commanded to believe in Chriſt, nor is their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment encreaſed by not believing: but poore men, who (by this decree) can ſcape Hell no more then the Devills, muſt yet be tied to believe in Chriſt, and muſt have their torments encreaſed if they believe not. Theſe things being ſo (I think) I may conclude that this decree of abſolute reprobation overthrowes the mercy of God in generall, and toward mankind.</p>
                           <p>Nor doth that quiet my mind, which is uſually anſwered to theſe objections; <hi>viz.</hi> That God by this decree, doth fully manifeſt his juſtice and his mercy too; his juſtice towards the Reprobates, and his mercy toward the choſen veſſells: and that it is neceſſary that his decrees ſhall be ſo ordered, as that both theſe may be clearly manifeſted by them.

And after ſo much froth of words ſpent to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe unleſſe to beguile his reader, and dull him with verboſity, that he might not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and obſerve how accurately he performes in the iſſue, that which he intends. Conſider (I beſeech you) what a meager and ſtarveling reply he puts to this. <hi>Gods mercy</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is revealed to be rich mercy, abundant, long ſuffering, beyond apppehenſion;</hi> we grant all this, and adde that it is glorious alſo; and makes the partakers of it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, <hi>with joy unſpeakable and glorious;</hi> but this belongs only to them that believe, and to certain who are called <hi>veſſells of mercy,</hi> in diſtinction from <hi>veſſells of wrath, Rom.</hi> 9. 22, 23. which <hi>veſſells of mercy,</hi> in diſtinction from <hi>veſſells of wrath,</hi> muſt needs be the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect only, in diſtinction from Reprobates: with what face can he deny, that ſuch a mercy is manifeſted on the Elect by our Doctrine?</p>
                              <p n="2">2. I farther adde that ſuch a mercy is not manifeſted by his Doctrine as by ours, for the glory of Gods mercy conſiſts in this, that it is of free grace pardoning our ſinnes, regenerating us, changing our hearts, giving faith and repentance to ſome,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56120:73"/>
when he denies it to others; all this I ſay is of meere grace, by our Doctrine without reſpect to any preparation or qualification in man; according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth:</hi> this is not their Doctrine, if it were, I ſee no cauſe of any materiall difference between us.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. And I find it ſtrange, that men ſhould grow to ſuch a degree of immodeſty, as to affect ſingularity, and to ſhew a dexterity, in ſuch ſort to advance Gods mercy, as to obſcure and deface his grace, as this Author doth; for all along you ſhall not find him to magnify Gods free grace: whereas Mercy ſhewed to one rather then to another, in reſpect of his being better diſpoſed for the receiving of it more then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is rather of the nature of juſtice, then of Mercy diſtinct from juſtice.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. And to this purpoſe he takes no pains to ſet down, wherein this mercy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, which he ſo much amplifies, but carryeth it throughout in hugger mugger, and in the clouds of generality, that it might appeare the more likely, to be indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extended to all; and albeit ſometimes he expreſſeth it, to be the love of a Father towards his children, yet it is too too probable, that he extends this to all and every one, as the children of God by creation; And therefore particulates not wherein it conſiſts, as namely whether in mercy temporall or ſpirituall; and as touching mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſpirituall, whether this be not the pardoning of mens ſinnes, together with the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination of the mind, ſanctification of the will, change of the heart, and giving of faith, repentance, obedience, and finall perſeverance therein. For had he particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe, he had apparently marred his own market, and been driven to looſe that in retaile, which he hoped to gaine in groſſe; For theſe mercies are not extended to all. But their meaning is, God offers theſe to all, and that any faile of them, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe man diſpoſeth not himſelfe for the receiving of them. This is the iſſue of his advancing Gods mercy, utterly to diſparage the freedome of Gods grace. Now of the Divine mercy in this ſenſe, to wit, as freely extended to all, he hath not one word throughout, as I can remember, in ſo vaſt premiſes; all that he ſpeaks of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Gods mercy to variety of objects, is diſpatched in three lines of theſe his three large leaves; as where he ſaith, <hi>his mercy is more largely extended then his juſtice, and that look how much three or foure come ſhort of a thouſand, ſo much doth his juſtice come ſhort of his mercy in the exerciſe of it;</hi> And upon this poore interpretation, he grounds the only ſubſtantiall part of his reply, to our anſwer to this his argument. For to ſay that <hi>Gods mercy is rich, abundant, long ſuffering, beyond apprehenſion,</hi> is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For all this hinders not, but that the application of it may be, and is, made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to certain veſſells, who are called <hi>veſſells of mercy,</hi> in diſtinction from <hi>veſſells of wrath, Rom.</hi> 9. 22. 23. Therefore he addes, <hi>That it ſurmounts his juſtice in its objects and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> wherein what he means by <hi>its expreſſions,</hi> I know not. For I find no compariſon made by him between <hi>Gods mercy and his juſtice in its expreſſions;</hi> but only in reſpect of the objects, and there the expreſſion of juſtice, ſeems more quick then the expreſſion of mercy: And as for the extention of mercy, to more then juſtice is extended to, he diſpatcheth in three lines, as I ſaid, of theſe three leaves of his diſcourſe. But let us ſee what force he finds in that compariſon to ſerve his turne. Firſt he ſaieth the compariſon is between three and foure on the one ſide, and a thouſand on the other, as if the odds were a thouſand to three or foure: but how doth he prove that? The Text compares three or foure generations to thouſands; not to a thouſand generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but to thouſands: and he boldly conceives it to be underſtood of thouſands of generations; though it be much more then the World conſiſts of, from the beginning of the World to the end of it: For ſuppoſe the World ſhall laſt ſeaven or eight thouſand years; how many years will he allow to a generation?

But leave we theſe fooleries, and content our ſelves with the plain Text, and not piece it out with our brainſick additions.

And of the goodneſſe of God towards <hi>Abraham,</hi> in chooſing his ſeed after him, even many thouſands of them, the Jewes had ſenſible experience that very day he ſpake unto them from Mount Sinai; he did not mean to trouble their braines with any <hi>Algebra</hi> in counting up a thouſand generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

                              <p>The vanity of the next, as touching the amplitude of the objects whereto mercy is extended (though this alone is to the preſent purpoſe) I have already ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; it being apparent that in Scripture phraſe, only the Elect are counted <hi>veſſells of mercy,</hi> and all the reſt <hi>veſſells of wrath.</hi>

But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, this appears in Gods dealings with his Angells, who ſinned once, and fell for ever without all hope of recovery. And as for Gods ſparing a man in caſe God gives not repentance, what will be the iſſue, but filling up of the meaſure of their ſinnes? For to ſpeak in <hi>Auſtins</hi> language, <hi>Contra Julian.

                              <p>And firſt, this Author commits a very great Anomaly, in entring upon it with ſuch ſtate, as proves nothing anſwerable to his own profeſſion anon after, almoſt in the ſame breath. Marke the ſtate (I pray) of his entrance hereupon, thus: <hi>And as if theſe compariſons were too ſmall too expreſſe Gods affection to his creatures, he proceeds farther:</hi> now the compariſons preceding were taken from reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as namely from Fatherly and Motherly affections (amongſt men) towards their children; and <hi>theſe compariſons he ſignifies to have been to ſmall, to expreſſe Gods af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to his creatures:</hi> and that therefore the Lord proceeds farther, and compares himſelfe to a <hi>Hen,</hi> which he ſaith is one of the moſt affectionate females among un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable creatures; not daring to ſay, tis more affectionate then creatures reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yet moſt improvidently carried away with affectation of a Rhetoricall flouriſh, he faignes a gradation from creatures leſſe affectionate, to creatures more affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and preſently himſelfe beats out the braines of his invention, (before he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware) as ſoon as it is borne.</p>
                              <p>As for <hi>Auſtins</hi> amplification of the affectionate nature of an Hen above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures; we may conſider that <hi>Auſtins</hi> Tractates on <hi>John,</hi> are of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sermons, and therein the ancients doe accommodate themſelves to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular amplifications. It is true we doe not know <hi>Sparrowes, Swallowes, Storkes, Doves, to be Mothers, but when we ſee them in their neſts;</hi> but what is the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereof? Is it not becauſe their young ones are wild, and as ſoon as they are apt to fly, one flies one way, and another flies another way, they come together no more; it is not ſo with chickens which are tame creatures, and we ſee the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Hen towards them, we doe not ſee the carriage of other fowles towards their young ones.</p>
                              <p>Yet we read not the like of a Hen, as of a Storke, that when her neſt was on fire, out of a deſire to ſave them with her wings from the fire, hath not forſaken her young ones till ſhee was burnt her ſelfe; And we have ſeen alſo how a Hen hath ſometimes peckt her young ones, and driven them from her, when they would have rooſted under her.</p>
                              <p>And in my judgement our Saviour doth not repreſent his tender affection to the Jewes, by the generall affection of an Hen to hers, but to that particular carriage of hers in deſiring to gather her chickens under her wings. <note n="*" place="margin">The Doctor here alludes unto a known ſong.</note> Neither doe I think that he who invited thoſe mighty men, but unto what? unto a Hen, was to expreſſe his ſingularity of affection towards them: be it that God is more mercifull to man then to all other creatures; whence I pray proceeds this? is it not meerly from the good pleaſure of his own will? and if ſo, why may he not, out of the meere pleaſure of his own will reſtraine his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mercy to ſome few, who are accordingly called in Scripture expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>veſſells of mercy;</hi> diſtinguiſhed from all the reſt who are called <hi>veſſells of wrath.</hi>

Whereas he ſaith, that <hi>with ſuch a mercy cannot ſtand ſuch a Decree, as abſolute repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</hi> We anſwer; neither doe we ſay any ſuch decree doth ſtand with ſuch a mercy; it is rather abſolute election ſtands with ſuch a mercy, then any reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Scripture plainly giving us to underſtand, that they on whom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation paſſeth, are <hi>not veſſells of mercy, but veſſells of wrath.</hi> But like as God though he ſpared not Angells when they fell, nor left any way open unto them for repentance, whereby to returne to his grace and favour, yet he ſpared man, and left a way open unto him, to returne to his grace and favour by faith in Chriſt. In like ſort, though God were pleaſed abſolutely to elect ſome amongſt men, yet this nothing precludes him from dealing as abſolutely in reprobating others, that is, in purpoſing to deny them the ſpirit of faith and repentance, whereby they might riſe after they were fallen; which grace moſt freely and abſolutely he decreed to beſtow, and as freely and abſolutely he doth beſtow on others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. <hi>he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth.</hi> By this I pray judge of the inſipid nature of this diſcourſe, yet ſee the fouleneſſe of his mouth; unleſſe God be indifferent unto all, and make all veſſells of mercy, <hi>he is a Father of Cruelty, and more properly ſo to be called, then a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercies,</hi> and the very name of the Devill (for ſo he takes upon him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret that name in the Revelation <gap reason="foreign">

If many thouſands, even all the Infants of Turkes and Sarazens dying in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall ſinne, are tormented by him in Hell fire, is he to be accounted the father of cruelties for this? And I profeſſe I cannot deviſe a greater ſhew and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of cruelty, then in this. Now I beſeech you conſider the ſpirit that breatheth in this man; dares he cenſure God, as a Father of cruelties for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting eternall death upon them that are guilty of it? Now hath not he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe profeſſed, that all borne in originall ſinne, are borne guilty of eternall death? his words are theſe, Fol. 2. p. 2. <hi>That all mankind is involved in the firſt ſinne, and the fruits thereof, which are corruption of nature, and the guilt of eternall death.</hi> And this he confidently believes. Now I ſhould think, that there is no ſhew of cruelty in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting eternall death on them that are guilty of it: For if God were cruell here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, then alſo he were cruell in damning each one whom he doth damne both Men and Angells. Now I pray, let every ſober reader judge, which is the greater cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of the two, to execute eternall death on him that is guilty of it, or to make him by meere imputation guilty of eternall death, who otherwiſe is not guilty of it? Is not this latter farre greater cruelty then the former? Or indeed the only cruelty; there being no cruelty in the other at all? (like as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, for a Mule to bring forth having conceived, is no ſtrange thing, but for a Mule to conceive that indeed is prodigious.) Now this latter is this Authors doctrine, expreſſely profeſſing in the next page to that where now we are, <hi>that the ſinne of Adam</hi> (the fruit whereof he makes to be the <hi>guilt of eternall death.) is the ſinne of our nature by imputation only:</hi> whence it followeth, that God makes all men guilty of eternall death by imputation only. Now judge I pray which of us makes God the Father of cruelties, he or wee?

the curſe of Gods wrath, to fill up the meaſure of their ſinne, as it is ſaid of the Jewes, <hi>to fulfill their ſinne alway, for the wrath of God is come upon them to the uttermoſt;</hi> yea and to be ſtricken with the ſpirit of giddineſſe alſo; and become like a drunken man, that erreth in his vomit, the iſſue whereof is to defile himſelfe, and thoſe that are neareſt to him.

But if Gods mercy hath his courſe towards his children only, as himſelfe makes the accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if God be ſevere towards thoſe who are none of his, ſhall this any way preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice his mercy towards them? or if he take liberty to account all Gods creatures his children by reaſon of creation, why doth he not extend the mercy of God to Devills alſo, and for ſhame leave off his former diſtinction of <gap reason="foreign">

But whether he will acknowledge it or no, the Apoſtle plainly ſpeaks of veſſells of mercy, in diſtinction from veſſels of wrath, and ſurely the courſe of his wrath on them, doth nothing impaire the free courſe of his mercy toward others. But give we him leave, to breath on: <hi>Is he ſlow to anger, when he hath taken ſuch a ſmall and ſpeedy occaſion to puniſh the greater part of men in Hell torments for ever, and for one ſinne once committed, hath ſhut up the greater part of men under invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible unbeliefe and damnation?</hi> Now, I pray, apply this his devout interrogation unto the Angells that fell, who upon the firſt ſinne committed by them, have ever ſince been ſhut up under invincible hardneſſe of heart, and damnation. Yet what doth this hinder his ſlowneſſe of anger, which is to be underſtood of the execution of his wrath; not of his decree. For all the decrees of God are everlaſting, nor can be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And as for the execution of wrath, the Devills themſelves feele it not yet; <hi>they are reſerved to the judgement of the great day; they believe and tremble;</hi> they cryed out to our Saviour, <hi>art thou come to torment us before our time?</hi> Nay ſuppoſe all were to be damned to eternall death as ſoon as they were borne, what injuſtice were there in this, if ſo be all be found guilty of eternall death, which this Author denies not? Nay farther, he ſaith it is God that hath made them guilty of it by meere imputation: yet as for the corruption of nature, which he makes to be the other fruit of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, I doe not find that he aſcribes that to divine imputation. Now what is the nature of this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, is it invincible unbeliefe or no? if it be, then he diſputes againſt himſelfe, as well as againſt us; if it be not, what unbeliefe doth he call it, or is it no unbeliefe at all? So I demand whether it be invincible hardneſſe of heart or no? if not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at all it is to be called hardneſſe of heart? if notwithſtanding this corruption a man hath power to believe, to obay, power to yeeld to any ſpirituall good whereto he ſhall be excited, why doth he call it naturall corruption? The Apoſtle plainly profeſſeth of them <hi>that are in the fleſh, that they cannot pleaſe God;</hi> that <hi>the naturall man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of God, and that he cannot know them:</hi> of ſome, <hi>that they could not believe:</hi> of others, <hi>that they cannot repent.</hi> But be all this granted, he is never a whit the leſſe ſlow to anger, that is, to puniſh; the Devills themſelves as yet doe rather feare then feele his wrath.</p>
                              <p>Laſtly, touching puniſhing in hell, it is either ſpoken of Infants, or Men of ripe years, if of Infants departing in infancy; if guilty of eternall death, tis no injuſtice to inflict it; and though he be ſlow to anger towards ſome, yet it is not neceſſary he ſhould be ſo to others. The Scriptures witneſſe the contrary, in the flood where In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants periſhed as well as others; and in the deſtruction of Sodome by fire, where none were ſpared ſave <hi>Lot</hi> and his two Daughters. As for men of ripe years, their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not for originall ſinne only, but for actuall ſinnes unrepented of. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells fell irrecoverably upon one actuall ſinne; I know not the like condition of any beſides. And as for the ſmallneſſe of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, which this Author is pleaſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate, by calling it <hi>a ſmall occaſion,</hi> as if he were of his ſpirit that ſaid, If God turned

                                 <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe for eating an Apple, ſhall not I turne thee out of my ſervice for purloyning a fat Capon? Why doth he not charge God rather, for making all men hereupon guilty of eternall death by meere imputation, as himſelfe ſaith; then for inflicting eternall death only on them that are guilty of it, as we ſay? But let we him finiſh the Declamation he hath begunne. <hi>Is his mercy abundant, doth it extend it ſelfe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then juſtice, when it is tackt up ſo ſhort, limited to a very few choſen ones, when a hundred for one at leaſt are unavoidably caſt away, out of his only will and pleaſure.</hi> As touching this I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed, how much he is out in his <hi>Algebra,</hi> but let that paſſe, unleſſe this Divine take upon him to deliver truer Oracles then Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> we are bound to believe, that the elect only are <hi>veſſells of mercy,</hi> diſtinguiſhed from reprobates, as <hi>veſſells of wrath. Rom.</hi> 9. 22, 23. and toward theſe alone it is, that his mercy is abundant, in the way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing ſaving and ſpirituall graces. It is untrue, that he hath proved any ſuch thing as he pretends, namely that Gods mercy is extended to more perſons then his juſtice. And applied aright, namely as touching mercy ſeen in pardoning ſinnes, in changing the heart, and ſaving ſoules, which are peculiar to Gods elect, the moſt brazen faced oppoſite to Gods holy truth that liveth cannot deny, but that they to whom theſe are granted, are farre fewer then they to whom they are denied. And if within the Church only (for there only are found ſuch as feare God) his mercy extends to thouſands of them that feare him, when but to the third and fourth generation he puniſheth the ſinnes of the Father upon the Children, (which is all the proofe this Author brings to this purpoſe) it followeth not herehence, that his mercy extendeth any whit to more then doth his juſtice, conſidering the ſmall proportion of thoſe within the Church, and therein of them that feare him, in compariſon to thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Church. And like as viſiting the ſinne of Fathers, which is commonly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of temporall puniſhments, ſo in proportion the mercy is to be underſtood of temporall mercy. And we well know that it is nothing neceſſary, that a man that fears God, ſhould have children. And like as God doth not alwaies thus viſit the ſinnes of Fathers upon the Children; in like ſort it is not alwaies neceſſary, that God ſhould ſhew mercy to thouſands of every one of them that feare him. He dealt ſo with <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> they to whom the Law was delivered, knew this full well; then again, muſt not they who look to have an intereſt in this gracious promiſe, look unto it, that they walk in the ſteps of their Forefathers that feared God? By all which may appeare, the ſuperficiary nature of this Diſputants argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, even then, when the zeale of his cauſe makes him, as moſt confident, ſo alſo moſt luxuriant. Laſtly, doe we ſay that God damnes any man out of <hi>his only will and pleaſure?</hi> Doe we not profeſſe that he damnes no man but for ſinne? And as he damnes no man but for ſinne, ſo likewiſe that he decreed to damne no man but for ſinne, though there could be no cauſe of this his decree, but of his meere will and pleaſure he made this decree, namely, to damne many thouſands for their ſinnes. But let him come to an end of this his roaving diſcourſe, when he thinks good and not before. <hi>Or doth his love paſſe knowledge, when we ſee daily greater love then this in men, and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. What Father or Mother, would determine their children to certain death, or to cruell torments worſe then death, for one only offence, and that committed too, not by them in their own perſons, but by ſome other, and only imputed unto them? How much leſſe would they give themſelves to beget Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and bring them forth, that they might bring them to the rack, fire, gallowes, and ſuch like tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and deaths;</hi> What doe I heare? Doth man or any creature, ſhew more love to their Children, then God doth towards his Elect? Did they ever provide ſuch a ſacrifice to make ſatisfaction for their Childrens ſinnes, as God did provide for his? Yea but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates alſo are Gods Children, this muſt needs be his meaning, though in plain termes he ſpared to expreſſe ſo much. How unnaturall then was Chriſt, who would not pray for the World if they were all his children? And what meant he to profeſſe, that he ſanctified himſelfe only for them for whom he prayed? Which ſanctification of himſelfe, was in reſpect of the offering up of himſelfe upon the croſſe, as <hi>Maldonate</hi> confeſſeth, was the interpretation of all the Fathers whom he had read. And in that prayer profeſſeth of them ſaying, <hi>they are thine, and thou gavest them unto me,</hi> as much as to ſay; the World was not his. And farther conſider; Is it ſafe to meaſure out Gods proceedings, by the proceedings of men? What Father or Mother would be content to execute a Child of theirs upon the Gallowes, when by ſome capitall crime he hath deſerved it? How much leſſe hold them upon the rack of continuall tortures; what then? muſt not God be allowed to inflict eternall death upon his creatures? And
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56120:77"/>
what hath an earthly Father or Mother to doe, either to determine or execute death on any? This belongs to God not to man, unleſſe he make choyce of them, as of his Miniſters for the execution of vengeance. But this Author is nothing yet awaked out of his dreames, or his Arminian Lethargy. Yet I hope he will grant that God did foreſee all this, even the ſinnes of <hi>Judas</hi> in betraying, and of the Jewes in crucifying the Sonne of God; yet nevertheleſſe, he was content to bring forth both him and them into the World. Now what earthly Father and Mother, would not make choyce rather to be Childleſſe, then to bring forth ſuch children as ſhould deale with them, as <hi>Nero</hi> dealt with his Mother? Proceed then: and as from the affections of earthly Fathers and Mothers, he diſputes againſt the abſoluteneſſe of Gods decrees, ſo alſo in the next place, let him conclude the like, to the utter overthrowing of Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. Yet who of our Divine ſaith, that God for one offence hath determined death and tortures to any reprobate of ripe years? Doe they not all profeſſe, that as many as dye in actuall ſinnes unrepented of, God determined to damne them for thoſe actuall ſinnes unrepented of? I doe not think he can alleadge any that denies this. Againe, what one of our Divines maintaines that Infants periſhing in originall ſinne, are damned for that ſinne, which is made theirs only by imputation? What a ſhameleſſe habit hath he gotten to himſelfe to deliver untruths? yet will he not (I warrant you) be accounted a Pelagian, neither will he plainly deny originall ſinne as <hi>Grevincovius</hi> is ſaid to have done, and that <hi>testibus convinci potuit.</hi> Their Tenets are nothing leſſe ſhamefull, then Pelagius his Tenets were, only they have not that inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity which Pelagius had, in profeſſing plainly, that there was no originall ſinne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed unto us by propagation.</p>
                              <p>Now he comes more cloſely unto the matter, yet but a little neither; a looſe and diſſolute diſcourſe is moſt ſuitable with his Genius.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne was no mans perſonall ſinne but <hi>Adams;</hi> true, for there was no man then but <hi>Adam;</hi> but all men being the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> were then in <hi>Adam,</hi> in that one perſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him all have ſinned, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. and without conſent to ſinne they could not ſinne.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. When he ſaith this ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> was not the ſinne of our nature by genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is ſo wild an expreſſion, that I profeſſe I cannot deviſe any tolerable ſenſe of it. That we were in <hi>Adam</hi> when he ſinned, it was fully ſufficient to bring upon us that corruption, that depth of corruption wherein we are all conceived and borne, and not by imputation. What Divine amongſt Papiſts or Proteſtants is he, that maintains, that <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, was the ſinne of our nature by imputation? This is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly one of Arminius his flowers, which this Author takes up among the reſt, to make himſelfe a noſegay to ſmell unto. It was Gods will that all ſhould ſtand or fall in him. For if it had pleaſed him, he could have deſtroyed <hi>Adam</hi> for his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and made a new ſtock, from whom to derive the World of Mankind: But reſolving all ſhould deſcend from him, he muſt withall reſolve, that upon the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> and of them all in him, they muſt take from him ſuch natures as <hi>Adams</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therein all our natures were made corrupt by ſinne; excepting Gods grace to provide better, both for <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity, as he thought good. So that look in what ſort <hi>Adams</hi> nature was corrupted by ſinne, in ſuch ſort muſt we receive cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt natures from him. Here <hi>Calvin</hi> is brought in with a robe of commendation, <hi>as an excellent ſervant of God:</hi> But God knowes his heart, and the hearts of all that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Gods truth in theſe poynts. Tis true that <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, both in reſpect of Gods power, to have propagated Mankind from another originall then from <hi>Adam</hi> as alſo in reſpect of his power, to reforme corrupt nature, in whomſoever it pleaſed him. But did <hi>Calvin</hi> think it poſſible, for corrupt nature, to propagate any other nature then it ſelfe is? God made man <hi>after his Image and likeneſſe;</hi> but afterwards we read that <hi>Adam</hi> brought forth a ſonne, <hi>after his Image and likeneſſe; who can bring a clean thing out of that which is uncleane,</hi> ſaith the book of <hi>Job? And that which is borne of fleſh is fleſh,</hi> ſaith our Saviour. But doth it herehence follow, or doth <hi>Calvin,</hi> or any Calviniſt, or Lutheran, or Papiſt, ſay, that <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne is made ours only by imputation? The caſe is not alike of other parents. For <hi>Adam</hi> was created in grace, and endued with the ſpirit of God: this holy condition was loſt by the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> and we receiving our natures from him, in the ſtate of his corruption, muſt therewithall receive, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bereaved of grace, and of the ſpirit of God. No ſuch detriment to our pure nature was wrought, or could be wrought, by the tranſgreſſion of any other proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor,

And God renewed <hi>Adam</hi> too, of his free grace after he was corrupt, and regenerated him by ſhewing mercy upon him; But this work proceeds according to the meer pleaſure of Gods will, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth ſaying, <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth.</hi>

                              <p n="4">4. Chriſt came into the World, to take away the ſinnes of the World, that is by ſatisfaction for ſinne, to merit the pardon of it, nor pardon of ſinne only, but ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſoule alſo; but for whom? ſurely for none but ſuch as ſhould ſooner or latter believe in him; for God hath ordained that theſe benefits of Chriſts death and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſhould not be diſtributed abſolutely, but conditionally, to wit, upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of faith. But as for the benefits of faith and repentance, theſe are not benefits communicable upon a condition; for what condition can precede them but a worke of man? and it was condemned 1200 years agoe: to ſay grace is given according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to merits, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> interprets ſimply of works; though Papiſts are apt enough to ſtand for merits, and the Apoſtle ſaith in plain tearmes, that God doth not call us <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 9.</note> according unto works; theſe therefore are communicated according to the meere pleaſure of Gods will: He might have given faith to all, but he would not, <hi>I will ſhew mercy on whom I will ſhew mercy, and I will have compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion.

Dares he himſelfe in plain termes deny this, namely that it nothing prejudiceth the courſe of Gods mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Elect? For what if by the ſinne wherein they are borne, they be made guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of eternall death, yet if God be pleaſed to pardon this ſinne, nor this only, but all actuall tranſgreſſions of theirs; yea, and break the yoake of their corruption, and as he ſeeth their wayes ſo to heale them, yea to heale their rebellions, and backſlidings, to ſubdue their iniquities, to rule them with a mighty hand, to make them paſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rod, and bring them unto the bond of the covenant, and when he hath brought them thither, to hold them there, to perfect the good work he hath begun in them; As he hath laid the foundation of his temple in their hearts, ſo to finiſh it, to be the Author and finiſher of their faith, and as of their faith, ſo of their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to hold them in his hands, ſo that none ſhall take them therehence, to keep them by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation, to build them upon a rock that the gates of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt them; either to deliver them from the howre of temptation, or to deliver them out of it, or ſo to order it, that it ſhall not be above their ſtrength, to be with them when they goe through the water, and through the fire, that the floods ſhall not overwhelme them, the fire ſhall not burne them, but as he leads them into it, ſo he will ſupport them in it, and lead them through it, as he led the Children of Iſrael into the red ſea, and in the red ſea (as an horſe in the Wilderneſſe, that they ſhould not ſtumble) and out of the red ſea, into the Wilderneſſe, and in the Wilderneſſe, and out of the Wilderneſſe; In a word, to fulfill the good pleaſure of his goodneſſe towards them, his grace in them, and every good work that he hath appoynted for them; in ſuch ſort that the beaſt ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile over them, untill they have finiſhed their teſtimony: and in which reſpect Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> even when the ſtones flew about his eares as thick as haile, ſeems to have gone to his death, as compoſedly as a man goes to his bed; having ended his Sermon firſt, his prayer for them in the next place, and laſtly the commending of his own ſpirit into the hands of God: this mercy, this rich mercy, this unſpeakable mercy, this Author moſt virulently, and moſt unconſcionably, in cunning and crafty carriage, labours to obſcure and deface, and to diſpute us out of the faith of it, if it lay in his power (which lies not in the power of the Devills themſelves) as much as himſelfe, and his informers ſcorne to apprehend any hope of it; And all this as unſipidly and unſcholaſtically, as profanely, by generall and indefinite termes, ſaying, by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ours <hi>God is not mercifull to men at all;</hi> wherein I gueſſe his lurking hole is, in the indefinite condition of the terme <hi>Men;</hi> for dares he ſay, that by this doctrine of ours

we make God unmercifull to all men, even to the very Elect? Yet when he ſaith, <hi>to men at all,</hi> the face of his diſcourſe in the common underſtanding of it, ſhould look this way.

And if he by children of God, underſtand all men created by him, and we, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe, whom God hath adopted in Chriſt and regenerated, I pray conſider, which of us, delivereth himſelfe in beſt congruity to the Scripture phraſe and meaning? Can he be ignorant, who they be whom the Scripture ſtiles <hi>veſſells of mercy?</hi> Or that theſe are ſet in oppoſition to <hi>veſſells of wrath;</hi> and would he have us as brainſick as himſelfe to put no difference in the accommodation of Gods mercy; between <hi>veſſells of mercy,</hi> and <hi>veſſells of wrath?</hi> As for the compariſon between men and other creatures, he is like himſelfe throughout in the execution thereof.</p>

Doth not he himſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that as the elect are but few amongſt them that are called, ſo the number of Reprobates, is farre greater then the number of the Elect? Doth not himſelfe maintaine, <hi>that God hath determined all reprobates</hi> (that is the moſt of men) <hi>by his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent decree, to ſuch a being as is a thouſand times worſe then no being at all,</hi> according to his judgement, and that this determination Divine is everlaſting? or though he dare not in plain tearmes deny, that God hath determined moſt of men to damnation. Doth he not here bewray the diſpoſition of his heart, namely, either to maintaine that Gods decrees are not everlaſting, nor determined concerning men, untill their deaths, or that they are of a revocable nature? Or will he fly to the qualification of the Divine decree here mentioned, and ſay that albeit the moſt part of men are deſtinated to damnation by the decree divine, yet not by an omnipotent decree? I gueſſe his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not by an abſolute, but by a conditionall decree; for as for any diſtinction of Divine decrees, into decrees omnipotent, I never yet read or heard; but this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being of a phraſifying ſpirit, we muſt permit him ſometimes to overlaſh, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhall not have occaſion to ſay of him, as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſaid ſometimes of <hi>Haterius, Haterius noſter ſufflaminandus eſt.</hi> But if by a conditionall decree only, God hath repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated thoſe whom he hath reprobated, then the decrees of reprobation cannot be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, but muſt needs be temporall; for <hi>res conditionata,</hi> the thing conditionated cannot exſiſt before the condition it ſelfe (whereupon it depends) hath exſiſtence. Now the condition of reprobation is meerly temporall, to wit, finall perſeverance in infidelity or impenitency.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. What if the condition of other creatures, be better then the condition of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates?

But then he will ſay, what ſhall become of all thoſe amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Gods mercy towards men, commended to us in holy Scripture? I anſwere they all have place concerning Gods children, Gods elect, the Scripture phraſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging no other veſſells of mercy, and counting all others in diſtinction from them veſſell of wrath; and one end whereto tends Gods providence towards theſe veſſells, the Apoſtle ſignifies plainly to be the amplification of his mercy towards the veſſells of mercy. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22, 23. Which may be unfolded thus, that by ſeeing the miſerable conditions of veſſells of wrath, they may be more ſenſible of Gods mercy towards them, in putting ſo gracious a difference between them.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. It cannot be denied, but God foreſaw what the condition of moſt men would be, if they were brought forth into the World; What then did God mean to bring them forth? Where was his mercy in this? Were it not a thouſand times better for them not to be borne? And by being borne, was it not infallible that their condition would be a thouſand times worſe then the condition of beaſts, according to this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors grave and Philoſophicall diſcourſe?</p>
                              <p n="4">4. Conſider though God foreſaw, that being ſo dealt withall, as God meant they ſhould be, they would never repent nor believe; yet ſeeing God had other means and motives in ſtore, which he knew full well would prove effectuall, to bring them to faith and repentance, were he pleaſed to uſe them; (as Arminius acknowledgeth,

For what if in the ſtate of nothing, they were ſo intelligent as this Author faines them, as to know to what end God made them, and thereupon, would not accept of life? What if afterwards they ſhould curſe the day of their birth, and wiſh they had been made Toads or Snakes?

                              <p>Now I ſee why he pretends to oppoſe the Sublapſarian way (keeping his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty upon every occaſion to ejaculate what his malice can ſuggeſt unto him againſt the Sublapſarian.) For only againſt the Sublapſarian way this objection hath place; and that not juſtly, but moſt unjuſtly, moſt untruely. For not one of them that I know, doth maintain that God by reprobation intended to damne, either <hi>Cain,</hi> or <hi>Judas,</hi> or <hi>Eſau,</hi> but for their actuall ſinnes and tranſgreſſions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented of. And as for thoſe Heathen Infants who periſh in originall ſinne, they periſh for that corruption wherein they are borne, which is as naturall unto them as the Leproſy of the Father, or any hereditary diſeaſe is naturally derived to the Child; by vertue whereof they are borne children of wrath, as the Apoſtle expreſſeth, and if to be borne children of wrath, be to be in a worſe condition then Devills, ſeeing to be borne children of wrath, is not our making; if it be of Gods making, and that according to Gods meer pleaſure; it muſt be acknowledged, that this is a worſe condition, and nevertheleſſe God is to be juſtified herein: <hi>and wiſdome is juſtified of her Children:</hi> and if Arminius will not concurre with us herein, ſure I am Papiſts will.

Farre better, our care be to avoid it, both as well by orthodoxy of Faith, as by holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life. And him that looks for ſalvation by grace it behooves, to look unto it, how he ſhapes this grace of God, leaſt if he be found to mock God, giving the main ſtock of his converſion to his own Free will, rather then unto God, he may be mocked in the end, and meet with no better Salvation, then the liberty of his will can procure him, which will prove condemnation rather then ſalvation. See (I pray) what giddineſſe of ſpirit he betrayes, in laying ſuch a crimination to our charge, whereunto himſelfe is obnoxious in an equall degree, or in a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree then wee. For he hath confeſſed, that God of his meer pleaſure, makes all Infants guilty of eternall death; now where appears the greater rigour? on our ſide, who ſay, God inflicts eternall death on none, but ſuch as are guilty of eternall death? or rather on his ſide who ſaith, that God of his meer pleaſure, makes men guilty of eternall death?</p>

The ſecond is, that their inevitable deſtination to deſtruction, is under ſhew of the contrary: the Devills as they are decreed to damnation, ſo they know it, but men even thoſe that are appointed unto <hi>wrath, are yet fed up with hopes of ſalvation.</hi> Is it poſſible that a man in his right witts ſhould ſo miſerably forget, and ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully carry himſelfe? Doth not he himſelfe maintain that all reprobates are from everlaſting appoynted to eternall death? It may be his meaning is, that no reprobate is appoynted to eternall death untill his death; ſo making Gods decrees temporall, and denying them to be eternall. But if this be his opinion, what Arminian or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant concurres with him in this? But if reprobation and election be eternall; how doe we feed reprobates up with the hope of ſalvation, more then he himſelfe? Doth he think none but the elect are his heares?

The Divells, becauſe they must be damned, are not commanded to believe in Chriſt, yet poore men muſt be tied to believe in Christ, and their torments muſt be encreaſed if they believe not.</hi> I make no doubt but this Author is as confident of his learned and judicious carriage in ſhaping this compariſon, as that <hi>the fruit of Adams ſinne is the guilt of eternall death in all mankind.</hi> But none ſo bold (we commonly ſay) as blind Bayard: and it ſeems either he knowes not, or conſiders not, that the firſt ſinne of Angells was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them as death unto man; that ſinne placed them <hi>extra viam,</hi> and <hi>in termino incur abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis miſeriae,</hi> as death only <hi>placeth</hi> wicked men in the like caſe. Now we doe not ſay that God commands man after he is dead to believe in Chriſt, any more then he commands obedience unto Angells, ſince their caſe is become deſperate. The Divells are not commanded to believe or repent, becauſe God doth not, nor never did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to damne any of them for want of faith, or of repentance, but for their firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy from God. But it is otherwiſe with man, for God doth not purpoſe to damne any of them but for ſinne unrepented of. And therefore as good reaſon there is, why their damnation ſhould be encreaſed, for want of repentance and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of Gods truth, as why the Devills ſhould be damned for their firſt Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. If perhaps (as it is likely enough) this Author to hold up his compariſon, ſhall fly to God decree of reprobation, upon ſuppoſition whereof, it was impoſſible that men ſhould either believe or repent; I anſwere firſt, that in like ſort upon ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods foreknowledge, that they would neither believe nor repent, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as neceſſarily, as it is neceſſary that Gods knowledge ſhould be infallible, that it was impoſſible they ſhould believe and repent: and the like followeth as neceſſarily of the Apoſtacy of Angells, as of the infidelity and impenitency of man.

Now howſoever I know the Arminian party cannot ſwallow this morſell; yet by this it appears how ſuperſiciary is that augmentation of the difference between Men and Angells, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with this Author contents himſelfe: yet notwithſtanding it is not want of faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that condemneth any man; by want of Faith man is leſt to the covenant of works, to ſtand or fall according to his own righteouſneſſe or unrighteouſneſſe: whereof if he faile, and withall deſpiſeth the counſell or God offered him in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, is there noe good reaſon, his condemnation ſhould be the greater? For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is in the power of a naturall man, to afford as much faith to this, as to many a vile and fabulous relation, which is farre leſſe credible by judgement naturall: we ſee both prophane perſons and hypocrites, ſo farre to believe the Goſpell, as to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a formall profeſſion thereof, and ſometimes proceed ſo farre therein, as that 'tis a hard matter to diſtinguiſh them from ſincere profeſſors: yet we ſay a true faith is only ſuch as is infuſed into the heart of man, by the ſpirit of God in regeneration.

Now, what one of our Divines can be repreſented, that ever was known to affirme, that the damnation of any man ſhall be encreaſed, becauſe God did not regenerate him, and in regeneration inſpire a Divine faith into him? As for our anſwer in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to this argument conſidered in briefe, and this Authors reply; my refutation thereof I diſpatcht in the firſt place. Although he carrieth himſelfe not fairely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the anſwer on our part; in as much as therein he mixeth the conſideration of juſtice divine, which is aliene from the preſent purpoſe, with the conſideration of mercy divine, which alone is congruous; that ſo while he puts off the plenary juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his reply, to that which is aliene, he may ſeem to undertake a full juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his reply to the whole. But I hope we ſhall be as able by Gods aſſiſtance, to manifeſt his ſiniſter carriage in the interpretation of Gods juſtice, as we have done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, as touching his accommodation of Gods mercy.</p>

                                 <p>VVIth us Chriſtians there is no doubt or queſtion made of the truth of this, that God is righteous in all his waies: yea though he command <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice his ſonne; and though he cauſed not only <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> to be ſtoned for his treſpaſſing about the excommunicate thing, but his children alſo with him; and though he viſit the ſinne of Fathers upon the Children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate him. And though in the drowning of the World, he cauſed Infants to periſh with their parents, ſome in their Mothers wombe, ſome hanging on their Mothers breaſts: And ſo in the deſtruction of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> with fire from heaven. And not ſo only, but the righteous God hath given us power over inferiour creatures, to weare them out in ſerving our turnes with them, yea and to knock them in the heads, to cut their throats, and ſtrangle them as we think good: and we are no whit the more unrighteous in executing this power, which God hath given us upon them: yea in giving his own and holy Sonne to be reviled, blaſpheamed, betrayed, condemned, crucified, ſo to make his ſoule an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our ſinnes. In all theſe waies the Lord is righteous, and holy in all his works, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 11.

Where is yours ſaith the other? Why, ſaith he, the place I mentioned is in the 37 <hi>Pſahne.</hi> So is mine too, ſaith the other. But proceed we along with him: Whereas he ſaith Gods judgements are without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is untrue, for we find the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to take notice of exceptions made againſt the waies of God in ſome particular caſts; as when God hath mercy on <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 18, 19, 20, 21.</note> whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth: upon the propoſall of this Doctrine the Apoſtle takes notice of ſuch an exception as this. Thou wilt ſay then, why doth he yet complaine, for who hath reſiſted his will: and the juſtification hereof, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle derives from no other conſideration then this, that God is our Creator, and we are his creatures: And that as the Potter hath power over the clay of the ſame lump, to make one veſſell to honour, and another to diſhonour; ſo hath God. <hi>O man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) who art thou that diſputeſt with God, ſhall the thing formed, ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the clay?</hi> And as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>That Gods judgements are like a great deepe:</hi> So the Apoſtle profeſſeth, <hi>That his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are unſearcheable, and his waies paſt finding out.</hi> And in the common opinion this is <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33.</note> delivered as touching the depth of Gods counſell in reprobation and predeſtination; and by the coherence of the words, with that which goes before it, appears to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon Gods diſpenſing and denying grace to whom he will, and when he will; As for example; like as there was a time when God had a Church in the World, without diſtinction of Jewes and Gentiles, ſo afterwards the providence of God was to diſplay it ſelfe after three ſeverall waies, the firſt was in gathering a Church unto himſelfe out of the World, from out of the poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> theſe were called the Jewes, in diſtinction from the Gentiles, who for a long time had not obtained mercy, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 30. <hi>In as much as they believed not:</hi> And this diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of grace peculiar unto the Jewes, with rejection of the Gentiles, continued for about 1600 years. Then God gathered a Church among the Gentiles, with rejection of the Jewes, as the Apoſtle ſignifies in the place before alleadged, ſaying, <hi>now you have obtained mercy through their unbeliefe.</hi> And this diſpenſation of Gods grace peculiar unto the Gentiles, hath continued now, for about 1600 years. And we believe a time ſhall come, for the calling of the Jewes, and then the Church of God ſhall conſiſt both of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56120:81"/>
Jewes and Gentiles, and the generall calling of them, as the Apoſtle ſignifies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 12. If the fall of them be the riches of the World, and the diminiſhing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fulneſſe: and v. 15. If the caſting away of them be the reconciling of the World, what ſhall the receiving of them be but life from the dead: and v. 31. Even ſo have theſe alſo now not believed, that through your (Gentiles) mercy, they alſo (the Jewes) might obtain mercy. For God hath concluded them all under unbeliefe, that he might have mercy on all. And hereupon it is, that the Apoſtle breaks forth into admiration of this various providence of God, and different diſpenſation of his grace, ſaying, <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdome and knowledge of God, how unſearcheable are his judgements, and his waies paſt finding out?</hi> So that albeit the juſtice of God, be apparent to the underſtanding of man in ſome of his waies, yet not in all. Neither doth it follow, that becauſe God offers the juſtice of his courſes, to the triall of humane underſtanding in ſome particulars, therefore he offers it to the ſame triall in all; or that the underſtanding of man is able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it in all. Not only carnall men cry out ſometimes, Where is the God of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 17. Again, it is in vain to ſerve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his commandements, that we have walked humbly before the Lord of hoſts? But even the children of wiſdome, which are apt to juſtify her, are yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times offended through weakneſſe of faith, or want of judgement to comprehend the depth of Gods providence, when they have conſidered the ſtrange proſperity of the wicked, as <hi>Job.</hi> 21. 6, 7, 8. and <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 73. and <hi>Jeremy, Jer.</hi> 12.</p>
                                 <p>But to conſider punctually the inſtances here particulated. Firſt not one of them treats of Gods decrees, though this Author boldly claps then in amongſt the waies of God: And theſe places throughout entreat not of the decrees themſelves, but of the executions of Gods decrees. As that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Judge I pray you between me and my vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard;</hi> yet this was meere grace and not juſtice; but the laying of it waſt, (as there he threatneth) for the unfruitfulneſſe thereof, was juſt even in the conſcience of man: So likewiſe the waies of God mentioned, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. 25. are moſt equall, as namely in rewarding the obedient, and puniſhing the diſobedient. In like ſort there is no queſtion to be made of Gods decrees, concerning the rewarding the one, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other. And it is as true, that all this is nothing to the purpoſe. The main queſtion being touching Gods decree, to give the grace of obedience to one, and deny it unto others; and of the execution hereof, in ſhewing mercy on whom he will, and <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 18;</note> hardning whom he will. No reaſon hereof can be deviſed by man without falling into manifeſt abſurdity, or manifeſt hereſy, or both. It is true God will not ſlay the righteous with the wicked: for the Infants of wicked Parents, untill God be pleaſed to regenerate them, are not to be accounted righteous, as being borne children of wrath. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 3. And therefore as in the conflagration of Sodome, God took a courſe to ſave righteous <hi>Lot,</hi> yet the Infant children of the Sodomites were conſumed <note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> in the ſame fire with their Parents. And in like manner I anſwere to that of <hi>Moſes. Num.</hi> 16. 22. <hi>Shall one man ſinne, and wilt thou be angry with all the congregation?</hi> You know though <hi>Korah</hi> might be, and in likelihood he was the principall inſtigator yet <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Eliab,</hi> and <hi>On,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Peleth,</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Reuben</hi> joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him in the ſeparation, and with theſe were joyned no leſſe then 250 Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the aſſembly, and they famous in the congregation and men of renowne. Nor did thoſe alone periſh in this their ſeparation, but their families alſo. So that whereas when <hi>Moſes</hi> exhorted all the reſt to depart from the tents of thoſe wicked men, and thereupon <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> came out and ſtood in the doore of the Tent, with their Wives, and their Sonnes, and their little Children, all theſe were ſwallowed up, and went downe quick into the pit: and doe you think their little Children were partners with them in this conſpiracy? And is not this judgement ſtrange? What can juſtify this, but the power of God, is Lord over his creature, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with that originall corruption that is found in every one when they come into the world? Gueſſe, I pray, how happy this Author is in his obſervations. This makes me remember, how at my firſt coming into this place, having to deale with certain Browniſts, being willed thereunto by our Dioceſan: An old man among the reſt, was willing to conferre, ſo we would give him liberty to open his mind at full; we willingly condeſcended unto him, and thereupon he began to alleadge places of Scripture to juſtify his ſeparation; and whereſoever he found the word ſeperate, that he took up for an argument on his ſide (like him that did ſet downe every ſhip that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56120:82"/>
arrived in the harbour at <hi>Athens,</hi> as one of his ſhipps) and amongſt the reſt, this 16 chapter of Numbers afforded him one authority v. 21. where the Lord ſpeaks unto <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſaying, <hi>ſeparate your ſelves from among this congregation;</hi> whereunto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; here indeed is a ſeparation commanded, but from whom? Surely from thoſe who roſe up in rebellion againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> Now if you can prove us to be ſuch, as riſe up in rebellion againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> then, in the name of God <hi>ſeparate your ſelves from us:</hi> But if we are not the men that riſe up in rebellion againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> but you rather, then are not you commanded to ſeparate from us, but we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are commanded to ſeparate from you; yet we deſire only, that you will not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from us, and all ſhall be well. But to returne, what doth this author think? Was God in a paſſion, or ſomething precipitate when he ſaid, <hi>ſeparate your ſelves from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong this congregation, that I may conſume them all at once,</hi> and did <hi>Moſes</hi> moderate him as being more-ſtaid of the two? I hope, if God had done as much as he offered to doe, his action had been iuſtifiable, as well in the one as in the other. Certainly God ſhould be juſt, even in turning his holy Angells into nothing: and was juſt in expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his holy Sonne to tortures unexpreſſable upon the croſſe; other manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, then were thoſe which were uſed towards <hi>Adonibezek</hi> and <hi>Mauricius:</hi> they juſtified God from conſideration of their former ſinnes: No ſuch courſe of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could have place in annihilating Angells, or had courſe in breaking the Holy Sonne of God for our iniquities. Yet theſe inſtances are remarkable to obſerve there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the felicity of this Authors diſcourſe. For firſt, was it God indeed that executed this judgement upon <hi>Adonibezek?</hi> Now the Text ſaith, the children of <hi>Judah</hi> were <note place="margin">Judg. 1. 6, 7.</note> they that dealt thus with him: did God then uſe their free wills, as his inſtruments for the execution of this judgement? And how was this? Was it by working them hereunto, or only by concurring with them to this act, as foreſeeing they would doe ſuch an act, and thereupon decreeing to concurre to the producing of that act? If God did work them hereunto, then can God work the will of any man to the doing of any free act freely: for who dares ſay that the children of Iſrael did not as freely doe this as ought elſe? But if God only concurred with them, to the doing of it <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do vellent,</hi> and only, upon foreſight that they would doe it, decreed to concurre to the doing of it, calls he this Gods execution of judgement, depending meerely upon the pleaſure of man foreſeen by God?</p>
                                 <p>As for the out-rage executed upon <hi>Mauricius</hi> by <hi>Phocas,</hi> this was no leſſe then abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable villany, as committed by him. Yet if God uſed him as an inſtrument herein, to execute his iudgement, then God by the ſinfull act of one, can and doth puniſh the ſame of another, and conſequently God muſt be the Author of that ſinfull act, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he puniſheth another, and that by Arminius his rule, which is this, <hi>Omnis paena non permittitur ſed infligitur a Deo, &amp; habet Deum authorem.</hi> Now I come to conſider his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of ſo impertinent a diſcourſe. He ſaith <hi>abſolute reprobation cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with this juſtice Divine:</hi> we ſay there is no need at all of reconcilement: for what an inſipid thing is it, to talke of a courſe of reconciling them, who were never at odds? But he takes upon him to prove the repugnancy between them by three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. The firſt whereof is this. <hi>It makes God to puniſh the righteous with the wicked, as it is taught the Supralapſarian way directly.</hi> I confeſſe here is a direct ſomewhat, but whether a direct truth, or a direct lye, let the indifferent judge. He adventureth the proofe of it thus: <hi>The Supralapſarians preſent man in his decree of Reprobation conſidered without ſinne:</hi> that is true I confeſſe, and it is as true that they preſent him conſidered without righteouſneſſe alſo; and for good reaſon, becauſe Gods decree was eternall, and the creature at that time had no being &amp; to conſider a thing that hath no being, as having being, is not ſo much <hi>conſiderare,</hi> to conſider, as <hi>errare</hi> or <hi>fingere,</hi> to <hi>erre</hi> or <hi>feign,</hi> this I have delivered in my <hi>Vindiciae gratiae Dei,</hi> and that in the firſt part of the firſt book. And this Author pretends he hath read the ſecond, yet he takes no courſe to refute this or ought elſe. But let him goe on. <hi>God</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>is made by them to determine the infliction of miſery on men without conſideration of ſinne, either Originall or actuall.</hi> Firſt, let it be granted, yet herehence it followeth not, that <hi>he is made to be a deſtroyer of the righteous, or to puniſh the righteous with the wicked,</hi> which was that he affirmed. To determine puniſhment is one thing, to puniſh is another thing. Certainly in the opinion of thoſe he ſpeaks of, God puniſheth none but the wicked; the very conſcience of this Author cannot but convict him of falſhood in this crimination: For certainly by their opinion it doth
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56120:82"/>
not follow but that every one is found wicked, when God doth puniſh him. I may as well ſay in moſt abſolute congruity, that by their opinion, God doth puniſh men, before they have any being by creation: for ſuch they were indeed, and neither wicked nor righteous, when God paſſed the decree of reprobation upon them. But neither doe theſe Divines maintain, that God did decree to damne any man but for ſinne. Nay, I goe farther: let the object of reprobation be men not yet created, and ſo conſidered, as I have proved it to be ſo, herehence it no way followes, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of reprobration, is in any moment of reaſon or nature, before the conſideration or <hi>citra conſiderationem peccati:</hi> and this alſo have I proved. This Author boldly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the contrary to be true, without any proofe, yet pretends he hath read my <hi>Vindiciae Gratiae Dei</hi> farther off then where I have handled this. I ſay he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it, but I doe not know how he comes by this, it may be as Capons come by Chickens.</p>
                                 <p>Hence he proceeds to the Sublapſarians alſo, the whole Synod of Dort (as 'tis ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) our Brittain Divines, and all; <hi>for againſt their way he hath tyed himſelfe to bend his reaſons,</hi> but ſo, that as the Pope by his grants, doth never bind his own hands, for this Author hath power to untye himſelfe at pleaſure, and to fly out againſt the Supra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſarians alſo: as <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did againſt the two Perſian challengers; but he was put thereunto, becauſe they contrary to the compact, ſet both at once on him. But this champion like a tall fellow, and of a brave ſpirit, as if he ſhould not have his hands full of a whole Synod, lets fly at all: They indeed, I mean the Sublapſarians, conſider mankind in originall ſinne; this he may well ſuppoſe: but he goes farther, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth alſo, that <hi>this ſinne is made ours only by Gods order and appoyntment:</hi> For ſo, ſaith he, <hi>they in effect doe ſay.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p n="1">1. <hi>That God did lay upon every man, a neceſſity of being borne in Originall ſinne.</hi> But in this alſo he ſpeaks at pleaſure, quoting no paſſage of any Author. God may be ſaid to lay upon man a neceſſity of eternall condemnation, dying in ſinne unrepented of: yet no ſober man will ſay, that God is the author of a mans condemnation, by Gods only or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and pleaſure; For this implies, that there is no meritorious cauſe of condemnation in man. God (we ſay) of meer pleaſure, beſtowes the grace of repentance on whom he will; becauſe he finds all equall in naturall corruption, and no difference in any, whereby to move God to beſtow grace on him rather then on another. The caſe is not alike when God comes to beſtow ſalvation and inflict damnation; for ſome he finds dying in ſinnes, others dying in the Lord: yet we deny not but by power abſolute, and ſecluding the determination of his own will, he could annihilate the righteous as well as the wicked. In like ſort the whole courſe of nature depends meerely upon the pleaſure of God: yet we ſay it is naturall for a Leprous perſon, to beget a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous perſon: and ſo as naturall it is, for that which is borne of the fleſh to be fleſh, though each depends upon the conſtitution of God. For albeit <hi>Adam</hi> loſt the ſpirit of God by his tranſgreſſion, and all ſupernaturall graces wherewith he was endued; yet like as God by regeneration, of his meere pleaſure reſtored them afterwards to <hi>Adam,</hi> and in due time doth reſtore them to every one of his Elect: ſo in their very concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it pleaſed God, he could for Chriſts ſake infuſe them; notwithſtanding the ſinne of <hi>Adam;</hi> and conſequently it is the free act of God, in refuſing after this manner to deale with them. Yet this nothing hinders, but that the propagation of ſpirituall corruption unto all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, may be as naturall as the propagation of any hereditary diſeaſe from the Father to the child: and over and above, that it is not in the way of meer pleaſure, but in the way of juſtice; for the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> which was the ſinne of our nature, bereaving him of that originall righteouſneſſe wherein he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                                    </gap>reated: and cauſing all mankind to be, 1. Derived from him, whereas he could have otherwiſe provided, 2. And that from <hi>Adam</hi> after his nature was corrupt with ſinne, whereas he could have derived poſterity from him before his fall, had it pleaſed him. And therefore I approve the ſecond Canon of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> whereunto our Engliſh Divines with many others ſubſcribed: where they profeſſe, that the corruption derived from <hi>Adam</hi> to his poſterity was, <hi>per vitioſae naturae propagationem juſto Dei iudicio de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivata.</hi> This I take to be much different from ſaying, <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne is made ours by meer pleaſure, or by imputation only. So the fifteenth Article in the confeſſion <hi>Eccleſiarum Belgicarum</hi> runs thus; <hi>Credimus Adami in obedientiâ, peccatum originis in totum genus humanum diffuſum eſſe: quod eſt totius naturae corruptio, &amp; vitium haereditarium, quo &amp; ipſi infantes in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris ſuae utero polluti ſunt, quodque veluti radix omne peccatorum genus in homine producit; ideo<expan>

                                 <p n="2">2. The Second thing he puts upon our Divines is, <hi>That God hath determined for that ſinne, to caſt away the farre greater part of mankind for ever: and ſo they make God to doe that by two acts, the one accompanying the other, which the other ſay he did by one.</hi> To which I anſwer, Firſt, that if they ſay that God doth no more by two acts, then, the other ſay, God did by one, ſeeing I have proved that the other doe no way maintain that God doth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the righteous with the wicked, which is his immodeſt and unſhamefac't crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; no nor doe they maintain, that God determined to damne any but for ſinne, and which is more then that, ſuppoſing <hi>humanum genus nondum conditum,</hi> to be the object of reprobation, yet doth it not follow, that in any moment of nature, the decree of damnation is before the conſideration of ſinne; ſurely neither will it follow, by the Sublapſarian Doctrine, that God doth not decree to puniſh any man with damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but for thoſe ſinnes wherein he dyeth unrepented of; much leſſe that God doth puniſh the righteous with the wicked, which is the crimination of this Author, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, I doubt, againſt his own conſcience. Tis true, ſome periſh only in originall ſinne, and that juſtly: for if they be borne children of wrath, is it ſtrange if they dye children of wrath? And is it not juſt with God to inflict eternall death on them, whom this Author profeſſeth to be guilty of eternall death? only he ſaith, that God of his meer pleaſure, makes them guilty of eternall death: That is his ſaying, not ours: For though we ſay originall ſinne makes a man guilty of eternall death, by the free conſtitution of God; yet we ſay not, that this free conſtitution of God was made of his meer pleaſure, but <hi>juſto Dei judicio<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                                    </hi> like as whoſoever believes not ſhall be damned, here damnation is by the free conſtitution of God, made the portion of unbelievers: but dares this Author inferre herehence, that it is not made ſo <hi>juſto Dei judicio?</hi> indeed God gives grace according to the meere pleaſure of his will: but no wiſe man will ſay, that he damnes men according to the meere pleaſure of his will; for this phraſe implies, that there is no cauſe thereof on mans part: And indeed there is no cauſe on mans part, why God ſhould give him grace, but there is cauſe enough on mans part, why God ſhould inflict damnation on him, and yet this work of God though juſt, is never a whit the leſſe free. So in damning for originall ſinne only, though Gods conſtitution hereof be juſt, yet is it never a whit the leſſe free; and though it be free, yet it is never a whit the leſſe juſt: And like as damnation is infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on finall impenitents, <hi>ſola Dei conſtitutione,</hi> only by vertue of this conſtitution Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, <hi>whoſoever repents not of his ſinne ſhall be damned;</hi> (for it is apparent, God might have annihilated them, had it ſo pleaſed him) yet is it never a whit the leſſe juſt. In like ſort it is by the ſole conſtitution of God, that originall ſinne is propagated to all men, Chriſt excepted. for God could have derived mankind from another ſtock af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Adams</hi> fall: and as he doth regenerate men uſually by his word, ſo he might if it pleaſed him, in their very conception give them his ſpirit, and thoſe ſupernaturall graces, whereof <hi>Adam</hi> was deprived by ſinne: yet the propagation of ſinne from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> to poſterity. is never a whit the leſſe juſt; no nor any whit the leſſe naturall; like as the whole courſe of nature, depends upon the alone conſtitution of God. But when I ſay that God can without reſpect of ſinne, inflict any torment upon his creature, this is delivered of power abſolute. This power the Lord did execute upon his own ſonne: for what was his ſinne? Was he not the ſpotleſſe lamb of God? Yet what ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies did he ſuffer in the garden, what torments and terrours upon the croſſe, when hee cryed out <hi>My God, my God, Why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> But the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56120:83"/>
like power he doth not execute on us, only he gives us authority to exerciſe the like power over other creatures: if the powder of an Hare burnt alive in an Oven, be found to be wholſome for us, he gives us leave thus to deale with him, and the like: yet have not theſe creatures ſinned either againſt God, or againſt us. Of this abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power of God, I have diſcourſed more ſparingly in the place cited by him, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>De Electione, digreſ.</hi> 3. If this Author hath any mind to except againſt it, either in whole or in part, he might have tried his ſtrength, and not contented himſelfe, with ſhewing his teeth only. Yet by his leave, whether thoſe he ſpeaks of, will concurre with me in this, it is more then I know, but to ſerve his turne at this preſent againſt thoſe whom he hath tyed himſelfe to oppoſe, as he profeſſeth, he cares little what he avoucheth to ſave himſelfe of farther pains. By the way let me take notice of one argument more then I dreamt of, for the maintenance of Gods abſolute power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict any pain upon a creature, and that of his meer pleaſure, which this Author ere he is aware ſuggeſts unto me; And accordingly thus I diſpute. If God can out of his meer pleaſure make a man guilty of eternall death, ſurely it ſeems that of his meer pleaſure he may inflict eternall death on any. But God can of his meer pleaſure make a man guilty of eternall death, as I prove out of this Author, who profeſſeth that God out of his meer pleaſure, made all mankind guilty of eternall death: Now we commonly ſay, that <hi>ab actu ad potentiam valet argumentum.</hi> And ſee farther how miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he overlaſheth. The higheſt degree whereunto he can improve the harſhneſſe of our Doctrine is this, that we ſhould teach, that <hi>God doth decree the miſery of an innocent man.</hi> Now I pray conſider, is it not as harſh, that God ſhould decree the death, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonics, the ſorrowes, and tortures of an innocent man? And is it not apparent, that God decreed the death and thoſe unſpeakable ſorrowes of his innocent ſonne? Yet we ſay not that God decreed any other mans death or damnation, but only for ſinne. But it is all one in his opinion to ſay, <hi>God decrees the miſery of an innocent man, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he ſhall be involved in a ſinne, that ſo he may be brought to miſery.</hi> Firſt, I ſay his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is no Oracle, if it were, the world would ſoon grow wild. Secondly, this ſufficeth not to prove his crimination, which was this, that by our Doctrine, we make God <hi>to puniſh the righteous with the wicked,</hi> not that we make God to doe that which is all one in ſubſtance. Thirdly, his beſt arguments are his phraſes, whereby he hopes to ſeaſon others affections as well as his own; as in ſaying God purpoſed man ſhall be involved in ſinne: For if he ſpeake of mankind, made guilty of the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> he forgets his own Tenet; that <hi>God of his meer pleaſure makes Adams ſinne the ſinne of his poſterity,</hi> and thereby of his meer pleaſure makes them guilty of eternall death. And as touching our Tenet herein, is there any ſuch harſhneſſe in ſaying, that God cauſeth a leprous child to be borne of Leprous parents? But if he ſpeak it in generall of any ſinne, for which any man is damned, our Doctrine is, that the ſinnes which come to paſſe, muſt needs be permitted by God, and for God to permit any ſinne, is to will that ſuch a ſinne ſhall come to paſſe by Gods permiſſion. <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe profeſſing, that if God permit a man to will that which is evill, <hi>Neceſſe eſt ut nullo argumentorum genere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuadeatur ad nolendum.</hi> And the Scripture is expreſſe as touching the fouleſt actions that ever were committed by man, to wit, in the moſt contumelious uſages of the ſonne of God, namely that <hi>both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, together with the Gentiles, and people of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell were gathered together, to doe what Gods hand, and Gods Counſell had predetermined to be done.</hi> And when <hi>Fulgentius</hi> ſaith, that God had been unjuſt, if he had predeſtinated <hi>ſtantem ad ruinam; ad ruinam</hi> here is <hi>ad peccatum,</hi> and Predeſtination in the Fathers ſenſe, is only <hi>eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum quae Deus ipſe facturus erat,</hi> which God himſelfe meant to effect, not what he meant to ſuffer.

                                 <p>IN this diſcourſe on the poynt of Gods juſtice, this Author ſeems to ſtorme, and ſhewes great confidence of bearing downe all before him: but the more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous will it prove in the iſſue, when it ſhall appeare, that all this wind beats down no corne. He takes his riſe from a particular opinion of <hi>Zanchy,</hi> whoſe opinion is, that all, even Reprobates are bound to believe they are elected in Chriſt unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, though never they ſhall believe nor can believe. But doth this Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe concurre with <hi>Zanchy</hi> in this opinion? If he did, I preſume it were upon ſome better ground then the authority of <hi>Zanchy;</hi> and in all likelihood we ſhould have heard of thoſe grounds: or doth himſelfe believe, that that paſſage <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 9. <hi>He ſhall convict the World of ſinne, becauſe they believed not in me,</hi> doth evince as much, or import as much
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56120:84"/>
as that is, whereunto <hi>Zanchy</hi> drives it? If he doth not concurre with <hi>Zanchy</hi> in either of theſe, why ſhould he tye us to the particular authority of <hi>Zanchy?</hi> Muſt we be bound to ſtand to every interpretation of our Divines, or every particular opinion of theirs, wherein perhaps they were ſingular? Secondly, ſuppoſe this opinion of <hi>Zanchy</hi> be a truth, and ſuppoſe we concurre with him herein, will it from this opinion follow, that therefore even Reprobates, have power to believe? Who ſeeth not that it is a flat contradiction to the antecedent? For the Doctrine of <hi>Zanchy</hi> as here it is related, is this, that even Reprobates, though they cannot believe, yet are they bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Now will it herehence follow that therefore they have power to believe? Whereas it is manifeſtly ſuppoſed in the antecedent that they cannot believe. And to my underſtanding, the diſtinction of Elect and Reprobate in this caſe is moſt unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. For to what end doe we Preach unto our hearers, that all ſorts of men are bound to believe, but this, to wit, that every one that heareth us, being privy to his condition, may underſtand that he, of what condition ſoever he be, which is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be better known to him, then to the Preacher, or at leaſt as well, is bound to believe. But as for theſe different conditions of elect and reprobate, no man can be privy to the one, untill he doth believe; nor to the other, untill finall perſeverance in unbeliefe. And if I liſt, I could alleadge the opinion of another Divine (who is very peremptory in his way) profeſſing that the Miniſters calling upon us to believe, is no commandement at all, but like a Kings gracious Proclamation unto certain malifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, who are all accuſed of High Treaſon, giving them to underſtand, that in caſe they will voluntarily confeſſe their ſinne, and accept of his gracious pardon offered them, he will moſt graciouſly pardon them. But if they will not, but ſtand rather to their triall, preſuming to acquit themſelves right well, and prove themſelves to be true Subjects, let them ſtand to the adventure, and iſſue of their tryall. And that thus the covenant of grace is offered to be received by them only, who feare to come, and dare not come to the tryall of the Covenant of works. But I will not content my ſelfe, in putting off <hi>Zanchy</hi> in this manner; although by the way I cannot but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that were I of their opinion, who teach that God gives unto all and every one, when they come into the World, a certain grace, for the enlivening of their wills, whereby they are enabled to will any ſpirituall good, whereto they ſhall be excited; I ſee no reaſon but that the way is open to everlaſting life, as well by the covenant of works, as by the covenant of grace: for let perfect obedience be the ſpirituall good whereto they are excited, let them but will it, as it is ſuppoſed they can; and then God will be ready to concurre to the doing of it, like as to the work in us <gap reason="foreign">

                                 <p>Thirdly therefore conſider we the conſtant Doctrine of Divines, not that Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates are bound to believe, but that all that heare the Goſpell are bound to believe: but in what ſenſe? <hi>Piſcator</hi> ſaith, as I remember, that the thing, which all ſuch are bound to believe, is the Goſpell; according to that <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. <hi>Repent ye and believe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell.</hi> Now to believe the Goſpell is one thing, the ſumme whereof is this, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave ſinners;</hi> but to believe in Chriſt is another thing, which yet this Author diſtinguiſheth not, though it appears by the courſe of his argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he draws to this meaning, and that in a particular ſenſe, which is this, <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Chriſt died for them;</hi> as appears expreſſely in the latter end of this Section. And no marvaile if this Author carry himſelfe ſo confidently in this, being, as he is, armed with ſuch confidence. But I am glad that in one place or other, he ſprings his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we may have the fairer flight at him, to pull down his pride, and ſweep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his vain conſidence: though we deale upon the moſt plauſible argument of the Arminians, and which they think inſoluble. My anſwer is; firſt, Look in what ſenſe <hi>Arminius</hi> ſaith Chriſt died for us, in the ſame ſenſe we may be held to ſay (without prejudice to our Tenet) of abſolute reprobation, that all who heare the Goſpell are bound to believe that Chriſt died for them. For the meaning that Arminius makes of Chriſts dying for us, is this, Chriſt dyed, for this end, that ſatisfaction being made for ſinne, the Lord now may pardon ſinne, upon what condition he will; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is to dye for obtaining a poſſibility of the redemption of all, but for the actuall redemption of none at all. Secondly, But I liſt not to content my ſelfe with this;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56120:85"/>
therefore I farther anſwer, by diſtinction of the phraſe of dying for us, that we may not cheat our ſelves by the confounding of things that differ. To dye for us, or for all, is to dye for our benefit, or for the benefit of all: Now theſe benefits are of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature, whereof ſome are beſtowed upon man only conditionally (though for Chriſts ſake) and they are the pardon of ſinne and Salvation of the Soule, and theſe God doth conferre only upon the condition of faith and repentance. Now I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to profeſſe, and that, I ſuppoſe, as out of the mouth of all our Divines, that every one who hears the Goſpell (without diſtinction between Elect and Reprobate) is bound to believe that Chriſt died for him, ſo farre as to procure both the pardon of his ſinnes, and the ſalvation of his ſoule, in caſe he believe and repent. But there are other benefits, which Chriſt by his obedience hath merited for us, namely, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of faith and repentance. <hi>For it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell, Col.</hi> 1. And <hi>He hath bleſſed us with all ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt,</hi> that is, for Chriſts ſake: and <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 3. Heb. 13. 21.</note> God works in us, <hi>that which is pleaſing in his ſight through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing is more pleaſing in Gods ſight on our part, then faith and repentance, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven theſe alſo, I ſhould think, God works in us through Jeſus Chriſt: and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle praies in the behalfe of the Epheſians, for peace, and faith, and love from God <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 23.</note> the Father, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that is, as I interpret it, from God the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt, as an efficient cauſe, and from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, God and Man, as a meritorious cauſe thereof. Now I demand whether this Author can ſay truly, that tis the conſtant opinion of our Divines, that all who heare the Goſpell, whether Elect or Reprobate, are bound to believe, that Chriſt dyed to procure them faith and repentance. Nay doth any Arminian at this day believe this, or can he name any Arminian that doth avouch this? Nay doth himſelfe believe this? If he doth not, if he cannot ſhew any Arminian that doth, with what face can he charge this opinion upon us, as if we ſhould extend the obligation to believe, much farther then the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians doe, whereas uſually they criminate us, for not extending it ſo farre as we ſhould. And indeed there is a main difference between theſe benefits and the former: For as touching the former, namely pardon of ſinne and ſalvation, God doth not uſe to conferre them, but conditionally, to wit, upon the condition of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But as for faith and repentance, doth God conferre them conditionally alſo? If ſo, then let them make known to us, what that condition is on mans part, and whatſoever it be, let them look unto it, how they can avoid the making of grace, to wit, the grace of faith and repentance, to be given according unto works. But if theſe graces are conferred abſolutely, and Chriſt dyed for all to this end, that faith and repentance ſhould be conferred abſolutely upon all, then it followeth manifeſtly herehence, that all muſt believe and repent, and conſequently all muſt be ſaved. So that not only Election (as <hi>Huberus</hi> that renegate faigned) muſt be univerſall, but Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation alſo. Thus have I given in my anſwer diſtinctly, to that which he delivered moſt confuſedly. Fourthly I come to the ſcanning of the particular opinion of <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> namely, that every one that hears the Goſpell, whether elect or reprobate (for ſo I ſuppoſe it proceeds, to wit, only of them, who heare the Goſpell, though this Author, takes no conſideration of that neither, but hand-over-head, laies about him like a mad man) is bound to believe, that he is elect in Chriſt; and will trye whether I cannot reduce that opinion of his alſo, to a faire interpretation. And here firſt I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, <hi>Zanchy</hi> is not charged to maintain, that every hearer of the Goſpell, is bound to believe, that he is elect in Chriſt unto faith and repentance, but only to ſalvation: that puts me in good heart, that <hi>Zanchy</hi> &amp; I ſhall ſhake hands of fellowſhip in the end, and part good friends. Secondly, I diſtinguiſh between abſolute-Election unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and election unto Salvation-abſolute. The firſt only removes all cauſe on mans part of election, the latter removes all cauſe on mans part of ſalvation. By cauſe of ſalvation I mean only a diſpoſing cauſe, ſuch as faith, repentance, and good works are, as whereby (to expreſſe it in the Apoſtles phraſe) we are <hi>made meet partakers of the</hi> 
                                    <note place="margin">Col. 1. 12.</note> 
                                    <hi>inheritance of the Saints of light.</hi> Now albeit <hi>Zanchy</hi> maintains as we doe, that all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect are abſolutely elected unto ſalvation, there being no cauſe on mans part of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, as we have learned: yet neither <hi>Zanchy</hi> nor we doe maintain that God doth elect any unto ſalvation abſolute, that is, to bring him to ſalvation, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſing of him thereunto by faith and repentance. Now to accommodate that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Zanchy,</hi> I ſay it may have a good ſenſe, to ſay that every hearer is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, both that Chriſt dyed to procure Salvation for him, in caſe he doe believe, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56120:85"/>
that God ordained that he ſhould be ſaved, in caſe he doe believe; where beliefe is made the condition only of ſalvation, not of the Divine ordination; and the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe by the Arminians, doth uſually make them confident and inſolent, and in a word, <hi>Magnas Tragoedias excitare.</hi> But take a way the confuſion of things that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, their combes are cut, their locks are ſhorne, and they are but as another man. Now having ſhewed in what ſenſe every hearer, is bound to believe that Chriſt died for him, and in what ſenſe not, let us conſider of what worth this Authors arguments are, breathing nothing but ſmoak and fire, I will not ſay, like the great <hi>Potan,</hi> but like fell <hi>Dragon;</hi> but I nothing doubt we ſhall pare his nailes, and make him calme e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough ere we have done with him, ſo that a little child ſhall be able enough to lead him. Now that they cannot be juſtly bound to believe, if they be abſolute reprobates he takes upon him to prove by three reaſons.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. The firſt is, becauſe <hi>it is Gods will that they ſhall not believe, becauſe it is his perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will, that they ſhall have no power to believe.</hi> I anſwere, it is indeed the will of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that is, he hath decreed not to give any Reprobate a juſtifying faith, but hence it followeth not, that therefore they cannot believe thus farre the contents of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, namely, that both Chriſt hath merited, and God hath ordained, that as many as doe believe ſhall be ſaved. For this, as I take it, is not uſually accounted by our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines a juſtifying faith, but rather it comes within the compaſſe of ſuch a faith, as is commonly counted faith hiſtoricall.</p>
                                 <p>Secondly I anſwer, it followeth not, that becauſe God hath decreed to deny them the grace of faith, therefore they are not bound to believe; which I prove by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For was not <hi>Pharaoh</hi> bound to let Iſrael goe, when <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent to him from <note place="margin">Exod. 7. 2, 3.</note> the Lord, to command him in the name of the Lord, to let Iſrael goe? Yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture plainly teacheth us, that the Lord told <hi>Moſes</hi> that he would harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, and that he ſhould not let Iſrael goe. What I pray is now become of his reaſon, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the light of Scripture? And what have we to doe to enquire into Gods counſells, as whether he hath decreed to give us grace or no? Is it not enough to bind us to obedience, for God to command this or that unto us? Did <hi>Abraham</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in his thoughts, whether it were his purpoſe yea or no, that <hi>Iſaack</hi> ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed? Nothing leſſe; but upon the Lords command, he forthwith addreſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the worke, riſing early in the morning, and going forward in the Lords buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Then again, we find by common experience, that naturall men are too to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident rather, and preſumptuous of their power, then diffident, and diſtruſtfull; <hi>dicere</hi>

But if I have a debtor, whom I know to be a Bankerupt, but he knowes it not, but having many bagges of Braſſe or Copper pieces, which he takes to be Gold, conceits himſelfe able enough to pay all his debts, and more too: ſhall I be ſaid to commit any inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent thing, by urging him to pay that he oweth?

                                 <p n="3">3. Laſtly, if God cannot juſtly command, and by command bind man to obey, in caſe he hath no power to obey; in like ſort God cannot juſtly complaine of their diſobedience, who being hardned by God, cannot obey him: And indeed as this Author argueth againſt the juſtice of Gods commands in this caſe, ſo the Apoſtle brings in one arguing the injuſtice of Gods complaints in the like caſe.

The Lord tells us by his Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> that <hi>Like as a Blackamore cannot change his skinne, nor a Leopard his ſpotts, no more can they doe good, that are</hi>

                                    <hi>accuſtomed unto evill.</hi> Now if a man taken in ſtealth ſhall plead thus before a Judge, My Lord, I beſeech you have compaſſion upon me, for I have ſo long time inured my hands to pilfering, that now I cannot forbeare it: will this be accepted as a good plea to ſave him from the Gallowes. Again, it is obſerved that men are naturally prone to runne upon the committing of things forbidden them; <hi>Gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas: &amp; nitimur in vetitum:</hi> yet this is no juſt excuſe. Laſtly; as for faith, it is well known that Divines diſtinguiſh between <hi>fides acquiſita,</hi> and <hi>fides infuſa;</hi> that we may call a faith naturally acquired, which is found in carnall perſons, whether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane or Hypocriticall: and this is a faith inſpired by Gods ſpirit. The object of each is all one, and a Man may ſuffer Martyrdome for the one as well as for the other, which manifeſteth the pertinacious adherence thereunto. And it appears that all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions have had their Martyrs; <hi>Ucali Fartax</hi> a Calabrian borne, endured the Gallies fourteen years, rather then he would turne Turke; yet at length he became a Turke, and only in ſpleen to be revenged on a Turke, who had given him a boxe on the eare, and became a great man amongſt them: And at the famous battell of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone maintained his Squadron entire, and beat the Chriſtians. But to returne, albeit it be not in the power of nature to believe <hi>fide infuſâ,</hi> yet is it in the power of nature to believe the Goſpell <hi>fide acquiſitâ,</hi> which depends partly upon a mans education, and partly upon reaſon, conſidering the credibility of the Chriſtian way, by light of naturall obſervations, above all other waies in the World. And when men refuſe to embrace the Goſpell, not ſo much becauſe of the credibility of it, but becauſe it is not congruous to their naturall affections, as our Saviour tells the Jewes, <hi>Light came into the World, and men loved darkneſſe rather then light, becauſe their deeds are evill:</hi> Is there <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.</note> any reaſon why their condemnation ſhould be any whit the eaſier for this? Neither have I ever read, or heard it taught by any, that men ſhall be damned for not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>fide infuſâ,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, becauſe God hath not regenerated them; but either becauſe they have refuſed to believe, or elſe if they have embraced the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, for not living anſwerable thereunto, which alſo is in their power, <hi>quoad exterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem vitae emendationem,</hi> though it be not in their power to regenerate their wills, and change their hearts, any more then it is to illuminate their minds: yet I never read that any mans damnation, was any whit the more encreaſed for not performing theſe acts. Thus farre I have been content to expatiate in the way of reaſonable diſcourſe, to meet with this Diſputer in his own element; though every ſober Chriſtian (I ſhould think) ſhould reſt ſatisfied with the word of God, which both teacheth us that <hi>the naturall man perceiveth not the things of God, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſcerned,</hi> &amp; that <hi>all men are found dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes,</hi> before the ſpirit of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration comes, <hi>that men cannot believe,</hi> that they <hi>cannot repent,</hi> that <hi>they that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God;</hi> and that a man hardned cannot obey; and yet withall, that God doth command faith, repentance, and obedience, and complaines of default in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. And if any man charge ſuch courſes as unjuſt, what is the Apoſtles courſe in meeting with ſuch imputations, but either to ſhew, that the word attributes ſuch a courſe to God, and therefore it cannot be unjuſt, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, is there unrighteouſneſſe with God?</hi> God forbid, for <hi>he ſaith to Moſes, I will have compaſſion on him, on whom I will have compaſſion, and I will ſhew mercy on him, to whom I will ſhew mecy:</hi> or to fly to the conſideration of the Lords dominion over all, as Creator over his creatures. I come to his ſecond reaſon.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. And that is, <hi>becauſe it is impoſſible that they ſhould believe, they want power to believe, and muſt want it ſtill.

Yet adde this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, this impoſſibility is only upon ſuppoſition of Gods Decree, which nothing hinders the liberty of the creature, in doing freely what he doth, and freely leaving undone what he doth not, as appears manifeſtly by divers inſtances. For upon ſuppoſition of Gods decree, that not a bone of Chriſt ſhould be broken, it was impoſſible they ſhould be broken: yet who doubts, but that the Souldiers did as freely abſtaine from the <note place="margin">Iohn 19. 33, 36.</note> breaking of Chriſts bones, as they did freely break the others bones? And the Text notes the reaſon why they brake not Chriſts bones, to wit, becauſe they ſaw he was dead already. In like ſort upon ſuppoſition of Gods decree, that <hi>Joſiah</hi> by name ſhould burne the Prophets bones upon the Altar: <hi>Cyrus</hi> by name ſhould build him a Citty, and let goe his captives; it was impoſſible that it ſhould be otherwiſe: yet I
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56120:86"/>
think no wiſe man doubts but that <hi>Joſiah</hi> did the one, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> the other, as freely as they did any thing in their lives. And therefore this Author doth miſerably overlaſh in the element of his Philoſophy, and rationall diſcourſe, in ſaying, <hi>a man in juſtice can be tyed to believe no more, then a man can be bound to fly like a Bird, or to reach heaven with the top of his finger.</hi> He might as well ſay, that becauſe God had determined that the Souldiers ſhould not breake Chriſts bones, therefore they had no more power to breake Chriſts bones, then they had power <hi>to fly like a Bird, or to reach Heaven with the top of their finger.</hi> Certainly there is no man but by grace may be enabled to believe: but never was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man known to affirme, that by grace a man may be enabled to fly like a Bird, or to reach Heaven with the top of his finger. If this be not miſerably to over-reach, I know not what is. As for his rule, <hi>Nemo obligatur ad impoſſibile,</hi> judge I pray of the truth of it by this; What if a man by a vitious converſation, hath made it as impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to doe good, as it is impoſſible for a Blackemore to change his skinne, or <note place="margin">

And as by our own ſinnes committed by our perſons, ſo by the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> which was the ſinne of our nature, upon the whole nature of man was this impotency brought, as the Scriptures teach, and none that I know were known in the dayes of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> to deny, but the <hi>Plagians.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>I come to the Third.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. Now this depends upon a notorious confuſion of things that differ. For I have ſhewed, how the Lord hath given them a ſufficient object of that faith, which he requires of them, as touching <hi>Chriſts</hi> dyeing for them; namily, to believe that Chriſt hath merited the pardon of ſinne, and ſalvation for as many as believe in him, in ſuch ſort, that if all, and every one throughout the World ſhould believe in him; they ſhould be ſaved by him. And this depends meerely upon the ſufficiency of Chriſts merits, and undoubtedly it was the will of God, that Chriſts merits ſhould be of ſuch a value, as was ſufficient for the ſalvation of all, and every one: otherwiſe it were not true, that if all and every one ſhould believe in Chriſt, they ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the vertue of Chriſt merits. But as for any obligation to believe that Chriſt died to procure faith and repentance for all and every one; I never yet heard or read of any Arminian, that he believed it. Nay in their <hi>Apologia Remonſtrantium,</hi> or <hi>Cenſura Cenſurae,</hi> they plainly profeſſe, that Chriſt died not at all to merit faith, and regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for any. In like ſort it is not credible to me, that any Arminian believes, that Chriſt dyed for any ſo, as to procure pardon of ſinne and ſalvation abſolutely for him, whether he believe or no, provided that he live to be capable of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and to enjoy the Goſpell, and the Preaching of Chriſt crucified. And like as it is no lye, but truth, that Chriſt dyed to procure ſalvation, to as many as believe in him, ſo in being obliged to believe this, or puniſhed for not believing it, is neither to be obliged to the believing of a lye, nor puniſhed for not believing it. Therefore it is falſe to ſay there is no ſuch matter. For look in what ſenſe they are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Chriſt died for them, in the ſame ſenſe it is moſt true, that Chriſt died for them; they are bound to believe that Chriſt dyed to procure ſalvation for every one that believeth: and it is moſt true, that in like manner, Chriſt hath procured the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of every one that believes: ſo that here is a truth to feed upon, and they that oppoſe it, are ſtrengthned in their vaine confidence by a meere miſt of confuſion, which they raiſe unto themſelves and others, that ſo they may ſet the better face up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that lye, which they hold in their right hand, wherewith they are ſo enamoured that they had rather forſake their own mercies, then forgoe it. And ſo I come to the third and laſt reaſon in generall drawn from Gods juſtice.</p>

                              <p>THe third reaſon why abſolute Reprobation infringeth Gods juſtice is, becauſe it will have him to puniſh men for the omiſſion of an act, which is made impoſſible unto them by his own decree, not by that decree alone whereby he determined to give them no power to believe, having loſt it, but by that decree alſo, by which he purpoſeth that we ſhould partake with <hi>Adam</hi> in his ſinne, and be ſtripped of all that ſupernaturall power, which we had by Gods free grant, beſtowed upon us in Adam before the fall: Theſe are my reaſons which move me to think, that this abſolute decree is repugnant to Gods juſtice.</p>

                                 <p>I Have already ſhewed how Gods decree and impoſſibility ariſing upon ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, doth no way prejudice the liberty of the creature, as by pregnant paſſages of the Scripture is made plaine unto us. And as for the other decree here ſpoken of; Firſt it is untrue which he ſuppoſeth, that, God by a ſpeciall decree decreed all mankind to be made partakers of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, and therein to be ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of all ſupernaturall power, which before the had by Gods free grant. For if it were juſt with God to decree, that <hi>Adams</hi> nature, upon his ſinning, ſhould be berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all ſupernaturall power, which formerly he enjoyed, this and this alone ſhould ſuffice to bereave all his poſterity of ſupernaturall power to doe that which is good. For ſeeing all his poſterity did receive their natures from <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, they muſt therewithall neceſſarily receive their natures from him, bereaved of all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall power unto that which is good, untill ſuch time, as God be pleaſed of his free grace to reſtore it by regeneration. 2.

                              <p>TWo things are uſually anſwered. Firſt, that there are many things delivered for truths in Scripture, (among which this is one) which are above the reach of humane capacity, and therefore are we quietly to ſubmit, as to other revealed truths, ſo to this, and not to be ſo bold as to examine the juſtice of this decree, or any thing elſe in it, by our ſhallow and erring underſtandings. But this anſwer takes not away the arguments, for I have theſe things to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. That though there be diverſe things revealed in Gods word, which are above reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That there are three Perſons and one God; and that Chriſt was borne of a Virgin; that the world was made of nothing, that the dead ſhall be raiſed, &amp;c. to all which we muſt captivate our underſtandings, and yeeld a firme aſſent <hi>propter authoritatem dicentis:</hi> yet there is nothing revealed therein, abhorring from, and odious to ſound and right reaſon; for it cannot be, that the moſt excellent gifts of God, Faith and Reaſon, Nature and Scripture ſhould overthrow one another: and that the wiſe God, who is the fountain of all right reaſon, ſhould diſcover any thing to us in his word, or enjoyne us any thing to be believed, which is <hi>vere</hi>

                              <p n="2">2. That therefore all thoſe Doctrines which are adverſe and repugnant to underſtandings, purged from prejudice and falſe principles, are not to be taken for doctrines of Scripture, but devices of men corrupting Scripture by falſe gloſſes and interpretations, and conſequently, that this abſolute repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of ſo many millions of miſerable men, out of Gods only will and pleaſure, becauſe it is moſt irkeſome to the eares and underſtandings of all ſorts of men beſt and worſt, that ſtand indifferent to the entertainment of any truths, that may appeare to be ſo, is no doctrine of the Text, no part of the word of God.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. That howbeit ſome things in Scripture, which are peculiar to the Goſpell, are above our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and muſt without heſitation be believed, yet there are many things there, which have their foundation in nature, and may be apprehended by the light of nature, and demonſtrated by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and among theſe things the juſtice of Gods waies is one, as I have ſhewed before out of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 5. 3. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. and it is but a meer evaſion, when the abſolute decree is proved by ſound reaſons to be unjuſt, to ſay, reaſon is blind, and muſt not be judge, but the Scripture only: for God offers the juſtice of his waies to the tryall of reaſon.</p>

For his reaſons like ſome hobgoblins, doe ſo fright them, more then all the ſpirits that ſtand by the naked man in the book of Moones: And therefore all the help they have, if we believe this <hi>Pyrgopolinices</hi> is to charme them, by ſaying, that <hi>many things are delivered in Scripture, which are above the reach of humane capacity, among which this is one, &amp;c.</hi> And I take this to be ſound.

as great an Anakim as this Author, or his familiar ſpirit takes himſelfe to be, ſpares not to profeſſe, that about the reconciling of Gods predeſtination with the liberty of mans will (a poynt that comes ſo neere to this in hand as a poynt can doe) there are many diſtinctions deviſed by the learned, but yet he ſaith of them, that they did not <hi>qutetare intellectum,</hi> and therefore that he did <hi>captivare ſuum in obſequium fidei:</hi> and <hi>Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi> no dwarfe neither in Scholaſticall, that is, rationall Divinity, addeth that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Cajetan piiſſimè &amp; doctiſſimè loquitur.</hi> But who they are, that have taken notice, of thoſe arguments here ſpecified, and at the ſight of them were ſo ſton'd, as at the ſight of ſome <hi>Meduſas</hi> head, and thereupon came to this courſe of incantation or pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, he doth very wiſely conceale, and like a man of authority, puts it upon us to take it upon his word. Yet I doe not remember that I have reſted my ſelfe upon any ſuch courſe, though the holy Apoſtle thinks it ſufficient to cleare any courſe of God from injuſtice, by proving that Scripture doth attribute ſuch a courſe unto God, as I have ſhewed out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 14. It is true, the ſpirit which this Author breaths, is the right Pelagian ſpirit, according to the Pelagians in <hi>Bradwardines</hi> daies: for their vaunt was, that they could not be refuted by any reaſon Philoſophicall, but only by certain naked authorities Theologicall, (as I have heard of a Schollar, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times challenged by a friend and kinſman of his, for being given (as he heard) to the Arminian Tenet, made a ready anſwer with proteſtation, that that opinion was very plauſible, but that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

This rule when we were initiates in the Univerſity, we were ſoon acquainted with: Yet this Author to vent his fulneſſe, caſts himſelfe upon an unneceſſary proofe thereof, and the miſchiefe is, that his proofe maketh his cauſe worſe then it was before.

Our ſervice of God is reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in as much as it is performed by reaſonable creatures, and the rule thereof is not <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> naturall reaſon, but meerely the word of God.

About <hi>Regula fidei,</hi> the rule of Faith, there is much queſtion between us and Papiſts; the meaning whereof is, what that is whereinto muſt be made the laſt reſolution of our Faith? We ſay it is the word of God contained in the Books of the Old Teſtament and the New; Papiſts ſay, it is the voyce of the Church. This Author deviſeth a new way, which I think was never heard off before, except among the Socinians, namely, that it is <hi>the judgement of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings purged from prejudice and falſe Principles.</hi> For albeit the Doctrine of Faith, we judge to be contained no where, but in Gods word, yet notwithſtanding as touching the meaning of it, nothing muſt be taken to be the true meaning of Scripture, how fairely ſoever grounded thereupon in ſhew, unleſſe withall it ſeem nothing repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to <hi>underſtandings purged from prejudice and falſe principles.</hi> Into this therefore muſt be made the laſt reſolution of our faith.</p>
                                 <p>Again, where ſhall we meet with theſe judges as they are here deſcribed, to wit, as <hi>having their underſtandings purged from prejudice and falſe principles:</hi> undoubtedly, like as the Church of Rome, when they have once brought the matter hitherto, that the laſt reſolution of faith, muſt be made into the voyce of the Church, are confident enough, that when the queſtion is made of the voyce of the Church, where that is to be found, they ſhall undoubtedly be able to carry it for the Church of Rome: So theſe Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, or Socinians rather, when they have once brought the matter to this paſſe, that the laſt reſolution of our faith muſt be made into the judgement of mens <hi>underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings purged from prejudice and falſe principles;</hi> and that the queſtion beginneth to be made of underſtandings thus purified, where they are to be found, they will be ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to themſelves, as to conceive, that ſuch underſtandings are to be found no where, but amongſt the nation of the Arminians; or at leaſt among ſuch, whoſe judgements are naturally inclined towards their Tenets. But is this a decent courſe to reſt in the judgement of any mans underſtanding, whereas the ſoundnes of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is not, nor cannot be diſcerned, but by the ſtrength of his argument: and again, conſidering the judgement of man is miſerably corrupted in ſuch ſort, as that <hi>the things of God ſeem fooliſhneſſe unto them,</hi> Is it not much fitter that we ſhould judge of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans underſtanding by Gods word, which cannot erre, rather then judge of the meaning of the word by the underſtanding of man? Let any man uſe his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in opening and interpreting the word of God unto us, and clearing the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof unto us as much as he can, by reaſon, by argument, by demonſtration, but ſtill let it be indifferent for any to judge, in what congruity his interpretation ſtands with the Text it ſelfe, and no mans judgement to be a rule of Faith unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                                 <p>Before he goes off from this, he gives another deſcription of thoſe, whoſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt be the rule of the right interpretation of Scripture; to wit, ſuch as <hi>ſtand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to the entertainment of any truths.</hi> Now this ſeems to me to be as poore as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or rather much poorer. For this indifferency as I take it, is in reſpect of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; now albeit a man may be thus diſpoſed, in reſpect of his affections, yet he may be of a very weak judgement; as for example, I have heard of a good man, that was ſometimes wavering about the poynt of Ceremonies, yet very willing to receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; and therefore conferres with both ſides, as well ſuch as held them law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the uſe, as with thoſe that held them unlawfull, and ſtill was carried every way with the force of their reaſons, who conferred with him for the preſent. Then again, ſuppoſe the indifferent were moſt fit to judge, where ſhall we find thoſe indifferent perſons, or who ſhall give rules, and what rules, according whereto to proceed in this our inquiſition? Again, who are to be preſuppoſed in likelihood, to be the more indifferent, then ſuch as have not hitherto been verſed in theſe controverſies, and is it fit, that they who have been many years verſed in them, ſhould ſtand to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56120:89"/>
of thoſe who are little or nothing exerciſed therein? Laſtly is the creature fit to judge of the Soveraignty of his creator, or being conceived of the freedome of his own will, to judge how farre it is reaſonable, God ſhould have power over his will and no farther? When the Apoſtle calls upon the Corinthians, to judge whether that which he wrote unto them, were the commandements of God or no, whom doth he call unto this office? Doth he call any other but ſuch as are ſpirituall? <hi>If there be any amongſt you that is a Prophet, or ſpirituall, let him know that theſe things are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. He doth not ſay, if there be any amongſt you, that hath his underſtanding purged from prejudice, and falſe principles, let him know that theſe things which I write unto you, are the commandements of God. And the ſame Apoſtle tells us, that the <hi>things of God are ſpiritually to be diſcerned.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
                                 <p>Yet it is remarkable, that he appeals to the judgement not of the beſt only, but the worſt alſo in this: but ſomething qualified I confeſſe, to wit, provided that they <hi>ſtand indifferent to the entertainment of any truths.</hi> Marke it well, <hi>of any truths:</hi> and who are theſe? Not poſſeſſed with the entertainment of any Truths, but indifferent to the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, I ſay who are theſe? The regenerate or unregenerate? Here I am at a ſtand, not knowing which way to take. But it may be this is ſpoken only in reference to our Doctrine of abſolute Reprobation. But of whatſoever it be ſpoken, let him give inſtance in either or in both; it ſeems he is indifferent to have it take place either way, for he propoſed it of beſt and worſt. But why ſhould he preſuppoſe an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man to be indifferent, to the entertainment of any truth? Whereas the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle profeſſeth of a naturall man, that he cannot know the things of God, and he gives the reaſon of it, becauſe <hi>they are ſpiritually diſcerned;</hi> and formerly ſaid that they were <hi>fooliſhneſſe unto him.</hi> Yet I willingly confeſſe, the Doctrine of abſolute Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is very harſh to the judgement and affections of carnall men; and ſuch as we had never embraced, had it not been for the word of God, which plainly profeſſeth, that <hi>election is not of</hi> (good) <hi>works;</hi> and that by ſuch an argument, as whereby it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 11.</note> 1. That election is as well proved not to be of faith, as not of works. 2. That reprobation is not of evill works; yet the harſhneſſe hereof, is nothing like ſo much appearing in its proper colours, as upon their deciphering and blazing of it, who are as zealous for making election to be upon foreſight of faith and works (though this latter member, they are loath to have the World take notice of) as they are oppoſite to the abſoluteneſſe of reprobation. Now whereas before I have ſhewed, that there is a great deale of difference between abſolute election unto ſalvation, and election unto ſalvation abſolute: And that not one of our Divines doth maintain, that God doth elect men unto ſalvation abſolute, but to obtain ſalvation upon their faith and repentance, and finall perſeverance therein: In like ſort there is as great difference between abſolute reprobation unto damnation, and reprobation unto damnation ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute. And if none of our Divines doe maintain, that God ordains any man of ripe years to obtain ſalvation, otherwiſe then upon their faith and repentance, and finall perſeverance: how much leſſe doe they maintain, that God ordains any man unto damnation, otherwiſe then for his ſinne and finall perſeverance therein without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? Whereas theſe enemies of the grace of God, as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſometimes called the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> to make their cauſe more plauſible to the affections or carnall men carry the matter ſo, as if we maintained that God ordained them to be damned abſolutely, and for the meer pleaſure of God, concealing the only cauſe for which God ordained, that they ſhould be damned, namely, for the wilfull tranſgreſſion of Gods holy Commandements. Only the giving and denying of the grace of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the giving of faith and repentance, for the curing of that naturall infidelity and impenitency that is found in all; and the leaving it uncured by denying faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: this indeed we maintain to be abſolute, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. Now, dare any of them deny faith and repentance to be the gift of God? They doe not, they dare not; only of late they have come thus farre, as to deny that Chriſt merited faith and regeneration for any. Secondly, inquire whether God gives faith and repentance to ſome, and denyes it to others of his meere will and pleaſure, or becauſe he finds ſome good works in the one, which he finds not in the other. Here is the criticall poynt, we defend no other abſoluteneſſe of election and reprobation, but ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends wholly on this, namely, that God finding men equall in corruption, hath compaſſion on ſome, giving them faith and repentance, which he denies unto others:
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56120:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
All other abſoluteneſſe of Election and Reprobation, beſides that which we undertake by cleare demonſtration to deduce herehence, we utterly renounce. Neither can our adverſaries be ſo groſſely ignorant, as not to perceive that this is the criticall poynt of theſe controverſies, the reſolution of the truths wherein, will ſet an end to all conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about Election and Reprobation. Why then doe they not deale plainly, and try their ſtrength in this, whereby they ſhould carry themſelves fairely and ingenuouſly, and deale above board. For here alone is that abſoluteneſſe of God in execution, which we maintaine; but here they are not ſo prone to ſhew their hornes: this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not ſo fit for the raiſing of clamours and Tragedies. And hating the truth of God as touching his ſoveraignty over his creatures, to have compaſſion on whom he will, and to harden whom he will; as alſo the prerogatives of his grace, to work us effectually to that which is pleaſing in his fight, and that in whom he will alſo: yet not daring plainly to deliver their mind in this, as wherein they are found moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and encumbred with ſhamefull contradictions; therefore by the back dore as it were, they hope to diſcredit it, and by oppoſing the abſoluteneſſe of Reprobation, to ſupplant and undermine the Doctrine of Gods free grace. And not content with this, they miſerably corrupt our doctrine alſo, in the poynt of abſolute Reprobation, drawing it to this; as if not reprobation only, but damnation alſo were made abſolute by us: and that God damned men not ſo much in the way of juſtice for their ſinne, as of his own meere pleaſure. At length to come to the third particular of his reply.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. And that is this, <hi>that howbeit ſome things in Scripture, which are peculiar to the Goſpell, are above our underſtandings, and muſt without heſitation be believed: yet many things there, have their foundation in nature, and may be apprehended by the light of nature; and amongſt theſe, the juſtice of Gods waies is one, as hath been ſhewed. Iſai</hi> 5. 3. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. To this I anſwer, That the waies of God mentioned <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5. 3. is only in his expecting fruits after ſo great pains that he had taken, in husbanding his vineyard. And <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. conſiſts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in rendring unto men according to their waies. Neither doth it follow, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the juſtice of God doth plainly appeare in theſe particulars, therefore it doth appeare as cleerely, or comprehenſively in all others. Is there no difference between the waies of God there mentioned, and the waies of Gods juſtice mentioned in other place; as namely, in cauſing the Sonnes of <hi>Achan</hi> to be ſtoned to death with <hi>Achan</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for his Sacriledge: in drowning the old World, not ſparing the very Infants and ſucklings: and for their conſpiracy againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> cauſing the earth to ſwallow up not <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> only, but their Wives and Children, and all that they had? So in conſuming <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> with fire. And as for the puniſhing of of ſinne, this is no peculiar truth of the Goſpell. I had thought the Goſpell, in the proper nature thereof, had been above reaſon altogether, and no way capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration. And as for the juſtice of God, muſt not this ſuppoſe him to be a free a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent? Or was this known to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> by all the light of nature whereunto he attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? We that believe him to be a free agent, and withall the creator of all, are ready to demonſtrate, that it is in his power to doe what he will with his creature, and that not only to annihilate him, though never ſo holy, but to inflict what paine ſoever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, yea even the torment of hell fire; which <hi>Medina</hi> acknowledgeth to have been <hi>Communem omnium Theologorum ſententiam, viz.</hi> that this he can doe, <hi>ut Dominus vitae &amp; mortis;</hi> as I have ſhewed in my <hi>Vindiciae graciae Dei,</hi> and by variety of arguments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, more then once in two ſeverall digreſſions, which this Author pretends to have ſeen, yet anſwereth not one of them. And as for juſtice divine toward the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (whereupon this Author doth with ſuch confidence diſcourſe,) both <hi>Vaſquez</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> Jeſuits, in other poynts concerning Gods juſtice, are miſerably at odds, yet joyntly concurre in this, that all iuſtice Divine, doth preſuppoſe the free determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods will: Now, becauſe I find this Gentleman, ſo conceited of the purity of his rationall faculty, and the power thereof, as to require that all interpretation of Scripture, ſhould veyle bonnet to the ſoveraignty thereof; I purpoſe to try his ability this way, for the expediting of certain arguments about the abſoluteneſſe of Gods decrees in generall, and particularly of the decree of Reprobation. Therefore to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with him on his own ground, and in his own element, I diſpute thus.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. No temporall thing can be the cauſe of that which is eternall, but the ſinnes of men are all temporall, whereas Reprobation is eternall, therefore the ſinnes of men cannot be the cauſe of Reprobation.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="164" facs="tcp:56120:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
If it be ſaid, that ſinne is not made the cauſe of reprobation, but as it exſiſts in Gods foreſight, and ſo not ſo much ſinne as the preſcience of ſinne is the cauſe of reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I reply, that this device cannot ſtand, <hi>viz.</hi> that the preſcience of ſinne ſhould be the cauſe of reprobation, and that for this reaſon; The cauſe of reprobation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we enquire, is of the nature of a meritorious cauſe, But the preſcience of God can no way be ſaid to be a meritorious cauſe thereof. Science and preſcience are cauſes of Gods works in the kind of an efficient Phyſicall, not in the kind of an efficient morall, ſuch as are all cauſes meritorious.</p>
                                 <p>If it be farther ſaid, that not ſo much the foreſight of ſin, as (to ſpeak more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) ſinne foreſeen is the cauſe of reprobation: I reply againſt it in this manner; ſinne foreſeen doth ſuppoſe <hi>Gods</hi> decree to permit ſinne, and conſequently if ſinne foreſeene be before reprobation, then alſo the decree of permitting ſinne is before the decree of reprobation, that is, the decree of damning for ſinne. But this cannot be, as I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove by two reaſons. The firſt is this; There is no order in intentions, but between the intention of the end and the intention of the means, and the order is this, that the intention of the end is before the intention of the means. Therefore if the decree of permitting ſinne be before the decree of damning for ſinne, the decree of permitting ſinne muſt be the intention of the end, and the decree of damning for ſinne muſt be the intention of the meanes. But this is notoriouſly untrue: For it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that damnation tends not to the permiſſion of ſinne, as the end thereof; for if it did then men were damned to this end, that they might be permitted to ſinne. But far more likely it is, that ſinne ſhould be permitted to this end, that a man might be damned, which yet by no means doe I a vouch; other reaſons I have, to ſhew the vanity of this argumentation. I rather profeſſe, that permſſion of ſinne and damnation are not ſubordinate as end &amp; means, but coordinate, both being means tending joyntly to a farther end, which, under correction from underſtandings purged from prejudice and falſe principles, I take to be the manifeſtation of Gods glory in the way of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice vindicative.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. My ſecond reaſon is, if permiſſion of ſinne be firſt in intention and then dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it followes that permiſſion of ſinne ſhould be laſt in execution; but this is moſt abſurd, namely, that a man ſhould be firſt damned, and then ſuffered to ſinne.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. My ſecond principall argument is this; Reprobation, as it ſignifies Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, is the act of Gods will; now the act of Gods will is the very will of God, and the will of God is Gods eſſence, and like as there can be no cauſe of Gods eſſence, ſo there can be no cauſe of Gods will, or of the act thereof. Upon ſome ſuch arguments as theſe, <hi>Aquinas</hi> diſputes, that the predeſtination of Chriſt, cannot be the cauſe of our Predeſtination; adding that they are one act in God. And when he comes to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the queſtion, he grants all as touching <hi>actum volentis,</hi> that the one cannot be the cauſe of the other; But only <hi>quoad praedeſtinationis terminum,</hi> which is grace and glory, or the things predeſtinated. Chriſt is the cauſe of them, but not of our prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, as touching the act of God predeſtinating. And I think I may be bold to preſume, that Chriſts merits are of as great force to be the cauſe, why God ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect man unto ſalvation; as mans ſinnes are of force, to be the cauſe why God ſhould reprobate him unto damnation. The ſame <hi>Aquinas</hi> (a tall fellow as touching Scolaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call argumentation) hath profeſſed that <hi>no man hath been ſo mad as to ſay that merits are the cauſe of predeſtination, quoad actum praedeſtinantis;</hi> and why, but becauſe there can be no cauſe on mans part of the will of God <hi>quoad actum volentis.</hi> Now reprobation is well knowne to be the will of God as well as election; and therefore no cauſe can there be on mans part thereof <hi>quoad actum reprobantis.</hi> And it is well knowne, there is a predeſtination unto death, as well as unto life, and conſequently tis as mad a thing in his judgement to maintaine, that merits are the cauſe there of <hi>quoad actum praedeſtinantis</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>God by efficacious grace could breake off any mans infidelity if it pleaſed him, that is, by affording him ſuch a motion unto faith, as he foreſaw would be yeelded unto: this is eaſily proved by the evident confeſſion of <hi>Arminius</hi> formerly ſpecified. Now, Why doth <hi>God</hi> ſo order it, as to move ſome in ſuch a manner, as he foreſees they will believe; others in ſuch a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner as he foreſees they will not believe? but becauſe his purpoſe is to manifeſt the glory of his grace in the ſalvation of the one, and the glory of his juſtice in the damnation of the other. Herein I appeale to the judgement and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56120:90"/>
conſcience of every reaſonable creature that underſtands it, in ſpight of all prejudice and falſe principles to corrupt him.</p>
                                 <p n="4">4. In ſaying ſinne foreſeen is the cauſe of Gods decree of damnation, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe a preſcience of ſinne, as of a thing future, without all ground. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be foreknown as future, unleſſe it be future: now theſe diſputers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe a futurition of ſinne, and that from eternity, without all ground. For conſider, no ſinne is future in its own nature, for in its own nature it is meerely poſſible and indifferent, as well not to be future, as to become future; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot paſſe out of the condition of a thing meerely poſſible, into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a thing future without a cauſe. Now what cauſe doe theſe men deviſe of the futurition of ſinne? <hi>Extra Deum,</hi> nothing can be the cauſe thereof: For this paſſage of things out of the condition of things poſſible, into the condition of things future, was from everlaſting, for from everlaſting they were future; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, God could not have known them from everlaſting, And conſequently the cauſe of this paſſage, muſt be acknowledged to have been from everlaſting, and conſequently nothing without God could be the cauſe of it, ſeeing nothing without God was from everlaſting. Therefore the cauſe hereof muſt be found <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Deum,</hi> within God; then either the will of God, which theſe men doe utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſclaime, or the knowledge of God; but that is confeſſed to preſuppoſe things future, rather then to make them ſo; or the eſſence of God; now that may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered either as working neceſſarily, (and if in that manner it were the cauſe of things future, then all ſuch things ſhould become future by neceſſity of nature, which to ſay is Atheiſticall) or as working freely; and this is to grant, that the will of God is the cauſe why every thing meerely poſſible in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth paſſe from everlaſting into the condition of a thing future, if ſo be it were future at all. And indeed ſeeing no other cauſe can be pitched upon, this free will of God muſt be acknowledged to be the cauſe of it: And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the reaſon why every thing becomes future is, becauſe God hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it ſhall come to paſſe; but with this difference, All good things God hath determined ſhall come to paſſe by his effection, All evill things God hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſhall come to paſſe by his permiſſion. And the Scripture naturally affords plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full teſtimony to confirme this, without forcing it to interpretations congruous here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, upon preſumptuous grounds that theſe arguments proceed from underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings purged from prejudice and falſe principles.</p>
                                 <p n="5">5. My fifth argument is this. If ſinne be the cauſe of Reprobation, that is, of the decree of damnation, then either by neceſſity of nature, or by the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God; not by neceſſity of nature, as all, that hitherto I have known confeſſe. But I ſay neither can it be by the free conſtitution of God; for mark what a notorious abſurdity followeth hence, and that unavoidably, namely, <hi>that God did ordaine, that upon foreſight of ſinne, he would ordaine them to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> marke it well, <hi>God did ordaine that he would ordaine, or God did decree that he would decree.</hi> In which words Gods eternall decree is made the object of Gods decree. Whereas it is well known that the objects of Gods decrees are meerely things tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and cannot be things eternall: we truly ſay God did decree to create the World, to preſerve the World, to redeeme us, call us, juſtify us, ſanctify and ſave us, but it cannot be truly ſaid, that God did decree to decree, or ordaine to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine: for to decree is the act of Gods will, and therefore it cannot be the object of the act of Gods will. Yet theſe arguments I am not ſo enamoured with, as to force the interpretations of Scripture to ſuch a ſenſe, as is ſutable hereunto, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming of the purity of my underſtanding, as purged from prejudice and falſe principles. I could willingly content my ſelfe with obſervation of the Apoſtles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, in arguing to this effect; <hi>Before the Children were borne, or had done good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, it was ſaid the elder ſhall ſerve the younger: therefore the purpoſe of God according to electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

                                    <hi>ſtands not of works.</hi> In like manner may I diſcourſe: <hi>Before the Children were borne or had done good or evill, it was ſaid the elder ſhall ſerve the younger: therefore the purpoſe of God concerning Reprobation stands not of works.</hi> And like as hence it is inferred, that therefore election ſtands not of good works; ſo therehence may I inferre, that therefore repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation ſtands not of evill works.</p>
                                 <p n="6">6. If ſinne foreſeen be the cauſe meritorious of reprobation, then faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and good workes are the diſpoſing cauſes unto election. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56120:91"/>
evill works foreſeen are made the meritorious cauſe of reprobation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe evill works exſiſtent, are the meritorious cauſe of damnation. And if this be true, then alſo becauſe Faith and Repentance and good workes, are the diſpoſing cauſes unto ſalvation, then by the ſame force of reaſon, faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and good workes foreſeen, muſt be the diſpoſing cauſe unto election; But faith, repentance, and good workes foreſeen, are not the diſpoſing cauſes unto election; as I prove thus.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. If they were then the purpoſe of God according to election, ſhould be of faith, repentance, and good works, which is expreſſely denyed by the Apoſtle, as touching the laſt part; and may as evidently be proved <hi>to be denied by him</hi> in effect of the other parts alſo, by the ſame force of argumentation which he uſeth: as for example, from this anticedent of the Apoſtles, <hi>before the Children were borne, or had done good or evill,</hi> it no more evidently followeth that therefore the purpoſe of God according to election is not of workes, than it followeth that the ſame purpoſe of God according to election is not of faith, nor of repentance: For before they were borne they were no more capable of faith, or of repentance, than of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good works. And undoubtedly faith and repentance are as good works, as any other.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. If God doth abſolutely work faith in ſome, and not in others according to the meer pleaſure of his will, then it cannot be ſaid, that faith foreſeen, is the cauſe of any mans election. For in this caſe faith is rather the means of ſalvation, then ſalvation a means of faith; and conſequently, the intention of ſalvation ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precedes the intention of faith, than the intention of faith can be ſaid to precede the intention of ſalvation. And to this the Scripture accords, <hi>Acts</hi> 1348. <hi>As many believed as were ordained to everlaſting life,</hi> making ordination to everlaſting life the cauſe why men believed; anſwerable hereunto is that <hi>Acts</hi> 2. laſt. <hi>God added daily to the Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved:</hi> and that of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus, according to the faith of Gods elect:</hi> So that according to <hi>Pauls</hi> phraſe <hi>fides eſt electorum,</hi> but according to the Arminians Doctrine the inverſe hereof is a more proper and naturall predication, as to ſay, <hi>electio eſt fidelium.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>But God doth abſolutely work faith in ſome men, according to the meer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his will, denying the ſame grace to others: which I prove;</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. By Scripture. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. <hi>God hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth,</hi> compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 30. <hi>Yee in times paſt have not believed, but now have obtained mercy;</hi> where it appears by the Antitheſis, that to find mercy is to believe, that is, to obtain the grace of faith at the hands of God, in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> phraſe.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. By cleare reaſon: for if it be not the meer pleaſure of Gods will, that is the cauſe hereof, then the cauſe hereof muſt be ſome good workes, which he finds in ſome, and not in others; whence it manifeſtly followeth, that God giveth grace ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto works, which in the phraſe of the ancients is according to merits: and for 1200 years together, this hath been reputed in the Church of God meere Pelagianiſme.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. I further demand, what that good worke is, whereupon God workes it in one, when he refuſeth to worke it in another? Here the anſwer I find given is this, that God doth work in man <gap reason="foreign">

                                    <hi>velle credere modo velit.</hi> Now of the abſurdity hereof, I appeale to the very light of nature, and let all the books that ever were written on this argument be ſearched, and let it be enquired, whether ever any did expreſſe themſelves in the manner of ſo palpable and groſſe abſurdity: as wherein the act of willing is made the condition of it ſelfe: whence it followeth evidently, that it muſt be both before it ſelfe, and after it ſelfe; for the condition muſt all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies exſiſt before the thing conditionated. Yet they are driven upon theſe rocks of abſurdities in ſpight of their teeth: ſo ſhamefull is the iſſue of their diſcourſes, who, in hatred of Gods truth revealed in Gods word, and in a proud conceit of their own performances in the way of argumentation, dare preſcribe rules to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, how to carry themſelves in the interpretation of Scriptures; as namely, to be ſo warie, as that they doe not deliver any thing, <hi>repugnant to underſtandings purged from prejudice and falſe principles:</hi> as if the word of God ſuppoſed them that are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſtudying thereof, to have their underſtandings already purged from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and falſe principles: not that it is given by God for this very end, namely, to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56120:91"/>
purge our underſtandings: for what is the illumination or opening of the eyes of the mind, other than the purging of the underſtanding from prejudice and falſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: and how miſerable theſe aeriall diſputers doe betray themſelves, and manifeſt how they are tranſported with prejudice, and corrupted not with falſe only, but groſſe principles, by this it may appeare in part.</p>
                                 <p>I come to the conſideration of his reply to the ſecond anſwer, which here he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents.</p>

                              <p>SEcondly it is anſwered, that God is not bound to reſtore men power to believe, becauſe they once had it, and have loſt it through their own fault; as a Maſter is not bound to renew his Servants ſtock, if he have waſted it by his bad husbandry.</p>
                              <p>But this anſwer doth yet ſatisfy me as little as the former: for I grant that God is ſimply and abſolutely bound to no man, he is <hi>agens liberrimum,</hi> a moſt free diſpenſer of his own favours, both what he will, and to whom he will; but yet he is conditionally; <hi>determinavit ſeipſum,</hi> he hath bound himſelfe to give ſupernaturall abilities to men by three things.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Firſt <hi>Decernendo,</hi> the Almighty is eternally ſubject to his own decree, or elſe he would be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; and therefore what gifts ſoever he hath decreed to men, he is bound to give them by vertue of his decree.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. Secondly <hi>Promittendo.</hi> We uſe to ſay promiſe is debt, it is juſtice to performe what it was free to promiſe; and whoſoever he be that promiſeth, and payeth not, is guilty of a treſpaſſe (witneſſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi> and <hi>Saphira)</hi> and unworthy of the Kingdome of Heaven. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 4. If therefore God hath made a promiſe of any gift or grace to men, this promiſe binds him to performance.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. Thirdly <hi>Legem ferendo.</hi> By giving men a Law to keepe, which without ſupernaturall power, they cannot keep any more than they can eat a rock. By ſuch a Law the Almighty lawgiver binds himſelfe to his creatures, to give them ſuch power as may enable them to keep that law, or elſe he becomes the true and proper cauſe of the tranſgreſſion of it. We ſhall find God evermore giving ſtrength, when he giveth a command: when he commanded the creatures to encreaſe and multiply, he gave them a multiplying vertue. when Chriſt bid the lame man ariſe, take up his bed, and walke, he puts into his limbs an ability of walking: when <hi>Adam</hi> had a ſpirituall law given him to obey, which without ſpirituall ſtrength he could not, God gave him ſtrength anſwerable to the law, as all Divines agree, conſenting to that noted ſpeech of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> had <hi>poſſe non cadere,</hi> though he never had <hi>non poſſe cadere;</hi> a power and poſſibility, though not a neceſſity of continuing in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. That I may bring this home to my purpoſe. I ſay that God is bound to reſtore unto men, power to believe, ſuppoſing theſe waies that follow.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. That he hath vouchſafed to enter into a New Covenant of Peace with men, when he needed not. 2. That in that Covenant he requireth obedience at mens hands, even at theirs that periſh. 3. That he promiſeth eternall life to every man, if he obey and keep the Covenant. 4. That he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth the diſobedient with everlaſting death. Theſe particulars ſuppoſed, the moſt free God who is neceſſarily bound to none, is engaged to give ability of believing to men; nor can he juſtly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this gift, puniſh the diſobedient any more, then a Magiſtrate having put out a mans eyes for an offence, can command this man with juſtice to read a book, and becauſe he reads not, put him to death: Or then a Maſter (that I may returne the Simile in the anſwer) when he hath taken away from his Servant the ſtock, which he hath miſimployed, can afterward exact of him a juſt imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame ſtock, and puniſh him becauſe he imployeth it not. I conclude therefore, that the abſolute and inevitable reprobation of ſuch men as are called to believe in Chriſt, and puniſhed if thev believe not, is utterly repugnant to the juſtice of God, and therefore cannot be a part of his word.</p>

                                 </head>
                                 <p>THis Second anſwer is in like manner, delivered at pleaſure, without quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Author of it: And no marvaile if this Author deſires to have the making of his own bed, that he may lye the more ſoftly. Yet touching the ſimilitude here mentioned let it be ſtated aright: a Maſter truſts his ſervant with a ſtock, not to receive it from him againe, though the ſtock be of a moveable nature, but to receive from him in lieu thereof, ſome yearely emolument. In this caſe let him ſay what he can againſt it: now here his diſcourſe is for the moſt part at large, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how <hi>God,</hi> though a moſt free agent, may oblige himſelfe to his creature.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. <hi>Decremendo;</hi> whether hereby <hi>God</hi> doth bind himſelfe to his creature (which hath no being at all when <hi>Gods</hi> decrees are made) or to himſelfe rather, it is little or nothing materiall to the preſent: what ſoever it be that God decrees, we are ſure that muſt come to paſſe, provided that we doe not make his decrees of a revocable nature with ſome; but as touching any uſe of Gods obliging himſelfe this way unto his creature, this Author is content to ſay nothing at all, in the accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. <hi>Promittendo.</hi> And we willingly grant, that what God promiſeth he never failes to performe, after that manner as he hath promiſed: as namely in caſe he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that as many as believe in Chriſt ſhall be ſaved, we nothing doubt, but if all the world ſhould believe in Chriſt, all the world ſhould be ſaved. But whether any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe a promiſe concerning the giving of faith &amp; repentance unto all, &amp; every one; and that whether conditionately or abſolutely this Author is content to ſay juſt nothing. As likewiſe, neither doth he take upon him to plead any promiſe of God, to give to all and every one power to believe or power to repent.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. <hi>Legem ferendo.</hi> This alone of all the three ſerves his turne, and therefore here he doth expatiate, much more than in the former. And herehence he inferres, that God binds himſelfe to give ſupernaturall power, to keep the Law he commands, provided the Law be ſuch, as without ſupernaturall power, he can no more keepe it, than eat a rock. Now this accommodated to <hi>Adam,</hi> had need of explication, ſeeing we read of no other Law given unto him, than of abſtaining from a certain fruit: which I doe not deliver as if I doubted, but that to the performance of obedience herein, a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall power was requiſite; but only to ſignify, that it were worth the labour to give a congruous explication of it. Though of <hi>Adam</hi> I nothing doubt but he was indued with ſupernaturall power, to performe other manner of duties than this. And yet again, this denomination of power ſupernaturall, had need alſo of explication; for though that power which Adam had given him in creation, be ſupernaturall to us, yet our Divines uſually conceive it as naturall unto <hi>Adam,</hi> received together with his nature, and ſuch as ſhould have been naturall unto us all, had <hi>Adam</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in his originall integrity. But I am content to let that paſſe; only whereas he ſaith, <hi>that by ſuch a law the Allmighty law-giver binds himſelfe to his creatuees, to give them ſuch power as may enable them to keepe that law;</hi> I think rather if any obligation had place in this caſe, it were rather to maintaine the power already given them, than to give it. For every law-giver rather preſuppoſeth ability of obedience in them, to whom he gives a law; then firſt gives a law and then gives ability to performe obedience thereunto. And certainly God firſt created man after his owne image, before he gave him any law to be a rule of his obedience unto his creatour. So I take the multiplying vertue, was given to his creatures in their creation, before he ſaid <hi>encreaſe and multiply:</hi> In the curing of the lame man, his word indeed was a word of power, like as when he ſaid let there be light, and there was light. For though it goe under the forme of a command, yet it was not ſo properly a command (which is to command obedience) as the going forth of vertuous efficacy to create: like as that alſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. <hi>O ye dry bones heare the voyce of the Lord.</hi> And undoubtedly the ſtrength of obedience given unto <hi>Adam</hi> preceded Gods command, for his abſtaining from the fruit of the tree, in the midſt of the Garden. He had in his creation given
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56120:92"/>
him, <hi>poſſe non cadere,</hi> not <hi>non poſſe cadere,</hi> the event manifeſted as much: and it is as true according to the ſame <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that God gave him <hi>poſſe ſtare ſi vellet,</hi> not <hi>velle quod potuit.</hi> But that God is bound to reſtore, any ſuch power unto mankind, which they have wilfully loſt, is boldly avouched, but let us conſider how Scholaſtically it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. The firſt reaſon hereof is, becauſe <hi>God hath vouchſafed to enter into a new Covenant of Peace with men, when he needed not.</hi> To this I anſwer, that God hath entred into a new Covenant with men, is an indefinite propoſition, as touching the perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in this Covenant, and being not in a neceſſary matter but contingent, this Covenant proceeding meerely from the good pleaſure of God, it hath no more force than to ſignify, that God hath vouchſafed <hi>to enter into a new Covenant of peace with ſome men,</hi> which we wilingly grant but not with all, neither doth this propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, enforce any ſuch meaning. And that God hath not entred into a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with all, I prove by theſe reaſons.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. As many as are under the Covenant of grace, ſinne ſhall have no dominion over them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>Sinne ſhall not have the dominion over you, for you are not under the law but under grace.</hi> But ſinne hath the dominion over too many, even over the moſt part of the world, as we find by lamentable experience, therefore too many, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the moſt part of the World, are not compriſed under the Covenant of grace.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. The covenant of Grace, doth covenant on Gods part, not only to give ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon condition of faith and repentance, but for Chriſts ſake to renew mens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures alſo, and to give them faith and repentance. As appears by diverſe paſſages of Scripture: <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31. Behold the dayes come ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Judah. <hi>v.</hi> 32. Not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Covenant, that I made with their Fathers, when I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt, the which my Covenant they brake, though I was a Father unto them. But this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael, after thoſe daies ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your bodies, and will give you an heart of fleſh, and I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgements and doe them. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 23. I will ſurely rule you with a mighty hand, &amp;c. 37. And will cauſe you to paſſe under the rod, and bring you into the bond of the Covenant. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57. 18. I have ſeen his waies, and will heale him. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 5. I will heale their rebellions, I will love them freely. And that faith it ſelfe and repentance, is the gift of God, who hath taken upon him by his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, to be our Lord and our God to ſanctify us, is manifeſt by diverſe pregnant paſſages of holy Scriptures.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. I come to his ſecond reaſon. <hi>And in that Covenant he requires obedience at mens hands, even at theirs that periſh.</hi> God in his covenant of Grace requires obedience unto ſalvation, but of his free grace undertakes to regenerate them, and work them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; but how? Agreeable unto their rationall natures, that is by admonition, inſtruction, exhortation, that is to work faith and repentance, by exhorting and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them unto repentance: And becauſe this he performes by his Miniſters, to whom he hath not revealed who they are, whom he hath choſen, therefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to Preach indifferently unto all, perſwade all, exhort all, unto faith and repentance, whereof alſo he makes this uſe even towards reprobates, that whereas they are naturally confident of their ability, to doe as much as any other, and as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith <hi>dicere ſolet humana ſuperbia ſi ſciſſem, feciſſem.</hi> The Lord by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry takes from them this excuſe, ſo that unto all that heare is this truth delivered, <hi>whoſoever believeth and repenteth ſhall be ſaved:</hi> and thereupon every one is exhorted in the name of the Lord to believe and repent. But God reſolveth to worke faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in none, but thoſe whom he hath choſen, according to that <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 48. <hi>As many believed as were ordained to everlasting life.</hi> And withall the Doctrine delivered in the Goſpell is ſuch, and ſo confirmed, as may juſtly make them inexcuſable that doe not believe: when it ſhall appeare, that many a vile legend they are apt to believe, and in the mean time deſpiſe Gods holy Oracles, by divine Authority, many waies confirmed unto them.</p>
                                 <p n="3">
                                    <pb n="170" facs="tcp:56120:93"/>
3. It is moſt true, eternall life is promiſed to every on that obeyeth and keeps Covenant with God; but God over and above worketh ſome unto obedience, unto faith and repentance, beſtowing theſe gratious giftes on them, even on whom he will, when he hardeneth others even whom he will. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18.</p>
                                 <p n="4">4. <hi>He puniſheth the diſobedient with eternall death;</hi> true: but acording unto what Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant? Not according unto the Covenant of grace, that is only a Covenant for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but according unto the Covenant of the law, the Covenant of works.</p>
                                 <p>Whereas herehence this Author inferres, <hi>that the moſt free God is ingaged to give ability of believing unto men:</hi> he may as well inferre, that he is engaged to give ability unto men to the keeping of his law, and what need was there of Chriſts coming into the world? Seeing by his coming into the world, we have gained no better conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Arminian Tenet, than to be ſaved if we will; and if men have ability to to keepe the law even by the law, they may be ſaved if they will: and it will follow as well, that God, without giving this ability to keepe the law, cannot juſtly puniſh the tranſgreſſours of it; as that God without giving men ability to believe cannot puniſh men for not believing: <hi>no more than a Magiſtrate having put out a mans eyes for an offence, can command this man with juſtice to read a booke, and becauſe he reads not, put him to death.</hi> But this is a very vile ſimile, and ſtands in no tolerable proportion to that whereunto it is reſembled. For the man thus bereaved of his eyes hath a will to read, and conſequently it is no fault for not reading: for all ſinne is in the will. But it is not ſo, in not obeying either Law or Goſpell. If a man had a will to obey and believe but he could not, in ſuch a caſe it were unreaſonable he ſhould be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. But in the caſe of diſobedience unto God, we ſpeake of, all the fault is in the will voluntarily and wilfully, they neither will obey the one, nor the other: <hi>like as they that have accustomed themſelves to doe evill, can not doe good, as a blackemoore cannot change his skinne.</hi> Yet with this difference, that man is never a whit the more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, or leſſe puniſhable for not doing that which is good; not ſo the blackemore, for not changing his skinne. But ſuch is the ſhamefull iſſue of them that confound im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency Morall with impotency naturall, as if there were no difference. As wild is the compariſon following, of the Maſters exacting from his Servant a juſt employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that ſtock, which he hath taken from him. An evill ſervant may have a will to play the good husband in imploying his Maſters ſtock, where he pleaſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt him with it: But though he hath a will to be faithful and thrifty, yet without matter to worke upon, he cannot exerciſe this fidelity of his to his Maſters behoofe. Shew the like will in a carnall man to believe if he could, and if God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave him of power, in ſuch a caſe, then conclude the unreaſonableneſſe of Gods courſes herein. But if the Maſter gave him a ſtock to employ, upon a reſonable rent to be payd him yearly for certaine yeares: if ſo be the ſervant waſt the ſtock, Shall it not be lawfull for the Maſter nevertheleſſe to require his debt? And bid him pay that he owes him? This is the caſe we ſpeake of. In <hi>Adam</hi> we all have ſinned, ſaith the Apoſtle, and thereby have waſted that ſtock of grace which God had given us, and ſo diſabled our ſelves to performe that duty we owe to God: What therefore? Shall not God call upon us to pay our debts, becauſe we are become bankrupts? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially conſidering the naturall man is proud enough of his abilities to performe any thing that is good. And as for ability to believe, is there not a kind of faith per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by prophane perſons, by Hypocrites, who concurre with the beſt in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpell? Nay, Is there not a ſecret kind of hypocriſie, as when a man thinks his heart is upright towards God, when indeed it is not? Otherwiſe what ſhould move Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to call upon the Corinthians <hi>to examine themſelves whether they were in the faith, ſaying, Know you not your ſelves how that Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobates?</hi> 2 <hi>Car.</hi> 13. 5. It is true there is a faith infuſed by the ſpirit of God in regeneration; but who ever ſaid that any man was damned, becauſe he doth not believe with ſuch a faith? As much as to ſay, that non-regeneration is the meritorious cauſe of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now how well he hath proved that our Doctrine in the poynt of abſolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation is repugnant to Gods juſtice, let the indifferent judge.</p>

                              <p>THe Third Attribute which it oppugneth, is the truth of God. God is a God of truth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 4. Truth it ſelfe. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 6. So called becauſe he is the fountain of truth, and the perfection of truth, without the leaſt mixture of falſe-hood; the ſtrength of Iſraell cannot lye. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 29. Never could any man juſtly charge him with diſſembling; Let God be true and every man a lyar, (ſaith the Apoſtle) that he might be juſtified in his ſayings, and overcome when he is judged. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4. That is, men may lye, (for all men are lyars) but God cannot lye, (for God is true:) if any man ſhould goe about to challenge him of untruth, his challenge would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily appeare to be a calumny. The truth of God, like a glorious Sunne, will break through all thoſe clouds of accuſations which ſeek to obſcure and hide it. <hi>Simile gaudet Simili;</hi> God loves ſuch as are of a true heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51 6. And hath an hypocrite in utter deteſtation, and therefore he muſt needs be true himſelfe. No man (for ought I know) doubts of it.</p>
                              <p>But by this decree is God made untrue, and hypocriticall in his dealing with all men, and in all matters that concerne their eternall eſtate; particularly, in his commands, in his offers of grace and glory, in his threats, in his paſſionate wiſhes and deſires of mens chiefeſt good, and in his expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and commiſerations alſo.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. In his commands; for by this doctrine God commands thoſe men to repent and believe, whom he ſecretly purpoſeth ſhall never believe. Now whom God commands to believe and repent, thoſe he outwardly willes ſhould believe and repent. For by his commandements he ſignifies his will and pleaſure, and he muſt inwardly and heartily will it too, or elſe he diſſembles: For words if they be true, are an interpretation of the mind, when they are not, are meere impoſtures, and ſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. In his offers of grace and glory: theſe offers he makes to ſuch as refuſe them, and periſh for refuſing them, as well as unto thoſe who doe accept them to their ſalvation. This is evident <hi>Math.</hi> 22. where thoſe were invited to the wedding that came not. And <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 26. Where tis ſaid, To you hath God ſent his Sonne Jeſus to bleſſe you, in turning every one of you from your iniquities. <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 37. How oft would I have gathered of you, ſaith Chriſt, ſpeaking of ſuch as neglect the day of their viſitation, and ſo loſt their ſalvation: This is evident alſo by reaſon, for as many as are under the commandement, are under the promiſe too, as we may ſee, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39. Repent and be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed every one of you, and you ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt; for to you, and to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is the promiſe made. In which words <hi>Peter</hi> makes the command and the promiſe of equall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, both univerſall: And there is reaſon for it, for he makes the promiſe his motive to perſwade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the command; and it would not have reacht home, if it had not reſpected all thoſe, to whom he gives the command.</p>
                              <p>No man, Reprobate or other, thinks any leſſe; every man that hears the Goſpell Preached, takes himſelfe to be under the gratious offer of eternall life; and upon theſe thoughts hath ſome deſires, ſome hopes of it, and ſtirres up himſelfe to forſake ſome pleaſing ſinnes, which otherwiſe he would not part with, and to doe ſome unpleaſing duties, which otherwiſe he would not doe; Now, if God doth not meane that moſt of thoſe to whom he offers his grace and glory ſhall have either, will he not be found halting in his offers?</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Zanchy</hi> tells us roundly, that every man that is called, is bound to think that he is elected; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note place="margin">L. 5. <hi>de nat. Dei cap.</hi> 2.</note> he doth offer great injury unto God, and doth <hi>perſtringere Deum mendacii, qui illi in verbo dicit ſe velle ſalutem ejus, &amp; in hunc finem ad Chriſtum vocaſſe.</hi> In which ſpeech he plainly implies, that if God call a man, whom he hath abſolutely rejected, he doth but delude him when he calls him. The like ſpeech hath <hi>Bucer; Primum quod Deo debes, eſt ut credas eſſe te ab eo praedeſtinatum, nam id ni credas, facis eum tibi, cum te ad ſalutem vocat per evangelium, illudere.</hi> A man muſt believe that he is predeſtinated, <note place="margin">Bucer <hi>in cap.</hi> 8. <hi>ad Rom. q. de praedeſt.</hi>
                                 </note> or elſe he makes God to mock him when he calls him. A man therefore that is not predeſtinate, but an abſolute reprobate, when he is called to ſalvation, is but deluded; it is the neceſſary reſult of their ſpeeches. If a creditor ſhould reſolve upon no termes to forgive his debtor one farthing of the debt, and yet make him offers to remit the whole upon ſome conditions, and bind the offers which he makes, with a deep and ſolemne oath, Would we not ſay that he is a ranke diſſembler, and a meer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luder of his poor debtor? We can ſay no leſſe of God, if it be true that he hath irrevocably decreed, at no hand to ſave ſuch particular men, and yet promiſeth, and ſweareth, that he will ſave them if they will believe his promiſes and repent. What can ſuch promiſes be but meere deluſions of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable men?</p>
                              <p n="3">3. In his threats and commination alſo (by this doctrine) is God made to be hollow and unſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, for, Againſt what ſinnes are they denounced? Alwaies againſt actuall ſinnes: we never read that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56120:94"/>
they are denounced againſt us for originall ſinnes, for the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> or for that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ot nature, which we brought with us into the world; and conſequently they import that the ſinnes for which men goe to hell, are their actuall tranſgreſſions. But if it be true that God decreed man to hell for originall ſinne, that which thoſe threatnings import and ſignify is not true, and ſo God is not ſincere to them. Beſides; all threatnings imply, that evills threatned may be avoyded, for therefore are they denounced, that men by them might come to repentance, and ſo eſcape the evill that are threatned: but if ſome men be peremptorily ordained to deſtruction, then their deſtruction cannot be prevented, and ſo the threatning of damnation (in this reſpect alſo) doth ſignify an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, and God in them deales not plainly with men.</p>
                              <div type="sub-subsection">
                                 <head>TWISSE <hi>Conſideration.</hi>
                                 </head>
                                 <p>THat God is true, we make no more doubt than that there is a God at all: and that God is as farre from hypocriſy as hypocrites are farre from him. They that beat their fellow ſervants, and eate and drinke with the drunken, we are taught ſhall haue there portion with hypocrites: and we judge it impoſſible that God ſhould cheriſh any ſuch diſpoſition in himſelfe, which he ſo hates in others. But how God is made untrue and hypocriticall in his dealings with men in all (or in any) matters, that concerne their eternall eſtate by our doctrine of Reprobation, more than by our doctrine of election, it is a myſtery unto me; whether we conſider his commands, his offers of grace and glory, his threats, his paſſionate wiſhes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of mens chiefeſt good, and in his expoſtulations and commiſerations alſo. But come we to examine how learnedly and judiciouſly this is carryed throughout in the particulars.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. That God commands by his Miniſters many to believe and repent, whom he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly purpoſeth ſhall never believe we willingly grant; like as he comanded <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to ſacrifice <hi>Iſaack,</hi> and yet ſecretly purpoſed that he ſhould not ſacrifice him. This is evident by the word of God, for both his command given to <hi>Abraham</hi> to this purpoſe is there expreſſed, as alſo his effectuall hindering of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he came to the point of ſacrifyſing him; and looke what God did, that he ſecretly purpoſed to to doe: For he doth all things according to the counſell of his will <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 11. Only here is the difference, God commanding <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice his <hi>Sonne,</hi> did poſitively hinder him from ſacrificing <hi>Iſaack,</hi> but God commanding all to heare the Goſpell to believe, doth not hinder them from believing, when they are willing to beleive. But only refuſeth to give them that grace whereby alone their naturall infidelity might be cured; according to thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Yee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heare them</hi> (my wordes) <hi>not, becauſe yee are not of God. Iohn.</hi> 8. 47.</p>
                                 <p>Now let every ſober man judge, whether Gods courſe be not to be cenſured for hypocriſy, as well in the one as in the other: yet is this a moſt triviall argument, and thus uſually anſwered by our Divines, and particularly by Maſter <hi>Perkins.</hi> But this author takes no notice of this our common anſwer, to reply againſt it, but is content to pretermit it in ſilence; a manifeſt evidence that he hath nothing of worth to ſay againſt it: for I cannot conceive him to be ſo ignorant, as not to know this uſuall anſwer of our Divines. But let we him proceed in his courſe. <hi>Whom God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to believe and repent, thoſe he outwardly wills ſhould believe and repent; for by his commands he ſignifies his will and pleaſure, and he muſt inwardly and heartily will it too, or elſe he diſſembles.</hi> All this is as congruouſly appliable to Gods commandement given unto <hi>Abraham</hi> for the ſacrificing of <hi>Iſaack,</hi> as to the commandement of believing and repenting given unto any; although there is a vaſt difference between Gods commandement of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing <hi>Iſaack,</hi> and his commandement of believing. For God himſelfe gave the one immediately, and that to a particular perſon, <hi>Abraham:</hi> But God commands his Miniſters to preach his Goſpell unto all, that are preſent to heare them, and why? But as he tells <hi>Paul. Acts</hi> 18. 9. becauſe <hi>he hath much people,</hi> in the place whereto he ſends them, and yet tells them not who thoſe people are, who his elect are and who are not. But they, though thereupon they proceed to Preach unto all without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, yet ſo, as aiming at the ſalvation of the elect. <hi>I doe all things for all men,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56120:94"/>
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 22. <hi>That I may ſave ſome;</hi> and who are they? Let himſelfe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, where he ſaith, <hi>I ſuffer all things for the elects ſake;</hi> and by the way where he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth of <hi>Gods willing outwardly and inwardly,</hi> I willingly profeſſe I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 10.</note> read nor heard of it before. Gods words and commandements are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and uttered by him, but his will is alwaies inward, though it may be, and is ſignified by his words, and ſo is his will ſignified alwaies by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; But what will? Not that ſuch a thing as God commands ſhall be done, as this Author ignorantly conceives, but that it ſhall be their duty, (to whom the commandement is given) to doe that which is commanded: for if Gods will were that ſuch a thing ſhould be done <hi>de facto,</hi> undoubtedly it ſhould be done and come to paſſe <hi>de facto, for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> So that here we have <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 19.</note> a true interpretation of the mind of God by his commandement, to wit, <hi>quid ab homine fieri debeat,</hi> but no interpretation of any ſuch mind in God, as if <hi>fieri vellet,</hi> whatſoever he commands. For the caſe is cleare and undeniable that Gods will was, that <hi>Iſaack</hi> ſhould not be ſacrificed, as well as by his command, to make it <hi>Abrahams</hi> duty to ſacrifice him. The like was the caſe of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to whom the Lord ſent a meſſage by <hi>Moſes</hi> to let Iſraell goe: hereupon it was <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> duty to let Iſraell goe, and that upon Gods command, God thereby ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his will to make this act <hi>Pharaohs</hi> duty; But was it Gods will alſo that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſhould <hi>de facto</hi> obey, and let Iſraell goe upon this command? If ſo, why doth God tell <hi>Moſes</hi> that he <hi>will harden Pharaohs heart, and that he ſhall not let Iſraell goe.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Where we have a manifeſt example of the great difference of the objects of Gods will; the one what Gods will was, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ought to doe; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what his will was ſhould be done by him: the letting of Iſraell goe, was that which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ought to doe by the will of God, but the not letting of Iſraell goe by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> was that which God willed ſhould come to paſſe; And why doth not this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor take boldneſſe to cenſure theſe proceedings of the Lord with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> as hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall proceedings? The ſame ſpirit will ſerve the turne for both, though not without betraying as much judgement as honeſty. In the like ſort, it might be urged of the very elect, as of the reprobate, for the very elect are not alwaies converted at the firſt hearing of the Goſpell, nor till the time God hath appoynted for their effectuall vocation: yet from their firſt hearing of the Goſpell, this command is made unto them, and thereby is ſignified Gods will that they ought to believe it, yet is it not Gods will that they ſhall believe, and be converted untill the time that God hath appoynted. That which in my judgement is more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is this, that by commanding to believe, he ſuppoſeth them at leaſt in pretence to be indued with a power to believe; but then ſay I in like manner, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth them to be indifferent to believe or not to believe, as they will, that is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to yeeld or elſe to reſiſt; now this is indifferent to be objected as well againſt election, as againſt reprobation: For like as wee ſay it cannot be that the reprobate ſhould believe <hi>de facto,</hi> ſo wee ſay it cannot be, that the elect ſhould not beliefe at that time, <hi>de facto,</hi> which God hath appoynted for their effectuall converſion. And what advantage this Author can hence worke to himſelfe, I will be ready to take into conſideration, as ſoone as it is offered. So that hitherto I hope, I have freed the divine courſe maintained by us, from all juſt imputation of <hi>impoſture and diſſimulation:</hi> let him looke to it how he can cleare his conſcience from the impiety of his crimination. I come to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. Here thoſe <hi>offers of grace and glory,</hi> which wee aſcribe to God, he charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with impoſture and ſimulation. But he contents himſelfe with the generality of grace, that is for his beſt advantage. I will anſwere to each part. As for glory or ſalvation, wee offer it unto none, (neither doe we teach that God makes offer of it unto any) but to ſuch as finally perſevere in faith and repentance, according to that, Revelations 3. <hi>To him that overcometh, I will give to ſit with mee in my throne, even as I alſo overcame, and am ſet downe with my Father in his Throne. And be thou faithfull unto the death, and I will give thee a Crowne of life.</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>Be not weary of well doing, for in good time ye ſhall reape if ye faint not.</hi> And accordingly we teach, that it is the will of God, that <hi>as many as believe &amp; repent and perſevere therein, ſhall be ſaved:</hi> &amp; no other will of God is
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56120:95"/>
ſignified herein. And if this be true, that God doth will this, and no other thing then this is ſignified in his offers of glory and ſalvation.</p>
                                 <p>What colour of impoſture and diſſimulation, doth appeare in all this? For glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſalvation, God doth not will that it ſhall be the portion of any one of ripe yeares, abſolutely but conditionally, to wit, if he repent and believe. And in caſe all and every one of the World ſhould believe and repent, all and every one (how notorious ſinners ſoever they be found) ſhall be ſaved; ſuch is the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Chriſts merits. I ſay this is true, not of them only, who are invited to the Wedding. <hi>Math.</hi> 22. Nor of them only, to whom Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 26. Or to them only, of whom our Saviour ſpeaketh, <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 37. But of all and every one throughout the World: and it is as true, that none of them ſhall be ſaved, if they dye in infidelity and impenitency, this God himſelfe ſignifyeth to be his will by his promiſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 28, 29. on the one part, and on both parts, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. And as God ſignifieth this to be his will, ſo indeed is his will according to our doctrine, and there is no colour of impoſture or ſimulation in all this. In like ſort as touching the grace of pardon of ſinne, this alſo God offers unto all that heare the Goſpell, but how? Not abſolutely but conditionally, in caſe they believe and repent; and it is Gods will that every one who believeth, ſhall have his ſinne pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; none that I know either thinketh or teacheth otherwiſe, whether he falleth out either to be elect or reprobate; though how to diſtinguiſh men according unto this difference I know not, I leave that unto God.</p>
                                 <p>And accordingly as touching the <hi>deſire and hopes,</hi> that hereupon ariſe in the thoughts of Reprobates, I am nothing acquainted with them, any more than I am with their perſons: as likewiſe neither am I private to their ſtirring up of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>to forſake ſome pleaſing ſinnes, which otherwiſe they would not part with; and to doe ſome unpleaſing duties, which otherwiſe they would not doe:</hi> But in generall I have read in <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that God calleth ſome (though Reprobates) <hi>ut proficiant ad exteriorem vitae emendatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem quo mitius puniantur.</hi> But I can hardly believe, that <hi>Herod</hi> was any one of them, though he did many things at his admonition, becauſe I ſee a ſhamefull iſſue, giving way to the cutting off <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> head, for the gratifying of a wanton damſell.</p>
                                 <p>Now like as we ſay, God doth ſignify his meaning to be, that as many as believe and repent ſhall have their ſinnes pardoned, and their ſoules ſaved: So if it can be proved that there is no ſuch meaning in God, then in my poore judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it cannot be avoyded, but that God muſt be found halting in his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. But for my part, I acknowledge ſuch a meaning in God, neither have I to this houre, found any one of our Divines either by word or writing to have denyed this to be the meaning of God: and I wonder what this Author means af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner to carry himſelfe in the cloudes of generalities; and whether it be through ſillineſſe, or malitiouſneſſe I am to ſeeke: but if I may be ſo bold as to gueſſe, I think the root of all this his ſuperficiary diſcourſe is the confounding of abſolute Reprobation with abſolute Damnation, and in like ſort abſolute election with ſalvation abſolute: for as for pardon of ſinne, and ſalvation, we acknowledge them to be beſtowed on men of ripe years condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally; and as God beſtowes them, ſo alſo he decreed to beſtow them (we ſay) conditionally, to wit, in caſe they believe and repent: but in caſe they believe and repent not, damnation is their portion, and that by the decree of God. But as touching the gift of faith and repentance, theſe we maintain to be given of God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, according to the meere pleaſure of his will: and accordingly denyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, as the Apoſtle ſignifieth, ſaying, <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth.</hi> But this Author meddles not hither to with theſe gifts, but keeps <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 18.</note> himſelfe to the graces of pardon of ſinne, and of ſalvation, which God beſtowes conditionally; and ſignifies his meaning to be, to beſtow them conditionally, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in caſe they believe and repent, and not otherwiſe, and ſuch indeed we maintaine to have been his meaning, and that from everlaſting. So that in all this there is no colour of impoſture or ſimulation. But in that which followeth, he ſtealeth upon the grace of faith it ſelfe; let us ſee how clearely, and with what felicity he carryeth himſelfe, and whether it be not anſwerable to his former carriage which he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth throughout.</p>
                                 <p>

                                    <hi>Zanchy</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>tells us roundly, that every man that is called, is bound to think he is elected;</hi> but why doth he not ſpeake out and ſay, <hi>that every one is bound</hi> (in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Zanchy) to believe that he is elected,</hi> as formerly he related it. I grant that to believe is to think, for <hi>credere,</hi> is defined to be <hi>cum aſſenſione cogitare,</hi> but thoughts he knows are very wild, they have their courſe in dreames; as a hungry man may dreame that he eateth and drinketh, but when he awaketh, his ſoule is empty. And as for that doctrine of <hi>Zanchy,</hi> I have already given a faire interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, upon conſideration that he ſpeaks it of election not unto faith, but unto ſalvation: and ſeeing God hath manifeſted in his word his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give ſalvation to every one that believeth, it followeth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence, that every one is bound to believe, that as many as doe believe ſhall be ſaved: and conſequently every one that heareth the Goſpell is bound to believe, That God hath determined to beſtow Salvation on him, in caſe hee be found to believe. The like conſtruction may be given of <hi>Bucers</hi> Doctrine; namely, that God hath predeſtinated him to obtain Salvation in caſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, not otherwiſe. For God hath not predeſtinated any man of ripe years to obtain Salvation, whether he believe or not. And ſeeing God hath plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſed that whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 16. If I doe not accordingly believe, that God hath predeſtinated me to obtain ſalvation in caſe I doe believe, I doe hereby make God to delude me in ſaying <hi>Whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And whereas this Author upon the back of this addeth, <hi>that a man therefore that is not predeſtinate, but an abſolute reprobate, when he is called to ſalvation is but deluded; and that this is the neceſſary reſult of our ſpeeches.</hi> All the colour of this his inference, depends meerely upon confuſion of things that differ. For he diſtinguiſheth not between abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute predeſtination unto ſalvation, and predeſtination unto ſalvation abſolute: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he diſtinguiſheth not between abſolute reprobation unto damnation, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation unto damnation abſolute: neither doth he diſtinguiſh between predeſtination unto faith, and predeſtination unto ſalvation; nor between reprobation from faith, and reprobation unto damnation. And the abſoluteneſſe of predeſtination appears only in predeſtination unto faith, not in predeſtination unto ſalvation. For ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being beſtowed on none of ripe years, but by way of reward of their faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and good works; hence it followes, that God predeſtinates none unto ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ripe years, but by way of reward of their obedience. But as for predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto faith, it is cleare, that God purpoſeth abſolutely to beſtow faith on whom he will. So on the other ſide damnation being inflicted on none, but for ſinne God hath deſtinated no man unto damnation but for ſinne. But as touching obduration, like as God hardneth whom he will, ſo he decreed to proceed herein, to wit, in hardening of men according to the meere pleaſure of his will, that is, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely. Now let us not ſuffer a cauteriate conſcience, to ſmother a plain truth, with the confuſion of thoſe things which are to be diſtinguiſhed. Abſolute is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to conditionate; and this diſtinction applied to Gods will is to be underſtood not <hi>quoad actum volentis, ſed quoad res volitas;</hi> as for example, God decrees that a man ſhall be ſaved upon condition of faith, this is called <hi>voluntas conditionata,</hi> ſo <hi>oVſſius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it. <hi>Hiſt. Pelag. lib.</hi> 7. p. 638. his words are theſe, <hi>Aliqua vult cum conditione, quae idcirco in effectum non prodeunt niſi conditione impletâ.</hi> Some things (God) willeth with a condition, which come not unto effect, but upon the fulfilling of the condition; this is plainly underſtood, not of the act of willing, but of the things willed, which he calls <hi>aliqua,</hi> and the inſtance he gives us is this, <hi>quo modo omnes homines ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56120:96"/>
beſtowed abſolutely, to wit, according to the meer pleaſure of Gods will, hence it followeth that the will of God to conferre ſalvation, is only <hi>voluntas coditionata,</hi> and denominates not a man abſolutely predeſtinated, but only conditionally, ſtill under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it not <hi>quod actum volentis,</hi> but <hi>quoad res volitas,</hi> as <hi>Voſſius</hi> himſelfe interprets it, and that according to the ancients. In like ſort the will of God to inflict damnation, is a conditionate will according to the ſame conſtruction that <hi>Voſſius</hi> makes of a will conditionate, according to the Fathers; and denominates not a man abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated, but only conditionally. Now this being the will that <hi>Zanchy</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> ſpeak of, moſt prepoſterouſly doth this Author ſhape a man hereupon, to be termed an abſolute predeſtinate, or an abſolute reprobate: For in this reſpect, like as the will of God in this caſe, is accounted not <hi>abſoluta</hi> but <hi>conditionata,</hi> ſo the perſon deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated hereby, in all equity is to be accounted, not predeſtinated abſolutely, but conditionally, nor reprobated abſolutely but conditionally. But in reſpect of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will of God, I willingly confeſſe, one may be accounted predeſtinate abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and another reprobated abſolutely, to wit, in reſpect of the will of giving the grace of faith and repentance unto one, and denying it to another: And that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe faith and repentance are not given and denied upon any condition, but abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, according to the meer pleaſure of God; as we are ready to maintaine. But herehence no ſpecies of contradiction ariſeth, for like as it is no contradiction to ſay that God willeth abſolutely unto <hi>Paul</hi> the grace of faith and repentance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally willeth unto him and every one ſalvation, to wit, upon condition of faith and repentance: In like ſort, there is no contradiction to ſay, that the ſame man is predeſtinated abſolutely unto faith, and conditionally unto ſalvation: In like ſort it may be ſaid without all contradiction, that the ſame man is both reprobated abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely from faith, and yet reprobated conditionally from glory unto condemnation. And laſtly, in like manner, there is no contradiction to ſay, that the ſame man is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated conditionally to obtain ſalvation; and yet abſolutely reprobated from faith: eſpecially ſeeing it is all one, to be predeſtinated conditionally to obtain ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and conditionally to obtain damnation: For he that is ordained to be ſaved in caſe he believe, is therewithall ordained to be damned in caſe he believe not: The ground whereof is, that of our Saviour <hi>Whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved, whoſoever believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> Now if God may both will unto a man ſalvation conditionally, <note place="margin">Mar. 15. 16.</note> to wit, upon condition he believeth, and yet withall will the deniall of faith abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unto him, without all contradiction, (as I have already proved) it followeth, that without all contradiction, a man may be ſaid both to be predeſtinated to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſalvation conditionally, <hi>viz.</hi> In caſe he doe believe, and ſo to be predeſtinated abſolutely, to be hardned, or to have the grace of faith denyed him. So that this Authors concluſion depends meerely upon confuſion of different denominations of a man ſaid to be abſolutely, or conditionally predeſtinated: which may be in reſpect of different things whereto he is predeſtinated, to the one abſolutly, to the other conditionally, and conſequently without all contradiction. For he that is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprobated from the grace of faith, may yet be conditionally predeſtinated unto ſalvation. For to be conditionally predeſtinated unto ſalvation, is to be conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally predeſtinated unto damnation, and what ſober man will ſay, that there is any contradiction in this, to ſay, that the ſame man is both conditionally reprobated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to damnation, and abſolutely reprobated from faith. Faith being ſuch a gift of God, that like as God abſolutely beſtowes it on ſome, ſo as abſolutely he denies it to others. But as for condemnation, that is inflicted on none but for ſinne, like as ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is beſtowed on none of ripe years, but as a reward of obedience. In like manner God decreed not either to beſtow the one, or inflict the other but conditionally, to wit, upon condition of faith on the one ſide, and upon condition of infidelity on the other. Now if ſuch confuſion be committed in theſe denominations of the predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and reprobate, abſolutely and conditionally, on the part of things willed by God, as namely in reſpect of grace and glory on the one ſide, and in reſpect of the denyall of grace and glory, together with inflicting of damnation on the other; How much more muſt this confuſion be augmented, if not only different things willed by God (as before mentioned) are confounded, but over and above the act of Gods will is confounded with things willed by him. For as for the act of Gods will, that it admitts no condition, I have formerly demonſtrated by diverſe arguments; one whereof, and that invincible, is this; If ſinne be the cauſe or condition of Gods will,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56120:96"/>
or decree of damnation, then either by neceſſity of nature, or by the conſtitution of God; not by neceſſity of nature (as all confeſſe,) nor (ſay I) can it be by any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of God, as I prove thus; If by the conſtitution of God, then God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that upon the foreſight of ſinne, he will ordaine men unto ſalvation; where the eternall ordination of God, is made the object of Gods eternall ordination; a thing utterly impoſſible, it being apparent that nothing can be the object of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ordination or decree, but things temporall. The ſimilitude whereby he illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, not his concluſion, but the pretended abſurdity of our doctrine, is moſt ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ene. For God is not like unto a creditor, <hi>Who reſolves upon no termes to forgive his debtor one farthing of his debt, and yet makes offer to remit the whole debt upon ſome conditions.</hi> For as God hath profeſſed that <hi>whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> ſo; Hath not God reſolved that <note place="margin">Mar. 16. 16.</note> 
                                    <hi>whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved?</hi> Was ever any of our Divines known to deny this? But herein they joyne iſſue with their adverſaries, as the Contra-Remonſtrants did with the Remonſtrants, namely, in maintaining that this is not the whole decree of prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination; But that there is another decree of predeſtination beſides this; namely, that God over and above hath determined to beſtow faith on ſome. So on the other ſide, none of our Divines were ever known to deny, that God hath decreed, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believes not ſhall be damned; but further they profeſſe, that this is not the whole decree of reprobation, but that there is another decree concerning reprobation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, namely, that God hath over and above decreed to deny ſome the grace of faith, and that abſolutely. Now whereas he ſaith, we maintain that God hath irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocably decreed not to ſave ſome, whom he promiſeth that he will ſave if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; Is he well in his witts, for charging us with that, by way of crimination, which no underſtanding Divine among the Arminians themſelves dare deny? I mean as touching the poynt of Gods irrevocable decree. For what Arminian hath dared in plain tearmes to profeſſe, that Gods decrees are of a revocable nature? Whereas the meere preſcience of God, is ſufficient to make them irrevocable; How much more if Gods preſcience be grounded upon his decree? as indeed there is no other ground imaginable, without falling upon manifeſt Atheiſme. But whereas he faſhioneth our Doctrine, ſo as if we ſaid, that God hath decreed at no hand to ſave them, to whom he promiſeth ſalvation upon condition of faith; this is a notorious untruth, and ſuch as implyeth manifeſt contradiction: For to ſay he hath reſolved <hi>at no hand to ſave them,</hi> is as much as to ſay, that he hath reſolved to ſave them on no condition. But if he hath promiſed to ſave them in caſe they believe, undoubtedly he hath reſolved, to ſave them upon condition of faith. Only Gods reſolution to ſave them, is not held in ſuſpence, conſidering that from everlaſting, he well knew who would believe, and who would not; and therefore he knew this, becauſe he purpoſed to grant faith unto the one, and deny it unto the other. So that in all this cry, we have little wooll, no ſubſtance of any ſound proofe, but meere clamours and miſerable confuſion; as God ſees how well it becomes him to ſmite them with the ſpirit of confuſion, that build Babell of their own invention, and oppoſe the truth, the precious truth of his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over his creatures, and of the prerogative of his free grace, to have mercy on whom he will, like as he ſhewes his power in hardening whom he will, and in ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with giddineſſe whom he will.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. In the next place, we are to heare how God, by our Doctrine in <hi>his threats and comminations is hollow, and unſincere.</hi> I willingly grant theſe are alwaies denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt actuall ſinnes, as alſo that the ſinnes for which men goe to hell, are actuall ſinnes, if they live to be conſcious of actuall tranſgreſſions. <hi>But if God have decreed men to hell for originall ſinne, then God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not true, and ſo not ſincere.</hi> This is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequent; For God can manifeſt his pleaſure otherwiſe than by his threatnings. Of the Sodomites it is ſaid, <hi>they ſuffer the vengeance of eternall fire;</hi> and Infants periſhed therein, as well as men of ripe years: And the Apoſtle plainly ſaith, that <hi>we have all ſinned in Adam, and that the wages of ſinne is death,</hi> without diſtinction; and that all are <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12. Rom. 6. 22. Epheſ. 2. 3.</note> borne children of wrath, and therefore as many as dye in that condition, dye chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath. And whence hath this Author learned, that the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> hath brought upon us the guilt of eternall death, as formerly he hath profeſſed: but if I be not deceived, this extends farther than to Infants, and in as much as ſome of our Divines conceive the corrupt maſſe, to be the object of reprobation, hereupon he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, they make God to damne all Reprobates for originall ſinne; whereas their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is no other than this, that God determines to damne every man for no other
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56120:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſinnes, but ſuch wherein they dye unrepented of, whether they be originall or actuall. Threatnings are denounced unto all to this end, that men may know, that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in ſinne without repentance there is no hope of mercy, and therefore as they deſire to be ſaved, it is there duty to breake them off by repentance: And in particular unto ſome that by this conſideration, God may bring them unto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But theſe are only Gods elect, but as for others God never brings unto them true repentance, according to that of S. <hi>Auſtin, Iſtorum neminem adducit Deus ad ſalubrem ſpiriitalem<expan>

To this I anſwer, that by the ſame reaſon he might conclude, that God carrieth himſelfe with guile, in taking unto himſelfe eyes, and eares, and hands, and heart, for hereby he makes ſhew that he hath the members of a man. But to this we anſwer, that this ſhew is only unto them that underſtand that properly, which is to be taken figuratively: ſo that it is not the word of God, ſo much as the weakneſſe of men in underſtanding it, that caſts this colour. For theſe things indeed, are ſpoken only per <gap reason="foreign">

And if God takes liberty to conforme himſelfe to the members of our body, may not he take as great liberty to conforme himſelfe to the paſſions of our minds, and to aſſume unto him, the paſſions of feare, wrath, and jealouſy, joy, ſorrow, and ſuch like? <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63. 8. <hi>For he ſaid ſurely they are my people, Children that will not lye, ſo he was their Saviour:</hi> yet what followeth in the next verſe ſave one: <hi>But they rebelled and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his holy ſpirit.</hi> According to the courſe of this Divines ſuperficiall conſideration, a man might conceive, that God is ſubject to errour, and improvidence, as well as man; for God ſaid <hi>ſurely they will not lye,</hi> but it appeared by the event, that they did lye.

In like ſort, God in his paſſionate wiſhes, conformes himſelfe to the condition of man, who uſeth this ſometimes, as a means to worke impreſſion upon his child, to be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to order his converſation towards his parents. And this being apt to work upon a child, though but naturally ingenuous, why may not God uſe this courſe? nay if he ſhould not uſe this courſe, he could not be ſaid to doe all for his vineyard, that could be done, in the way of outward husbandry. So that paſſionate wiſhes, are but a paſſionate kind of exhortation; <hi>God through us doth beſeech you</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) we pray you in Christs ſtead, to be reconciled unto God.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. Yet nevertheleſſe the ſame Apoſtle profeſſeth that the <hi>Goſpell was a ſavour of death unto death to ſome,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. Now the Goſpell includes all theſe and ſuch like patheticall admonitions; And hereby God doth effectually ſignify, how much he delights in the obedience of the creature, and in the glorifying of his mercy in their ſalvation. But yet this mercy of God, in giving the grace of obedience, is not ſhewed indifferently towards all, but only to ſome, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven whom the Lord will. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18.

Pſal.</hi> 81. 13. Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Iſrael had walked in my waies! who doubts but that it was in the power of God, to work them hereunto, by boaring their eares, and circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, by regenerating them, and ſo making them to be borne of God; that <hi>ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, they might heare his words.

Yet this might be a means and alſo was, and is, and ever ſhall continue to be a means to bring Gods people to repentance. And undoubtedly the worſt of them, had power to have abſtained from many of thoſe foule ſinnes, yea from all of them, wherewith God doth upbraid them; albeit to abſtaine from any ſinne in a gracious manner, be a worke of Gods ſpeciall grace, which he affords not, according to mens workes (which way tends all this eager but ſuperficiary diſcourſe) but according to his own purpoſe and grace. 3. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11. 8. God repreſents as it were a conflict within him, between his mercy and juſtice; and his mercy hath the glory of the day; But wherein? To ſpare them, though their ſinnes deſerved at his hands, that he ſhould make them as <hi>Adma</hi> and <hi>Zeboim,</hi> as <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> He would rather ſhew himſelfe to be as he is, <hi>God,</hi> and and not <hi>Man;</hi> And wherein? But in this, man may pardon his enemy, but cannot change his heart, it is otherwiſe with God, he can both pardon our ſinnes, and change our hearts, and to this purpoſe he becomes our Lord and our God, and walkes in the midſt of us, as the holy one of Iſraell, to <hi>ſanctify us,</hi> as it followeth in the ſame place of <hi>Hoſea, v.</hi> 10. <hi>They ſhall walk after the Lord, he ſhall roare like a Lyon, viz.</hi> In ſuch expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulations, comminations, &amp;c. but the iſſue ſhall be gracious; for <hi>when he ſhall reare, then the children of the Weſt ſhall feare,</hi> that <hi>is feare unto him,</hi> as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3. 5. That is, come fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him, and to his goodneſſe with feare: like Birds ſcared from one place, fly with greater ſpeed to another: ſo conſcience affrighted with ſenſe of ſinne, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Gods wrath, ſhall fly from his wrath, unto his mercy, <hi>to his goodneſſe:</hi> whereof God ſhall make unto them a full repreſentation in <hi>David</hi> their King, that is in Chriſt, as in whom we behold the glory of Gods grace with open face, and <hi>trepida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> in Latine, is found to be of the ſame ſignification with <hi>feſtinare.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 11.

As for that <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 37. O Jeruſalem, how oft would I: &amp;c. This is of another nature, as being delivered by Chriſt the ſonne of God, made under the Law, who, as in his manhood, he might entertaine ſuch deſires in proper ſpeech, ſo by the Law of God, was bound to deſire the converſion of his brethren, as well as any other Prophet, or man of God, or miniſter of his word. But ſuch confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion becomes this diſcourſe right well.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>In all this</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>there is little ſincerity, if there be a ſecret reſolution, that the moſt of theſe, towards whom thoſe wiſhes, chidings, and commiſerations are uſed, ſhall be unavoydably damned.</hi> But what if but one of them, towards whom theſe are uſed, by a ſecret reſolution ſhall be unavoydably damned, is there ſincerity enough in theſe courſes divine? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>if this reſolution, concerning the unavoydable damnation of the one, doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice Gods ſincerity, neither ſhall ſuch a reſolution concerning the damnation of two, or of two hundred, or thouſands, or the moſt, any way prejudice ſincerity di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. But this kind of diſcourſe, is ſpread all over this Treatiſe, like a ſcab only to worke upon vulgar affection, where judgement is wanting to obſerve the frothy condition of it. And whereas he ſaith that in all this God <hi>aliud animo vult aliud verbis ſignificat,</hi> its moſt untrue, as to every one ſhould be made manifeſt, according to the right underſtanding of it, had he been pleaſed to accommodate it ſeverally, and ſhew what that is, which God ſignifies by his word, and what that is, which he willeth in his heart. And indeed, as in the poynt of Gods commandement, I have ſhewed there is no colour of contradiction between it, and Gods purpoſe, but only according to this Authors ſuperficiary interpretation. For to command a thing, is only to will, that it ſhall be our duty to doe it: notwithſtanding which, it is apparent, God may purpoſe not to give grace to worke the doing of it. So in every one of the reſt, had he inſtanced as it became him, and ſhewed wherein the guile conſiſted, the abſurdity of this crimination might have been made as manifeſt as in this. That which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceales,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56120:98"/>
and which he would have his readers rather take to themſelves, than ſhew himſelfe clearely to ſtand to the maintainance thereof, ſeems to be this; that every one hath power given him to believe, to repent, to change his heart, yea to regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate himſelfe, but it ſticks in his teeth, and he dares not ſpeake it out plainly. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he keepes himſelfe to Gods reſolution, concerning mans unavoydable damnation; yet we maintaine not that any contingent things come to paſſe unavoydably, that were utterly againſt the nature of a contingent thing, which is to come to paſſe, ſo as joyned with a poſſibility of not coming to paſſe. And as for damnation in particular, we acknowledge it throughout, to be avoydable by repentance, and not otherwiſe, unto men of ripe years: And as for repentance, we ſay, that there is no man but may repent as long as he lives, through grace: ſo that in the iſſue the maine poynt to be debated herein is, whether every man living hath ſuch a grace given him as whereby he may repent. But upon this poynt though his whole diſcourſe be grounded thereupon, yet is he content to ſay juſt nothing; leaſt their ſhamefull and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable courſes in diſhonouring the grace of God, ſhould be diſcovered and brought to light. But conſider in a word or two as touching this <hi>univerſall grace,</hi> which they make to conſiſt in the inabling of the will, <hi>to will any goodthing whereunto they ſhall be excited.</hi> If ſuch a grace be univerſall, then every one hath power to believe, and power to repent. But this is untrue, for the Apoſtle telleth us of ſome, <hi>that they cannot repent. Rom.</hi> 2. 4. of the naturall man, <hi>that he cannot diſcerne the things of God; and that they are fooliſhneſſe unto him;</hi> and while they ſeeme fooliſhneſſe unto him, is it poſſible that therein <hi>he ſhould diſcerne the wiſdome of God?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. our Saviour tells us of ſome, that <hi>they cannot believe: Ioh.</hi> 12. 46. and tells others to their face, ſaying, <hi>How can you believe, when ye receive honour one of another, and ſeeke not the honour that comes from God only, Ioh.</hi> 5. 44. Likewiſe of them that are in the fleſh Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>They cannot pleaſe God. Rom.</hi> 8. 8. 2. It is the habit of faith that inables us to believe, ſo that if all men have power to believe, it muſt be confeſſed, that all men have faith, but the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Fides non eſt omnium;</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1. he ſaith it is <hi>electorum;</hi> like as <hi>Auſtin</hi> profeſſeth <hi>Habere fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, ſicut &amp; habere charitatem gratiae eſt fidelium: de praedeſt. Sanct. cap.</hi> 5. 3. Whoſoever hath power to prduce a vitall act, hath life in him; and conſequently, whoſoever hath power to produce any act of the life of grace, hath the life of grace in him: But the acts of faith and repentance, are the acts of the life of grace, therefore whoſoever hath power to produce theſe, hath in him the life of grace. But this is not true of all, for the Scripture teſtifies of ſome, that they are dead in ſinne. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1. Are ſtrangers from the life of God. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18. Againe, then all ſhould be regenerated, but that is untrue, for regeneration is ſignified, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. in Scripture to be wrought by the word of God. 1 <hi>Peter.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 17. But all have not the word of God. 4. If a man hath power to believe and repent, then the reaſon why a man doth not believe and repent, is not becauſe he cannot, but becauſe he will not; ſo that in the iſſue it comes to this, that a man may believe if he will, repent if he will; But ſuch a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is not grace, but nature rather, as appears by <hi>Auſtin.</hi> l. 1. <hi>de Gtneſi contra Manich. cap.</hi> 3. where he profeſſeth, that <hi>omnes poſſunt credere ſi velint:</hi> now compare this, with that he hath in the ſame place, where though he ſaith that <hi>omnes credere poſſint ſi velint,</hi> yet <hi>poſſe credere,</hi> ſimply taken, ariſeth meerely out of the gift of charity; which he profeſſeth to be <hi>gratiae fidelium, de praedeſt. Sanct. c.</hi> 5. But there he profeſſeth that <hi>poſſe habere fidem,</hi> is <hi>naturae hominum,</hi> the very naturall condition of all men. I farther prove it by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus; Look by what power I can believe if I will, by the ſame power I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to believe if I will; Now ſuch a power is no other, then whereby a man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to doe good or evill: but ſuch a condition is not grace; for grace is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, now goodneſſe doth not diſpoſe any, either to good or evill indifferently, but preciſely to that which is good; like as naughtineſſe diſpoſeth a man only to that which is evill.</p>
                                 <p>He ſleepes ſo ſweetly upon his Arminian pillow, that his very dreames make him confident of the evidence of his deductions. And he gives reaſons for it, and that of moſt force for conviction, namely the confeſſion of his adverſaries; the <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of abſolute reprobation, for even they,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>doe not deny this, but aſcribe unto God ſanctam ſimulationem, duplicem perſonam, duplicem voluntatem.</hi> But he names none, content to ſing to himſelf &amp; his Muſes throughout, when he relats what our ſides anſwer to his profound diſcourſes. And I commend his wiſdome more then his honeſty in this, for if he had quoted his Authors herein, it may be ſomething might have bin diſcovered that would
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56120:99"/>
be little pleaſing unto him: yet herein he confounds things much different; for as for a double will aſcribed unto God, all the Learned doe acknowledge ſo much, and the Scriptures teſtify it; as namely, that his decree is called the will of God: as, <hi>what the Lord willeth, that hath he done, both in heaven and in earth, and who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> as alſo that Gods commandement is called uſually the will of God, as, <hi>This is the will of God, even your ſanctification, that every one ſhould know how to poſſeſſe his veſſell in holineſſe, and honour, and not in the luſt of concupiſcence, as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles doe which know not God.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 4, 5. as for <hi>duplicem perſonam,</hi> that is a phraſe which I never read before, yet the phraſe of <gap reason="foreign">

                                    </gap>, is uſually in the Holy Scripture, as when God takes unto him both the members of a mans body, and the paſſions of his mind; and ſo ſpeakes in the way of condeſcenſion to our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as to put upon himſelfe the perſon of a man: and this is undenyable by all that are not <hi>Anthropomorphites.</hi> And as touching our bleſſed Saviour, we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in him <hi>duplicem naturam,</hi> a double nature, though not <hi>duplicem perſonam,</hi> a double perſon, and accordingly ſometimes, he both ſpeakes of himſelfe, and is ſpoken of, as touching the nature of his God-head, and ſometimes as touching the nature of his Man-hood. As for the firſt, that alone is materiall to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe, namely, as touching <hi>Sancta Simulatio,</hi> aſcribed unto God by our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. Now it were worth the while to know who is his Author in this, and that of the paſſages alleadged by this Author, doth profeſſe that they doe repreſent in God <hi>an holy kind of ſimulation:</hi> How could he exſpect that this ſhould give any ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, ſeeing he conceales the Author of it? And what reader would not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, with a very greedy deſire to know the Author of ſuch an interpretation of the paſſages alleadged by this.

But this anſwer is too ſhort. Tis true indeed, God will have all men to be ſaved only upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they will believe and repent; according to the ſpeech of Saint <hi>Ambroſe, Deus vult omnes ſalvari ſi &amp; ipſi velint;</hi> for if he would abſolutely have it ſo what can hinder it? who hath reſiſted his will? And it is true likewiſe that a conditionall promiſe may be ſeriouſe as well as an abſolute; but then the condition muſt be poſſible unto them, to whom the offer and promiſe is made; and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the condition muſt be a part of Gods will, as well as the ſalvation promiſed; or elſe the promiſe cannot be candid and ſincere. In ſubſtance it is all one, not to offer a curteſy at all and and to offer it under a condition not poſſible, and in circumſtance it is farre better to deny a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite abſolutly, than ſo to promiſe it. For ſuch a promiſe is a denyall under a colour of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. The Lawyers tell us that a contract <hi>Sub conditione impraeſtabili nullus aeſtimatur:</hi> And the Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, that <hi>propoſitio conditionalis quae habet annexam conditionem impoſſibilem, aequipollet ſimpliciter neganti.</hi> Any offer which is made upon a condition not performeable by the party is equivalent to a bare negation. It is all one for a man to deny a piece of money flatly to one blind man, and to promiſe it to another blind man upon a condition that he will looke upon it with his eyes, and it is all one for a man that hath a daughter to beſtow in marriage to tell the ſuitor I will giue you my daughter if you will but ſpan the earth and touch the heavens with your finger; and to tell him plainly, ſet your heart at reſt I will never beſtow her upon you. And thus have I ſhewed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of this opinion to the principall attributes of God: which is my ſecond generall reaſon againſt it</p>

                                    <hi>ſaved:</hi> Neither is this any wiſh as this Author faigneth, neither doth any of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſay, that ever I read, or till now heard of, that <hi>God wiſheth that all that believe ſhall be ſaved;</hi> this being a moſt abſurd ſpeech and contradiction to the ordinance of God. For thoſe things which God or man are ſaid to wiſh, are ſuch which doe not alwaies come to paſſe: but this ordinance of God, <hi>whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> is more ſtable than the covenant which God hath made with day and night. Not any Arminian that ever I read, doth expreſſe himſelfe in ſo proſtitute a manner, as to ſay, <hi>God ſeriouſly wiſheth the ſalvation of Reprobates, in caſe they believe.</hi> For he hath not wiſhed, but ordained, and made it a poſitive law, that <hi>whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> and herehence it followeth, that if all and every one, from the beginning of the World to the end, ſhall believe in Chriſt, all and every one of them ſhall be ſaved. But when <hi>they ſpeake of velleity in God,</hi> or wiſhing, the object thereof they make not to be <hi>the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men in caſe they repent,</hi> but abſolutely <hi>the ſalvation of men:</hi> which kind of <hi>velleity,</hi> is reſolved indeed in the iſſue, into a conditionate will, thus; Gods will is, that all ſhall be ſaved in caſe they repent: not thus, <hi>I doe wiſh that all may be ſaved in caſe they repent,</hi> according to the moſt abſurd fiction of this Author. At length he grants that <hi>God will have all men to be ſaved, only upon condition they will believe and repent; and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall promiſe may be ſerious, as well as an abſolute: but then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the condition muſt be poſſible to them, to whom the offer and promiſe is made, and the performance of the condition muſt be a part of Gods will, as well as the ſalvation promiſed, or elſe the promiſe cannot be candid and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</hi> Whereto I anſwer, that it is confeſſed on both ſides, that God hath ordained, that all that believe ſhall be ſaved, and conſequently it muſt be granted, that the promiſe of ſalvation hereupon, to wit, upon faith, muſt needs be candid and ſincere, it being the promiſe of God. Now ſhall we herehence inferre hand over head, that therefore <hi>the condition muſt be poſſible unto all, in ſpight</hi> of all other evidences to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, though never ſo plainly and expreſſely laid downe unto us in holy Scripture; as namely, that a <hi>naturall man perceives not the things of God, they are fooliſhneſſe unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14.

his ſpots. <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23. This is the immodeſt courſe of this Author, to ſet up one piece of Scripture, by his paltry conſequences, to outface another, nothing leſſe evident. Notwithſtanding this Scripture diſcovereth unto us, how this impotency of doing good, is contracted unto us all, by ſinning in <hi>Adam,</hi> as whereupon we were bereaved of grace, and of the ſpirit of God: yet if he would deale fairely, and deny originall ſinne, he ſhould erre no more then <hi>Pelagius</hi> did, and withall, he ſhould have as much ingenuity as <hi>Pelagius</hi> had: But now though equall to him in the one, yet is he inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to him in the other. But come we nearer to him than ſo; What one of our Divines denyeth the performance of this condition to be poſſible to al men? But is it fit that he ſhould talke of poſſibility (as he doth at large,) without any reference to the grace of God? And dares he ſay that it is poſſible to any man, whether elect or reprobate, without grace? I ſay he dares not ſay ſo much, though like enough, he and all the Sect of them, have a good mind to it. What then is the iſſue of all this Controverſy between us, but to enquire what manner of grace that is, without which it cannot be, that any ſhould believe? Is it only ſuch a grace, as gives only power to believe? This is no better than plain Pelagianiſme, as appears by <hi>Auſtin de grat. Chriſt. cont. Pelag. &amp; coeleſt. c.</hi> 6. and in the end, where he comes to make an overture for the compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Controverſy between them: Or, Is it ſome other grace prevenient, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only Morally by way of perſwaſion? This alſo appears clearely to have been the opinion of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> in the ſame book of <hi>Auſtin</hi> cap. 10. And he challengeth him to the acknowledging of another manner of grace, if he will not only be called a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but be indeed a Chriſtian: Or Laſtly, is it only grace ſubſequent, by way of concourſe, as to ſay, that God workes in us the act of believing, provided that we will believe? This, this is that <hi>Helena,</hi> that our homeborne Arminians are inamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with, meere Pelagianiſme: for who ſeeth not, that thus <hi>the grace of faith is confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> 
                                    <note place="margin">Ro. 9. 18, 19.</note> 
                                    <hi>according to the acts of willing in men,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, tis conferred accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to works. Then marke yet farther abſurdities; for thus God hath not mercy on whom he will in giving faith, but on whom man will; and what colour is there in this caſe, for any ſuch objection to be made hereupon, as is deviſed by the Apoſtle? Thou wilt ſay then, why doth he yet complaine, for who hath reſiſted his will? Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſider; Doth not God in this manner concurre to the moſt ſinfull act that is commited in the world? And why then doe we not as well ſay; that the commiſſion of ſinne is not poſſible without grace ſubſequent; for certainly tis not poſſible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out divine concourſe. Laſtly ſay farther, what is the grace required to the very act of willing; Doth God work this alſo by grace ſubſequent? As much as to ſay, God works in us the act of willing, provided we worke it in our ſelves. Such morſells as theſe can eaſily goe downe with theſe ſtomacks, which are apt to tumultuate upon the hearing that God hath power to make whom he will veſſells of mercy, or veſſells <note place="margin">Rom: 9. 21, 22, 23.</note> of wrath; man muſt be the crafts-maſter of his own fortunes, and it were neither agreeable to Gods mercy, nor to his juſtice, nor to his truth, unleſſe their free-will hath the greateſt glory of their converſion; and God be admitted no more to the working of that act of faith, and of repentance, than to the working of the moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full act that is committed in the world. But I find it nothing ſtrange, that as many as refuſe to be in ſubjection unto God, have liberty enough to be made vaſſalls, and be brought in ſubjection unto their own corrupt and unreaſonable fancies. For the word of God forſooth muſt be tempered, and interpreted according to the rules of their reaſon; their reaſon muſt not be ordered, and ſquared according unto the word of God. But to proceed, the Lawyers rule of the nullity of a contract, <hi>ſub conditione impraeſtabili,</hi> is nothing to the preſent purpoſe: For the caſe is not alike between man and man; and between God and man. God ſtands not at the pleaſure of man, to contract in what manner he thinks good. And when he hath given him power to performe, whatſoever at any time he ſhall command him; if man diſable himſelfe, ſhall God hereby be deprived of his right to command what he thinks good, and to puniſh for diſobedience as he thinks good? We read of ſome, that have cut off their thumbs, to diſable themſelves for military ſervice: is it not juſt with men to puniſh ſuch, as runne away after they have received their preſſe monies? But there is yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther geofaile in the accommodation of this rule of Law. For, <hi>conditio impraeſtabilis</hi> there, is ſuch as cannot be performed by reaſon of impotency naturall; but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency we ſpeake of, in the caſe between God and man, is meerely impotency mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; to wit, therefore they cannot, becauſe they will not, were it not for the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56120:102"/>
of their will, no power were wanting in man to believe, and repent. But as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> ſaith, alleadged by the Brittaine Divines out of <hi>Retract.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Voluntas ſine charitate eſt tota vitioſa cupiditas;</hi> and upon the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> artic. <hi>De converſione, qua denotat imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatum opus Dei hominem regenerantis.

Jer.</hi> 17. 14. <hi>Sana me domine &amp; Sanabor.</hi> And out of the Synodicall Epiſtle of the Biſhops of Africa to the ſame purpoſe, they alleadge this paſſage, <hi>In vivificandis hominibus Deus nullum initium voluntatis humanae expectat, ſed ipſam voluntatem bonam faciendo vivificat.</hi> And alſo that of <hi>Auſtin de corep. &amp; gra. cap.</hi> 14. <hi>Creatio in Chriſto in libertatem voluntatis facta eſt, &amp; ſine nobis: ſi in libertatem, tum non ex libertate: ſi ſine nobis, tum penes nos non eſt hoc Dei opus impedire.</hi> Be it all one <hi>to deny a piece of mony flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a blind man, and to promiſe it upon a condition, that he will looke upon it with his eyes:</hi> In like ſort, as touching the Reprobate, God hath no purpoſe to give ſalvation, but to deny it rather; although he give this generall rule, that whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved; <note place="margin">Mark. 16. 16.</note> and therefore he gives this rule, becauſe he purpoſeth by theſe means, to draw his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect unto Chriſt by faith; ſuch a manner being moſt agreeable to their reaſonable natures. And the reaſon why the rule is propoſed to all, is, becauſe partly Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are not acquainted with Gods counſell ſo farre, as to know whom he hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; partly in reſpect that the more carnall men are, the more confident they are of performing any ſuch duties, I meane of power to performe it, as namely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to obey, to repent: partly to the end, that ſome hereby may be brought, <hi>ad exteriorem vitae emendationem, quo mitius puniantur,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſometimes ſpeaketh: as alſo becauſe there is a kind of faith, performeable by a naturall man; for we ſee both prophane perſons and Hypocrites, concurre in an outward profeſſion of Chriſtianity, with the children of God: yet there is a great difference between blindneſſe naturall, and blindneſſe ſpirituall; for in the one there is a will and deſire to ſee, not ſo in the other; the one being impotency naturall, the other morall. And in a word, there is no impotency morall in man, that hath not been brought upon him through ſinne, either originall, of actuall. As for the ſpanning of the earth, or touching the heaven with ones finger, this never was in the power of man; but to believe any word of God, I hope this Author will not deny to have been ſometimes in the power of man: nay he ſeems to be of opinion, that it is in the power of all men ſtill, yet he would not be thought to deny originall ſinne. One thing yet remaines to be conſidered; he ſaid <hi>to whom the promiſe of ſalvation is made, the performance of the condition, muſt be a part of Gods will, as well as the ſalvation promiſed:</hi> But of what will of God muſt this be a part? Of his will as it ſignifies his commandement? We grant it is; for he commands, ſaying, Repent and believe the Goſpell; and by this commandement it is apparent, that it is the will of God, that it ſhall be the duty of every man, that hears this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to obey it. But will he have it a part of Gods will, to worke it effectually in all? And how I pray? Either by way of grace prevenient, or by way of grace ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent? Not by way of grace prevenient, for then all that heare the Goſpell, ſhould believe and be ſaved; for to worke Faith effectually that way, is to worke the will unto Faith. As for the working of it by way of grace <hi>ſubſequent;</hi> this I have been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught by an Arminian, to be no other than the working of it by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and that depends on the will of man: and we doe not deny, but that if any Reprobate will believe, God will concurre to the working of this beliefe; but ſo we ſay, (and no Arminian that I know will deny it) that if man will work any ſinfull act, God will concurre to the working of it; in as much as 'tis generally held, that no acts of the creature, can be performed without Gods concurrence thereunto. Now how well, and how judicially this Author hath plaid his part in ſhewing the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of our opinion to the Attributes of God, I am content the indifferent may judge.</p>

Now as God made himſelf known by his works ſo I nothing doubt but herewithall it was their duty to know him, and according to their knowledge to ſerve him and glorifie him, in acknowledgment of his glorious nature, ſo farre as they took notice of it; But as for a rule whereby they ſhould worſhip him, I know none that God had given them, or that they could gather from contemplation of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And ſurely the knowledge of God, as a Creator only, is nothing ſufficient to ſalvation; but the knowledge of him as a redeemer: And therefore <hi>ſeeing the World by wiſdome knew not God in the wiſdome of God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſſe of Preaching to ſave them that believe.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21.

he inſiſts hath nothing at all of any poſſibility of knowledge of God unto ſalvation, arriveable unto by the meere contemplation of the creature; neither have I found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Oracle throughout the Nation of the Arminians.

In like ſort, he diſcourſeth very confidently of the end of man, without diſtinction of any relation hereof; as if the end of man were equally known as well by light of nature, as by revelation of Gods word. <hi>Solomon</hi> telleth us, <hi>That God made all things for himſelfe, even the wicked againſt the day of evill.</hi> Was this known to the Gentiles by the light of nature? Not one of all the <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 4.</note> Philoſophers of old acknowledged the Worlds creation out of nothing; and who ever manifeſted any ſuch faith among them, as of enjoying a perpetuall ſociety with God in heaven? But it may be they all erred in interpreting the book of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture aright, and underſtanding the language thereof concerning this poynt of faith. This Author may doe well to cleare the World of this errour, and that out of the book of the creatures, and then proceed to interpret unto us therehence, a generall reſurrection alſo. And if he could find Chriſt there too, togeather with the Incarnation of the Sonne of God, and his death and paſſion, reſurrection and aſcenſion, and ſitting at the right hand of God to make requeſt for us, and our juſtification by faith in him, togeather with regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo, and the generall judgement; then no doubt though the Goſpell ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 32.</note> to be a ſcandall to the Jewes, yet ſurely through the incomprehenſible benefit of his comfortable atchievements, it ſhould continue no longer to be fooliſhneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gentiles; only our faith ſhould then ceaſe, and be turned into ſight, before we are brought to the ſeeing of the face of God. And yet I ſee no great need of Chriſt, if it be in the power of an Heathen man to know what it is to pleaſe God, and to have an heart to pleaſe him; For certainly as many as know what it is to pleaſe God, and have an heart to pleaſe him, God will never hurt them, much leſſe damne them to hell. Yet the Apoſtle telleth us, that <hi>they that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God:</hi> 
                                 <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 8.</note> but whether this Author thinks Heathens, to be amongſt the number of them that are in the fleſh, I know not. But I little wonder, when an Arminian ſpirit of gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe hath poſſeſſed him, if he proceed to the confounding not only of the Law with the Goſpell, but heatheniſme alſo (ſuch as might be) with Chriſtianity. But ſuppoſe a man might attaine to as much knowledge, by the meere contemplation of the book of nature, as we doe obtain by the Revelation of Gods word, yet we that conceive the knowledge of Gods word to be no impediment to the abſoluteneſſe of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt needs find our ſelves as much as nothing ſtreightned herein, by this Authors roaving diſcourſe, as touching the generall providence of God in his works: as long as that of the Apoſtle <hi>(he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth)</hi> ſhall ſtand <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 18.</note> and be received for the word of God; we ſhall never want ground for maintaining the abſoluteneſſe both of election by the one, and by juſt proportion, of Reprobation alſo
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56120:105"/>
by the other. For ſo long as God doth abſolutely, and according to the meere plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his will, decree to have mercy upon ſome, by giving them faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for the curing of their infidelity and hardneſſe of heart, this is very ſufficient to maintain the abſoluteneſſe of election unto grace, and if God doth abſolutely, and according to the meere pleaſure of his will decree, to harden others, by denying them the grace of faith and repentance, ſo to leave their naturall infidelity and hardneſſe of heart uncured, this ſhall be as ſufficient to maintaine the abſoluteneſſe of Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from grace. As for election unto ſalvation, though the decree thereof can admit no cauſe, yet we ſay that God by this decree, doth not decree to beſtow ſalvation on any man of ripe yeares, but by way of reward of faith, repentance, and good workes: as for the decree of Reprobation from glory, and to damnation; though the decree hath no cauſe, yet we ſay that God by this decree, doth not decree to inflict damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on any, but for ſinne unrepented of: only I confeſſe, that as touching the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of thoſe words of Saint <hi>Paul, (He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will</hi>

To you hath God ſent his Sonne Ieſus to bleſſe you in turning every one of you from your iniquityes [every one] that is, you that reject him, as well as you that receive him. The end of Chriſts coming then into the world was the Salvation of all and every one therein.</p>

Chriſt came into the World for the ſalvation of all, and every one. So the book of Gods creatures was given for the ſame end, namely, for the ſalvation of all and every one; and conſequently it followeth (ſeeing Gods wiſdome preſcribes congruous means to the end intended by him) that the book of the creatures, is a very congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous means for the ſalvation of all and every one. But whether this Author will have that knowledge of God revealed in the book of the creatures, tend only to this end, like as he ſaith, Chriſt came into the world, only to this end, I know not: Sure I am that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the inviſible things of God are made manifeſt from the creation in his</hi>

                              <p>In the next place he tells us poſitively, <hi>that Chriſt came not into the World, that he might be a rock of offence, at which the greater part of men might ſtumble and fall; but to ſhed his bloud, and by his bloudſhed to purchaſe ſalvation for all mankind,</hi> &amp;c. But this Antitheſis which here he makes, is ſtark naught; For this very ſhedding of his bloud, in a word <hi>Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> this very thing (I ſay) was it, that was both a <hi>Scandall to the Jewes, and fooliſhneſſe to the Gentiles.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. And that not only the <hi>greater part of men might ſtumble and fall at this rock of offence,</hi> but all and every one, I thought it had been without all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Nay undoubtedly all had ſtumbled, that is, had been taken with unbeliefe, if God in mercy had not provided better for them by the power of his grace. For dare any Arminian deny faith to be the gift of God? But was it not Gods will that not only the greater part might ſtumble, but that indeed they ſhould <hi>de facto ſtumble at this rock, and fall;</hi> and conſequently that Chriſt came into the World, with ſuch a purpoſe of God concerning them? I prove it thus; Firſt out of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 8. 14. <hi>He ſhall be as a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence to both the houſes of Iſrael, for a gin and for a ſnare to the inhabitants of Ieruſalem.</hi> 2. Againe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8. The Apoſtle profeſſeth, that <hi>To them who are diſobedient, Chriſt is made a ſtone to ſtumble at, and a rock of offence, being diſobedient:</hi> and addeth expreſſely, that <hi>hereunto they were ordained.</hi> 3. Thirdly, Did not God intend that they ſhould not be of God, as many as are not regenerated by him? If he did intend this, (and how can a man be of God, but by Gods making, and how is this poſſible to be done, without God his intending of it?) Then alſo he did intend <hi>they ſhould not heare Chriſts words, and conſequently, that they ſhould ſtumble at him; for therefore men heare not Chriſts words, becauſe they are not of God. Iohn</hi> 8. 47. Yet let him winne his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by argument, and weare it. But that out of <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 17. <hi>God ſent his Sonne into the world, not to condemne the world but that the world ſhould be ſaved by him,</hi> is a great deale too ſhort to make the Child a coate; likewiſe that <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 47. is of no farther extent. The terme <hi>World</hi> in each is an indefinite terme, and it is in a contingent matter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is equivalent only to a particular propoſition, and not to an univerſall; Had it been delivered not of the world only, but of all the world, nor ſo only, but of all men in the world? yet <hi>Proſper,</hi> ſo much inſiſted upon by this Author, hath provided to our hands a faire interpretation, namely, that all men in Scripture phraſe, is taken ſometimes for <hi>all the elect only.</hi> As <hi>De vocatione gent. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>Apparuit gratia ſalutaris Dei om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus hominibus, &amp; tamen miniſtri gratiae odio erant omnibus hominibus: habente quidem ſalutis ſuae damnum rebellium portione, ſed obtinente plenitudinis cenſum fidelium dignitate.</hi> And <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>Habet ergo populus Dei plenitudinem in electis &amp; praeſcitis at<expan>

And yet becauſe much is to be done for a quiet life, let us diſtinguiſh the benefits of Chriſts merits; Salvation we know is to be conferred on none of ripe yeares, but ſuch as believe and repent; and undoubtedly if all and every one ſhould believe and repent, all and every one ſhould be ſaved by him: on the other ſide, if not one ſhould believe and repent, not one ſhould be ſaved by him. But what doth this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor think of faith and repentance? Are theſe alſo benefits purchaſed unto us by the merits of Chriſt? This is the poynt that puts all the Arminians to their purgation. If they be ſo, then I demand, Whether Chriſt purchaſed theſe to be obtained by all and every one, abſolutely or conditionally? if abſolutely, then all and every one muſt have faith and repentance; and conſequently, all and every one muſt be ſaved: if on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conditionally, then let them name upon what condition the gift of faith is to be obtained, and let them look to it, how they avoyd the giving of grace according to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56120:106"/>
mens works, which in the phraſe of the Ancients, is the giving of grace according to mens merits. <hi>The ſonne of man came to ſeeke that which was loſt. Luk.</hi> 19. 10. We grant that; but when it is added, that is every man, we deny this: As for the reaſon added, for every man was loſt; put theſe propoſitions into a Syllogiſme, and ſee what ſtuffe it will make; thus, <hi>Chriſt came to ſave that which was loſt; every man was lost; therefore Chriſt came to ſave every man.</hi> Now let every young Sophiſter judge, whether here be not foure termes; had it been ſaid, that Chriſt came to ſave every one that is loſt, the place had been indeed alleadged to the purpoſe. It is alſo ſaid, I am not ſent but to the loſt <note place="margin">Math. 15. 24.</note> ſheepe of the houſe of Iſrael; let this be underſtood only as touching the exerciſing of Chriſts Miniſtry among them; for this Author (I ſuppoſe) will not ſay he was ſent to redeem them only; will it herehence follow, that ſeeing every one of them was loſt, therefore he exerciſed his Miniſtry unto every one of them? how improbable a thing is this? How much leſſe did he exerciſe his Miniſtry amongſt the twelve Tribes diſperſed in <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, &amp;c.</hi> Yet my former diſtinction may ſerve to accommodate the buſineſſe, and to cleare the truth, although we prove ſo liberall as to grant him his hearts deſire. Laſtly as touching that, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 26. <hi>To you hath God ſent his Sonne to bleſſe you, in turning every one of you from your iniquities; every one of you,</hi> that is, ſaith this Authors gloſſe, <hi>as well you that receive him, as you that receive him not.</hi> But let us not carry the matter in hugger mugger, without diſtinction. If this were the end of Chriſts coming into the world, then it was intended by ſome one or other, and that muſt needs be God; Now did God intend that they ſhould be turned from their iniquities abſolutely or conditionally? If abſolutely then all muſt be turned from them; if conditionally, then ſhew what that condition is; if faith, we willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant, that as many as believe ſhall be bleſſed, and turned from their iniquities. For Chriſt indeed dyed for this end, namely, <hi>to redeeme us from our iniquities, and to purge</hi> 
                                 <note place="margin">Titus 2. 14.</note> 
                                 <hi>us a peculiar people unto himſelfe zealous of good workes;</hi> But as for faith and repentance which is alſo a gift of Chriſt, Chriſt did not purchaſe this for all abſolutely, for if he did then all ſhould believe; if conditionally, then upon ſome work of man, and conſequently the gift and grace of faith, ſhall be beſtowed according unto mans works; which is expreſſe Pelagianiſme. To the contrary, that Chriſt died not for all; I prove thus: Firſt, the reaſon why none can lay any thing to the charge of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, is becauſe Chriſt died for them <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. If therefore Chriſt died for all, none can <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 33, 34.</note> lay any thing to the charge of a Reprobate, more then to the charge of Gods Elect. Secondly, Chriſt prayed only for thoſe who either did or ſhould believe in him; and for whom he prayed for them only he ſanctified himſelfe. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. And what is the <note place="margin">Iohn 17. 9, 19.</note> meaning of the ſanctifying of himſelfe for them, but that he meant to offer up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in Sacrifice upon the croſſe for them; as <hi>Maldonate</hi> confeſſeth, was the joynt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of all the Fathers, whom he had read. Thirdly, did he dye only for all then living, or which ſhould afterwards be brought forth into the World, or for all from the beginning of the world? If ſo, then he dyed for all thoſe that already were damned. Fourthly, if he dyed for them, then Chriſt hath made ſatisfaction for their ſinnes; and is it decent that any man ſhould fry in Hell, for thoſe ſinnes for which Chriſt hath ſatisfied? Laſtly, if Chriſt hath died for all, then hath he merited Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all; and ſhall any faile of that ſalvation which Chriſt hath merited for them? Is it decent that God the Father, ſhould deale with Chriſt his Sonne, not according to the exigence of his merits? If we had merited ſalvation for our ſelves would God in juſtice have denied it unto us? Why then ſhould he deny any man ſalvation, in caſe Chriſt hath merited ſalvation for him?</p>

The paſſage alleadged out of the ſuffrages of the Brittain Divines, is moſt aliene from the preſent purpoſe: For the Theſis of theirs, proceedeth of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of grace by the word, not of regeneration, but of conviction of all ſuch, who believe not, and continue impenitent; that through their own fault, they periſh for neglecting or contemning the Goſpell. <hi>In Eccleſia ubi, juxta promiſſum hoc Evangelii, ſalus omnibus offertur, ea eſt adminiſtratio gratiae, quae ſufficit ad convincendos omnes impenitentes &amp; incredulos, quod ſua culpa voluntaria, &amp; vel neglectu, vel contemptu Evangelii perierint, &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum beneficium amiſerint.</hi> And in the explication of this Theſis, they propoſe two things to be cleared. 1. <hi>That ſome meaſure of grace is ordinarily adminiſtred in the Ministry of the Goſpell; aliquam menſuram gratiae ordinarie in Miniſterio Evangelii adminiſtrari:</hi> and for proofe hereof alone, they alleadge this paſſage out of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59. <hi>ult.</hi> This is my cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them ſaith the Lord, <hi>My ſpirit which is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth: So that the word and ſpirit are joyned togeather al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies;</hi> but not alwaies to regenerate; but either to regenerate and bring to obedience, or to convict of diſobedience.</p>

the ſpirit, but yet this is rightly to be underſtood, to wit, of the ſpirit of adoption, for undoubtedly even the Miniſtry of the Law, is the Miniſtry of the Spirit alſo, but <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 2 Cor. 3. 9.</note> of the ſpirit of bondage, to hold men under feare: it is called the Miniſtry of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and the reaſon hereof I conceive to be, becauſe God doth not concurre with the Miniſtry of the Law, by the holy Spirit, to worke any man to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the condition of the Law, which is exact and perfect obedience: but thus he doth concurre with the Miniſtry of the Goſpell, namely, by his ſpirit, to work men to the performance of the condition thereof, which is faith in Chriſt, and true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, therefore the letter, to wit of the Law, is called a killing letter; but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell is joyned with a quickning ſpirit, and therefore <hi>Piſcator</hi> conceives, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell in this place is called by the name of the ſpirit. Soe then the Goſpell giveth life by the ſpirit which accompanyeth the Miniſtry thereof; but to whom? To all, as this Author ſuppoſeth? Nothing leſſe, the generall experience of the world doth manifeſt the untruth thereof. But this Author is ready to ſuppoſe (though not very forward to ſpeake out in this) that it would regenerate if men were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective to them ſelves. So then man muſt firſt performe ſome worke on his part, and then the ſpirit of the Goſpell doth regenerate them: as much as to ſay the grace of regeneration, is diſpenſed by God according to ſome work of man, which in plain termes <hi>Pelagius</hi> durſt not profeſſe, but joyned with others to anathematize it in the Synod of <hi>Palaſtine.</hi> Yet this Doctrine is the very <hi>Helena</hi> wherewith the Arminians are enamored.

And who were theſe <hi>ſome,</hi> but the elect, as elſewhere he ſignifies, ſaying, I endure all <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 10.</note> things for the elects ſake, called alſo the children of God. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. 51, 52. <hi>This he ſpake not of himſelfe, but being High-Prieſt that ſame yeare, he Propheſyed that Jeſus ſhould dye for that Nation, and not for that Nation only, but that he ſhould gather together in one, the children of God which were ſcattererd.</hi> This gathering was to be performed by <hi>the word the inſtrument, by Gods appoyntment, to make men new creatures:</hi> but upon whom ſhould it worke effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally? The Text plainly calleth them, and ſetts them forth unto us, by the name of Gods children. <hi>The ſame men</hi> (ſaith this Author) that is, our Brittaine Divines at the Synod of <hi>Dort, doe ſay out of Iohn.</hi> 15. 22. <hi>(If I had not come and ſpoken to them, they ſhould not have had ſinne, but now they have no cloake for their ſinne) it is evident that Chriſt in his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing did adminiſter ſo much inward grace as was ſufficient to convince thoſe that rejected the Goſpell of poſitive unbeliefe, and ſo to render them obnoxious to juſt puniſhment; Now hence this Author frames this inference, And conſequently (I ſay) ſo much as ſufficed by their good husbandry, to have converted &amp; ſaved them; For that grace leaves none unexcuſable which is inſufficient to convert them.</hi> Now to this I anſwer, If our Divines had acknowledged any ſuch conſequence to be juſt, they had a faire calling to make profeſſion of it at that time. But conſider we the reſt of their <hi>Theſis</hi> delivered in the ſame place. The firſt is this, <hi>Ex ſpeciali amore &amp; intentione tum Dei patris tum Chiſti, mortuus eſt Chriſtus pro electis, ut illis remiffionem peccatorum &amp; ſalutem aeternam reipſa obtineret, &amp; infallibiliter conferret.</hi> It was of the intention and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall love of God the Father and God the Sonne, that Chriſt ſhould dye for the elect, effectually to procure for them, and infallibly to conferre on them pardon of ſinne,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56120:108"/>
and ſalvation. The ſecond is this, <hi>Ex hoc eodem amore per &amp; propter meritum &amp; interceſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Chriſti dantur iiſdem electis fides, &amp; perſeverantia, caetera<expan>
                                       <am>

The third is this, <hi>Deus lapſi generis humani miſereatus, miſit filium ſuum qui ſeipſum dedit pretium redemptionis pro peccatis totius mundi;</hi> God having compaſſion on mankind fallen, ſent his Sonne who gave himſelfe, a price of redemption for the ſinnes of the whole World: this I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of the ſufficiency of the price given, whereby it comes to paſſe, that Chriſt is <hi>remedium univerſo generi humano applicabile:</hi> as I have received from the mouth of one of thoſe, and a principall one, in ſuch ſort, that if all the World ſhould believe, all the World ſhould be ſaved: now marke I pray, how they carry themſelves in the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Theſis, and what difference they put betweene Chriſts dying for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and his dying for others. <hi>Sic ergo pro omnibus mortuus eſt ut omnes &amp; ſinguli mediante fide poſſint virtute</hi>

The fourth Theſis. <hi>In hoc merito mortis Chriſti fundatur</hi> 
                                 <note place="margin">Mark. 16. 16.</note> 
                                 <hi>univerſale promiſſum Evangelicum juxta quod omnes in Chriſtum credentes remiſſionem peccatorum &amp; vitam aeternam conſequantur.</hi> In this merit of Chriſt, is founded that univerſall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Goſpell, according whereto all that believe in Chriſt ſhall obtaine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſinne, and everlaſting life. The fifth Theſis, Is that which this Author in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts upon, but prepoſterouſly applyed by him; the Theſis runs thus, <hi>In Eccleſia ubi juxta promiſſum hoc ſalus omnibus effertur, ea eſt adminiſtratio gratiae quae ſufficit ad convincendos omnes impoenitentes &amp; incredulos, quod ſuâ culpa voluntaria &amp; neglectu vel contemptu Evangelii perierint.</hi> Take the laſt Theſis in the laſt place. <hi>Non obſtante hoc pacto univerſali de ſalvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis credentibus, Deus nulle pacto aut promiſſo tenetur Evangelium aut gratiam ſalutiferam omnibus &amp; ſingulis communicare.</hi> Notwithſtanding this generall covenant of ſaving believers, God is not tied by any covenant or promiſe to communicate the Goſpell and ſaving grace to all and every one. And that he beſtowes it on ſome, paſſing by others, it is of divine mercy and liberty. But let us examine the ſobriety of the conſequence, which this Author makes: namely, that if <hi>the grace adminiſtred in the Goſpell, be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to convict them who reſiſt it of poſitive unbeliefe, then it is ſufficient alſo by their good Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry to convert them.</hi> Marke I pray the nature of grace here ſhaped thus, <hi>ſufficient by their good Husbandry</hi> (to wit, by the good Husbandry of the hearers) <hi>to convert them.</hi> Now wherein doth this converſion conſiſt? Surely in believing, for of unbeliefe they are convicted by the Goſpell, as many as contemne or neglect it: and hence he inferres, that it was ſufficient to convert them, which muſt be by the Antitheſis, to bring them to faith, provided that they (that is the hearers) play the good husbands in the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it; But what is it to play the good husbands? Theſe and ſuch like Phraſiolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, are the uſuall ſculking courſes of the Arminians, like the inke which the Fiſh <hi>Saepia</hi> caſts forth, that ſhe may thereby the better hide her ſelfe, and eſcape from the hands of the Fiſher. But certainly it muſt be ſome worke or other to be performed by the hearer, whereby he ſhall be brought to faith: therefore I ſay, it is either the worke of Faith it ſelfe, or ſome other worke preceding it: not of faith it ſelfe, for faith it ſelfe, cannot in reaſon be ſaid to be a worke, whereby a man is brought to faith. Secondly, herehence it followeth, that Mans good husbandry, being here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the worke of Faith it ſelfe, the act of Faith is hereby made the work of mans will, not of Gods grace: if ſome work preceding faith, whereupon faith is wrought by grace, it followeth that the grace of faith, is given according to mans works: this is the foule iſſue of their tenet, making faith either not at all the worke
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56120:108"/>
of God, or if wrought by God, to be wrought according to mans worke. And thus they ſhape the grace of God, conferring faith, not only towards Reprobates, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo towards the elect. Now obſerve I beſeech you, how our Brittaine Divines doe purpoſely reject this Doctrine in the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> art. 3. in their third Theſis, of thoſe which are rejected by them. The Theſis which they reject is, <hi>poſitis omnibus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae operationibus quibus Deus ad efficiendam hanc converſionem utitur, voluntatem hominis relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui in aequilibrio: velitne credere vel non credere convertete ſe ad Deum vel non convertere.</hi> All the operations of grace ſuppoſed, the will of man is left in an even ballance, whether he will believe or no, whether he will convert himſelfe to God or no: this is the very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of this Author, againſt which our worthy Divines diſpute there in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>If this were ſo, then it would follow that God by his grace, is not the principall cauſe of mans believing and converſion, but man by his free will rather: For in this caſe God ſhall not predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly worke mans converſion, but upon condition only, to wit, in caſe the will firſt move it ſelfe whereby the leſſe worke is given to God, and the greater worke to man, to wit in mans converſion.</hi> 2. <hi>Herehence it will follow that God gives no more grace to the Elect than to the Reprobate, and that the elect are not bound to be more thankefull to God than the non-elect, becauſe the worke of God in both is no other than to place the will in an even ballance.</hi> 3. <hi>The grace of converſion is given with an intention that it ſhall prove effectuall and to move, nay rather to bring man to the producing of the act of faith, in ſuch ſort, as it cannot be made in vaine; Haec gratia a nullo duro corde reſpuitur ideo quippe tribuitur ut cordis duritia primitus auferatur.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And ſeeing the good Husbandry of mans conſiſts in obedience to the Goſpell it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears hereby, that the grace they ſpeake of is no other than the Goſpell, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to repentance, and this we confeſſe is ſufficient in a certain kind, to wit, in the kind of inſtruction and exhortation: and is not this ſufficient to convict of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe as many as wilfully reſiſt it, and ſuch is the condition of all in hearing the Goſpell, to whom God gives not the grace of converſion, for as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi>

Phil.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Dat Deus nobis &amp; velle &amp; perficere.</hi> As for that which he diſcourſeth of Gods <hi>principall aime, that the Church of Iſraell ſhould bring forth good fruit:</hi> let us ſpeake plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not cheat our ſelves firſt, and then become impoſtors unto others: was it that which God did principally intend? Gods intentions are his decrees, now if God did decree they ſhould bring forth fruit <hi>de facto, who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> Nay take their own rules according to their doctrine of <hi>Scientia media.</hi> Why did God give them only ſuch a grace to move them unto fruitfulnes, which he foreſaw they would reſiſt? And refuſe to give ſuch grace, as he foreſaw would not be reſiſted, and that without all prejudice to their wills? Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anſwer unto this, for that God in the ſtorehouſe of his wiſdome hath ſuch courſes as being uſed, he foreſeeth infalliby that any ſin will be hindred, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi> acknowledgeth, as I have ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alleadged him. But we may ſafely ſay, 1. That God
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56120:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
intended it ſhould be their duty to bring forth fruit. 2. If he did farther intend that the Church of Iſrael ſhould <hi>de facto</hi> bring forth fruit, this he did bring to paſſe alſo: but withall let us conſider what the Apoſtle teacheth us, and take that along with us alſo, namely, <hi>that all are not Iſrael, that are of Iſrael;</hi> and ſo in his elect he effecteth this. 3. I doubt not but this is pronounced chiefely for the elects ſake, and though they are not as yet ſo fruitfull as they ſhould be, yet I nothing doubt, but this paſſionate expoſtulation, was a means to turne them to the Lord, that is, ſome of them: For God calls them not all at once, but ſome at one houre of the day, ſome at another. 4. It might be a means to bring others alſo, though not to true converſion, yet <hi>ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorem vitae emendationem.</hi> As for that of our Saviour over Jeruſalem <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 37. That is of another condition in two reſpects. Jeruſalem neither ſaw his teares, nor heard his bemoaning of it; but we heare of it, and read it in his word, and it is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effectuall with the elect of God, and others alſo; as the expoſtulation we read <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5. Secondly our Saviour was a man as well as God, and though the Sonne of God, yet made under the Law, and accordingly as much bound to deſire and endeavour the ſalvation of all amongſt whom he was ſent, as any Prophet, or Apoſtle, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Gods word. That in the 5. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 34. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that ye might be ſaved;</hi> What is the meaning thereof but this. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you,</hi> exhorting you to believe, that ye might be ſaved; according to that v. 24. <hi>He that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, and believeth him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, but hath paſſed from death to life:</hi> and by the words following, in the words alleadged by him it appears, that there is no other intention of ſalvation meant, than in caſe they believe: <hi>But ye will not come unto me that ye might have life,</hi> v. 40. And as before I ſaid, Chriſt being made under the Law, was bound, as well as we are, to deſire the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Brethren, that is to deſire and labour the converſion of thoſe to whom he was ſent, that ſo they might be ſaved.</p>

In which words are delivered two things. 1. The neceſſity of regeneration; (except a man be born again.) 2. The working cauſes of it, efficient, the Spirit of God, inſtrumentall, the Sacrament of Baptiſme, there called water from the outward mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it. Baptiſme therefore is appointed to be a means of regeneration to all thoſe that are Baptized, and doth effect it in all that doe not put an obſtacle in the way to hinder it.

I will ſhut up this with <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. 38. <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 26.</note> Where <hi>Peter</hi> ſayth, repent and be Baptized every one of you for the remiſſion of ſinnes: plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that therefore is Baptiſme ordained to be received that thoſe who doe receive it might have their ſinnes remitted.</p>
                           <p>The patience of God alſo, which is another ſingular donation and gift of God to men, is exerciſed to this very end, as appeares <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4.

But thou, after thy hardneſſe of heart that canſt not repent, heapeſt up &amp;c. In theſe words we may note for our purpoſe, 1. Gods end and intent in forbearing ſinners, and that is the leading of them to repentance, and ſo to Salvation, (for repentance is <hi>Per ſe ordinata ad ſalutem</hi> as a means to the end.) 2. The perſons to whom God intends this good by his forbearance, and they are ſuch as diſpiſe the riches of his goodneſſe, and have hard and impenitent hearts. 3. The iſſue and event of this theire contempt of Gods patience, and that is a treaſuring up wrath unto themſelves againſt the day of wrath. Out of all which laid togeher ariſeth thus much, That God by ſparing wicked men, who have hard and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent hearts, intends their everlaſting good, though they, by the abuſe of his patience, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall to repent, doe treaſure up to themſelues wrath and eternall miſery. The like to this is delivered in the 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 9. God is not ſlack, (as ſome men count ſlackneſſe) but patient toward us, that is, us men. And why patient towards us? Becauſe he would have none to periſh. The end therefore of Gods patience is mans repentance and Salvation.</p>

But whereas he talkes of a greater fulneſſe of grace in the Baptiſme of Chriſt, than in the Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn,</hi> this beliefe is one of his myſteries concerning Baptiſme. <hi>Iohn</hi> Preached Chriſt unto the people, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 4. And <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptiſme was the Baptiſme of repentance for the remiſſion of ſinnes, that is, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of repentance, he adminiſtred Baptiſme unto them in aſſurance of the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their ſinnes, upon their repentance. And therefore he put off the Scribes and Phariſes, calling upon them to bring forth fruits of repentance firſt. So <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes of the Baptiſme of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. Repent and be Baptized for the forgiveneſſe of your ſinnes. So was circumciſion unto the Jewes a Seale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, that is, of the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes through faith. It ſeems this Author is none of the Rhemiſts adverſary in this, who upon <hi>Math.</hi> 3. 11. writes thus. <hi>It is an Article of our adverſaries, that the Baptiſme of Chriſt, is no better then the Baptiſme of Iohn, they make it of no more value or efficacy for remiſſion of ſinnes, and grace, and juſtification than was Iohns: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fulke makes anſwer, ſaying, <hi>Remiſsion of ſinne is proper unto God as well in</hi> Iohns <hi>Baptiſme, as in the Baptiſme of Chriſt, and that</hi> Iohn <hi>in that place compares the Miniſtry of Man with the authority and power of God, and though ſome of the ancient Fathers were of another opinion, yet</hi> Saint Marke <hi>ſaith expreſſely, That</hi> Iohn <hi>Preached the Baptiſme of repentance. unto forgiveneſſe of ſinnes. And who can ſeparate forgiveneſſe of ſinnes from true repentance? When the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, at what time ſoever the ſinner repenteth, to pardon his ſinnes. The ſeale of Baptiſme alſo added to the doctrine of Repentance, muſt needs teſtify remiſſion of ſinnes, namely, the ſoule to be waſhed by mercy, as the body is with water. Neither doth this doctrine derogate any thing from the Baptiſme of Chriſt, ſeeing it is Chriſt that forgiveth ſinnes, and giveth grace in the Baptiſme mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by</hi> Iohn <hi>and miniſtred by his Apoſtles: For</hi> Iohns <hi>Baptiſme was by Gods inſtitution, not of</hi> Iohns <hi>deviſing.</hi>

                                 <hi>But ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctifyed, but ye are juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpirit of our God.</hi> Now I willingly confeſſe, that as many as are waſhed and ſanctified and juſtified by the ſpirit of God, have put on Chriſt, and are Baptized into his death, to the mortifying and crucifying the old man in them. And as by the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of the ſpirit we doe put on Chriſt, ſo are we united unto Chriſt, and have a communion with him in the benefits of his death. But as for the intention of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of water, I know none it hath, much leſſe doe I know how to put a difference between intention originall, and ſome other intention which he conceales, content to ſuffer the diſtinction, to fly with one wing. The Baptize is intention I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what acquainted with: On mans part, to Baptize ſuch as are brought to the font for that purpoſe, and by Baptiſme to conſecrate them to the ſervice of that God, who is one in nature, but three in perſons, Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt: on Gods part, to ſeale unto us the righteouſneſſe of faith, which I learne out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. In the deſcription of Circumciſion, and the meaning thereof, I take to be the aſſuring of forgiveneſſe of ſinnes to them that believe, and this is congruous to the deſcription both of <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme, and Chriſts Baptiſme ſet forth unto us in holy Scripture. As for that <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Except a man be borne of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot &amp;c.</hi> Maſter <hi>Fulke</hi> in his anſwer to the Rhemiſts on that verſe writes thus; <hi>It is not neceſſary in this place by Water, to underſtand materiall Water, but rather the purifying grace of Chriſt, as,</hi> cap. 4. v. 11. <hi>Whereof the waſhing with water in Baptiſme, is an outward ſigne and ſeale, which alſo is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med fire,</hi> Math. 3. 11. <hi>The water therefore in Baptiſme is not our regeneration properly, but a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament and ſeale thereof;</hi> Iſid. Origen. l. 7. cap. de Spiritu Sancto. <hi>Aliud eſt aqua Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti, aliud aqua quae ſignificat Spiritum Dei; aqua enim Sacramenti viſibilis eſt, aqua ſpiritus ſancti inviſibilis eſt, iſta abluit corpus, &amp; ſignificat quid ſit in anima, per illum autem ſpiritum Sanctum anima mundatur, &amp; ſaginatur.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Indeed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the words of our Saviour Chriſt are not properly of the externall Sacrament more then,</hi> Ioh. 6. <hi>Of the other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; except you eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, you have no life in you: whereas all Infants are excluded from that Sacrament, and conſequently ſhould be excluded from life, if the words were meant of the outward Sacraments. And the Fathers of the ancient Church, which thought Baptiſme was neceſſary, did likewiſe think the communion to be as neceſſary for Infants; as</hi> Auguſtine, Innocentius <hi>Biſhop of Rome, and all the Church of their time, for any thing we can gather by their writings. Finally, when the word of Water in this Text ſignifieth the purifying grace of Christ, rather than the outward element of Baptiſme, here can be no argument drawn out of this place, that Sacraments conferre grace of the worke wrought, but according to the diſpenſation of Gods ſpirit, who worketh according to his own pleaſure;</hi> as in this chap. v. 8. 1 Cor. 12. When this Author talkes of the neceſſity of regeneration, I doubt he conſiders not, that hence it followeth, that either all that dye unbaptized are damned, (for I preſume he ſpeaks of the neceſſity of it unto ſalvation,) or that many thouſands are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies regenerated without any Sacrament of regeneration. That the Spirit of God is the efficient cauſe of Regeneration, I think no Chriſtian doubteth; but this Author maketh the Baptizing with Water to be an efficient alſo, as when he ſaith, <hi>Baptiſme is appoynted to be a means of Regeneration to all that are Baptized, and not only ſo, but that it doth effect it alſo in all that doe not put an obſtacle in the way to hinder it.</hi> I acknowledge willingly that Baptiſme materiall, is an inſtrument, to wit, both as a ſigne &amp; as a ſeale: But that it is an inſtrument in any other kind of operation, than belongs to a ſigne and ſeale, I have not hitherto learned out of the word of God. And as I remember, <hi>Arminius</hi> was ſometimes challenged for Heterodoxy about the Sacraments; and withall, that his Apology was this, he never aſcribed any other efficacy unto the Sacraments, than is denoted under the tearmes of Signes and Seales; but no marvaile, if a degenerated condition hath ſeized on any, that ſuch <hi>proficiunt in pejus,</hi> and grow more and more degenerate. The phraſe uſed here in calling Baptiſme a means of regeneration, ſounds harſh in my eares, we commonly ſay, and it is the doctrine of our Catechiſme, <hi>that a Sacrament is an outward and viſible ſigne, of an inward and inviſible grace:</hi> now this grace in Baptiſme I take to be the grace of regeneration; and is it a decent expreſſion to ſay, that <hi>the ſigne of Regeneration is the means of Regeneration?</hi> As for <hi>Baptiſmus ſpiritus,</hi> the Baptiſme of the ſpirit, that is the very working of regeneration, but <hi>Baptiſmus flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi> the Baptiſme of water, that is the adminiſtration of the outward ſigne, and ſeale of the grace of regeneration. The word Preacheth forgiveneſſe of ſinnes to all that believe, ſo doth the Sacrament of Baptiſme; but the word Preacheth this to the eare, the Sacrament to the eye. The word aſſureth it, for it is Gods word, the Sacrament
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56120:110"/>
aſſures it, for it is Gods ſeale, but neither of theſe worketh the aſſurance without the ſpirit of God: and as for the working of Faith it ſelfe, I have read that Faith comes by hearing, I no where read that Faith comes by the being Baptized. And ſure I am when men of ripe yeares came to be Baptized, they were firſt <hi>Catechumini,</hi> then <hi>compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes,</hi> and none admitted unto Baptiſme, unleſſe the word had formerly brought them unto faith. The Apoſtle calls Baptiſme <hi>the laver of regeneration,</hi> by the Rhemiſts tranſlation, the fountain of regeneration, by the former Engliſh tranſlation, the <hi>waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of regeneration,</hi> by the laſt: but whereas this Author dignifies it with this title, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth effect regeneration in all that doe not put an obſtacle in the way to hinder it:</hi> if this Author ſhall prove it (while his head is hot,) we ſhall give that credence to it, as it deſerves; in the mean time, it ſtands for a bold affirmation; let him take his time to make it appeare to be ſound: the Rhemiſts upon the place have this note; <hi>As before in the Sacrament of holy Orders</hi> [1 Tim. 4. 2 Tim. 1.] <hi>So here it is plaine that Baptiſme giveth grace, and that by it, as by an inſtrumentall cauſe, we be ſaved.</hi> Maſter <hi>Fulkes</hi> anſwer is this, <hi>Here is no word to prove that Baptiſme giveth grace of the worke wrought, but the Apoſtle ſaith that God hath ſaved us by the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, which is teſtified by the Sacrament of Baptiſme</hi> (marke I pray the office of Baptiſme in Maſter <hi>Fulkes</hi> judgement, <hi>to teſtify the renewing,) which is Sacramentally the laver of regeneration; not by the worke wrought but by the grace of Gods ſpirit, by which we are juſtified. So ſpeaketh Saint Peter, and explicateth himſelfe</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Baptiſme ſaveth us not the waſhing of the fleſh of the body, but the interrogation of a good conſcience.</hi> And becauſe I know no obſtacle that an Infant can put to hinder the effect of it, for I ſuppoſe the obſtacle muſt be rationall, and Infants are not come to the uſe of reaſon, to performe any rationall act, which may prove any rationall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle; therefore it ſeems this Authors opinion is, that all who are Baptized in the Church, are regenerate: this indeed was the profeſſion of Maſter <hi>Mountague</hi> before he was Biſhop; and was anſwered by Biſhop <hi>Carelton,</hi> as touching the beſt firmament of his opinion; the Book of our Common-Prayer, where the Child Baptized is ſaid to be regenerate; that is to be underſtood <hi>Sacramento tenus,</hi> which is Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> phraſe, and which he diſtinguiſheth from <hi>truly regenerate:</hi> And Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Gotteſchaleus,</hi> alleadgeth out of the Author of the imperfect work upon <hi>Mathew, Hom.</hi> 5. this ſentence, <hi>Eos qui cum tentati fuerint, ſuperantur, &amp; pereunt, videri quidem filios Dei factos propter aquam Baptiſmatis, revera tamen non eſſe filios Dei, quia non ſunt in Spiritu Baptizati.</hi> As alſo out of <hi>Auſtin De Unitate Eccleſiae, cap.</hi> 19. <hi>Viſibilem Baptiſmum poſſe habere, &amp; alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos qui regnum Dei non poſſidebunt: ſed eſſe donum Spiritus Sancti quod proprium eorum eſt tantum qui regnabunt cum Chriſto in aeternum.</hi> And laſtly out of the ſame <hi>Auſtin,</hi> as he is alleadged by <hi>Peter Lombard, l.</hi> 4. <hi>Sent. diſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Sacramenta in ſolis electis efficere quod figurant.</hi> All this is to be found in that Book of Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> p. 188. Beſides many more pregnant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages are collected by him for the ſame purpoſe. And not to charge him with authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty only, but with ſome reaſon; when Saint, <hi>James</hi> ſaith <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Of his own will he hath begotten us by the word of truth;</hi> what I pray is here meant by <hi>the word of truth?</hi> Is it not the Goſpell, to wit, The Preaching of Chriſt crucified? Now conſider to whom doth he write, but to the twelve Tribes, that is, to the Chriſtian Jewes, <hi>ſuch as were begotten to a lively hope by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes writing alſo to the Jewes. If then theſe Jewes were regenerated by the Preaching of the Goſpell, ſurely they were not regenerated by Circumciſion; and if regeneration were not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily annexed to the Sacrament of Circumciſion, amongſt the Jewes, then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it neceſſarily affixed to the Sacrament of Baptiſme amongſt the Chriſtians. For our Divines doe uſually maintaine againſt the Papiſts, that the Sacraments of the Old Teſtament, were as effectuall to the Jewes, as the Sacraments of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are effectuall unto us Chriſtians. It is true, Baptiſme is ordained, <hi>that thoſe which doe receive it may have the remiſſion of their ſinnes,</hi> but not abſolutely, but conditionally, to wit, in caſe they believe and repent, as appears both in that place, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. And Baptiſme as a Seale doth aſſure hereof, only in caſe they believe and repent; and therefore none of ripe years were admitted unto Baptiſme, untill they made profeſſion of their faith, and as for Infants, they were alſo anciently ſaid to be Baptized <hi>in fide Parentum.</hi>

Then he would afford them efficacious grace, to heale them, as he promiſeth <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57. 18. Then would he rule them with <hi>a mighty hand, and make them paſſe under the rodde, and bring them unto the bond of the covenant.</hi> So then to the poynt in particular here obſerved. 1. God leads all to repentance by his goodneſſe, manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in his forbearance and long ſuffering, by way of admonition, that it is their duty to turne unto God by repentance, while he gives them time and ſpace for repentance. 2. But as for thoſe whom he hath elected, he not only thus leads, but alſo effectually brings them to repentance, in the time he hath appoynted, before which time they are found ſometimes to deſpiſe the riches of his goodneſſe, and to have hard and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent hearts, as much as any Reprobate: who more foule in the committing of horrible abominations than <hi>Manaſſes?</hi> Who more furious in perſecuting the Church of God then <hi>Saul?</hi> Yet God took away the ſtony heart (and what is harder then ſtone) out of their bowells, and ſo he doth to all whom he regenerates. 3. As touching a finall contempt of Gods patience, that is peculiar unto Reprobates; as for the elect, though ſome are called at the firſt houre of the day, ſome not till the laſt, yet all are effectually called, before they drop out of the World. To ſay that God intends the everlaſting good of Reprobates, is to deny the firſt Article of our Creed, even Gods omni potency, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath diſputed 1200 years agoe; we find in our ſelves, that whatſoever we will doe, if we doe not it, it is either becauſe we cannot doe it, or becauſe our will is changed, but to aſcribe either mutability or impotency to God, is intollerable in a Chriſtian, and it cannot be denied, but God did from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting intend their everlaſting damnation: ſo that to ſay he did intend their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting good, is flat contradiction; neither is there any way to charme it, but by ſaying, God intends their everlaſting good conditionally; but to intend it after ſuch a manner, is apparently no more to intend their ſalvation than their damnation, nay leſſe rather; conſidering the conditions of ſalvation are utterly impoſſible unto man, unleſſe God correct, and cure his corrupt nature; but this grace he diſpenſeth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meere pleaſure of his will, as the Apoſtle ſignifyeth in ſaying, <hi>he hath mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth.</hi> As for that 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>He is patient towards us, not willing</hi>

The Reprobates are adorned with many of thoſe graces, as apears plainly by many Scriptures, eſpecially <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 4. Where the Apoſtle ſayes, that it is impoſſible for thoſe that have been enlightned, taſted the heavenly gift, been made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they fall away, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by repentance: and the graces which the Apoſtle ſpeakes of here, are not ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but ſpeciall graces, illumination, faith, reliſh of the ſweetneſſe of Gods Word, and the taſt of Heaven. The perſons ſpoken of, are Apoſtates, ſuch as are under the poſſibility of falling away, (for upon a dainger not poſſible cannot be built a ſolid exhortation) and if Apoſtates then Reprobates, and the thing intimated is that upon Apoſtates and Reprobates are theſe gifts beſtowed.

For they never ſeriouſly repent, they are never affected with hearty ſorrow for offending God by ſinning, nor doe they come to any humble contrition of heart, nor conceive a firme reſolution to offend any more.</hi> And whereas he ſaith, that ſuch doe prove Reprobates in the end, he may as well ſay of others, that they prove elect in the end, which doth wholly ſavour, of ſhapeing the decrees of God, to be of a temporall condition, and not eternall; unleſſe he delivers it of the manifeſtation of

it in the judgement of men, which yet as touching Reprobates cannot appeare untill their death, and 'tis a very hard matter for any man, to paſſe upon men generally the cenſure of elect, or reprobates; the hypocriſy of man hath ſuch power to evacuate the one, and the ſecret operation of Gods mercy and grace the other. How farre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates may attain to the illunination of their mind, and renovation of their wills, and reformation of their lives, is ſet downe more fully by our Brittain Divines in the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> than by this Author; not one particular (if I miſtake not) being mentioned here, as touching the places of Scripture, containing the indication there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which is not ſet downe there, and ſome there are ſet downe, which are not ſet downe here.

Now ſeeing God brings them no farther, as he doth his elect; with what ſobriety can it be ſaid, that God intends their ſalvation?

Nay, no Arminian denies, but that God did from everlaſting intend the ſalvation of all ſuch Apoſtates; and to ſay that he had a velleity to ſave them, is to daſh a mans ſelfe againſt the rock of abſurdity, as to deny Gods omnipotency, unleſſe he will ſay Gods mind is changed: and to talke of a conditionate will intending their ſalvation, is no more to ſay, that he intends their ſalvation in caſe they doe believe, than to ſay, he intends their damnation in caſe they doe not believe. And as for his allegation out of the ſuffrages of our Divines in the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> that is very wild, neither mentioning the Article, nor rightly quoting the page: though the things here propoſed are moſtly taken out of the firſt and ſecond Theſis, concerning the <hi>Non-elect,</hi> upon the fifth Article: but no glimps doe I find there, of any ſuch end of Gods granting theſe diſpoſitions, as that thereby they might be brought unto ſalvation; though as in the elect ſuch like diſpoſitions are, ſo in the Reprobate, they might be preparations to farther grace, if it pleaſed God ſo to ordaine as to bring them on forward to juſtification and true ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conjunct therewith, and thereby unto ſalvation.</p>
                              <p>As for the ends which God doth intend thereby, to wit, by bringing them ſo farre; look whatſoever God doth bring to paſſe hereby, that God doth intend.

I preach Chriſt (ſayth <hi>Paul)</hi> to the Jewes a ſtumbling blocke. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. We are the ſweet ſavor of death unto death: and it ſeems by theſe places, that God gives theſe things to ſome, that they may ſtumble, and be left without excuſe; What ſhall we ſay therefore to theſe places? Of all theſe Scriptures in generall, I may ſay this, that they are to be underſtood of the end, which is many times effected by theſe gifts of God, and not of the end that is primarily intended in them; and they ſhew what Chriſt, the Word Preached, and the gifts of nature and grace, are (occaſionally) to ſome men through their voluntary rebellion againſt God, and his Ordinances; and not what they are (intentionally) in Gods firſt thoughts and reſolutions. He intends them for them, for their good, though many times they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them to their hurt: it is with Gods Ordinances and gifts (and that very often too) as it is ſometimes with Phyſick, it is given by the Phyſitian for the Patients good, many times through the diſtemper of his body, it doth him hurt. And as it is with the Sunne, God intends by the ſhining of it, the enlightning and clearing of men, and other creatures in this inferior World, others are hurt by the light of it, (accidentally) by reaſon of the climates wherein they live, or the ill affectedneſſe of their eyes and bodies. So the bleſſings of God, which out of his abundant goodneſſe, are beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon men for their eternall good, through the ill frame and temper of their heart, doe effect their hurt; partly becauſe lighting upon naughty hearts, they looſe their force and edge, (for <hi>quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis;)</hi> and partly becauſe of the ſeverity of God, who as he hath an antecedent and gratious will to doe men good, ſo he hath a conſequent and judicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will of giving up wicked men to the luſts of their hearts, and of permitting them to daſh

                              <p>THe gifts of grace he ſpeakes of are three. 1. The knowledge of God revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his workes, 2. Chriſt, 3. The Goſpell; for theſe alone are they, whereof the objection proceeds, which he propoſeth to be anſwered. Of the firſt: it is moſt true, that the end thereof repreſented in the objection, is effected by it, to wit, the bereaving men of excuſe, as namely in a certain kind, which <hi>Auſtin</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth, <hi>De grat. &amp; lib. arb. c.</hi> 2. in this manner, <hi>Quomodo dicit inexcuſabiles niſi de illa ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſatione, qua dicere ſolet humana ſuperbia ſi ſciſſem feciſſem, ideo non feci, quia neſcivi.</hi> How doth he call them inexcuſable, but in reſpect of ſuch an excuſe, which the pride of man moveth him to uſe, ſaying, had I known it I would have done it, therefore I did it not, becauſe I knew it not: thus the Gentiles were left without excuſe, in turning the glory of the incorruptible God, to the ſimilitude of the image of a corruptible man, &amp;c. And for as much as he had ſufficiently manifeſted himſelfe by his workes, to be eternall, and conſequently uncorruptible. So that knowledge ſufficiently revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, doth alwaies take away the pretence of ignorance for a mans excuſe, whether a man have any need of excuſe, as in caſe he lives not anſwerable to his knowledge, or no need at all to excuſe himſelfe, as in caſe he doth conforme himſelfe to that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which God hath given him, in which caſe he is not ſaid to be inexcuſable, though pretence of ignorance by way of excuſe is taken from him, as well as from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but becauſe he hath no need of any ſuch excuſe, as depends upon pretence of ignorance, therefore he is not denominated inexcuſable, but ſuch only who would excuſe themſelves by ſuch a pretence, but cannot. But as touching the other gifts of grace mentioned, to wit, 1. Chriſt, 2. The Goſpell, 'tis moſt untrue that the end ſpecified, is effected by them: for Chriſt doth not effect the falling of any; neither is the <hi>ſetting of him up,</hi> any cauſe of any mans falling, neither is the ſtumbling of any, effected by the Preaching of the Goſpell; for what is mens ſtumbling thereat, but their diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereunto. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8. Now the Goſpell doth not effect any mans diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but the corrupt heart of man alone is the efficient cauſe thereof. And I cannot ſufficiently wonder, at ſo crude a conceit as this Author manifeſteth, by ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate an expreſſion. I grant the end primarily intended, was no other then Gods glory: But as for the ſalvation of Reprobates, that is neither primarily nor ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, nor at all intended by God, as I have often demonſtrated; both in as much as God hath from everlaſting intended their damnation, and therefore cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction intend their ſalvation. And withall God is unchangeable and omnipotent, and therefore as he can procure the Salvation of any, if withall he intends and wills to procure it, undoubtedly ſuch a one ſhall be ſaved. Againſt all which, this Author proceeds without taking any courſe to charme thoſe foule abſurdities whereinto he precipitates himſelfe. And when he ſaith of the ſtumbling of many at the Goſpell, that it is not <hi>primarily intended,</hi> he doth moſt inconſiderately confeſſe, that it is intended by God, though not primarily, which is enough for us; and the Apoſtle is expreſſe, profeſſing of ſuch who ſtumble at the word through diſobedience, <hi>That thereunto they were ordained.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8. Neither doe we ſay that the Goſpell or Chriſt, is the cauſe of any mans falling; but onely
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56120:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the occaſion thereof: mans corrupt heart alone (as formerly I ſaid) being the cauſe thereof. But God intends their ſtumbling ſhall come to paſſe, which muſt needs be, in caſe it is through diſobedience that they ſtumble, and God hath purpoſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them the grace of obedience, as indeed he hath to many, like as he doth deny it to many; as appeareth by his hardening of many, even whom he will, like as on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, he hath mercy on whom he will. So Chriſts carriage was not the cauſe, but the occaſion only of the Jewes plotting againſt him, becauſe <hi>they obſerved that he did many miracles, and if they let him alone, all men would believe in him, and the Romans would come and take away both their place, and the Nation. Ioh.</hi> 11. 47, 48. Yet look what they did againſt him, God had before intended and determined to be done; <hi>For both Herod, and Pontius Pilate together with the Gentiles, and people of Iſraell, were gathered together, to doe what Gods hand and counſell had determined before to be done. Acts</hi> 4. 28. Yet not primarily inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded neither, for all this was to a farther end, namely, to procure the redemption of the World, yea of ſome of them who crucified him. Yet there was a farther end than all this, namely, the glory of God, in the way of mercy mixt with juſtice, and that brought to paſſe by admirable power and wiſdome. This was firſt in Gods thoughts and reſolutions, as the ſupreame end, all the reſt were but as meanes tending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: yet doe we not ſay <hi>this was intentionally in Gods firſt thoughts and reſolutions,</hi> which is as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>intentionally in Gods intentions;</hi> and with the like genius of ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he diſtinguiſheth between <hi>occaſionally</hi> and <hi>intentionally,</hi> incloſing the tearmes with a parentheſis, as if there were ſome great judgement, though little wit, in this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore would have it obſerveable. Occaſion is juſtly diſtinguiſhed from a cauſe, but I never found it diſtinguiſhed from intention, till now. It ſeemes he would ſay accidentally or caſually, for ſuch alone are <hi>praeter intentionem,</hi> if any, and ſo fit to be oppoſed to <hi>intentionally;</hi> but this diſtinction ſticks in his teeth, he was loath in plaine tearmes to expreſſe ſo ſhamefull an opinion, as to profeſſe that any thing comes to paſſe in the World, beſides Gods intention, which is the diſtinction of things fortuitous in <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Nay, he leaves place for Gods intention of them <hi>ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily,</hi> denying only that he intends them primarily. But ſtill he keepes this concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and holds that up, whatſoever becomes of his premiſes, as when he ſaith <hi>God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends them for them, for their good,</hi> that is his Oracle; but Saint Pauls Oracle is, that <hi>the inviſible things of God, that is his eternall power and Godhead, are ſeen by the Creation of the World being conſidered in his workes,</hi>

Was it Salvation? And how did he intend that unto them? Was it intended to be their portion, whether they believed in Chriſt or no? Undoubtedly his meaning can be no other then this, he intended they ſhould be ſaved by him, provided they did believe in him: Now what Chriſtian was there ever known to deny this, namely, that as many as believed in Chriſt, ſhould be ſaved by him? But let me aske another queſtion, Did God intend they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him? Yes ſurely in the opinion of this Author: but is not faith the gift of God? They are aſhamed to deny this, at leaſt <hi>in concione populi,</hi> whatſoever they doe <hi>conſeſſu familiari.</hi> Why then did not God give them faith? Why ſurely becauſe they refuſed to believe in him, ſo that had they believed in him, then God would have given them faith; as much as to ſay, had they beſtowed faith on themſelves, then God would have beſtowed faith on them: this is their ſobriety that oppoſe the grace of God, and ſuch be their ſobriety ſtill that fall away from the truth of God.

ſtuck in the way, like a burre in his throat, as when he ſaith <hi>that God intends the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men by the ſhining of the Sunne,</hi> but that ſome are ſcorched by the heat of it, ſome hurt by the light of it, is accidentally, as if theſe effects were not intended by God; as much as to ſay, that God doth not intend, that the ſunne ſhould ſcorch <hi>in Zona torri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> though the ſunne works by neceſſity of nature, and cannot but ſcorch there, as the <hi>Abiſſines</hi> felt to their ſmart, who were wont to pray unto the ſunne as he was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſpare them, but after he was paſſed, and going downe, to curſe as faſt for his ſcorching of them, whence it is conceived that proverbe came, <hi>plures adorant ſolem orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem quam occidentem:</hi> as naturall it is to the light to ſcatter the ſight, and if by ſcattering the eye be ill affected, this is as naturall to the ſunne; like as to make ſweet flowers ſend forth their odoriferous ſavours, as a dung-mixen, to exhale an unſavoury ſmell: but ſuppoſe a man ſhould looſe his ſight by the light, as ſome have by the light of the ſunne, being kept long in ſome darke place before, ſhall this be accidentall unto God, wheras the Prophet profeſſeth, <hi>there is no evill in the City which the Lord hath not done?</hi> Like as Gods bleſſing it is, that neither the ſun ſcorcheth him by day, nor the influence of the Moon, or any other planet, hurt him by night. But come we to the Apodoſis of the ſimile, He renewes his cocciſmes of <hi>Gods bleſſings out of his abundant goodneſſe, beſtowed on men for their good;</hi> which is a generall ſpeech, and in the generality nothing to the preſent purpoſe, we know <hi>God ſaveth both man and beaſt,</hi> he makes his ſunne to ſhine, and his raine to fall on the juſt and on the unjuſt, but as for the knowledge of God revealed in his creature, whatſoever is brought forth according to it, we doubt not but God intended it, as civill ſociety, and ſome naturall feare of God, and civill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; where any thing is done contrary unto it, the Apoſtle hath diſcovered unto us, the end of naturall revelation is, <hi>that they might be without excuſe;</hi> they connot ſay, <hi>ſi ſciſſem feciſſem,</hi> that excuſe is taken from them. As for the dictates of ſupernumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Apoſtles, we have no cauſe to regard them, eſpecially when they are cantradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the word of God, and Chriſtian reaſon, the Goſpell is unto God throughout a ſweet ſavour in Chriſt, <hi>both in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh;</hi> It is true, that it is through the corruptions of mens hearts, that men doe not yeeld obedience to it, but that corruption God can cure, and doth cure where it pleaſeth him; that men doe obey, 'tis alſo through the good temper of their hearts, but through the grace of God, curing that corruption in them, that he leaves uncured in others; And we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly grant, that he intends their ſalvation in whom he means to cure this corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to bring them to the obedience of faith: but moſt abſurd it is to ſay, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends their ſalvation, on whom he never meant to ſhew any ſuch mercy, but rather to harden them; where the honeſt and good heart is wanting, the word proves not fruitfull, but only where ſuch an heart is found. Now it is Gods work, (I know) alone to take away the ſtony heart, and to give an heart of fleſh. But this Author car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth himſelfe ſo throughout, that he would have this worke to be the work of mans free will, not of God, any other way than by perſwaſion, admonition, exhortation, and concourſe; many talke of <hi>Robin Hood</hi> that never ſhot in his Bow; and this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor talkes of the anticedent will of God, which I doubt whether he underſtands either the meaning of <hi>Damaſcen</hi> herein, or of <hi>Cryſoſtom</hi> either <hi>Voſſius</hi> reduceth it as I have ſhewed before, to <hi>Voluntas conditionata,</hi> thus, God willeth that men ſhould be ſaved if they believe, is it not as true, that his will is, they ſhall be damned if they doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? this is the only gratious will this Author magnifyes; but God give me experience of another manner of his gratious will towards me, namely, as he ſeeth my wayes, ſo to heale them, yea, and to rule me with a mighty hand, ſo he make me to paſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rod, and bring me unto the bond of his covenant. But yet ſee I pray whether this Author be yet come to the ſobriety of his ſences, in ſpeaking here of Gods ſeverity in the way of a <hi>will judiciary;</hi> as when <hi>he gives wicked men up to the luſt of their hearts, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them to daſh againſt Chriſt, and other meanes of eternall life,</hi> Now I pray conſider, who are thoſe wicked men whom God thus gives over to their luſts? Were we not all ſuch? Did not God find us all weltering in our bloud. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.? Had not we all ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hearts. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.? Were we not all blind, lame, deafe, nay were we not dead in ſinnes. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1.? Did not the Goſpell find the <hi>Epheſians</hi> ſo? Did not the Word of truth find the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſo? <hi>James,</hi> 1. 18. How then comes this difference that Chriſt is a ſtumbling blocke to ſome and not to others? We ſay the difference is, becauſe God hath mercy on ſome, and hardens others. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. Becauſe ſome are borne of God, therefore they heare Gods Word, others are not borne of God, and therefore they
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56120:114"/>
heare not Gods word. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 47. The Arminians ſay <hi>God giveth power to every one by an univerſall grace to will any good whereto he ſhall be excited.</hi> So when the Goſpell is Preached, every one hath power to obey it: if he doth obey it, then Chriſt is a precious ſtone to him, but if it diſobey it, then he is given up to the luſts of his heart, and <hi>permitted to daſh againſt Chriſt, and other meanes of eternall life.</hi> Here we have a phraſe, but we are to ſeeke of the meaning thereof; what is it to daſh againſt Chriſt? It muſt needs be to commit ſome ſinne or other, for that is the object of Gods permition, for of all other things God is acounted the Author, not the permitter, the object of permition is nothing but ſinne, now what ſinne can that be, whereby we are ſaid to daſh againſt Chriſt, and other meanes of ſalvation, but diſobedience to Chriſt and to the meanes of grace: ſo that from the firſt to the laſt, the ſence comes to this, as many as diſobey Chriſt and the meanes of grace, they are given over to the luſts of their hearts, and permitted to daſh againſt Chriſt and other means of eternall life, that is, are permitted to diſobey Chriſt and to reſiſt other means of eternal life. So that their diſobedience to Chriſt and the Goſpell is very punctually and juditiouſly ſet downe to precede by two degrees their diſobedience to Chriſt, and his Goſpell. Some may thinke that this Arminian proſilite doth not carry himſelfe well in his buſineſſe and for betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nakedneſſe of his cauſe may be in dainger to be excommunicated out of their Synagogue. But Sir you muſt believe it, this is the very leproſy of their Doctrine that over ſpreds it from the crowne of the head to the ſole of the foot, and they are in love with it, accounting it not only ſanity, but perfect beauty. God indeed is ſaid in Scripture, to give men over to their luſts, when he forbears either courſes of admonition and reproofe by his word, or by his judgements in his workes, or when he forbears to reſtraine Satan, as formerly he did: but diſobedience to the Goſpell undoubtedly is, <hi>hoc ipſo,</hi> a daſhing againſt Chriſt, although God may continue to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh and exhort even to the end; as to prophane and hypocriticall perſons in the Church, he gives not over this courſe of his untill the end. I have often repreſented the abſurdity of this Authors conceit, <hi>of a gracious intent in God, of promoting the eternall good of Reprobates;</hi> whereas it cannot be denied, that God hath from everlaſting intended their damnation: and as for our ſaying, that God intends they ſhall be without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, that Chriſt is ſet up for their falling, that the Goſpell <hi>is unto God a ſweet ſavour in Chriſt, not only in them that are ſaved, but in them that periſh.</hi> This Author is ſo farre from overthrowing the truth of it, that (beſides other abſurdities delivered by him in the way) the Author himſelfe hath no heart to deny it, only ſaying, that <hi>God intends it not primarily,</hi> which is rather to grant that he intends it (though not primarily as whereabouts there is no queſtion) than to deny it, and that <hi>occaſionally they are ſo;</hi> whereas no man but himſelfe hath ſaid (in ſaying that they doe effect this end) that Chriſt or the Goſpell are the cauſe hereof, but only that they are the occaſion. But this hinders not Gods intention of them: For undoubtedly God intends as well things occaſioned as things cauſed, though not in his firſt thoughts and reſolutions, which belongs rather to the end than to the meanes, to wit, to be firſt intended. So that in plaine tearmes, he hath not hitherto dared to deny, that God intends them, though he manifeſts a good mind to maintaine, that they come to paſſe accidentally and caſually in reſpect of God; For he ſpares not to profeſſe, that the ſcorching of men, and the hurting of weake eyes falls out accidentally, and that to God; for he propoſeth this by way of diſtinction, from that which God intends, which he ſaith is the chearing of men by the light of the Sunne: like as here he denies that mens ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at Chriſt, is a thing intended by God; like as in ſaying a <hi>ſinnefull event is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly under Gods will and decree, but under his preſcience only, or at moſt under a permiſſive decree.</hi> And this I confeſſe, is a very plauſible doctrine in the judgement of fleſh and bloud; ſave that this Authors faint carriage in the delivering of it, is enough to make a man ſuſpect it, as plauſible as it is, yet it is hardly true and ſound. For he dares not ſay, <hi>that a ſinfull event is not at all under Gods decree,</hi> only that he ſaith, <hi>it is not properly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods decree.</hi> But Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of them that ſtumbled at the word of God through diſobedience, profeſſeth in plaine termes, that hereunto they were ordained, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 6. And all the Apoſtles there aſſembled. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 28. Doe profeſſe, <hi>that both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and people of Iſraell, were gathered together against the Holy Sonne of God, to doe what Gods hand, and Gods counſell had determined before to be done.</hi> And ere I part I hope to prove, that any ſinfull act that comes to paſſe in the world, is as properly intended of God, as any good act whatſoever, although there be a vaſt
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56120:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
difference in the bringing of them forth: God cauſing the one, &amp; only permitting the other as it is evill. And that becauſe it comes under Gods preſcience, &amp; it is well they are not ſo Atheiſtical as to deny Gods preſcience; but I doubt not to make it good, that either they muſt deny that every thing comes under Gods preſcience, or they muſt grant that every thing comes under Gods decree. For conſider, nothing can be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne of God as future, unleſſe it be future. Now let us quietly enquire how any thing becomes future, and if any cauſe hereof can with reaſon be deviſed without the decree of God, let us all become Arminians, and deny God either at all to be, or to be a free agent, but working by neceſſity of nature: For if future things be future of their own nature, then all things muſt be acknowledged to come to paſſe by neceſſity of their owne nature, which is to deny God. But if things be of their owne nature meerly poſſible, and indifferent to become either <hi>future</hi> or <hi>non-future,</hi> then there muſt be acknowledged ſome cauſe whereby they are brought out of the condition of things meerly poſſible, into the condition of things future. And this cauſe muſt exiſt from everlaſting, otherwiſe it ſhould not be ſo ancient as the effect thereof, for it is well knowne that all things future have been future from everlaſting, otherwiſe God could not have foreknown them from everlaſting: but all confeſſe that God from everlaſting foreknew every future thing; Therefore the cauſe making them to paſſe out of the condition of things meerely poſſible (ſuch as they were of their owne nature) into the condition of things future, was alſo from everlaſting. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider where was this cauſe to be found? Not without God: for nothing without God either was or is everlaſting without beginning; therefore is it to be found within God or no where. Conſider in the next place, what is that within God which is fit to be the cauſe hereof. We ſay 'tis his decree, but this Author cannot away with that. Therefore <hi>Si quid noviſti rectius iſto candidus imperti.</hi> Certainly the knowledge of God cannot be the cauſe; for as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith, that cauſeth nothing but as joyned with Gods will, and therefore it is commonly conceived that foreknowledge doth rather preſuppoſe things future than make them ſo: nothing then remaines to be the cauſe hereof, but the eſſence of God. Now the eſſence of God may be conſidered two waies, either as working neceſſarily, or as working freely: if it be the cauſe of things future as working neceſſarily, then it followeth that God ſhall produce them by neceſſity of nature, which utterly overthrowes Divine providence. What remaines then but that we muſt be driven to confeſſe that Divine eſſence makes them future, as work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freely, which is as much as to profeſſe, that Gods will and decree is that alone, which maketh things to paſſe out of the condition of things meerly poſſible in to the condition of things future. And I challenge the whole Nation of Arminians, and Jeſuites to anſwer this argument. Yet this decree we willingly acknowledge is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive decree: but look that we underſtand that aright alſo; thus God decreeth this or that evill to come to paſſe by his permiſſion, like as good things he decreeth ſhall come to paſſe by his effection: and that upon Gods permiſſion, it is neceſſary that that which he permits ſhal come to paſſe, is acknowledged not only by our Divines, but by <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> by Arminians, by <hi>Navarettus</hi> the <hi>Dominican</hi> as I have quoted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in my <hi>Vinditiae gratiae Dei,</hi> which yet they deliver without clear expreſſing how: which I perform thus, look what God decrees to permit, it is neceſſary that it ſhould come to paſſe, but how? Not neceſſarily but contingently &amp; freely, And the Scripture is expreſſe as before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that the moſt barbarous actions co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mited againſt Chriſt by <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilate,</hi> together with the Gentiles and people of Iſraell, in their contumelious uſages of him, were all predetermined by the hand and counſell of God. Marke the iſſue of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors moſt frivolous diſcourſes: for this will whereof he ſpeakes, whereby God is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended gratiouſly to will mans Salvation, conditionall; as much as to ſay, 'tis Gods will that a man ſhall be Saved in caſe he believe in Chriſt; now what Chriſtian was ever known to deny this. Secondly, conſider whether this deſerves to be called a will to ſave more than a will to damne, for like as 'tis certaine a man ſhall be ſaved if he believe in Chriſt, ſo it is moſt certaine a man ſhall be damned if he believe not, and withall conſider to which of theſe the nature of man is moſt prone, whether to faith or to infidelity.</p>

                           <p>BUt by this opinion the gifts of nature and grace have another end, either God doth not meane them unto thoſe that periſh, albeit they doe enjoy them; becauſe they are mingled in the world with the elect, to whom only they are directed: or if he doe, he meaneth they ſhall have them, and by them be lifted up above the common rank of men, <hi>[ut lapſu graviore ruant]</hi> that their fall may be the greater: for how can God intend that thoſe men ſhould receive them or any good by any of them, whom he hath by an abſolute decree cut off and rejected utterly from grace and glory. More particularly by, this doctrine,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Chriſt came not into the world to procure the Salvation of them that periſh, becauſe they were inevitably preordained to periſh.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The word is not ſent to them, or if it be, it is that they might ſlight it or contemne it and increaſe their damnation by the contempt of it; and ſo theſe inconveniences will ariſe;</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That God is a meere deceiver of miſerable men whom he calls to Salvation in the name of his <note place="margin">

                           <p n="2">2. That Miniſters are but falſe witneſſes; becauſe in their Miniſtry they offer Salvation conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally to many, who are determined to damnation abſolutely:</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Miniſtry of the Word canot leave men inexcuſable, for Reprobates may have this juſt plea: Lord, doſt thou puniſh for not believing in thy Sonne, when thou dideſt call us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve by the preaching of thy Word, thou dideſt decree to leave us (woefull men) in <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, to leave us neither power to believe, nor a Chriſt to believe in; how canſt thou juſtly charge us with ſinne, or encreaſe our puniſhment for not believing in him, whom thou dideſt reſolve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was that we ſhould never believe in. That Miniſtry gives men a faire excuſe which is given to no other end than to leave them without excuſe.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The Sacraments (by this opinion) ſignify nothing, ſeale up, conferre nothing to ſuch as are not Saved, but are meere blankes and empty ordinances unto them not through the fault of men but by the primary and abſolute will of God.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Laſtly, other gifts beſtowed upon men of what nature ſoever they be, are to the moſt that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them in Gods abſolute intention,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Unprofitable, ſuch as ſhall never doe them good in reference to their finall condition.</p>

Men that have them have little cauſe to be proud of them, (for they are the more unhappy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have them) or ſmall reaſon to be thankfull for them, or to love the giver of them, but to hate rather, becauſe they are but giftleſſe gifts, no better than an uſurers bounty, <hi>Jaells</hi> courteſie <hi>Souls</hi> beſtowing <hi>Michal</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> or a bayte for a proud fiſh which he ſwallowes with an hooke to boore.</p>

Me thinkes theſe Arminians talke in the ſpirit of Dr <hi>Story,</hi> as if they would ſcould us out of our faith, I will not ſay God out of his Throne; but he is able to plead his

own, we are unworthy to plead for him, yet thus farre he is pleaſed to honour us, as to admit us to plead for him, like as he is the God that pleades the cauſe of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: I have ſhewed how abſurdly this Author makes the ſalvation of reprobates to be intended by God, which yet in the iſſue is but after a conditionall manner, which is no more to intend their ſalvation, then their condemnation: well let us ſee the quality of theſe abſurdities he faſtens upon us. The firſt is, that God doth not meane the gifts of nature and grace unto thoſe that periſh: where to I anſwer, That as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gifts of nature, there is no colour for this, for they (as the Author ſets them downe) are theſe, creation, ſuſtentation, preſervation, health, beauty, wiſdome; now let any ſober man conſider whether it be poſſible, that it ſhould not be Gods meaning for as many as doe enjoy them, to enjoy them. As for the gifts of grace, theſe he divides into graces purchaſing Salvation, and graces applying Salvation, after it is purchaſed: the grace purchaſing Salvation is Chriſt; now we ſay that Salvation is purchaſed, to be conferred upon every man of ripe yeares conditionall only, namly, in caſe he believes, and on all that doe believe; for our Saviour hath ſaid <hi>that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believes ſhall be ſaved, whoſoever believes not ſhall be damned:</hi> as for the purchaſing the grace of faith, that we ſay is ſo purchaſed to be conferred abſolutly and not upon condition of any worke for that is manifeſt Pelagianiſme, and therefore Chriſt dyed not to procure that for all, for then all ſhould believe <hi>de facto,</hi> &amp; be ſaved: therefore we ſay, he dyed to procure this only for his elect. But the Arminians doe now openly profeſſe to the world. that Chriſt merited not faith and regeneration for any: ſo that God meant not, that Chriſt ſhould be given to any for the purchaſing of faith for him. So that herein certainly they are more to blame than we, by this Authors rules. As for the graces of applying Salvation, theſe are the <hi>Miniſtry of the word and Sacraments, the long ſuffering of God, the illumination of mens underſtandings, the plantation of many exellent vertues in their hearts.</hi> I will anſwer particularly concerning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, leaving thoſe many more which he conceales, to his owne enjoying the contemplation of them. And firſt as touching the Miniſtry of the Word and Sacraments, we willingly profeſſe, that we find no monument of the Americans enjoying of them before the diſcovery of that weſterne world by <hi>Columbus Veſputius,</hi> and <hi>Magellan,</hi> no nor to this day in the <hi>terra incognita Auſtrali,</hi> whereof relation is made by <hi>Ferdenando de Quir:</hi> but herein I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Arminians goe beyond us in there ſpirituall diſcoveries; for, by the Catop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricke glaſſe of their owne fancy, they tell us, that though Chriſt hath not been preached amongſt them by man, yet it may be he hath been preacht amongſt them by Angells, and deliver it for certaine, that having univerſall grace given them, if they uſe that well; as many as uſe it well ſhall have the Goſpell preached unto them, if not by men yet by Angells: but as for the adminiſtration of the Sacraments by. Angells alſo they have diſcovered nothing unto us hitherunto that I know. And as for Gods patience, undoubtedly they enjoy it as much as we, if they be as long lived as we. And I know nothing to the contrary as touching illumination naturall; that I doubt is not meant to be comprehended under the graces, aplying Salvation pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt, yet why not as well as fortitude, liberality, temperance, humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, chaſtity, and truly herein I doe not find them any whit inferiour unto Chriſtians, in ſome they went beyond us apparently; if we goe beyond them in any thing, I for my part take it to be in gace rather than nature. As for illumination ſpirituall, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane I know none they had, and as for Angelicall Revelation that is a diſh of Lettice for Arminian lippes; I want faith to give me any ſtomach to it: I come to thoſe exellent vertues which this Author pretendes to have been planted in their hearts; had he ſpared faith and repentance I could willingly have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the reſt amongſt heathens, and that according to Gods meaning; but what ſoever and in whome ſoever they are found, he thinks too hardly of us, when he ſaith, that God according to our opinion, doth not meane them to thoſe that enjoy them: and if he doth meane them unto ſuch, ſurely they are directed unto them: how is it poſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe, eſpecially as touching vertues, yea and the Miniſtry of the Word alſo, for he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to Preach the Goſpell to every creature, to wit, where they came: only we willingly confeſſe, then he doth not meane any of thoſe ſhall bring any of them that periſh unto Salvation. Secondly, as touching the lifting up of them up a bove the common ranke of men by theſe giftes, heare is a miſerable confuſed diſcourſe, ſo many things being put together, to make up one tearme in a propoſition;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56120:116"/>
but it is beneficiall to ſome to fiſh in troubled waters, and if my anſwer ſavour of the like confuſion it is nothing ſtrange, for he that walkes in the Sunne, muſt needs be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured. But I think I may ſay, looke what gifts men have, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> they are above the ranke of thoſe that have them not, but that they are given <hi>ut lapſu graviore cadant, That their fall may be the greater,</hi> This deſerves to be particularly conſidered. Firſt, in generall, I ſay whoſoever doth by occaſion of thoſe gifts here ſpoken of, <hi>fall the more grievouſly</hi> (which in many particulars is a myſtery to me, to the conſideration whereof I purpoſe to deſcend in the next place) God did both intend that ſuch a fall of theirs ſhould come to paſſe by his permiſſion, and that upon ſuch an occaſion: for even they that ſtumble at Gods word through diſobedience, and expreſſely ſaid by <hi>Peter</hi> to be ordained thereunto, thus I look out for a ground for that I deliver, giving leave to the adverſaries of Gods truth to roave at pleaſure in the pouring forth of their impious dictates: but come we to the particulars, &amp; firſt as touching the gifts of nature, I confes as touching the firſt of them <hi>(creation)</hi> that if that had not been, he had never fallen, but nevertheleſſe when God reſolved to create, he reſolved to create all things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Even the wicked againſt the day of evill,</hi> and if I erre in that I have an honourable Prophet to be my companion, even <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelfe. As for preſervation and ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 4.</note> I willingly confeſſe that if <hi>Judas</hi> had periſhed before he had been admitted into Chriſts ſervice, his damnation had been the more eaſy: and God electing him <hi>ad prodendum ſanguinem</hi> (if I may be ſo bold as to ſpeak in <hi>Auſtins</hi> language) did determine that his ſinne by Gods permiſſion ſhould be the more grievous, by occaſion of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement into the number of Chriſts diſciples. As for health, ſtrength, beauty, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, I ſee no reaſon why they ſhould promote any mans damnation, but that a foole, or an ill-favoured, or a weake, or a ſickly perſon, may be as great a ſinner as the wiſe man, or beautifull, or ſtrong, or healthy. How, becauſe Chriſt died for the ſalvation of as many as doe believe, which we all hold, or dyed to procure faith &amp; regeneration for none (as the Arminians hold) any man is promoted to a greater meaſure of ſinne thereby, is a miſtery to me. As touching the miniſtry of the word, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes plainly of ſome, that <hi>it had been better for them they had never known the way of right ouſneſſe, than after they have known it, to depart from the holy Commandement given to them,</hi> he ſaith not this of all, &amp; <hi>Austin</hi> profeſſeth of ſome Reprobates, that by the Goſpell they are called <hi>Ut proficiant ad exteriorem vitae emendationem quo mitius puniantur.</hi> As for the patience of God S. <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth plainly, that <hi>ſome after the hardneſſe of their hearts which cannot repent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing the patience and long ſuffering of God, and therein his goodneſſe leading them to repentance, doe</hi>

                                 <hi>thereby treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and Reprobation of the juſt judgement of God.</hi> And I ſhould think that even this God intended ſhould come to paſſe by his permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, otherwiſe he would have given them repentance, or ſhortned their daies, for give me leave to ſay with <hi>Auſtin, Quantamlibet prebuerit patientiam, niſi Deus dederit, quis agat pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiam.

As for the vertues in the laſt place, which here are pretended alſo to be given to worke for their harme, and among them faith and repentance, we are ſo farre from affirming, that they are given for the harme of them that periſh, that we to the contrary maintaine, that they are given to none but Gods elect, and to bring them unto ſalvation, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 48. <hi>As many believed as were ordained to eternall life.</hi> And faith is called the faith of the elect. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1. and <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 18.

Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is here ſhufled in among the reſt of theſe vertues, as if that were not all one with the illumination of the mind, at leaſt moſt deſervedly to be ranged with it. As for other vertues here mentioned, as <hi>fortitude, liberality, temperance, humility, chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> where theſe vertues are beſtowed after a naturall manner (for no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56120:117"/>
nor in any gracious manner, are they found in Reprobates, as I ſuppoſe, ready to be called at any time to an account upon that poynt, and to manifeſt ſix maine differences between the morall vertues of heathen men, and the ſame vertues (in name, and as touching the ſubſtance of the acts, wrought by them in Chriſtians) I ſhould think they are rather given for their good that enjoy them, than for their harme, namely, <hi>Ut profici ant ad exteriorem vitae emendationem, quo mitius puniantur.</hi> All the harme that may come by them, that I can deviſe for the preſent, is to grow proud of them: and I willingly profeſſe, that nothing makes a greater ſeparation from God then pride, and it may be, Moraliſts fret at this, that their Morality is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſteemed of. But what thinke you? May a man be proud of humility, for that is one of the excellent vertues here ſpecified; why not, of the naturall humility which is in them? As Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> obſerves in his defence of Poetry, that Philoſophers write Bookes againſt vaine-glory, whereunto nevertheleſſe they ſet their names. So they might write Books in commendation of humility, and thereunto ſet their names alſo. Yet I am not truly of ſuch an opinion, as to think, that God ſhould give any of theſe vertues, to the end they ſhould grow proud of them: for I doe not find it any way requiſite to a proud man, that he ſhould be vertuous: for in my judgement, pride is a very humble vice, and diſdaines not to dwell in the hearts of the meaneſt. <hi>Plato</hi> could diſcerne it through <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> his patcht coate: and when <hi>Diogenes</hi> trod under foot <hi>Platoes</hi> hangings, ſaying, I tread under my foot <hi>Platoes</hi> pride: it is obſerved that he did this <hi>majori feſtu,</hi> with greater pride: And as one ſometimes ſaid, a man may be as proud of a Cloakebagge which he carrieth behind him, as Cardinall <hi>Campeius</hi> was of his Sumpter-horſe, that followed after him; and yet that pride of his, might be of no better then of Brick-bats when all was known, what ſhew ſoever it made unto the people. And men of generous minds, and parts, and meanes anſwerable, are many times found, through the grace of God, more truly humble, than many a baſe fellow, that hath nothing to be made reckoning of but his own conceit. As the fly ſitting upon the Cart wheele in a dry Summer, ſaid, ſee what a duſt I make. Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> righteouſneſſe which he ſpeakes of, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. I take to be better than the vertue of any Philoſopher, which yet he accounted but dung, that he might winne Chriſt. But by the way I obſerve how liberall theſe men are, in acknowledging the gifts of God in groſſe, which they will be found utterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny if they be examined upon them in particular. As for example, Morall vertues (we commonly ſay) are <hi>Habitus acquiſiti,</hi> acquiſite habits, and that by frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of conſimilar acts, whereupon the habit ariſeth naturally: Now doe theſe men maintaine that God is the Author of theſe acts, otherwiſe than by concourſe, working in them, <gap reason="foreign">

But to draw to an end of this confuſed diſcourſe, wherein are clapt together gifts of nature, ſeaven whereof are reckoned up as creation, ſuſtentation, preſervation, health, ſtrength, beauty and wiſdome; and gifts of grace, &amp; that either purchaſing ſalvation as Chriſt, or applying ſalvation, which are of foure forts. 1.

them that enjoy them, but as they are mingled with the elect, which hath no colour as I can perceive, ſave of the Miniſtry of the Word &amp; Sacraments, for is it ſober to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to any, to ſay that creation, or preſervation, or health, ſtrength, beauty, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or Chriſt himſelfe, or Gods patience, or illumination of mind, or the vertues he ſpeakes of; as knowledge, faith, repentance, fortitude, liberality, temperance, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, chaſtity, are not given to any, but as they are mingled among the elect? Or that they are given for their hurt: touching this laſt I anſwere in briefe, that it is a very abſurd thing to ſay, that God gives any of theſe gifts to man to this end, that they may by occaſion be hurt by them: but God both gives them, and (in caſe they prove an occaſion of harme, of ſinne unto them) he permits them through occaſion from them to ſinne, and therein to preſevere (as touching Reprobates) to damne them for their ſinnes, to the manifeſtation of his own glory, in the way of juſtice vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: as alſo hereby, the more <hi>To declare the riches of his glory upon the veſſells of mercy which he hath prepared unto glory.

As for the laſt of an abſolute decree, cutting off and rejecting ſome from grace and glory, I will end this with repreſenting the ſottiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this Author, herein parbreaking his ſtomack, without all judgement and ſobriety. Firſt obſerve, how he claps together grace and glory, as if there were no difference in the manner of Gods cutting off from the one &amp; from the other. (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the manner of Gods cutting off from the one, as it is maintained by us, is ſuch as impudency it ſelfe, hath not the face to lay any thing to our charge therein.) As for the manner of Gods cutting off from the other, as it is maintained by us, there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch abſoluteneſſe, as they maligne bitterly, but withall it is ſo cleerely ſet down in holy Scripture, that their hearts ſerve them not with open face to vent their ſpleen againſt it; and that is a chiefe reaſon of this Authors declining the other controverſies, and keeping himſelfe only to this, though I verily think, this hath proceeded from the counſell of his abettors: And for the ſame reaſon it is, that he claps togeather the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off from grace and glory. But I will take leave to diſtinguiſh them, and anſwer diſtinctly to both a part, to make their madneſſe and unreaſonableneſſe more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. And firſt I will ſpeake of Gods abſolute decree of cutting off from glory. Now this is well known to be oppoſed to a decree conditionall, as in the end of the former Section this Author calls it, and uſeth it, as according to their own doctrine, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to ours, but moſt indiſcreetely and unlearnedly. This conditionall will of God is to be underſtood, <hi>quoad res volitas,</hi> as touching the things willed by God, ſo <hi>Voſſius</hi> accommodates it in his Hiſtory of the Pelagian Hereſy, as before I have ſhewed, and makes it all one in effect with Gods antecedent will: and D. <hi>Iaokſon</hi> in his Book of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence treating hereof, profeſſeth in plaine termes, that the diſtinction of <hi>Voluntas antecedens</hi> and <hi>conſequens,</hi> is to be underſtood, <hi>quoad res volitas,</hi> as touching the things willed. Now the thing willed here, is the cutting off from glory: now this Author togeather with his inſtructer, will have the will of God concerning this, to be conditionall, to wit, that it is Gods will, that no man ſhall be cut off from glory, but for ſinne, now we ſay ſo too, and profeſſe, that like as God hath not ordained that any ſhall be damned, but for finall perſeverance in ſinne: ſo likewiſe God hath not ordained that any man ſhall be cut off from glory, but for finall perſeverance in ſinne. But whereas the Remonſtrants maintained, that there is no other decree of Reprobation but this, and ſo likewiſe on the other ſide, that there is no decree of Predeſtination, but ſuch as is properly oppoſite hereunto, namely this, <hi>That the decree</hi>
                                 <pb n="216" facs="tcp:56120:118"/>
                                 <hi>by which God hath purpoſed in Chriſt, and for Chriſt, to ſave thoſe that believe and repent to the end, is the whole and entire decree of Predeſtination unto ſalvation.</hi> On this poynt the Contra-Remonſtrants oppoſed them: and accordingly our Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Divines, make this the firſt erroneous opinion, which they reject up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt Article as touching election. And likewiſe as touching Reprobation, the firſt erroneous opinion which they reject, is this, <hi>That the decree by which God from all eternity, and that irrevocably, hath purpoſed out of lapſed mankind to leave none, but the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and incredulous in ſinne, and under the wrath of God, as being aliens from Chriſt, is the whole and entire decree of reprobation.</hi> This I ſay is the firſt erroneous opinion which our Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Divines reject: which this Author takes no notice of, but moſt unlearnedly diſcovers, that he underſtands not the ſtate of the queſtion. Secondly, Now I come to Gods abſolute decree of cutting off from grace, this we willingly confeſſe, is meerely abſolute and unconditionall <hi>quoad res volitas,</hi> as touching the things willed by God; for the things willed by God herein, are the denyall of mercy, and grace, to regenerate ſome; the denyall of the grace of faith and repentance, concerning which the Apoſtle profeſſeth, that God proceeds herein, meerely according to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 30. <hi>Even as they in times paſt have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbeliefe.</hi> Where <hi>to obtaine mercy,</hi> in the Apoſtles language, is plainely as much as to believe. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in many places juſtifies this, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 105. <hi>ad Sixtum. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                              <p n="1">1. <hi>Christ came not into the World to procure the ſalvation of them that periſh.</hi> I anſwere, That look in what ſort he came into the World, to procure the ſalvation of them that periſh by their Doctrine, after the ſame ſort he came to procure their ſalvation by our Doctrine. For as it is their Doctrine, that God decreed that for Chriſts ſake, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſhould redound to all that believe, ſo is this our Doctrine alſo: but we deny that this is the whole decree of predeſtination. We farther ſay, that God purpoſed to beſtow Faith on ſome, and not on others, and accordingly to ſend Chriſt to merit faith and regeneration for them, which the Remonſtrants in the <hi>Cenſura Cenſurae,</hi> doe now a daies utterly deny; and if this Author, together with his inſtructer, think that
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56120:118"/>
Chriſt was ſent to merit faith and regeneration for all, then either abſolutely or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally; if abſolutely, then all muſt believe <hi>de facto,</hi> and be regenerated; if condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, then let them diſcover unto us this condition, and avoyd direct Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme if they can. 2. Indeed we think the word is not ſent to all that periſh, we find it by manifeſt experience: in reference to Miniſtry humane, and if they have ſo ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly rubd their own foreheads, as to faine out of their own heads a Miniſtry An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall, let them not expect that we ſhould take their forgeries for Oracles Divine. 3. It is not true, that where it is ſent among them that periſh, 'tis ſent only that they ſhould ſlight it, it may be ſent as well, <hi>ut proficiant ad exteriorem vitae emendationem quo mitius puniantur:</hi> as for thoſe that doe ſlight it, and ſtumble at it, being diſobedient, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> plainly ſaith, that <hi>hereunto they were ordained.</hi> Let them therefore cry downe <hi>Peter</hi> firſt, and then we will take it in good part, to be cryed downe alſo. And if God ſent his Sonne into the World to be crucified by ſome; why might not he as well ſend the Preaching of Chriſt into the World, to be ſlighted and deſpiſed by others: and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath profeſſed, that the Preachers of it, are unto God a ſweet ſavour in Chriſt, even in them that periſh: Yet we ſay not that this is the end why God ſends it to any: But we ſay God both ſends it, and permits many to ſlight it, and to perſevere in the contempt of it, that he may manifeſt his glory in their juſt condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and declare thereby alſo the riches of his glory on the veſſells of mercy, whom he hath prepared unto glory, by making it appeare, what a mercifull diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence God hath put between them, and others. To the particulars ſubordinate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, I anſwer diſtinctly thus.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. God deceives none in calling them to Salvation, in the name of his Sonne, by the preaching of his Word, any more by our Doctrine, than by the Doctrine of this Author: for as he maintaines that God intends Salvation to all men, no otherwiſe than in caſe they believe, ſo doe we; and as we maintaine that God doth fully intend to moſt the contrary, but no otherwiſe than in caſe they believe not, ſo doth he: only as touching the obtaining of faith and regeneration, here is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us: we maintaine with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that God hath mercy on whom he will, in beſtowing the grace of faith and regeneration, and hardeneth whom he will by denying of it; ſoe doth not he: and accordingly we ſay, Chriſt merited faith and regeneration for his elect. But the Remonſtrants openly profeſſe that he merited faith and regeneration for none at all. Hereby let the indifferent judge which of us makes God the greateſt deceiver they or we. And the truth is, this Author nor his inſtructer, are willing to diſcover themſelves in this poynt, for feare leaſt nothing ſhould ſave them from breaking their necks, but to be received upon the featherbed of Pelagianiſme: ſo fearfull a precipice is likely there to meet with them; at the margent of this, there ſtands a wild quotation thus, <hi>Suffrag: Britaine, p.</hi> 43. as if the Author was loath his meaning ſhould be found: or it may be in tranſcribing the coppy ſent him he did miſtake. But the Article upon which theſe Theſes are dilivered he utterly leaves out, like as in his former quotation of the ſufferages. But after much ſearching I gueſſe I find that which he refers unto on the 3. Article, 3. Poſition, which is pag: 166. in <hi>Synod. Dordare:</hi> and in the Engliſh ſufferages of our Divines of Great <hi>Britaine,</hi> the poſition is this, <hi>whome God doth thus prepare by his Spirit</hi> (as was ſignifyed in the former poſition) <hi>through the meanes of the word, thoſe doth he truly and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly invite and call to faith and converſion.</hi> I make no queſtion but whatſoever God doth, he doth truly and ſeriouſly: And as for that <hi>ſancta ſimulatio</hi> which this Author for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly upbraided our Divines with, for attributing it unto God, I have formerly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the falſe nature of that aſpertion, though he thought to walke in the clouds, that his jugling might not be diſcovered. The explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the poſition is added thus, <hi>By the nature of the benefit offered, and by the evident word of God we muſt judge of thoſe helpes of graces which are beſtowed on men, and not by the abuſe of them. Therefore when the Goſpell of its' owne nature calls men unto repentance and Salvation, when the incitements and Divine graces tend the ſame way, wee muſt not thinke any thing is done fainedly by God; this is proved too.</hi> All theſe I willingly acknowledge neither doe I know any of our Divines that deny it; and more particularly I am willing to particulate wherein I take it to conſiſt. God hereby doth ſignify that as many as believe ſhall be Saved: and ſo I ſay he doth ſeriouſly intend as much; as likewiſe, that none ſhall be ſaved without faith; likewiſe God doth ſignify, that he is well pleaſed, with faith and converſion, in whomſoever he finds it, and herein he deales moſt truly and ſeriouſly, likewiſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56120:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he ſignifies his own will to make it their duty to believe, which alſo is moſt true and ſerious. But none of all theſe I know full well, will ſatisfy theſe with whom wee deale; unleſſe we acknowledge, that God hath a kind of velleity alſo, both of their converſion and ſalvation; but let them ſhew me any paſſage out of theſe Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges where this is acknowledged. They adde, <hi>If God ſhould not ſeriouſly invite all whom he vouchſafeth this gift of his Word and ſpirite, to a ſerious converſion, ſurely both God ſhould deceive many whom he calls in his Sonnes name, and the meſſengers of the Evangelicall promiſe might be accuſed of falſewitneſse, and thoſe which being called to converſion, doe neglect to obey, might be more excuſable.</hi> All this I willingly grant, neither doe I know any Divine of ours that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes it, according to the three particulars formerly ſpecifyed, wherein I deſired to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the truth and ſeriouſneſſe of all this, though thoſe worthy Divines of ours goe not ſo farre. As for their laſt clauſe which is this, <hi>For that calling by the Word and ſpirit cannot be thought to leave men unexcuſable, which is only exhibited to this end, to make them unexcuſable.</hi> I willingly confeſſe I doe not ſufficiently underſtand them in this. For albeit I have already particulated divers things werein the ſeriouſneſſe of this Divine invitation doth conſiſt, (neither doe I find any end of this Divine invitation mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at all by theſe our Divines, whom from my heart I honour for their juſt deſert;) yet to me it ſeemes moſt cleare, that Revelation doth ſo neceſſarily take away excuſe, upon pretence of ignorance, and admonition, and invitation, as neceſſarily takes away excuſe, upon pretence of not being admoniſhed and invited, that if God did invite them to no other end than this, namely to take away theſe excuſes, ſurely theſe excuſes were clearly taken away, and conſequently ſo farre they ſhould prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable: But I gueſſe they take the denomination of <hi>inexcuſable,</hi> not according to the ſignification formall as it ſignifyes bereaved of excuſe: but rather according to the ſignification materiall, connotated thereby which is faultineſſe, and in this ſence I confeſſe, it is ordinarily taken togeither with the condition of being without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and thus &amp; in this ſenſe I willingly ſubſcribe unto them, and therewithall ſhew what I take to be their meaning, namely this, that if God, making ſhew that if they believe he will accept them, and that they ſhall be Saved, did not indeed meane that he would in that caſe accept and ſave them, then there were no reaſon why they ſhould be accounted faulty and condemned for their not believing. Thus in a deſire exactly to conforme my ſelfe to the judgement of theſe worthyes of our Church, made choyſe of by our Soveraign to be ſent in ſo Honourable an Embaſſage, to countenance that famous Synod of the moſt reformed Churches; I have made bold to interpret them, and to ſhew my concurrence with them, although I have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with any of them upon that poynt, which if I had; like enough I might have received better ſatisfaction: And I hope they will not diſdaine that without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting them I have adventured thus to interpret them; and what doe I know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their judgement may not prove to be the very ſame, and that in deed they had no other meaning.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. My former anſwer will ſerve for this, Gods Miniſters doe offer Salvation conditionally, to wit, upon condition of faith, neither, are any ordained to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but in caſe of infidelity: yet I ſee the cunning carriage of this Authors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructer, for he would faine fly from the abſoluteneſſe, or conditionality of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, as touching the things willed <hi>quoad res volitas,</hi> unto the abſoluteneſſe or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionality of it: <hi>quoad actum volentis,</hi> as touching the act of willing, although both <hi>Uoſſius</hi> practiſe, and this Authors alſo in expreſſing his owne meaning of Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall will, and Doctor <hi>Jackſons</hi> profeſſion is to the contrary: namely that it is to be taken <hi>quoad res volitas</hi> only, and not <hi>quoad actum volentis:</hi> but withall we teach, that Gods Miniſters doe not only teach upon what tearmes on mans part, God will either beſtow ſalvation, or inflict damnation: but alſo they teach that upon no tearmes on our parts, but meerely according to the good pleaſure of his own will, doth God ſhew mercy unto ſome, beſtowing faith and repentance upon them, and by denying the ſame grace harden others, and they are the true witneſſes of God, equally in both.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. Neither is there any iuſt excuſe hereby left to Reprobates, yet I confeſſe, this were a very plauſible pretence, if we had no Oracles of God at all to be the rule of our faith, concerning God, and his providence: but as we have, ſo we faile not therein, of a direct anſwer hereunto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. For after the Apoſtle had profeſſed, <hi>That God hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth:</hi> v. 18. Forthwith he
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56120:119"/>
brings in this ojection upon the ſtage v. 19. <hi>Thou wilt ſay then, why doth he yet complaine? for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> And both <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and Arminians confeſſe, that where obduration hath place, there is no power of obedience: And the Apoſtle himſelfe implyes no leſſe in that place. Now what doth the Apoſtle anſwer hereunto but this v. 20. <hi>O man who art thou, which diſputeſt with God? ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it why haſt thou formed me thus?</hi> 21. <hi>Hath not the Potter power over the clay of the ſame lumpe to make one veſſell to honour and another to diſhonour?</hi> as much as to ſay, if God be acknowledged to be our Creatour, we muſt give him leave to doe what he will with his creature, for doth not every creature doe what he will with the worke of his hand? Every tradeſman in his trade takes as much liberty to doe with the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of his hands, as this comes to. And <hi>Medina</hi> hath not ſpared to profeſſe, and that <hi>tanquam ex concordi omnium Theologorum ſententiâ:</hi> that if God ſhould inflict the very paines of Hell upon an innocent creature; he ſhall doe no unjuſt act, though herein he ſhould not carry himſelfe as <hi>Judex,</hi> Judge, but as <hi>Dominus vitae &amp; mortis</hi> as Lord of life amd Death. And we all know what power God giveth us over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour creatures, to ſtrangle ſome, to cut the throats of others, to knocke downe others, not with reference to the moderation of their paine, but only to the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome condition of their fleſh unto us. And we know what power God executed upon his own deare Sonne to break him for our iniquityes, on him to lay the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement of our peace, that ſo by his ſtripes we might be healed. But let that paſſe, let us try another way that may be anſwered unto this. Suppoſe not one ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for want of faith, but only left to be judged by the covenant of workes, who ſeeth not but that the ſame plea hath place here as well as in the former caſe, and God may be as well chalenged for injuſtice, in condemning men for breach of the law, who have no power to keepe the law? And who ſees not how ready this Author is to juſtifye this plea, and conſequently acknowledge that every man hath power to keepe the law; and ſo to bring us back againe to the covenant of works, or to confound the covenant of grace with the covenant of works: which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is their courſe throughout. For they maintaine that every man hath univerſall grace for the enlivening of their wills, whereby they are inabled to will any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good whereto they ſhall be excited, and who doubts but obedience to the law, and that in all perfection, is a ſpirituall good: againe they maintaine that they can believe if they will, and ſo accordingly doe any good thing that they will: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were not the will in fault, I know no naturall power defective in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of any good, that a man hath a will unto: this I can ſhew under the hands of one of them, in a manuſcript ſent unto me. And I have good reaſon to conceive there are more hands in it than one. Thirdly conſider, doſt thou complaine thou hadſt no power to believe, but I pray thee tell me, haſt thou any will to believe? If thou neither haſt, nor ever hadſt any will to believe, what a ſhamefull and unreaſonable thing is it to complaine that thou haſt no power to believe? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had a moſt gratious will, but he found in himſelfe no power to doe that he would, but what is <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 18, 19.</note> the iſſue of this complaint? To fly to the face of God? Nothing leſſe! but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his own wretchedneſſe, and flee unto God in this manner, <hi>who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> And receiving a gracious anſwer concerning this, concludes with <note place="margin">24. 25.</note> thankes, <hi>I thank my God through my Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> if I have a will to believe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, I have no cauſe to complaine, but to runne rather unto God with thankes for this, and pray him to give that power, which I find wanting in me. And indeed (as I may adde in the fourth place) this impotency of believing, and infidelity, the fruit of naturall corruption common to all, is meerely a morall impotency, and the very ground of it is, the corruption of the will: therefore men cannot believe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not repent, cannot doe any thing pleaſing unto God, becauſe they will not, they have no delight therein; but all their delight is carnall, ſenſuall, and <hi>becauſe they are in the</hi> 
                                 <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
                                 <hi>fleſh they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                                    </gap>annot pleaſe God:</hi> and becauſe of the hardneſſe of their hearts they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ſinne is to them as a ſweet morſell unto an Epicure, which he rolleth under his tongue. Fiftly, doſt thou blaſpheame God, becauſe of Leprous Parents, thou art begot and conceived, and borne a leprous child? What impudency then is it in thee, to challenge him for injuſtice, in that the ſpirituall leproſy of thy firſt Parents, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated to thy ſoule. Laſtly, if thou renounceſt the Goſpell, what reaſon haſt thou to complaine of want of power to embrace it, ſo farre as not to renounce it? haſt thou not as much power to believe, as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had? as many a prophane perſon
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56120:120"/>
and hipocrite hath, that is, bred and brought up in the Church of God? Hadſt thou gone ſo farre as they, and performed ſubmiſſion unto the Goſpell, by profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, ſurely thou ſhouldeſt never be brought to condemnation for not profeſſing of it, but rather for not walking according to the rule of it; which thou promiſedſt when firſt thou gaveſt thy name to Chriſt. I come to the third.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. Look what the Word promiſeth, that doe the Sacraments ſcale: the word promiſeth Juſtification &amp; Salvation to all that beleive, the ſame doth the Sacraments ſeal. As Circumſion <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Is ſaid to be the ſeale of the Rightiouſnes of faith</hi> ſo is Baptiſme: it did in our Saviours dayes and in the dayes of his Apoſtles ſeale to the believer, and penitent Perſon the aſſurance of the forgiveneſſe of their ſinnes; over and above Baptiſme is the Sacrament of our birth in Chriſt, and the Lords Supper of our growth in Chriſt, each an outward and viſible ſigne of an inward &amp; inviſible grace. But what is the grace were of the Sacrament is a ſigne? Is it a power to doe good if a man will? Call you that grace which is not ſo much as goodneſſe, for certainly goodneſſe conſiſts not in a power to doe good if a man will, but in a definite inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the will it ſelfe, to delight in that which is good, and to be prone to doe it. But this grace whereof Baptiſme is a ſigne, is <hi>ſuo tempore conferenda,</hi> like as Circumciſion was, even to thoſe Jewes who yet were not regenerated, untill they were partakers of the Goſpell. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth.</hi> Writing unto the twelve tribes of the Jewes. And it is very ſtrange to me, that regeneration ſhould ſo many years goe before vocation. But this oppoſite Doctrine, and the ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a blanke is nothing ſtrange to me: I was acquainted with it twenty yeares agoe, and I ſeeme plainly to diſcerne the chimney from whence all the ſmoake comes.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. As for other gifts beſtowed on the Reprobates.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. We willingly confeſſe they ſhall never bring them to ſalvation, be they as great as thoſe who were beſtowed on <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato, Ariſtides, Sophocles,</hi> and the moſt learned morall and wiſe men of the World, that never were acquainted with the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Godlineſſe: it was wont to be received generally for a truth, that <hi>Extra Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam non eſt ſatus;</hi> But Arminians take liberty to coyne new Articles of our Creed.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. But yet they may doe them good, hereby they may <hi>Proficere ad exteriorem vitae emendationem quo mitius puniantur.</hi> For certainly it ſhall be eaſier in the day of udge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for <hi>Cicero</hi> then for <hi>Cattline,</hi> for <hi>Auguſtus</hi> than for <hi>Tiberius,</hi> for <hi>Trajan</hi> than for <hi>Heliogabalus.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="3">3. And therefore it is certainly falſe that they are hurtfull, and that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of extreme hatred. And as for love, the Scripture teacheth us that <hi>Jacob</hi> was loved of God, and <hi>Eſau</hi> hated, each before they were borne. Such is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the elect as <hi>Jacob,</hi> of all the Reprobates as <hi>Eſau;</hi> and in <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> his judgement, <hi>Non velle alicui vitam aeternam eſt ipſum odiſſe.</hi> Knowledge I confeſſe of the myſteries of Godlineſſe, where life and converſation is not anſwerable, doth encreaſe mens condemnation: neither is God bound to change the corrupt heart of any man: if they are workers of iniquity Chriſt will not know them at the great day, though they have Propheſyed in his name, and in his name caſt out Devills; neither was it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of, that the graces of edification, and graces of ſanctification muſt goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and that God in giving the one, is bound to give the other. As for being proud of them, pride for ought I know, requires no other cauſes but domeſticall corruption: but he that acknowledgeth God to be the giver of any gift, and hath an heart to be thankfull for it, I make no doubt but he hath more grace than of edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation only: certainly the gifts they have, ſinke them not to hell, but their corrupt heart in abuſing them. And hath a man no cauſe to be thankfull unto God for one gift, unleſſe he will adde another? The Gentiles are charged for unthankfulneſſe <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. But it ſeems by this Authors Divinity, it was without cauſe, unleſſe we will with this Author ſay, they all had ſufficiency of meanes without, and power within to bring them to ſalvation: and what had Iſraell more? Or the elect of God more in any age? True, for according to the Arminian tenet, an elect hath no more cauſe to be thankfull to God for any converting grace, than a Reprobate. In a word, what good act wrought in the heart of man, whether of faith or of repentance, or any kind of obedience, hath man cauſe to be thankfull to God for, when God workes it in him no otherwiſe than <hi>modó homo velit,</hi> and ſo they confeſſe he workes every ſinfull
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56120:120"/>
act? Have they not in this caſe more cauſe to thank themſelves than to thank God? And unleſſe we concurre with them in ſo ſhameleſſe, unchriſtian, graceleſſe, and ſenſeleſſe an opinion, and in effect, if God converts the heart of man according to the meere pleaſure of his will, and hardeneth others: all the gifts that he beſtowes on man, are cenſured by this audacious cenſurer, <hi>as Sauls beſtowing Michal on David, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells courteſy, and uſurers bounty, &amp;c. or a baite for a poore fiſh,</hi> as if God needed any ſuch courſe to permit him to ſinne in what kind or degree ſoever, to expoſe him to any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of condemnation; or as if the Creator hath not power to doe what he will with his creature, any more than an Uſurer hath over his poore brother, or <hi>Saul</hi> over <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> or the like. Thus the conſideration of his third reaſon I have brought to an end. I come to the Fourth.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. Hope doth <hi>(excitare)</hi> ſtirre men up to beginne, and <hi>(corroborare)</hi> ſtrengthen in the doing of any good action begunne. By this hope of heaven did our Saviour ſtirre up himſelfe to endure the Croſle and deſpiſe the ſhame <hi>Heb.</hi> 12 By this he heartned his Diſciples to doe and ſuffer for his ſake <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Abraham</hi> left his Country and kindred at Gods call, becauſe he looked for a Citty whoſe builder and maker was God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Moſes</hi> left all the pleaſures and treaſures of Aegypt, and endured afflictions with the people of God, becauſe he ſaw him that was inviſible <hi>v.</hi> 27. The Martyrs endured racks, gibbets, Lyons, ſword, fire, with a world of other torments, becauſe they looked for a better reſurrection, <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>Paul</hi> endeavours alwaies to keep a good conſcience through the hope of a bleſſed reſurrection. <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 15. All the heroicall acts of active and paſſive obedience, have ſprung from the hope of a weight of glory.</p>
                           <p>Husbandmen, Souldiers, Merchants, are all whetted on by hope to diligence in their callings, as daily experience ſhewes. Hope (ſaith <hi>Aquinas) confert ad operationem,</hi> and he proveth it firſt by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 10. He which Eareth and Threſheth muſt Eare and Threſh in hope: And then by a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold reaſon. 1. From the Nature of hopes object, <hi>Bonum arduum &amp; poſſible,</hi> ſome excellent good at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by induſtry. <hi>Exiſtimatio ardut excitat attentionem,</hi> hope to get that by paines, which is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be a thing of worth, ſtirres up to paines taking. 2. From the effect of hope, which is <hi>delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> an inward pleaſure, which the party that lives under hope is affected with by his hope. There is no man which hath an inward contentment and ſatisfaction of heart in the work that he hath to doe, but goes on merrily. The hope of Heaven therefore is a great encouragement to piety.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The feare of Hell alſo is a ſtrong curb to hold men in from Wickedneſſe, and therefore (ſaith one) God hath planted in men a feare of vengeance, that by it, as the ſhip by the rudder, the ſoule may be preſently, turn'd aſide from any rocks, or gulfes, or quick-ſands of ſinne, when it is neere them, and ſo may ſteere its courſe another way. For this cauſe, feare of God, and abſtaining from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, are often joyned together in Scripture <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 17. And the want of this feare is made the root of all licentiouſneſſe in ſinning <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 11. Nor doth feare only hinder a bad action, but it promotes a good. It hinders a bad action directly, becauſe it is <hi>fuga mali,</hi> a flying from that evill of miſery, which is annexed to the evill of ſinne; and it promotes a good action accidentally, becauſe men think that they are never ſo ſafe from the miſchiefe which they feare, as when they are exerciſed in ſuch imployments as tend to the getting of a contrary ſtate.</p>
                           <p>Worke out your ſalvation (ſaith the Apoſtle) with feare and trembling; implying, that the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of ſalvation goes not on handſomly except the fear of miſſing it be an ingredient to the work.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond branch of this Reaſon is, That by the abſolute decree Feare and hope are taken away. For hope is properly exerciſed about <hi>Bonum futurum &amp; poſſibile haberi,</hi> ſome good thing that may be obtained, not a good thing that muſt be obtained of neceſſity: and the object of feare is <hi>malum poſſibile vitari,</hi> an evill that may be eſcaped. For <hi>metus eſt fuga mali,</hi> feare is a flying from evill, and therefore ſuppoſeth that the evill is avoydable; for no man will fly from an evill that cannot be prevented, but will yeild himſelfe up to it, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> did to the murtherers in the Senate houſe. Now by this decree Heaven and Hell are not <hi>objecta poſſibilia,</hi> but <hi>neceſſaria.</hi> Heaven ſhall unavoydably be obtained, by thoſe that are elected, and Hell muſt as certainly be endured, by thoſe that in Gods eternall purpoſe are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. For men have no power to alter their eternall ſtates: all men by this decree, are precisely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined <hi>ad unum,</hi> to one ſtate, to neceſſary ſalvation, or neceſſary damnation, without any power or liberty to chooſe whether.</p>

                              <pb n="222" facs="tcp:56120:121"/>
And from hence the concluſion is cleere, that the abſolute decree, takes away the chiefeſt induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to holineſſe, and determents from wickedneſſe, and conſequently hinders a Godly life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly.</p>

But ſuch is not the condition of this Authors diſcourſe; for the farther I wade into it, the weaker and weaker it appeares. And to this I anſwer firſt in generall, That our Brittaine Divines make anſwer to the like crimination made againſt our Doctrine upon the 5. Article p. 168. according to the Engliſh tranſlation of it; ſaying, Both Gods truth, and mans expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, eaſily wipe off this aſperſion. For this Chriſtian perſwaſion of perſeverance and ſalvation, not only in reſpect of its own nature, but alſo according to the very event in the Church, doth by Gods bleſſing produce a quite contrary effect. Firſt in reſpect of the thing it ſelfe. The certainty of the end doth not take away, but eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the uſe of the meanes. And the ſame holy men, who upon ſure grounds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe unto themſelves, both conſtancy in the way of this Pilgrimage, and fruition of God in their everlaſting home, know alſo that theſe are not obtained without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the duties of holineſſe, and the avoydance of contrary vices: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they turne not their backs from theſe meanes, but induſtriouſly embrace and proſecute them. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 3. Every man that hath this hope in himſelfe, purifyeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, even as he is pure. <hi>Eſay</hi> 38. 5. When <hi>Hezechiah</hi> had received that promiſe from God of an addition of fifteen years to his life, he did not therefore neglect the uſe of medicines or meat, but, that this promiſed event might be brought into act, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed for the cure of his body, the plaiſter which was preſcribed unto him by the Prophet. The Apoſtle doth altogether reiect this conſequence of carnall ſecurity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to this Doctrine, and that with a kind of indignation <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1. Shall we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſinne that grace may abound? God forbid. How ſhall we which are dead to ſinne, live any longer therein? As if S. <hi>Paul</hi> would intimate unto us, not only the incongruity, but alſo the impoſſibility of ſuch a ſequel. 2. As touching the event; true it is, that any the moſt wholſome truth of God, may be perverted by the abuſe of men. But upon this doctrine, we cannot acknowledge that there groweth any ſuch inconvenience, no not <hi>de facto,</hi> that is, in the event it ſelfe. Let us take a view of the reformed Churches, in which this confidence of perſeverance and inviolable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption is believed and maintained. Doe we find that thereupon the bridle is let looſe unto ryot? That piety is trampled downe? We give thankes unto God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that amongſt ours (who enjoy this full perſwaſion of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all comfort, and are confident that there is an inheritance which cannot be loſt, laid up for them in Heaven) there is not found leſſe care of Godlineſſe, nor leſſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour (ſo farre forth as mans infirmity will ſuffer) to live an unblameable life, then is to be found among any ſort of theſe, who pinne their perſeverance on their own free will, and will not grant it to flow from any foregoing election of God. This may ſuffice for anſwer to the generality of the crimination.</p>
                              <p>From the generality he deſcends to ſpecialties. And in the firſt place he urgeth, It takes away hope and feare. He beginnes with hope, and enlargeth himſelfe in the commendation thereof out of Scripture, <hi>By this hope of Heaven, did our Saviour stirre up himſelfe to endure the croſſe, and deſpiſe the ſhame. Heb.</hi> 12. He could not alleadge a more pregnant paſſage to cut his own throat, and mortify the vigour of his argument; For in this place it depends upon ſuch a notion of hope, as ſignifies <hi>only a poſſibility of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a future good, and not a neceſſity of obtaining it,</hi> as afterwards himſelfe accommodates it, and ſo he will have the hope which here he inſiſts upon, ſuch as is mixed with feare; as if our Saviour were in doubt of obtaining a Crowne of glory. <hi>By this he heartned his Diſciples to ſuffer for his ſake. Math.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Rejoyce and be glad for great is your reward in heaven.</hi> Here alſo we have no hope mixed with fear, whereupon he heartens them; but the very aſſurance of faith grounded upon Chriſts promiſe, and what greater aſſurance then
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56120:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this? The like promiſe for aſſurance of faith is made <hi>Math.</hi> 10. 32. And indeed hope in the Scripture phraſe (though in theſe places there is no mention thereof) is but an expectation of enjoying that whereof we have a certain aſſurance by Faith. The object of faith being <hi>Verbum rei,</hi> of hope, <hi>res verbi,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> is ſaid to diſtinguiſh them. Such is the hope ſignified by our looking for the Saviour <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20. For therefore we look for him, becauſe we are perſwaded by the aſſurance of faith, that he ſhall come, and that as a Saviour unto us, as there 'tis expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>Who ſhall change our vile bodies, and make them like to his glorious body.</hi> Such is the hope mentioned, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 5. as grounded upon their <hi>true knowledge of the grace of Chriſt</hi> v. 6. And upon their <hi>Faith</hi> v. 4. For upon believing we rejoyce <hi>with joy unſpeakable and glorious,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. And this joy is <hi>in hope of the glory of God, Rom.</hi> 5. 2. Of the ſame nature is that hope <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 13. So <hi>Abrahams</hi> looking for a City <hi>whoſe builder and maker is God. Heb.</hi> 11. 8, 9, 10. But was not this hope of his grounded upon aſſurance of faith to enjoy it? So <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſeeing of him that was inviſible, was by the eye of faith. And the ſcope of that whole Chapter, is for the commendation of faith; a faith therefore they had of a better reſurrection, and the certainty hereof, was the certainty of faith. Now let every ſober reader judge, which of our doctrines doth more tend to the juſtifying of a certainty of ſalvation, the Arminians or ours.</p>
                              <p>That which followeth of <hi>the Husbandmen, Merchants, Souldiers,</hi> is farre of another nature; their hopes of their ends have no ground of faith: many times it comes to paſſe, that <hi>ſpem mentita ſeges,</hi> &amp; though <hi>aliquis pendens in cruce vota facit,</hi> yet moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it proves but a vaine hope. Merchants many times prove bankrupts; and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers when they are moſt erected with hope of victory, doe ſometimes moſt ſhamefully take the foyle: What a proud meſſage did <hi>Benhadab</hi> ſend to <hi>Ahab</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 10. <hi>The Gods doe ſo to mee, and more alſo, if the duſt of Samaria be enough to all the people that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low mee, for every man an handfull.</hi> But <hi>Ahab</hi> anſwered him ſaying. <hi>Let not him that girdeth his harneſſe boaſt himſelfe as he that putteth it off.</hi> At the battle of <hi>Lipſich</hi> upon <hi>Tillies</hi> defeating of the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> word hereof was diſpatched with poſt haſt to the Emperour, together with ſome of the Dukes Enſignes, and ſcoffes upon the Duke himſelfe; they were confident of beating <hi>Sweden</hi> and that ſo all Germany ſhould be theirs; but herein that old Lad reckoned before his hoſt; the ſame Poſt brought heavy newes to <hi>Vienna</hi> at length, of a great diſcomfiture to the Imperialiſts, and of the victorious Army of the King of Sweden. Yet a hope not only upon weake, but ſometimes upon very vaine grounds, ſtirres up the ſpirit; how much more upon certain grounds of good ſucceſſe, as that of the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>Sinne ſhall not have the dominion over you, for yee are not under the Law but under grace, therefore let not ſinne raigne over you,</hi> as much as to ſay, Play the men, fight valiantly the Lords battailes againſt ſinne and Satan, for yee ſhall have the victory in the end.</p>
                              <p>The feare of Hell is a curbe to hold men in from wickedneſſe I willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, but the knowledge hereof is not naturall, but by revelation divine, which to carnall men who live by fight is of little force: Witneſſe the ſtory of the Welch-man who robbing an honeſt man upon the high way, and being told by him, that he ſhould anſwer for it at the day of judgement, ſaiſt thou me ſo (quoth the thiefe) and wilt thou truſt me till that day, then give me thy cloake too. We finde by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, the moſt uncleane perſon, if he meets with never ſo beautifull a piece, yet if he knowes ſhee hath the Poxe; the feare of infection will be of more power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine him then the feare of Hell. Yet God by his word workes in men, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in carnall men) as a taſt of the ſweetneſſe of Heaven, ſo of the bitterneſſe of Hell; the one to erect with hope, the other to awe with feare: and in both reſpects they may be ſaid (in my judgement) to have a taſt of the powers of the World to come. And like as <hi>the Law was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion,</hi> that is, to reſtraine tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as ſome expound it: ſo likewiſe the repreſentation of Gods wrath and jealouſy, may in the ſanctions thereof have good force in this. And in the Godly alſo I make no queſtion, but it is of good uſe; though the love of God, hath in great meaſure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome that ſervile feare; yet as their faith is not ſo perfect, as to be voyd of all doubting, ſo neither is their hope ſo perfect, as to be free from all mixture of feare: But the chaſt feare, the filiall feare, feare of diſpleaſing God who hath been ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto them, is that feare which is predominant in ſuch. And even feare of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly chaſtiſements in this world, is an hedge of thornes keeping them within
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56120:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the goodneſſe of the Lord, and farre more forcible then the feare of Hell fire to the carnall Goſpeller. And this Author doth carry himſelfe very unlearnedly in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding their differences, and diſcourſing of the feare of God without diſtinction; As if the feare of of God in <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 1. were the feare of Hell, and the feare of the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 17. As if there were no difference between ſervile feare, and a filiall feare. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo confident of his ſalvation, that he profeſſeth his perſwaſion, <hi>That neither death, nor life, nor Angells, nor Principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhould be able to ſeparate him from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus. Rom.</hi> 8. 38. Yet 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Knowing therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the feare of the Lord we perſwade men. Gen.</hi> 20. 11. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, <hi>The feare of God is not in this place,</hi> therefore they will kill me for my Wifes ſake. But doth this Author carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as it becomes a Divine, to take <hi>the feare of God,</hi> whereſoever he meets with it, for no other feare then the feare of Hell. Certainly the <hi>feare of God is as a fountaine of life to avoyd the ſnares of death.</hi> Yet I preſume though our Saviour was nothing affected with the feare of hell, yet was he never a whit the leſſe forward to all holy coverſation; Nor <hi>Paul</hi> neither, though he profeſſeth, <hi>I know whom I have truſted &amp;c.

                              <p>That <hi>feare and trembling Phil.</hi> 2. 13. is not feare of hell, but humility, ſtanding in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to preſumption of a mans own ſtrength; as appears by the reaſon, wherewith the Apoſtle enforceth that exhortation of his, <hi>To worke out our ſalvation with feare and trembling:</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>God it is that worketh in you both the will and the deed, according to his good pleaſure.</hi> And if <hi>the working out of our ſalvation goes not on handſomely, except the feare of miſsing it, be an ingredient to the worke,</hi> as this Author diſcourſeth; then it ſeemes his feare of miſſing makes him goe on more handſomely, in working out his ſalvation, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, or our Saviour did: for I no where find that our Saviour fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the miſſing of it; no nor <hi>Paul</hi> neither, after his converſion; though he knew full well, that conſcionable carriage in his vocation, was a neceſſary meanes, without which he could not obtaine it; and therefore profeſſeth, that <hi>he did beat downe his body, and bring it in ſubjection, leaſt Preaching unto others himſelfe ſhould become a caſt away.</hi>

For undoubtedly the decree of Chriſts ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, was abſolute, yet did not this take away either hope or feare: for it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of him, That <hi>for the hope that was ſet before him, he deſpiſed the ſhame,</hi> and alſo, <hi>that he was heard in that which he feared:</hi> though ſinfull feare, and ſlaviſh feare, was farre from him, as farre as hell from heaven. The object of Chriſtian hope is not only a good thing poſſible to be had, but certainly to be had. For we read of <gap reason="foreign">

A full aſſurance of hope, were it of a thing uncertaine, how inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent were it for the Apoſtle to compare it to an Anchor 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 3. <hi>He that hath this hope purgeth himſelfe as he is pure.</hi> Was this a wavering hope, grounded upon an uncertain apprehenſion? Marke the verſe immediately preceding, and conſider whether it doth not enforce the contrary. <hi>Now are we the ſonnes of God, but yet it is not made manifeſt what we ſhall be: And we know</hi> (marke his aſſurance well) <hi>that when he ſhall be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> The deſcription of feare, is anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the deſcription of hope. we were wont to define the one by the expectation, <hi>appropinquantis boni,</hi> the other by the expectation <hi>imminentis mali.</hi> Yet it is true the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the one is ſuch a good, as in its own nature is poſſible to be obtained, and of the other, is ſuch an evill as is poſſible to be avoyded. But like as eternall life is not attainable without faith and repentance; ſo neither is damnation avoydable, but by faith and repentance. And we willingly grant that both eternall life is attainable, and damnation avoydable by faith and repentance, yet undoubtedly the unprevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able nature of an evill, doth no way hinder a mans feare, unleſſe he knowes it to be unpreventable. Neither doth the knowledge of the unpreventable nature thereof hinder feare, but improveth it rather, in as much as in ſuch a caſe, there is no place for any hope to qualify the feare. And this is farther apparent by the example of the Devills, of whom Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith <hi>That they believe and tremble,</hi> ſurely they doe not tremble the leſſe, becauſe their torment is unpreventable by the appoyntment of of God: yet doe they not give themſelves up to their ſorrowes, but cryed out to our Saviour, <hi>What have we to doe with thee thou Jeſus the Sonne of God, art thou come to torment us before our time: Caeſars</hi> caſe was not the caſe of feare, for feare is the apprehenſion of an evill before it come; but <hi>Caeſar</hi> was ſo farre from fearing, that though he were

forewarned to take heed of the Ides of March (as I remember) leaſt they proved fatall to him, was ſo far from apprehending any feare thereupon, that going that day to the Senate Houſe, and meeting by the way with him who had given him that warning, he called him by his name, and to ſhew his fearleſſe condition ſayd, <hi>The Ides of March are come;</hi> true S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> quoth the other, but they are not yet paſt. The mortall wound in the Senate Houſe was given him before he feared it; for of thirty and odde wounds there received, it is written that every one of them was mortall.

                                 </gap>, and took care to gather his garments in ſuch ſort about <hi>ut honeſte caderet.</hi> Heaven and hell are ordained by God as the portion, of the righteous the one, of the wicked the other. I hope this Author will not deny but that Heaven (according to his phraſe) was unavoydably obtained by our Saviour, yet this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hindred his hope, but rather confirmed it by caſting out of feare. And the hope of Chriſt is the firſt thing this Author inſtanceth in, while he amplifies the nature of hope; but in his large expatiation thereon, according to his courſe he ſpent ſo much time, that he might well forget it, before he come to the accommodation of it unto his Argument. And indeed hope in Scripture phraſe, is the looking for of Chriſt, and the glory he brings with him; and what a ſenſeleſſe thing is it to conceive, that the more ſure we are of bleſſedneſſe, the leſſe we ſhould expect and look for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it? Doth not our Saviour bid his Diſciples <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 20. not to rejoyce in this, that Devills are ſubdued unto them, but rather to rejoyce in this, <hi>that their names are written in heaven.</hi> Now let any ſober man judge, whether this joy ſhall be of force to expectorate our hope, and not rather to confirme and increaſe it. As for Hell, I know none are aſſured thereof, as of their due portion, but the Devills, yet they feare and tremble never a whit the leſſe for that. But men while they live on earth, not one of them in particular that I know are, or have any juſt ground to be aſſured of their damnation. For albeit faith in Chriſt may well be an aſſurance of mans ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; yet nothing but finall perſeverance in infidelity or impenitency, can be a juſt aſſurance to any man of his damnation. As for the eternall ſtates of men, they are not exiſtent, but only in Gods intention, and conſequently to alter their eternall ſtates, is to alter Gods intentions. Now what Arminian of theſe daies, that is of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learning and judgement, dares boldly affirme, that it is in the power of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to alter Gods intentions. In like ſort with what ſobriety can any man deny, that every man is determined either to ſalvation or damnation, the preſcience of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient hereunto; and we acknowledge that none is ordained by God to be damned, but for finall perſeverance in ſinne unrepented of: none to be ſaved of ripe yeares, but by way of reward for his faith, obedience, repentance. As for power and liberty to chooſe either, let that be firſt rightly ſtated: <hi>Moſes Deut.</hi> 30. 19. (or the Lord rather by him) profeſſeth that he hath ſet before them <hi>life and death;</hi> and exhorts them <hi>to chooſe life,</hi> the meaning whereof is to chooſe that, the conſequent whereunto is life; now that was obedience unto the lawes and holy ordinances of God. Now as touching the power and liberty, to chooſe this, we ſay,</p>
                              <p n="1">1. That this power was given to all in <hi>Adam,</hi> and we have all loſt it in him through ſinne: for we all ſinned in him, as the Apoſtle in expreſſe tearmes profeſſeth <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. The power that we have loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> is no naturall power, but a morall power like unto that whereof the Lord ſpeaketh by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy. Jere.</hi> 13. 23. <hi>Can a Blackamore change his skinne? Or the Leopard his ſpotts? No more can you doe good, that are accuſtomed to evill.</hi> Nor will any ſober man judge that ſuch an impotency as this doth make a man excuſable? In the like ſort our Saviour unto the Jewes: <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5. 44. <hi>How can yee believe that receive Honour one of another, and ſeek not the Honour that comes of God only?</hi> So that this impotency is meerly morall, ariſing from the corruption of their wills. Had a man a will to believe to repent, but withall had no power to believe and repent though he would, here indeed were a juſt cauſe of excuſe: but all the fault hereof is in the will of man. This our <hi>Britaine</hi> Divines at the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort</hi> upon the 3. and 4. Articles of the ſecond Poſition expreſſe in this manner. <hi>The</hi>

Laſtly what meanes this Author to diſcourſe thus hand overhead <hi>of power and liberty to chooſe whether</hi> as if (whatſoever they pretend) their true meaning were, that man hath power to believe and repent without grace. For as for power to believe and repent through Gods grace no man denyes. Why then doth he not try his ſtrength on this point which indeed is the criticall point of theſe controverſies, and wherein it will clearly appeare, whether they differ one iot from the Pelagians. For the queſtion between the Pelagians, and the Catholiques in <hi>Auſtins</hi> dayes was not about the poſſibility of willing or doing that which is good, but only about the act of willing and doing: And herein they granted inſtruction and exhortation requiſite. All the queſtion was about the working of his will, to will and doe that which is good, as appeares by <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his booke <hi>De gratia Chriſti contra Pelag: &amp; Caeleſti: cap.</hi> 6. And repeated againe towards the end, coming to an iſſue of the buſineſſe, after he had diſcovered much concerning <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his opinieon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.</p>
                              <p>But whatſoever his premiſes be, in his concluſion he commonly ſpeakes it home, as herein ſaying, It is cleare <hi>that the abſolute decree, takes away the cheifeſt inducements to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and determents from wickedneſſe,</hi> to wit, becauſe it takes away hope and feare; whence it followeth, that ſeeing Chriſt had hope of heaven, he was not abſolutely deſtinated unto glory. And ſeeing the Devills are ſaid to believe and tremble, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly their damnation is yet preventable, although there is yet this maine difference between reprobate men on earth, and Devills, that though the Devills are aſſured of their reprobation, yet no man either is, or can by any ordinary way be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of his reprobation. I conclude thus, This his Diſcourſe tends mainly againſt all certainty of Salvation: whence it followes, that either he had no certainty of his ſalvation while he was with us, or if he had, it ſtands him upon now to profeſſe that he hath utterly loſt it.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. THe injuriouſneſſe of this Doctrine to Godly life, may farther appeare by theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that follow, one depending upon another.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Abſolute and peremptory decrees are inevitable, whatſoever the things be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which they are exerciſed; and mens everlaſting ſtates, if they be abſolutely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, are altogether undeclinable. <hi>Stat ſali lex indeclinabilis,</hi> the law of deſtiny is undeclinable. And the reaſon is, becauſe it hath an inevitable cauſe, the adamantine decrees of Allmighty God, which are indeclinable two wayes.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Irreverſible, lyable to no repeale (as the Statutes are which are made in our Parliaments:) but ſarre more unalterable then the Lawes of the Medes and Perſians. As I have ſpoken ſo will I bring it to paſſe: I have purpoſed, and I will doe it. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 46. 11. Men doe many times bite in their words againe, becauſe they doe utter things raſhly, and doe repeale their Statutes and Ordinances, becauſe they ſee ſome inconveniences in them, which they could not foreſee: but God never alters or calls in his abſolute decrees becauſe they are all made with great wiſdome and foreſight.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Irreſiſtible. It lies not in the power of any creature to diſanull them. Who hath reſiſted his will? <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 19. Our God is in Heaven: he doth whatſoever he will: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. 3. Whatſoever is once determined by his abſolute will is no wayes alterable by the will of man. It is more poſſible for a man to hinder the riſing of the Sunne, or to ſtay his courſe in the Heaven, to ſtop the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56120:123"/>
of the yeare, and overturne the whole courſe of nature, then to make the leaſt alternation in any of Gods abſolute decrees.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Mens actions about ends, and things determined by an abſolute decree are vaine and fruitleſſe; and the reaſon is, becauſe they cannot make them otherwiſe then they were determined to be; and therefore in vaine doe men labour to obtaine Everlaſting Life and avoid Eternall Death, if there be noe liberty and power in their hands to chooſe Life or Death, but muſt of neceſſity take that which is aſſigned them, be it Life or Death; for by their labour they effect juſt nothing; for if they be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely appointed to diſtruction, their hearing, reading, praying, almes-giving, and mourning for their ſinnes cannot poſſibly procure their Salvation; damned they muſt be. And if they be abſolutely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned to Savation, their neglect of holy dutyes, their ignorance, their love of pleaſures and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in a courſe of ungodlineſſe, cannot bring them unto damnation; they muſt be Saved: If ſomany Soules in a Pariſh be in this manner decreed to Heaven or Hell, the Miniſter Preacheth in vaine, and the people heare in vaine. For there cannot one Soule be Saved, for all their paines, which is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Hell, nor one Soule be caſt away by their negligence, which is appoynted for Heaven. It is in vaine for thee (ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Saul)</hi> to kicke againſt the pricks: <hi>(i.)</hi> to endeavour by thy perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſlaughters to root out my Church in the world; becauſe the preſervation of it is abſolutely <note place="margin">Act. 9. 5.</note> decreed in Heaven. Teaching us by that ſpeech, that a mans labour in any thing whatſoever, is never profitable, except it be exerciſed about an end attainable thereby, and without it not poſſible.</p>
                           <p n="3">3, Men are not willing to be employed in fruitleſſe actions if they knowe it. I ſo runne (ſaith the Apoſtle) not as uncertainely; ſo fight I, not as on that beates the Ayre: but I keep under my <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 25.</note> body and bring it into ſubjection, leaſt that by any meanes, when I have Preached unto others I my ſelfe ſhould be a caſt-away. The meaning is, I endeavour to keepe Gods commandements, I fight with the tentations of the Divill the allurements of the world, and mine owne corruptions, I keep my body low by watchings and faſtings, and other ſevere acts of holy diſcipline. But <hi>Cui bono?</hi> doe I all this at randome? Uncertaine whether I ſhall get any good, or prevent any miſchiefe hereby? No, but I doe this, as one that is ſure that by ſo doing, I ſhall obtaine Eternal Life, and otherwiſe I cannot eſcape Eternall Death: intimating in theſe words the common diſpoſition of men, which is to labour where ſome proportionable good is to be gotten, or evill prevented, otherwiſe to ſpare their heads and their hands too.</p>

                              <p>TO talke of the decrees divine as things evitable or inevitable, is very abſurd: for things denominated evitable or inevitable are only things to come, not yet exiſtent; but ſuch are not decrees divine, they are as everlaſting as God himſelfe without any begining of duration. As for the things decreed by God, they are of a double nature. For God hath decreed ſome things to come to paſſe neceſſarily, other things to come to paſſe contingently. Now thoſe things that come to paſſe contingently do ſo come to paſſe (and that by the decree of God) as joyned with a poſſibility not to come to paſſe, and conſequently to come to paſſe ſo as ioyned with a poſſibility to be avoyded. Such are Salvation and damnation in as much as God hath annexed theſe as rewards, unto finall perſeverance in faith and repentance, the one; unto finall perſeverance in ſinne unrepented of, the other. This is the undeclinable law of Gods decree, that, <hi>whoſoever believes ſhall be Saved</hi> 
                                 <note place="margin">Mar. 16. 16.</note> 
                                 <hi>and whoſoever believes not ſhall be damned.</hi> But we doe not ſay, that this is the whole decree of predeſtination and Reprobation, with the Remonſtrants, and with this Author. But that there is another decree of God, the effect whereof is as undeniable, as the effect of the former, which this Author diſſembleth throughout: and the effect of this decree is not conditionall like unto the effects of the former decree, but abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute. And it is the more ſtrange that this Author ſhould ſo much inſiſt upon the effects of the former, &amp; nothing at all on this: wheras the effects of the former nothing at all ſerve his turne, but through meere confuſion: for he carieth the matter ſo as if we maintained that God doth decree to diſpenſe Salvation and damnation abſolutly according to the meare pleaſure of his will, and not conditionally as he finds his creatures either dying in faith or dying in ſinne, which is moſt untrue. And yet his uſuall courſe to relieve himſelfe in the caſe of impertinency and extravagancy is to fly to the effects of the other decree which we willingly confeſſe to be abſolute; yet hath he no appetite to deale directly in the diſcuſſing thereof. Now we profeſſe that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56120:124"/>
as God according to the meere pleaſure of his will beſtowes faith and repentance on ſome and denies it to others, according to that of the Apoſtle. He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. So God from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting decreed, according to the meere pleaſure of his will to beſtowe the gift of faith &amp; repentance on ſome &amp; deny it to others. All the decrees of God we acknowledge to be unchangeable from within, irreſiſtible from without. Yet this Author applyes theſe attributes only to Gods abſolute decrees, intimating that it is otherwiſe with Gods conditionall decrees: which conceit of his ſavoureth of the ſame learning and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the reſt. Beſides it is his courſe hand over head to talke of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Gods decrees, into decrees abſolute, and decrees conditionall: whereas the decrees of God as touching the acts of God willing, admit noe ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction; the act of Gods will being allways abſolute and never conditionall, as both <hi>Piſcator</hi> theologically hath proved againſt <hi>Uorſtius</hi> and <hi>Bradwardine</hi> moſt ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtically hath demonſtrated; and by other reaſons may be demonſtrated and made as cleare as the Sunne; ſome of which reaſons I have formerly mentioned in this diſcourſe: only <hi>quoad res volitas</hi> as touching the things willed this diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath place; as both D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

Now in this ſenſe we doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that Gods decrees of Salvation and damnation are abſolute, but mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conditionall; ſo that this Author doth but fight with his own ſhadow in this his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation, making as ſhamefull a miſtake as ever <hi>Don Quixot</hi> did, when he conceived the Barbars baſon to be the Helmet of <hi>Mambrino,</hi> and fell furiouſly upon him, in a zeale of martiall glory, to recover <hi>Spolia opima,</hi> ſo fat and rich ſpoyles. By the way obſerve, to alter Gods abſolute decrees, is no other thing, then to alter that which is once determined by Gods abſolute will. For after this different manner doth this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor expreſſe one and the ſame thing in this Section. Now conſider, <hi>is not the riſing of the Sunne the courſe of Heaven, the revolution of the yeare, the whole courſe of nature,</hi> ſome of theſe things which are determined by Gods abſolute will? With what giddineſſe then doth he affirme that to hinder or ſtay or overturne any of theſe is more poſſible then to make alteration in Gods decrees; ſeeing to make alteration in Gods decrees is but to alter things which God hath once determined by his abſolute will. But as for Salvation and damnation theſe are not determined by God, like as the riſing of the Sunne, the courſe of Heaven the revolutions of the yeare, and the whole courſe of nature. For theſe are determined by God to come to paſſe abſolutly; but the Salvation or damnation of man are determined by God to come to paſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. And accordingly mans ends are not determined by an abſolute decree, like unto the riſing of the Sunne. For the riſing of the Sunne is by God determined to come to paſſe abſolutely, ſo are not the ſpeciall ends of men, to wit, Salvation and damnation (for theſe are the ends of men which this Author ſpeakes of) theſe (as I ſaid) are determined to come to paſſe not abſolutely but conditionally: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mens actions hereabouts, are not vaine and fruitleſſe: And the reaſon is becauſe mans Salvation is determined to befall him only in caſe he believe and repent and become ſtudious of good works: In like ſort damnation is determined to none of ripe yeares, but in caſe he gives off all care of faith repentance and good workes. Did God determine a man ſhall be Saved whether they be good or evill, like as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the Sunne ſhould riſe whether men ſleepe or wake, whether they be idle or well occupied (for ſo he makes his Sunne to ſhine and the raine to fall upon the juſt and unjuſt) then indeed mans actions in furthering their Salvation were vaine and fruitleſſe. But the Antecedent is a notorous untruth. For our Saviour hath profeſſed in expreſſe termes that whoſoever believeth ſhall be Saved, and whoſoever believes not ſhall be damned. As for the liberty and power of a man to performe faith and repentance, whether this be granted unto all? Is an other queſtion, which this Author might have diſcuſſed had it pleaſed him, and taken upon him to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine univerſall grace; but he declines this throughout, like as others of this ſect too, fearing therein ſome precipice. And herein we are willing to grant that God hath abſolutely determined that ſome ſhall believe and repent, as he hath determined
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56120:124"/>
the Sunne riſing, not upon any condition in man, but according to the meere plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his will, beſtowing the grace of faith on ſome, and denying it to others. For if God did beſtow faith on man upon condition of ſome precedent work in man, then grace ſhould be given according to mens works (that is in the phraſe of the Antients) according to mens merits, which is direct Pelagianiſme, and condemned in the Synod of Paleſtine above twelve hundred years agoe. But this Author carrieth himſelfe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prepoſterouſly, thus confounding two queſtions into one: the one, Whether ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be determined by God, to be conferred abſolutely on man? Which we deny as much as himſelfe doth. The other is, Whether faith and repentance be determined by God to be conferred on man conditionally? Which we maintaine; and wonder not a little that this Authors ſtomack (working like the raging Sea) chiefly againſt this, yet dares not come to the debating of this, no nor ſo much as in plaine termes to ſpeake out his opinion, and profeſſe, that the reaſon why God beſtowes faith on one, and not on another, is becauſe he finds ſome diſpoſition or work in him, on whom he beſtowes faith, which he finds not in another to whom he denies it. Yet he goes on moſt ridiculouſly in the ſame tenour, ſaying. <hi>If they be abſolutely appoynted to deſtruction, their hearing, reading, praying, almeſgiving, and mourning for their ſinnes, cannot poſsibly procure their ſalvation: damned they muſt be.</hi> But we ſtill deny that men are abſolutely appoynted to deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we willingly grant the elect are abſolutely appointed unto grace, namely to have regeneration, faith and repentance to be conferred upon them, and that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, not upon any foregoing condition performed by them, but according to the meere pleaſure of God; but as for ſalvation, that is appointed to be beſtowed upon them, only by way of reward of foregoing faith, repentance, and good workes, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve by the way, how he conſiders not the contradictious nature of that which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes unto us. As firſt that we deny man to have any liberty or power to chooſe life and death. And ſecondly, that we maintain, <hi>That their hearing, reading, praying, almeſgiving, and mourning for their ſinnes, cannot poſſibly procure their ſalvation;</hi> which is to imply, that they have power to <hi>heare, read, pray, give almes, and mourne for their ſinnes,</hi> and conſequently that they have power to chooſe life or death. For to chooſe life or death, is no other then to embrace ſuch courſes, as by the ordinance of God, lead to life or death. Now ſuch <hi>are hearing, reading, praying, giving aſmes, and mourning for ſinnes;</hi> for theſe courſes are the way to everlaſting life. Yet as touching the latter, well we may ſay that Reprobates can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heare, nor read, nor pray, nor give almes as they ought, nor mourne for their ſins; yet ſurely we are ſo farre from ſaying, that theſe courſes cannot poſſibly procure ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that on the contrary rather, we are ready to profeſſe that theſe courſes rightly uſed, ſhall infallibly procure ſalvation; for there is none more pretious mourning, then to mourne for ſinne; and our Saviour hath pronounced them bleſſed, adding, that they ſhall be comforted. Was it ever heard amongſt us, that men ſhould be damned for reading, hearing, praying, and mourning for their ſinnes? Yet the word of God teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, that men may houle, yet be farre enough off from mourning for their ſinnes, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>They cryed not unto me when they houled upon their beds: they aſſembled themſelves for corne and wine, &amp; they rebelled againſt me.</hi> And if men be damned notwithſtanding ſuch mourning, I ſhould think it is nothing ſtrange. Of the ſame tenour is that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. <hi>If they be abſolutely ordained to ſalvation, their neglect of holy duties, their ignorance their love of pleaſure, and continuance in a courſe of ungodlineſſe, cannot bring them to damnation;</hi> as if this were our doctrine: whereas to the contrary we maintain, that from election flowes holineſſe. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Who hath elected us in Chriſt, that we ſhould be holy.</hi> And faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 48. <hi>As many believed as were ordained to everlaſting life.</hi> And 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>God hath elected you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation, by ſanctification of the ſpirit, and faith of the truth.</hi> And indeed our profeſſion is, That Gods purpoſe is to beſtow ſalvation by way of reward of faith, repentance, and good workes: And accordingly there is no other aſſurance of election, then by faith and holineſſe. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 3, 4. <hi>Remembring the work of your faith, the labour of your love, and the patience of your hope, knowing beloved brethren, that ye are elect of God.</hi> And therefore Saint <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts Chriſtians, <hi>To make their election and vocation ſure, by joyning ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue with their faith, and with vertue knowledge, and with knowledge temperance, and with temperance patience, and with patience Godlineſſe, and with Godlineſſe Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kindneſſe, and with Brotherly kindneſſe Love.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7. 10.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56120:125"/>

For the Prophet <hi>Eſaiah</hi> thus complaines, and that as ſome conceive in the perſon of Chriſt, <hi>Then I ſaid, I have laboured in vaine, I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought, and</hi> 
                                 <note place="margin">Iſai. 49. 4.</note>

So why may not Preaching be in vaine, which is a ſowing of ſeed alſo. Yet in reſpect of Gods end, it is not in vaine: For he hath the ends he aimed at; for even in them that periſh, there ariſeth <hi>a ſweet ſavour unto God</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. As well as in them that are ſaved. And if they ſtumble at the word being diſobedient, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> telleth us, that hereunto they were odained 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8.

Thereby to excuſe themſelves: yea &amp; ſometimes they may be the better for it, in reſpect of an outward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity, only it is in vain in reſpect that ſalvation is not obtained by them though the Goſpel &amp; the Miniſtry thereof be a means te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, in as much as it openeth the way of ſalvation, &amp; diſcovereth all falſe waies. But <hi>paines</hi> for obtaining ſalvation, and Hell, are ill joyned together; For therefore hell is their portion becauſe they neglect the means of ſalvation, and take no paines about it
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56120:125"/>
at leaſt <hi>good paines.</hi> For our Saviour plainly tells us of ſome that <hi>they ſhall ſeek to enter in at the ſtraight gate, and ſhall not be able Luk.</hi> 13. 24. It ſeems they took ſome paines, though they were not able to enter. We are accounted Predeſtinarian Heretiques for ſaying ſo much; but I hope he will not reckon our Saviour too amongſt the number. So <hi>Eſay</hi> 58. 2. <hi>Yet they ſeeke mee daily, and will know my waies, even as a Nation that did righteouſly and had not forſaken the ſtatutes of their God: They aske of me ordinances of juſtice. They will draw neer unto God, ſaying. Wherefore have we faſted and thou ſeeſt it not? We have puniſhed our ſelves &amp; thou regardeſt it not.</hi> Here is devotion and paines too, in the way thereof, but I think they had never a whit the better intereſt in heaven for this. Doth this doctrine alſo ſavour of the Predeſtinarian hereſy? As for that pretended paſſage out of <hi>Acts</hi> 9. <hi>It is in vain for thee to kick againſt the pricks,</hi> I find no ſuch ſaying of Chriſt to <hi>Saul</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                                    <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                                 </gap> an hard thing; for ſhall he not wound himſelfe that doth ſo, more then hurt the pricks themſelves? So was <hi>Paul</hi> by thoſe perſecuting courſes of his, in the high-way to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; yet it is true alſo, Gods Church is nothing damnified by the perſecutions and martyrdomes of Gods Saints. For <hi>ſanguis Martyrum ſemen Eccleſiae;</hi> one is cut off, but many riſe up in the place of a few. Like as a ſeed of corne falls into the ground and dyes; but a blade ſprings out of that one that dyes, and brings forth an eare of many graines. By the way I am wondrous glad to heare the acknowledgement of a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous truth, to breake forth out of the mouth of this Author ere he is aware, namely, That the preſervation of Gods Church is abſolutely decreed in heaven. For marke I beſeech you, wherein the preſervation of Gods Church conſiſts. 1. One is in preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them that are called from Apoſtacy. If this be abſolutely decreed, then the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance of men in the ſtate of grace is abſolutely decreed; and conſequently it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely maintained; And if perſeverance in faith be abſolutely maintained; then faith it ſelfe was abſolutely wrought, and abſolutely decreed to every one that enjoyeth it. 2. Another is the reſtraining of Tyrants from perſecuting the profeſſors of Chriſt: If this be abſolutely decreed, then the free actions of men are abſolutely decreed by God: for to abſtaine from perſecuting is undoubtedly a free action of man. 3. But in caſe both Tyrants are permitted to rage, and many are permitted to fall away; And all are mortall and muſt dye; therefore the next effectuall meanes of preſerving the Church, is the raiſing of others in their place to profeſſe the Goſpell. Now this is wrought by the effectuall calling and converting of men unto faith in Chriſt, and conſequently the effectuall calling and converting of men is abſolutely decreed by God. Thus truth hath prevailed over the mouth of errour, to make it teſtify for Gods truth and againſt errour: <hi>Magna eſt veritas, ut praevalebit.</hi> Here this Author hath raiſed ſpirits againſt himſelfe improvidently; let him try how he can lay them, and conjure them downe againe. 3. I come unto the third. I willingly grant that men are not willing to be exerciſed about fruitleſſe actions; And as for the actions ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> as they were not fruitleſſe to him; ſo I make no queſtion but that they are in like manner profitable to all that performe them, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, namely the actions of mortification. We have Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> word for it, which is of ſome force (if ſo be he be not reputed among the number of Predeſtinarian heretiques, as well as <hi>Auſtin</hi> and our Divines) <hi>If by the ſpirit you mortify the deeds of the fleſh, ye ſhall live.</hi> Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> goes beyond deſire: yet <hi>Nehemiah</hi> commends himſelfe to God in this manner. <hi>We that deſire to feare thy name.</hi> And the holy Prophet <hi>Eſay. The deſire of our hearts is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> 
                                 <note place="margin">Nehem. 1. Eſ. 26. Heb. 13.</note>

We deſire to live honeſtly.</hi> And to fight with the temptations of the Devill, the allurements of the World, and a mans own corruptions, is undoubtedly a manifeſt token of a true Souldier of Chriſt Jeſus. And mortification in ſpeciall; ſuch need not doubt, but that they ſhall cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the fleſh, with the affections and luſts. <hi>For they that walke in the ſpirit, ſhall not fulfill</hi>

                           <p>TO be exerciſed in fruitleſſe affaires, it is both a folly and a miſery. 1. A folly, for, <hi>de ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſari is nemo ſapiens deliberat,</hi> ſaith the Philoſopher. And our Saviour ſpeaking of things above our power; <hi>Cur eſtis ſolliciti?</hi> ſaith he to his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 27. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 25, 26. Why take ye thought about ſuch things? Which is as much as if he had ſaid, It is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of folly in you, to trouble your ſelves about ſuch things, as lye not in your liberty. 2. A mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery in the opinions of all men, as the fable of <hi>Syſiphus</hi> implies, who (as the Poets feigne) is puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for his robberies in hell, with the rolling of a great ſtone to the top of a ſharpe hill, where it cannot reſt, but preſently comes tumbling downe againe. The Morall of that fable is, that it is a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a torment fit for Hell; for a man to be ſet about any worke that is fruitleſſe and vaine. Men will rather be exerciſed in high and hard imployments, that produce proportionable ends; then pick ſtrawes, play with feathers, or with <hi>Domitian,</hi> ſpend their time in flapping or killing of flies, or doe any other eaſy workes, which end in nothing but ayre and emptineſſe, except they be fooles or ſelfe-tormentors. And therefore when <hi>Balaam</hi> once ſaw that the Lord had fully determined to bleſſe Iſraell, and that all his Sorceries could not effect the contrary; he preſently gave over, and ſet no more enchantments; And reaſon teacheth every man to doe the like.</p>
                           <p>If any man were fully poſſeſt with a perſwaſion that this temporall eſtate were determined in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that he ſhould be worth juſt ſo much, neither more nor leſſe; he would conclude, that his care and paines could not profit him, nor his idleneſſe impoveriſh him: and ſo would be quickly perſwaded to take his eaſe. And if it were evident, that every Common-wealth had a fatall period, beyond which it could not paſſe, and ſhort of which it could not come, and that all occurrences good or bad, were abſolutely preordained by the Almighty, then the King would call no Parliament, uſe no Privy Counſell: for there would be no uſe of them at all. As once a famous Privy-Councellor told our late Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> men would neither make lawes nor obey them, but would take the Councell of the Poet.</p>

                           <p>From theſe three premiſes laid together, it followes directly, that the doctrine of an abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, which determines mens ends preciſely; is no friend to a Godly life. For if events abſolutely decreed be unavoydable; if mens actions about unavoydable ends be unprofitable; it in unprofitable imployments men will have no hand willingly: men that know and conſider this, will have nothing to doe with the practice of Godlineſſe. For their ends being abſolutely pitched and therefore una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydable; they will conclude, that their labour in Religion will be unprofitable, and ſo will not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in it at all.</p>
                           <p>That which hath been ſaid, may be yet farther confirmed by two witneſſes. The one of them is by two witneſſes.

                              <hi>fovet: ſed etiam in dulget malitiae.</hi> If any man (ſaith he) ſhould ſpeake thus to people; If there be any among you that believe not, it is becauſe ye are ordained to deſtruction; this man would not only cheriſh ſlothfulneſſe, but wickedneſſe alſo. Which is as much to ſay (me thinkes) as this; If a man ſhould ſet out the doctrine of abſolute reprobation in its colours, and explaine it to a people in a cleare and lively faſhion, he would hereby open a doore to liberty and prophaneneſſe.</p>
                           <p>The other witneſſe is a man of another ſtampe, the miſerable <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Turing,</hi> of whom it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by <hi>Heiſterbachius,</hi> that being admoniſhed by his friends, of his vitious and dangerous conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation <note place="margin">

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56120:126"/>
things ſhall be brought to paſſe contingently: As the buying of the Prophets bones by <hi>Joſiah, Cyrus</hi> his dimiſſion of the Jews out of Babylon to goe to their own Country: the contumelious uſages of Chriſt by <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> together with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles and people of Iſrael, were neceſſary in reſpect of Gods decree; it being expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtified by the Apoſtles with one mouth, that all theſe were gathered together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Sonne of God, to doe what Gods hand, and Gods Counſell prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be done. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 28. Yet who is ſo impudent as to deny, that all theſe did freely, whatſoever they did againſt Chriſt. In like ſort you know what was the courſe of proceedings againſt Proteſtants in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> daies, when they were convicted by Eccleſiaſtiques of ſuch opinions, which they accounted hereticall, and which were made capitall by Law of the Land: then they were delivered over unto the ſecular power, to be put to death. So that herein, to wit, firſt in making ſuch bloudy Lawes. Secondly, in executing them for the eſtabliſhment of Popiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The Kings gave their power to the Beaſt, that is, implyed their Regall power and authority to the countenancing of Romiſh Religion: this undoubtedly was a contingent thing. Yet was this determined by God (as the Scripture teſtifies <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 17.) <hi>God hath put in their hearts</hi> (that is in the hearts of the tenne Kings) <hi>to fulfill his decree, and to be of one conſent, and to give their Kingdome unto the Beaſt, untill the word of God be fulfilled.</hi> Againe, ſuppoſe God hath determined my ſalvation; yet if he hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſave me no other way then is revealed in his word, namely, <hi>by growing in</hi>

But <hi>Paul</hi> perceiving this, and the dangerous condition of it unto the reſt, as that which would bereave them of the ordinary meanes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, <hi>he ſaid to the Centurion and the Souldiers, except theſe abide in the ſhip, ye cannot be ſafe.</hi> Did not <hi>Paul</hi> feare the failing af his own credit and reputation? Who having before aſſured them, and that by the meſſage of an Angell of their ſafe coming to land; now on the other ſide tells them, that unleſſe the Marriners abide in the ſhip, they could not be ſafe? Nothing leſſe; neither did the Captaine and Souldiers fly in his face, as an impoſtor, and one that had abuſed them; as by this Authors dictates they might, eſpecially if he had had the Catechiſing of them; but rather of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conceiving it an unreaſonable thing ſo to depend upon the promiſe of man or Angell, as not to uſe the beſt meanes that lay in their power: Forth with the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let it fall away, chooſing rather to looſe their boat (which yet was of good uſe too) then their Marriners. This was not all, but <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth ſpirituall meanes, and by exhortation comforteth them, that ſo they might take heart, and the better ſet themſelves to the uſe of the beſt meanes, not weakely but couragiouſly for their preſervation. <hi>This is the Fourteenth day that y e have tarried, and continued faſting receiving nothing. Wherefore I exhort you to take meat, for this is for your ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, for there ſhall not an hayre fall from the head of any of you. And when he had thus ſpoken he</hi>
                                 <pb n="234" facs="tcp:56120:127"/>
                                 <hi>tooke bread, and gave thankes to God in preſence of them all, and brake it, and began to eate. Then were they all of good courage and they alſo tooke meat. Well at length the ſhip brake, and the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion commanded, that they that could ſwim ſhould caſt themſelves first into the Sea, and goe out to Land; and the others ſome on boards, and ſome on certaine pieces of the Ship.</hi> Here to the end we ſee no meanes neglected; And ſo <hi>it came to paſſe</hi> (to wit by uſe of ſuch meanes) <hi>that they all eſcaped to Land.</hi> Yet was the promiſe of their Salvation made to <hi>Paul</hi> in an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute forme, ſo is not the promiſe of Salvation made to us. Now I leave it to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to judge of the wiſdome of this Authors diſcourſe. Yet <hi>non</hi> deliberation is no ſuffitient evidence of the needleſſe condition of meanes. For <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſayth that <hi>Ars non deliberat,</hi> not becauſe he uſeth no meanes to bring about his ends, but becauſe the Artificer which is his crafts-maſter, is not to ſeeke of the meanes. For the ſame reaſon deliberation is not incident unto God, his wiſdome is nothing the leſſe in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning congruous meanes to bring about his intended ends. As for that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Cur eſtis ſolliciti de veſtitu?</hi> Surely tis not of any thing above our power in reſpect of uſe of meanes; Indeed to ad one Cubit to our ſtature is not in our power, neither doe I know any that take thought thereof, But it is no more in mans power to bleſſe his owne cares and labours for the procuring of himſelfe meat, drinke, rayment, then it is in his power to adde a cubit or two unto his ſtature. Therefore it becomes us not <gap reason="foreign">

                                 </gap> that is, to diſtract our ſelves with carking cares, as touching the end of our affaires, but he forbids us not to be carefull in the uſe of means. For to this purpoſe God would not have <hi>Adam</hi> to be idle in Paradiſe, he muſt dreſſe the Garden, though the thriving of ought thereby was not ſo much by his care as by Gods providence. And therefore he hath given us ſix dayes to worke and commands us to doe all our works therein; but as for the iſſue of our labours, leave that to God &amp; his bleſſing; And whether our labours are ſucceſſefull or not ſucceſſefull, not to trouble our ſelves there abouts. It was ſpoken to the ſingular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                                 <hi>Raynolds</hi> by him that Preached his funerall Sermon, <hi>that he was most carfull of the means, moſt careleſſe of the end.</hi> Thus I have endevored to diſtinguiſh thoſe things which this Authours very judiciouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds. And as it was no folly for <hi>Paul</hi> to doe as he did that all good meanes might be uſed for their preſervation; ſo much leſſe was miſery, nay they had bene in amiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable caſe, had they neglected any due meanes to preſerve themſelves: for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                                 <hi>Paul</hi> (notwithhanding the meſſage delivered unto him by an Angell, and his promiſe therupon made unto the Centution) ſpared not to profeſſe that <hi>unleſse the Mariners staid in the ſhip they could not be Saved:</hi> ſo that this Authours fable of <hi>Syſiphus,</hi> is no better accommodated then the reſt, ſave that herein he may refreſh his reader, &amp; thank him for his curteſie, for repreſenting unto him as in a glaſſe the nature of his proceedings. For in this his diſcourſe he doth very accuratly play the part of <hi>Syſiphus</hi> for he takes great paines inkindeling a fire, but alaſſe he cannot warme himſelfe thereby; he muſt blow his nails ſtill; there is no remedy. And truly I ſee noe reaſon to the contrary, but that a man as profitably beſtowes his paines in picking ſtrawes, or playing with feathers, as this Authour doth in ſuch maner of discourſes. <hi>Domitian</hi> killed flyes, but this Author doth not ſo much as flap a flye; only I confeſſe he doth very energe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically diſcover the nakedneſſe of his owne diſcourſe. And ſuch be the iſſue of thoſe that affect a name by becomming Arminian Proſelits; and ſhew as litle grace in their writings, as it becomes them whoſe growth in perfection (by their owne account) is to appoſe the grace of God Pelagian like, whom <hi>Austin</hi> was bould to call the enemyes of Gods graee; Indeed it was high tyme for <hi>Balaam</hi> to leave his ſorceries when he ſaw the Lord was determined to bleſſe <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For his ſorceries were no meanes to bleſſe them, but to curſe them rather. In like ſort, if I am perſwaded that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted me unto Salvation, it will be high tyme for me to leave off all care of faith repentance and good workes, when this Author ſhall make it appeare, that theſe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are no more conducent (in Gods ordination) unto ſalvation, then <hi>Balaams</hi> ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries were to the bleſſing of Iſrael, but rather the high-way unto damnation, as his ſorceries were to the curſing of the Lords people.</p>
                              <p>I make no doubt (what this Authors creed is to the contrary I care not) but that every mans temporall eſtate is determined in heaven, as well as <hi>Pauls</hi> eſcaping ſafe out of ſhipwrack, and all that were in the ſame ſhip, to the number of two hundred threſcore and ſixteen ſoules, yet both Paul and all the reſt did not take their eaſe, but were vigilant to take all opportunity, to uſe the beſt meanes for their ſafe arrivall at the land; ſome by ſwimming, ſome by ſitting on bords, ſome on one piece of the ſhip
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56120:127"/>
ſome on another, <hi>and ſo</hi> (and not but ſo) <hi>they came all ſafe to land.</hi> And as our Divines in the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> obſerve, albeit the Lord had promiſed <hi>Ezechiah,</hi> he ſhould recover, and fifteen years more ſhould be added to his life, yet he refuſed not the counſaile of the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> in laying a plaſter of figges unto his ſore. We know what was the forme of <hi>Ionahs</hi> Preaching to the Ninivites <hi>Ion.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Yet forty daies and Niniveh ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</hi> Here we have an abſolute forme of ſentence denounced againſt them. <hi>And the people of Niniveh believed God,</hi> Yet did they not give over all courſes for the pacifying <note place="margin">v. 5.</note> of the wrath of God, <hi>but proclaimed a faſt, and put on ſack-cloath, from the greateſt of them to the leaſt of them; the King himſelfe ariſing from his throne, and laying his robe from him, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering himſelfe with ſack-cloath, and ſitting in aſhes, and commanding others to doe the like.</hi> And mark their reaſon. <hi>Who can tell if God will turne and repent, and turne from his fierce wrath that we periſh not.</hi> In like ſort damnation being determined to none, but to ſuch as are <note place="margin">v. 9.</note> finally impenitent: and this being not doubtfully or obſcurely, but clearely revealed unto us in Gods word, ſhall our endeavours to turne unto God by Godly ſorow and repentance, be accounted vaine and fruitleſſe in the judgement of any ſober man? And let this Author look unto it, that theſe Ninivites doe not one day riſe in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt him; And not the Ninivites only, but the Stoicks alſo, who as they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged ſome things <hi>fatalia,</hi> ſo they confeſſed there were ſome things <hi>confatalia;</hi> And this very argument here uſed they commonly called <gap reason="foreign">

It is the bleſſing of God that makes men fat,</hi> and if God hath determined this, and man knows it, will he therefore ſit ſtill and ſtarve himſelfe? <hi>It is the bleſſing of God that makes men rich.</hi> God promiſed as much to the Iſraelites, in caſe they kept his Commandements, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements did not inſtruct them in good husbandry; but where they inſtigated hereby to neglect any uſuall meanes of making themſelves rich? Nothing leſſe, nay God was jealous leaſt in preſumption of their owne wiſe and thriftie courſes they ſhould give the glory of it to themſelves and not to God. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 17. <hi>Beware leaſt thou ſay in thy heart, My power and the strength of mine owne hand hath prepared me this abundance. But remember the Lord thy God: for it is he which giveth thee power to get ſubſtance.</hi> If it be ſayd that God hath not determined to make any man fat, but by feeding; nor any man rich but by labouring in ſome vocation, or other, I anſwer, That neither hath God determined to bring any man to Salvation, <hi>but by Sanctification of the ſpirit and faith of the truth</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13.

But this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor perhaps will reply, that this is not abſolutely to ordaine a period to a ſtate, for as much as the period is brought to paſſe by meanes. Be it ſo; Now let the indifferernt conſider whether we doe maintaine, that the periods of men, to wit Salvation on the one ſide and damnation on the other, are by God brought to paſſe without meanes. Doe we maintaine that God damnes or decreeth to damne any man but for finall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in ſinne? Doe we maintaine that God brings any man to Salvation (if he come to the uſe of reaſon) but by faith repentance and good-workes? But the truth is this Authors ignorance in part, and in part a dexterity that this Sect hath to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found things that differ, is his beſt armour of proofe, to hold up his confidence in ſpending his powder liberally, but without ſhot. For ſalvation is not beſtowed, or damnation inflicted abſolutely, but that meerely upon the foregoing of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; this meerely upon finall perſeverance in ſinne. Only regeneration together with the grace of faith and repentance, is beſtowed abſolutely by God upon whom he will, and denyed to whom he will, according to that of <hi>Paul, He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth.</hi> And it is very ſtrange that this being the criticall poynt, and the moſt momentous poynt of controverſy, and ſuch, the deciſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of carryeth with it the deciſion of all the reſt, this Author ſhould unſhamefacedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it. But ſome there be that hate the light becauſe their workes are evill; but doth it become him to taxe others for declining the triall, when none ſheweth more vile carriage this way then himſelfe? What that Privy-Councellor was, I know not,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56120:128"/>
nor have I any evidence of the truth of the ſtory, but as it lyeth dictated at pleaſure; I have ſhewed how it nothing diſadvantageth our cauſe, though the Author of that ſpeech were not only a Privy-Councellor but a great Divine too. Yet amongſt many good, there might be ſome bad in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes. If that were true which is reported to have been mentioned by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                                 <hi>Lively</hi> in a Lecture of his in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> namely that a certaine Booke was found under a Privy-Councellors pillow, whoſe inſcription was this <hi>De tribus Mundi impoſtoribus, Moſe, Chriſto, Mahumite.</hi> As for fate ſtoicall (to give the Divell his right) I no where find it maintained by any of them ſo as to prejudice mens wills, but by many great ones I find this expreſly denyed and hereof I have already ſpoken more at large.</p>
                              <p>Still he keepes his courſe in impugning <hi>an abſolute decree determining mens ends preciſely:</hi> What ſecret miſteries he conceales in the Word, <hi>preciſely.</hi> I know not; but it is aparent, we maintaine no ſuch determining the Salvation of any man, ſo as to exclude a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life. We both know and teach that <hi>without Holineſſe</hi> (as much as to ſay without a Godly life) <hi>no man ſhall ſee God.</hi> But we further ſay, that this is not wholy the decree of predeſtination, though this Author with his Remonſtrants would faine reſt here: but we farther ſay, that a Godly life is the gift of Gods grace, and that God beſtowes this gift on whom he will; but this Author hath no great luſt to oppoſe us here. The more Equivocall a phraiſe is, the fitter it is to ſerve his turne, that lyes upon advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, to promote error and obſcure truth. And therefore keepes himſelfe to the <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute decree and preciſe determinations;</hi> either not underſtanding or not conſidering, that an abſolute decree may be takendivers waies, either <hi>quoad actum volentis</hi> as touching the act of God willing, or <hi>quoad res volitas,</hi> as touching the things willed, the decree properly ſignifies the act of God willing; but this Author in conſideratly takes it <hi>quoad res volitas</hi> as touching the things willed all along, as appeares by his oppoſſing it <hi>to decree or will conditionall;</hi> And will conditionall with him is ſuch, as when the thing willed is not effected <hi>becauſe the condition is not performed.</hi> They are his owne words in the laſt Section ſave one of his former ſorts of reaſons, the very laſt words. As for example, the will of Saving men is not accompliſhed, becauſe men doe not believe. Then as touching the things willed Gods decrees being conſidered, here alſo ariſe different conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for as much as the things willed are different Grace and Glory; As for Glory and Salvation we doe not ſay that God hath decreed to confer that abſolutly, but only conditionally; yet thereupon he ſtiks throughout. ſuppoſing his adverſaries to maintaine an abſolute decree concerning the conferring of Salvation abolutely, which is moſt untrue, wherein he fights without any adverſary; yet there he diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe very ſtrenuouſly, and layes about him like a mad man. But as for grace, to wit, the grace of regeneration, the grace of faith and repentance; this we readily profeſſe that God doth beſtow it abſolutly, to wit, on whom he will, according to the meere pleaſure of his will. All this, It is the glory of this Author in his diſcourſe moſt juditiouſly to confound; which made him the more to abound in matter, that he might ſeem to ſay ſome thing, when indeed it is nothing, <hi>ſupple</hi> to the purpoſe. And to meet with him in every particular of his concluſion; The events (to wit of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or damnation) are not at all decreed by God to come to paſſe abſolutely, but meerely conditionally, and conſequently not unavoydably, but avoydably rather; like as things that come to paſſe contingently doe come to paſſe with a poſſibility not to come to paſſe, and accordingly God decreed they ſhould came to paſſe contingent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; And conſequently mens actions hereabouts are not unprofitable, nay they are both neceſſary for obtayning the ends here intimated, &amp; ſuch as never faile of obtayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. As for example. <hi>Sanctification of the ſpirit, and faith of the truth,</hi> never faile of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Salvation; for as much as God ordained by theſe meanes to bring men unto Salvation 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13. And by no meanes elſe. And therefore moſt abſurd it is to conceive, that the practiſe of Godlineſſe proves unprofitable, and from ſuch wild pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes the unprofitable nature of the prctiſe of Godlineſſe, can prove no better then a wild concluſion.</p>

For as for <hi>Calvins</hi> opinion to the contrary, that is of no conſideration with him, yea though <hi>Luther</hi> alſo joyne with him in this.

Where the objection made by them of <hi>Marſeiles</hi> againſt <hi>Auſtins</hi> Doctrine of Predeſtination is propoſed thus. <hi>Sed aiunt ut ſcribitis neminem poſſe correptionis ſtimulis excitari, ſi dicatur in conventu Eccleſiae audientibus multis. Ita ſe habet de praedeſtinatione definita ſententia voluntatis Dei, ut alii ex vobis de infidelitate, accepta obediendi voluntate veneritis ad fidem, vel accepta maneatis in fide: caeteri verò qui in pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum delectatione remoramini, ideo nondum ſurrexiſtis, quia nec dum vos adjutorium gratiae mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerantis erexit. Veruntamen ſi qui eſtis nondum vocati, quos gratia ſua praedestinaverit elegendos, accipietis eandem gratiam, qua velitis &amp; ſitis electi: Et ſi qui obeditis ſi praedeſtinati eſtis rejiciendi, ſubtrahentur obediendi vires, ut obedire ceſſitis.</hi> But they ſay (as you write) that no man can be excited by the good of reprehenſion, if in the congregation before many, the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher ſhall thus diſcourſe. Such is the ſentence of Gods will determined as touching predeſtination, that ſome of you receiving the will of obedience, ſhall come from infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity unto faith, or receiving the gift of perſeverance ſhall continue therein. But if there be any among you who are not called, whom God hath through his grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated to be elected, they ſhall receive the ſame grace, whereby to will to be, &amp; to become elect. And if there be any of you, who obey the Goſpell, that are predeſtinated to be rejected, the ſtrength of obeying ſhall be taken from you, that you may ceaſe to obey. Here is the objection againſt it, <hi>Auſtins</hi> doctrine of predeſtination, and reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at full; his anſwer to it followeth at full; but how? Not in denying ought that hereby is implyed concerning his doctrine of Predeſtination, but to the contrary; Firſt ſhewing that this harſh propoſition of things, muſt not deterre us from the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of it; Secondly, ſhewing how the ſame truth may be delivered in a more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate manner. <hi>Ita cum dicuntur</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ita nos a confitenda Dei gratia,</hi> i. e. <hi>quae non ſecundum merita nostra datur, &amp; a confitenda ſecundum eam praedeſtinatione Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;</hi> that is, Theſe things thus delivered, muſt not deterre us from confeſſing Gods grace, which is not given according unto workes, and from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the predeſtination of Saints, according thereunto. Where obſerve I beſeech you how farre he joynes together the doctrine of Gods free grace, with his doctrine of predeſtination according to his Tenet, which here was oppoſed by the ſame
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56120:129"/>
Argument, wherewith the Author in this place oppugneth ours. Manifeſtly giving to underſtand, that his doctrine of Predeſtination could not be impugned as there it is, but withall they that impugne it, muſt deny the freeneſſe of Gods grace, &amp; maintain that it is given according unto works or merits. So that as he anſwers them, ſo we may take liberty to anſwer this Author, and ſay that this argument of his muſt not deterre us from confeſſing predeſtination according to Gods free grace; leaſt ſo we be driven to maintaine <hi>that Grace is given according unto works.</hi> And the reaſon is manifeſt; For if it be not of the meere pleaſure of God, that he beſtowes faith on one, &amp; denyes it unto another, then the reaſon hereof muſt be becauſe God findes ſome better diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in one then in another, and therefore he gives him, that is better diſpoſed, the grace of faith which he denyes unto another. Now this both in <hi>Auſtins</hi> judgement &amp; in cleare reaſon appears to be the maintaining, that grace is given according unto workes, which is condemned in the Synod of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> above 1200 years agoe. Yet <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> reſts not here, but ſhewes how the ſame objection may have place, as well for the overthrowing of preſcience divine, as for the overthrowing of predeſtination divine. We (ſaith he) muſt no more be deterred by this objection from confeſſing, the freeneſſe of Gods grace, and predeſtination divine ſuitable thereunto, then we are hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred from acknowledging Gods fore-knowledge, and ſhewes how the ſame objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be accommodated againſt Gods fore-knowledge, thus. <hi>Sive nunc recte vivatis ſive non recte; tales vos eritis poſtea quales vos deus futuros eſſe praeſcivit, vel boni ſi bonos vel mali ſi malos.</hi> That is, Whether at this time you live well or not well, ſuch you ſhall be as God foreſeeth you will be; either good if he foreſeeth it will come to paſſe, or evill if he foreſeeth you will be evill. Now (ſaith he) if upon the hearing of this, ſome are converted unto ſlothfulneſſe (this is the very objection propoſed by <hi>Calvin</hi> for the matter of it, but the forme is different. For <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith the Preacher, doth <hi>cheriſh ſlothfulneſſe, &amp;c. Auſtin</hi> ſignifieth only, that by ſuch kind of Preaching, men take occaſion of ſlothfulneſſe, and therefore it is fit that <hi>Calvin</hi> ſhould in that ſenſe only be interpreted, ſeeing he only relates in effect that which he findes in <hi>Auſtin,)</hi> ſuppoſe (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi> going on) <hi>That hereupon they runne after their luſt, ſhall we therefore thinke, that to be falſe, which was delivered as concerning Gods fore-knowledge?</hi> Then he tells a Hiſtory of his own experience, namely how one in the ſame monaſtery whereof he was, abuſed in this manner the doctrine of fore-knowledge. For when his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren reproved him he would ſtubbornly anſwer, <hi>Whatſoever I am now, ſurely I ſhall goe out of the World, ſuch as God foreſeeth I will be.</hi> Wherein ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> he ſpeakes truth, but he was ſo farre from profiting by it unto good, that at length he utterly forſooke our ſociety, returning as a dog to his vomit; and yet what he will be, ſaith he, the Lord knoweth. Now who doubts but that our doctrine of juſtification by faith, and not by workes, may be an occaſion to ſome, to abuſe the grace of God unto wantonneſſe; ſuch there were even in the Apoſtles daies: but what? Shall we therefore renounce that doctrine? I am not yet come to the tempering of the manner of propoſing this doctrine, I have more to ſay before I come to that. What difference is there in harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe between theſe doctrines, <hi>If ye doe not believe, therefore ye doe not believe, becauſe God hath ordained you to deſtruction,</hi> and this, <hi>If ye doe not believe, therefore ye doe not believe becauſe God hath not regenerated you:</hi> Let any man ſhew how a doore is open to ſlothfulneſſe, more by the one, then by the other; eſpecially conſidering the ground of all, is mans inability to believe, without this grace of God effectually preventing and working him unto faith. Now this doctine is plainly taught, and that particularly of certain perſons, to their faces: <hi>Ioh</hi> 8.. <hi>He that is of God heareth Gods word, ye therefore heare them not, becauſe ye are not of God.</hi> The phraſe, <hi>to be of God,</hi> I interpret here of regeneration, but both <hi>Auſtin</hi> of old, and our Divines of late, doe interpret of election; and ſo it is preciſely the ſame with the Preaching of reprobation in his true colours, as this Author interprets it, and paſſeth this cenſure upon it, as opening a doore to liberty and profaneneſſe; which may I confeſſe well be occaſionally to carnall men, or to men poſſeſt with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate opinions, yet here it appears plainly, to be in effect the ſame with that which our Saviour himſelfe Preached. But take this withall; as it may be an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſlothfulneſſe, ſo it may be a meanes to humble men, and beat them out of the preſumptuous conceit of their own ſufficiency to heare Gods word, to believe, to repent, and the like; and thereby to prepare them to look up unto God, and to waite for him in his ordinances, if ſo be as the Angell came downe to move the waters in the poole of Betheſda, to make them medicinable; ſo Gods ſpirit
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56120:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may come downe and make his word powerfull to the regenerating of them, to the working of faith, and repentance in them. And I appeale to every ſober mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether to this end tended not the very like Doctrine and admonition propoſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Children of Iſrael in the Wilderneſſe. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Ye have ſeen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh and all his ſervants, and unto all his Land. The great temptations which thine eyes have ſeene thoſe great miracles and wonders. Yet the Lord hath not given you a heart to perceive, and eyes to ſee, and eares to heare unto this day.</hi> For is it not <hi>Moſes</hi> his purpoſe to ſet before their eyes how little they have profited in obedience and thankfulneſſe unto God, and amendment of life, by all thoſe great workes of his, in the way of mercy towards them, and in the way of judgement to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Egyptians? And what was the cauſe of all this, but the hardneſſe of their hearts, and the blindneſſe of their eyes? and to what end doth he tell them, that God alone can take away this hardneſſe of heart, and blindneſſe of mind, which hitherto he had not done? Might he not ſeem to juſtify them, in walking after the hardneſſe of their hearts by this, and harden them therein by this Doctrine of his? like as this Author caſts the like aſperſion in part upon the like Doctrine of ours? Yet <hi>Moſes</hi> paſſeth not for this, ſo he might ſet them in a right courſe, to be made partakers of Gods grace, and that by the miniſtry of the Law, to humble and prepare them for the grace of God, which is the Evangelicall uſe of the Law. And it is remarkable that in the firſt verſe of this Chapter, theſe words are ſaid to be <hi>the words of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which the Lord commanded Moſes to make with the Children of Iſrael in the land of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab, beſide the Covenant which he made with them in Horeb.</hi> Wherefore ſeeing the Covenant made in Horeb, was the Covenant of the Law, it followeth that this Covenant is the Covenant of grace, and theſe words are the words of the Covenant of grace, which is plainly expreſſed in the next Chapter v. 6. <hi>And the Lord thy God, will circumciſe thine heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, that thou maieſt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoule, that thou maieſt live.</hi> And what is the uſuall preparation hereunto but to humble men by convicting them of ſinne, and of their utter inability to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that nothing but Gods grace is able to give them <hi>an heart to perceive, and eyes to ſee, and eares to heare.</hi> But yet becauſe we doe not ſpeake in the ſame meaſure of the ſpirit, and of power, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and our Saviour did, therefore we labour to decline all harſhneſſe as much as lyeth in our power, where we ſee occaſion is like to be taken of offence. Therefore firſt as touching this diſcourſe of <hi>Calvins. If you believe not, therefore it is, becauſe you are already deſtinated unto damnation.</hi> I ſay this is untrue more waies then one. Firſt if he conceives deſtination unto damnation, goes before Gods decree to deny faith: this I utterly deny, and have already proved, that in no moment, of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doth the decree of damnation precede the decree of denying grace. Therefore Gods decree to deny them grace, is rather the cauſe why they believe not then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of damnation. Secondly whether we take it of the one or of the other, or of both, yet the propoſition is utterly untrue. For it doth not follow, that becauſe a man doth not as yet believe, therefore God hath decreed to deny him faith; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath ſo decreed, therefore he denies him faith. For he that believes not to day, may believe to morrow. <hi>Saul</hi> was ſometimes a perſecutor of Gods Church; but was it at that time lawfull to conclude, that becauſe he did not then believe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was deſtinated unto damnation: ſo that the reaſon indeed is, either becauſe God hath not decreed at all to give them faith, or becauſe the time which God hath ordained for their converſion is not yet come. This is ſo cleare that <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelfe were he alive, would not gainſay upon conſideration. Neither doth he juſtify this diſcourſe, but only ſaith, we muſt be more wiſe, then ſo to diſcourſe to our Auditors. But this Author in ſaying, this is to ſet downe our doctrine of reprobation in its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, delivers that which is ſhamefully untrue, and nothing ſutable with our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. More necre to the matter we ſhould ſay rather, That like as therefore a man heareth Gods word becauſe he is of God (that is as I interpret it, becauſe he is rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated of God) ſo therefore men heare them not, becauſe they are not of God, that is not yet regenerated; but yet nevertheleſſe they may be in good time. Yet here alſo there is ſome defect for want of cleare explication of this truth; For will you conclude hence, that non-regeneration is the cauſe of infidelity (as ſome doe in effect)? Why but this is either notoriouſly falſe, or if true it is true in ſuch a ſenſe, as whereby God is no more the cauſe thereof, then a Phyſitian is the cauſe of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, becauſe he will not cure it. For infidelity is a naturall fruit of mans he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:56120:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
corruption, and God alone can cure it, but if he will not, God is not to be ſaid to be the cauſe of any diſobedience iſſuing therefrom, otherwiſe then <hi>per modum non removentis,</hi> by way of not removing the cauſe of it; or <hi>per modum non dantis quod pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiberet,</hi> by way of not curing the cauſe, that is, by not giving faith. Now what harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe there is in this, to as many as doe not concurre with the Pelagians, ſo as in plain termes to profeſſe, <hi>that Grace is given according to mens works;</hi> And the objection framed againſt <hi>Austin,</hi> and grounded upon that doctrine which he acknowledged ranne thus. <hi>Caeteri qui in peccatorum delectatione remoramini ideo nondum ſurrexiſtis, quia nec dum vos adjutorium gratiae miſerantis erexit.</hi> Therefore you are not riſen out of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light you took in ſinne, becauſe the ſuccour of Gods grace hath not raiſed you, not as <hi>Calvin</hi> expreſſeth it. <hi>Therefore you believe not, becauſe ye are ordained to deſtruction.</hi> And this very doctrine, as formerly I ſaid, our Saviour ſpares not to apply to ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <note place="margin">Ioh. 8.</note> perſons, and Preach it to their faces; like as <hi>Moſes</hi> Preacheth the very ſame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to the Children of Iſrael, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 2, 3, 4. Yet <hi>Auſtin</hi> to prevent harſhneſſe doth not like this manner of propoſing it ſo well, <hi>ſeeing it may be and it is fit it ſhould be delivered coveniently thus. Si qui autem ad huc in peccatorum damnabilium delectatione remoramini appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henditis ſaluberrimam diſciplinam. Quod tamen cum feceritis, nolite extolli quaſi de operibus veſtris, aut gloriari, quaſi non acceperitis.</hi> If any of you doe yet continue in the delightfull courſe of damnable ſinnes take hold of wholeſome diſcipline, which when you have done, be not proud thereof as of your own work, or Glory as if you had not received this grace of God. Now what advantagious ſervice this firſt witneſſe hath done him, I am well content the indifferent may judge. I come to his ſecond witneſſe, that is of the Land-grave of Turing, reported by <hi>Hesterbachius;</hi> as I remember it is about the Twelfth Century of yeares ſince our Saviours incarnation. <hi>This man being admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by his friends of his dangerous and vitious courſes, made this anſwer. Si praedeſtinatus ſum nulla peccata poterunt mihi Regnum Caelorum auferre; Si praeſcitus, nulla bona mihi illud valebunt conferre.</hi> It is not the firſt time I have met with this ſtory; not in <hi>Voſsius</hi> only, but in an Arminian Manuſcript; it ſeems they make ſome account of it; yet I ſee no cauſe they ſhould make any ſuch account thereof. It is the common voyce of prophane perſons corrupting the doctrine of Predeſtination to ſerve their own turnes. My ſelfe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber an inſtance of it in my minority, when I was little more then a child; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member both the Perſon whom, and the place where it was delivered, and it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as a ſigne of a prophane heart; yet this <hi>Voſſius</hi> makes uſe of, as an inſtance forſooth of a Predeſtination Heretique. And I wonder why they doe not deviſe as well a <hi>Praeſcientiarian</hi> Hereſy; and that by as good an inſtance as this, of one of <hi>Auſtins</hi> Monkes, who being reproved by his brethren, made the like anſwer as touching Gods <hi>praeſcience,</hi> but yet with more ſobriety, ſaying, <hi>Whatſoever I am now, I ſhall be ſuch as God foreſeeth I will be.</hi> Yet herein as <hi>Auſtin</hi> profeſſeth, he ſpake nothing but truth; but the ſaying of the <hi>Landgrave</hi> implyes a notorious untruth, namely, that if he were predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated he ſhould be Saved, though he continued in his ſinfull courſes; Now this I ſay is a groſſe untruth; For predeſtination is the preparation of Grace (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineth it) and conſequently ſuch as are predeſtinated ſhall be taken off from their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courſes in good time, and by Grace be brought unto Salvation. In like ſort he ſuppoſeth a Reprobate may be truly righteous; whereas <hi>Auſtin</hi> profeſſeth of ſuch, as are not predeſtinate that <hi>God brings none of them to wholſome and ſpirituall repentance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by man is reconciled unto God in Chriſt, what patience ſoever he affords them. Contr. Jul. Pelag. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 4. Nay this kind of Argumentation, drawn from deſtiny Stoicall, wherewith our adverſaries doe uſually reproach our doctrine of Predeſtination, like as the Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians did in the ſame manner reproach Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> doctrine concerning Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſay this argument was in courſe, and profligated in the daies of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and cenſured as <gap reason="foreign">

                                 </gap>, an idle argumentation (as before I mentioned) and it is to be ſeen in <hi>Cicero</hi> his book <hi>De Fato;</hi> and thereupon they diſtinguiſhed of ſome things which they called, <hi>Fatalia,</hi> as victory, and ſome things which they called, <hi>Confatalia,</hi> as all neceſſary meanes requiſite to the getting of the victory. And <hi>Origen</hi> though he be accounted a favourer of our adverſaries Doctrine in his writings, yet he ſhewes the vanitie of this Argument applyed to fate, wherby undoubtedly he meanes provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence divine. For he propoſeth ſuch a kind of objection, as if a ſicke man ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute himſelf from taking Phyſick after this maner. <hi>Either by deſtiny is it appointed I ſhall recover or no; If my deſtiny be to recover I ſhall recover though I uſe no Phyſicke, if my destiny be not to recover, all the Phyſitians in the world ſhal doe me no good.</hi> And the vanity of this is repreſented
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:56120:130"/>
by the like argument in another manner thus: <hi>If it be thy deſteny to beget children, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou uſeſt the company of Woemen or no, thou ſhalt beget children:</hi> And concludes thus; <hi>Ut enim hic ſi fieri non potest ut quis procreat, niſi cum muliere concubuerit, ſic ſi valetudinis recupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio medicinae via efficitur neceſſariò adhibetur medicus.</hi> The Greeke of <hi>Origen</hi> is ſet downe at large by <hi>Turnebus</hi> in his diſputation upon <hi>Cicero</hi> his book <hi>De Fato,</hi> againſt <hi>Ramus.</hi> Now judge you I pray, what colour of detriment to Religion, hath he produced from our doctrine of abſolute Reprobation, and whether his diſcourſe herein is any better then the imagination of a vaine thing.</p>

                           <p>BUt there are two things chiefly, which are ſaid for the vindicating of this opinion from this crimination.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Firſt, that many of them which believe and defend this opinion, are Godly and holy men, and therefore it doth not of it ſelfe open a way to liberty; but through the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men, who pervert the ſweeteſt, and the ſureſt truths revealed in Gods word, to their own damnation.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Reſp.</hi> It cannot (I confeſſe) be denyed, that many of this opinion are Godly men, but it is no thankes to their opinion, that they are ſo; (the true and naturall genius of which is to breed ſloth, to drowne men in carnall ſecurity, and to countenance carnall liberty.) but to ſome thing elſe, either to Gods providence, (who will not ſuffer this doctrine for his own glory and the good of men, to have any great ſtroake in their lives;) or to mens incogitancy, who think not of reducing it <hi>ad praxim,</hi> or drawing concluſions out of it, but reſt in the naked ſpeculation of it, as they doe of many others; or laſtly to ſome good practicall concluſions, which they meet with in the word of God, and apply to their lives (as they doe not the former deductions) ſuch as theſe are for example; Be ye holy as I an holy. Without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God. If ye conſent and obey, ye ſhall eat the good things of the land. Godlineſſe hath the promiſe of this life and of the life to come, and ſuch like. And hence we may learne to meaſure this opinion, not by ſome few of the men that hold it, but by the ſequels, which the Logick even of ſimple men, if they ſhould apply their braines to ponder and conſider it, would fetch out of it. No man that hath thoroughly ſuckt it in, and underſtood the force of it, but will either relinquiſh it, or live according to the naturall importment of it, that is, licentiouſly.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Secondly, it is ſaid, that albeit this Doctrine doth teach, that men are abſolutely elected, or abſolutely rejected; yet it tells no man who in particular is elected, who rejected, (that muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by themſelves and their lives) and ſo it doth not ſtifle holy endeavours in any, but rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them in every man, becauſe it makes them to be ſignes, whereby men muſt and may get the knowledge of their election.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Reſp.</hi> For anſwer to this (in my judgement or the preſent) the ignorance of a mans particular caſe doth not alter the caſe a jot. For he that believes in generall, that many and they the greateſt compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny without compariſon, are inevitably ordained to deſtruction, and a few others unto ſalvation; is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble out of theſe two generall propoſitions, to make theſe particular concluſions, and to reaſon thus with himſelfe; Either I am abſolutely choſen to grace and glory, or abſolutely caſt off from both, If I be choſen, I muſt of neceſſity believe and be ſaved; If I be caſt off I muſt as neceſſarily not believe and be damned, Therefore what need I take thought either way about meanes or end? My end is pitched in Heaven, and the meanes too; my finall perſeverance in faith and my ſalvation; or my continuance in unbeliefe and my damnation. If I lye under this neceſſity of believing, and being ſaved, or of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in unbeliefe, and being damned, in vaine doe I trouble my ſelfe about meanes or end, I have my ſuperſedeas, I may take mine eaſe, and ſo I will, it is enough for me to ſit downe and waite what God will doe unto me.</p>
                           <p>And in this manner (it is to be feared) doe too many reaſon in their hearts, and by this very ground (though they will not perhaps acknowledge it) encourage themſelves to prophaneneſſe. Though men cannot hide their wickedneſſe, yet they will hide their grounds which fleſh them in it, either through modeſty, or to avoyde ſome farther ignominy.

                              <p n="1">1. This anſwer was made by our <hi>Brittaine</hi> Divines in the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort</hi> upon the firſt Article, but ſo, as that they propoſed it not by it ſelfe alone, but joyntly with ſhewing that neither the Nature of our Doctrine doth any way prove any hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance unto pietie; as formerly I have made mention therof.</p>
                              <p>Whereas he ſayth that <hi>many of this</hi> (our) <hi>opinion are Godly men but that is no thankes to their opinion that they are ſo.</hi> I anſwer, that neither doe we give the glory of our Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to our good opinion, nor have cauſe to thanke it therefore; but we give God the Glory both of leading us into this truth amongſt many others, and for that Godlineſſe that is in us alſo. For we acknowledge that God is able to convict our conſciences of that trueth hereof, and yet refuſe to lead us thereby into any Holineſſe at all. Yet let every ſober man judge who are in a fairer way to true Holineſſe, or who are more likely to be in the ſtate of true Holineſſe, they that oppoſe the grace of God in working our wills to faith and repentance, or they that acknowledge it. They who maintaine that God of the meere pleaſure of his will, regenerates us, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueth us with the ſpirit of faith and repentance; or they who maintaine that God doth not give faith and repentance to whom he will. Neither is it the meaning of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                                 <hi>Paul</hi> where he ſayeth God hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; but rather where he findes an abſolute diſpoſition or worke in one, which he finds not in an other. Againe conſider I pray indifferently, who are more likely to be partakers of Gods grace; they who truly magnifie it as the Author of their faith and repentance and of every good worke performed by them, and that in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting manner; or they that pretend to make Gods grace to be the Author of their faith and repentance and every good worke only by giving them power to believe, if they will (which we are able to prove both by the judgment of <hi>Auſtin</hi> and by cleare reaſon to be meere nature and not grace) and accordingly exhorting them to believe, and laſt of all concurring with them to the producing of the act of faith in them in caſe they will; And ſeeing grace proves effectuall only by this ſubſequent manner of operation; whether they doe not plainely mocke God in making him the Author of grace, ſeing in reſpect of this effectuall operation they might as well make him the Author of every ſinfull act as of every gratious act, For it is agreed on all hands that God concurres as well to every ſinfull act as any gratious act. Whereas he ſayth, <hi>The true and naturall genius of our Tenet is to breed ſloth, and to drowne men in carnall ſecurity, and to countenance carnall libertie.</hi> I anſwer theſe words of his are but wind, his reaſons I have already conſidered, and proved them to be of no weight. For they depend partly upon a vaine ſuppoſition, as if we maintained that God hath oppointed men unto Salvation though they live as they liſt, whereas our doctrine is directly contradictious here unto. For we teach that God ordaines no man of ripe yeares to obtaine Salvation <hi>but by Sanctification of the ſpirit and faith of the truth</hi> as we are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught 2 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 2. 13.

It may be as well ſaid that as many repented, as many gave themſelves to worke out their Salvation with feare and trembling to purge themſelues from all pollutions of fleſh and ſpirit, and to perfect Holineſſe in the feare of God, as were ordained to Salvation: partly becauſe we maintaine that God gives faith and repentance and regeneration to whom he will, that is only to thoſe whom he hath choſen, denying the ſame grace and that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely; unto all others, which if it be not true; but that God doth grant it, or ordaine it according to mens workes, then we muſt all turne Pelagians, whom <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls <hi>inimicos gratiae Dei;</hi> And in ſuch a caſe judge I pray whether it be poſſible that ſuch can be partakers of Gods grace, namely, if they are the enemies of Gods grace. Is
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:56120:131"/>
it poſſible that he who partakes of Gods ſanctifying grace ſhould ſtand out in hoſtile oppoſition againſt it? Can we be at once both friends of the Bridegroom and enimies of his grace? Further conſider more particularly wherein doth this conſiſt, which he imputes unto us, <hi>of drowning men in carnall ſecuritie,</hi> is it in denying unto man any grace that he attributes unto him? Surely well we may deny unto every Reprobate ſuch a grace as he himſelfe hates, and impugnes to wit, grace effectually preventing the will, and making man to believe and repent, but if you ſcanne every particular of thoſe which he calleth grace, you ſhall find that we deny not any one of them unto Reprobates more then he doth. This perhaps may ſeeme ſtrange unto you; therefore it deſerves the more carefully to be conſidered; for I doubt not but to make it good. Grace ſubſequent is the only effectuall grace with them, and that conſiſts in Gods concurrence to the working of faith in the heart of man, if man will worke it in him ſelfe. Now dare they ſay we deny, this namely, Gods concourſe to the act of faith, whereas we maintaine with them that God concurres to every act, even to the moſt ſinfull act, that ever was committed ſince the world began; only we are a ſhamed to call this concurrence grace, becauſe it is found to have courſe as well in the producing of evill actions, as in the producing of good. So that if every man in the world ſhould believe, we deny not but that God ſhould concurre with him to the working of that belief, we profeſſe that if every Reprobate in the world will believe, God is ready to concurre with him to the act of that will of that belief. From the conſideration of their grace ſubſequent I ariſe to the conſideration of their grace prevenient, and that is two fold, one is the grace exciting, to wit, by morall admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuaſion, exhortation, This act we are willing to call and account a gratious act, &amp; we doe as willingly acknowledge that God affords it unto all Reprobates (as well as to the elect) within the pale of the Church. For every one that appeares in any Congregation is equally exhorted to believe, to repent, to turne from their wicked wayes. So that hitherto we find no difference. We willingly acknowledge that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates are partakers of theſe operations divine as well as the elect. One grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient remaines, which is <hi>habituall,</hi> and which our adverſaries will have to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall and it conſiſtes in a power to believe and repent, and to will any ſpirituall good whereunto they were excited, and accordingly they call it the enlivening of mans will. This I deliver by experience of what I have ſeen under the hands of ſome of them. Yet they will not acknowledge that all are regenerate; yet what is regeneration, but the infuſion of life ſpirituall, and that chiefly into the will; And they will have the will to be enlivened by grace, which cannot be ſpoken in reſpect of life naturall, therefore it muſt proceed of life ſpirituall, unleſſe they will deviſe a life intermediate between life naturall, and life ſpirituall. Some times they call it a power to believe if they will, and ſuch a power <hi>Auſtin</hi> acknowledgeth common to all, lib. 1. <hi>Gen. ad li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> cap 3. And juſtifies it in his <hi>Retract.</hi> lib. 16.

For <hi>Auſtin</hi> concurred with them ſtill in this particular even then when he wrote his books of <hi>Retractations,</hi> as there it followes in theſe words <hi>Verum eſt enim omnino</hi> (marke by this Emphaſis with what aſſurance of faith he delivered this) <hi>Omnes homines hoc poſſe ſi velint:</hi> Thus farre he goes along with them: but then marke wherin he goes beyond them in theſe words following; <hi>Sed praeparatur voluntas a Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no &amp; tantum augetur munere charitatis ut poſſint;</hi> When he ſayeth, <hi>praeparatur voluntas a Domino,</hi>

And in the very next chapter, c. 12. He calles this prevailing will, <hi>Poſſe</hi> ſimply, <hi>Tantum ſpiritu ſancto accenditur voluntas eorum, ut ideo poſſint, quia ſic velint, &amp; ideo velint, quia Deus ſic operatur ut velint;</hi> Their will is in ſuch meaſure inflamed with the Holy Spirit, that therefore they are able (to doe that which is good) becauſe they will in ſuch a meaſure, &amp; therefore they will in ſuch a meaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God ſo works as to make them willing in ſuch meaſure: <hi>Auſtin</hi> goes on in this manner <hi>Nam ſi in tanta infirmitate vitae hujus ipſis relinqueretur voiuntas ſua, ut in adjutorio Dei manerent ſi vellent, nec Deus in iis operaretur ut vellent inter tot &amp; tantas tentationes infirmitate ſua voluntas ipſa ſuccumberet, &amp; ideo perſeverare non poſſent, quia deficientes infirmitate nec vellent, aut non ita vellent infirmitate voluntatis ut poſſent.</hi> For if in ſo great infirmitie of this life, their will were left unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that in the helpe of God they might continue if they would, &amp; God ſhould not work in them that they would, amongſt ſo many and ſo great tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, this will it ſelfe would ſinke (under the burthen of them) and therefore could not perſevere, becauſe failing through infirmity they would not, or (at leaſt) they would not in ſuch a meaſure, through the wills infirmity, as to be able to ſtand. So that <hi>poſſe ſimpliciter</hi> ſtill with <hi>Auſtin</hi> includes the will, and is a denomination of the will, ariſing from the ſtrength of it prevailing above the fleſh, luſting to the contrary. In like ſort <hi>Honorius Auguſtodunenſis de praedeſt. &amp; lib. arbit:</hi> diverſe times aſcribes <hi>poſse</hi> to grace ſubſequent, like as he aſcribes <hi>velle</hi> to grace prevenient, as when he ſayth; <hi>Deus operatur in electis ſuis ſua gratia praeveniendo velle, &amp; ſubſeqendo poſſe.</hi> And againe, <hi>gratiam accipimus, cum nos Deus praevenit, ut velimus, &amp; ſubſequitus ut poſſimus.</hi> And againe <hi>Gratia Dei praevenit ut bonum quod ſprevit cupiat, &amp; ſequitur ut illud implere praevaleat.</hi> So that in effect this <hi>poſſe</hi> comes to be all one with <hi>agere</hi> or <hi>perficere quod volumus.</hi> For when we not only will that which is good, but ſo affectionately will it, as to prevaile over the fleſh luſting againſt it, all inward impediments being thus maſtered, the perfecting of that we will muſt needes follow. But as for that <hi>poſſe ſi velint,</hi> this goes before the willing of it And I ſee no reaſon to the contrary but that we may with <hi>Auſtin</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſuch a power common to all; which in the diſputations between <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Pelagius</hi> was called <hi>poſſibilitas agendi quod bonum est;</hi> and <hi>Auſtin</hi> was ſo farre from excepting againſt it as maintained by <hi>Pelagius,</hi> that more then once; he profeſſeth, that in caſe like as he acknowledged <hi>poſſe</hi> to be from God, ſo he would acknowledge <hi>velle</hi> and <hi>agere</hi> to be from God he ſhould be received for a good Catholique in this, by <hi>Auſtins</hi> judgment.

So that if they reſted here, to wit, in ſaying, that by univerſall grace all men may believe if they will, there is no grace acknowledged by them, tending to the furtherance of the good of mankind, but we acknowledge it as well as they, and make the extenſion of it as large as they. And therefore the more vaine and voyd of all reaſon is their pretence, that we for want of acknowledging ſuch an univerſality of grace as they doe, <hi>doe drowne men in carnall ſecurity, and countenance carnall liberty.</hi> Only though we grant the reality of that which they maintaine, yet we deny that it deſerves to be called grace, as touching the firſt prevenient grace as they call it, which we with <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſay deſerves to be called nature rather then grace, as we ſpeake of grace, to wit, as diſtinct from nature, and indeed ſupernaturall. And as for grace ſubſequent, that conſiſting only in concourſe, we deny that to be grace; for as much as Gods concourſe is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as well to any ſinfull act, as to any gracious act, as now adaies is commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged on all ſides. But as for the enlivening of all mens wills, <hi>and enabling them to will any ſpirituall good whereto they ſhall be excited</hi> (for this is their very forme of words) we utterly deny this, and are ready to demonſtrate the unreaſonableneſſe thereof. For firſt ſeeing this cannot be underſtood of life naturall but of life ſpirituall, it followeth that all men by this doctrine are regenerated; and as they confeſſe this diſpoſition continues in all unto death, ſo it followeth, that all and every one ſhould dye in the ſtate of regeneration alſo: Secondly, ſeeing there are but three ſorts of qualities in the ſoule of a reaſonable creature, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath obſerved, to wit, powers, paſſions, and habits; it followeth that this enlivening of the will muſt conſiſt,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56120:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
either in giving it new powers, or new paſſions, or new habits, which it had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But neither of theſe can be affirmed with any ſobriety, neither doe I find that they look to be called to any ſuch account, but in their aëriall contemplations of Gods attributes, eſpecially of his <hi>mercy and juſtice,</hi> ſhaped at pleaſure, doe conceive hand over head, that ſuch an enlivening there muſt be of the will of man in all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling themſelves to enquire wherein it conſiſts. But let us proceed in our triall of the ſoundneſſe of it, by the touch-ſtone of rationall and Chriſtian diſcourſe. Firſt therefore, I ſay it can be no new power infuſed into the will by this enlivening; For the will it ſelfe is a power; and it was never heard that <hi>potentia</hi> can be <hi>ſubjectum potentiae,</hi> a power can be the ſubject of a power; and that a power ſhould be in a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as an accident in the ſubject thereof. Rationall powers are but two, the power of underſtanding, and the power of willing, and both theſe are naturall, following <hi>ex principiis ſpeciei,</hi> from the very nature of the humane ſoule, as all confeſſe. But ſome may ſay, are there not ſupernaturall powers beſtowed on man as well as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall? I anſwer, theſe ſupernaturall powers, are but the elevating of the naturall powers unto ſupernaturall objects; as the underſtanding by enlightning it, and the will by ſanctifying it. Never was it ſaid, I preſume, that a man regenerate had two underſtandings in him, by the one to underſtand things naturall, and by the other to underſtand things ſpirituall; but that by the ſame underſtanding he underſtands both, but by light of nature the one, by light of grace the other. The holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>That they who are accuſtomed to doe evill, can no more doe good, then a Blackemore can change his skinne, and a Leopard his ſpots:</hi> Yet when men of evill become good, they get not new powers properly, but new diſpoſitions rather of their naturall powers, which we call habits, and may be called morall powers, but not of indifferency to doe good or evill, ſuch as the naturall power of the will is, but ſuch as whereby is wrought in the will, a good likeing of that which is good, an abhorring of that which is evill; ſo that indeed theſe morall powers doe not make the will able to will, but rather actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally willing of that which is good in generall, which generall willingneſſe is ſpecified according to objects preſent, and opportunities offered of doing good in one kind rather then another. Like as juſtice makes a man willing unto juſt actions, which willingneſſe is exerciſed this way or that way, according to emergent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Secondly, no new paſſions are given by this enlivening of the will; well our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions may be ordered aright, both touching their objects, and touching the ſeaſon, and touching the meaſure, &amp; touching the rule of them; and in reſpect of this gracious ordering of them, they may be called new; like as a man regenerate is called a new man, though as he hath the ſame members of his body, nor more nor leſſe, ſo he hath ſtill the ſame faculties and paſſions of the ſoule, no more nor no leſſe; but theſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are better ſeaſoned, theſe paſſions are better ordered, and in like ſort, theſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body, are better employed then they were before; before they were made <hi>weapons of unrighteouſneſſe unto ſinne,</hi> now they are made, <hi>weapons of righteouſneſſe unto God. Rom.</hi> 6. 13. Thirdly, let us enquire whether by this pretended enlivening of the will common to all men, there are any new habits engendred. For that is the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. And ſo we commonly ſay that in regeneration, beſides the receiving of the ſpirit of God to dwell in our hearts, which is a great miſtery, there are certaine habits whereby our naturall powers are elevated unto ſupernaturall objects, and thereby fitted to performe ſupernaturall acts; and theſe are but three, (and accordingly but three ſorts of ſupernatuall acts) and commonly accounted the three Theologicall vertues, <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> And all morall vertues, which for the ſubſtance of them, in reference to their acts whereby they are acquired, and which they doe bring forth, are found in naturall men, doe become Chriſtian graces, as they are ſanctified by theſe three, and as their actions doe proceed from theſe. By faith we apprehend things beyond the compaſſe of reaſon, by hope we wait for the enjoying of ſuch things, which neither eye hath ſeen, &amp;c. And by charity, we love God (whom yet we have not ſeene) even to the contempt of our ſelves. Now I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume they will not ſay that theſe <hi>habits of Faith, Hope, and Charity,</hi> are beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all and every one, by that fained univerſall grace of theirs. And what other ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits they doe or can deviſe, I have had as yet no experience, neither am I able to comprehend. And indeed faith doth not leave a man in indifferency to believe or no; nor hope to wait, or no; nor charity to love God, or no: but they doe all diſpoſe the heart of man to believe only, to wait upon God only, to love God only; they

being the curing of infidelity, and deſpaire, &amp; hatred of God, or rather the removing of them, yet but in part, as regeneration in this life is but in part, there being ſtill a fleſh in us luſting againſt the ſpirit. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. Thus we may maintaine, that albeit eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man hath power to believe if he will, and repent if he will, a will to believe and a will to repent being the greateſt worke in the work of grace, I meane the reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the will, and making it willing to that which is good, though it requires ſtrength alſo to maſter the luſting of the fleſh, whereby it growes ſimply and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely potent to doe every good thing, without any effectuall impediment from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, yet nevertheleſſe, till this renovation be wrought by the hand of God, we may well ſay there is an utter impotency morall to doe any thing that is good and pleaſing in the ſight of God, whereby <hi>they cannot believe, they cannot repent, they cannot be ſubject to the law of God,</hi> And if to Preach this doctrine be <hi>to breed ſloth, to drowne men in carnall ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to countenance carnall liberty;</hi> then our Saviour did breed ſloth &amp;c. when he told his hearers plainly, <hi>He that is of God heareth Gods words, ye therefore heare them not, becauſe ye are not of God, Ioh.</hi> 8. 47. As likewiſe when he Preached unto them in this maner. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which ſent me draw him. Ioh.</hi> 6. 44. And the Evangeliſt alſo in ſaying, <hi>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardned their hearts, that they ſhould not ſee with their eyes, nor underſtand with their hearts, and ſhould be converted, and I ſhould heale them. Ioh.</hi> 12. 40. And none more then <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he tells the people of Iſrael in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſaying, <hi>Ye have ſeen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt, unto Pharaoh and unto all his ſervants, and to all his land. The great temptations which thine eyes have ſeen, thoſe great miracles and wonders, yet the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to ſee, and eares to heare unto this day.</hi> Yet this Author confeſſeth that our Saviours hearers, and <hi>Moſes</hi> his hearers, <hi>many of them might be Godly men; but no thankes to this doctrine of theirs that they were ſo (the true and naturall genius whereof</hi> (to wit, of Chriſts doctrine and <hi>Moſes</hi> his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for it is apparent, that it is the ſame with ours in this particular we now ſpeake of) <hi>is to breed ſloth, to drowne men in carnall ſecurity, and to countenance carnall liberty) but to ſome thing elſe, either to Gods providence who will not ſuffer this Doctrine (for his own glory and the good of men) to have any great ſtroake in their lives; or to mens incogitancy, who think not of reducing it, ad praxim, or drawing concluſions out of it, but reſt in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſpeculation of it, as they doe of many others; or laſtly to ſome good practicall concluſions, which they meet with in Gods word, and apply to their lives (as they doe not the former deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) ſuch as theſe are. Be ye holy as I am holy: without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God: Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum admiſſi riſum teneatis amici?</hi> Yet I pray reſtraine that, and give your ſorrow courſe rather in beholding ſuch prophane aſperſions caſt upon the holy Doctrine of Chriſt, his Prophets and Apoſtles; as if thereby ſloth were bred, and men drowned in carnall ſecurity, and carnall liberty countenanced. We are of another mind, for Wiſedome is juſtified of her Children; we obſerve the wiſedome of God herein to prevent the greateſt illuſions of Satan; and ſuch Doctrines as ſtand in moſt oppoſition unto grace. The morality of Heathen men was admirable; yet were it farre greater, we conceive no greater oppoſition unto grace, then to look for juſtification by it. In the next place, we conceive there is no greater oppoſition unto grace, then for a man to arrogate unto himſelfe, ability to doe that which is pleaſing in the ſight of God. Our Saviour hath ſaid. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 4. that, <hi>As the branch cannot beare fruit of it ſelfe, except it abide in the Vine, ſo neither can wee except we abide in him.</hi> So that either all the World muſt be engrafted into Chriſt or elſe it is not poſſible they ſhould bring forth ſweet grapes. Yet theſe men will have all and every one, to have their wills en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened and enabled to will any ſpirituall good, whereby they ſhall be excited. Is this doctrine of theirs fit to humble them, and not rather to puffe them up with a conceit of their own ſufficiency? Is not our doctrine farre more fit to humble us, and to what other end tendeth that of <hi>Moſes, The Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive, eyes to ſee, and eares to heare unto this day,</hi> But to beat them out of the conceit of any ſufficiency in them, to profit either by Gods word, or by his works, ſo as to be drawn thereby to doe any thing that was pleaſing in the ſight of God; and can there be any true holineſſe where humility is wanting? Againe, they are only thankfull unto God for giving them power to believe, to repent, and for exciting them hereunto; and concurring with them to the act of faith and repentance, for they acknowledge no other grace but this; We are bound by our doctrine to be thankfull, not only for theſe operations, but alſo for <hi>cauſing us to walke in his ſtatutes, to keepe his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and doe them, for healing our wayes, our back-ſlidings, our Rebellions,</hi> they by their
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56120:134"/>
Doctrine, are bound to be thankfull unto God, for no other grace in the way of grace prevenient, then ſuch as he vouchſafeth to reprobates, and did vouchſafe to <hi>Cain,</hi> to <hi>Judas,</hi> and to the Divells themſelves; how is it that they are not ſtricken with feare, leaſt in this caſe their condition be no better, then the condition of reprobates though God in good time may provide better things for them, then their opinions, have any congruity unto, having courſe only to the obſcuring and defacing of Gods grace? We by our doctrine are bound to give God thanks for ruling us with a mighty hand, and making us to paſſe under the rod, and bringing us unto the bond of the <note place="margin">Ezek. 20. 37. Ezek. 37. Deut. 30. 6. Eph. 2. Phil. 2. 13.</note> Covenant; for taking away our ſtony heart, and giving us an heart of fleſh; for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing our hearts to love him with all our heart; for raiſing us out of the dead, when he found us dead in ſinne; for working in us both the will, and the deed of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good worke, not according to any thing in us, but according to his good pleaſure: And this is ſo farre from breeding ſloth in us, or to drowne us in carnall ſecurity in the Apoſtles judgement as that upon this very ground, as by a forceable inducement he exhorts us <hi>to worke out our Salvation with feare and trembling,</hi> manifeſtly implying, that when men are of another opinion, as namely to thinke that <hi>the will and deed of any good thing is their owne worke,</hi> or if they doe acknowledge it to be Gods work, yet if they doe not acknowledge it to be wrought by God, <hi>according to his good pleaſure,</hi> but according to ſome diſpoſition whereby they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe themſelves thereunto; that is the high-way to make them carnally ſecure, and how but by a carnall confidence that they have power to turne to God when they liſt, to believe and repent when they will, and withall that their wills are as plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to good as to evill, and ſo make it an eaſy mater at any time to turne to God. I appeale to the judgment of every ſober conſcience to judge betweene us which of our Doctrines moſt tends to the countenancing of carnall ſecurity, according to the Tenor of the Apoſtles exhortation in this place and that in coherence with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereby he doth enforce it, theirs, or ours. But to proceed, they acknowledge Chriſt to have merited for them only a power to believe and repent and meanes to excite them hereunto, and concourſe divine to the act of believing and repenting in caſe they will; we acknowledge not only all this, but over and above that Chriſt hath merited for us, the working of our wills effectually and predominantly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and that God makes us perfect to every good worke, working in us that which is pleaſing in his ſight through Jeſus Chriſt. Nay what will you ſay, if the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 21.</note> now a dayes openly profeſſe, that Chriſt merited not for any man faith and regeneration, and I commend them for their ingenuity, in dealing fairly and plainly confeſſing that which their opinion doth manifeſtly drive unto. Laſtly we confeſſe that God hath power as to <hi>ſhew mercy on whom he will, and harden whom he will,</hi> ſo to make whom he will a veſſell of mercy, and whom he will a veſſell of wrath, this we clearely profeſſe, namely, that God hath ſuch power even over our ſelves, and our childeren and all thoſe that are neere and deare unto us, as over any others: But this theſe adverſaries of ours now a days utterly deny; now I pray conſider whoſe doctrine ſavoreth of greater holineſſe in acknowledging the ſoveraignty of God over his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, theirs or ours? But it will not be labour loſt altogether to conſider thoſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes whereunto he is pleaſed to impute that Godlineſſe, which is found in us. The firſt is Gods providence; and indeed I find them liberall enough in acknowledging Gods providence in generall termes, and as forward to blaſt it when they come to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. Now as for that providence which is the cauſe of Godlineſſe, we like plaine fellowes comonly call it grace, and the ground of this Authors ſubtility in calling it providence and not grace, I comprehend not. But what is that operation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence divine or grace which is the cauſe of Godlineſſe? Is it any other in his opinion then that univerſall grace whereby they have power to be Godly and which grace God affords unto Reprobates, and that exciting grace whereby God perſwades them to be Godly, and his readineſſe to concurre to any act of Godlineſſe in caſe we will: and is not all this afforded (in his opinion) to Reprobates as well as to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, to them that have no Godlineſſe at all in them, as to them that have? And why may not this doctrine of ours whereby we maintaine, that <hi>God workes in us both the will and the deed according to his goodpleaſure,</hi> be a meanes to make us ſet our ſelves to the <hi>working out of our Salvation with feare and trembling,</hi> conſidering that the Apoſtle profeſſeth this doctrine of Gods energeticall operation of every good thing in us as a ſtrong induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to worke out our Salvation with feare and trembling; and wherein conſiſts
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56120:134"/>
any mans Godlineſſe if not in this, to wit, in working out his Salvation with feare and trembling? And is it not apparent that we maintaine this doctrine. namely, that God is he who workes in us both the will and the deed, and every good thing, and that according to his good pleaſure in farre more undoubted manner then they doe. And how can it appeare that they doe acknowledge this? To give us power to will that which i good (which is the effect of that univerſall grace they talke of) is this to worke in us either the will or the deed? To excite us by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion and exhortation to will &amp; doe that which is good, to believe and to repent, is to worke either in us the will or deed of that which is good, of faith of repentance? Laſtly to be ready to concurre with us to the will or deed of faith and repentance if ſo be we will concurre with him to the ſame, or to concurre with us to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the act of willing &amp; the act of doing that which is good, in caſe we produce the ſame act of willing and doing that which is good, is this to worke in us both the will and the deed? Conſider I pray is it not true that God is as ready to concurre with us to any ſinfull act, in caſe we will concurre with him; and doth he not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with man to the produceing of any ſinfull act, in caſe man at that time doth produce it; And will any ſober man ſay that this is alſo for God to worke in him both the will and the deed of every ſinfull act? And why might we not ſay ſo, if God workes it only by concourſe? Laſtly to worke in us both the will and the deed provided that man will concurre to the working hereof not otherwiſe, is this to worke it according to his good pleaſure, and not rather according to mans good pleaſure? And how I pray, or in what ſence doth he ſay that God by his providence will not ſuffer this doctrine to have any ſtroke in our lives? For if he ſuffers it not, then he hinders it; let it therefore be made appeare how he hinders it; To concurre with us, if we will concurre with him in the producing of any act of Godlineſſe, is this to hinder our carnall ſecurity? If ſo then to concurre with us to the producing of any ſinfull act is to hinder our Godlineſſe. Surely to give power whereby men are enabled to doe any ſpirituall good if they will is not to hinder carnall ſecurity, for ſuch a power is given to all by univerſall grace, yet this doth nothing hinder the carnall ſecurity of many thouſands. Or doth he hinder it by exciting us to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? Yet if this doctrine (as we conceive) be apt to drowne us in carnall ſecurity, how can he be ſayd to hinder us from it? For either the doctrine muſt yeeld to ſuch excitations &amp; exhortations from carnall ſecurity; or ſuch exhortations muſt yeeld to the doctrine, eſpecially conſidering what <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayth, that if there be any difference betweene <hi>docere</hi> and <hi>ſuadere</hi> or <hi>exhortari;</hi> yet even this <hi>doctrinae generalitate comprehenditur.</hi> And for incogitancy, which is a ſecond device, pretended as the cauſe why this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine doth not expoſe us to carnality, is it not incredible, theſe poynts being ſo much ventilated by them as none more? The Church of God having been exerciſed with none more (as I think) theſe hundred yeares; that men ſhould not think of, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of thoſe dangerous conſequences in manners, as theſe doe forge in their own braines. And as for the laſt, imputing our Godlineſſe to ſome good practicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions; may I not juſtly ſay, that if ever any man wrote with the ſpirit of giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, this Author deſerves to have a chiefe place amongſt them: For compare his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the ſecond objection with this; There he ſaith ſuch diſſolute concluſions as theſe following, doe ariſe out of this doctrine of ours: <hi>If I be choſen, I muſt of neceſſity believe and be ſaved; If I be caſt off, I muſt as neceſſarily not believe and be damned; what need I therefore take thought either way about meanes or end.</hi> Now will it not as well follow, <hi>what need I therefore take thought of holineſſe, of obedience?</hi> For even theſe are as good practicall concluſions. <hi>Believe and thou ſhalt be ſaved. Repent and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> As theſe, <hi>Be ye holy as I am holy. Without holineſse no man ſhall ſee God. If ye conſent and obey, ye ſhall eate the good things of the Land.</hi> And by the way obſerve I pray, with what judgement he calls them practicall concluſions; whereas all ſave two of them, are exhortations rather then concluſions; And thoſe two; to wit, <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God,</hi> and, <hi>Godlineſſe hath the promiſes, both of this life &amp;c.</hi> I ſhould take them to be principles rather then concluſions. Whether ſimple men doe <hi>apply their braines to ponder and conſider this doctrine or no,</hi> I know not; but certainly the learned and Godly maintainers of it, have had cauſe enough to ponder it, and conſider it throughly, and have given evidence enough of their thorough conſideration of it; yet have they fetcht no ſuch ſequells out of it. If ſimple men doe, and our adversaries be of the number of them, and content themſelves with ſuch ſimplicity; yet is it not
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:56120:135"/>
enough for us that the Apoſtle doth not? the holy Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul?</hi> but expreſſely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth the contrary there from; namely; <hi>that becauſe of God worketh in us the will and the deed according to his good pleaſure, therefore it becomes us to worke out our Salvation with feare and trembling?</hi> Now which of us doe moſt exactly concurre with the Apoſtle in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>that God doth worke in us both the will and the deed according to his good pleaſure,</hi> I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well content, that all the World both wiſe and ſimple, both Learned and unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned may judge.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. As touching the ſecond; Firſt let us conſider how the objection is ſhaped. Secondly, as it lies, with what judgement and ſobriety it is impugned.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. It is true men are abſolutely elected or abſolutely rejected; but we content not our ſelves with generalities, wherein as <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath obſerved, doe lurke many equivocations: Neither doe we delight in confounding things that differ. Election and rejection or reprobation, and in generall the will of God, may be conſidered, either <hi>Quoad actum voluntis,</hi> as touching the act of God willing, or as touching the things willed. Of this diſtinction this Author takes no notice; It is fit for ſome and advantagious to fiſh in troubled waters. Now as touching the act of God willing; both <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath proved, that there can be no cauſe thereof; and withall profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that never was any ſo mad as to ſay <hi>That merites can be the cauſe of predestination, quoad actum praedeſtinantis,</hi> as touching the act of God predeſtinating. And <hi>Bradwardine</hi> hath curiouſly diſputed this way that no will of God is conditionall, to will <hi>quoad actum volentis,</hi> And <hi>Piſcator</hi> againſt <hi>Vorſtius</hi> hath proved the ſame after his way; and by variety of demonſtration this way may be convinced, as in part I have ſhewed in this diſcourſe, both on the part of election, and on the part of reprobation. And both D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                                 <hi>Jackson</hi> in his booke of <hi>Providence,</hi> profeſſeth that the diſtinction of <hi>Voluntas ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedens</hi> and <hi>conſequens,</hi> or antecedent and conſequent will in God is to be underſtood <hi>quoad res volitas</hi> as touching the things willed, as much as to ſay, <hi>non quoad actum volentis.</hi> And <hi>Gerardus Voſſius</hi> drawing the diſtinction of will antecedent and will conſequent unto the diſtinction of will abſolute and will conditionall, applyes it only <hi>quoad res</hi>

And this is more apparent by the reading of <hi>Voſſius</hi> himſelfe. Hiſtor: Pelag: l: 7. treating of Gods will to ſave all. Now if we ſpeake thus of Gods will <hi>quoad res volitas</hi> as touching the <hi>things willed;</hi> theſe things willed being very different, wee have reaſon to conſider them diſtinctly alſo.

                                 <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Salvation, And as touching grace, to wit, the grace of regeneration, the grace of faith and repentannee, we willingly confeſſe that Gods will to conferre them is ſo abſolute, that he hath determined to conferre them according to the meere pleaſure of his will, not according to mans workes (which is plaine Pelagianiſme and condemned in the Synod of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> above 1200 yeares agoe) and as he gives them to whom he will, ſo he denyes them to whom he will according to that <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth.</hi> But as touching Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or damnation in which reſpect this Author uſually ſpeakes of the abſolute or conditionall will of God; we uttererly deny, that God in the diſpenſation or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, or execution of theſe proceeds or ever did decree to proceed according to the meere pleaſure of his owne will, but altogether according to theire workes. For albeit God hath made no law according whereto he meanes to proceed in giving or denying grace, yet hath he made a law according whereto he proceeds in beſtowing Salvation, and inflicting damnation. And the law is this: <hi>Whoſever believeth ſhall be Saved, Whoſoever believeth not ſhall bedamned</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>We must all appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgement Seate of Chriſt, that every man may receive the things, which are done in his body according to that he hath done, whether good or evill.</hi> So that according to that ſence wherein this Author uſually ſpeakes of the abſolute and conditionall will of God, we utterly deny that God doth abſolutely elect any man to Salvation, or reject any man unto damnation; though he doth abſolutely elect ſome unto grace, that is to the grace of regeneration; to the grace of faith and repentance, and abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject others there from. For as much as he beſtowes theſe graces on ſome and denies them unto others not according to their workes, but according to the meere plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:56120:135"/>
of his owne will, but he doth not inflict damnaton or beſtow Salvation according to the meere pleaſure of his will, but according unto mans works. And as he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth himſelfe in the execution of Salvation and damnation, after the ſame manner he did from everlaſting decree to carry himſelfe, namely to Save no man of ripe yeares but by way of reward of their faith, repentance, and good workes; ſo to damne none but for their infidelity, impenitency and evill works. As for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Gods will of election and reprobation unto any, we ſay, that ordinarily, man may be aſſured of his election. For the ſpirit of God is given to this very end <hi>even to ſhed the love of God in our hearts,</hi> that is, Gods love towards us. <hi>Rom:</hi> 5. 5. And what is the ſhedding therefore in our hearts, but his working in us a ſenſe and feeling thereof, eſpecially conſidering that the ſence of Gods love to us is the cauſe of our love to wards God; according to that 1 <hi>John.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>We love him becauſe he loved us firſt:</hi> and accordingly <hi>the ſpirit</hi> is ſayd <hi>to testifie unto our ſpirits that we are the ſonnes Rom.</hi> 8. And <hi>if ſonnes then heyres, even heyres of God, and heyres annexed with Chriſt.</hi> And the Apoſtle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                                 <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts us <hi>to give diligence te make our election &amp; vocation ſure;</hi> implying ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.</note> that men may be ſure of their election; otherwiſe why ſhould our Saviour wiſh his Diſciples to rejoyce not in this <hi>that Divells were ſubdued unto them, but that their names were writen in Heaven.</hi> And by what meanes may a man be aſſured hereof, but either <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 20.</note> immediatly by the teſtimony of the ſpirit, or mediatly by the fruits of the ſpirit as the fruits of our election; one where of is faith plainly ſo ſignified <hi>Act,</hi> 13. 48. <hi>As many believed as were ordained to everlaſting Life.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 2. laſt. <hi>God added daily to the Church ſuch as ſhould be Saved;</hi> And repentance is another: <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 18. <hi>Then hath God unto the Gentiles alſo given repentance unto life.</hi> Giving to underſtand that as many as to whom God giveth repentance, he hath ordained them unto life. And indeed by the worke of our faith, and labour of our love, and the patience of our hope, others come to be aſſured of our election (how much more our ſelves, no man knowing the things of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo as the ſpirit of man 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2.) Thus S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                                 <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth his aſſurance of the election of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 3, 4. <hi>We remember the worke of your faith, and the labour of your love &amp;c. Knowing beloved bretheren that ye are elect of God.</hi> And hereupon he proceeds to aſſure them, that Antichriſt <hi>by all his deceiveableneſse of unrighteouſneſſe ſhall never prevaile over them;</hi> in as much as he prevailes only over them that periſh 2 <hi>Theſs:</hi> 2. 10.

And ſurely if certainty of ſalvation were a meanes of licentiouſneſſe, the Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter</hi> would never have exhorted us, <hi>to give diligence to make our calling and election ſure.</hi> And we manifeſtly ſeem to perceive ſtrength <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10.</note> of encouragement hereby unto Godlineſſe; as being aſſured that Chriſt dyed for us, to the end we might live unto him.

Laſtly conſidering how farre Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtanity is ſpred and the abominable Idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we whom God hath delivered out of <hi>Babylon</hi> have no cauſe (I meane any particular perſon) to project, that becauſe the elect are but few, therefore we are not of the number of them, and thereupon give over all care of hearkening to Gods word, which is the power of God unto Salvation and may ſhew its power upon us alſo we knowe not how ſoone, but rather as our Saviour anſwered (being demanded of his diſciples whether there were but few that ſhould be ſaved) ſaying ſtrive <hi>[you] to enter in at the ſtreight gate,</hi> plainly giving to underſtand, that as the gate is ſaid to be ſtreight that leadeth unto Life, ſo there be but few that enter thereat &amp; therefore they ſhould ſtrive ſo much the more to be of the number of thoſe few. For what if along time we have little or nothing profited, what if we have cauſe to doubt whether we have any true faith or no; ſuch doubts maybe better ſignes then we are awar of; otherwiſe why ſhould the Apoſtle exhort the Corinthians <hi>to examine themſelves and prove whether they were in the faith or no?</hi> But however it fairs with us doth not the Apoſtle plainely teach us, that God calls ſome at the firſt houre of the day, ſome at the the third, ſome at <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 5.</note> the laſt?</p>
                              <p n="2">2. Now I come to the conſideration of his anſwer to the objection, as himſelf hath formed it. And firſt I obſerve, that whereas he pretends to build his anſwer upon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the number of Reprobats without compariſon greater then the number of the elect, yet the abſurd reaſoning which he brings hereupon, doth nothing at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on that. For albeit the number of the elect, were greater then the number of ſuch as are Reprobats, and that without compariſon; yet the reaſoning here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the contrary propoſition hath equally place, as in the contrary caſe, As namely, to reaſon thus: <hi>Either I am abſolutely choſen to grace and glory or abſolutely caſt off from both.</hi> Secondly the joyning of grace and glory together, as this Author doth joyne them in this reaſoning ſhaped by him is a miſerable confounding of things that differ. For to be abſolutely choſen unto grace is to be ordained to have grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him not according to any worke of his, but meerely according to the good pleaſure of Gods will, anſwerably to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>God hath mercy on whom he will,</hi> but no man is ſo choſen unto glory, as namely to be ordained to have Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beſtowed upon him not according unto workes, but according to the meere pleaſure of God, if we ſpeake of men of ripe yeares. For God hath ordained to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow Salvation on ſuch only by way of reward of their faith, repentance, and good workes. So on the other ſide to be aſolutely caſt off from grace, is to be ordained to have grace denied him; not according to any worke of his, but meerely according to the good pleaſure of Gods will, like as <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth, that <hi>the Lord hardeneth whom he will,</hi> But no man is ſo caſtaway from Glory, or unto damnation, as namely, to be ordained to be deprived of Glory and to be damned, meerely for the good pleaſure of God, but altogether for his infidelity, impenitency and evill workes. Thirdly, no ſuch thing followes as here is inferred from the ſuppoſition of election unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For ſeing no man is elected to obtaine Salvation, whether he believe or no, but only in caſe he believe, hereupon men are rather excited to labour for faith, then to be careleſſe thereof; and farther we ſay, that as God hath ordained to bring them to Salvation, ſo he hath ordained to bring them hereunto by ſanctification and faith. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13. And the word of God is a powerfull meanes to worke them hereunto, even to the working out of their Salvation with feare and trembling, &amp; that becauſe they are given to underſtand <hi>that God is he who wroketh in them both the will</hi>

                                 <hi>and the deed according to his good pleaſure.</hi> On the other ſide if a man be ordained to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet ſeeing no man is ordained to be damned but for deſpiſing the means of grace in caſe he heare the Goſpel; &amp; for ought any man knowes he may as well be ordained to ſalvation as to damnation; this I ſhould think, is rather an excitement not to deſpiſe or neglect the meanes of grace, then to deſpiſe or neglect them. Suppoſe God ſhould
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:56120:136"/>
not damne any man, but annihilate them, and ſuppoſe this were known unto us; by the ſame argumentation it would follow, that a man ſhould have no care of good workes: But this conſequent is notoriouſly untrue. For ſeeing the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my reaſonable nature, whereby I differ from brute Beaſts, conſiſteth in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and morall vertues; and there is no knowledge that doth more ennoble us, then the knowledge of God, and no better rule of morality, then the law of God; ſurely it ſtood me upon in reaſon, to ſtrive according to my power to know God, and to be obedient rather then otherwiſe; although I know for certaine, that after certaine yeares, both body and ſoule ſhould be returned unto nothing. Come wee now to the conſideration of this reaſoning, in reſpect of grace. Suppoſe God hath elected me unto grace; yet ſeeing he beſtowes not grace but by his word, therefore there is no reaſon I ſhould neglect the uſe of his word, but rather good reaſon why I ſhould embrace it, and that with all earneſtneſſe. Like as in caſe God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned I ſhall have Children, doth it hence follow that I neede not uſe the company of a Woman; becauſe ſeeing God hath decreed I ſhall have Children, therefore I may be ſure to have them, whether I company with a Woman or no, belike right as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons come by Chicken? On the other ſide, ſuppoſe God hath not ordained me unto grace; yet hence it followeth not, that I ſhould neglect all care of morall vertue, yea or the uſe of Gods word. Firſt not of morall vertue; for next unto grace, morall vertue commends a man, and like as many heathens were famous for morality, without any ſanctifying grace; ſo may I be in the ſame kind of reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo. And ſeeing no better rules of morality are to be found, then in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, therefore may I well be moved to give my ſelfe to the ſtudy thereof. And <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> telleth us, that ſome, even of reprobates, by the word of God may <hi>Proficere ad exteriorem vitae emendationem, quò mitius puniantur.</hi> Laſt of all, conſider how the like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections were made againſt that deſtiny, which was maintained by the Stoicks. <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neades</hi> was a great oppugner of the Stoicks, yet was aſhamed of ſuch a kind of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation as this Author affecteth.

                           <p n="1">1. That he was of <hi>Calvins</hi> and S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> opinion, that men are not dealt withall, <hi>ſecundum bona,</hi> or <hi>mala opera,</hi> according to their works good or evill, but that there are <hi>occultiores cauſae</hi> more hidden cauſes of mens eternall condition.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That he was one of that woefull company of abſolute caſtawaies, <hi>Vas formatum in ignominiam,</hi> a veſſell prepared to diſhonour: and that therefore (though his life had been none of the worſt) he could not poſſibly be ſaved.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. That being unable to beare the dreadfull apprehenſions of wrath, with which he was affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he hanged himſelfe. For theſe are ſome of his laſt words there recorded, <hi>Diſcedo igitur ad Lacus Infernales aeternum dedecus patriae meae, Deo vos commendo, cujus miſericordia mihi negata eſt.</hi> I goe to thoſe infernall lakes, a perpetuall reproach to my Country, commending you to God whoſe mercy is deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mee.</p>
                           <p>Out of this example we may eaſily collect two things.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That men who think that there are many, whom God hath utterly rejected out of his only will and pleaſure, may be eaſily brought to think by Satans ſuggeſtion, that they are of that company: And</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That this temptation is very dangerous; I conclude therefore the firſt part of my laſt Reaſon, that abſolute Reprobation leads men into temptation.</p>

                              <p>AS I remember, when this Author firſt had reſort unto ſome prime ſtickler for the Arminian way to conferre with him there about, it was told me that this Authour ſhould alledge, that our doctrine of election was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable doctrine: but then on the other ſide, it was alledged, that granting that, yet with all it did expoſe to deſſolutenes of life.

                              <p>Now I come to the particular accommodation of this argument againſt our doctrine. And of this he ſayth, that <hi>It leads men into temptation, and into ſuch a one as is as ſharpe and dangerous as any the tempter hath.</hi> Now the temptation here ſpoken of conſiſts in this, that <hi>The Divell can eaſily perſwade a man that makes abſolute reprobation a part of his Creed, that he is one of thoſe abſolute reprobates becauſe thoſe are more abſolute reprobates (even an hundred for one) then abſolute choſen ons,</hi> and a man hath a greatdeale more reaſon to thinke that he is one of the moſt then one of the leaſt, one of the huge multitude of inevitable caſtawayes, then on of that little flock, for whom God hath abſolutely prepared a Kingdome. And this he pretends to prove out of <hi>Calvin, Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Zanchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi>
                                 <pb n="257" facs="tcp:56120:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and this togither with a ſtory related out of <hi>Georgius</hi> Major a Lutheran concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Petrus Gloſuanus,</hi> a Schoole-maſter in Hungary is all his proofe. Now in anſwer hereunto I will proceed by degrees. Firſt he continueth ſtill to ſerve his turne with the equivocation of this phraiſe of <hi>abſolute reprobation</hi> without diſtinguiſhing: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, it may be gathered by his diſcourſe, that as Others doe, ſo he himſelfe conſiders it not <hi>quoad actum volentis, as touching the act of God willing,</hi> but <hi>quoad res volitas, as touching the things willed.</hi> Yet he is well pleaſed to confound the things willed into one, as if they had no difference as touching their abſoluteneſſe, whereas the deniall of grace together with the inflicting of damnation, (which are the things willed by reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which accordingly is diſtinguiſhed <hi>into Roprobation from grace, &amp; reprobation from glory,</hi> or unto damnation) are ſo different, that God doth decree indeed the abſoluteneſſe of the one, but he doth not at all decree the abſoluteneſſe of the other, but meerly the conditionall nature thereof. For grace he denieth and purpoſeth to deny abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For the Apoſtle plainly profeſſeth, That as <hi>God hath mercy on whom he will Rom:</hi> 9. 18. By bringing them unto faith. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 30. <hi>So he hardeneth whom he will by denying faith unto them.</hi> But as for Glory and damnation, like as God doth not abſolutely, ſo neither did he decree abſolutely to deny the one &amp; inflict the other, but only conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, to wit, in caſe of finall perſeverance in ſin. Therefore I have reaſon to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him of reprobation from grace, as often as he ſpeaks of abſolute reprobation, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently his meaning muſt be that God doth not deny grace, but upon condition of mans doing or not doing ſome thing, ſo that if either man did ſomething or leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſome thing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God would give him grace, which for want thereof he doth not; which is as good, as in plain termes to profeſſe, <hi>That grace is given according to works.</hi> Then againe conſider, what is that grace, which is given upon condition, and not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely by theſe mens opinion; Is it which thy call univerſall, and wherein conſiſts the enlivening of mans will, &amp; the enabling of him <hi>to will any ſpirituall good whereto, he ſhall be excited?</hi> This cannot be given any otherwiſe then abſolutely; for as much as they make it to be given when a man commeth into the world: and to that purpoſe doe alleadge that, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. <hi>This is that true light which enlightens every man that commeth into the world.</hi> Or Is it exciting grace, that is not given abſolutely? This cannot be neither; For this exciting grace is in the miniſtry of the Word. Now when the Goſpell is brought unto a Nation, not only the civill ſort; but the moſt prophane are made partakers of it indifferently; ſo that predeſtination hereunto muſt be acknowledged even by the Arminians themſeves to be abſolute, as it ſignifies predeſtination unto grace preve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. So that if any predeſtination unto grace, be not abſolute but conditionall, it muſt needs be predeſtination unto grace ſubſequent. As for example, God doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to worke in man the act of willing that which is good; this decree (ſay they) is not abſolute but conditionall. Now I pray conſider what is, or can be the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereof, but the act of willing? And this indeed is their doctrine, as I have ſeen it under the hand of one of them, namely, that God doth work in us <gap reason="foreign">

                                 <hi>velle modo velimus,</hi> as much as to ſay, If we will make our ſelves willing to believe, to repent, to doe any good work, then God will make us willing hereunto. This is the iſſue of the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table doctrine of theſe <hi>Arminians;</hi> and unleſſe we concurre with them in ſuch unſober expreſſions, we expoſe our ſelves to the temptations of Satan (yea the foreſt temptations if we believe this Author;) and bereave our ſoules of all comfort from the Scriptures; As if divine conſolations were like to their argumentations, the one as unſober as the other. But let us conſider the force of his Argument; If it be ſo eaſy a matter for the Divell to perſwade a man of this, how came it to paſſe that he did not perſwade <hi>Auſtin</hi> hereof, or <hi>Proſper,</hi> or <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> or any of thoſe ancient writers, in this argument againſt the Pelagians: How is it that he could not performe ſo eaſy a matter upon <hi>Calvin, Bucer, Beza, Zanchy, Junius, Piſcator,</hi> or any other of thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous writers in this argument? How is it that he prevailes over ſo few in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Nay, conſider was there ever any that was perſwaded, or can this Author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any evidence to prove, that ever any was perſwaded that himſelfe was a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate upon this ground, to wit, becauſe the number of Reprobates are by farre few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the number of Gods elect. though (as he ſpeakes) an hundred for one? I have read of diverſe, collected by <hi>Goulartius</hi> within that century of yeares next preceding his worke, that have caſt themſelves away in deſpaire; yet not all neither upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their abſolute reprobation: And of them that have ſo conceived, not one doe I find that hath entertained this conceit upon the ground here mentioned by this
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56120:139"/>
Authour <hi>Francis Spira</hi> is a ſtrange preſident, but the ground of this deſperate conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is manifeſted to have bin this, that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceived himſelf to have ſined the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. Many in our dayes have been knowne to have made themſelues a way, and this very yeare 1632, hath brought forth many ſtrange examples in this kind; but hitherto I have not heard that the ground of this their deſperate reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was this, that the Devill had perſwaded them they were abſolute Reprobates, much leſſe that they were perſwaded hereunto by ſo ſorry a ground, as that which this Authour alledgeth. And as before I ſignified, all this muſt proceed of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from grace; And if God deny grace upon the meere pleaſure of his will, and not according to mens workes, the way is open to deſperation, and it is an eaſy matter for the Devill to perſwade us that we are abſolute Reprobates; as this Authour with great zeale of his cauſe, belike upon the ſingular comfort he finds in his owne way, diſputeth. But over whom hath the Divell this power? Not over Heathens, for they are nothing acquainted with the doctrine of election, and reprobation; but over Chriſtians; Yet conſider I pray, who are Chriſtians, but ſuch as believe in Chriſt? And is it an eaſy matter for the Devill to perſwade ſuch as believe in Chriſt that they are Reprobates? If ſo then either as it is reprobation from grace, or as it ſignifies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation from glory, not as it ſignifies reprobation from grace; for it is ſuppoſed they are in the ſtate of grace, to wit, in the ſtate of faith, which is the prime grace. As for reprobation from glory, we doe not maintaine that God doth abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that, or that he decreed abſolutely to deny that, but only to ſuch as ſhould be found to dye in ſinne. Againe, as many as maintaine abſolute reprobation, they doe withall maintain that faith is a fruit of election and conſequently by the Genius of their doctrine muſt conclude that they are elect and not Reprobates. Againe, they according to their doctrine doe maintaine, that who is once in the ſtate of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion connot fall a way totally or finally: Therefore they are not ſo eaſy to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that they are Reprobates at all, but elect rather. Let <hi>them,</hi> that is our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, looke to this, and that they are not eaſily perſwaded by the Devill that they are reprobates, at leaſt, that they neither have or can have any aſſurance of their election, for as much as they deny faith to be a fruit of election; and whatſoever their faith be, yet are of opinion that they may totally and finally fall from it, and be damned. Farther conſider, ſeeing this Authour denies not, but the damnation of every Reprobate is decreed by God everlaſtingly, and that irrevocably, though upon foreſight of finall perſeverance in ſinne. I pray what comfort is it for any man that he is not an abſolute Reprobate, if ſo be he is perſwaded that he is a Reprobate, and from everlaſting ordained to condemnation? Now I will prove that it is an eaſy matter for the Devill to perſwade any Arminian that he is a Reprobate, by the ſame argument which this Authour uſeth againſt us. For ſeeing the Reprobates are more by farre then the elect, even an hundered for one, and withall that it is an eaſy thing for the Devill to perſwade any man that he is rather of that number which is greateſt then of that which is leaſt, hence it followes by his owne forme of argumentation that it is an eaſy matter for the Devill to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade any Arminian that he is a Reprobate. Yet the vanity of this argumentation I have formerly ſhewed by repreſenting firſt the vaſt number of Heathens in all ages in compariſon unto Chriſtians. Secondly the variety of Sects in Chriſtian Religion, and that moſt of them miſerably corrupt, together with the vaſt number of prophane perſons on the on ſide, and of Hypocrites on the other, why ſhould any man that is privy to his owne heart, as looking towards Heaven, be carried away with ſo baſe a pretence, as to conceive himſelfe to be a Reprobate, eſpecially conſidering the nature of man to hope the beſt of his fortunes, and that upon no ground to ſpeake of, as it appeares in thoſe who venture in Lotteries. Whereas every true Chriſtian believing in the Chriſt hath a certaine ground for the aſſurance of his election by our doctrine. And truly I am verily perſwaded the Devill is more wiſe then to think ſo baſe an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as this, is likely to prevaile; Save that in caſe this Author or his Informator doe believe as they pretend, hereupon he may take advantage to work upon them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own rules to perſwade them thereby, that they are Reprobates: and 'till we find he hath prevailed ſo with them, we have no reaſon to conceive that it is an eaſy matter for him to perſwade us that we are abſolute Reprobates; no nor then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſidering that we make no ſuch rules, but rather conceive them to be the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of crackt or crazed braines. And the Devill had need be more wiſe then ſo, if he
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:56120:139"/>
practice to prevaile with us, which undoubtedly, ſo long as God be pleaſed by his grace to keepe us in our right wits, he never ſhall: Certainly if they deſire to bring this rule into our faith, they muſt firſt manifeſt that the Devill hath ſo prevailed with them to make them conceive themſelues to be Reprobates; otherwiſe it cannot be they ſhould conceive ſo eaſy a matter for the Devill to perſwade any of us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo ſorry a ground as this, that we are abſolute Reprobates. As for them that are fallen, (to proſecute that diſtinction this Authour gives according to the parts of it, which the Authour himſelfe doth not) Chriſtians fallen may be underſtood two manner of wayes, either as fallen from the ſtate of grace, or as fallen only into ſinne, but ſtill ſtanding in the ſtate of grace. As touching the firſt we acknowledge no ſuch falling away, St <hi>John</hi> profeſſing of certaine Apoſtates ſaying, <hi>They went</hi> 
                                 <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 19.</note> 
                                 <hi>out from us, but they were not of us; for had they beene of us, they had continued with us.</hi> As for ſuch as fall into ſinne, we that maintaine abſolute election and reprobation, doe withall maintaine with King <hi>James</hi> in the conference at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> that all ſuch ſhall ariſe againe by repentance. And therfore there is no reaſon we ſhould conceive, upon the committing of any ſuch ſinne, that we are Reprobates; leaſt of all upon ſo baſe grounds as here are ſpecified by this Authour. Now I come to his proofe of this by his three teſtimonies.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. The firſt whereof is the teſtimony of <hi>Calvin:</hi> whereto I anſwer firſt in generall, That not one of theſe Authours here mentioned take any notice of the ground whereupon this Authour builds, namely, of the paucity of the elect in compariſon to Reprobates, therehence to conclude, That it is an eaſy matter for the Devill to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them that they are Reprobates, if they ſhould have beene ſure to have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo much from the pen of this Authour. More particularly I acknowledge the words of <hi>Calvin</hi> here alledged, namely, <hi>that the Devill doth not aſſault the believer with a temptation more dangerous:</hi> But why doth not this Authour goe on to tell, what the temptation is which as it were in a breath <hi>Calvin</hi> ſets downe thus, <hi>Quam dum ipſos ſuae electionis dubitatione inquietans, ſimul prava ejus extra viam inquirendae cupitate ſolicitat.</hi> It conſiſts of two parts. The firſt is <hi>diſquieting of them with doubting of their election.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, his ſolliciting of them with an <hi>ill deſire of inquiring about it, after a wrong way.</hi> Both theſe <hi>Calvin</hi> ſo compounds, as to make up but one tentation: In the next place, <hi>Calvin</hi> ſhewes what it is for a man to inquire of his election a wrong way. <hi>Extra viam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirere voco, ubi in abditos divinae ſapientiae receſſus perrumpere homuncio conatur, &amp; quo intelligat quid de ſe ſit conſtitutum apud Dei tribunal, ad ſupremam us<expan>

                                       <ex>que</ex>
                                    </expan> aeternitatem penetrare.</hi> To inquire after it out of the way, is, when a vile man endeavoureth to breake into the ſecrets of divine wiſdome, and to pierce into the higheſt eternity, to know what God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of him there. This he ſayeth is for <hi>a man to cast himſelfe into a deep, to be ſwallowed up of a bottomleſſe gulfe, and to throw himſelfe into innumerable ſnares, ſuch as he can never wind himſelfe out off.</hi> And to this he ſayeth we are very prone; and hereupon comes in the next ſentence alledged by this Authour, <hi>Rariſſimus enim eſt few there be whoſe minds are not taken up with this contemplation,</hi> Whence doth Salvation come unto thee, but from Gods election? Now what revelation haſt thou of thine election? And if theſe thoughts doe once take hold of a man, either in cruell manner it torments miſerable man continually, or makes him altogether ſtand aſtoniſhed. All this is delivered by <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> of them who enquire about their election a wrong way; the very ſame way being condemned alſo by King <hi>James</hi> in the conference at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> or that which he there delivereth much at one. And all this, this Authour very judiciouſly conceales, thinking ſuch a dog-trick well becomes his free will, and his grace alſo. But then <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> diſcovereth alſo another way, <hi>in ea luſtranda,</hi> that is, in diſcovering a mans election; and ſuch as wherein, <hi>tuta eſt pacata, addo etiam jucunda, navigatio a man may ſaile ſafely, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and ſweetly:</hi> and that they who ſearch after their election in a due order, <hi>as it is contained in Gods Word, they are like to reape thence ſingular conſolation, eximium inde referent conſolationis fructtum.</hi> Then he ſhewes what this way is, and that we muſt beginne from our vocation (to wit, unto faith and unto repentance) and thence aſcend to our election, in this way he profeſſeth no uncomfortable condition, but moſt comfortable is likely to accrue unto him. The wrong way he warnes us to avoyd carefully: but withall profeſſeth, that no rocke at all is likely to be met withall in this right way.

by this Authour himſelfe appeares to tend to no other end but this, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould not diſquiet themſelues with doubting, whether they are predeſtinate or no, but rather without doubt perſwade themſelues that they are of the number of thoſe whom God hath predeſtinate. And by this I perceive what is his meaning here in, which formerly I underſtood not, when this of <hi>Bucer</hi> was alleadged by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour to an other purpoſe. And his meaning ſeemes to be this, whoſoever is called and believes in Chriſt, ought to believe that he is predeſtinate. For indeed faith in his opinion is the fruit of our election, and from the like in the <hi>Theſſal: Paul</hi> was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of their election 1 <hi>Theſſ:</hi> 1. 3, 4. <hi>Remembring the worke of your faith and labour of your love, knowing that you are elected of God.</hi> Now ſhall others hereby be drawne to be confident of our election, and ſhall not we our ſelves who alone are privy to the ſecret paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our hearts, when others are not. Now I pray conſider, whether this be ſo much as to intimate that it is a farre eaſier matter for a man to be perſwaded that he is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, then that he is of the number of Gods elect.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. By this I perceive the meaning of <hi>Zanchy</hi> alſo, in ſaying, That every Chriſtian is bound to believe that he is elect: Let us in the name of God examine our faith whether it be true faith or no; but ſurely ſo farre as we are perſwaded of the truth of our faith, ſo farre have we no cauſe to doubt of our election. But this of <hi>Zanchius</hi> is no more to the purpoſe, whereunto this Authour alleadgeth it, than that of <hi>Bucers.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="4">4. In the laſt place, I come to the relation of <hi>Georgius Major</hi> of a certaine Schoole-Maſter in <hi>Hungary, Petrus Hoſuanus</hi> by name, for ſo I find him called in <hi>Dietricus,</hi> though this Authour calls him <hi>Iloſuanus,</hi> miſtaking belike the copy which he tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. Now <hi>Dietricus</hi> relates it as out of <hi>Georgius Major</hi> as this Author doth. But I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not a little that <hi>Oſiander</hi> in his laſt Century makes no mention of it, that I can find, though I have ſearched after it, as the Woman in the Goſpell did after her loſt groat: Whether he gave any credit to <hi>Georgius Major</hi> his relation, I know not; or whether any thing came to his knowledge afterwards, as touching the unfaithfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof. But take we it as it lyes in this Authours relation.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. That he profeſſed himſelfe of <hi>Calvins</hi> and <hi>Austins</hi> opinion: I hope this makes no more againſt <hi>Calvin</hi> and us, then it doth againſt <hi>Auſtin</hi> and all thoſe that tooke part with him, againſt the Pelagians in his dayes, and the remnants of them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But if his opinion was, that men are not dealt withall <hi>ſecundum bona</hi> or <hi>mala opera, but that there are occultiores cauſae of mens Eternall conditions,</hi> will any ſober Arminian impute this unto us? Doe we ſay that God damnes any man but for ſinne, or that God rewards any man of ripe yeares with Salvation but by way of reward, of theire faith repentance and good-workes? When the Remonſtrants at the Hague con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference propoſed their doctrine of predeſtination and reprobation, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, namely, That God from eternity did ordaine to ſave believers and to damne unbelievers, (to this effect), Did any of the Contra-Remonſtrants, or any of the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> except againſt the truth of this? But whereas the Remonſtrants and Arminians did acknowledge this to be the whole decree of predeſtination and reprobation: Againſt this exception was tooke both in the Hague conference, and in the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> and <hi>Theſes</hi> alſo by divers forraine Divines laid downe againſt it, &amp; particularly by our <hi>Brittayne</hi> Divines amongſt others; All of them maintaining that there was an other decree concerning the giving of the grace of regeneration, of the grace of faith and repentance unto ſome, and denying it unto others. And this decree, we willingly maintain, proceeds not, no not in the execution thereof, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to mens workes good or evill, whatſoever be the end of any that maintaine it. The contrary, namely, that grace is given according unto workes, being a doctrine generally condemned in the Church from the yeare 415, at that time it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the Synod of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and <hi>Pelagius</hi> himſelfe driven to ſubcribe unto it, otherwiſe himſelf had been anathematized. But this Authour delivers it as the opinion of <hi>Hoſuanus</hi> concerning mens Eternall conditions, whereby I take to be meant Salvation and Damnation. And indeed as here the doctrine is expreſſed, it is more agreable with the doctrine of the Predeſtinarians, as <hi>Sigebert</hi> relates it, then with the doctrine either of <hi>Auſtin</hi> or <hi>Calvin:</hi> and the ſame <hi>Sigebert</hi> writes not that it was <hi>Austins</hi> doctrine, but that it roſe out of the miſunderſtanding of <hi>Auſtins writings:</hi> Yet I confeſſe that <hi>Tyro Proſper</hi> before <hi>Sigebert</hi> ſpares not to profeſſe, of that Predeſtinarian hereby, that it roſe from <hi>Austin;</hi> as Dr <hi>Vſher</hi> obſerveth. But this was a meere practice
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:56120:140"/>
of the Semi-Pelagians, corrupting the doctrine of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> the better to expoſe it to obloquy and reproach. 2. As for the ſecond, <hi>that he was one of the woefull company of abſolute caſtawayes.</hi> Herein the Author of this diſcourſe accomodates himſelfe to his own ſtage; Throughout <hi>Dietricus</hi> his relation, I find no mention of any ſuch diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as of reprobates and abſolute reprobates, but an acknowledgement, <hi>certum eſſe numerum ſalvandorum, &amp; praedeſtinatorum vel ad vitam, vel ad mortem;</hi> And of himſelfe, that he was <hi>ex numero damnatorum,</hi> but I doe not find the word <hi>abſolute</hi> throughout. That his life was none of the worſt, himſelfe was no competent judge: yet I confeſſe there are degrees of prophaneneſſe and hypocriſy, and the very reprobates are not equall in ſinne. And withall a morall life is eſteemed in the world in reſpect of their converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards men; but we know that to deny Gods truth, and to oppoſe it againſt the light of conſcience, is of an higher nature in the ſight of God, and uſually is of more fearfull conſequence. Of <hi>Francis Spira</hi> I find no complaints made in reſpect of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality towards men, but he laid unto his own charge, <hi>That he had ſinned againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.</hi> Yet neither this <hi>Hoſuanus,</hi> nor <hi>Spira</hi> doe I find to have broken forth into any blaſphemy againſt Gods juſtice in reprobating them. Nay, this latter was heard ſtrangely to diſcourſe of the juſtice of God, without any murmuring againſt his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And in our time we have heard of ſtrange examples, of ſome that have gone ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly on to the deſtroying of themſelves, in a very devout acknowledgement of Gods juſtice in giving them over.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. As touching the dreadfull apprehenſions of Gods wrath, I nothing doubt, but when God gives men over to the power of Satan, they may be ſo improved by him, as to make a man weary of his life, though I find not this ſpecified in <hi>Dietricus,</hi> who yet relates this ſtory out of <hi>Georgius Major.</hi> But I read the like in <hi>Goulartius</hi> his collections of a deſperate man in his time dying, that ſaid <hi>(among many other horrible ſpeeches) that he wiſhed to be already in Hell. And being demanded the cauſe of ſo wicked a deſire: For that</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the apprehenſion of torments which doe attend me, cauſe me preſently to feele a double Hell; when I ſhall feele it at the full, I ſhall not exſpect it any more.</hi> But no mention throughout of any opinion of his concerning Divine reprobation that moved him thereunto. The words here alleadged, <hi>Diſcedo ad lacus infernales, Deo vos commendo, cujus miſericordia mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi negata eſt.</hi> Theſe, I ſay, and the matter of theſe alone, I find in <hi>Dietericus</hi> his relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of <hi>Georgius Major</hi> on 2 <hi>Tym. c.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 59. 6. It runs thus. <q>Ait in Hungaria &amp; multis aliis locis notiſſimum eſſe de homine quodam Calviniano, Petro Hoſuano Rectore Scholae Gengerinae, qui ex deſperatione ſibi ipſi laqueo injecto vitam fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, Anno 1562. die 22.

Verum eſt certum eſſe numerum ſalvandorum; hoc ex me, ſed quid ad me? Hoc ità neceſſariò fieri debuit. Nemo igitur argumentetur, Deus omnes vocat; longe ſecùs ſe res habet.

Et addit Major haec verba, Hic eſt fructus perverſae do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinae de praedeſtinatione hominum.</q> Concerning which relation give me leave to obſerve ſomewhat.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Here is no ſuch thing as this Author relates, that <hi>Hoſuanus</hi> ſhould ſay that man by <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Auſtins</hi> opinion, is not dealt withall, <hi>ſecundum bona</hi> or <hi>mala ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> (and indeed this deciphering out of <hi>Auſtins</hi> and <hi>Calvins</hi> opinion, is notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly untrue;) neither as touching <hi>occultiores cauſae,</hi> of mens eternall conditions, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is apparent, that in the way of a cauſe meritorious, there is no other cauſe of damnation then ſinne, and in the way of a diſpoſing cauſe no other cauſe of ſalvation then faith, repentance, and good workes; And as touching the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of both, none is or can be the cauſe thereof but God. But as touching the cauſe why God gives grace to one, and denyes it to another, wee willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe there is no cauſe thereof, but the meere good pleaſure of God. In like ſort, of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute caſt-awayes here is no mention, no nor of <hi>Vas formatum ad ignominiam,</hi> nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch ſaying of himſelfe, that he was none of the worſt.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. Here is no mention made of the cauſe moving him hereunto, as this Author
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:56120:141"/>
pretends, but only 'tis ſaid, that it proceeded of deſperation. And though <hi>Major</hi> adds as a <hi>Coronis</hi> his cenſure, that, <hi>Hic eſt fructus perverſae doctrinae de praedestinatione hominum;</hi> yet I hope his cenſure is no Oracle with us, no nor with Lutherans neither; for I find him branded by <hi>Oſiander</hi> in his Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory. And though he were of <hi>Austins</hi> and <hi>Calvins</hi> opinion in this poynt of predeſtination, and did deſpaire, yet it followes not, that this doctrine moved him to deſpaire. Suppoſe the conceit of being a reprobate moved him hereunto; might it not move him hereunto according to the Arminian tenet, as well, and according to any tenet, provided they doe not believe that God hath as yet decreed nothing, or if he hath, that his decrees may be recalled? And then again by our Doctrine of Predeſtination it cannot be concluded of any man that he is a reprobate while he lives. Nay, this ſeems contrary to his own opinion, which was this, that <hi>no man can know whether he be predeſtinate to life or death, till the houre of his death;</hi> and his death was not brought upon him, but wrought by him. And as it was in his power not to have killed himſelfe, ſo was it in his power not to believe that he was a reprobate by this opinion of his. Then again, what moved him to conceive that he was a reprobate, is concealed all along. Now the conſcience of ſinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the Holy Ghoſt, may make a man conceive he is a reprobate, of what opinion ſo ever he be concerning reprobation. And as I take it, <hi>That famous Doctor of Germany, whom Goulartius mentioneth remaining then at Hall in Swabe, was no Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt;</hi> of whom he reports out of the Hiſtory of Germany, <hi>That having oftentimes turned his Conſcience, ſome times toward God, ſome times toward the World, having inclined in the end to the worſer part, ſaid and confeſt publiquely, that he was undone, and fell ſo deepe into deſpaire, as he could neither receive, nor take any comfort or conſolation,</hi> ſo as in this miſerable and wretched eſtate of his ſoule, he ſlew himſelfe moſt miſerably. It was not the doctrine of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination or Reprobation brought him unto this. And though a man hath not ſinned againſt the holy Ghoſt, yet a conceit of ſuch a ſinne may drive a man unto this; or of blaſphemies in an inferior degree, when God gives a man over unto the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, as <hi>Gaulartius</hi> makes mention by his own experience of another deſperate man, whom he had heard, <q>who being exhorted to turne from the too vehement appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Gods juſtice unto his mercy, which was open unto him: He anſwered very coldly, you ſay true, God is God, but of his children, not for me, his mercy is certain for his elect, but I am a reprobate, a veſſell of wrath and curſing, and I doe already feele the torments of Hell: When they did exhort him to call God his Father, and Jeſus Chriſt his Sonne, My mouth (ſaith he) doth ſpeake it, but my heart hath horrour of it, I believe that he is the Father of others, but not of mee: When they did lay before him that he had known God, heard his word, and received his Sacrament; yea but (he added) I was an hypocrite, and guilty of many blaſphemies againſt God; And then he returned to his ordinary diſcourſes; I am a veſſell prepared to wrath and damnation, I am damned, I burne.</q> The ſame <hi>Goulartius</hi> reports out of the Hiſtory of the times of a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man at <hi>Lovaine,</hi> called Maſter <hi>Gerlach,</hi> 
                                 <q>Who had profited ſo well in his ſtudies, as he was one of the firſt amongſt the learned of that time. And that being touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a grievous ſickneſſe, he ſighed continually; and feeling himſelfe to draw neer his end, he began to diſcover the ground of his ſighes, ſpeaking ſuch fearfull words, as deſperate men are accuſtomed to utter; crying out and lamenting that he had lived very wickedly, and that he could not endure the judgement of God, for that he knew his ſinnes were ſo great, as he ſhould never obtain pardon, ſo as in this diſtreſſe he dyed, oppreſſed with grievous and horrible deſpaire.</q> What this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his was in ſpeciall it ſeems he concealed; it might be horrible enough, though done in ſecret, yet no juſt cauſe of deſpaire, unleſſe it were the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt. The like is recorded of M. <hi>Iames Latomus</hi> one of the chiefe Doctors of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Lovaine,</hi> being one day out of countenance in a Sermon before the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fift, returning aſhamed and confounded from <hi>Bruſſells</hi> to <hi>Lovaine,</hi> and did ſo apprehend the diſhonour, that he fell ſuddainly into deſpaire, whereof he gave many teſtimonies in publique; the which did move his friends to keepe him cloſe in his houſe, from that time unto his laſt gaſp. Poore <hi>Latomus</hi> had no other ſpeech then that he was rejected of God, that he was damned, and that he hoped for no mercy nor ſalvation, as having malitiouſly made warre againſt the grace and truth of God. He dyed in this deſpaire, neither was it poſſible for any friends, or Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to make him change his opinion.</p>

3. If this ſtory of <hi>Hoſuanus</hi> be a truth, I like his condition the worſe for not giving any reaſon moving him to this deſperation, and making him to conceive that he was a caſtaway. For it is apparent that by our Doctrine the way is open, (namely by faith in Chriſt) to be perſwaded that he is an elect of God, but no way open to conceive that he is a reprobate. Not any ſinne before faith, for faith in Chriſt gives ſufficient aſſurance of the pardon of all former ſinnes, nor yet want of faith, for though a man want faith to day, yet he may enjoy it to morrow, as <hi>Palmer</hi> told the Sheriffe that executed him, ſaying, <hi>As it hath pleaſed God to call me to day, ſo it may pleaſe him to call you to morrow.</hi> Leaſt of all was the conſideration of the great number of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in compariſon with the ſmall number of Gods elect, likely to be the cauſe thereof; neither is any ſuch mentioned either of <hi>Hoſuanus</hi> or of <hi>Spira,</hi> or of <hi>Latomus,</hi> or of <hi>Krans,</hi> or of any other that ever I heard or read, which is ſufficient to diſcredit this Authors diſcourſe in this place.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. Laſtly, obſerve the abſurdity of this ſpeech, <hi>Commendo vos Deo, cujus miſericordia mihi negata eſt:</hi> Though he had no heart to commend himſelfe to Gods mercy, yet he takes heart to commend others thereunto, as if God though he would ſhew no mercy to him, yet for his ſake, and his prayers, and commendation ſake, he would ſhew mercy unto others.</p>

                              <p>One ſtory more; for I am compelled unto it by the Genius of this adverſary. The day before I entred upon this Section, a Gentleman of good quality coming to this Towne, ſent unto me, deſiring to enjoy my company with him at his Inne. I had heard well of him before, both of his ſervice in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and at the Iſle of <hi>Ree.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things, he fell upon diſcourſe of the good diſcipline in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> eſpecially as touching the preparation of the people to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, both by preparatory Sermons before the day comes, as alſo by going to their houſes, to know of their purpoſe to come to the Lords table; and whether any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them and their neighbours were any impediment thereunto. In this courſe of theirs one coming to a certain houſe, the Maſter whereof and his Wife were turned Arminians, and making the uſuall motion unto the Wife (for her husband was not within) ſhe beganne to raile upon him, and to defye him, and to profeſſe her diſdaine to come to their Communion at all. The Miniſter uſed not many words, but as ſoone as he heard whereto her ſpeech tended, departed; not long after the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the houſe coming home, and hearing the Miniſter had been there, and where abouts he beganne to raile much more then his Wife, diſdaining and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the Miniſter ſhould come unto him about ſuch a buſineſſe, and calling him black Devill, with proteſtation that if he had been at home when the other came, he would have had his bloud or trodden out his guts. That night this Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Bedlem fell ſick, and in his weakneſſe vomited bloud, which not only came out of his mouth, but out of his noſe, eyes and eares, as it is ſaid. Hereupon he ſent for the Miniſter, who came unto him, when he came he confeſſed his fault and fury
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:56120:142"/>
againſt him, beſeeching him to pardon him, The Miniſter exhorted him to make his peace with God, for as for himſelfe he had not offended him, and gave him the beſt comfort he could; never the leſſe the fellow dyed. The Gentleman, that made this relation to my ſelfe and an other with me, upon the noyſe of ſo ſtrange a buiſineſſe, thought good to enquire of the truth; and comming to <hi>Leyden</hi> (there was this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy acted) he went to his Painter, whom he meant to employ in drawing his picture, and asked him about the matter: This Painter was alſo become an Arminian, and told him, that indeed the Man had raved againſt the Miniſter in the ſtreet, but the manner of his death was nothing ſo as he had heard. After this, the ſame Gentleman paſſing over from Flaunders ſide unto <hi>Dort;</hi> as he was in the boat, asked the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the truth of this report. This Boatman alſo was an arminian, and he tells him it was nothing ſo, but that the man dyed by accident, as any other man might; An other in the boat hearing this, turnes to the Gentleman, ſaying, Captaine, believe him not, for the ſtory you have heard is a certaine truth, but this Rogue (ſayeth he poynting to the Boat-man) is an Arminian, and theſe Arminians are like the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, let God ſhew never ſo many miracles and judgements upon them, yet they will not believe; I proteſt I doe nothing affect them, nor pleaſe my ſelfe in theſe and ſuch like relations, but I am driven to it, to requite the adverſary, who helpes out his hungry diſcourſe with ſuch tales as theſe.</p>

                           <p>IT leaves men in temptation: and this it doth two waies, Firſt by making the tempted unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of true comfort. 2. By making Miniſters unable to give true comfort. Firſt it maketh the tempted uncapable of true comfort; like a Gorgons head, it doth ſo trouble their fancies, and amaze them, eſpecially in their paroxyſmes and fits, that the ſtrongeſt arguments of comfort, applyed with as much art and cunning as can be, will not faſten upon them. With <hi>David</hi> they ſay in their feare, that all men are lyars, namely, all ſuch as come to comfort them in their temptation: And the reaſon is, becauſe it is an opinion incompatible with any word of comfort, that can be miniſtred to the diſtreſſed ſoule in this temptation. Gods love to mankind, Chriſts death for all mankind, and the calling of poore ſinners without exception to repentance or ſalvation, with all other grounds of conſolation. the tempted will eaſily elude with the grounds of his opinion: which that we may the better ſee, let us imagine that we heare a Miniſter and a tempted ſoule, reaſoning in this or the like manner.</p>

And God hath a two-fold love, (as I have learned,) a generall love, which puts forth it ſelfe in outward and temporall bleſſings only, and with this he loved all men: And a ſpeciall love, by which he provideth everlaſting life for men, and with this he loves only a very few, which out of his alone will and pleaſure he ſingled from the reſt. Under this generall love am I, not the ſpeciall.</p>

                              <p>God hath founded an univerſali Covenant with men, upon the blood of Chriſt thy Mediator, and therefore he intended it ſhould be ſhed for all men univerſally.

                              <p>God purpoſed his Sonne ſhould dye for all men, and that in his name an offer of remiſſion of ſinnes and ſalvation ſhould be made to every one but yet upon this condition, that they will doe that which he meanes the greateſt part of them ſhall never doe, <hi>(ideſt)</hi> Repent and Believe, nor I among the reſt.</p>

                              <p>God hath a true meaning that all men who are called, ſhould repent and believe; that ſo they might be ſaved: as he would have all to be ſaved, ſo to come to the knowledge of the truth; and as he would have no man to periſh, ſo he would have all men to repent; and therefore he calls them in the Preaching of the word to the one, as well as to the other.</p>

                           <sp>

                              <p>God hath a double call; an outward call by the Preaching of the word, an inward call by the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible work of the ſpirit in mens hearts. The outward call is a part of Gods outward will, with that he calls every man to believe; the inward and effectuall call is a part of his ſecret will, and with that he doth not call every man to believe, but a very few only whom he hath infallibly and inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ordained to eternall life. And therefore by the outward will, which I enjoy among many others, I cannot be aſſured of Gods good will and meaning that I ſhall believe, repent, and be ſaved.</p>
                           </sp>
                           <p>By this we may ſee, that no ſound comfort can be faſtned upon a poore ſoule, rooted in this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, when he lyes under this horrible temptation; The example of <hi>Francis Spira</hi> an Italian Lawyer, will give ſome farther light and proofe to this. This <hi>Spira</hi> about the yeare 1548, againſt his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conſcience did openly abjure his religion, and ſubſcribe to Popery; that thereby he might preſerve his life, and goods, and liberty. Not long after he fell into a deep diſtreſſe of Conſcience out of which he could never wreſtle, but ended his woefull daies in deſpaire. To comfort him came many Divines of worth and note; but againſt all the comforts that they applyed unto him, he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed two things eſpecially. 1. The greatneſſe of his ſinne: It was a ſinne of a deep dye, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many urging and aggravating circumſtances, and therefore could not be forgiven. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument they quickly took from him, and convinced him by the example of <hi>Peter,</hi> that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his ſinne, that could make it irremiſſible. <hi>Peter</hi> that committed the ſame ſinne, and with more odious circumſtances, repented and was pardoned, and ſo (no doubt) might he. 2: He oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his abſolute reprobation; and with that he put off all their comforts. <hi>Peter</hi> (ſaith he) repented and was pardoned indeed, becauſe he was elected: as for me I was utterly rejected before I was borne; and therefore I cannot poſſibly repent, or be ſaved. If any man be elected he ſhall be ſaved, though he have committed ſinnes, for number many, and haynous in degree: but if he be <hi>(ex repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatis)</hi> one of the caſtawaies, <hi>neceſſario condemnabitur:</hi> though his ſinnes be ſmall and ſew. <hi>Nihil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, an multa, an pauca, an magna, an parva ſint, quando nec Dei miſericordia, nec ſanguis Chriſti quicquam ad eos pertinet.</hi> A reprobate muſt be damned, be his ſinnes many or few, great or ſmall; becauſe Gods mercy, and Chriſts merits belong not to him. In this very ſtory, (recorded by <hi>Coelius Secundus,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> with ſome others who lived at that time, and wrote of it to their friends;) as in a glaſſe we may ſee the diſconſolate condition of a poore ſoule, that is ſtrongly conceited, that the greateſt part of the world, are abſolute reprobates, and that he is one of them; he ſticketh ſo faſt in the mire and clay, that he can very hardly be drawne out.</p>

                              <p>THis Section I may fitly divide into two parts. The firſt whereof is a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Comedy. The ſecond a Tragedy. The firſt is practiſed by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour in a dialogue, ſhaped by himſelfe and accordingly accomodated to his owne ſtage, as an Enterlude of his owne making. The Tragedy is related only of <hi>Francis Spira;</hi> and I willingly confeſſe, It is the ſtrangeſt that ever, I heard or read, of a man going on ſoberly to the utter undoing of himſelfe both body and ſoule. But the relation of it is moſt hungryly performed by this Authour as if his care were
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:56120:143"/>
only to ſerve his owne turne, and then cares not what becomes of the maine condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtory, which indeed is moſt remarkable: I have but touched upon it in former paſſages, but here I ſhall inſiſt upon it more at large; and the rather, becauſe it is here propoſed not more unfaithfully then impiouſly, to deface or out-face the precious truth of God concerning his abſoluteneſſe in making whom he will a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of wrath. But firſt I muſt diſpatch my anſwer to the Antegredients of thoſe two parts. And let it be remembred what formerly I have delivered, that ſtill he confounds reprobation from grace, with reprobation from glory; as if we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the abſoluteneſſe of the one, as well as we do maintain the abſoluteneſſe of the other; which is moſt untrue. For albeit, we maintaine that God hath decreed abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to beſtow grace upon ſome, (which are Gods elect,) and abſolutely to deny grace unto others, (whom we account Reprobates here upon,) not conditionally; for if grace were ordayned to be beſtowed conditionally, to wit, upon condition of ſome worke performed by man; then ſhould grace be beſtowed according unto workes, which in the phraſe of the Ancients is all one, with ſaying, that grace is beſtowed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto merits. And this was condemned above 1200 yeares agoe in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pelagius</hi> driven to ſubſcribe unto it, leſt otherwiſe himſelfe had bin excommunicated. But we, doe not maintain that God hath ordayned that damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall be abſolutely inflicted on any but only conditionally, to wit, in caſe they dye in ſin. Yet it became this Authors wiſdom to confound them, leaſt diſtinguiſhing them as they ought to be diſtinguiſhed, &amp; carrying himſelfe fairly in oppoſing the abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of reprobation there alone, where alone it is maintained by his adverſaries, to wit, in the particular of reprobation from grace, he ſhould at firſt daſh manifeſt himſelfe to maintain, that grace is beſtowed not according to the good pleaſure of God, but according to the workes of men; and that upon this ground it is, that he buildeth the comfortable condition of his doctrine, concerning predeſtination, which indeed makes no difference in Gods proceedings between the elect and reprobate, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects them all alike; For their power to believe and repent is their grace univerſall, which they ſay is given to all alike. So exciting grace in the miniſtry of the Word is equally made to all that heare it, whether elect or reprobate. And theſe are the kinds of grace prevenient: Then as for grace ſubſequent, that conſiſts only in Gods concurrence unto the act of faith and repentance which depends meerely upon mans will (in their opinion) and God is as ready to concurre to the working of it as well in one as in another, in caſe man will. On the other ſide it would appeare that our doctrine is cenſured as uncomfortable, only becauſe it teacheth man for the obtaining of true comfort to depend meerely upon the grace of God, and not upon his owne free-will.</p>
                              <p>Againe, obſerve how that like as <hi>Gregory</hi> obſerves that the ſame ſpirit of Antichriſt might be found in them that are farre diſtant in time, ſo an Arminian ſpirit ſavoreth the ſame things one with an other, and perhaps at unawars, though they in whom it is found be much diſtant in place. <hi>Voſſius</hi> in his laſt booke of his <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the Pelagian hereſy ſayth, That our Divines doe aleadge that place of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                                 <hi>Paul</hi> againſt their adverſaries in the poynt of predeſtination, as the head of <hi>Meduſa;</hi> a place indeed that clearely juſtifies Gods abſoluteneſſe both in predeſtination and reprobation: And this Authour ſayeth that our doctrine on the ſame poynt is like to <hi>Gorgons</hi> head: Now the Learned well know that <hi>Gorgon</hi> and <hi>Meduſas</hi> head have no difference. Now whether our doctrine be ſo uncomfortable as this Authour objects, it will appeare when we come to examine the paroxyſme and fit of temptation, eſpecially the kind of it being ſuch, as this Authour out of his fruitfull invention hath made choyce of to repreſent, as able to elude the ſtrongeſt <hi>arguments of comfort, and they applyed with as much art and cunning as canne be;</hi> ſuppoſing that of this art and cunning alſo, he hath given plentifull teſtimony in the ſucceeding dialogue; which is a very remarkeable paſſage of this Authours ſufficiency, eſpecially comming out of his owne mouth; Of the integrity whereof there ſeemes no cauſe to doubt, conſidering that Arminian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and modeſty whereunto he hath lately arrived.</p>
                              <p>He further addes as much weight to his former aſſertions as words can, which though they be but wind, yet with ſome, who Camelion like live by the ayre, may prove very weighty, ſaying, that this doctrine of ours is incompatable with any word of comfort (which is very much, though a word and any word be very little) <hi>that can be miniſtred to a diſtreſſed ſoule in this temptation.</hi> Now it is very likely that in his dialogue
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:56120:143"/>
following he brings in as potent arguments of conſolation, as our doctrine will afford. The heads or placss of conſolation he reckons up, <hi>Gods love to mankind, Chriſts death for all mankind, and the calling of poore ſinners without exception to repentance and Salvation with all other grounds of comfort,</hi> and all arguments (he ſayeth) drawne from hence our opinion will elude and preclude all conſolation from the diſtreſſed ſoule. But give me leave to make a faire motion as touching the ſpeciall heades of conſolation here particulated. If it ſhall be found that theſe heads of conſolation doe admit a double ſenſe, one of the Arminian making, an other of our interpreting; if conſolations drawne therefrom in an Arminian ſence be eluded by our Tenet, will any diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereby ariſe to our tenet, provided we find ſtore of conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from them taken in our ſenſe, eſpecially being ready to admit any indifferent tryal concerning the ſenſe thereof, whether theirs or ours prove moſt agreeable to the word of God; But <hi>Ecce Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, ecce Saltus,</hi> we are come to the Dialogue it ſelfe, where he undertakes to make good, that which he ſaith And here begins the Enterlude.</p>

                                    <hi>but the things revealed are for us and for our Children to doe them.</hi> Now where, and when, and how hath God revealed this his counſell unto thee, namely, concerning thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection from Grace, &amp; Glory? We know no other revelations divine then are contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his Word: Now hath God in his word revealed unto thee more then unto me that thou art a reprobate. The word ſaith unto thee, <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſſe with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus: and believe in thy heart that God raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved, Rom:</hi> 10. 9. Now how canſt thou make it appeare that this belongs leſſe unto thee then to any Martyr that ever was content to lay downe his life for Chriſt? Wilt thou ſay, <hi>Thy ſinnes make thee to conceive ſo:</hi> I anſwer, are thy ſinnes greater then were the ſinnes of <hi>Manaſſes, who made his ſonnes paſſe through the fire to Molech, gave himſelfe to witchcraft and ſorcery, and filled Jeruſalem with bloud from corner to corner?</hi> If his ſinns were not ſufficient to conclude that he was a Reprobate, why ſhould thy ſins be thought ſufficient to conclude that thou art a Caſt-away? Are thy ſinnes greater then <hi>Sauls</hi> were, <hi>who was a Blaſphemer, a Perſecutor of the Saints of God from Citty to Citty;</hi> Yet was he received unto mercy. Wilt thou ſay, <hi>Thy ſinnes have been committed ſince thy calling?</hi> Yet are they greater then was the ſinne of <hi>Peter,</hi> in denying Chriſt his Maſter, with execrations and oathes? And theſe ſinns were committed not only after his calling; but even within his Maſters hearing too. Yet he went out and wept bitterly. And Chriſt as ſoone as he was riſen, ſent word of his reſurrection by name to <hi>Peter</hi> to comfort him. Nay hath not God taught us in his word, that the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſinne, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 1.? And how canſt thou make it appeare, that any one that ever was or is, hath greater intereſt therein then thy ſelfe? wilt thou ſay this remedy belongs unto none, but ſuch as believe and repent; but I doe not. I anſwere, in like ſort there was a time when <hi>Paul</hi> believed not, and when every one believed not; yet at length they believed, and ſo maiſt thou: wilt thou ſay, <hi>But I cannot believe and repent?</hi> I anſwer, this is the condition of all till God <hi>takes away the ſtony heart out of their bowells, and gives them a heart of fleſh, and puts his owne ſpirit within them;</hi> wilt thou ſay <hi>God gives grace to others, but not to thee?</hi> I anſwer, there was a time when God had not mercy on them, at length an houre came wherin he called them: ſo an houre may come wherin he may call thee. And thou haſt no more cauſe to conclude that he hath rejected thee, then every Child of God had before his calling, that God had rejected him: without grace neither thou canſt, nor they could believe; but grace can bring all to faith and repentance; and thou haſt no more cauſe to think that God will not bring thee to faith, then any elect had, before his calling, to think that God would not bring him to faith. Now ſeeing this grace is given in the Word, doe thou wait upon God in his owne ordinance, (which any naturall man hath power to doe; as namely, to goe heare a ſermon)

If he hath not, but damnation rather unto ſome, and particularly to this ſoule; (for upon what ground dareſt thou ſay, or canſt aſſure he hath not:) art not thou as miſerable a comforter to her, as ever <hi>Jobs</hi> friends were to him? Or hath God ordained to give all men the grace of regeneration, the grace of faith and repentance; if ſo, then either abſolutely or conditionally; if abſolutely, then all muſt be regenerate, all muſt believe and repent. If conditionally, ſpeake it out, and let thy Patient know what condition that is, on performance whereof by man, God will give him faith; ſay what thou wilt, the comfortable iſſue ſhall be this, That <hi>grace is given according to workes;</hi> and this indeed is the only Arminian conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

If hatred be no more then diſpleaſure; ſurely whatſoever be the cauſe of it, in hating thee he is diſpleaſed with thee, as thou art his creature, and that in thy proper kind of man; if withall it ſignify puniſhment, whatſoever the cauſe thereof be, ſurely he puniſheth thee as man, though not for thy natures ſake, for that is the worke of God, but for ſome corruption he finds in thee.

No Arminian hath the face to deny that God ſaves but a very few; And the reaſon is, becauſe very few doe believe and repent: in this we all agree. Againe, no Arminian denies that very few doe believe and repent, and finally perſevere therein. Againe, no Arminian denies faith and repentance to be the gift of God, and that hereby alone men are ſingled out from the reſt. Now the queſtion is, Whether God ſingleth out ſome men from the reſt by giving them faith and repentance according to the meere pleaſure of his will, or according to their workes? We ſay, according to the meere pleaſure of Gods will, <hi>for he hath mercy on whom he will. Rom:</hi> 9. 18.

If thou doeſt deſire this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and to that purpoſe haſt an hungry appetite after the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; thy Saviour ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe, for they ſhall be filled.</hi> Or haſt thou a deſire to have thy ſinnes pardoned, and thy ſoule ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but not any deſire that thy ſoule may be ſanctified; what comfort ſhouldeſt thou or any ſuch expect at the hands of God? Thou wouldeſt ſerve the Devill, but thou, wouldeſt not goe to hell with the Devill. But I tell thee, God hath decreed the contrary, namely, that all ſuch ſhall have this doome; <hi>Goe ye curſed into everlaſting fire prepared for the Devill and his Angells.</hi> Yet I will not leave thee, nor give over all hope of thee; for I am glad to heare thee confeſſe, that though thou deſireſt thy ſinne may be pardoned, and thy ſoule ſaved, yet thou haſt no deſire that thy ſoule ſhould be ſanctified; therefore anſwer me but to one thing more, and I have done with thee; Is it thy griefe and ſorrow, that thou haſt no deſire, that thy nature may be ſanctified, or is it no griefe at all unto thee? If it be no griefe unto thee, then ſtill thou takeſt delight in ſinne; and how can delight in ſinne, ſtand with the feare of Gods judgements, and if thou feareſt not God, how canſt thou breake out into ſuch complaints, <hi>Woe is me for I am a Caſt-away:</hi> Theſe motions uſually proceed from the terrours of God; And if thou art once acquainted with Gods terrours, in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of thy ſinnefull condition; then be of good cheere, for theſe ſymptomes are commonly as the pangs of Child-birth, whereby it comes to paſſe, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſoule is at length brought forth into the world of grace.

And if it be not <hi>adulter ſenſus,</hi> to apply this to all and every one, here is comfort indeed with a witneſſe; For if God will ſave every one; and withall can ſave them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is no doubt to be made, then there are no Reprobates at all; every one is predeſtinate to ſalvation by the will, that is, by the decree of God; <hi>And who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſisted his will,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul.</hi> And will he not have all &amp; every one to believe &amp; repent? If not, then ſeeing he will have all to be ſaved, it follows that God, wil have all men to be ſaved, whether they believe or no, repent or no; But if he will have all to believe &amp; repent, by that will whereby he will have all to be ſaved; ſeeing God can give all men faith and repentance; what followes but that all and every one ſhall believe and repent, &amp; be ſaved, and conſequently, there are no Reprobates at all? But I know full well what their interpretation of this is, namely, that God is ready to give faith and repentance unto all, to wit, in caſe they will; but doth not God give the very will to believe and repent? Yes in caſe they will. Take this comfort then into thy boſome, and make the beſt uſe of it to perſwade thee that thou art no caſt-away; For if thou believeſt and repenteſt, all is ſafe, thou haſt as good aſſurance of thy ſalvation as Gods word can give thee. And though faith
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56120:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and repentance be the gift of God, yet this comforter doth aſſure thee, that <hi>if thou wilt believe thou ſhalt believe, if thou wilt repent thou ſhalt repent.</hi> For God doth not give the grace of faith and repentance, according to the meere pleaſure of his own will, but according to mens workes; for albeit the Apoſtle ſaith, God hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth; yet that is not to be underſtood of vocation, but rather of juſtification. And let it not ſtartle thee, that juſtification in Scripture phraſe, is oppoſed to condemnation, and not to obduration, but to thy comfort be it ſpoken, it muſt be oppoſed to obduration here; leaſt otherwiſe faith and repentance ſhould not be given according to mens workes, but according to the meere pleaſure of God; which is a very uncomfortable doctrine. But be thou aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that if thou wilt believe and repent, thou ſhalt believe and repent, ſuch is Gods grace; and though it be as true, I confeſſe, on the other ſide, that if thou wilt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent, thou ſhalt not believe and repent; yet that is not to be accounted Gods grace, leaſt ſo we ſhould ſay, that Gods grace is as active to evill, as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good.

                                 <p>As for the diſtinction of a revealed will, and ſecret will applyed to ſalvation, thou maiſt learne that ſomewhere of Papiſts, but not of us. For the revealed will is Gods commandement; now that which God commands is a part of his Law, ſo is not ſalvation, but rather a reward of obedience. Yet they apply this diſtinction only in reference to faith and repentance, whereunto God hath annexed ſalvation. And it is Gods revealed will that all who heare the Goſpell ſhould believe and repent <hi>ex officio;</hi> but it is not Gods will to give every one of them grace to believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, as we find by manifeſt experience. It was Gods will in like manner to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice his ſonne, but it was not Gods determination that <hi>Iſaack</hi> ſhould be ſacrificed.

And obſerve how he takes notice of no other benefits of Chriſts death, then ſuch as belong unto men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the condition of faith, to wit, pardon of ſinne and Salvation; in which caſe the mention of Gods elect comes in very unſeaſonably. And thus is the love of God ſet forth unto us; <hi>ſo God loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Sonne, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him ſhould not periſh but have everlasting life:</hi> And if it be not thy lot to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongſt believers, then we can give thee, by Gods Word, no aſſurance of thy Salvation.

Chriſt merited them, but not for all, for then all ſhould believe and repent and be ſaved; but only for ſome, and who can theſe be but Gods elect; whence it followeth clearly that whoſoever believes may by our doctrine be aſſured of his election, not ſo by the doctrine of Arminians; but if thou believeſt not thou art in no worſe caſe then the beſt of Gods childern have been; for there was a time when they believed not; therefore thou haſt no more cauſe to think thy ſelfe a caſt-away then they had.</p>

And the truth is, that by our Doctrine, wee were all in a miſerable caſe, if Gods Covenant of grace extended no farther then this. But hath not God promiſed to be our Lord, and our God that ſanctifyeth us, to circumciſe our hearts, and the hearts of our Children, to love the Lord our God <note place="margin">Ezek. 20. 12.

All this, this ſweet comforter takes no notice of, contenting himſelfe with ſuch a grace to be merited for him by Chriſt as this, if he will believe he ſhall believe; if he will repent he ſhall repent; if he will love God with all his heart, he ſhall love him with all his heart.

Indeed we ſay that God doth not meane by his preventing grace to work the wills of the greateſt part of men to believe &amp; repent: Doe not the Arminians ſay ſo too? Yes verily, and a great deale more: for they deny that he workes any mans will to believe and repent in this manner; but we ſay God purchaſeth thus to worke the wills of all his choſen ones, and when he hath wrought them, to keepe <hi>them by his power through faith unto Salvation; and put his feare in their hearts, that they ſhall never depart a way from him. Jer</hi> 32. 40. And upon this <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.

And no example I truſt neither of <hi>Peter,</hi> nor any other was ſufficient to take him off from deſpaire in ſuch a caſe. 2. And as for the diſcourſe here ſuggeſted of his abſolute reprobation, which he oppoſed againſt their comforts miniſtred unto him, no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, neither in <hi>Sleidan,</hi> nor in <hi>Oſiander;</hi> nay <hi>Oſiander</hi> writes that he was wiſh'd to revoke <hi>doctrinam Lutheranam,</hi> and this was it which he did (as he ſayeth) blaſpheme as an hereſy, and abjure. <hi>Goulartius</hi> indeed relates how he conceived himſelfe to be reprobated of God, as juſtly he might in caſe he judged himſelfe to have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt; And as for that which is here ſet down in Latin, of him that is a Reprobate, namely, that <hi>neceſſario condemnabitur,</hi> though his ſins be ſmall &amp; few, &amp; that <hi>nihil interest multa an pauca, magna an parva ſint; quando nec Dei miſericordia, nec Chriſti ſanguis quicquam ad eos pertinet.</hi> Neither <hi>Sleidan,</hi> nor <hi>Oſiander</hi> nor <hi>Goulartius</hi> makes any mention of it.

I imagined it might be in his Epiſtles; I have ſpent ſome houres in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein from the yeare 1545 to the yeare 1663, and can find nothing concerning it. Now <hi>Goulartius</hi> wrote ſince <hi>Caelius ſecundus,</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Sleidan,</hi> and his relation is large; and it ſemes he inquired in to it ſomewhat better then they that went before him.

                                 <p>In a ſmall towne of the territory of <hi>Padua</hi> called <hi>Civitelle</hi> there was a Learned Lawyer, and advocat, a wiſe and very rich, man and an honourable father of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, called <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> who having ſayd and done divers things againſt his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to maintaine himſelfe and his charge, (obſerve by the way he delivers the cauſe only in generall concealing the ſpeciality, it being ſo ſtrang a teſtimony and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt the Romiſh Religion) being returned to his houſe, he could never reſt an houre, not a minut, nor have any eaſe of his continuall anguiſh: And even from that night he was ſo terrified and had ſuch horrour of his actions, as he held himſelfe for loſt. For (as he himſelfe did afterward confeſſe) he did ſet plainely before his eyes, all the torments, all the paines of the damned, and in his ſoule did heare the fearfull ſentences, being drawne before the judgment ſeat of Jeſus Chriſt (a fearfull

example to all Apoſtates;) The next day and ſo following he was not ſeene to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume any courage, but his ſpirits were ſtrangely troubled, and the terrour tooke from him all reſt and appetite. This accident was ſo greivous to his friends, as ſome repented them much that they had beene the cauſe of ſo great an inconvenience, by their intreaties. Others, thinking it did proceed from ſome cholerick or melancholy humour, were of opinion to ſend him to <hi>Padova</hi> to be Phyſicked by the Learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, revived by honorable company, and ſetled by the coference of Learned men there, to ſome of which he was well knowne. His Wife and Children with ſome of his familiar friends did accompany him, and he was lodged in one of the chiefe hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <hi>Friſimilega Bellocat</hi> and <hi>Craſſus</hi> (famous Phyſitians) did viſit him, and give him Phyſicke with ſingular affection: and ſoone found that he was little ſicke in body, but grievouſly in mind, for in all other things he diſcourſed gravely, and conſtanſtly, ſo as none of his familiar friends could diſcerne that the quickneſſe of his diſcourſe was any thing impaired. Continuing ſtill in his weakneſſe, many were much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and dayly his Chamber was full of People; ſome curious to ſee and heare, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were deſirous to draw him to hope in the mercies of God; I was preſent at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his ſpeeches, with ſome men of honour and Learning. To deliver that which I could obſerve, I began firſt to note his age and his faſhion. He was about 50 yeares old, free from the violent paſſions of youth, and from the coldneſſe of old age. Nothing came out of his mouth, that was light or fooliſhly ſpoken: or that might diſcover any doting in him; although he did dayly diſcourſe of grave and important matters with the Learned, and that ſome did propound unto him high queſtions e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in Divinity.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. I will briefly relate ſame ſpeeches they had with him. During his abode at <hi>Padua</hi> and I will not forget that he declared with a ſetled judgment, that he did ſee the eternall vengeance of God prepared againſt the ſinne, that he had committed: (This was the true cauſe of his diſpaire, and not an ungrounded conceit of his reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but the conſcience of his ſinne caſt him upon this, and made him conceive he was a Reprobate.) For that he did find in him ſelfe that thoſe things which God had given to others to rejoyce their ſpirits, all conſpired againſt him in deſpite of his horrible forfeit: (I doubt the phraſe here in the originall was not well underſtood by the Traſlatour;) For although, ſaid he, that God for a great bleſſing had promiſed to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny holy men a goodly iſſue, and a great number of children, in whoſe love and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience they may repoſe their age; yet in the midſt of his miſeries, The hands and faces of his Children were as horrible unto him as the hangmans (and indeed for the good of his children he renounced Gods truth for meere temporall reſpects.) It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be expreſſed what griefe &amp; vexation he ſeemed to receive when his children brought him meat, forcing him to eat, and threatning him when he refuſed it. He confeſſed his children did their dutyes, and yet he tooke it in ill part, ſaying, that he did not acknowledge God any more for his father, but did feare him as his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary armed with judgment. For he had been three weeks in this apprehenſion, when he ſpake these things, without eating or drinking, but what they forced him unto, the which he received with great difficulty, reſiſting with all his power, and ſpitting out that which they forced him to take. Some of the Aſſiſtants were of opinion to make him afraid, to make him the more apt to receive food, firſt for the ſoule, then for the body; asking him if he did not feare greater and ſharper torments after this life then thoſe he then felt. He confeſſed that he expected farre more ſharpe, and had already horror of them: yet he deſired nothing more then to be caſt head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in to them, that he might not feare other more grevious torments. They asked him againe if he thought his ſinne ſo foule as it could not be pardoned through the bounty and infinite mercy of God? His anſwer was, that he had ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which was ſo great a ſinne, as is called a ſinne unto death; that is to ſay, ſubject to the eternall vengeance of God, and to the paines of Hell: (now judge I pray whether the example of <hi>Peter</hi> was ſufficient to take him off from deſperation; for will any ſay that <hi>Peter</hi> in denying his Maſter ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt;) whereof (to wit, the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt) this poore wretch diſcourſed amply, learnedly, and too ſubtilly againſt him ſelfe: Learned and Godly men, which did aſſiſt him, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no teſtimonies that might aſſure a wounded conſcience that God is mercifull, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and ready to pardon. But all this could not divert him from this opinion, neither could they draw any other thing from him, then that he deſired much that
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:56120:148"/>
he might returne to ſome hope of pardon. But it fares with me (ſaith he) as with criminall perſons, ſhut up in cloſe priſons, and fettered hand and foot. Sometimes they are ſaluted by their friends paſſing by, who adviſe them to breake Priſon, and to deceive their guards if they can. Such Priſoners would gladly follow their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, but it is a vaine deſire: Even ſo is mine, ſaid he.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. As for the Scriptures which were cited to him, touching the love and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God the Father, by reaſon of his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, he did avow them; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that they belonged only to them, whom Jeſus Chriſt did repute his brethren, and his members; but as for him, he had renounced that love, and willingly reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted brotherly alliance, neither was ignorant in how great tranquillity of mind they might be, who had once embraced the promiſes of ſalvation, and did wreſt them continually therein. For confirmation whereof, this his ſad diſaſter (ſaid he) was propounded for an example before all mens eyes: that if they were wiſe they ſhould not hold it light, nor happened by any chance, but to learne by his ruine, how dangerous it is, to fall any thing from that which belongs to the great glory of the Sonne of God: Adding that it was a ſlippery, and very dangerous paſſage, yea moſt fearfull to him that ſtood not carefully on his Guard. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over foraſmuch as ſuch evident examples, of the vengeance of Almighty God did ſeldome appeare to the eyes of men, they deſerved to be the more carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. That amongſt a great number of Reprobates in the World, his calamity was not ſingular; but his only puniſhment and ruine did ſatisfy God, a juſt Judge to admoniſh all others to have a care of themſelves. He added withall, that therein he did acknowledge the ſeverity of Gods judgement, who had choſen him to make him a ſpectacle, rather then any other, and to admoniſh all by one mans mouth, to abſtaine from all iniquity; confeſſing withall, that there was no reproach or puniſhment, which he had not deſerved, by reaſon of his foule offence. After he had diſcourſed thus ſincerely and gravely of the juſtice Divine, he ſaid they ſhould not take it ſtrange, this his long ſpeech touching the true reaſon of the will of God: for that oftentimes God doth wreſt out of the mouthes of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, moſt aſſured teſtimonies of his Majeſty, his juſtice, and his fearfull venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. How ſtrangely doth he plead for Gods juſtice againſt himſelfe as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate? when our Arminians are like to blaſpheame that juſtice of God againſt <hi>Spira,</hi> which <hi>Spira</hi> juſtifies againſt himſelfe, uſing a long diſcourſe upon this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and deſirous to ſhew the greatneſſe of Gods judgements. There are ſome (ſaith he) who have all things ſo wiſhfully, as they live in all delights, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding are regiſtred for perdition, whereof Jeſus Chriſt propounds an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the rich man. <hi>Luc.</hi> 16. That God doth often propound to mankind an hope of reward to draw them to the right beliefe of his holy will, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times withdrawes them from impieties, by fearfull and prodigious ſignes. And yet as impiety is naturall to men, they make not their profit of ſuch inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and think not that it concernes them: but impute it to any other thing, rather then to the wiſdome of God, to feare and reverence him: Hereupon he made a bitter invective againſt a certain Philoſopher, whom he had known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twenty years before, for that his Moroſoph had been ſo impudent to deliver in his leſſons, yea to write it, and publiſh it in Print, that all the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that Chriſt had done upon the earth, might well be done by a man that were skilfull in the knowledge of naturall things. It were hard to repreſent the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration wherewith they were ſurprized, and with what compaſſion they were moved, that came to viſit him, for the diſcourſes which they heard come from his mouth. Every man laboured to reduce this poore man, to ſome hope of his ſalvation. Among others there was one, a Reverend man for his holineſſe of life, who departed not from the Patients bed, it was the Biſhop of <hi>Capod' Iſtria</hi> in the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians Territory; (This was <hi>Vergerius,</hi> who afterwards renounced Popery, and became a Proteſtant:) He ceaſed not to exhort <hi>Spira,</hi> and ceaſed not by many te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the holy Scriptures, to divert him from that apprehenſion; Adding that he did not think his ſpirit was altogether voyd and deſtitute, of ſome good and heavenly inſpirations, ſeeing he ſpake ſo holily and devoutly of the excellency of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                                 <p n="4">4. Although the ſick man knew ful well that theſe admonitions proceeded
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:56120:149"/>
from a ſincere and true heart; yet for that he had diverſe times rejected them, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to frowne, ſaying to the Biſhop, you believe, as I think, that I doe willingly nouriſh this obſtinacy in my mind, and that I take delight in this vehement paſſion of deſpaire: If you be of that opinion, you are deceived: I will tell you, to the end you may know my reſolution, that if I could be perſwaded that the judgement of God, might by any meanes be changed or mitigated for mee, it ſhould not grieve me to be tormented ten thouſand yeares, with the ſharpeſt paines of hell, ſo as I might have any hope of reſt after this long ſufferance. But even in that whereby you doe exhort me to gather any hope, I ſee all meanes of health and pardon taken from me. For if the teſtimonies of holy Scripture have any authority (as they have) doe you thinke that Jeſus Chriſt hath ſaid in vaine, that he which hath renounced him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, he will renounce him before his heavenly father? Doe you not ſee that it concernes me, and that it is as it were, particularly verified in my perſon? What ſhall become of him, whom the Sonne hath diſavowed before his Father, when as you ſay, we muſt hope for no ſalvation but in Jeſus Chriſt. Thereupon he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound certain paſſages of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, and of the ſecond Catholique Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> out of which he drew terrible concluſions againſt himſelfe. Wee cannot believe with what gravity and vehemency, his words were delivered, neither was there ever heard man pleading better for himſelfe, then <hi>Spira</hi> did then againſt himſelfe. He did alleadge notable things of Gods juſtice, deteſting his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed life; admoniſhing all that were about him, very earneſtly, not to think that Chriſtian life was a light thing, and eaſily diſcharged. That it doth not conſiſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in having the head Baptiſed, in reading certaine verſes and texts of the Goſpell, and to be termed an honeſt man, but it was needfull to live as the word of truth doth command him. Thereupon he repeated a Text out of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> exhorting us to ſhew through holineſſe of life, certain ſignes of the love of God towards us, and of the confidence we ſhould have in him: He ſaid moreover, that he had known many who after they had taſted the ſweetneſſe of true felicity, ſuffered themſelves ſo to be carried away, as they had no longer care to performe that which belonged to a child of God.</p>
                                 <p n="5">5. He proteſted that he had ſometimes imagined, that his ſinnes had been hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and that he could not be puniſhed, for that Chriſt had made ſatisfaction for them: but then he knew too late, that thoſe things belonged only to the elect, and choſen of God, betwixt whoſe ſinnes, and the celeſtiall Throne, Jeſus Chriſt ſets his precious bloud, and the dignity of his obedience, as a veile and ſhadow to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and doth plant them againſt the Divine vengeance, as an high and ſtrong Rampart, that ſinners repenting them, might not be oppreſt, nor drowned with the deluge and overflowings of their offences and ſinnes. As for himſelfe, ſeeing that he had renounced our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt (here was the true burthen of his ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart) he had, as one ſhould ſay, overthrowne this ſtrong Rampart with his own hands, ſo that after this ruine, and overflowing the deluge of waters of this ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, had covered and ſwallowed up his ſoule. One of his moſt familiar friends ſaid unto him, that he did hold the cauſe of this his great torment, proceeded from abundance of Melancholy humours, that did ſo trouble his braine. <hi>Spira</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that he had many times refuted that opinion, and ſeeing they were to begin againe, ſaid unto the other; You may think what you pleaſe, but God in truth hath troubled my ſpirit, and deprived me of judgement; ſeeing it is impoſſible for me to have any hope of my ſalvation. Having continued in ſuch and the like ſpeeches, during his abode at <hi>Padua,</hi> they carried him back, to his own houſe at <hi>Civitelle,</hi> where he dyed in this deſpaire.</p>

And in another place of the ſame booke, he hath theſe words. <hi>Sicut eſt neceſſe ſcire Evangelium promiſſionem eſſe gratuitam, ita eſt neceſſe ſcire Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelium promiſſionem univerſalem eſſe, hanc univerſalem tenere neceſſe eſt, adverſus periculoſas imaginationes de praedeſtinatione, ne diſputemus hanc promiſſionem ad paucos quoſdam alios pertinere, non pertinere ad nos. Non enim dubium eſt, quin omnium animos haec cogitatio exerceat.</hi> As it is needfull to know that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſalvation is free, ſo it is needfull to know and hold, that it is univerſall, againſt ſome dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conceits of predeſtination, &amp;c. By theſe ſpeeches we ſee clearely, what this learned man thought to be the true balme of Gilead, whereby a wounded ſcule ſhould be cured, <hi>viz.</hi> the univerſality of the promiſe (and of Gods love and Chriſts death too, for they all hang together, and cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned.) The reaſon why theſe grounds are able to help a man in this caſe, is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are directly contradictory to the temptation; a will to ſave all, a giving of Chriſt to death for all, and an offer of grace to all, cannot poſſibly ſtand with an abſolute antecedent will, and intent of caſting away the greateſt part of mankind, or indeed any one man in the world. Upon this followes the ſecond reaſon.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Becauſe they ſerve to convict the tempted, that he cannot be in that condition in which he ſuppoſeth himſelfe to be. For if two contradictories cannot be true, he that evinceth the truth of the one, convinceth the underſtanding of the untruth of the other: and he that makes it appeare that this contradictory, [God would have all to be ſaved, redeemed, and called to repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,] is true, puts it out of doubt to the underſtanding, that the other contradictory, [God will have moſt men to be abſolutely, and inevitably damned,] muſt needs be falſe, and ſo raiſeth up that poore ſoule that was preſſed downe with an erroneous conceit and feare that it was true. In this manner did <hi>Junius</hi> (though not in the ſame temptation) relieve a Woman perplexed exceedingly with a ſtrong perſwaſion, that ſhee and all her Children ſhould be damned; becauſe ſhe was buſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her Children at a certain time, when ſhe ſhould have been at Maſſe. <hi>Junius</hi> maketh ſhort work with her, tells her that her employment about her Children, was a duty pleaſing unto God, but the Maſſe was a meere Will-worſhip: and ſo delivering her of her errour, (upon which the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was built,) gives her preſent eaſe and comfort. In like manner tell a man that feares he is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute reprobate, that there are no ſuch abſolute Reprobates, and that his feare is but a meere fancy, and his doubt a dreame; convince him once by contradictory grounds that there is no man in the World in that ſtate in which he thinkes himſelfe to be, and you drive out one naile by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and expell the temptation. Theſe are the Sword of <hi>Alexander,</hi> which will cut aſunder the <hi>Gordian</hi> knot of abſolute Reprobation, and theſe are the true Nepenthes of a ſicke ſoule.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="280" facs="tcp:56120:150"/>
Now theſe true Grounds of hope and comfort, a Miniſter cannot make uſe of, that holds abſolute Reprobation; if he doe uſurpe them, he cannot maintaine them againſt the replyes of the tempted, unleſſe he relinquiſh his opinion; becauſe (as I have ſaid) there is a plain contradiction between them, and no man is able to maintaine two propoſitions; which ſpeake contrary things, to be both true, any more then he can make it good, that the ſame thing may have a being, and yet not have a being at the ſame time. For example, a Miniſter comes to comfort a man, that thinkes himſelfe to be an abſolute Reprobate; and how doth he ſet about it? He tells him, that God would have all to be ſaved, that Chriſt dyed for all, &amp;c. But what right hath he to theſe grounds of comfort, holding the contrary concluſions. <hi>viz.</hi> That God will have a great many to be damned, and to have no part in Chriſt? Well he uſurpes them notwithſtanding, but is he able to maintaine them againſt the anſwer of the tempted, can he make a good reply? No: for thus the tempted anſwers, God would have all to be ſaved with a revealed will, and, Chriſt died for all ſufficiently, not intentionally: Or if God did intend that he ſhould dye for all, yet he intended it upon a condition, which he purpoſeth, the moſt ſhould never performe; What can the Miniſter reply upon this? If he will make a direct reply, that ſhall take away the anſwer, he muſt deny that God hath two wills contrary to each other; a ſecret will, that many ſhall be unavoydably damned, and a revealed will that all may be poſſibly ſaved; and he muſt alſo deny that God hath an intent, that Chriſt ſhould not dye for a great many; or that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended he ſhould dye for all, upon condition they ſhould believe and repent; and yet intend that the moſt ſhould never believe and repent. But can he deny theſe things? He cannot, except he deny his own concluſion, and opinion, which is, that there are many thouſands, eternally and unavoyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly rejected in Gods abſolute purpoſe, from grace and glory for ever: For that concluſion is all one, with the anſwer of the tempted, and contradictory to thoſe arguments of comfort, which he is glad to make uſe of. Abſolute reprobation therefore, bereaves that Miniſter, who believes it, of the ſolid grounds of conſolation, and ſo makes him unable to recover a poore ſoule wounded with this temptation.</p>

                              </head>
                              <p n="1">1. HEre in this Section the queſtion is, Whether our Doctrine of abſolute Reprobation, bereaves a Miniſter of the ſolid grounds of comfort? Still wee muſt remember how magnificently this Author goes on, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found things that differ. For whereas we maintaine that God hath decreed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed abſolutely with men, only in the giving and denying of grace, not abſolutely in the giving of ſalvation, or inflicting of damnation. And this Author, though he ſo carrieth the matter all along, as if we maintained Gods proceeding to be abſolute herein, to wit, in granting ſalvation to ſome, and inflicting damnation upon others, yet hath he no meanes to help himſelfe herein, and caſt a ſhew of a true crimination, but by flying to Gods abſolute proceedings, in giving or denying grace. And albeit in this poynt, wholly conſiſts the Criſis of this Controverſy, yet this Author utterly declines the ſifting thereof, as ſome precipice and breake-neck unto his cauſe; to wit, Whether God gives and denyes grace according to the meere pleaſure of his will, or according to mens workes; albeit the iſſue of all his comforts comes to this, namely, that either God is not the Author of our faith, (which now adaies the Remonſtrants with open mouth profeſſe, that Chriſt merited for none,) or if to juggle with the World they pretend an acknowledgement, that God is the Author of it, yet they plainly profeſſe, that he diſpenſeth it to ſome, and denyes it to others, according to ſome good condition, or diſpoſition, he findes in the one, and which he findes not in another. But let us take into conſideration what theſe ſolid grounds of comfort are, whereof a Miniſter is bereaved by our Doctrine; Three I find here mentioned; <hi>A treble Univerſality.</hi> 1. <hi>of Gods love.</hi> 2. <hi>Of Chriſts death.</hi> 3. <hi>Of the Covenant of grace.</hi> As if univerſality now adayes were a better Character of the Arminian faith, then of the Roman Religion. I may take liberty to equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a little, when this Authour equivocates throughout, and that in a caſe, wherein i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap> is moſt intollerable, in a caſe of conſolation to be miniſtred to <hi>conſcientia timorata,</hi> as <hi>Nider</hi> calls it, a poore afflicted ſoule as this Authour expreſſeth it. To the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery whereof I will now proceed, having ſignified in the firſt place, that all theſe conſolations are no other, but ſuch as every Reprobate is capable of, as well as the Children of God, which is ſo apparent as needs no proofe; only in the iſſue of their Tenet, the faith of them freeth a man from the conceit of being an abſolute Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:56120:150"/>
So that in effect it comes to this; Thou poore afflicted ſoul, be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, for if thou wilt hearken unto me, and imbrace thoſe ſolid grounds of comfort which I will reveale unto thee, aſſure thy ſelfe they ſhall be as the Balme of Gilead unto thy ſoule; whereby thou maiſt be confident, that albeit it may be thou art a Reprobate, and that God from everlaſting hath ordained thee unto damnation, that yet certainly thou art no abſolute Reprobate, no more then <hi>Cain,</hi> or <hi>Eſau, Saul,</hi> or <hi>Judas,</hi> or the Devills were; For theſe my principles will aſſure thee that there never was, nor is, nor ſhall be any abſolute Reprobate throughout the world.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. I come to the examining of them particularly, &amp; to ſhew that every one of them is as it were againſt the haire. So evident are the teſtimonies of Scripture againſt them all; and they are obtruded upon a ſuperficiary and moſt moſt unſound inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture in ſome places. For 1. as touching the firſt, <hi>the univerſality of Gods love;</hi> For hereby Gods love is made indifferent unto all, and conſequently towards <hi>Eſau</hi> as well as to <hi>Jacob,</hi> whereas the Scripture profeſſeth that <hi>God loved Jocob and hated Eſau;</hi> and this the Apoſtle makes equivalent to the Oracle dilivered to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bekah</hi> concerning them before they were borne. 2. He might as well have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it, of the univerſallity of Gods mercy; whereas the Scripture expreſſely diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth between <hi>veſſels of mercy &amp; veſſells of wrath.</hi> 3. This love is explicated by them to conſiſt in a will to ſave all. Now election is but Gods will to ſave; and the Scripture plainly teacheth, and it is confeſſed by all that I know (excepting <hi>Coelius Secundus</hi> to whom this Authour it ſeemes is moſt beholding for his ſtory of <hi>Spira)</hi> that though <hi>Many are called yet but few are choſen.</hi> And whereas it is confeſſed, that the moſt part of men are Reprobates, that is, from everlaſting willed unto condemnation; yet never the leſſe they beare us in hand that all men even <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> yea and (as I think) the Devills and all were willed by God unto Salvation. And that there is no contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all this. And every poore afflicted ſoule muſt believe hand over head that all this is true (what ſpecies of contradiction ſoever be found therein which this Authour from the begining of his diſcourſe to the end hath taken no paines to cleare) leaſt otherwiſe he forfaits all hopes of comfort, upon ſuch ſoveraine grounds as are here propoſed, by faith wherein aman may be as well aſſured of his Salvation and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from damnation, as any Reprobate in the World. For albeit he be a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and God ſhould reveale this unto him, yet upon theſe grounds he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that he is no abſolute Reprobate. 2. I come to the Second comfortable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and that is, the univerſality of Chriſts death, namely, that he died for all. Now this is oppoſite to Scripture evidence, as the former; yea and to Chriſtian reaſon, if not more: For albeit <hi>God ſo loved the World, even the whole World, that he gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son that whoſoever believes in him ſhould not periſh but have Life Everlaſting:</hi> which gives a fair light of expoſition to thoſe places where Chriſt is ſaid to have dyed for the ſins of the World, yea of the whole world, to wit, in this manner, that <hi>whoſoever believes in him ſhal not periſh but have everlaſting life.</hi> yet the Scripture ſpeaks as often of Chriſts death in a reſtrained ſenſe, as where it is ſaid <hi>Chriſt gave himſelfe a ranſome for many. And that his bloud was ſhed for his Apoſtles, and for many, for the remiſſion of their ſinnes. And that Chriſt ſhould ſave Gods people from their ſinnes. And that God hath purchaſed his Church with his bloud; And Chriſt gave himſelfe for his Church. And that he is ſaviour of his body; And that he dyed for the elect.</hi> And in the 17 of <hi>John,</hi> our Saviour would not pray for the World, but only for thoſe whom God had at that time given unto him; and who afterward ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him through their word; And look for whom he prayed with excluſion of the reſt <hi>for their ſakes he ſanctified himſelf:</hi> Now that this is ſpoken in reference to the offering of himſelfe up unto God, upon the croſſe, it was the joynt interpretation of all the Fathers whom <hi>Maldonate</hi> had read as he profeſſeth on that place, and there reckons up a multitude of them. Then againe, Chriſts death and paſſion (we know) was of a ſatisfactory nature; and therefore if he dyed for all, he ſatisfied for all the ſinnes of all men; why then are not all ſaved? Why is any damned? Is it juſt with God to torment with everlaſting fire, for thoſe ſinnes, for which he hath received ſatisfaction; and that a more ample one, then mans ſatisfaction can be, by ſuffering the torments of Hell fire? For therefore it ſhall never end, becauſe it ſhall never ſatisfie. Againe, how many millions were at that time dead and in hell fire; and did Chriſt ſatisfy for their ſinnes by his death upon the Croſſe, and they continue ſtill to be tormented? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the obedience of Chriſt in generall, is of a meritorious nature, even meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of everlaſting life; Now if Chriſt hath merited everlaſting life for all and every
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:56120:151"/>
one, how comes it that all and every one doe not enjoy Everlaſting Life? Shall not God the Father deale with his owne Sonne according to the exigency of his merits, whether it be that they are ſo meritorious in their owne nature; or by the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God; either meerely, or joyntly with the dignity of their nature, in reference to the dignity of the perſon who performed them, as being not only man but God, even the eternall Son of God one &amp; the ſame God with his Father, Bleſſed for ever. Now it can be made good that all ſins of all men are fully ſatisfied for, by the death of Chriſt, &amp; that Chriſt hath merited in better manner Everlaſting Life for all &amp; every one, then they could have done for themſelves, although they had paſſed the whole courſe of their lives, as free from ſinne as the very elect Angells; this I confeſſe is a comfortable doctrine with a witneſſe; though God leave men to themſelves and to the power of their owne free wills to doe what they liſt. And I ſee noe reaſon, but that in the midſt of all Ryot and exceſſe, they may be as confident of their Salvation, as if they had all faith; as of certaine Lutherans it is written, as I ſaw in a letter of an Engliſh Divine writen from Rome. I make no queſtion but their anſwer will be, that albeit Chriſt hath thus ſatisfied for all ſinnes of all and every one, and merited Eternall Life for all and every one, yet the benefit of his merits and ſatiſfaction by Gods Ordinance ſhall redound to none, but ſuch as believe, and repent, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere therein unto death. And what comfort can herehence ariſe to an afflicted ſoule, unleſſe ſhe doe believe and repent? If ſhe doe believe and repent, our Doctrine gives aſſurance to ſuch of their election, the Arminian doth not. Here I preſume they will ſay, that every one may believe if he will, repent if he will; and may they not as well ſay, that every ſoule afflicted with deſpaire, may leave of to deſpaire if they will, and conſequently leave of to be afflicted if they will? And I confeſſe this way of conſolation hath a very ſhort cut, if the afflicted ſoul would harken unto them. Eſpecially conſidering that I doe not find, that in theſe their diſcourſes they take any notice of any ſinne to hinder this, no not ſo much as of the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, or of that ſinne which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                                 <hi>John</hi> calleth a ſinne unto death. But I doe much doubt whether this were the manner of comfort which the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> thought himſelfe enabled for by Gods grace, when he ſayd, <hi>The Lord God hath given me the</hi> 
                                 <note place="margin">Eſ. 50. 4.</note> 
                                 <hi>tongue of the Learned, that I ſhould know how to ſpeake a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary: he wakeneth Morning by Morning, he wakeneth mine eare to heare as the learned.</hi> Wherefore let me make bold in behalfe of the Patient, to move unto you a queſtion: Doth not the Scripture teach us that faith is the gift of God, that repentance is the gift of God? <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 8. Phil. 1. 29.</note> 
                                 <hi>Act:</hi> 11. 18. 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 2. 25, How then is it poſſible for me to believe and repent, unleſſe God give me the grace of faith and repentance? I preſume you will anſwer, that God gives faith and repentance, firſt, in as much as he gives all men power to believe and repent, And ſecondly, in as much as he concurres with them to the act of faith and repentance in caſe they will. But I pray thee tell me, is not the will to repent alſo the gift of God? And if I have not as yet the will to repent, how is it poſſible I ſhould repent? Can any man repent without a will to repent? Is not repentance chiefly the charge of the will? But you will ſay (I ſuppoſe) that even this will to repent God is ready to worke in me, if I will repent. But in caſe a man will repent, what need hath he of any Divine aſſiſtance to cauſe in him this will to repent, ſeeing he hath it already? Laſtly, doth not God give a man a power to refuſe to believe, to refuſe to repent if he will? And is he not as ready to concurre with him to any ſinfull act if he will, and to worke the very will alſo of doing it in caſe he will? And are not theſe then the gifts of God as well as others? To conclude, what think you of the gift of faith, hath Chriſt merited it for us or no? It ſeemes by your Doctrine he hath not; as when you teach that albeit Chriſt hath ſatisfied for all, merited Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life for all; yet the benefit of Chriſt obedience and death, is by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God applyable to none, but ſuch as have faith: wherby it appears, that you do not make faith to be any of thoſe benefits, which redound unto us by the obedience of Chriſt. For though it be decent to ſay, that ſalvation as a benefit procured by Chriſts obedience, can redound to none but to ſuch as believe; yet it is very indecent to ſay, that faith it ſelfe, as a benefit of Chriſts death, ſhall by the ordinance of God redound to none but to ſuch as believe. And indeed the Remonſtrants now adaies, doe openly profeſſe, that Chriſt merited faith for none. And they are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>In Cenſura Cenſurae.</hi> p. 56.</note> for dealing ingenuouſly, and confeſſing that, whereunto the Genius of their Tenet doth carry them. Our Arminians deale not ſo plainly: but as they pretend
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:56120:151"/>
that faith and repentance are the gifts of God; ſo they pretend that Chriſt merited them for us, to wit, he merited univerſall grace for all and every one, whereby eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man may believe if he will, and repent if he will. And how comfortable this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular is, I have already ſhewed; for it is as much as to ſay, <hi>you may ceaſe to deſpaire if you will, you may ceaſe to be afflicted if you will.</hi> Secondly, Chriſt merited, that God ſhould concurre to the working of faith and repentance in them, provided that they would worke it in them ſelves. Yea the very will to believe and repent, God will worke in them <hi>modo velint.</hi> So that ſtill the reſolution of all comfort, is into a mans owne free-will; For God gives not faith and repentance to whom he will, or according to the meere pleaſure of his will, but rather according to mens workes. And this direct Pelagianiſme, condemned ſo many hundred years agoe, is that moſt comfortable doctrine of Chriſtianity, which our Arminians doe afford. And this diſcourſe as touching the univerſality of Chriſts death, may be applyed alſo to the univerſality of Gods love, which ends in this, that all men ſhall be ſaved if they doe believe; and that every man may believe if he will; and that God is ready to worke faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in them, provided that they will be as ready to worke it in themſelves.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. And now I come to this Authors third Topick place of conſolation, drawn from the univerſality of the Covenant of grace. Now this is as ſtrange as any of the former, or rather much more, and when the Covenant of grace is ſo much enlarged, we have cauſe to feare that it is confounded with the Covenant of Workes. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if it were true, as ſome of this ſect profeſſe, namely, that there is an univerſall grace given to al for the enlivening of their wills, wherby they are enabled to will any ſpirituall good whereunto they ſhall be excited; and to believe if they will, and from the love of temporall things to convert themſelves to the keeping of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements if they will; I ſee no reaſon but that the Law is able to give life, though the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth the contrary; and the way is as open unto man for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the workes of the Law as it was unto <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocency. And if the Covenant of grace be univerſall, and ever was, for that I take to be this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours meaning, then God was no more the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of his ſeed, then of all the World; nether was the people of Iſrael more the Lords portion then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation of the World: yet <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in their behalfe with this Meſſage; <hi>Thus ſayth the Lord, Iſraell is my ſonne, my firſt borne, wherefore I ſay unto thee, Let my ſonne goe that he may ſerve mee; if thou refuſe to let him goe, Behold I will ſlay thy ſonne even thy firſt borne Ex:</hi> 4. 22, 23. Thus God accounts them albeit they were miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly corrupted with Idolatry; as it appeares. <hi>Ez:</hi> 20. 6. <hi>In the day that I lift up my hand upon them, to bring them forth of the Land of Egypt;</hi> 7. <hi>Then ſayd I unto them, Let every one caſt a way the abominations of his eies, and defile not your ſelves with the Idolls of Egypt; for I am the Lord your God.</hi> 8. <hi>But they rebelled against me, and would not heare me; for none caſt away the abominations of their eyes; neither did they forſake the Idolls of Egypt:</hi> then I thought to <hi>poure out mine Indignation upon them and to accompliſh my wrath againſt them in the midst of the Land of Egypt;</hi> 9. <hi>But I had reſpect unto my name that it ſhould not be polluted of the Heathen.</hi> So he proceded in deſpite of their ſinnes, to carry them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and brought them into the wilderneſſe and gave them Statutes, and Judgments, and his Sabaths; v: 10, 11, 12. But they rebelled againſt him in the Wilderneſſe, whereupon he thought againe to poure out his indignation upon them in the Wilderneſſe <hi>to conſume them</hi> v. 13. <hi>But he had reſpect unto his name,</hi> v. 14. <hi>amd his eie ſpared them and would not deſtroy them</hi> v. 17. And againe, when their Children provoked him by rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, whereupon he thought of powring out his Indignation upon them v. 21. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſse he withdrew his hand, and had reſpect unto his name</hi> v. 22. Then as touching the generation of that preſent time he profeſſeth <hi>he will rule them with a mighty hand</hi> v. 33. And the iſſue thereof is no worſe then this, <hi>I will cauſe you to paſſe under the rod, and bring you into the bond of the Covenant</hi> v. 37, <hi>And againe, marke</hi> with what <hi>a gratious promiſe he concludes</hi> v. 43. <hi>There ſhall ye remember your wayes and all the workes wherein ye have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and ye ſhall judge yourſelves worthy to be caſt of for all your evills, which you have committed</hi> 44. <hi>And ye ſhall know that I am the Lord, when I have reſpect unto you for my names ſake and not after your wicked waies, nor according to your corrupt worke, O yee houſe of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> Here is the peculiar fruit of the Covenant of grace, to maſter their iniquities, to bring them unto repentance, and to deliver them, from the dominion of ſinne and Satan. If God performe this Grace to all and every one throughout the World, then is the Covenant of grace univerſall, and all and every one are under it, but if there be
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:56120:152"/>
few, very few, over whom ſinne hath not the dominion, then certainly very few are under the Covenant of grace. For the Apoſtle plainly ſignifyeth this, to be the fruit of the Covenant of grace; where he ſaith, <hi>Sinne ſhall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the Law but under grace, Rom:</hi> 6. 14. <hi>And the like</hi> we have, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8. <hi>I will make with the Houſe of Judah a new Testament.</hi> 9. <hi>Not like the Teſtament that I made with their fathers, in the day that I tooke them by the hands to lead them out of the Land of Egypt: For they continued not in my Teſtament, and I regarded them not, ſaith the Lord.</hi> 10. <hi>For this is the Testament that I will make with the Houſe of Iſraell, after thoſe dayes, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Lawes in their mind, and in their heart I will write them, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> 11. <hi>And they ſhall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother ſaying, Know the Lord: for all ſhall know me from the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them.</hi> 12. <hi>For I will be mercyfull unto their unrighteouſneſſe, and I will remember their ſinnes, and their iniquities no more.</hi> According to this Covnant proceed thoſe gratious promiſes, whereof the Scriptures are full. <hi>I have ſeen his wayes, and I will heale them.

For all theſe comforts ſo magnificently ſet forth, have no force, ſave in caſe a man believe them now, if a man believeth, our doctrine can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him of Everlaſting Life; and ſo of his election, which the Arminian cannot. For we teach that which our Saviour hath taught us, <hi>He that believeth in the Son hath Everlaſting Life;</hi> and he <hi>that obayeth not the Sonne ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth upon him:</hi> But as for the performing of faith, they leave that unto man, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Gods concurrence. And in like ſort for the maintenance of their faith, they teach a man to put his truſt in himſelf with Gods concurrence, as if otherwiſe a mans condition were uncomfortable, and the way were open to deſperation. But what doth <hi>Auſtin</hi> anſwer to ſuch like diſcourſes of old, <hi>de Predeſt: ſanct: cap:</hi> 22. <hi>An vero timendum eſt, ne nunc de ſe homo deſperet, quando ſpes ejus demonſtratur ponenda in Deo, non autem deſperaret ſi eam in ſe ipſo ſuperbiſſimus &amp; infeliciſſimus poneret?</hi> Is it to be feared, leaſt a man deſpaire, when it is proved, that a mans hope is to be placed in God, and that he is free from deſpaire, in caſe he place his hope in himſelfe, moſt proudly, and moſt unhappily?</p>

For without doubt it is to be underſtood in oppoſition to that which he formerly delivered, adviſing us to <hi>judge of the will of God by his expreſſe Word;</hi> and all one with <hi>ſeeking election extra verbum</hi> formerly ſpecified: of both which <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeakes more at large in that very place aleadged by this Author in the firſt Section of this laſt ſort of Arguments; And there <hi>Calvin</hi> commends the one as a moſt comfortable courſe, and ſets forth the danger of the other in farre more emphaticall manner then <hi>Melancthon</hi> doth, and therewithall diſcovereth the true Balme of Gilead, wherein it conſiſts, in the ſame manner that <hi>Melancthon</hi> doth, and more fully: but it ſerved not this Authors turne to repreſent <hi>Calvin</hi> thus diſcourſing, though he could not be ignorant there of, if himſelfe read the place, which he alleadgeth out of <hi>Calvin</hi> and tooke it not upon truſt at anothers hand. By the way I obſerve he makes the univerſality of the promiſe, mentioned by <hi>Melancthon,</hi> all one with the univerſality of the Covenant of grace mentioned by him. As if the Covenant of grace conſiſted only in this, <hi>Whoſoever believes ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and accordingly you may gueſſe of his meaning as touching the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of Chriſts death, namely, that the benefit thereof ſhall redound to all that believe; as good as in plaine termes to profeſſe, that Chriſt dyed not to procure and merit faith for us, which the Remonſtrants doe now adaies openly profeſſe; but I doe
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:56120:153"/>
not find that our Arminians hitherto dare to concurre with them therein. And in like manner the univerſality of Gods love is to be underſtood; namely, of willing ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to as many as believe, not of willing grace unto them, at leaſt not of any meaning to beſtow faith and repentance upon them. Yet not any will yet ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo ingenuous as to confeſſe in plain termes, that God gives not faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to any man, but leaves that to be wrought by the power of their wills, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that God hath enabled all men with a power to believe. And indeed if faith and repentance be a gift, and ſpeciall gift of God; it is ſtrange that God ſhould beſtow them upon us <hi>extra Chriſtum,</hi> not for Chriſt ſake; And whence it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that thoſe gratious promiſes <hi>of circumciſing our hearts, of ſanctifying us, of writing his law in our mind and inward parts, and his feare in our hearts; never to depart from him, of healing our wayes, our backslidings, our rebellions; of taking away the stony heart out of our bowels and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us a heart of fleſh; and cauſing us to walke in his ſtatutes, and keepe his judgements, and doe them,</hi> are nothing belonging to the Covenant of grace in this Authors judicious conſideration. And to conclude, if all men be under the Covenant of grace, what force or ſubſtance at all is there in that promiſe which God makes unto his people of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> namely, <hi>that he will cauſe them to paſſe under the rodde, and bring them unto the bond of the Covenant.</hi> As alſo in that <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 60. <hi>I will remember my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with thee in the dayes of thy youth, and I will confirme unto thee an everlasting Covenant.</hi> 61. <hi>Then ſhalt thou remember thy wayes and be aſhamed, when thou ſhalt receive thy ſiſters, both thy elder and thy younger and I will give them unto thee for Daughters, but not by thy Covenant.</hi> 62. <hi>And I will eſtabliſh my Covenant with thee, and thou ſhalt know that I am the Lord.</hi> I come to the conſideration of the reaſons <hi>why theſe grounds are (pretended to be) able to healpe in ſuch a caſe,</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe they are directly contradictory to the temptation; a will to ſave all, a givinig of Chriſt to death for all, and an offer of grace to all, cannot poſſibly ſtand with an abſolute anticedent will, and intent of casting a way the greateſt part of mankind, or indeed any one man in the world.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>To this I anſwer. 1. Though they be contradictory to the temptation, yet if they carry manifeſt evidence of notorious untruths in their foreheads, delivered as they are without explication, what true comfort ſhall an afflicted ſoule receive therehence, when by embracing them he ſhall but hould a lye in his right hand? For doe not theſe comforters themſelves acknowledge, that God hath from everlaſting decreed the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the greateſt part of men? Yet they would have a poore afflicted ſoule believe that notwithſtanding this he wills the ſalvation of all, even of them whom he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto wrath; it is the Apoſtles phraſe 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 9. To endeavour to perſwade them of this, what is it but to make a ſickly creature to feed on fire, or digeſt Iron, as if that could ever turne into good nouriſhment. In like ſort to perſwade him that Chriſt hath made ſatisfaction for all the ſins of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; merited ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for all &amp; every one; when, notwithſtanding Chriſts merits of their ſalvation, the greateſt part of the world ſhall not be ſaved; And notwithſtanding Chriſts ſatisfaction for their ſinne, they muſt be put to ſatisfy for them, &amp; that by ſuffering the torments of hell fire, &amp; that for ever. 2. Let theſe points be explicated, &amp; then no comfort at all will appeare therehence to an afflicted ſoule in ſome caſe; As for example, when they ſhall underſtand that Gods love tends only to the ſaving of them in caſe they believe, &amp; repent, &amp; mortify the deeds of the fleſh, &amp; perſevere in ſuch like gracious courſes unto death: alas what comfort is this to a ſick ſoule, when he feeles in himſelfe no power to believe, no power to repent, no power to any ſpirituall good, contrary wiſe prone to evill, either not taking delight in Gods Word, or nothing profiting by it; Will it ſuffice to out face them herein, &amp; tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they have power to believe if they will, to repent if they will to mortify the deeds of the fleſh if they will; to crucify the affections &amp; luſts if they will, yea to have victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over the world if they will, and to quench all the fiery darts of the Devill if they will? And withall that their wills are enlivened to will any of all theſe, yea to will all theſe, and any other ſpirituall good whereunto they ſhall be exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Whereas the Scripture teacheth us, that men are dead in ſinne, before the time of their effectuall calling; and that ſuch was the condition of the Epheſians, before the Goſpell was Preached to them, and they converted by it; and that till they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 1, 2, 3. 2 Tim. 2. laſt.</note> the Goſpell, all men are led captive by the Divell, to doe his will. 3. What poore comfort is this to perſwade a man, that he is no abſolute Reprobate; when upon the ſame grounds, namely, that the number of Reprobates is farre greater even an
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:56120:153"/>
hundred for one, then the number of Gods elect, he may ſtill be perplexed with doubts and feares, yea and with as ſtrong an apprehenſion that he is a Reprobate. And amongſt all the examples that I have lighted upon, of deſperation upon this ground, they have not proceeded according to this diſtinction of reprobats abſolute or not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, but ſimply upon an apprehenſion that they were Reprobates, &amp; that not upon the conſideration of the ſmall number of Gods elect, and the vaſt number of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, but upon the conſcience of ſome ſinne or other, which they conceived to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, a ſinne unto death, a ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and that particularly conſiſting in oppoſing Gods truth, or blaſpheming it, or making warre againſt it: which I would this Author might be pleaſed well to conſider before his feet be too much faſtned in the mire, and there be no getting out of it. His ſecond reaſon followeth. 2. <hi>Becauſe they convince the tempted that he cannot be in that condition in which he ſuppoſeth himſelfe to be, for two contradictoryes cannot be true.</hi> This is no new reaſon at all, but a meere application of the reaſon formerly delivered. But this Author conſiders not how he marres his owne courſe of conſolation, caſting his ſpirituall patient to believe hand over head things directly contradictory, as namely, that God wills the Salvation even of thoſe whom he hath from everlaſting ordayned unto damnation; and is not his patient like to take much comfort in this ſpeculation; namely, that albeit he be one of thoſe whom God hathordained to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, yet he wills his Salvation. What a poore comfort is it to conceive that though God will have him to be damned, yet not inevitably; whereas Gods will is as effectuall in bringing contingent things to paſſe contingently, as in bringing neceſſary things to paſſe neceſſarily: ſo raine to morrow is a contingent thing, yet God can bring it to paſſe as infallibly, though in a contingent manner, as he brings to paſſe the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the ſunne. What comfort to a poore afflicted ſoule, that though God wils his condemnation, yet not abſolutely but reſpectivly; (for theſe termes alone doe ſtand in proper oppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the judgment of Arminians) to wit, that he will not damne him but for his ſinne. As for the conſolation here miniſtred, <hi>that God would have all and every one</hi> (for unleſſe it proceed in that ſence it is nothing to the purpoſe,) <hi>to be ſaved, redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and called to repent and believe;</hi> this is full of colluſion: Firſt in mixing many things together of a different nature; For as for the two firſt, that will, they have to proceed meerly conditionally, to wit, in caſe they believe and repent; manifeſtly implying, that the divine gift of faith and repentance, is no benefit of Chriſts redemption, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe good things which Chriſt hath merited for us. Now as for the reſt he was aſhamed to profeſſe in the ſame Tenor, that God would have all to believe and repent <hi>but only called to believe and repent.</hi> But ſeeing it is apparent that all are not called, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume <hi>this calling</hi> is to be underſtood alſo not abſolutely but conditionally; Now the condition thereof certainly is not faith and repentance, but ſomewhat elſe, which he expreſſeth not. And is it not requiſite the patient which is to be raiſed and releeved ſhould be acquainted with this condition, which yet is no where mentioned (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) throughout this diſcourſe? But be it that God will have this poore ſoule to be ſaved and redeemed in caſe he believe and repent; Unleſſe God alſo willeth his faith and repentance, what doore of hope or conſolation is opened to the poore, ſoule yet dwelling in the valley of <hi>Achor?</hi> I wonder not a little what he meant to ſay only, <hi>God we will have all to be called, to believe and repent,</hi> and not to ſpeake home and ſay, <hi>God will have all to believe and repent</hi> For what? Doth he not indeed acknowledge faith &amp; repentance to be the gifts of God; and if he doth give them, did he not from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will to give them? will you give me leave to gueſſe at the miſtery of his meaning in this? Had he ſayd, <hi>God will have all to believe and repent,</hi> as he ſayeth, <hi>God will have all to be ſaved and redeemed;</hi> like as their meaning is well knowne as touching Gods will to ſave, namely, upon condition &amp; that condition alſo is well knowne to be faith and repentance: In like ſort had he ſayd <hi>God will have all to believe and repent,</hi> he ſaw belike this would have brought upon him more trouble then he would well brooke; to wit, by demanding whether God will have all to believe ond repent abſolutely or conditionally: Not abſolutely I preſume, leaſt ſo they ſhould grant election unto faith &amp; repentance to be abſolute; Therefore they muſt be driven to ſhew upon what condition God will have men to believe &amp; repent, that is, upon that condition God doth beſtow faith &amp; repentance upon men. Now they are very loath to come to this. But is it not fit that the ſoule which is to be comforted upon this ground ſhould be throughly acquainted with this condition? For it is a vain thing
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:56120:154"/>
to diſcourſe of a power in man to believe and repent, and to ſay it is given them by the grace of God, conſidering that the Scripture is not more pregnantly averſe from countenancing any ſuch power granted unto all; as it is cleare, it profeſſeth faith and repentance to be the gift of God, and conſequently no man can exerciſe that pretended power without a farther grace, whereby God gives faith it ſelfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance it ſelfe, and not only a power to believe, and a power to repent. Therefore it is very neceſſary for an afflicted ſoule, that is to be comforted upon this ground; to have this miſtery revealed unto her, namely, upon what condition God will give one faith and repentance. But this Author keepes himſelfe cloſe in this poynt, and budg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not for feare, belike of diſcovering ſome miſtery of iniquity on their part. But whiles he conceales this, doth he not play the part of a proper Mountebanke, when he pretends the ſelling of Balme, and ſoveraigne oyles, when indeed he meanes only to juggle and collude with his ſpectators? And there is good reaſon why he ſhould conceale this, or rather I doubt whether he that ſhewes himſelfe on the ſtage herein, is ſufficiently acquainted with the miſtery himſelfe; For whereas they cannot endure, that God ſhould abſolutely diſpenſe the grace of Faith and repentance to whom he will, but upon a condition to be performed on mans part: Hence it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly followes, that the grace of faith and repentance is collated by God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mens workes, which is plain Pelagianiſme, and condemned above 1200 years agoe, in the Synod of Paleſtine, and in no Orthodoxe Synod or Councell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed or retracted ever ſince. Another reaſon there is of this concealement, and that is to prevent the manifeſtation of the ſtrange abſurdity of their Tenet, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable by the light of nature; For the condition of Gods working faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in us, is this, <hi>modo nos velimus credere &amp; reſipiſcere;</hi> as much as to ſay, as many as will believe ſhall believe, which is as true of the moſt ſinfull act that is committed by man, that God gives it in the ſame manner. And more then this they dare not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that <gap reason="foreign">

                                 <hi>velle</hi> is the gift of God, but <hi>modo velimus,</hi> whereby it comes to paſſe, that the act of willing is the condition of it ſelfe, and conſequently, both before and after it ſelfe. And theſe ſhamefull iſſues doe juſtly befall them, becauſe they abhorre to profeſſe, that <hi>God cauſeth us to walke in his ſtatutes, and to keepe his judgements, and doe them.</hi> The courſe that <hi>Junius</hi> took to quiet her conſcience, who thought ſhe was damned for neglecting to goe to Maſſe, by proving unto her that the Maſſe was a meere wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip, was faire and reaſonable, but the courſe this Author takes to comfort an afflicted ſoule, I have ſhewed to be moſt unreaſonable. <hi>Abſolute reprobate</hi> hath a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſenſe, according as it is differently applyed, If applyed unto damnation, or the denyall of glory; we utterly deny that either the one is inflicted, or glory is denyed abſolutely, but meerely upon ſuppoſition of ſinne. But applyed to grace, we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly confeſſe, that God doth abſolutely give the grace of regeneration, the grace of faith and repentance, to whom he will, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul, He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth. Rom.</hi> 9. 18. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 30. Where to ſhew mercy, is apparently to bring men unto faith; neither can it have any other ſenſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. being ſet in oppoſition to hardening; and in reference to the objection riſing therehence, in the words following. Thou wilt ſay then, why doth he yet complaine, for who hath reſiſted his will: <hi>v.</hi> 19. And while this Author denies that faith and repentance are given according to the good pleaſure of Gods will, which is to give them abſolutely; he muſt be driven to confeſſe, that they are given conditionally: and if a man will take any comfort therehence, he muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the condition, which yet this Author, undertaking the office of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation upon this ground, doth from the firſt to the laſt conceale, as if he feared to diſcover the ſhamefull nakedneſſe of his cauſe, which I have adventured to diſplay, and whereof I deſire the indifferent reader would judge. So that indeed this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is a new ſnare rather, to entangle a poore ſoule in ſadneſſe and heavineſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable, fowler-like, then any true office of conſolation, where ſhe may eſcape as a bird, out of the firſt ſnare of the Fowler, by breaking it and delivering her.</p>
                              <p>Indeed theſe grounds of hope and comfort, <hi>a Miniſter cannot make uſe of, that holds ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Reprobation.</hi> What ſober man would expect he ſhould: but ſuch a one is never a whit the worſe comforter for that; For as for theſe grounds, I have already diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them, to be voyd of all truth, of all ſobriety. For if men be not abſolutely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated from the grace of faith and of repentance, but conditionally, (For as for the denying of glory, or inflicting damnation, we utterly deny that God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:56120:154"/>
that they ſhall have their courſe abſolutely according to the meere pleaſure of his will, having made a Law according whereunto he purpoſeth to proceed therein) it became this Author, performing the part of a Comforter on this ground, to make knowne the condition which he utterly declineth. And with all I have ſhewed the reaſons of his carriage thus in Hugger Mugger, to wit, that their ſhamefull Tenets might not breake forth, and be brought to light, We abhorre to ſay that God gives the grace of faith and repentance according to mens workes; Wee abhorre to ſay that God workes in men the act of believing and repenting, provided they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent; or that he workes in them the <gap reason="foreign">

                                 <hi>velle</hi> of every good worke <hi>modo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>velint.</hi> But our comſolations proceed, as I have ſhewed, in this manner, If any man man doth believe and repent, we can aſſure ſuch a one by our doctrine that he is an elect of God; this Arminians by their doctrine cannot, as who maintaine that a true believer may fall a way from grace and be damned; which is to hold the ſoules of the beſt children of God upon the rack of feares, and terrours, and tortures conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and make them walke as it were upon pinacles of the Temple; for they have no aſſurance of ſtedfaſtneſſe, but in their owne wills, to keepe them from dropping into Hell fire, which burneth under them. If men doe not believe and repent; we will enquire into the cauſe of their feares &amp; grounds of their apprehentions that they are Reprobates; and ſhew that they have no juſt cauſe for ſuch apprehenſions whether it be the conſcience of their ſinne; or want of faith that doth affright them; For as much as the holieſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> living before their calling, had as great cauſe to be affrighted as they; yet had they thereupon conceived themſelves to be Reprobates, this had been but an erronious conceit. If perhaps it be not the conſcience of ſinne in generall, that affrights them, but rather the conſcience of ſome ſinne in ſpeciall, which they conceive to be a ſinne unto death, or a ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which they conceive to be unpardonable; we will conferre with them thereabouts, and try whether they underſtand aright the nature of that ſinne, and endeavour to ſcatter thoſe miſts of illuſions in this particular, which Satan hath raiſed, deſiring to ſwallow them up in deſperation; if it doe not prove to be a ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, we will ſet them in a courſe to get the ſpirit of faith and of repentance. For albeit God alone can give them, yet ſeeing his Word is a Word of power, even a voyce that pearceth the graves; we willperſwade them to give themſelves to be wrought upon by Gods Word, and we will pray for them who yet want ſpirit to pray for themſelves. And albeit they cannot prepare themſelves in a gratious manner to the hearing of Gods Word, yet let them come; and when they are come let his Word worke; yet if forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we have not that comfortable experience of Gods goodneſſe towards us, let us not give over to wait at the lords gates, and to give attendance at the poſts of his doore. Give him leave to be the Maſter of his own times, let us not preſcribe unto him; We know his courſe is to call ſome at one houre of the day ſome at an other, and at the very laſt hour he calleth ſome. This is the way of conſolation that we take. We doe not take any ſuch courſe as this Author at his pleaſure obtrudes upon us, <hi>that God would have all to be ſaved, and that Chriſt died for all;</hi> I have allready ſet forth this Authors colluſions in his triple univerſality of Gods love, Chriſts death, and and of the Covenant of grace. We rather will exhort him to believe, and herein we will take ſuch courſe as God in his Word hath directed us unto; and we will pray unto God that his Word may be, <hi>as the raine that cometh downe, and the ſnow from Heaven &amp; returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth, &amp; bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So his Word may be that goeth out of his mouth, it may not returne unto him voyd, but accompliſh that which he will, and proper in the thing whereto he ſends it, And remove all vaine grounds of apprehenſions of terrible things againſt themſelves;</hi> What <hi>if a great many be reprobated from grace, and ſhall never have any part in Chriſt?</hi> it doth not follow that this afflicted ſoule is any of them; what one is there of the children of God which was not ſometimes dead in ſinne: and if pangs of childbirth goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the delivering of a child into the world of nature, why ſhould it ſeeme ſtrange that pangs of childbirth are ſuffered before a man be brought forth in to the world of grace? And theſe feares and terrours wherwith this poore ſoule is perplexed, may be unto her as pangs of childbirth, to bring her forth into a new world. We ſay that by Gods Word we are to conceive that ye are elected upon our faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; Thus <hi>Paul</hi> concluded the election of the Theſſalonians. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 3, 4. And 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13. Thus <hi>Melancthon</hi> would have us ſeeke it; but by the Arminian
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:56120:155"/>
doctrine it is in vaine to ſeeke after it, for as much as none can find it. We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Few are choſen,</hi> therefore we admoniſh every one, to <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtraight gate.</hi> This was our Saviours exhortation, delivered by way of anſwer to a queſtion made unto him by his Apoſtles, Whether there were but few that ſhould be ſaved. We teach that Chriſt hath died for the people of God, for the elect of God, for his Church, for his body, not only to make ſatisfaction for ſinne, and to procure ſalvation for them, in caſe they believe, but to procure alſo the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit for them to make them believe and repent, &amp;c. And this is wrought by the word, which is the ſword of the ſpirit. We take not the courſe he obtrudes upon us; We make no ſuch diſtinctions for the conſolation of the afflicted as he faignes: We deale plainly, and ſpare not to profeſſe, that albeit ſalvation is open to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and that by the ordinance of God; yet that no man is able of himſelfe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or repent, for as much as the Scripture teſtifies, that all are dead in ſinne in the ſtate of nature, and led captive by the Divell to doe his will; and that the very Law of God, doth ſtrengthen ſinne, ſuch being the courſe of mans corruption, that the more he is forbidden this or that, the more it provokes him to tranſgreſſe, taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by the law to work in mans heart all manner of concupiſcence; this is our courſe, to beat downe the pride of man, and beat out of him all conceit of ability to doe any good, as of himſelfe; and ſo to caſt him downe at the feet of Gods mercy. Yet God is able by his grace to quicken him; and being brought up in the Church of God, wherein is the balme of Gilead able to heale our waies be they never ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and that that is adminiſtred, not according to the vile workes of men, (as if they had, any power to prepare them for the participation of Gods grace,) but of the meere favour and good pleaſure of God, <hi>Who calleth</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9.) <hi>with an holy calling, not according to our own workes, but according to his own purpoſe and grace;</hi> And that for the merits of Chriſt, who hath merited not only pardon of ſinne and ſalvation for all that believe, but faith alſo, and regeneration for all his elect; and being as we are members of Gods Church, we have no cauſe to deſpaire, but ſooner or later God may call us as continually he doth ſome or other, and we know not how ſoone our turne may come. And as for Gods purpoſe touching the performance of the condition of faith; we plainly profeſſe, That God purpoſed to give faith and repentance only to his elect, according to that, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48. <hi>As many believed, as were ordained to everlaſting life;</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 2. laſt. <hi>God added daily to his Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi> Now heare I pray their doctrine on the other ſide, which ſet out our manner of conſolation, deviſed moſt ridiculouſly at their own pleaſure, ſo to expoſe our doctrine to ſcorne. Doth God purpoſe to beſtow faith and repentance upon any other beſides his elect? This they muſt avouch if they contradict us, and that he purpoſeth to beſtow it on all and every one; but how? Not abſolutely on any, that is, not according to the meere pleaſure of his will; how then? Surely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, to wit, according to mens workes; that ſo not Semi-Pelagianiſme only, but plain Pelagianiſme may be commended unto Gods Church for true Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme. And what is that worke in man, whereupon God workes faith or repentance in them? Surely the will to believe, the will to repent. So that if all men will believe, will repent, then in good time through Gods grace they ſhall believe, they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; and if this be not to crowne Gods grace with a crowne of ſcornes, as Chriſt himſelfe was crowned with a Crowne of Thornes, I willingly profeſſe I know not what it is. We utterly deny that God hath two wills, one contrary to the other. We acknowledge that in Scripture phraſe Gods commandement is called his will, as, <hi>This is the will of God even your ſanctification,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 3. But this is not that will of God which the Apoſtle ſpeakes of, when he ſaith, <hi>Who hath reſisted his will, Rom.</hi> 9. 19, For his will of commandement is reſiſted too oft. But the will he ſpeaketh off, there is the will of Gods purpoſe and decree, whereof the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeakes, ſaying, <hi>Whatſoever the Lord will that hath he done both in Heaven and earth.</hi> Now ſuppoſe God command <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice his ſonne <hi>Iſaack,</hi> and yet decrees that <hi>Iſaack</hi> ſhall not be ſacrificed, both which are as true, as the word of God is true, yet there is no contradiction. For as much as his commandement ſignifies only Gods will, what ſhall be <hi>Abrahams</hi> duty to doe, not what ſhall be done by <hi>Abraham;</hi> On the other ſide Gods decree ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies what ſhall not be done by <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now what contradiction I pray is there betweene theſe, It is Gods <hi>will that it ſhall be Abrahams duty to ſacrifice Iſaack,</hi> but it is not Gods will that <hi>Iſaack</hi> ſhall be ſacrificed by <hi>Abraham;</hi> for as much as when <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

comes to the poynt of ſacrificing <hi>Iſaack,</hi> the Lord purpoſeth to hold his hand.

                                 </gap> eſt, that God decreed that Iſrael ſhould not be diſmiſſed by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for a while, and that (as is ſignified in the Text) to make way for his judgements to be brought upon the land of Egypt, whereby God meant to glorify himſelfe, as in the ſight of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and of his Egyptians, ſo in the ſight of the children of Iſrael, and of the bordering Nations; No contradiction at all in this, no more then Gods word is found to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it ſelfe. And nothing but ignorance makes our adverſaries ſo bold as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute contradiction to us in this. We grant willingly that God did intend that moſt ſhould never believe and repent; For as much as he intended to deny the gift of faith and repentance unto moſt, as it is apparent he doth; neither dares any Arminian deny it. Only they feigne, that God would give faith and repentance unto all, in caſe they would prepare themſelves; which not only includes manifeſt Pelagianiſme, but over and above ends in non-ſenſe, as I have but erſt, and often times before, made as cleare as the Sunne. Gods eternall rejection of many thouſands, which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be avoided, (for how is it poſſible, that what was from everlaſting, ſhould be avoyded by man or Angell, who are brought forth in time, not to have been from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting?) though it be all one with the anſwers of the tempted, and is contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to the comforts, which this Author deviſeth out of his own braine, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth too in a moſt colluding manner, as before I have ſhewed; and withall not ſo well ſorting with the manner of comforts which he feignes, and at meere pleaſure obtrudes upon us, (which yet he cannot evacuate without betraying the ſhamefull na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of his cauſe, when denying God to beſtow the gift of faith and repentance abſolutely on whom he will, and according to the meere pleaſure of his will, he is driven to manifeſt how he takes ſanctuary in Pelagianiſme, maintaining the grace of faith and repentance, to be conferred by God on men according to their workes; and that in a moſt unſober manner, as I have ſhewed at large;) yet notwithſtanding is this eternall decree of God concerning the rejection of man, nothing contrariant to better grounds of conſolation miniſtred by our doctrine, then any can be miniſtred by Arminians: as who doe not ſo much as undertake to miniſter better comfort to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, then ſuch as is common to them with Reprobates. But as for all thoſe that are brought up in the Church of God, who we can aſſure them that there is no cauſe (excepting guilt of that ſinne which is unto death, or which is againſt the Holy-Ghoſt) why any of them ſhould conceive themſelves to be Reprobates; nay the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of conſcience being the moſt ordinary meanes, whereby God doth prepare men for a comfortable tranſlation out of the ſtate of nature, into the ſtate of grace; they have cauſe to conceive comfort in this, that theſe feares and terrours may be as pangs of child-birth, to deliver their ſouls into the world of the ſons of God; and this vally of Achor, a doore of hope; &amp; this Bethany (a houſe of ſorrow or mourning) the high-way unto the viſion of Peace; as Bethany was commonly taken by our Saviour in his way unto Jeruſalem. For concluſion, we have heard a ſtrange cracking of thornes in this, but all proves but a ſquibbe; their beſt light of conſolation, goes out in an unſavoury ſnuffe of Pelagianiſme. Let us remember, though Thunder, and Earth-quakes, and Lightning, have their courſe in the vaine imaginations of men, yet God is ſtill and ever will be, in the ſmall voyce of his word. Let us give Gods <hi>truth,</hi> the glory of our conſolation; As for Errour, and that dangerous errour in defacing the glory of Gods grace, let us never ſeeke any comfort therein, and let them that love it, take what comfort in it they can; I doe not envy them, but rather pitty them; I would their hearts ſerved them to have compaſſion upon them ſelves.</p>

                           <p>SEcondly, it leaves a Miniſter weake grounds only, and inſufficient to quiet the tempted, and therefore it makes him unable to comfort. His grounds that are left him are inſufficient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot convince, and make it evident to the underſtanding of the tempted, that he is not that which he feares <hi>(i. e.)</hi> a Reprobate: out of temptation probabilities will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a mans hopes, (as they did <hi>Manoahs</hi> wife: <hi>Judg.</hi> 13. 22, 23. If the Lord would kill us he would not have received a burnt offering at our hands, nor ſhewed us all theſe things;) becauſe men are not ſo miſtruſtfull then: but in temptation men are very ſuſpitious and incredulous, like <hi>Jacob,</hi> who would not be perſwaded that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was alive, and a great man in Egypt, till he ſaw the Chariots that were ſent to fetch him thither, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 25. And like <hi>Thomas,</hi> who would not believe that Chriſt was riſen till he ſaw the print of the nailes and ſpeare. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 25. They will not believe any thing that is ſaid for their comfort, till it be made ſo apparent, that they have nothing to ſay to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. My ſelfe have known ſome, who in their temptations have often put their comforters to their proofes, to their proteſtations, nay to their oathes too, before they would believe their words of comfort. And in this temptation, men are ſo ſtrongly poſſeſt with a feare of the greateſt evill in the World, eternall rejection from God, that they will not eaſily, without manifeſt conviction, believe the contrary. But ſuch grounds as theſe, a Miniſter that holds abſolute reprobation hath not, he can ſay nothing that is able to make it appeare infallibly, and unavoydably to the tempted, that he is no abſolute reprobate.</p>
                           <p>All that he can ſay is, Be of good comfort, you are a believer, you are a true repenting ſinner; therefore no reprobate; for faith and repentance are fruits of election, and arguments of a ſtate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which you feare. But this the tempted will deny, he will ſay that he is no believer, &amp;c. And how will the Miniſter convince him that he is? He muſt prove to him by the outward acts of faith and repentance, (for they are only apparent to him,) that he doth repent and believe, but this proofe is not demonſtrative, doth not convince him, becauſe <hi>opera virtutum ſimulari poſſunt,</hi> the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall acts of ſaith, repentance or any other grace, may be counterfeited; The Devill may ſeeme to be an Angell of light, Wolves may goe in Sheepes cloathing; <hi>Judas</hi> may make the World believe by his Preaching and following Chriſt, that he is a true Apoſtle; And <hi>Simon Magus</hi> (though he remaine in the gall of bitterneſſe, and bond of iniquity,) may be thought by his receiving of Baptiſme, to be a true believer; And ſo may any Hypocrite by ſome exterior act, of faith and repentance, coſen the beſt diſcerner of ſpirits among men, and gaine the opinion and eſteeme of a true penitent and believer. Actions externally good or good in appearance, may be evill indeed for want of a good rule, a good manner, a good end, &amp; ſome other good circumſtances, with which an action which is good muſt be cloathed <hi>[For bonum non oritur niſi ex integris.]</hi> and ſo by conſequence cannot certainly prove the man that doth them to be a good man, or to have the grace of faith, repentance, or any other, truly planted in his heart.</p>
                           <p>Which being ſo (I ſay) that the Miniſter cannot, by the eternall acts and fruits of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which he ſeeth come from him, make it evident to the tempted (for the ſilencing of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies) that he is (without doubt) a true believer, and a true repentant, and conſequently no repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. For ſtill the tempted may ſay, You may be deceived in me, for you can ſee not a whit more in me, then hath been ſeen in many a Reprobate; If this be all you can ſay to prove me to be none, I am not ſatisfied, I may be a Reprobate, nay I am a Reprobate, and you are but a miſerable comforter, a Phyſitian of no value.</p>
                           <p>This that I ſay <hi>Piſeator</hi> doth ingeniouſly confeſſe, where he ſaith, that no comfort can poſſibly be <note place="margin">

That the elect in this caſe may be comforted, but it muſt be this way, <hi>viz.</hi> by their feeling of the burthen of ſinne, and their deſire to be freed from it by Chriſt; which proofs (as I have ſaid) are but only probable not infallible arguments of a mans election, and therefore unſufficient comforts.</p>
                           <p>And in the end of the ſame Theſis, where he ſaith, That a man ſhould reaſon thus with himſelfe, Grace is offered to ſome, with a mind of communicating it to them, therefore it may be that I am in that number; he implyes that the doctrine of abſolute Reprobation, which teacheth this communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace to ſome few only, affords but [a <hi>fieri poteſt]</hi> a peradventure I am elected, for a poore ſoule to comfort himſelfe withall.</p>

                              <p>IN the laſt place we are to conſider how truly he affirmeth that our doctrine leaveth a Miniſter none but weake grounds, and thoſe inſufficient to quiet the tempted.</p>
                              <p>And whereas he ſaith <hi>We cannot conceive, and make it evident to the underſtanding of the tempted that he is not (that which he feares) a Reprobate;</hi> we willingly acknowledge it. For not to be a reprobate is to be an elect. Now how can any Arminian convince and make it evident to the underſtanding (I doe not ſay of the tempted, but) of one that is a believer, and walkes on comfortablely in the wayes of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; is he (I ſay) <hi>able to convince ſuch a one,</hi> and make it evident unto him that <hi>he is one of Gods elect?</hi> I doe not think they dare profeſſe that they preſume they can; or make it evident to their owne underſtanding, that themſelves are of the number of Gods elect. How unreaſonable then is this courſe, to require of us to convince a man, that acknowledgeth neither faith nor repentance in him, (for this is the condition of a man tempted, as himſelfe faſhioneth it;) <hi>and to make it evident to his underſtanding that he is an elect and no reprobate;</hi> when himſelfe cannot convict him that believeth of this; no nor their owne conſciences neither, notwithſtanding all their confidence, that they alone are in the right way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Was there ever heard a more unreaſonable courſe then this? Againe, <hi>to feare to be a reprobate, or leaſt he be a Reprobate,</hi> is one thing, to perſwade himſelfe that he is a Reprobate, and to deſpaire thereupon, is another thing. We ſay, and that according to our Doctrine, that there is no cauſe why any man (who hath not ſinned the ſinne unto death, the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt) ſhould perſwade himſelfe that he is a Reprobate and deſpaire thereupon; we doe not ſay there is no cauſe of feare. In as much as he hath no evidence of his election, there is juſt cauſe to feare; but then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, ſeeing he neither hath nor can have any evidence of his reprobation (excepting the guilt of the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt) he hath every way as good cauſe to hope. And for the comforting of ſuch a one, I would make bold to tell him that there is more hope of ſuch a one as himſelfe, then of thoſe who goe on <hi>in the wayes of their owne heart, and in the light of their owne eyes</hi> without all remorſe and check of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, without feare or wit, not conſidering that for all theſe things God will bring them to judgment. And towards ſuch I would think it fit to uſe all meanes and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to make them feare. The Apoſtle ſeemes to me to take the like courſe with better men then ſuch, even with ſuch as went on in a faire and comfortable profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Goſpell; namely to make them feare and ſuſpect themſelves, as when he ſaith, <hi>Prove youre ſelves whether you are in the faith, examine your ſelves. Know ye not that Christ is in you except ye be Reprobates.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. And for good reaſon; for as <hi>Paul</hi> was jealous over the Corinthians with a Godly jealouſy, <hi>for feare, leaſt as the Serpent beguilde Eve through his ſubtilty, ſo their minds ſhould be corrupt from that ſimplicity which is in Chriſt.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2, 3. And in like manner entertained feare, leaſt when he came <hi>he ſhould not find them ſuch as he would, and that he ſhould be found unto them ſuch as they would not &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. In like manner I ſhould think it is good for a man to be jealous over himſelfe with a godly jealouſy, leaſt their minds ſhould be corrupt, their wayes corrupt, more then they are a ware of, and there upon give themſelves to the examining of themſelves and <hi>to the ſearching and trying of their wayes</hi> whereunto the Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:56120:157"/>
exhorts us, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 40. And there is good comfort to be taken in ſuch a jealouſy, ſuch a feare, ſuch a courſe; For we find that the ſpirit of bondage making us to feare, is the forerunner of <hi>the ſpirit of adoption,</hi> whereby we cry <hi>Abba Father, Rom.</hi> 8. 15. Certainely they are in better caſe, and nearer to the Kingdome of God, then ſuch as feare not, yet is their no cauſe of deſpaire, for as much as the elect of God had no evidence of their election before their calling; Nay, after their calling they may be much afflicted with the feares and terrours of God, thinking themſelves to be in worſe caſe, then indeed they are. <hi>David</hi> found cauſe to pray that God would reſtore him to the joy of his Salvation; yet <hi>Bertius</hi> would not ſay that <hi>David</hi> was fallen from grace, and that <hi>propter graves cauſas;</hi> yet who hath written more eagarly to maintaine that Saints may fall away from grace then <hi>Bertius?</hi> But this Author beares before him ſuch a ſpirit of confidence, as if he would have all men ordered by his rules. When <hi>Manoahs</hi> Wife, <hi>Judg.</hi> 13. 22, 23. diſcourſeth thus, <hi>If the Lord would kill us he would not have received a burnt offering at our hands, nor ſhewed us theſe things;</hi> He doth obtrude upon us that <hi>Manoahs</hi> Wife had no faith, but only a probability of this; that is his gloſſe; yet this acceptation of a burnt offering at their hands was manifeſted by no leſſe then a miracle; and the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Abels</hi> offering and <hi>Caines</hi> offering is laid downe to be this, that <hi>The Lord had reſpect to Abel, and to his offering; but unto Cain and to his offering he had no regard. Gen.</hi> 4. 4, 5. And <hi>Davids</hi> prayer for acceptation, and finding favour at the hands of God is ſet downe in this manner, amongſt other particulars, <hi>Let him remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber all thine offerings, and turne thy burnt offerings into aſhes, Pſal,</hi> 20. 3. Yet why ſhould he conceive that <hi>Manoah</hi> and his Wife were not in temptation, and that a very ſore one, ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthened with the expres word of God, namely, that <hi>No man can ſee God &amp; live;</hi> which in theſe days was generally received amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; applyed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this particular. For <hi>Manoah</hi> ſaid unto his Wife, we ſhall ſurely dye becauſe we have ſeen God; &amp; could a probability to the contrary put by ſuch a temptation as this? How was the great Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> exerciſed with this when he cryed out, <hi>Woe is me, for I am undone, becauſe</hi>

                                 <hi>I am a man of polluted lipps, and dwell in the midſt of a people of polluted lipps, for mine eyes have ſeen the King and Lord of Hoſts.</hi> What temptation hath he that thinkes himſelfe a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate like unto this, excepting ſtill the guilte of that ſinne which is unto death? What ground of Scripture can they repreſent to prove that they are reprobates; as thoſe Ancients had ground for this, <hi>that they muſt dye who had ſeen God?</hi> It is one thing to be in temptation, it is an other thing to yeeld to the temptation, and to be overcome with it; and that upon no ground, which yet this Author confounds, as a courſe very propitious for his turne, and ſuitable with the part that he acteth. As for <hi>Jacob,</hi> the cauſe was this, he that now enjoyed as it were, the death of <hi>Joſeph</hi> for many yeares; his ſonnes pretending they knew not what became of him; yet brought his Coat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued with bloud unto their old Father, who there upon conceived ſome evill beaſt had devoured him; and who could expect that at the firſt hearing he ſhould believe now the report of the ſame ſonnes to the contrary; eſpecially conſidering how thoſe brethren of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> were aſtoniſhed when <hi>Joſeph</hi> himſelfe told them, ſaying, <hi>I am Joſeph, doth my father yet live?</hi> for the text ſaith, <hi>his brethren could not anſwer him, for they were astoniſhed</hi>

And may they not alſo reſiſt the Divells temptations if they will? Eſpecially conſidering that in perſwading them that they are Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates the Divell proceeds upon no ground, which is not common to every one of Gods elect, when he ſaith <hi>They will not believe any thing that is ſaid for their comfort, till it be made ſo apparent that they have nothing to ſay to the contrary.</hi> It ſeemes this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath had ſome extraordinary experience of the condition of perſons tempted,

I had thought the condition of perſons (not tempted only, but) giving way to the temptation, had been for the moſt part unreaſonable, untill it pleaſeth God to bring them to their right wits: and like as feares property is to betray the ſuccours that reaſon offereth; ſo is the Devills practice to take them off from attending that to they cannot anſwer, and holding them to their uncomfortable concluſions, in deſpight of the weakneſſe of their own premiſes and ſtrength of contrary princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; Excepting the caſe of finning againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which was the caſe of <hi>Francis Sptra,</hi> and accordingly his concluſions were moſt true as his premiſes ſtrong; and his comforters had little or nothing to ſay to the contrary. And in ſuch a caſe the only courſe to quench the fiery darts of deſperation, is to enquire diligently about the matter of fact, whether he hath committed any ſuch ſinne as he layeth to his charge; and thereupon to diſcourſe of the nature of that ſinne, which is commonly called a ſinne unto death, and not only ſo, but a ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which our Saviour pronounceth to be unpardonable; and the Apoſtle ſignifieth as much, when he ſaith that in ſuch a caſe, <hi>there is no more ſacrifice for ſinne, but a fearfull expectation of fire.</hi> And it may be, this Authors diſcourſe, runneth with reference to ſuch exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as this of <hi>Spira,</hi> but faſhioned at pleaſure to ſerve his turne, as formerly he did ſet down the ſtory out of <hi>Coelius Secundus</hi> &amp; <hi>Calvin</hi> as he ſaid, but without any quotation of the place where. But to enter upon a compariſon between their doctrine and ours, and that upon ſuppoſition of this rule delivered by him. I ſay firſt, that by our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, we can make it ſo evidently appeare, that the tempted hath no ground at all to conceive himſelfe to be a reprobate, whatſoever his condition be, (except guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt) I ſay we can make it ſo evident, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, nor any Arminian, can ſay any reaſonable thing to the contrary; not deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that they may ſay enough to the contrary in an unreaſonable manner. And my reaſon is, becauſe whatſoever his condition be, it is no other then is incident to one of Gods elect. Secondly, I ſay, as touching the Arminian doctrine, two things; The firſt is this, There is no condition of man ſo holy in this life, as whereby any man can have any aſſurance, by Arminian doctrine, that he is an elect of God, and conſequently no reprobate, much leſſe can they give any aſſurance to any man in the time of temptation (as this Author ſpeakes of it) that he is no reprobate. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is this, Arminians can give aſſurance to no man that he is no reprobate; for as much as all their grounds of comfort are common to the reprobate as well as to the elect: wherehence it manifeſtly followeth, that their doctrine can afford no better comfort then a reprobate is capable of. For their grounds are univerſall as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that is common to all, to wit, as touching the love of God, that it is common to all; as touching the death of Chriſt, that he dyed for all; as touching the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, that it alſo is common to all. And if this will comfort any man, namely, to be aſſured, that he is in as good a caſe as any Turke or Saracen, or any reprobate in the World, I find this Author is ready to aſſure them hereof, and rather then faile he will ſweare it, though I never heard matter of faith put to be tryed by mans Oath till now: I had thought only matters of fact, had been tryable and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable by Oath, not matter of faith. Yet I will not ſpare to profeſſe, that though they ſhould ſweare either of theſe univerſalities to be true, I would no more believe them then I would believe the Divell. For the Apoſtle adviſeth, ſaying, Though <hi>that wee or an Angell from Heaven Preach unto you otherwiſe then that which we have Preached unto you, let him be accurſed. Gal</hi> 1. 8. But let us examine the comfortable nature of theſe univerſalities, whether they be ſuch as a ſober man can ſay nothing to the contrary. I begin with the univerſality of Gods love; the comfort herehence proceeds thus, as I conceive; God loves all, willes all to be ſaved, therefore thou art no reprobate. Now conſider whether I may not ſoberly ſay to the contrary, that by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there is no reprobate in the World, or ever was; whence it followes, that I have no more comfortable aſſurance that I am no reprobate, then I have aſſurance that there is no Reprobate at all in the World. Secondly, would you have mee believe hand over head, that God would have all to be ſaved without diſtinction; may not I ſoberly inquire, whether your meaning be, that God will have all and every one to be ſaved, whether they believe or no, whether they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent or no; or only thus, That God will have all to be ſaved in caſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent, not otherwiſe. Now this is our doctrine, as well as yours, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:56120:158"/>
upon this Scripture, Whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved. Now doth this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine aſſure any man that he is no Reprobate, nor of the number of thoſe whom God hath rejected from ſalvation? Perhaps you will ſay, it is ſufficient to aſſure him, that he is no abſolute reprobate, and that ſo this Author is to be underſtood, though hitherto in this Section he delivered it ſimply. Admit this, Now judge I pray you, whether I may ſoberly oppoſe againſt it thus; Although I am no abſolute reprobate, yet if I am a reprobate, and may be as much aſſured of it, as that there is any repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in the World, what comfort can ariſe to my poore afflicted ſoule from hence. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine conſider, that neither we who oppoſe Arminians, doe maintaine that God hath ordained to deny any man ſalvation abſolutely, but only conditionally, to wit, in caſe he dye in ſinne without faith, without repentance. But ſuppoſe I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that God hath rejected mee from the grace of faith and of repentance, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort can you Arminians adminiſter to my ſick ſoule in this caſe? For dare you deny faith and repentance to be a gift of God? So then if I conceive my ſelfe to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate from grace, will you comfort me by ſaying, that I am no abſolute reprobate from grace? Then belike God hath determined to give or deny grace, not according to the meere pleaſure of his will, but according to mens workes; And have you no better balme of Gilead to adminiſter to a ſick ſoule, then to take ſanctuary in ſuch a Doctrine as is direct and flat Pelagianiſme? In the ſame ſober manner we ſhall have ſomewhat to ſay againſt that comfort that is reached forth to an afflicted ſoule, from the univerſality of Chriſts death; Thou doubteſt thou art a reprobate, but be of good cheere, for Chriſt dyed for all and every one; as much as to ſay, thou haſt no more cauſe to believe that thou art a reprobate, then to believe that there is any reprobate in the world. Secondly, be of good cheere, for albeit thou art a reprobate, and God foreſeeing thou wilt dye in ſinne, hath from everlaſting ordained thee to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well a <hi>Judas</hi> that betrayed Chriſt; yet I can aſſure thee, thou art no abſolute reprobate no more then <hi>Judas</hi> was. And whereas it may be thou art verily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he that believes and repents, and perſeveres herein, ſhall not be damned, for as much as all confeſſe, that God hath not ordained that damnation ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted abſolutely, according to the meere pleaſure of God, but meerely according to mens workes; but all thy feare is, leaſt thou art reprobated from grace, and that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely; conſidering that God (as it ſeemes) in the giving and denying of grace proceeds meerely according to the meere pleaſure of his will, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth. Rom.</hi> 9. 18. Yet be of good cheere, for I can aſſure thee, that is nothing ſo; but as there are no abſolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates from glory, and unto damnation, ſo there are no abſolute reprobates from grace, but meerely conditionally it is that men are reprobated from grace, like as meerely conditionally God doth elect men unto grace: And to ſpeake in plaine termes without diſſimulation; God gives faith and repentance unto men, according as they diſpoſe themſelves thereunto, for want of which diſpoſition, he denyes it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others. And if thou deſireſt to be more particularly informed in this miſtery for thine unſpeakable conſolation; know for certain, that if thou wilt believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, thou ſhalt believe and repent. And albeit in the Synod of <hi>Paleſtine, anno</hi> 415. it was concluded, <hi>That grace is not given according unto merits,</hi> and <hi>Pelagius</hi> was driven to ſubſcribe thereto, for feare of excommunication too, in caſe he had refuſed it; yet take this comfortable myſtery along with thee; that this was but a fruit of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinarian Hereſy; which that very yeare if thou markeſt the ſtory well, had his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, and was brought forth into the World. And laſtly, as touching the univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Covenant of grace, that is as comfortable as the former; for all are under it, and therefore thou amongſt the reſt, and conſequently thou art no more a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate then any other; certainly no abſolute reprobate, for there are none ſuch; <hi>Iudas</hi> was not, and therefore thou maiſt aſſure thy ſelfe thou art not. And indeed there are none that maintaine, that God decreed, that any man ſhould be denyed glory or damned abſolutely, but only conditionally, to wit, in caſe he finally perſevere in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity or impenitency: And whereas thou maiſt feare leaſt thou art abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated from grace, to wit, from the grace of faith and repentance; take heart and feare no colours. For albeit it be fit to confeſſe, conſidering the times that faith and repentance are the gifts of God, yet know that God doth not diſpenſe them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meere pleaſure of his will, but according to mens workes, whatſoever ſome men cry out to the contrary, charging us with Pelagianiſme; but if thou art
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:56120:158"/>
wiſe thou wilt take comfort in this, as in true Chriſtianiſme. As for thoſe that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine abſolute reprobation, none of them is able to make it appeare unto thee, that thou art no abſolute reprobate. And I willingly confeſſe, that if faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be not evidences hereof, we are not able to make it appeare, either to others that they are not, or to our ſelves that we are not Reprobates. But by the way it is manifeſt, that this Author by his grounds, can give no aſſurance of election, no not to a believer no certainty of ſalvation; and yet he pretends to be a comforter, when he leaves him in doubt whether he ſhall be ſaved or damned; yet upon this pillow Arminians ſleepe ſweetly, and preſume that others may ſleepe ſweetly alſo, that they are not abſolutely reprobates; And no marvaile; for even in the courſe of the holieſt converſation, their doctrine can adminiſter no aſſurance either of election or ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But perhaps they will ſay, though they can give no aſſurance of election abſolute by their doctrine, yet they can give aſſurance of election conditionall. But wherein I pray doth this conſiſt? Forſooth in this, that if they finally perſevere in this their holy converſation, they ſhall be ſaved. But I pray conſider, Doth not our doctrine afford the ſame aſſurance as well as theirs? It cannot be denied, but that it doth, and more then ſo; for our doctrine gives aſſurance of perſeverance in the ſtate of grace, to them that are once in the ſtate of grace; the Arminian doth not. And the Apoſtle aſſures the Theſſalonians, that upon his knowledge they were the elect of God, and that <hi>from the worke of their faith, the labour of their love, and the patience of their hope.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 3. 4. And that the man of ſinne ſhall not prevaile over them. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13. Becauſe they are elect; whereof alſo he was aſſured (as there he ſignifies) by their ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and faith.</p>
                              <p>It is true <hi>the outward acts of faith and repentance may be counterfited:</hi> And it is as true, that whether they be counterfeited or no, it may be diſcerned; otherwiſe why ſhould the Apoſtle be ſo bold as to profeſſe, and that by obſervation of their workes, <hi>that he knew they were elect of God.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 1. 4. The Devill may tranſforme himſelfe into an Angell of light, but yet we have a ſure Word of God, whereby to diſcerne his practiſes to corrupt either our faith, or our manners, otherwiſe we poore Creatures were but in a very evill caſe: ſo his Miniſters alſo transforme themſelves, crafty workers as they are, into Miniſters of righteouſneſſe; but S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                                 <hi>Paul</hi> diſcovered them and warned the Corinthians of them; Wolves may goe in ſheepes clothing, but our Saviour aſſures us that we ſhall know them by their fruites; none more proper fruite of a falſe Prophet then his falſe doctrine; And we have a true touch-ſtone to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that, and make the Devills clawes to appeare in their proper forme and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. And we know how ſoone <hi>Simon Magus</hi> diſcovered himſelfe to be <hi>in the very gall of betterneſſe, and bond of iniquity.</hi> Yet I nothing doubt but we may be deceived; but moſt commonly it comes to paſſe that Hypocrites are the greateſt deceivers and coſeners of themſelves; and it is not their condition to be exerciſed with feares leaſt they be Reprobates, and to confeſſe that their faith, their repentance is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfit. It is moſt likely they deale without Hypocriſy in this.</p>
                              <p>But when any doe lay ſuch ſinnes to their own charge, we will not take them at their word, but we will inquire upon what grounds they deliver this &amp; we will inquire whether now they are well pleaſed with this their former Hypocriſy; If ſo, what cauſe is there, why they ſhould be diſquieted in themſelves upon the conſideration of that wherein they are well pleaſed? But if it be their ſorrow, if this cauſe heavineſſe of heart unto them; here we have a double evidence of ſome ſparkes of grace in them; Firſt in confeſſing their former Hypocriſy. Secondly in being humbled with ſorrow in the conſideration of it; Now God hath promiſed, that if we confeſſe our ſinnes, God as he is faithfull and juſt will forgive them. And if they are humbled in the conſideration of it, and tremble at the apprehenſion of Gods judgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Hypocrites, they are ſo much the fitter for God to take up his habitation in their contrite heart and humble ſpirit <hi>Eſ.</hi> 57. 15. And <hi>Eſ.</hi> 63. 2. I hope there is no <hi>miſerable conſolation in all this;</hi> To miniſter this Phyſicke is to be a <hi>Phiſitian</hi> of ſome <hi>value.</hi> And certainly whatſoever was our former courſe, whether in the way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſſe, or the way of hypocriſy, when God brings us to conſider it and to confeſſe it, and to be acquainted with his feares, and terrours here upon, we have cauſe to conceive good hope, that God is now in a gratious way to draw them neerer unto him, who before were ſtrangers from him. Certainly we will be bold to tell them, that there is no juſt cauſe why they ſhould deſpaire.</p>

I come to the laſt particular he inſiſteth upon; and that is <hi>Piſcators</hi> confeſſion; which becauſe he conceives it ſerves his turne, therefore he aſcribes unto him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity in this. But what ſaith <hi>Piſcator? That no comfort can poſſibly be inſtilled into the ſoules of Reprobates. Piſcators</hi> words are theſe, <hi>Reproborum anxiis animis nulla conſolatio inſtillari poteſt.</hi> This Author addes <hi>Poſſibly</hi> to make it the more waighty as he thinkes. We acknowledg God to be the God of conſolation, and his ſpirit alone to be the comforter, and if God will not give them Chriſt, ſurely they can have no true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in Chriſt; which yet depends meerely upon ſuppoſition of the will of God; like as none but God can give raine; and if it be his will it ſhall raine to morrow or not raine, either ſhall come to paſſe according to his will, and it is impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe then he willeth; yet is raine a contingent thing, and God will have it come to paſſe contingently, that is, ſo as with a poſſibility to the contrary. Now that God gives not all unto Chriſt, our Saviour profeſſeth, <hi>John.</hi> 17. <hi>Thine they were and thou hast given them unto me;</hi> and afterwards, <hi>for their ſakes I ſanctify my ſelfe,</hi> This is ſpoken in reference unto the offering up of himſelf unto his Father upon the Croſſe, as <hi>Maldonate</hi> acknowledgeth to be the interpretation of all the Fathers, whom he he had read. He dyed we confeſſe to procure Salvation for all that believe; but did he dye to procure faith for all? If ſo, then either abſolutely or conditionally. If abſolutly, then all muſt believe and be ſaved. If conditionally, to wit, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſome diſpoſition of man, then it followes that Chriſt hath merited that faith ſhould be conferred on men according to their workes, which is manifeſt Pelagianiſme. But what is this to the purpoſe, namely, that comfort cannot be inſtilled into the ſoules of Reprobates? The queſtion is of comforting the Tempted, not ſuppoſing them to be reprobates. For what ground have we to ſuppoſe any man to be a Reprobate, conſidering that there is no evidence hereof, but either the committing of ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt or finall perſeverance in infidelity or impenitency; and is it to be expected that Chriſtian doctrine ſhould afford any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation unto theſe? But out of the caſe of ſinne committed againſt the Holy Ghoſt there is no cauſe why any man, living in the Church of God, ſhould deſpaire, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him ſelfe to be Reprobate; albeit, untill he believe in Chriſt, we can aſſure him that he is one of Gods elect; whereof the Arminian doctrine can give no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance albeit men doe believe, and albeit an Angell from Heaven ſhould aſſure them that their faith is a true faith. It is true Reprobates muſt beare their burthen of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort that know themſelves to be Reprobates; but who are they? For my part I know none, nor doe I know any reaſon why any man ſhould conceive himſelfe to be of that number, unleſſe he hath ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and let them looke to that who oppoſe the truth of God, and blaſpheme it againſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Therefore to talke of a burthen that is to be borne by we know not whom in particular, no nor they themſelves who are of that number, is a very vaine diſcourſe.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. As for that which <hi>Piſcator</hi> ſaith of the elect, it is to be underſtood only at ſuch a time as when they beginne to feele the burthen of ſinne; which is not alwaies with the firſt, nor at the ſame time in all. As for that he ſaith <hi>of feeling the burthen of ſinne, and a deſire to be freed from it by Chriſt, that they are only probable not infallible arguments of election.</hi> I anſwer, Firſt it is better to have probable arguments of election then none at all; neither am I privy to any probable argument of a mans election that may be attained to by the doctrine of Arminians. Secondly a man may have good ground of conſolation, though he hath not yet any infallible argument of his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; Firſt in as much as Chriſt calleth and encourageth ſuch a one to come unto him, ſaying, <hi>Come unto me all ye that travaile, and are heavy laden.</hi> Blind <hi>Bartimeus</hi> was not a little comforted when it was told him, that Chriſt called him; how much more when we heare him calling us; Secondly in as much as he doth not only bid us to come unto him, but promiſeth that he will eaſe us, and what is that but that he will comfort us. And it is no ſmall comfort to be in the way to the obtaining infallible arguments of a mans election. Laſtly, to deſire to be freed from ſinne by Chriſts, is it any leſſe then to hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe; And hath not our Saviour pronounced all ſuch bleſſed, and promiſed they ſhall be filled? That the grace of Salvation is communicated to ſome few is a thing with out queſtion; For if but few be choſen as our Saviour profeſſeth, undoubtedly there are but few that are ſaved. And directly our Saviour ſignifies as much, when he anſwers to the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:56120:159"/>
queſtion propoſed by his Diſciples (whether but few ſhall be ſaved) in this maner, ſtrive to enter in at the ſtreight gate <hi>&amp;c:</hi> &amp; for a man to conceive that it may be he is one of the number of Gods elect, is enough to keepe him from deſpaire, and from conceiving that he is a Reprobate. Secondly, this is ſpoken of him that is yet but in the way to the ſtate of grace: Whereas by the Arminian doctrine he can have no better aſurance, though he be in the ſtate of grace. Laſtly, <hi>Piſcator</hi> gives to underſtand that this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine doth afford this comfort, to wit, in the apprehenſion of a poſſibility that he is elect; he doth not ſay that it affords but this: Nay, by his doctrine he manifeſteth how the way is open to a farre better conſolation then this, to every one that groanes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burthen of ſinne, and deſires to be freed from it by Chriſt, which he expreſſeth and concludeth in this manner, <hi>Whoſoever feeles the burthen of his ſin deſiring to be freed from it by Christ, and craving the grace of God, him Chriſt will eaſe and ſave. Mat.</hi> 11. <hi>laſt. But thou feeleſt the burthen of thy ſinnes, and deſireſt to be freed from it by Chriſt, and craveſt the grace of God, &amp;c.</hi> For in this caſe he conceives there is a difference betweene ſuch a one and a Reprobate. For Reprobates in ſuch a caſe, feeling the burthen of their ſinnes, doe not ſeeke the grace of God, but rather fly from him as from a ſevere judge; as he ſhewes by the inſtances of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas.</hi> And indeed untill there be in man ſome better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wrought then in a Reprobate, what ground have we to conceive better of him then of a Reprobate, Nor that he is to be concluded to be a Reprobate, but both our judgement concering him and his judgement concerning himſelfe is to be ſuſpended; conſidering that there was a time when the beſt of Gods children were in ſuch a caſe, yet afterwards it hath appeared that even in that former uncomfortable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they were the very elect of God, and in like manner as comfortable may be the condition of theſe, we know not how ſoone; For God calls ſome ſooner, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers latter.</p>

                  <p>THe Authour of this Treatiſe was perſwaded to Pen the reaſons of his opinion againſt abſolute Reprobation, that he might ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie a worthy friend of his, who required it. VVhat ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that learned Gentleman, his friend, hath received by theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I know not: but ſure I am, they have given good content to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who have read them, and doe ſtill deſire a Copie of them for their farther uſe. To eaſe whoſe paines in tranſcribing this Treatiſe, it doth now appeare in this forme. If any of contrary opinion, ſhall undertake to anſwer or refute it; I wiſh, he would ſet downe his opinion and reaſons with that perſpicuitie and modeſtie, that our Authour hath ſet downe his. Such a courſe of diſputing will gaine more credit to himſelfe and his cauſe, then voluminous Vagaries about impertinent things If any ſhall uſe railing ſpeeches, or unneceſſary diverſions from the cauſe; I ſhall ever interpret that to be a ſtrong ſigne of a weake cauſe: or, at leaſt, I ſhall think it to be an argument of an obſtinate minde, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweth how to yeeld to the Truth, nor to defend his errour. I hope the Reader, who loveth his owne ſalvation, will be a more indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Iudge in a queſtion, which concerneth him ſo nearely. And ſo I leave him to God's bleſſing.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen firſt I lighted upon a treatiſe intituled <hi>(God's love to mankind)</hi> and read a little way in it, I had reaſon to be acquainted with it; though the Authors face I had never ſeen: Upon the firſt relation of the change of his opinion in certaine controverſies, as he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I was intreated to conferre with him thereupon by word of mouth: My anſwer was, that it was more fit to conferre in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and if he would be drawne to communicate the reaſons of his pretended change; I ſhould willingly take them into conſideration. This motion was made in the yeare 1631. being then at London; the yeare following in the month of July (as I remember) was the diſcourſe of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Hord's</hi> ſent unto me, and I was urged upon my former promiſe to make anſwer thereunto. At that time I had another bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe under my hand, which I could not diſpatch in leſſe then two months ſpace or more: but I was wiſhed to take my owne time. As ſoone as I was free from my former taske, I ſet hand to this, and returned my anſwere thereunto, unto the Gentleman that ſet me on worke, about the end of Hillary terme <hi>Anno Dom:</hi> 1632. But obſerving the bulke of the treatiſe now in print, twice as bigge, as that in manuſcript or more. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a reply to my former anſwer; but upon peruſall, I found nothing leſſe, whereat I wondred not a little, having never heard of any ſuch treatiſe untill the laſt ſommer, 1635: for ſurely they had time enough to anſwer it. To helpe the credit of their cauſe in this; it ſeemed good unto them to raiſe a miſt, that their abſurd carriage might not be diſcovered, to witt: by antedating the print thereof, which yet was but newly found creeping in corners. Another deviſe there is by a large interpolation and addition, here and there foyſted into the body of the former diſcourſe, and yet not all at once, but by pathes, a great part of it being but lumber; and the adding of more teſtimonies, as if the matter were to be carried by number and not by weight, or as if the Author of them were willing to make oſtentation of the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and fullneſſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place booke. Only the upper way of our Divines maintayning the abſoluteneſſe of <hi>God's decrees</hi> is here inpugned at large, with the Authors beſt ſtrength I doubt not; which taske was omitted by Mr <hi>Hord:</hi> And beſides there is one Divine attribute more here mentioned, in contradiction whereunto the Doctrine of our Divines is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to proceed, and the proſecution hereof amongſt the reſt is here ſet downe, by way of ſuperfaetation upon the former, not only that ſo the argument might be the more compleat, but alſo to caſt a colour; that this diſcourſe of Mr <hi>Hord's</hi> hath not as yet been anſwered. It may be it would faine have ſhewed it ſelfe unto the world in this maſculine ſhape and vigour before this time, if Doctor <hi>Duppa</hi> while he was <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancellour</hi> at Oxford would have given way to the printing of it, if it be true as I have heard, that it was offered unto him to be licenced for the preſſe. Doctor <hi>Potter</hi> alſo of Queenes Colledge performed a freindly part to ſome body in checking the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners for ſelling the copies of it, forwhich courteſy, I doe account my ſelfe ſo much in his debt as that comes to; and ſhould much more, had he ſent me one of the copies, as he did noe leſſe then ſix on the ſame day to his friend Doctor <hi>Aigleonbee;</hi> as the Book-ſeller confeſſed to a Scholar a friend of mine. Well Mr <hi>Hord's</hi> treatiſe is at length come to the Preſſe, and ſhewes it ſelfe in publique without ſhame, though I thought it had been ſufficiently confounded almoſt three yeares agoe; yet this Miſtres bluſhes not, though dares not open her mouth to cleare her reputation in any one particular of that which I layd to her charge, manifeſting her to be no Daughter of God's truth, but a meere Baſtard, begotten by a carnall wit, upon a ſpecious pretence by miſerable deflowring and adulterating the word of God; <hi>one builds a wall</hi> as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>and another daubeth that with untempered mortar.</hi> Mr <hi>Hord</hi> is well knowne to be the Author of the firſt by mee formerly anſwered. But what <hi>Maſon's</hi> hand was uſed in the addition, that is concealed; but that may breake out into pregnant evidences before we have gone through with it.</p>

The Prefacer at the firſt chop begins with a notorious untruth, and that in more particulars then one; for firſt, whom doth he meane by the Author of this Treatiſe? M. <hi>Horde?</hi> That which M. <hi>Horde</hi> ſent to his worthy friend is yet to be ſeen, containing not halfe ſo much as this; it was not above 30 leaves manuſcript, and that not cloſely, but written at large; And this containes 55 leaves in print. But it may bee M. <hi>Horde</hi> hath ſince inlarged his own diſcourſe, and ſo continues to be author of it, not in part only, but in the whole. And I confeſſe it may be, he is as much the Author of the one as of the other; if it be true as ſome have told me of the very firſt, ſent to his friend indeed, namely that it was the very ſtrength of M. <hi>Maſon;</hi> him I knowe of old, and ſhould be acquainted with his ſufficiency, though it was a long time ere I had ſo much as heard of his zeale for the Arminian cauſe, and after I heard ſo much, it was yet lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ere I could believe it, untill I ſaw it under his own hand: And whereas M. <hi>Horde</hi> comming to his ſecond convincing Argument, as he calls it, drawne from Attributes Divine, layeth downe certaine premiſes, the ſecond whereof is this; <hi>That juſtice, mercy, truth, and holineſſe, in God are the ſame in nature with theſe vertues in men, though infinitely differing in Degrees.</hi> I willingly confeſſe I ſtood amaz'd, and albeit I conceived it, and doe conceave it to be one of the abſurdeſt poſitions that ever dropped from the pen of a Schoole Divine; yet the adventure was ſo great in my judgement, that I was apt to imagine that it proceeded not from a vulgar ſpirit. This conceit of mine was impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the reaſons he brings to juſtifie ſo ſtrange a Paradox: for they are plauſible &amp; make a faire ſhew at the firſt, like the fruit of Sodom; but cruſh them once, come to the Scholaſtical diſcuſſion of them, &amp; forthwith <hi>In Cineres abeunt &amp; vagam fuliginem,</hi> they vaniſh into ſmoak and emptineſſe. A ſecond untruth is this, that he ſaith, <hi>The Author was perſwaded by a worthy friend to pen the Reaſons of his opinion againſt abſolute reprobation;</hi> for he was only put upon ſhewing reaſons of the change of his opinion in the controverſies of late debated between the Remonſtrants &amp; their oppoſites, as M. <hi>Horde</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth in his Preface. M. <hi>Horde</hi> indeed is willing to drawe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto the conſideration of Gods decrees, as if that were the maine <note place="margin">Thing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> moſt abſurdly, and quite contrary to the doctrine of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who ſhapes the decrees of God in conformitie to the doctrine of grace; and accordingly to certifie the <hi>Maſſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſes</hi> in the doctrine of Praedeſtination, he thinks it moſt fit to begin with proving that <hi>Faith is the gift of God,</hi> yea the very <hi>beginning of it.</hi> Now he liked not to follow <hi>Auſtins</hi> courſe, and in the firſt place to deale upon the point of grace. And herein hee ſavours of M. <hi>Maſons</hi> ſpirit, for that is his courſe, as I have ſeen under his hand; yet ſuppoſe that this be the maine thing, controverted, namely the qualitie of Gods decrees, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be abſolute or conditionall only. How doth he ſatisfie his friend, or performe the promiſe made in letting election paſſe untouched, and dealing only upon repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation? And this I know alſo to have been M. <hi>Maſons</hi> genuine courſe, far worſe then the Remonſtrants in the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort,</hi> for they made a motion, that they might deal upon reprobation in the firſt place, and then upon election, wherein notwithſtanding they were condemned in the judgement of all forraigne Divines, aſſiſtant there. But this Author and M. <hi>Maſon</hi> too, on my knowledge, affect to deale upon reprobation only. Yet I have alwaies been, and ſtill am glad to ſee the utmoſt of their ſtrength, or any mans ſtrength on any of the five points, and ſhould be very glad to ſee what they could ſay upon the point of free will, which is moſt congruous for them, though they meddle not at all with grace. For even on that point I ſeem to have profited more, lately by dealing with ſome Engliſh Arminians, then ever before, having alwaies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that to be a point very obſcure, like as is the nature of originall ſinne which was one of the three points, concerning which I did not look to live ſo long, as to meet with convenient ſatisfaction. M. <hi>Horde</hi> (I heard) conferred with M. <hi>Maſon,</hi> about Election, and told him that the doctrine of our Divines therein ſeemed very comfortable to the children of God, whereunto M. <hi>Maſon</hi> ſhould anſwer, by granting that, but then adding, it was very prone to provoke men to looſeneſſe of life. This conceſſion was as a ſhooing horne to draw M. <hi>Horde</hi> on to the Remonſtranticall Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, nothing doubting, but in the end to take him of from entertaining ſo good an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of our doctrine of Election, as if it were not any ſuch comfortable condition; &amp; teach him to magnifie the comfortable condition of the adverſaries doctrine, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon a threefold cord, which as the proverb faith, cannot eaſily be broken. 1. The univerſalitie of Gods love, 2. The univerſalitie of Chriſts redemption. 3. The univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the Covenant of grace: Thus the comforts of the Remonſtrants are multiplied
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56120:163"/>
and advanced, which in the iſſue comes to this, that their condition is as comfortable as any reprobates condition throughout the world, whether <hi>Cain's</hi> or <hi>Iſhmael's,</hi> or <hi>Eſau's</hi> or <hi>Doeg's</hi> or <hi>Iuda's,</hi> or the Grand Senior among the Turkes, or the whole guard of his Janiſaries: for God's love is towards all, Chriſt's redemption extends to all, and the Covenant of Grace belongs to all. And what comfortable creatures muſt theſe needes be, upon ſo various and comfortable conſiderations? And the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Arminians, are herein inferiour to none of them all. And though they will not be ſo ſaucie as to promiſe unto themſelves perſeverance in the ſtate of grace; yet they will be ſo bold as to promiſe both to themſelves and to all their Proſelites perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in this eſtate of conſolation, nothing inferiour to any Reprobates conſolation in the world. But the miſchiefe is, that hence it followes, that the conſolation of any of God's children, whether <hi>Abraham, Iſaack, Iacob, David,</hi> or <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> nor any other excepted, was never greater, then the conſolation of the wicked'ſt Chriſtian that ever lived, whether prophane or hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, Provided he did believe theſe myſteries of Arminian godlynes; namely that God's love is towards all, Chriſt dyed for the redemption of all, and laſtly that the Covenant of Grace belongs to all; for theſe are the ſweet and precious flowers of conſolation that grow in the gardens and writings of theſe Divines; to the aſtoniſhment of the world, in conſidering the power and efficacy of Satan: and that, even in the Church of God, ſo many ſhould be given up to ſo ſtrange deluſions. He doth not know what ſatisfaction that learned Gentleman his friend hath received by theſe reaſons, nor I neither; for I am not privy to the leaſt ſatisfaction he hath received. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, rather how he hath found the vileneſſe of theſe Remonſtranticall Tenets diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and the vanity of all ſupports uſed to underprop them. Sure he is, <hi>They have given good content to others;</hi> give we him leave to be liberall in his owne commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: we doe not know how farre he dwells from neighbours: yet no marvaile if they give good content to many, who have been ſeaſoned with the like ſpeculations: I have ſeen a manuſcript with this inſcription, <hi>A ſurvey of the new Platforme of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi> the method of it is much like to this, and it ends with a dialogue in the point of conſolation; as if both Authours had dipt their pen in the ſame inck-pot. And now to heare and ſee <hi>Demogorgon</hi> himſelfe play his part, and explicate his <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanck ſacultie</hi> in diſplaying the ſtrength of his <hi>Opobalſamum;</hi> as he did of his <hi>Cathol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icon,</hi> whom the Frenchman brings in his <hi>Satyre Mennippiſed,</hi> no marvaile if they are well perſwaded that no Pandora can equall that for vniverſalities of graces: when in the meane time they all fall ſhort of that <hi>unum neceſſarium,</hi> which yet like enough they are ready to forſweare, and profeſſe they will turne <note place="margin">I have read this in one of their letters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to a Scholler of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted it to me</note> open Atheiſts rather then believe it: ſtill he keeps himſelfe upon the commendation of his Proſelite, which cannot but reflect ſome ſweet content upon himſelfe, who is the Engineer and perhaps the Spirit that animates him and ſets him on worke,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>For if the man ſuch prayſes have,</l>
                     <l>What then ſhall he that inſpires the knave.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>He commends the Author for perſpicuitie in writing and modeſty, and he wiſheth that whoſoever undertakes to anſwer it fully will performe the like. For my part I cannot change my ſtile: but my deſire is, I may diſcover their fopperies, as perſpicuouſly as I can, and I hope nothing to faile in performance; like enough the Authour of the preface as well as the Authour of the diſcourſe deſires to be gently handled and that he calls modeſty, yet when a man will have his horſe to be well curried, it is not for want of love to his horſe; but becauſe the condition of his horſe requires to be ſo dealt withall: I thanke God, I never projected any immodeſt carriage; never could any adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary move me ſo farre; But as an excellent footeball-player of our Houſe, who would lay any man on his backe handſomly without hurt (and he was a Biſhop's Sonne) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſired to ſhew any other how to doe the like; anſwered with proteſtation that he never proceeded by any rules: but as he found his oppoſite, ſo he Coped with him. In like ſort, as I find my adverſarie; ſo I deale with him for the preſent, as the Condition of his carriage to my ſeeming deſerves, and if I handſomly lay his opinions on the ground without doing him any harme, methinkes I ſhould be rather loved then hated of my very enemies for this; As for the preſent my Oppoſite ſeemes to have a care of my credit, for the gaining whereof he chaulkes me out a way, to wit: by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting perſpicuouſly, and modeſtly, without <hi>voluminous vagaries</hi> about impertinent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56120:164"/>
things. This he delivers very gravely and demurely, which is in my judgment very ridiculous; and, if I doe expreſſe it and anſwer it as it deſerves, I think, I ſhould carry my ſelfe decently in anſwering him according to his ridiculous condition, and telling him that he doth not well in ſhewing ſuch charity towards his adverſary, which the world will be apt to interpret, as proceeding from a cowardly diſpoſition. The Spaniards at the Fort of Breſt, when Sr John <hi>Norris</hi> went forth in hunting of the hare, and his hounds purſued the hare into the very Fort, they tooke his hounds and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them up over the wall, not in ſpite of ſo renowned a Generall, but to repreſent their feareles condition, and that they looked for no favour at his hands. Magnanimitie, not malice moved them unto this, which magnanimitie might ſtrike feare into their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, though it did not, who tooke the Fort, though it coſt them deare. I write with a purpoſe to expoſe my ſelfe to the cenſure of the world as they ſhall find cauſe; but I regard not the cenſures of an Adverſary: eſpecially in ſuch a cauſe which <hi>Bradwardine</hi> Stiles, <hi>The cauſe of God againſt Pelagius.</hi> And truly I confeſſe I get ſomething by this very phraſe of my Adverſaries <hi>Voluminous vagaries</hi> about impertinent things: which makes me conclude, that certainely both this Author, and his Interpolator have ſeen my anſwer to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Hord's Treatiſe,</hi> wherein I have ſome vagaries I confeſſe, to refreſh my Spirit upon emergent occaſions. For, being taking of from my ſtudies to ſee a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger who <hi>deſired</hi> my companie; I was ſuddenly inſtructed in a new learning of Nine cauſes, who never was accquainted with above 4. before in the Univerſitie, and one of the nine was <hi>finding out,</hi> of which I made good uſe upon my returne; in finding out the Sopheſtry of the Remonſtrants, in certaine Arguments of theirs. This liberty of Spirit to refreſh my ſelfe and my Reader, it may be this Author ſpites: whereas I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I ſhould take no offence on his part for the like; But it may be his gravity tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports him to be of the ſame mind with Raynold the Fox, who having loſt his owne tayle in a Ginne afterwards he endevours very compoſedly to perſwade his fellowes to cut of their tayles alſo. And to that purpoſe ſuffered his wit to exuberate in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting and amplifying the incommodious condition of ſuch a member: Railing ſpeeches, I know no reaſon why any man ſhould feare from his adverſary; for ſuch, <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> hath taught me, doe defile the Railer only, not him that is railed on. And if any man be pleaſed to ſpit in my face that way, though I am naturally very melancholly, yet I am perſwaded he ſhall find little melancholly predominant in my anſwering him. As for unneceſſarie diviſions for the cauſe, which he doth ſeriouſly and wiſely admoniſh his Adverſary to beware of. I willingly profeſſe, I love to have Sea roome, and not to be confined unto ſtraights by any ſullen rules of my Adverſarie; and truly I perſcribe to none, but as I find him, ſo I frame my ſelfe to grapple with him, as congruouſly as I can. If God be on my ſide, why ſhould I be afraid of any colours. Let the Divell and all his Angels of Darkneſſe lye in camp againſt me; I ſhall not budge: But here is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger mentioned, which I profeſſe, I did not project, and that is the daſhing of my ſelfe upon the rocks of my Adverſaries diſpleaſure. And his interpretation of my courſes to my diſpleaſure. For if I doe not conforme to his ſullen rules of <hi>Stoicall moralitie,</hi> he ſhall ever interpret it; (I marke well the Phraſe, he comes not willingly on to make harſh interpratations, but he ſhall doe it) as much as to ſay the uprightneſſe of his judgment and the juſtice of his diſpoſition will urge him hereunto, namely <hi>to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it, As a ſtrong ſigne of a weake cauſe,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>an Argument of an obſtinate minde:</hi> But ſoft and faire, who made my Adverſary my Judge; by whoſe interpretations I am to ſtand or fall? How Imperiouſly doth he carry himſelfe in this; as if he were ſome Bugbeare, or dreadfull Adverſary doe I ſay? or Magiſtrate rather, ſee the poverty of my wit and of my Spirit too; the one was never ſo inventious of any ſuch trick, nor the other ſo audacious, or immodeſt (if I may be ſo bold ſoe to ſpeak) as to ſerve my ſelfe therewith, to ſcarre my Adverſary, deſparing by faire waies to overcome him, and make him yeild, or elſe his obſtinacy knowne to the world: for who ſeeth not, that I have as much authoritie to threaten him with the ſharpneſſe of my interpretations of him; as he to threaten me not with the like auſtereneſſe of his? I am willingly content the world may judge between us, both of the cauſe debated and of our carriage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in throughout, and who hath the truth on his ſide, and ſhews moſt learning and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty in the maintayning of that he undertakes; I willingly confeſſe, the five points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted are tender points, and the knowledge of the truth herein, meerly concerning a mans ſalvation; But this Author deales only upon the halfe of one of them, and that moſt needleſſe alſo: And the reſolution of the Doctrine of Election depends upon the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56120:164"/>
reſolution of the doctrine of Election depends upon the reſolution of an other point; namely, whether <hi>Grace be conferred freely, or according to mens workes;</hi> That it is confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red freely, and not according to workes; hereupon it is that <hi>Auſtin</hi> builds the abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of predeſtination and election, wherence it followeth evidently, that as many as doe maintaine the Decree of predeſtination to be conditionall, muſt alſo in <hi>Auſtin's</hi> judgment maintaine that <hi>Grace is given according unto workes,</hi> which was of old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the Synod of Palaeſtine, and all along in divers Synods and Provinciall Councells againſt the Pelagians. Now if Predeſtination be abſolute and not conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; it followes that Reprobation alſo is abſolute and not conditionall; which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence I preſume, the Author of theſe additions will not deny. But as there is a great deale of craft in dawbing; ſo theſe craftie Crowders are apt to worke upon generalities and in diſtinctions: Reprobation we know is as well from Grace as from glory, and God's reprobation from glory is joyned with a purpoſe to inflict damnation. Now as touching Reprobation from grace, we readily profeſſe that God hath both ordained to deny grace unto <hi>ſome</hi> of his meere pleaſure; like as he hath ordained to beſtow that upon others of his meere pleaſure; and alſo of his meere pleaſure hath made ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. And theſe Authors dare not mainifeſtly oppoſe us in this argument, leſt the ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er leaven of their Pelagian Tenet manifeſt it ſelfe to the whole world, namely in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that grace is conferred according to workes: But as touching reprobation from Glory, and God's purpoſe to inflict Damnation, Theſe Juglers ſo carry the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as if they would make the world believe our Doctrine is, that God decreed to deny men Glory and to inflict Damnation, not for their ſinnes; but meerely, becauſe it is his pleaſure ſo to doe, a moſt unſhamefaſt crimination: For albeit that God hath made no law, according whereunto, he proceeds in giving grace unto ſome, and denying it unto others, but herein proceeds meerely according unto his pleaſure, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to men's workes; it being manifeſt <hi>Pelagianiſme</hi> to affirme the contrary; yet we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly &amp; willingly profes (And all the Chriſtian world knowes it to be true) That God hath made a law whereunto according he proceeds in the diſtribution of rewards and Puniſhments, namely theſe, <hi>Whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved, whoſoever believeth not ſhall be damned:</hi> And according to this law, God hath decreed from everlaſting to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in pronouncing the ſentence of Salvation and Damnation on mankind, namely to beſtow Salvation not of his meere pleaſure, without all reſpect of the workes of men, but as a reward of their faith, repentance, and good workes, and to inflict damnation not of his owne meere pleaſure without any reſpect to the workes of men, but as a due reward for their ſinnes never broken of by repentance. Only this decree thus to proceed in the execution of rewards and puniſhments, we profeſſe God hath made according to the meere pleaſure of his will, whereby it is apparent, that theſe men play the part of notable Impoſtours, when they abuſe the world's credulitie in making them believe, that we maintaine any ſuch abſurd decrees or executions of decrees, which they obtrude upon us; and to this purpoſe theſe are willing to take the benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>Confuſion;</hi> for it is moſt profitable for ſome to fiſh in troubled waters, and to walke in the darke: But when the light of diſtinction comes, this madd's them to ſee their impoſtures diſcovered, and their ſophiſtications made to appeare in their proper colours. <hi>The eye of the Adulterer</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iob) waiteth for the twilight, and ſaieth, no eye ſhall ſee me, and diſguiſeth his face, They dig through houſes in the darke, which they marked for themſelves in the day, they know not the light, but the morning is even to them, as the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, if one know them, they are in the terrours of the ſhadow of death;</hi> Now there is a courſe of adulterating the word of God, and deflouring his truth every way, as abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable in the ſight of God, as the deflowring of women; yea and much more abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; In my anſwer to the former diſcourſe, as I remember, I propoſed certaine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove the abſolute nature of Reprobation. This Authour doth not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate himſelfe, nor his <hi>Achates</hi> neither to anſwer ſo much as one of them. Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Prefaced concerning theſe concealed Authours, and therewithall made anſwer to the Preface of this Interpolator, I come to make anſwer to the <hi>Additions</hi> themſelves.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Let the Reader obſerve that this Authour in ſtating the opinion of our Divines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth no paſſages out of any of them, no nor ſo much as quotes the place of any of <note place="margin">Anſwer</note> their writings where this doctrine is to be found in the terme wherein he delivers it, that ſo, he may take the greater libertie to ſhape their opinions according to his owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; firſt, as touching the firſt obſerve. 1. How he ſhapes this opinion. 2, the Perſons to whom he imputes it; concerning the firſt, the Decree is ſhaped as conſiſting of two parts; The one ſets downe the end, which God intended, the other the meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this end is procured.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As touching the end, it is hard to ſay, by his ſhaping of it, whether the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's glory be made the end, or man's damnation; and if any one conceaves hereupon, that man's Damnation is the end which God intended in the opinion of our Divines, like enough this Authour will be well enough pleaſed with it. 2. Conſider how God's Soveraingtie and Juſtice are coupled together, as appearing in the eternall rejection and damnation of his Creatures, as if both of them did appeare equally in each. 3. Then rejection is propoſed without diſtinction and ſpecification, that we might know whether he underſtands it of rejection from Grace, or rejection from Glorie. 4. And in the fourth place, he couples rejection with Damnation, as if both were of equall yoke; ſignifying Acts temporall; whereas rejection in the Common no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof is all one with reprobation, and reprobation is commonly taken for an act eternall, to witt, The eternall purpoſe of God to deny grace, permit ſinne, and inflict damnation for ſinne. 5. Damnation is here brought in as belonging to the Decree of the end; and quite left out in the Decree of the meanes: whereas by the very light of Nature it is apparent, that Juſtice vindicative is manifeſted no where more, then in the execution of puniſhment. 6. And laſtly Damnation in it ſelfe is no mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Juſtice any more, then of Injuſtice; unleſſe it be executed as a condigne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for ſinne; yet moſt abſurdly he talks of manifeſting juſtice in man's Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without ſpecifying the meritorious cauſe of Damnation; without conſideration whereof, Damnation is no manifeſtation of Juſtice, either Divine, or humane. 7. Whereas he ſets forth the Perſons damned to be the greateſt part of Man-kind, this is only to ſpeak with a full mouth, and to gull a partiall Reader, who may be well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have his mouth filled with an emptie ſpoone: For the Scripture teatheth expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that even of them that are called but few are choſen; and clear reaſon doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that look how God may deale with one, in the ſame manner it is lawfull for him to deale with Millions. We love to ſpeak diſtinctly, and accordingly we ſay, that all God's decrees; are of doing ſomething for the manifeſtation of his owne Glory. I ſay of doing ſomething, for no glory of God is manifeſted in Decreeing, but in executing his Decrees; As when <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>God hath made all things for himſelfe, even the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the day of evill</hi> Prov: 16: 4. So then the manifeſtation of God's Glory is the end of all his actions. And accordingly if rejection here be taken for God's Decree, no glory is manifeſted herein, and too abſurd it is to account God's eternall Decrees to to be meanes for the accompliſhing of his ends: But if Rejection be taken here for a temporall Act, to witt: Of finall dereliction in ſinne, then it may be a meanes for the manifeſtation of God's glory in a certaine kind, namely, his Soveraigntie; for like as God hath mercy on whom he will, in not leaving them finally in their ſinnes; but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them from the power of it, by beſtowing on them the Grace of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. In like manner, God hardneth whom he will, in denying the ſame Grace of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56120:165"/>
Faith and Repentance, and ſo finally leaving them and permitting them to continue fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in their ſinnes, without breaking them of by repentance. So that God proceed's herein merely according to his pleaſure, for the manifeſtation of that Soveraingtie which he hath as a Creator over his Creatures. Even the ſame that the <hi>Potter hath over his Clay, to make of the ſame lump one veſſell unto honour, an other unto diſhonour.</hi> No Juſtice is manifeſted in this difference, I meane no ſuch Juſtice as proceedes in reference to the workes of men; for he doth not beſtow Grace upon men, becauſe of their good workes; nor deny grace unto them, becauſe of their evill workes; but finding men equall in the ſtate of ſinne, he beſtowes Grace upon the one to cure ſinne in them, and beſtowes it not upon others. Yet God is juſt herein in another reſpect, namely in as much as he doth no other thing in all this, but ſuch as he hath a lawfull power to doe; As for Damnation, that is clearly an Act temporall; and this the Lord inflicts on none but for their ſinnes: And like as in giving or denying grace, God manifeſted no juſtice Compenſative, but Soveraigntie, only proceeding therein merely according unto pleaſure: So in inflicting da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation &amp; denying glory, he manifeſt's vindicative Juſtice alone, not proceeding according to mere pleaſure herein but according to mens workes, and that according to a Law which himſelfe hath given unto men, namely this, <hi>Whoſoever continueth in ſin without repentance ſhall be damned.</hi> 2. The ſecond part of this Decree is concerning the meanes; and the meanes he makes to be ſinne and impenitency: It is very well he tooke libertie to ſet downe their opinion without ſpecifying their words, leaſt they ſhould fly in his face, and convict him of ſhamefull ſlaunder. He that intends the end is the Authour of the meanes: this is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, we ſay that the permiſſion of ſinne and of impenitencie is the meanes, and this we acknowledge to make way, as well for the manifeſtation of his mercy in pardoning ſinne, as of his Juſtice in puniſhing it; it being apparent that neither mercy in pardoning, nor Juſtice in puniſhing can have place; unleſſe ſinne be permitted to enter into the world: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and above this ſinne is ſtiled <hi>unavoidable</hi> without all diſtinction, ſuch is the proper language of the Arminian Court; we ſay all ſinnes are avoydable by Grace, and that no ſinne can be avoided in an acceptable manner without Grace, and here I ſpeak not of grace reſtrayning only, but of Grace ſanctifying. Here if it pleaſed him, he might have put in Damnation alſo for ſinne, as without all doubt a principall meanes of promoting the manifeſtation of God's Juſtice; and <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> expreſly profeſſeth, that <hi>Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio includit voluntatem permittendi culpam &amp; damnationem inferendi pro culpa.</hi> Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion includes God's will to permit ſinne, and to inflict Damnation for ſinne; here is the Decree concerning meanes. And as for the end hereof, both <hi>Aquinas</hi> (and <hi>Alvarez</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him) profeſſeth, that the manifeſtation of God's glory in the way of vindicative Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice as intended by him, as the end of all this. 2. As for the Perſons here named to take this way 1. <hi>Calvin</hi> though this Authour placeth him amongſt the Supralapſarians, yet <hi>Lub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> doth not in his treatiſe of predeſtination, but oppoſeth <hi>Vorſtius</hi> in this particular; <hi>Cornelius de Lapide,</hi> a Jeſuite upon the 18: verſe of the 9: to the Romans, agrees with <hi>Lub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> in this; <hi>Calvin's</hi> owne wordes are theſe <hi>de praedeſtinatione</hi> pag: 710. <hi>Cum de Praedeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natione ſermo habetur, inde exordiendum eſſe conſtanter ſemper docui atque hodie doceo, jure in morte relinqui omnes Reprobos, qui in Adam mortui ſunt ac damnati jure periere, qui naturâ ſunt filii irae,</hi> When we treate of Praedeſtination, I ever taught and to this day teach, that we ought to begin it from thence; That all Reprobates are juſtly left in death, who are dead in <hi>Adam,</hi> and damned, and that they juſtly periſh, who by nature are children of wrath. 2. <hi>Lubbertus</hi> ſhewes <hi>Beza</hi> alſo to concurre in the ſame. 3. <hi>Piſcator</hi> in a ſmall Treatiſe of the object of Predeſtination, annexed to his anſwer to <hi>Hemnigius</hi> of univerſall Grace, though he makes the Decree of making all men in <hi>Adam</hi> to different ends, and of permitting them to fall in <hi>Adam</hi> to precede the conſideration of the Corrupt Maſſe, as it is evident they muſt, Yet the Decrees of Election and Reprobation he ſubordinates to the foreſight of the corrupt Maſſe. 4. And as for <hi>Zanchy,</hi> let but his Generall definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Predeſtination be conſidered, it will appeare that he diſtinguiſheth the particulars of the Decree of Predeſtination as <hi>Piſcator</hi> doth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I come to the ſecond opinion; and as for the great inconveniencies which here is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that the Authours thereof deſire to decline. I have anſwered hereunto upon, the Treatiſe of M. <hi>Hord,</hi> and ſhewed that not ſo much to decline inconveniencies have ſome embraced this way, as rather becauſe this way ſeemes to be more familiar and plaine, and chiefly becauſe the formall Notions of the particulars of the Decrees of Election and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, the one in the Generall ſeeming to be a worke of mercy, the other of Juſtice, ſeeme to ſuppoſe a conſideration of man in the ſtate of miſerie.

might take this way to avoid inconveniencies, yet I have ſhewed in my anſwer to <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> that none of theſe are at all avoided this way. And then againe both theſe opinions have I endeavoured to reconcile in my <hi>Vindiciae,</hi> and withall ſhewed that the difference whatſoever it comes to, is but <hi>in apice logico; in a point of logick:</hi> both ſides concurring in the maintenance both of God's Soveraigne prerogative over his Creatures, to make one veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell unto honour, another unto diſhonour, by giving faith and repentance unto the one, and denying it to others; as alſo in the prerogative of Grace as only effectuall to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of men unto faith and Repentance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God decrees both to Create all men in <hi>Adam,</hi> and to permit them all to fall in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi> Theſe be the Divine Decrees concerning meanes tending to the manifeſtation of his Glory in the way of Mercy and Juſtice; except man were created, no Glory at all could be manifeſted in him; unleſſe all were ſuffered to fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> there were neither place for mercy, nor Juſtice: theſe are generall decrees concerning all; then there are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall degrees of difference to be joyned to theſe generall decrees; 1. The one is of raiſing ſome out of ſinne by Faith and Repentance, and beſtowing Salvation on them by way of reward for the manifeſtation of God's mercy. 2. The other is of leaving others in ſinne, and permitting them finally to perſevere therein, and inflicting Damnation for their ſinnes, the end whereof is the manifeſtation of God's Juſtice: The decree of manifeſting theſe is alone the decree of the end, all the reſt are decrees of the meanes tending to theſe ends; whereof the two firſt are generall and concerne all, whether Elect, or Reprobate, the reſt are ſpeciall, concerning either the Elect alone, or the Reprobate alone. 3. Now here is a colour caſt, as if the ſpeciall Decrees did praemiſe the two generall Decrees: But this is a mere colour, as I have ſhewed you in my <hi>Vindiciae,</hi> 2. And even they that take this way, maintaine that God ordaines no man to Damnation but for ſinne, and that both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, as well as originall, which is utterly pretermitted by this Authour. 3. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is expreſſe that of them that are called, few are choſen. 4.

Now the Scripture frequently juſtifies this; for the 10 Kings to give their Kingdomes to the Beaſt, what is the meaning of it, But to imploy their Regall power in ſupporting the Pope-dome?

Secondly it would follow, that God is changed: for certainely when he damnes men he hath no will to ſave them.

                  <p>The difference which this Authour takes into Conſideration is about the object of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination; and the difference in opinion thereabouts is uſually to be obſerved three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold (though this Authour is pleaſed to take notice of a ſecondfold difference,) for ſome conceive the object of Predeſtination to be man-kind as yet not created; others conceive the object thereof to be man-kind created, but not yet corrupted. A third ſort maintaine the object thereof to be man-kind both created and corrupted. Now D. <hi>Iunius</hi> hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to reconcile the three opinions, making place for each conſideration in the object of predeſtination; And <hi>Piſcator</hi> after him adventured on the like reconciliation, and hath performed it with more perſpicuitie and with better ſucceſſe in my judgment, then <hi>Iunius;</hi> And that according to three different acts concurring unto Predeſtination; The firſt is, ſaith he, God's purpoſe to create man-kind in <hi>Adam</hi> unto different ends, now this Act doth clearely require the object thereof to be man-kind not yet Created. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Act he conceives to be God's Decree to permit all men to fall in <hi>Adam;</hi> Now this Act he conceives as clearly to ſuppoſe the object thereof to be man-kind created, but not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. The third &amp; laſt Act he conceives to be God's decree to chooſe ſome, to ſhew com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on them in raiſing them out of ſinne by ſaith and repentance, and of Reprobating others, leaving them as be findes them, and permitting them to finiſh their dayes in ſinne, to the end he might manifeſt the glorie of his grace, in ſaving the one; &amp; the glorie of his Juſtice in damning others. Now this third Act he ſuppoſeth manifeſtly to require the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereof to be man-kind both created and corrupted: Now the Authours of theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall opinions have no reaſon to go together by the eares about theſe three opinions, but with Brotherly love to entertaine one another: Firſt, becauſe the difference herein is not ſo much in Divinitie, as in Logick and Philoſophie; difference in opinion about order in intentions, being meerly Logicall, and to be compoſed according to the right ſtating of the end intended, and of the meanes conducing to the end; it being generally confeſſed, that the intention of the end is before the intention of meanes conducing thereunto. And that look what is firſt in intention, the ſame muſt be laſt in execution. Secondly, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of theſe ſeverall opinions about the object of Predeſtination, doe all agree in two principall points. 1. That all men, before God's eternall predeſtination and reprobation, are conſidered as equall in themſelves, whether as uncreated, or as created, but not corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, or laſtly, whether created or corrupted. 2 That God's grace only makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, chooſing ſome to worke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to faith, &amp; repentance, &amp; perſeverance therein; while he rejecteth others, leaving the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he findes them, &amp; permitting them to finiſh their dayes in ſinne, whereby is upheld and maintained. 1. Firſt, the prerogative of God's grace as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effectuall to the working of men unto that which is good. 2. And ſecondly, the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of God's Soveraigntie in ſhewing mercy on whome he will, to bring them to Faith and true repentance, and hardning others; that is, not beſtowing of grace and repentance upon them And ſeeing they all agree in theſe momentous points of Divinitie, they have no cauſe to take it offenſively at the hands of one another, that they differ in a point of Logick. Now I have adventured, on this argument to find out to my ſelfe, and give unto others ſome better ſatiſfaction, then formerly hath been exhibited, and that by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Two decrees only on each part, to witt, the decree of the end, and the decree of the meanes: As for example, 1. On the part of Predeſtination and Election, I conceive the end to be the manifeſtation of God's glorious grace in the way of mercie mixt with Juſtice, on a certaine number of men. And the Decree of the meanes is to create them and permit them all to fall in <hi>Adam</hi> and to bring them forth into the world in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall generations clothed with originall ſinne; and to ſend Chriſt into the world to dye
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56120:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for them, and for Chriſt's ſake firſt to beſtow the grace of faith and repentance upon them, and finally to ſave them. 2. On the part of Reprobation I conceive the end to be the manifeſtation of God's glory in the way of Juſtice vindicative; And the decree of meanes to be partly common and partly proper; the common meanes are to create them and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them all to fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> and bring them forth into the world clothed with originall ſin; the ſpeciall meanes are to leave them as he finds them, and permit them to finiſh their daies in ſinne, and ſo not ſhewing the like grace to them, which he ſhewed to others. 1. So that the moving cauſe of Reprobation is the alone will of God, and not the ſinne of man originall and actuall; like as on the other ſide, the moving cauſe of election is only the will of God, or not faith, or any good workes, whereupon this Authour is loath to manifeſt his opinion; This doctrine is not only approved by Doctour <hi>Whitaker</hi> Doctour of the Chaire in the Univerſitie of Cambridge, and that in his <hi>Cygnea Cantio</hi> a little before his death, but juſtified and confirmed by varietie of Teſtimonies both of Schoolemen, as <hi>Lumbard, Aquinas, Bannes, Petrus de Alliaco, Gregorius, Arminenſis;</hi> of our owne Church and the Divines thereof, as taught by <hi>Bucer</hi> at Cambridge, by <hi>Peter</hi> Martyr at Oxon: profeſſed by the Biſhops and others, promoted by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and farther in the yeare of our Lord 1592: there was a famous recantation made in the Univerſitie of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge by one <hi>Barret</hi> in the 37. of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> whereunto he was urged by the heads of houſes of that Univerſitie. The Recantation runnes thus, <hi>Preaching in Latine not long ſince in the Univerſitie Church, (Right worſhipfull) many things ſlipt from me, both falſly and raſhſly ſpoken, whereby I underſtand the mindes of many have been grieved, to the end therefore I may ſatifie the Church &amp; the truth which I have publiquely hurt; I doe make this publique con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, both Repenting and Revoking my Errour; Firſt I ſaid that no man in this tranſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly, I affirmed that the faith of Peter could not faile, but that other mens faith may; for as (I then ſaid) Our Lord prayed not for the faith of every particular man, but now being of a better and more ſound Iudgment according to that which Chriſt teacheth in plaine words, Ioh.</hi> 17. 20. <hi>I pray not for theſe alone, that is the Apoſtles, but for them alſo which ſhall believe in mee through their word; I acknowledge that Chriſt prayed for the faith of every particular believer, and that by the vertue of that prayer of Chriſt; every true believer is ſo ſtayd up, that his faith cannot faile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly touching perſeverance to to the end, I ſaid that, that certainty concerning the time to come is proud, for as much as it is in his owne nature contingent of what kind the perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of every man is, neither did I affirme it to be proud only, but to be moſt wicked; but now I freely proteſt that the true and juſtifiing faith, whereby the faithfull are moſt neare united unto Chriſt, is ſo firme as alſo for the time to come ſo certaine, that it can never be rooted up out of the mindes of the faithfull by any temptation of the fleſh, the world or divell himſelfe; ſo that he that once hath this faith ſhall ever have it; for by the benefit of that juſtifying faith Chriſt dwelleth in us and we in Chriſt, therefore it cannot but be both increaſed (Chriſt growing in us dayly) as alſo perſevere unto the end, becauſe God doth give conſtancy.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly, I affirmed that there was no diſtinction in faith, but in the Perſons believing, in which I confeſſe I did erre.

His words are theſe, <hi>God's election &amp; Reprobation is moſt free, of his owne will, not upon the foreſight of the merits of either of them; for he hath mercy on whom he will and whom he will he hardeneth verſ:</hi> 18. Yet here is to be diſtinguiſhed, for the explication of the truth, That God's decree of Reprobation may be conſidered either as touching the Act of God reprobating and willing, or as touching the things hereby willed or Decreed; As touching the Act of God reprobating, we ſay as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith concerning the Act of God predeſtinating, namely that no cauſe can be given thereof as from man, like as no cauſe can be given of God's will; God's will being eternall, but whatſoever is in man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Temporall. But as touching the things decreed or willed by Reprobation, theſe are either the deniall of grace, or inflicting of damnation; As touching the deniall of grace we clearely profeſſe, that like as God of his mere will and pleaſure doth ſhew mercy on ſome in beſtowing the grace of faith and repentance upon them; ſo God of his mere will and pleaſure doth harden others in denying unto them the grace of ſaith and repentance; and thus it is that Doctor Fulke maintaines God's election &amp; reprobation to be moſt free of his owne free will, not upon the foreſight of the merits of either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but touching the inflicting of damnation, we maintaine that God neither doth inflict damnation, nor ever did decree to inflict damnation of his owne mere pleaſure and will, but altogether for ſinne, either originall or actuall: further we maintaine, that in no moment of time or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture God doth decree to damne any man before he foreſeeth the ſinne for which they ſhall be damned. 2. As touching the ſecond we willingly grant, that by vertue of God's decree, it neceſſarily and unavoidably followes, that whoſoever dieth in finall impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhall be damned, neither doe I thinke this Authour dares to avouch the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as touching finall impenitency, wee willingly profeſſe that upon ſuppoſition of God's decree finally to harden a man and to deny a man the grace of repentance: (It being clearely the gift of God as Scriptures teſtifie. Act: 5. 31, and 11. 18. 2 Tim 2 25) it is impoſſible that ſuch a man ſhould repent, nevertheleſſe both repentance is poſſible, and finall impenitency is avoidable ſimply (to wit) by grace 3. But this Authour loves not to explicate himſelfe, but I ſuppoſe he ſecretly maintaines, that every man hath ſuch a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by grace, wherby he may repent if he will, concerning which Tenent of his, we nothing doubt but every man hath ſuch a power, but we deny that ſuch a power is grace; we ſay it is nature rather, and that for this reaſon; looke by what power a man may repent if he will, by the ſame power he may ref uſe to repent if he will: Now if this were grace, then were grace inferior to a morall vertue: for no morall vertue leaves a man indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to doe good or no; to doe good or evill; but inclines and diſpoſeth the will only to that which is good; ſo Juſtice diſpoſeth a man only to juſt actions, not indifferentlie to that which is juſt, or to that which is unjuſt, Tis true never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe a man that is juſt may doe an unjuſt Act if he will, but this is not by vertue of the habit of Juſtice wherewith he is qualified; But only by reaſon of the freedome of his will wich is naturall unto him; for juſtice undoubtedly inclines a man's will only to that which appeareth juſt, and ſo every morall vertue inclines the will only to a vertuous Act, not indifferently either to acts vertuous, or to acts vicious; like as on the contrary a vicious habit inclines the will of man only to acts vicious, not indifferently, to acts vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or to acts vertuous! Secondly grace is ſupernaturall, it were a Monſter in Divinitie to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56120:169"/>
ſay that ſupernaturall grace doth indifferently incline a man either to good or evill; it is impoſſible it ſhould incline a man ſave to acts ſupernaturall; now every ſupernaturall act muſt needs be gratious, it cannot be ſinfull or evill; laſtly whoſoever hath a willto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ſuch a one hath not only a power to repent, but actually doth repent, as touching the cheifeſt facultiein, the change whereof repentance doth conſiſt; for that is the will, and it is God that worketh in us both the will and the deed, in every kind of that which is truly good; and ſurely to have a will to repent is a good thing, if he want power, let him and us, pray for that out of that will and deſirewe have to repent, <hi>ut quod volumus implere valeamus, that what we deſire to doe we may be able to doe,</hi> and we have no cauſe to feare that God will deſpiſe ſo gratious deſires.</p>

His diſtinction is very well knowne of will abſolute and will conditionall; which will conditionate he examplifies thus, as when God will have ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation conferred upon a man in caſe he doth believe; what one of our Divines doth deny a conditionall will, in this ſenſe in reference to ſalvation? Now what one of the Antients (the Pelagians excepted) can this Authour produce; that doth affirme any ſuch will to be in God, for the beſtowing of faith upon a man? For to maintaine this, were in plaine Termes to maintaine, that it was the will of God that grace ſhould beſtowed according unto workes: But if the grace of God be beſtowed merely according to the good pleaſure of God, as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith; <hi>God hath mercy on whom he will?</hi> By this it is aparent, that this decree is abſolute, and conſequently that predeſtination is abſolute; And thus <hi>Auſtine</hi> coupleth together the doctrine of the beſtowing grace not according unto workes, And his Doctrine of predeſtination as inſeparable, each to be granted or denied together with the other. Becauſe this Authour pretends it to be needles to cite <hi>Auſtine,</hi> and ſufficient to cite <hi>Proſper,</hi> adding that <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſpeakes in him, to wit, after he was Dead; ſuch is this Authours jugling courſe with his Reader; therefore I will repreſent <hi>Auſtine</hi> himſelfe propoſing the objection made by the <hi>Maſſilienſes,</hi> againſt <hi>Auſtin's</hi> doctrine of prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, as it was ſent unto him by <hi>Proſper,</hi> and then anſwering it, not leaving it unto <hi>Proſper</hi> to anſwer for him: See the objection, <hi>ſed aiunt (ut ſcribitis) neminem poſſe corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptionis ſtimulis excitari, ſi dicatur in conventu Eceleſiae audientibus multis, It a ſe habet de praedeſtinatione definita ſententia voluntatis Dei, ut alii ex vobis de infidelitate, accepta obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endi voluntate, veneritis ad fidem, vel accepta perſeverantia maneatis in fide &amp;c.

                     <hi>in the hearing of many, ſuch as touching predeſtination is the determinate ſentence of the will of God, that ſome of you receiving an obedient will, ſhall come from infidelitie unto faith, or receiving perſeverance ſhall continue in the faith: But the reſt, who continue in ſinfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, therefore you have not riſen, becauſe the ſuccour of commiſerant grace, hath not as yet raiſed you.

And as for thoſe that doe obey, if you are not predeſtinated to be Elect, the ſtrength of obedience ſhall be withdrawne that you may ceaſe to obey:</hi> Thus farre the objection, <hi>Auſtin's</hi> anſwer followeth thus; <hi>When theſe things are ſaid, they ought not to to deterre us, from confeſſing God's grace (to wit) which is not given according unto workes, and from confeſſing predeſtination according thereunto; like as we are not terrified from confeſſing God's foreknowledge, if a man ſhould diſcourſe thereof in this manner before the people; whether now ye live well or not well, ſuch ſhall ye be hereafter, as God foreſees ye will be, either good, if he foreſees ye will be good; or evill, if he foreſees he will be evill: for what if upon the hearing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome give themſelves to ſloth, and from labour prone to luſt goe after their concupiſences; ſhall we therefore conceive that to be falſe which was delivered concerning God's foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi> And ſo he proceeds to juſtifie the truth of this doctrine which was objected againſt him by way of Crimination, I ſay to juſtifie it as touching the ſubſtance of it, though as touching the manner of propoſing it, he confeſſeth that to be unreaſonably harſh in ſome particulars; and ſhewes how that may be propoſed in a more decent manner, ſtill hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up the ſame truth, Thus <hi>Auſtine</hi> was able to anſwere for himſelfe, whileſt he was living; Now let us conſider how <hi>Proſper</hi> anſwers for him after he was dead. And firſt let us conſider the objection it ſelfe; now it is this, <hi>That they who are not predeſtinate unto life, although they live piouſly and righteouſly, it ſhall nothing profit them, but they ſhall be reſerved ſo long untill they periſh:</hi> Now this is painely a part of the objection made by the <hi>Maſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienſes</hi> and they were <hi>Galli,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">And it is ſometimes more harſhly propoſed by the Maſſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſes then by the Galli.</note> whom <hi>Proſper</hi> anſwereth, for the objection propoſed to <hi>Auſtine</hi> was, that, <hi>ſtrength of obedience ſhould be taken from them;</hi> But in the objection of the <hi>Galli,</hi> whom <hi>Proſper</hi> anſweres it is ſet dowe in a milder manner, thus, <hi>They ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved untill they periſh.</hi> Now <hi>Auſtine</hi> himſelfe accomodates his anſwer hereunto in particular, <hi>De bono Perſeverantiae, cap.</hi> 22. 1 For ſhewing the unreaſonable harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſein this manner of propoſing it: <hi>I wonder</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if any weak man in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people can by any meanes heare with patience that which followes; as namely when it is ſaid unto them, yee that doe obey, if ye be predeſtinated to be rejected, the ſtrength of obedience ſhall be withdrawne from you that you may ceaſe to obey; For thus to ſpeake what ſeemeth it to be other, then to curſe or to propheſie evill after a ſort;</hi> Then he proceeds to ſhe whow the ſame truth may be delivered in a fairer manner, ſtill holding up the truth of the doctrine of predeſtination; <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a man thinke good to ſpeake ſomething of ſuch as doe not perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and need be ſo to doe. What failes of the truth of this ſentence if it be delivered thus? But if ſome doe obey, that are not predeſtinated unto the kingdome and to glorie; they are temporarie ones, and ſhall not perſevere in the ſame obedience unto the end.</hi> Then he proceeds to ſhew how the ſame objection may be framed againſt God's praeſcience, thus; <hi>Et ſi qui obeditis, ſi prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciti eſtis, rejiciendi obedire ceſſabtis; If any of you doe obey, if with all ye are foreſeen to be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ye ſhall ceaſe to obey,</hi> whereby ye may obſerve, how Auſtine in framing the objection, leaves out the Phraſe <hi>of withdrawing the ſtrength of obedience,</hi> as containing a calumnious imputation, and ſuch as <hi>Auſtine</hi> had nothing to doe with in the courſe of his opinion concerning predeſtination. Thus <hi>Auſtine</hi> hath plainely anſwered for himſelfe, and needs noe other to anſwer for him, and his anſwer proceeds without all colour of prejudice to his owne doctrine, concerning the abſoluteneſſe of predeſtination By this let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge of the ingenuitie of this Authour, who conceales all this from his Reader, bearing him in hand, that <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſpeakes in <hi>Proſper</hi> making anſwere to his objection, whereas indeed there is a vaſt difference between <hi>Proſper's</hi> anſwer for <hi>Auſtine,</hi> and <hi>Auſtin's</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for himſelfe: But like enough <hi>Proſper</hi> was willing to condeſcend to the <hi>Galli,</hi> * and to gratifie them with an anſwer, that in his judgment might be more acceptable and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorie unto them; To the conſideration whereof I now proceed, and therein to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Proſper,</hi> not <hi>Auſtin's</hi> mind, concerning predeſtination, as which he hath ſufficiently manifeſted in anſwer to the ſame objection, as I have ſhewed; <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith <hi>Proſper) They are not predeſtinated, becauſe they were foreſeen to be ſuch hereafter by their voluntarie praevarication,</hi> what will follow herence? That foreſight of ſinnes was the cauſe why they were not predeſtinated unto life? I anſwere, firſt by denying this conſequence, for it may as well follow that the Creatours love is the cauſe why ſinnes are forgiven him, for

the Goſpell ſaith of the woman, <hi>Luk:</hi> the 7. <hi>Therefore many ſinnes are forgiven her, becauſe ſhe loved much;</hi> ſuch illations are not alwaies cauſall, but very often merely rationall. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, let it be cauſall, and that foreſight of ſinne is the cauſe of non predeſtination un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life, and accordingly of predeſtination unto damnation, yet here I have a double an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Firſt it is the moſt generall opinion, that reprobation as it ſignifies a purpoſe to damne, and accordingly to exclude from heaven, preſuppoſeth the preſcience of ſinne: M. <hi>Perkins</hi> expreſly profeſſeth as much, and other Divines at the Synod of Dort; yet this hinders not the abſoluteneſſe of <hi>reprobation,</hi> which appeares in the purpoſe of God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grace, and that abſolutely to ſome, like as he beſtowes it upon others; I meane the grace of faith and regeneration; otherwiſe grace ſhould be given according to workes: Now let any paſſage be produced out of <hi>Proſper,</hi> or any other Orthodox writer among'ſt the Antients to ſhew, that God in diſtributing theſe graces unto ſome, and denying them unto others, did not proceed abſolutely, but according unto workes; and according to this doctrine, it is well knowne that <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſhaped his doctrine concerning predeſtination, as it hath been ſhewed at large in the anſwer to M. <hi>Hord,</hi> in the firſt ſection; ſecondly that there may be a cauſe of predeſtination and reprobation, <hi>Aquinas</hi> doth not deny, but how? <hi>quoad res volitas, as touching things willed,</hi> or, <hi>praedeſtinatione &amp; reprobatione praepartas, by predeſtination and reprobation prepared,</hi> and in this ſenſe <hi>Aquinas</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth that, foreſight of ſinne is the cauſe of reprobation, the nineth to the Romans; &amp; ſee how he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicates himſelfe, his wordes are theſe, <hi>Lect:</hi> 3. <hi>praeſcientia peccatorum poteſt eſſe aliqua ratio reprobationis ex parte poenae quae preparatur Reprobatis: in quantum ſcil: Deus proponit ſe puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turum malos propter peccata quae à ſe ipſis habent, non à Deo. The foreſight of ſinnes may be ſome reaſon of reprobation as touching the puniſhment, which is prepared for Reprobates, in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as God decreeth to puniſh wicked men for their ſinnes, which they have of themſelves, not of God:</hi> But of reprobation, as touching the act of God reprobating, there can be noe more cauſe thereof, then there can be a cauſe of God's will as touching the act of God willing. And upon this very ground it is, that <hi>Aquinas</hi> profeſſeth that * <hi>never any man was ſo mad as to affirme that there may be a cauſe given of predeſtination, as touching the</hi>

                  <p>This Authour grants <hi>Remigius</hi> to be a Patron of abſolute reprobation: But theſe <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> words of his, this Authour ſaith, cannot ſtand with abſolute Reprobation: <hi>Remigius</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly thought they could; otherwiſe he muſt have renounced the Doctrine of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute reprobation and the Patronage thereof, which yet he did not; as this Authour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knoledgeth: Now is it enough for this Authour, to ſay that theſe words cannot ſtand with abſolute Reprobation and barely to ſay it, without proving ought? and truely I have found ſuch to be the imperious carriage of this Authour in manuſcript, now I ſee it in print; But let us endeavour to cleare <hi>Remigius,</hi> by proving the Contrary:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56120:172"/>
indevour to cleare <hi>Remigius,</hi> by proving the contrary. Therefore it is well knowne that the Terme <hi>abſolute</hi> ſtand's in oppoſition to <hi>Conditionall.</hi> Now this diſtinction of will abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and will Conditionall <hi>Gerardus Voſſius</hi> doth accommodate in reſpect of the things willed of God, and gives inſtance of God's will of ſaving, which he ſaith is conditionall: foraſmuch as God purpoſeth not to beſtow ſalvation on any, but ſuch as believe, faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by God's <hi>ordinance</hi> the Condition of obtaining Salvation. In like ſort Doctor <hi>Iackson</hi> in his book of <hi>Providence</hi> acknowledgeth the diſtinction of <hi>voluntas antecedens,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequens</hi> is to be underſtood not on the part of God willing, but on the part of things willed: Now the things willed in the decree of Reprobation, are two, contrary to things willed in Election: For as in Election God doth will the conferring of grace, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of ſalvation; ſoe in Reprobation God doth will the deniall of grace and inflicting of damnation: Now <hi>Remigius</hi> in the paſſages here produced, ſpeakes altogether of God's will to inflict damnation, and he denies that God's will is to inflict damnation on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man abſolutely, but only conditionally (to wit) in caſe of finall perſeverance in ſinne, and ſo ſay we with <hi>Remigius:</hi> But as touching God's will to deny grace, we utterly deny that God will have grace to be denied upon a condition, for nothing can be deviſed to be the condition thereof, but ſinne either originall or actuall. And if upon ſuch a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grace ſhould be denied, it ſhould be denied to all ſeeing before grace is given, all are found to be under ſinne actuall or originall, and conſequently all ſhould be Reprobates, even every mothers ſonne. 2. And if to avoid this, it be ſaid: although all be ſinners, yet grace is denyed to none, but ſuch as want a certaine particular obedience; Then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the performing of that obedience grace ſhould be conferred; this is as much as to ſay that <hi>Grace is conferred according unto workes;</hi> which doctrine hath ever been abominated by the Orthodox in oppoſition unto the Pelagians. Now the Apoſtle clearely makes for us in this, profeſſing that <hi>God hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.</hi> Now though there paſſages produced out of <hi>Remigius</hi> carrie ſome ſhew againſt abſolute reprobation from glorie, or unto damnation; yet have they noe colour or ſhew of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing abſolute reprobation from grace; As for neceſſitie of periſhing, that is merely condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall (to wit) in caſe of finall continuance in ſinne without repentance; And as for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of ſinning, that we confeſſe is found in all, in ſtate of nature, <hi>Corvinus</hi> confeſſeth it to be the doctrine of <hi>Arminius</hi> that, <hi>all men naturally are caſt upon a neceſſitie of ſinning.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">In anſwer to charity miſtaken.</note> And Doctor <hi>Potter</hi> propoſeth it as the doctrine of the Church of England, that, in a naturall man there is no <hi>libertas a peccato, libertie from ſinning;</hi> which yet is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood aright, not but that it is in his power to abſtaine from any particular ſinfull act; for no ſupernaturall act is or can be ſinfull, every ſinfull act muſt needs be an act naturall; and power either to doe or to abſtaine from any naturall Act, is not to be denied to any naturall man. But it is impoſſible that any naturall man ſhould abſtaine from any ſinne, or doe any naturall good act (ſo commonly accounted) in a gratious manner, untill grace comes, ſo to ſeaſon the heart of man as to love God, even to the contempt of himſelfe, and out of his love to doe that good which he doth, and to abſtaine from that evill, from which he abſtaineth. 2. But if the queſtion be of the manner how this neceſſitie of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is brought upon the nature of man; we ſay, it is not by the pleaſure of God: But by the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom:</hi> 5. <hi>By one man ſinne entred into the world, and death by ſinne:</hi> for man by reaſon of ſinne was juſtly bereaved of the Spirit of God, and begetting children in this Condition, he begets them after his owne Image and likeneſſe, that is bereaved of the Spirit of God. And we hold it impoſſible for a man bereaved of God's Spirit, either to doe that which is good, or abſtaine from doing that which is evill in a gratious manner.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, I come to the Synod of Valenſe, when they ſay, <hi>the wicked not periſh becauſe they could not doe good, but becauſe they would not.</hi> Theſe words may ſeeme to imply that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the wicked <hi>could doe good if they would;</hi> and truely I ſee noe cauſe to deny this: But that we may ſafely ſay with <hi>Auſtine;</hi> that, <hi>omnes poſſunt Deo credere &amp; ab amore rerum tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralium ad divina praecepta ſervanda ſe convertere, ſi velint:</hi> Believe God if they will, and from the love of all things temporall convert themſelves to the keeping of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements if they will; for if a man would goe to Church but cannot, becauſe he is lame, would read in God's word, but cannot, becauſe he is blind: Theſe impotencies are naturall not morall: but the impotency brought upon mankind by the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> is morall not naturall. Now morall impotency is found noe where but in the will, or at leaſt is chiefly there, and ſecondly in the underſtanding alſo, as touching knowledge pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall; and accordingly when Scriptures teſtifie that they who are in the fleſh cannot

And that after that manner which they had ſet downe in their Theſes and writings exhibited to the Synod; hereupon the Sinod to give them ſatisfaction herein ordered, that their opinion not only concerning Election, but alſo concerning reprobation ſhould be weighed and examined: ſoe far forth as they in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhould judge to be ſufficient, for the glory of God, for the edifying and quieting of the Church and all mens conſciences; but as touching the manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding herein, it perteyned to them to conſider and ordeine as they thought good. And it became not thoſe who where cited to appear, to preſcribe unto the Sinod. This decree being read the 40 ſeſſion conteynes the altercation here abouts, betweene the Synod and them. They forſooth would preſcribe to the Synod, <hi>de modo agendi;</hi> The Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod muſt not unto them.</p>
                  <p>The Synod hereupon intreates the judgment of forrain divines. And they all with one conſent profeſſe that the Synod had granted the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> as much libertie for the defence of their cauſe, as in Equitie could be granted and could well ſtand with the honour of the Synod. And therefore there is no cauſe why the decree of the Synod ſhould be altered, or why the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> ſhould complaine or decline the Authority of the <hi>Synod;</hi> that nothing was put upon them burthen ſome to their conſciences: And therefore it was in vaine to pretend ſcruples of Conſcience, as in the Seſſion 42 there is a repreſentation made of their unreaſonable demaund; namely in the firſt place to deale upon reprobation &amp;c: whereupon the opinion of forrain divines was required; as whether it was fit to yeild unto them in this, and to treat of reprobation before they treated of Election, who declared by concurring ſuffrages that courſe (propoſed by them) to be moſt unreaſonable: now let the reader judge how unſhamefaſt that cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is, which this Author chargeth that Synod with, and conſequently all the the forreine divines therein aſſembled, who juſtified thoſe Synodicall proceedings with their unanimous conſent. Surely this Author hath an high opinion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his owne ſufficiencies, who thinkes this Bolt of his ſoone ſhot, more worth then the concurrent verdict of all thoſe divines, Choſen as eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by their ſeverall Churches, and ſentunto that Sinod from many places of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome. Now hee who in the progreſſe of his unſhamefaſt diſcourſe, ſpares not thus to Taxe a Synod and all the forrain Divines that aſſembled therein, no mervell if he forbeare not to charge the <hi>Contra Remonſtrants</hi> in the Hague confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the ſame Crimination, though never ſo injuriouſly; Thus indeede the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> in the Synod of Dort, Criminate their adverſaries as appeares in the <hi>Synodalia Dodcacena pag:</hi> 136. In the conference at Hague the <hi>Contra-Remonſtrants</hi> deprecated that they might not be put to deale on Reprobation, and more at large pag: 159. in the ſame writings; We reade how <hi>Feſtus Hommius</hi> one of the <hi>Contra-Remonſtrants</hi> in that conference at the Hague, hereupon ſtood up, <hi>Expoſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itque paucis quod non bona fide haec de illis dicerentur,</hi> how unfaithfully this relation was made, <hi>ſe libello ſupplice non fuiſſe deprecatos ne de reprobatione ageretur;</hi> That they did not in their ſupplication intreat that no diſputation ſhould be had of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therewithall the truth of the matter as formerly I have ſet downe in anſwear to the former diſcourſe, and as for Beza in the conferrence with <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobus Andreas</hi> in the point of predeſtination: It is true at the firſt motion he decly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, and he gives his reaſons, 1. namely that thy were not called by the prince of Mompelgard to diſpute on this Article but on another which was expreſſed in the princes letters, as <hi>Iacobus Andreas</hi> acknowledgeth: 2 and accordingly they had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from their Church that ſent them, to diſpute on that whereunto they were called and not on any other. 3. and ſoe they came provided to diſpute on that which was expreſſed in the Princes letters who invited them. 4. Then againe it was in a <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> aſſembly. 5. neither would <hi>Andeas</hi> yeild to <hi>Beza's</hi> motions that the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence might be tranſacted by writing. 6. nor that which was to be delivered by them ſhould be taken by notaries. 7. Yet they offered to propoſe their doctrine on that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument before the Prince, and to heare what <hi>Jacobus Andreas</hi> had to ſay againſt it and promiſed to returne him an anſwer thereunto; Thirdly, conſider it was not predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone, whereof they were unwilling at that time and in that place to conferre about, But two other Articles alſo, namely as concerning Baptiſme, and Images in Churches; why then, doth not this Author plead as well for Images in Churches, as for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall nature of reprobation: as well he may upon the ſame ground? Fourthly, what
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56120:173"/>
ſottiſhneſſe poſſeſſeth this Authour to conclude, that becauſe <hi>Beza</hi> at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a place, and upon ſuch and ſuch tearmes, did refuſe to diſpute thereon; Therefore all that profeſſe the ſame doctrine with <hi>Beza</hi> doe refuſe to come to triall there abouts, and conſequently that doctrine is ſuſpectable of untruth; whereas it cannot be concluded of <hi>Beza</hi> ſimply that he refuſed to come to a triall, becauſe once at a certaine time and in a certaine place, and in a conference upon certaine termes he did refuſe to come to a tryall: For my part, I refuſe not to come to a triall with any of them upon any particular: But I noe way thinke fit to entertaine a conferrence here about by wordes of mouth, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by writing; ſo it will be more quietly carried, ſo it will be more free from aliene diſcourſe; ſo each party ſhall have time both duely to weigh the Adverſaries Argument and with due conſideration to put in his anſwer thereunto; And is it not farre more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent that the holy things of God ſhould be handled premeditately, rather then ſubitane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly? Fiſtly, what if <hi>Beza</hi> were of opinion that God hath choſen ſome unto eternall life, and paſſed by others without any reſpect had to the perſonall goodneſſe of the one, or naughtineſſe of the other, and that this is Saint <hi>Paule's</hi> doctrine, <hi>Rom:</hi> 9. This was Saint <hi>Auſtin's</hi> opinion alſo as <hi>Voſſius</hi> acknowledgeth in his hiſtorie of <hi>Pelagian hereſies p.</hi> 655. Now will any man thinke him well in his wits who diſcourſeth after this manner; ſurely <hi>Auſtin's</hi> doctrine concerning election and reprobation is ſuſpectable of untruth; Becauſe <hi>Beza</hi> maintaining the ſame doctrine ſome 1200 yeares after, was unwilling to come to a tryall thereabouts at a certaine time in a certaine place, namely at <hi>Mompelgard</hi> before the Duke of <hi>Wirtenberg?</hi> Laſtly, obſerve the ſtrange inconſiderations of this Authour; for the Authour of the former diſcourſe promiſed the Gentleman his friend to whom he wrote, to give him the reaſon of his change in opinion, not in this point only of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in the other points alſo, for he perceived he was become an <hi>Arminian:</hi> Now whereas he gives him the reaſon of his change in one point only, declining all the reſt, doth he not manifeſt his unwillingneſſe to deale on all the other 4 points? And may not wee conclude after this Authours manner, that this betrayes no ſmall ſuſpicion, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely his cauſe is weak and ill grounded in all the reſt? In like manner doth this <hi>Acha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> carry himſelfe, he that helps of the other to make his taske for him. It is his uſuall courſe to deale only upon the point of reprobation, as in this place; ſo in a writing of his to a certaine Scholer, and as I have ſeen under his hand; It ſeemes he is well conceited of his ſufficiencie on this point: And truely I am very glad to ſee what he can ſay for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, even on the point of reprobation That which followes is to little purpoſe, ſave to ſhew the <hi>plerofphorie</hi> of his common place-book: and how eaſily it is for him to abound, not only in things neceſſary, but in things unneceſſary alſo: Therefore he tells us what <hi>Cicero</hi> writes of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> which may with a farre better grace be retorted upon himſelfe then upon <hi>Beza,</hi> or the <hi>Contra-Remonſtrants</hi> at the Hague conferrence; or the Fathers of Dort, how unfacetiouſly it is applyed unto them I have already ſhewed, and further it is well knowne both by <hi>Calvins,</hi> and <hi>Beza's</hi> writings, and by that which was done in the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort,</hi> ſet forth to the veiwe of all the world, that they have not concealed their opinions from the world on thoſe points controverted; All that are able to read and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Latine, may ſoone come accquainted with them: And M. <hi>Hord</hi> dealing only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reprobation which is but a part of one of the five Articles, and forbearing to meddle with Election or any other of the five, contrary to the promiſe made by him unto his friend, doth he not hereby bewray conſciouſneſſe of his owne inſufficiencie to meddle thereon? And like enough he hath learned this wiſedome from his Abettor (and this is his courſe) who loves to deale in hugger mugger, and ſets others on worke, contented to blowe the coales; yet walkes gloriouſly at the light of his owne fire, and the ſparkes that he hath kindled, vaunting (as I heare) that his peece cannot be anſwered, and in ſuch termes he commends it unto the Country.</p>
                  <p>In like manner let the indifferent Reader judge, whether, that which he produceth out of <hi>Lodovicus Vives</hi> be more againſt us, then againſt the Authour himſelfe that produceth it; for both <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> and generally our Divines have publiquely profeſſed their opinions, not on predeſtination only, but on reprobation alſo, and upon all other points controverted between us and the <hi>Arminians;</hi> whereas this Auhour ſculkes and pulls in his hornes as if he dared not to be ſeen on other points; only declares himſelfe upon the point of reprobation; I meane M. <hi>Horde;</hi> but as for the other which blowes quick-ſilver into him, he is loath to be knowne, as if his occupation were with <hi>Bronteſ<expan>

                     <p>And to ſay on thing more, beſides this infamy among Chriſtians, it is very probable that among the too many ſcandals given to the <hi>Jewes</hi> by <hi>Chriſtians</hi> among whom they dwell; This doctrine is not on of the <note place="margin">

For they thinke it a bad opinion (ſaith the ſame judicious and learned Gentleman) which ſome of great name have ſeemed to hold, that God in his everlaſting and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute pleaſure ſhould affect the extreame miſerie of any of his Creatures, for the ſhewing of his juſtice and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veritie in tormenting them, or that the calamitie, caſting a way and damnation of ſome, ſhould abſolutely and neceſſarily redound more to his glorie then the felicitie of them all, conſidering that his nature is mere goodneſſe and happineſſe, and hath noe affinity with rigour and miſery.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>As touching this paticular of M. <hi>Moulyn:</hi> I have addreſſed an anſwer puctually <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> thereunto in my <hi>Vindiciae</hi> amongſt my degreſſions touching predeſtination, yet I am content to ſay ſomething concerning the point it ſelfe and his judgment thereupon. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation hath two parts, which this Authour moſt judiciouſly confounds, the one is God's decree to deny grace, the other is his decree to inflict damnation; As touching the firſt, the very execution thereof proceeds merely according to God's pleaſure, howmuch more the decree it ſelfe, which is eternall, and cannot poſſibly have any precedaneous thereunto; whereas the execution is temporall, and temporall things may have ſomewhat
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56120:174"/>
precedaneous thereunto. Now that the execution thereof is merely according to God's good pleaſure is apparent; the execution thereof being no other then the denyall of grace; And as God of his mere pleaſure gives faith and repentance to whom he will; ſo of his mere pleaſure he denies it unto others; otherwiſe grace ſhould be conferred according unto workes, which was condemned in the Synod of <hi>Paleſtine, Pelagius</hi> himſelfe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing thereunto above 1200 yeares agoe, and all along afterwards it was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in divers Synods gatherd together for ſuppreſſing of the <hi>Pelagian Hereſie.</hi> Now did M. <hi>Moulin</hi> think it noe wiſe part to publiſh this doctrine, That grace is not given accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto workes; but according to the mere pleaſure of God? Nothing leſſe; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> plainly profeſſing that <hi>God hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will, he hardeneth.</hi> Come we to reprobation as it ſignifies God's decree to inflict damnation without conſideration of ſinne, our adverſaries would faine ſhape our opinions thus, and none more eager this way, then this Authour, I meane him that is thought to be the ſuggeſter at firſt, and ſince the <hi>Interpolator</hi> and <hi>Promotor</hi> of all this; But this is a moſt notorious untruth; nay how can we maintaine this, who imbrace the definition of reprobation given by <hi>Aquinas,</hi> where he ſaith, that <hi>repobation includes a will to permit ſinne, and to inferre damnation for ſinne,</hi> ſo doth M. <hi>Perkins,</hi> and him have I juſtified againſt <hi>Arminius</hi> in my <hi>Vindiciae;</hi> And not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of our Divines doth maintaine that God intends to damne any man but for ſinne, and finall perſeverance therein without repentance. And the former point concerning the firſt act of reprobation, being granted, which neither Sir <hi>Edwin Sandes,</hi> nor any <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> that I know, denies; the doctrine concerning this latter act of reprobation will be found to containe noe difficultie at all, foraſmuch as we utterly deny that God either doth inflict, or ever did decree to inflict damnation according to his mere pleaſure; but merely for finall continuance in ſinne without repentance. Now let every ſober Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſider, whether there be any harſhneſſe in all this: But as M. <hi>Moulin</hi> diſcourſeth here, ſo did the <hi>Maſſilienſes</hi> of old concerning <hi>Auſtin's</hi> doctrine, as which they would not have at all broached, as appeares in the Epiſtle of <hi>Proſper.—</hi>Yet I commend this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour for his ingenuous confeſſion, that the ſame may be ſaid of the <hi>Sublapſarian</hi> way. But to our prejudice he tells us that Sir <hi>Ed: Sandes</hi> is of the ſame mind, and therefore conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the excellencie of the booke, written by him, whereunto we may adde the excellencie of the diſcourſe written by this Authour; let us for the credit and tranſcendent ſufficiencie of theſe two, renounce not <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> only, (poore Snakes as they were) but the whole <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort;</hi> and all the outlandiſh divines aſſembled there, and manifeſting their concurrance in opinion with thoſe <hi>Synodicall Divines,</hi> yea and <hi>Fulke</hi> and <hi>Whitaker,</hi> and the <hi>Univerſitie</hi> of <hi>Cambridge</hi> as they were then affected, when they drave <hi>Barret</hi> to a recantation; Yet Sir <hi>Edwin Sandes</hi> in the place produced, betraies not his owne judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but makes relation of the bitterneſſe of <hi>Lutherans</hi> in oppoſing <hi>Calviniſts:</hi> In like manner both <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> did oppoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> even unto bloud, for preaching <hi>Chriſt</hi> crucified, which was a ſcandall to the one, fooliſhneſſe unto the other. And ſhall the truth of <hi>Chriſtianitie</hi> be any whit the worſe thought of for this? why then ſhall our Doctrine of predeſtination and reprobation be ſuſpected as untrue, becauſe the <hi>Lutheran</hi> partie, doe alſo bitterly oppoſe it? eſpecially conſidering, that we with <hi>Auſtine</hi> no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe maintaine predeſtination then as it depends and is grounded upon this, that grace is not given according unto workes, as <hi>Auſtine</hi> profeſſeth to have been his opinion, <hi>de bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no perſeverantiae, cap.</hi> 14. And we are ready to renounce whatſoever contradicteth this: and the <hi>Lutherans</hi> themſelves profeſſe concurrently with us, that grace is not given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto workes. And by the way obſerve the <hi>Lutheran</hi> ſpleen is exerciſed not only againſt the predeſtinary peſtilence, (as they call it) but the Sacramentarie peſtilence alſo. That is, againſt their doctrine who oppoſe their ubiquitie and conſubſtantiation, yet in the very next page the ſame Knight affirmes, that all the <hi>Lutherans</hi> are not carried with the ſame ſterne humour, but they only who are called <hi>Lutherani rigidi,</hi> &amp; that the greater part perhaps which are the <hi>molles Lutherani,</hi> are quiet enough, neither accompt they otherwiſe of the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> then as of erring brethren; whom the <hi>rigids</hi> have (as is ſaid) threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to excomunicate as <hi>Schiſmitiques</hi> and <hi>Heretiques.—</hi>3 The <hi>Grecians</hi> are ſaid to oppoſe the doctrine of <hi>Calvin</hi> in the point of predeſtination; yet we know our Engliſh Divines ſubſcribed unto the ſame Doctrine in the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort;</hi> together with all the forraigne Divines there aſſembled, and the ſumme therof is but this, that God, both in the election of ſome, and preterition of others, had noe reſpect to the perſonall goodneſſe of the one, and perſonall naughtineſſe of the other. And that this was the very doctrine of <hi>Auſtine,</hi> and of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo in the opinion of <hi>Auſtine, Voſſius</hi> acknowledeth, and <hi>Auſtine</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth

Concerning the Jewes, this doctrine of ours, this judicious (not Sir <hi>Edwin Sandes)</hi> thinks it probable that doth hinder their converſation: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that learned Knight doth profeſſe, that they are oppoſite to the doctrine here reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this Authour, and in the ſame ſentence he profeſſeth them in like manner oppoſite to our doctrine, in maintaining that the divell and his Angells ſhall be caſt into everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting fire; for thus goes Sir <hi>Edwin's</hi> relation, <hi>as they thinke it a bad opinion which ſome men ſeeme to hold, that God in his everlaſting and abſolute power ſhould affect the extreame miſerie of any of his Creatures as here it lyes, ſo contrarie wiſe, they think with Origen, that Hell in the ende ſhall utterly be aboliſhed; and that the divells themſelves after a long courſe of bitter repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and puniſhment ſhall find mercy at his handes, that did create them:</hi> But as touching our difference from this in this particular; This Authour doth not expreſſe ought ſo much as probable, to hinder their converſion; as touching the former he hath; for that ſerved his turne, this doth not, and his wit and wiſedome being ſo nere of kinne, noe mervaile if he makes the one to performe ſervice of love to the other But let me ſay ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the opinion it ſelfe here related, as in the firſt place; That God doth not effect the extreame miſery of his creatures in his abſolute pleaſure, what is the doctrine oppoſite hereunto but this, namely that God decrees to damne no man but for ſinne, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his abſolute pleaſure? Now what one of our Divines was ever knowne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict this; and to affirme that God intends to damne many of his creatures not for their ſinnes, but of his owne abſolute pleaſure? for my part I never read any that maintained this: But we generally ſay that God in electing ſome and paſſing by others, as touching the conferring of grace, proceeded and decreed, and that from everlaſting to proceed, not according to mens workes, but according to his abſolute pleaſure; now this was <hi>Auſtin's</hi> judgment as well as ours; and Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> too, in the opinion of <hi>Auſtine,</hi> as <hi>Voſſius</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth in the place formerly cited.

efficient cauſe admits farther diſtinction; for it is either Phyſicall or Morall: Phyſicall is that which really workes or executes any thing: as every tradeſman hath his worke, which his hands doe make; ſo God hath his worke, which he executes, and his worke is <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

A Morall efficient is twofold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only of a moveing nature, to move others to doe ſomewhat; as namely either by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading, or by meriting or deſerving: He that perſwades <q>moves an other to doe ſome what; he that meriteth, thereby moves another, either to reward him or puniſh him.</q> Now to walke in the light of this diſtinction, and not to pleaſe our ſelves by walking in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; though God be the prime, principall, and invincible cauſe of man's damnation in the kind of a cauſe efficient phyſicall (which ſhould not ſeeme ſtrange to an ordinary Chriſtian, who knowes full well that vengeance is God's peculiar worke, as <hi>the Iudge of all the world,</hi> and that he delights in the execution thereof) yet this hinders not but that <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Gen:</hi> 18. 25.</note> man may be the cauſe of his own damnation in the way of a meritorious cauſe, juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it. <hi>Omnis poena Deum habet Authorem, All puniſhment hath God for the Authour of it:</hi> This is a principle acknowledged both by the <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Vaſquez</hi> the Jeſuite; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is puniſhment inflicted on any by the hands of God, ſave on thoſe who formerly have deſerved it. Conſider we farther, as touching the ſeverall kinds of cauſes formerly mentioned; if the queſtion be which is the principall, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> anſwereth, that this is not confined to any one kind of them; ſomtimes the materiall cauſe, ſomtimes the formall cauſe, ſomtimes the efficient, ſomtimes the finall cauſe is the demonſtrative cauſe, the cauſe <hi>propter quam,</hi> the cauſe by vertue where of the effect hath its exiſtence; but this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and ſpeciall cauſe is deſcribed thus, It is that whereby ſatisfactory anſwer is made to the queſtion demanding why ſuch a thing is. Now in execution of puniſhment or condigne vengeance, this ſatisfactory anſwer is made by repreſenting the meritorious cauſe, never by repreſenting the efficient cauſe: as for example, if it be demanded why ſuch a malefactor is executed upon the gallowes; no ſober man will anſwer, becauſe the Sheriffe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded it to be ſo, or becauſe the Judge would have it ſo; but becauſe he robd upon the high way, or committed ſome criminall fact or other, which is capitall by the lawes of our land, and to be puniſhed with hanging upon the gallowes. In like ſort if que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion be made why devills or wicked men are damned, is it our doctrine to referre the cauſe hereof to the mere pleaſure of God? Doe not all confeſſe that God inflicts damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> merely for their ſinnes and tranſgreſſions wherein they have continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death without repentance? Yet we acknowledge that God could have taken them off from their ſinnes while they lived if he would, by giving them repentance, as he hath dealt with us, and that merely of his free grace. For we willingly confes that our ſinnes are our owne, but our faith is not, our repentance is not. When I ſay our <hi>owne,</hi> I meane in reſpect that they are of our ſelves; otherwiſe we acknowledge both faith and repentance to be our owne <hi>accipiendo,</hi> in aſmuch as we receive them; but they are God's gifts, and ſo they are his <hi>dando,</hi> in aſmuch as he gives them as <hi>Remigius</hi> ſpeaketh. Now what is become of this Authours pompous diſcourſe? Is it not the like the cracking of thornes in the fire, making a great noiſe; but the light of diſtinction, like fire, ſets an end unto it, and makes it appeare in its owne likeneſſe, and proves nothing but a ſquib. For albeit God in his decree makes the damnation of reprobates to be neceſſary and unavoidable; yet ſeeing he makes it not to fall on any but for their ſinnes, what colour of diſhonour unto God, in ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhall neceſſarily and unavoidably be damned for betraying the Sonne of God, and afterwards moſt deſperatly murthering himſelfe? If hereupon he could no more avoid his damnation, then <hi>Aſtionax</hi> could the breaking of his neck, when the Grecians tumbled him downe from the tower of Troy; will any man that is not bereaved of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe make ſtrange of this? It is true God did appoint both <hi>Iudas</hi> and all other wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſons, that never break off their ſinnes by repentance, unto deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of his own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary diſpoſition. For God workes all things according to the counſaile of his will, and if <note place="margin">

And laſtly we willingly confeſſe that the decree of God was antecedent to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Eph:</hi> 1. 4.</note> of men; for reprobation is as antient as election; and election was made before the foundation of the world, if we believe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> rather then any other, who either by

word or deed doth manifeſt himſelfe to be of a contrary opinion. Still damnation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by God only for ſinne, and in degree anſwerable unto their ſinnes; and only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their ſinnes as a meritorious cauſe thereof; though God makes uſe of it to his owne ends and the manifeſtation of his owne glory as <hi>Solomon</hi> profeſſeth namely, that <hi>God made all things for himſelfe, even the wicked againſt the day of evill.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul tells, that as the Lord ſuffereth with long patience the veſſells of wrath prepared to deſtruction that</hi>

                              <hi>Rom:</hi> 9. 18.</note> 9. 20. <hi>Shall the thing formed ſay to it that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> Though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he makes but one ſort of them after a new faſhion, leaving the other in the ſtate of naturall corruption wherein he findeth them: And likewiſe is compared by the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to a <hi>Potter, who out of the ſame lump makes one veſſell unto honour, and an other unto diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour.</hi> But to returne, I have, I truſt, ſufficiently ſhewed that in all this which he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, when things are rightly underſtood, and duely conſidered, ther's nothing found alien from the holy nature of God, no more then it is repugnant to his holy nature to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and execute vengeance, condigne vengeance, even the vengeance of damnation on men for their ſinnes; in ſuch ſort that it ſhall unavoidably overtake all thoſe that breake not off their ſinnes by repentance before their death. Nothing more agreeable to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor to the nature of God revealed unto us in holy Scripture then this, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently nothing more agreeable to Chriſtian reaſon. But as for naturall reaſon; God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid we ſhould make that the rule of our faith, as concerning the reſurrection of the dead and the powers of the world to come, the rewards of heaven, and the torments of hell, where the worme never dieth, and the fire never goeth out. And may it not ſeeme very ſtrange, that a Chriſtian and a Divine, and one magnified by the <hi>Arminian</hi> party for great abilities ſhould undertake to prove this doctrine to be contrary to Scripture, to the nature of God and to ſound reaſon.</p>
                        <p>Well let us proceed to obſerve how well he performes what he undertakes. And here he ſaith. 1. <hi>That the Scripture makes man the principall, nay the only cauſe (in oppoſition to God) of his owne ruine.</hi> We anſwer, the Scripture makes man the only cauſe of his owne ruine in the meritorious cauſe; <hi>thus man's deſtruction is of himſelfe;</hi> But this nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders God from being the cauſe why vengeance, deſtruction and damnation are executed upon man; for he is the God to whom vengeance belongeth, &amp; <hi>he delights</hi> as well <hi>in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judgment,</hi> as in <hi>ſhewing mercy.</hi> Indeed did we maintaine that God damnes the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate whether man or Angells of his mere pleaſure, this Argument of his were ſeaſonable. We know full well that God of his free grace ſhewes mercy; but judgment only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on provocation, and herein he proceeds ſlowly too; for he is <hi>ſlow to wrath,</hi> and eaſie to be intreated. Yet God's afflicting is not alwaies for ſinne; neither doth it alwaies proceed in the way of puniſhment: when we ſuffer for <hi>Chriſt</hi> we have cauſe to rejoyce that he counts us worthy to ſuffer for his name; neither were the afflictions of <hi>Iob</hi> brought upon him for his ſinnes, but for the tryall of his faith, and to make him an example of patience to all ſucceeding generations; and as for that of <hi>Ezech: I will not the death of the wicked;</hi> It

is the uſuall courſe of men of this Authours ſpirit thus to render the wordes, whereas our laſt Engliſh tranſlation renders them thus, <hi>I have noe pleaſure in the death of the wicked.</hi> Now as a man may will that wherein he takes noe pleaſure; as a ſick-man takes a bitter potion ſometimes for the recovery of his health; ſo God may will that wherein he takes noe delight. And whether it be meant of firſt or ſecond death it cannot be denied but God wills it; <hi>for he workes all things according to the councell of his owne will.</hi> Then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Eph:</hi> 1. 11.</note> if we conſider the infliction of death as an execution of judgment, God not only <hi>willeth</hi> this, but <hi>delights</hi> therein alſo, as it is expreſſed. That of <hi>Proſper</hi> is nothing to the <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ier.</hi> 9. 24.</note> preſent purpoſe, we treating here of the cauſe of damnation, not of ſinning; we ſay God is <hi>the God to whom vengeance belongeth,</hi> not to whom ſinne belongeth. Beſides ſinne, as ſinne, hath noe <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe at all, but <hi>defficient,</hi> as <hi>Auſtine</hi> hath delivered many hundered yeares agoe. It is true, it is in Gods power to preſerve any man from any ſinne; it is in his power to take any man off from any ſinfull courſe by repentance, if he will; but he is bound to none, <hi>he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth;</hi> and in all this he is not culpable.</p>
                        <p>In the next place he tels us; It is contrary to God's nature but what? To damne men for their ſinnes neverbroken offby repentance? for all our divines maintaine that God is Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of damnation to none but ſuch; and to ſuch God is not mercyfull nor gratious, nor ſuffers them any longer, nor ſhewes any goodneſſe towards them; while they lived he did; yea <hi>much long ſuffering and patience,</hi> inviting them thereby to repentance; yea and by his; word alſo inviting many; but after they dye in ſinne, therewithall an end is ſett to the diſpenſation of Gods gracious proceedings with them. Much leſſe doe we deny him to <hi>be good and mercifull and of great kindneſſe to all that call upon him.</hi> For Gods mercy doth not exerciſe it ſelfe by neceſſity of nature, but by freedome of will; yet <hi>he heareth the cry of Ravens and not a Sparrow falleth to the ground without the providence of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father, and the very Lyons roaring after thir prey, doe ſeeke their meat at the hands of God:</hi> Theſe mercyes are temporall; but as for ſpirituall mercyes, for the working and cheriſhing of Sanctification theſe are not extended unto all, but to ſome only, even <hi>to whom he will.</hi> And accordingly the elect of God are called <hi>veſſels of mercy.</hi> Yet to the <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom:</hi> 9. 18. <hi>Rom:</hi> 9. 23.</note> execution of damnation on any he proceeds not till after death, and ſtayes no longer; ſo ſlow to wrath he is towards the worſt, and no more ſlow to the beſt of them. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Micah, that taketh away iniquity?</hi> here this Authour out of wiſdome maketh a ſtoppe, leaving out that which followeth <hi>and paſſing by the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the remnant of his heretage:</hi> That reſtriction belike he did not ſo well brooke; but having leapt over that; he is content to take in that which followeth, <hi>he retaineth not his wrath for ever, becauſe mercy pleaſeth him:</hi> to witt, towards the remnant of his heritage, of his people. But I hope nought of this can hinder God from being the Authour of damnation to all that dye in ſinne without repentance without any prejudice to his holineſſe, though he retaineth wrath for ever againſt them.</p>
                        <p>We come to his <hi>reaſon</hi> which he calls <hi>ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> ſaying that <hi>it cannot but argue ſuch a decree of extreame cruelty.</hi> But what decree? of that wherby he hath decreed to damne all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſinne without repentance? For to none other hath God decreed da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation in the opinion of any of our divines. But that which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mends as <hi>ſound</hi> let us examine. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in reaſon think, ſayth he, <hi>that any man in the world can ſo far put off humanity and nature as to reſolve with himſelfe to marry &amp; beget Children, that after they are borne and have lived a while with him, he may hang them up by the tongues, teare their fleſh with ſcourges, pull it from their bones with burning pincers, or put them to any cruell tortures, that by thus torturing them, he may ſhew what his autority and power is over the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Much leſſe can we beleive that God ſhould ordaine infinite multitudes of his Children to everlaſting fire.</hi> Is it credible that this Authour himſelfe doth not believe that very doctrine which here he impugneth Doth he not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God hath <hi>ordained infinite multitudes</hi> of thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he calls <hi>Gods Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire?</hi> doth he not I ſay believe this as well as we? Doth he not believe that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever dyeth in ſinne without repentance ſhall be damned? doth he not believe that God of his mere pleaſure hath made ſuch a decree? It is increedible he ſhould not be of the ſame faith in this. Are not all Gods ordinances made of his mere pleaſure? could he not both ordaine and execute the annihilation of ſinners if it pleaſed him? and that either immediatly upon the committing of ſinne, or after ſome certaine yeares enduring the puniſhment of hell fire. And as for hell fire it ſelfe, could not he qualifie or increaſe the tormenting nature thereof as he ſhould thinke good? All this I nothing doubt but he believes, unleſſe with Origen and the Jewes, he be of opinion that the fire
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56120:177"/>
provided for the devill and his angells is not everlaſting: what madneſſe then, what phrenſy poſſeſſeth him ſo to diſpute againſt us, as to diſpute againſt himſefe? Vndoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly this Authour would have his Reader ſo propitious unto him, as to underſtand and interpret him beyond that which his owne words doe import; as namely thus, That God hath not only of his abſolute pleaſure made ſuch an ordinance, that all who dye in ſinne without repentance ſhall be damned; but rather thus; That God hath ordained that Infinite multitudes of his children ſhall be damned, not for their owne ſinnes, but only out of his abſolute pleaſure. For this is generally the unſhamefaſt carriage of men of this Authours ſpirit. Now what one divine of ours can he ſhew to have maintain'd this? Yet this is the imputation he chargeth upon us, that by our doctrine <hi>God reſolveth upon the deſtruction of many innocent ſoule, eternally in hell fire.</hi> Yet this is a very Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bologious expreſſion. For when were they innocent in his meaning? when they were damned? If this be in his meaning, can he name any divine of ours that affirmes this? Or doth he meane they were innocent when God entertaind this reſolution? And doth not he as well as we maintaine that there was a time, when Angels were innocent though afterwards they became devils; yet both then and from all eternity God had entertained ſuch a reſolution; For his decrees were everlaſting as we ſay; neither hath he hitherto manifeſted his opinion to the contrary; whether he maintaineth ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion ſecretly in his breſt, I know not; If he doth, and ſhames to declare it let him pull himſelfe by the noſe; in the paſſages he produceth out of <hi>Cicero</hi> concerning <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi> and out of <hi>Virus</hi> concerning ſuch like <hi>pag:</hi> 9. Yet we doe not ſay they were <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> when God made his decree of Reprobation. I ſhould ſhew my ſelfe an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> to ſay ſo, We ſay they were neither innocent nor nocent then, foraſmuch as till the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation no Creature had any beeing but God's decree of Election (and conſequently <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Eph:</hi> 1. 4,</note> of Reprobation alſo) had its beeing before the foundation of the world. 2 This manner of reaſoning which this Authour calleth <hi>ſound,</hi> I have found long a goe in <hi>Caſtalio,</hi> as ſuperficiary a Divine as ever put pen to paper.

Conſider is it decent to conforme the courſes of God with the courſes of men? May not we conſider in like manner againſt the Lord's foreknowledge, as well as againſt his decree, &amp; reaſon thus: what man of common humanity would reſolve with himſelfe to marry and beget children, did he foreſee their wicked courſes, and what will become of them for it, namely, to be condemned to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire with the Divell and his Angells? what ſhall we therefore conclude that God did not foreſee the wicked waies and ungodly courſes of all Reprobates, that they would continue in them and die in their ſinnes without all faith in Chriſt and true repentance
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56120:178"/>
towards God? And if he did foreſee what would be the ends of them in caſe he did cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them and bring them forth into the world, yet ſeeing he would nevertheleſſe create them and bring them forth into the world, one after another in their ſeverall times and ages, ſhall we brand the holy name of God, and reproach him for unnaturallneſſe, and barbarous crueltie? Rather I will ſay what meanes this Auhour ſo unconſcionably to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the ſtate of the queſtion, by mentioning only the ſhortneſſe of their life, and utterly concealing the wickedneſſe of their life, the only meritorious cauſe of their torments which they ſuffer, and accordingly to ſhape the ends intended by God, to be only the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of his power and Soveraingtie over them, without all mention of his juſtice; whereas we ſay that in the inflicting of damnation, the cheife glory which, God manifeſts is only the glory of his juſtice proceeding herein according to a law which himſelfe hath made (as moſt fit it is the Creatour ſhould give lawes to his creature) and the law is this, <hi>whoſoever believeth and repenteth ſhall be ſaved, whoſoever dyeth in ſinne without repentance ſhall be damned.</hi> Not one of our Divines (that I know) maintaines, that inflicting dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the Lord proceedes merely according to the good pleaſure of his will, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of faith and repentance, we willingly confeſſe the Lord proceedes merely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good pleaſure of his will; and it is expreſſe <hi>Pelagianiſme</hi> to affirme that <hi>grace is given according unto workes.</hi> And herein this Authour is very well content to walke in the darke and conceale his moſt corrupt opinion moſt oppoſite to the grace of God. But that damnation ſhould be inflicted without reſpect to ſinne as the meritorious cauſe thereof what one of our Divines can he produce that affirmeth? Yet thus he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to diſguiſe our opinion (when he findes the poverty of his ſtrength to wage faire warre) and ſo expoſe it to the hatred of me; as if God ordained to damne men not for their ſinnes, but of his owne mere pleaſure. Thus of old the enemies of the Goſpell dealt with Chriſtians: for firſt they would cloath them with beare skinnes, and then ſet doggs upon them. All that he hath to ſay to excuſe his ſhameleſſe crimination (though ſo much he doth not expreſſe here) is only this, that our Divines maintaine the decree of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to preceed the foreſight of ſinne. Yet this is untrue of the moſt part of them, who premit both the foreſight of ſinne originall before reprobation from grace, and of ſinne actuall before the decree of damnation; I willingly confeſſe for my part, that I concurre with neither; and if I ſhould, I ſhould withall make the decree of permitting of ſinne to preceed the decree of damnation, for which I ſee no reaſon; but yet I doe not make the decree of permitting ſinne to follow the decree of damnation. I hold theſe decrees to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimultaneous, thus, that God at once decrees both to create men, and ſuffer them all to fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> and to bring them forth in their ſeverall generations into the world, and to beſtowe the grace of faith and repentance upon the one, and ſo to ſave them, and to deny the ſame grace unto others, finally permitting them in their ſinfull courſes, and ſo to damne them for ſinne; and all to manifeſt the glory of his mercy to the one, and the glory of his juſtice on the other, yea and his ſoveraingty too, but wherein? not in rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the one with Salvation and inflicting damnation on the other; but only in giving grace to the one, and not to the other. And all the difference between our Divines is merely in <hi>apice Logico, a point of Logick</hi> To wit, as touching the right ordering of decrees, concerning ends, and meanes tending to the ends; all concurring in this, that, <hi>God hath mercy on whom he will,</hi> in beſtowing faith and repentance upon them, <hi>and whom he will he hardeneth,</hi> in denying the ſame graces unto others. Now when this Authour ſhall fairly prove that according to our opinion, <hi>God deſtroyeth the righteous with the wicked;</hi> then and not till then, ſhall he prove that our faith differeth from the faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi> What Divine of ours was ever knowne to affirme that God damneth any one that dyeth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? Yet it cannot be denied but that temporall judgments befall the righteous, as well as the wicked. When the Lord ſwept away 70 thouſand with a three dayes peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the land of Iſrael; was it not poſſible thinks this Authour, that any of God's deare children ſhould periſh by that peſtilence? To be caried away into captivity by an heatheniſh nation, I ſhould thinke is a greater calamity then to dye of the peſtilence; yet thoſe who were carried away into <hi>Babylon</hi> with King <hi>Iechoniah,</hi> the Lord repreſents by <note place="margin">

Were all damned will this Authour ſay, that periſhed in the flood?

In damning many Infant chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of heathen men dying in originall ſinne unremitted; as M. <hi>Maſon</hi> in his lectures at <hi>Magdalen</hi> Hall maintained, that, <hi>the puniſhment of originall ſinne unremitted was eternall damnation.</hi> And M. <hi>Hord</hi> confeſſeth as much in his preface, <hi>Sect:</hi> 4. 3. Yea and in making the Soule of Chriſt the holy Sonne of God an offering for the ſinnes of others. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider we his anſwer.</p>
                        <p>To appoint to hell, what is it but to appoint to the ſufferings of the torments of hell? Now doth any of our Divines maintaine that God appoints any man to the ſuffering of hell torments of his mere pleaſure, and not for ſinne? They doe not, and therefore this Authours diſcourſe depends upon a mere fiction deviſed in his own brain. 2. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction which here he makes is the diſtinction of <hi>Arminius,</hi> who maintained that God can doe that <hi>per potentiam, by power,</hi> which he cannot doe <hi>per juſtitiam, by juſtice,</hi> which I have diſproved at large in a peculiar digreſſion on this argument in my <hi>Vindiciae;</hi> and not one of my reaſons there brought doth this Authour once offer to anſwer.

He ſuppoſeth very judiciouſly to his own advantage, that there is a juſtice in God towards his creature ſecluding the ordinance of his will; whereas both <hi>Suarez</hi> and <hi>Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez</hi> oppoſite in other particulars concerning God's juſtice, doe yet agree in this, that there is no juſtice in God towards his creature, but upon ſuppoſition of his will and <note place="margin">

He may as well ſay that it is not compatible with the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God to puniſh (as it ſignifies to inflict paineon) him who is holy. For juſtice is as well oppoſite to the puniſhing of an Inocent, as to the puniſhing of him in ſuch a degree. And conſequently God cannot in juſtice put an holy man to death, much leſſe annihilate him; which if he ſaith, he ſhall contradict <hi>Arminius.</hi> 5. If it be not compatible with God's juſtice to inflict hell paines on any man, no fault of his preexiſting in the eternall mind, then either Chriſt ſuffered not the paines of hell, or was not without fault; or laſtly God was unjuſt in inflicting thoſe paines upon him. 6. In the laſt place obſerve, for all this he gives us nothing but his bare word. So that if we give him leave he is like enough to dictate unto us Articles of beleife at his pleaſure.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 By what right is <hi>vengeance</hi> due to the <hi>obſtinate</hi> and <hi>impenitent?</hi> Is it due by any other

right then by the ordinance of God? Cannot God pardon it if it pleaſe him, yea and cure it too? And if he be pleaſed to puniſh it, cannot he puniſh it as well by annihilation of the obſtinate (ſo to ſet an end unto his ſin as to himſelfe) as by condemnation of him? That of <hi>Auſtine</hi> is ſpoken in reference to God's law, whereby he hath ordained that without evill deſervings he ſhall not be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned (yet Chriſt ſuffered hell paines without any evill deſervings) In reſpect of the like law, he ſhall be unjuſt, if he he ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, who dye in faith and repentance, with everlaſting life.

                        <p n="2">2 How doth God communicate grace unto his creatures? is it not by neceſſity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or freedome of will? Philoſophers were wont to argue the eternity of the world by this, that <hi>Bonum eſt ſui communicativum, That which is good is apt to communicate it ſelfe, yea naturally and neceſſarily:</hi> And therefore God being <hi>optimus the beſt,</hi> as well as <hi>maximus the greateſt,</hi> was moſt communicative, and that naturally and neceſſarily. If the ſame be this Authours opinion, he is as <hi>Atheiſticall</hi> as they: But if by freedome of will he communicates his goodneſſe, then he communicates his goodneſſe, as when he will, ſo likewiſe how he will, and to whom he will. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expreſlely profeſſeth ſaying, <hi>God hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth,</hi> of ſuch places as theſe this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour <note place="margin">

For he hath not dealt ſo with any nation,</hi> as with them. 2. 'Tis untrue that God communicates unto his creatures that good which is in himſelfe: for the <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pſ:</hi> 73. 1</note> good which is in himſelfe is of a more tranſcendent nature, then to be communicable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to creatures; ſuch conceits are <hi>Manichaicall.</hi> God is eſſentally whatſoever he is: But the <note place="margin">

                        <p n="3">3. If Gods goodneſſe incline him to communicate goodneſſe unto the creature, as farre as he can without wronging juſtice, then it inclines him to communicate holineſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all to preſerve all from ſinne, to bring all to faith and to repentance, and ſo to ſave all.

                           <p>It is further objected, that we doe and may ſlaughter our beaſts for our dayly uſe, without any cruelty and iniquity, And therefore God may as well and much more appoynt as many of us as he pleaſeth to the torment of hell, for his glory, and yet be juſt and good to notwithſtanding. For there is a greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion between God and us, then there is between us and beaſts.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 For anſwering hereunto we are firſt to premiſe thus much, namely that our ſlaughtering of Beaſts <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> for our dayly uſe is by Gods ordinance, and appoyntment. We had not the authority of our ſelves, but God of his bounty towards us, gave it us, as we may ſee <hi>Gen:</hi> 9. 2, 3. Where we may obſerve, 1 That God delivereth up all creatures, Beaſts, Birds, and Fiſhes into the hands of men. 2 That the end why he doth ſo, is that they might be meat for men, and conſequently they might be ſlaine. Which being ſo, our ſlaughtering of Oxen, Sheep and other creatures for our dayly uſe is to be accounted Gods doing, rather then ours. And therefore the objection ſhould be made this. God may without any breach of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or juſtice appoint bruite creatures to be ſlaine for mans uſe, therefore he may ordaine men to be caſt into hell torments for his owne uſe, that is for the declaration of his ſoveraingty.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 This being premiſed I anſwer further that this compariſon holds not, For there is little <hi>proportion</hi> between the <hi>Objects</hi> compared, and leſſe between the <hi>acts.</hi>

Which ſheweth that he put a wide difference between the blood of men and beaſt.

But he cannot without both theſe antecedently decree to keepe him alive for ever in Hell, that he may there torment him without end, to ſhew his ſoveraingty. For this is to inflict an infinite evill upon a guiltleſſe creature, to whom he had given but a finite good: And ſo is the compariſon moſt unequall too, in the acts compared, and therefore proveth juſt nothing.</p>

                        <p>Belike as many as have not the word of God, to read this Authours acute obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of <hi>Gen:</hi> 9. 2. 3. (For he would not ſeeme to be any of the blunter ſort) doe <note place="margin">Repl.</note> ſin as often as they kill a chicke to feed upon, though beaſts of prey doe as much as this comes to, and more without all ſin. 2 Yet M <hi>Perkins</hi> thought it enough to take notice that commonly it is received as lawfull, without enquiring whence this authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty proceeds And noe Chriſtian doubts, but our very bodyes, and ſoules and all, we have from our maker. 3 Are all beaſts for meat? Or hath not man power to ſlaughter any but for meat? Where doth the Authour find this in <hi>Gen:</hi> May we not kill Lyons, Beares, wolves, unleſſe we eat them forthwith, or pouder them up, that by degrees we may make meat of them? ſo of ſnakes, and Adders and all the Serpents that <hi>Lybia</hi> brings forth? 4 I deny that our ſlaughtering of oxen is in this reſpect, or in any reſpect to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Gods doing rather then ours. For Gods appoyntment in this, is but of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a permiſſion, not of a command. We may live by fruits and hearbs and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malads and ſucketts, or butter, milke and cheeſe, if we think good. Were it a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, yet would it not follow that it is Gods worke rather then ours. For he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands good workes and forbids evill workes. Now will this Author herehence conclude, that our good workes are rather Gods workes then ours. I trow he will not 5 Therefore wee keepe to our owne argument, and not regard his infatuation of it, and we were in a pretty caſe, if we ſhould ſuffer our adverſaries to ſhape our Arguments If they once have the grinding of our Tooles, no marvaile if they ſoone grind out all the edge of them. We ſay
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56120:180"/>
it is lawfull for man to doe all this that is ſpoken of, upon our fellow creatures, and ſhall not God have as much power over us? Doth not the Apoſtle himſelfe diſpute after this manner, and make the power which God hath over us, equall to the power which the Potter hath over the worke of his own hands and over the clay alſo. <hi>Shall the thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſay to it that formed it why haſt thou made me thus? hath not the Potter power over the clay of the ſame lump to make one veſſell unto honour and another unto diſhonour?</hi> We cannot take life from a creature without pain, deadly pain: if we have lawfull power to inflict pain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another creature, hath not God greater power to inflict pain, yea the greateſt pain upon us, and that without all reſpect to ſinne? And that this God can doe as Lord of life and death, both <hi>Vaſquez</hi> the Jeſuite acknowledgeth, and <hi>Medina</hi> pronounceth <hi>ex concordi Theologorum ſententiâ, by the unanimous conſent of all Divines,</hi> as elſewhere I have ſhewed and proved by variety of demonſtration; like as <hi>Raynaudus</hi> confirmes it by the concurrant teſtimony of the Antients in the places formerly mentioned. 2. In the next place he comes to his anſwer, and ſaith that the compariſon holdes not. And I commend this Authours wiſdome in troubling himſelfe with no more objections, then he thought himſelfe able to Maſter. For who would not keep his ſhinns whole the beſt he can? But I wounder he comes off no better, even then, when he makes choice of ſuch adverſaries, as he thinks he can well grapple with.</p>
                        <p>1. Little proportion will ſerve turne; it is enough for us that they are all God's creatures; and ſurely there is leſſe proportion between the Creatour and the creature, then between one creature and another. Yet ſure I am, every creature that hath life is more noble then a creature without life, ſuch as a Potters veſſell is; yet look what power the Potter hath over his veſſell; the Apoſtle tells us that God hath the ſame power over his creature man. Secondly, the Authour was ſenſible of the weaknes of this bowſtring, and ſeeing it would <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom:</hi> 9. 21.</note> not hold, therefore he relyes upon another, and thats his owne deforming and disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our argument, drawing it from the compariſon of man's power over his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with God's power over us; to conclude therehence that God the Creatour hath as great power over his creature; as man by God's graunt hath power over his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. From this due courſe of compariſon which we propoſe, this Authour drawes us to a wild compariſon of the power of God over beaſts, with the power of God over man; which is not ours, but an immodeſt and unſhamefaſt fiction of this Authour; and that grounded upon immodeſt foundations as before hath been ſhewed. Thirdly, yet why not ſo great a difference between God and man, as between God and beaſts? Is not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance infinite? Is it poſſible to be leſſe, ſeeing man is but finite, and God infiinte? For ſtill the perfection of man is but in the way of perfection create. But God's perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is of a tranſcendant nature it being uncreat: which when School-men have conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they have affirmed that the perfection of creatures is to be meaſured not by approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to God who is, <hi>ens primum, the firſt being,</hi> but by their remotion rather <hi>à non eſſe, from not being;</hi> As I remember to have read long agoe in <hi>Paulus Venetus,</hi> and which then ſeemed to me moſt congruous, nither to this day doe I ſee any juſt cauſe to oppoſe it. 2. I come to the ſecond anſwer; And here I find this diſcourſe to breath the ſpirit of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi> as truly as if it were ſpit out of his own mouth. Now <hi>Arminius</hi> on this point I have anſwered at larg, as this Authour well knowes: he is content to paſſe that by, and keep himſelfe ſtill like a Sow in beanes, without raiſing any noiſe of ſolving ought hath been <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Exam: prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt. Perkin: p.</hi> 41.</note> delivered in proofe hereof. But though he lets paſſe that wich I have delivered without anſwer, renewing only <hi>Arminius</hi> his objection; yet I will not let this his anſwer to his own objection paſſe without a reply.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Therefore whereas he ſaith there <hi>is no proportion between killing and eternall tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> Imarke his cunning carriage, he doth not ſay there <hi>is no proportion between killing and tormenting</hi> wich are two acts; and acts are ſomewhat capable of proportion. And ſurely if he had, killing would appeare to be the worſt of the two; ſince to kill is to torment and ſomewhat more, even to deſtroy the being of a man. Therefore the compariſon which he ſhapes is between killing and eternall tormenting; that is not between two acts, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to from the compariſon, but between one act, and the eternall duration of an other act, which is the quantity thereof in reference to time, ſuch is this Authours jugling. Yet notwithſtanding the diſproportion of theſe things, hence it followes not, that <hi>killing</hi> is the more deſirable of the two; conſidering that many apain there is which man would be content to endure, rather then to looſe his life? So farre is it from being worſe, and that beyond all proportion. <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſomewhere profeſſing of infants pain in hell, that is <hi>poena mitiſſima, the mildeſt pain,</hi> &amp; ſuch as they had rather endure then to have no being at all.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56120:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>
2. But take it for an intollerable tormenting; if there be no proportion between killing and eternall tormenting; whereas there is ſome proportion between man and beaſt, then it were reaſonable for any man to deſire to be turned into a beaſt rather then to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally tormented: now let every reaſonable creature conſider, the ſobriety of ſuch a choice. 3. If only the eternity of it makes killing to be preferred before tormenting, then it is not to be denyed, but tormenting a creature in hell fire a thouſand or ten thouſand yeares may be performed by God upon an innocent man, only eternall torment cannot. Yea and ſo ten thouſand to an hundred thouſand yeares, and ſo forwards untill it comes to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, which indeed can never be; it being a thing utterly impoſſible to attaine from a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning unto eternity by degrees. A finite added to a finite being never able to make it infinite. And therefore to maintain a thing infinite in quantitie, <hi>Ariſtole</hi> hath taught us that it is to maintain a multitude of infinites (and indeed an infinite of infinites.) For if the parts be but finite, it is impoſſible that the whole conſiſting of finite parts can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite. 4. Though man cannot without barbarous cruelty torment his beaſt, and prolong the life of it; Yet I hope this Authour will not deny this to be in the power of God, and that for the leaſt ſinne committed by man. And this was it that I propoſed in my anſwer to M. <hi>Hord,</hi> to ſhew the power of God in ſuch a kind, wherein it were abominable crueltie in man to exerciſe his power: like as the barbarous cruelty of <hi>Tiberius</hi> is ſet forth by them that write the hiſtory of his life. And the truth is, it is a very difficult point to reſolve how it can ſtand with juſtice divine thus to deale with a creature, though a ſinner. Yet I know many courſes are taken to ſolve this difficultie, and the beſt that I have met with is this in my judgment; That a man dying in ſinne, his ſinne continueth eternall (never broke off by repentance) as well as the pain, yet this upon examination is found to have its flawes, and will not ſatisfie. So that the beſt and finall reſolution is to have recourſe to God's abſolute power, as a Creatour over his creatures. And that abſolute power will make it good even over an innocent creature as over a creature nocent. And it were very ſtrange to affirme that God hath not as much power over us as we have over our beaſts, namely to put them to pain, to doe us ſervice. Now if it be lawfull to inflict but one degree of pain upon an innocent creature, what reaſon can be given why he cannot inflict two degrees, and if ſo why not three, and ſo aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the higheſt degree? Then as touching the duration of it, if he can inflict ſuch a pain for an houre, he may as well for two houres; and for a whole day: And if for a day he may as well for two daies, yea for a week<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 for a week he may as well for a moneth, and if for a moneth, he may as well for two or three; if for three, as well for ſix; and if for ſix, as well for twelve; and if for a yeare, as well for two; and as well for foure, and ſo <hi>in infinitum;</hi> from tenns to hundreds, and from hundreds to thouſands For no reaſon can poſſibly make evidence where we ought to make a ſtand; in ſuch ſort as that an afliction in ſuch a degree is lawfull, and immediatly after increaſing becomes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. 2. Yet conſider we ſpeak not now of decreeing, but of executing (whereas the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection proceeded concerning God's decreeing) Now between the decree and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſinne may intercede by God's permiſſion, and that neceſſarily thereupon as <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth. But now to the point whereon we are in preſent, we ſuppoſe the perſon to be moſt holy, even as holy as the Sonne of God; on whom notwithſtanding were inflicted, as all confeſſe, either hell paines, or that which was equivalent to hell paines. 3. Yet this evill thus inflicted will never come to be infinite, ſtill it continueth fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, though <hi>in infinitum;</hi> it being utterly impoſſible by addition to make that which is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite become infinite. 4. But were it infinite, yet this Authours caution would help us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Authour himſelfe. For the good which God hath given ſuch a creature, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo infinite, to wit his being. How much more if God preſerve that creature from ſinne, which by <hi>Arminius</hi> his cofeſſion, makes a man more miſerable, then hell paines it ſelfe. Laſtly that there is ſuch an abſolute power in God <hi>Raynaudus</hi> juſtifies both out of the twelvth of wiſdoome. <hi>Cum ſis juſtus, juſte omnia diſponis.

                        <p>I am glad to ſee my name ſo often remembred by this Authour in his margent; for a long time I deſired to know his way by certaine evidence; for I would not ſuffer my ſelfe <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> to be carried away with rumours; and withall I found ſome contradiction in the relations I received from different perſons, but at length I was ſo happy as to ſee it under his own hand, and there to obſerve not his judgment only, but the ſtrength of his affections alſo. Now let the Reader obſerve the cunning carriage of this Authour, and how farre off it is from all ingenuitie. For what I diſcourſe, being drawne thereunto by <hi>Arminius</hi> his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, that this Authour obtrudes upon me, as if the defence of the cauſe I tooke in hand had drawn me thereunto, notwithſtanding that I have profeſſed the contrary. For thus I write <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 1. <hi>De electione Sect:</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 127. <hi>In the canvaſing of this ſection Arminius runs out at large, ſaving that moſt of theſe things which here he heapes up are aliena,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pertinent to the preſent purpoſe; as pertaining rather to the <hi>decree of reprobation, then to the decree of election.</hi> And a little after I write thus; <hi>Hence it is that Arminius expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiates and transfers his diſputation from the point of election, to the point of Reprobation too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably: Yet wiſely affecting the incolumity of his wavering cauſe. By that right</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which God hath over his creature, he cannot ordaine any man to the ſuffering of pain without the foreſight of ſinnne. To wit that his cauſe might ſtand upright, and that this examiner might omit nothing that tends to the making of his opinion plauſible with his propitious reader, it was needfull that he ſhould make uſe of ſome ſuch tranſition, though never ſo unreaſonable but ſeeing ſuch are the wiles and artifices of our Adverſaries to confound all Scholaſticall method, it ſhall not be unſeaſonable for me to weigh what he delivers as briefly as I can.</hi> Therefore after I had refuſed <hi>Arminius</hi> on that point, where he denyes, that God can doe that injuſtice, which he can doe by power; after this manner I enter upon a new digreſſion concerning this point. <hi>Hitherto have I followed Arminius in his extravagants. For M. Perkins hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo farre; as to affirme that God hath power to afflict an innocent creature, neither hath his Adverſaries objected any ſuch thing unto him, as juſtly inferred from ought delivered by him.</hi> So that all ſuch have well hardened their foreheads, who faigne that our opinion cannot well ſubſiſt without the help of ſo horrid and ſo harſh an aſſertion, to wit, <hi>That it is better to be miſerable, then not to be at all.</hi> It is true, ſome may conceive that though this were a truth, it were to be ſuppreſſed, rather then affirmed by reaſon of the harſhneſſe of it. Let every one conſider aright that I undertake the defence of M. <hi>Perkins,</hi> and it is he that hath uttered this harſh aſſertion, (namely, <hi>That God can inflict hell paines without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny demerit in the creature)</hi> out of <hi>Cameracenſis:</hi> And it ſtood me upon to defend M. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> ſo farre as I had reaſon for it. Now finding the maine argument whereby <hi>Arminius</hi> maintaines the contrary (to that other, yet more harſh propoſition) to be moſt unſound; and even this aſſertion which ſounds moſt harſh in the eares of many, not only to be maintained by <hi>Auſtine</hi> himſelfe and and divres Schoole-Divines, but anſwered by many arguments, the ſolution whereof was never expedited by any; have I deſerved ſo ſharply to be cenſured for repreſenting all this in the way of juſtifying M. <hi>Perkins,</hi> whoſe defence I undertook againſt <hi>Arminius?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. My words are theſe tranſlated, <hi>God can annihilate the holieſt creature, which Arminius confeſſeth, how much more is it in his power to afflict an innocent creature, and that for ever, conſidering that not only according to Schoole-divines, but alſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Auſtine, yea according to the truth it ſelfe, it is more to be deſired to have being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

                           <hi>any pain, then to have no being at all.</hi> And afterwards I propoſe not one argument of mine own for the juſtifying of this, but only repreſent the diſcourſe of <hi>Auſtine</hi> hereupon, as it is analized by <hi>Durandus</hi> that Schoole Divine. Now why are not the School-men cenſured, <hi>as men ſpeaking unreaſonably and againſt common ſenſe?</hi> Nay why is not <hi>Auſtine</hi> cenſured as one <hi>that had rather ſpeak unreaſonably and againſt common ſenſe; then lay downe the concluſion which he hath once undertaken to maintain,</hi> as well as my ſelfe? Yea and much more conſidering that the diſcourſe proving this, is Saint <hi>Auſtin's;</hi> and had I not added on the by theſe four words <hi>etiam ſecundum ipſam veritatem,</hi> there had been no place at all for any cenſure to be paſt upon me. If a man finding himſelfe convicted by <hi>Auſtin's</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſhall confeſſe that what he writes is true, is it equity to cenſure him as one who had rather ſpeak unreaſonably and againſt common ſenſe, then lay down the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which formerly he hath undertaken to maintain. When in the mean time no cenſure is at all paſſed upon <hi>Auſtine,</hi> who alone is the player of the game, he that ſtands by profeſſing only in his judgment, he playes his game well.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If <hi>Auſtine</hi> hath ſpoken unreaſonably and againſt common ſenſe, how comes it to paſſe that this cenſurer hath not taken the paines to repreſent unto the world the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſſe of his argument? This authour ſpends his mouth frankly in cenſuring, but takes no paines to free his Reader from errour, by ſolving arguments produced by <hi>Auſtin</hi> for the proofe of that wich this Authour conceives to be an errour.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Nay he doth not ſo much as anſwer that one argument, which here is propoſed by me. An argument which the Scoole-men uſe as ſufficiently convincing the truth, as <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus</hi> and <hi>Ricardus.</hi> Yet conſidering the unreaſonable condition of ſuch adverſaries, who take no courſe to convince or confute their oppoſites, but imperiouſly to cry them down; I have taken the paines to call to an account both <hi>Auſtin's</hi> arguments and others propoſed by Schoole-Divines, and to deviſe with my ſelfe what anſwer might be made unto them, ſo to performe that for my adverſaries, which they ſhew no hart to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme for themſelves, and I was borne in hand that ſuch a digreſſion of mine ſhould be extant long ere this.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Yet by the way I wonder not a little that one thing is pretermitted. For if I miſtake not, this very Authour is the man that heretofore hath been very full mouthed in cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, not ſo much the doctrine it ſelfe, as a certain anſwer I made to an argument brought out of Scripture againſt it; namely from thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>It had been better for that man if he had never been born.</hi> My anſwer was, that it was ſpoken according to the judgment of man, though indeed erroneous; and that after this manner phraſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies of Scripture doe proceed I there ſhewed. Now this Authour hereupon ſpared not to profeſſe, that if this were true he would turne Atheiſt. I wiſht that Friend of mine to whom he ſpake this, to perſwade him the next time he met with him, to enquire and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well, whether <hi>Maldonat</hi> the Jeſuite doth not imbrace the ſame interpretation. And indeed if ſuch <hi>proteſtations</hi> would carry it, this Authour would prove a very potent and formidable adverſary, I have ſeen the like under his own hand, namely this, <hi>As Plutarch ſaid of the old heathens who ſacrificed men that they might pacifie their gods: that it had been better with Diagoras to ſay, There is no god, then to think that God is ſuch a one that delights in the blood of men:</hi> And hereupon he adds this Proteſtation, <hi>I proteſt unto you I think it leſs diſhonourable to the bleſſed Trinity, to ſay with the Atheiſt, there is no god, then to feigne ſuch a God, as the decree of Reprobation maintained by the Contraremonſtrants maketh him to be.</hi> This man I find is reſorted unto and conſulted with by the <hi>Arminians,</hi> as if his judgment were an oracle; and I willingly confeſſe he deſerves to be in ſome great place unto them: and no place in my judgmentmore fit then to be unto the, <hi>à proteſtationibus.</hi> Yet I doe not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe but leave it to their diſcretion to prefer him as they think good: but how comes it to paſſe, that here he is ſilent in reviving the reproaches he caſt upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my anſwer to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture before mentioned? Is it becauſe <hi>Maldonat</hi> the Jeſuite hath been ſince found by him to embrace the ſame interpretation? And he is loath to fall ſo foule in cenſuring ſuch as he is? Yet here he falls foul on me for profeſſing my approbation, not of Schoole-men but of <hi>Auſtin's</hi> diſcourſe. This makes me call to mind what was delivered of him ſometimes by a London Miniſter; as that he ſhould perſwade a young Divine to ſtudy <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> as alſo what cenſures others have paſſed upon ſome writings of his. And it hath been my hap to ſee under his own hand ſuch a counſaile as this give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a friend of his. <hi>Theſe things have I repreſented unto you the rather, becauſe I would give you occaſion to learne that in your younger dayes, which I have learned by late and long experience in my ſelfe, and that in theſe two things.

I found that I did miſtake their meaning, and that an itching deſire to find an advantage, made me to take ſhadowes for ſubſtance. And the like miſtake in my ſelfe I obſerved, when I read the fathers, or the Scriptures, ready to interpret every thing either in favour of mine own cauſe, or in prejudice of the adverſaries:</hi> And concludes ſententiouſly thus; <hi>Nimirum ita eſt ingenium noſtrum, facile credimus, quae nimium volumus.</hi> If ſuch be the genius of this Authour, though he thinks not good to ſpare me for <hi>Auſtin's</hi> ſake, yet methinks he ſhould ſpare me for <hi>Richardus</hi> ſake, or at the leaſt for <hi>Maldonat's</hi> ſake.

                           <q>To the firſt part of this reply, namely, that it is more deſirable to be in hell, then to be nothing. I oppoſe  three things. 1. The ſpeech of our Saviour concerning <hi>Judas: Woe be to that man by whom the Sonne of man is betraied, it had been good for that man if he had never been born</hi> Two things eſpecially are ſet forth in theſe words of our Saviour. Firſt the miſery of <hi>Judas</hi> the betraier of the Lord. <hi>Woe be &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, the greatnes of his miſery, <hi>It had been good &amp;c.</hi> It is as much as if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Judas</hi> the traitour ſhall be damned, and therefore ſo woefull will his condition be, that it had been good and happy for him, if he had never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a being: good in earneſt, as the Interpreters doe generally expound it, not in the opinion and eſteem of weak minded, faint-hearted-men only as ſome few underſtand it. For firſt let it be granted that Scripture ſpeaketh of things ſometimes according to men's opinions, yet without reaſon to faſten ſuch an expoſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> upon any Scripture, is to doe, as dunces doe in the Schooles, who being not able to anſwer a place in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are charged, ſhift it off, and ſay, <hi>(loquitur ex aliorum ſententiâ, he ſpeaks according to the opinion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.)</hi> 2. This ſcripture cannot in reaſon be thus expounded. Firſt becauſe it is an argument and ground by which Chriſt declareth the truth and greatneſſe of the miſery of <hi>Judas, Woe to the man &amp;c</hi> And why woe? Becauſe it had been good &amp;c. But it were no argument to ſhew his woefull eſtate by, to ſay that it had been good for him, that he had never been born in the opinion of men, who miſtake the caſe but not in truth. 2. becauſe this expoſition would teach and encourage men to be <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Epicures.</hi> In the ſecond of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> we read how voluptuous men doe ſtirre up one another to enjoy the good things, that are preſent, to fill them ſelves with wine and ointments, to leave ſome token of their jollity in every place and to practiſe all manner of wickedneſſe. And what is their motive? a falſe perſwaſion that their ſoules ſhall dye with their bodies; and that they ſhould have noe being after death. If this conceit would fleſh them thus in their opinions and voluptuous courſes, how freely and eagerly (may we thinke) would they purſue their carnall and ſinfull delights, if they could be but once perſwaded, that, after all their pleaſure they ſhould be in better caſe then if they had noe being? Secondly, I oppoſe common conſent. Where ſhall wee pick out a man, but will ſay (if he ſpeak from his heart) that he were better to vaniſh into a thouſand nothings, then to be <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Aug. Epiſt. ad Bon.</hi> 160.</note> caſt into hell. What is the reaſon why men are ſo afraid of hell, when they are touched to the quick with the conſcience of their ungodly lives, and the expectation of eternall vengeance, that with <hi>Job</hi> they curſe their birth day, and wiſh an hundred times over that they had never been, or might ceaſe to be, that ſo they might not come into the place of torments, but becauſe they judge a being there to be incomparably worſe, then no being any where? And why are men who are ſenſible of hell fire ſo ſtrongly curbed in the feare of feeling it, even from darling and beloved ſinnes, but becauſe they apprehend it to be the moſt terrible of terribles? Feare of being annihilated can never doe that, which the feare of hell doth.</q>

                        <p>M. <hi>Maſon</hi> went great bellied with theſe choiſe conceits, and therefore he will bring <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> them in though it be by the cares, in ſpite of his own friends: like as <hi>Arminius</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, to vent a certaine argument of his, which yet had a very unhappy iſſue to the betraying of the Authours nakedneſſe moſt ſhamefully; and his argument was this, <hi>To be happy is better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſimply to be; therefore to be miſerable, is worſe then ſimply not to be;</hi> now the conſequence is moſt inconſequent. For therefore to be happy is better then ſimply to be; becauſe, <hi>to be happy,</hi> includes being, &amp; addes hapines thereunto. And one good added to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother good muſt needs make the whole compound better. In like manner, <hi>If to be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> doth include the evill of not being and adde another evill thereunto, the whole compound muſt needs be worſe. But to the contrary it is apparent, that, <hi>to be miſerable</hi> doth not include the evill of not being, but the good of being rather; and conſequently there is no juſt proportion between miſery and happineſſe, And therefore though to be happy is better then ſimply to be (as including being, and ſome good thing more) yet thence it followes not, that to be miſerable, is worſe then not to be; for as much as, <hi>To</hi>
                           <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56120:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <hi>be miſerable,</hi> doth not include the evill of <hi>not being</hi> and adde ſome evill more to it. Now the firſt that affirmed this harſh poſition, namely, that <hi>to be miſerable is not worſe then not to be at all,</hi> was <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and he not only affirmes it, but diſputes it, and proves it by vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of arguments, not one whereof is anſwered by this Authour or by any friend that I know. And from <hi>Auſtin</hi> the School-men have taken it, and added this one argument to confirme it over and above thoſe of <hi>Auſtine's, To turne a man into nothing is to deſtroy a man's univerſall being; but to inflict torment upon him doth deſtroy only particular being,</hi> to wit, his being in eaſe and pleaſure. Now to have a man's particular being deſtroyed is not ſo bad, as to have a man's univerſall being deſtroyed. Now I come to conſider how this Authour carrieth himſelfe in overthrowing his own fiction. For albeit the poſition im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned by bim, be no fiction (for it was the opinion of <hi>Auſtin</hi> and of divers School-men) yet the bringing it in here, as if it were an anſwer made by us to any of our Adverſaries objections (as this Authour doth) as if we ſtood in need o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> any ſuch aide is a mere ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And firſt he ſtates it at pleaſure to ſerve his own turne, <hi>of being in hell to be more deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> whereas the Authour whom he oppoſeth delivers it of, <hi>eſſe mi erum to be miſerable</hi> and miſery is as well in reſpect of ſinne, as in reſpect of bodily torment Nay it is confeſſed by <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe, <hi>That the miſery of ſinne is greater, then the miſery of torment.</hi> So, that if it be uncouth to ſay, that to be under the torment of hell is better then not to be at all; it ought to ſeem more uncouth to ſay, that it is better for a man to be guilty of ſin, then to have no being at all. Now I doe not find that this Authour in all his Mountebank-like amplifications, did take this into conſideration. Againe when it is ſaid. <hi>That to be miſerable is better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to be,</hi> this is to be underſtood aright, not as if <hi>miſery</hi> it ſelfe were deſirable, but <hi>being</hi> only, though with the adjunct of miſery thus, <hi>to have</hi> a being though in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is more deſirable, then to have no being at all And ſo if it beapplyed to the miſery of <hi>torment,</hi> and that in hell, it ought to be taken thus, To have a being though in hell is more deſirable then to have no being at all. And it is apparent, that <hi>in not being at all,</hi> there is nothing at all deſirable, but in being; though under the greateſt pain there is ſomething deſirable, to wit, being. Now I conſider his reaſons.</p>
                        <p>He objecteth the ſaying of our Saviour to <hi>Iudas. Woe be to that man by whom the ſonne of man is betrayed, it had been good for that man if he had never been born:</hi> and indeed <hi>the betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sonne of God his Lord and maſter,</hi> was a moſt facinorous act, eſpecially being committed by the way of a kiſſe, &amp; with ſweet words ſaying <hi>Hayle Maſter.</hi> And School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe diſtinguiſh between, <hi>the miſery of ſinne, and the miſery of pain,</hi> in ſuch ſort that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they deny the latter to be worſe then <hi>not</hi> being, yet they doe not reaſon ſo of the former. But becauſe <hi>Iudas</hi> was not ſo ſenſible of the miſerable condition of the one, as of the other; therefore our Saviour ſets forth the woefull condition of that ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he, and generally all are moſt ſenſible. Whence we may well argue, that our Saviour ſpeakes in conformly to man's ſenſe and judgment, and it was not long ere the terrours of a guilty conſcience took hold of him, and he went forth and hang'd himſelfe. Yet our Saviour ſaith not, <hi>It had been good for Iudas if he had never received any being,</hi> but only this, <hi>If he had never been borne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> now being is not received in a man's birth but in the conception rather.

Not one that I know putteth any ſuch difference of men under the torments of hell. Like as the Prophet ſpeakes of the ſtouteſt, as well as the weakeſt, Can thy heart endure, or thine hands be ſtrong in the day that I have to deale with thee, or the Lord rather by <note place="margin">

                        <p n="1">1. But if I am glad to ſee the iſſue whereto he drives his diſcourſe. For he grants that the ſcripture ſpeakes ſometimes according to men's opinions: but without reaſon to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten ſuch an expreſſion upon any Scripture, is to doe as Dunſes doe &amp;c. he gives no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; I will ſupply the want thereof, and that out of one of thoſe dunſes a follower of <hi>Iohn</hi> Duns an eminet ſchool-man, from whoſe name ſchool-men are called dunſes, whom this Authour was woont to magnifie; <hi>Lychetus</hi> a <hi>Minorite</hi> is the man, who is the firſt that I have found hitherto maintaining that God's purpoſe of election of any particular man may ceaſe; and the purpoſe of reprobating the ſame may come in the place thereof. So the purpoſe of reprobating <hi>Iudas</hi> may come in the place thereof, and that without all change in God. This is a doctrine that now a dayes growes in requeſt <hi>Penotus</hi> hath taken it up without betraying from whom he had it: And <hi>Franciſcus à ſanctâ Clarâ</hi> after him, and ſome of our <hi>Arminians</hi> I find inamoured with it. Now this <hi>Lychetus,</hi> when he is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the doctrine of <hi>Scotus</hi> as directly oppoſite hereunto, his anſwer is in part that he ſpeakes according to the opinion of others. Now I deſire not upon better termes to contend with M. <hi>Maſon.</hi> For <hi>Auſtine</hi> hath given many reaſons to prove that ſimply and abſolutely not to be, is not a thing deſirable, above being, though joyned with never ſo great miſery of pain. And the School-men acknowledge that <hi>Auſtine</hi> herein delivers his judgment, and withall they concurre with him as <hi>Scot, Biel, Durandus, Maldonat.</hi> And it is evident that to be turned into nothing, is an univerſall deſtruction of being; ſo is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of puniſhment, as both <hi>Durandus</hi> and <hi>Maldonat</hi> argue the caſe. And ſaying that not to have any being at all is better for <hi>Iudas</hi> then to be in torment, here is ſomething affirmed of a ſubject that makes him of a better condition then otherwiſe, which hath no place, but upon ſuppoſition of a ſubjects exiſtence, &amp; that in diſtinction from an attribute affirmed of him, which conſtitutes him in a condition of betternes, now that that which is nothing, by reaſon of being nothing, ſhould be better the ſomething, is one of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt expreſſions, I think that hath been heard of ſince the world began; And therewithall creatures began to have a being. Againe conſider, take <hi>Gabriel</hi> the <hi>Arch-Angell</hi> moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a creature, and let every ſober man judge, whether it were better for him not to be, then being holy as he is to be tormented in hell fire. I ſhould think that albeit God ſhould torment me with hell fiire yet if he ſhould preſerve my ſoule from ſinne &amp; in the love of him out of the ſenſe of his love towards me, I ſhould have infinitly more cauſe to rejoyce then to complain, how weak ſoever I am at this preſent. Thirdly, if it be better and more deſirable to have no being at all, then to be in hell fire; then this is to be uderſtood of hell fire, either without limitation of time only: or with limitation. If only it hold in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of everlaſtingneſſe, then it followes it is better to be in hell fire, provided a man ſhall not everlaſtingly continue there, then to have no being at all, though it be for a thouſand yeares, not only twiſe told; but a thouſand times over and over, and that multiplied Cubically, and yet no end of multiplication of the time of tormenting. If it be better to have no being at all then to ſuffer hell torments ſo long, then it is better to have no being at all, then to ſuffer hell torments halfe ſo long: For no reaſon can be given to the contrary; In a word it will follow, that it were better to have no being, then to ſuffer hell torments one houre, or halfe an howre, or a quarter, or a minute, or halfe a minute. For no reaſon can define the bounds within which it will be better to ſuffer the paines of hell fire, then to be turned into nothing, and beyond which it will be worſe. But M. <hi>Maſon</hi> ſaith ſecondly. This Scripture cannot in reaſon be thus expounded: And
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56120:183"/>
he gives his reaſon for it: Becauſe it is an argument and ground by which Chriſt decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the greatneſſe or truth of the miſery of <hi>Iudas:</hi> and I pray let every ſober man judge, whether this be not a ſufficient amplification of that miſery, that they ſhall wiſh they had never been, or that they might be turned into nothing, rather then ſuffer ſuch tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. How many preferre death before this worlds miſery, and ſo goe on to deſtroy themſelves; will it therefore follow that death indeed, though it ſhould be an utter aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, is not ſo bad as to ſuffer the miſeries of this world. The miſtake of a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned perſon wiſhing not to be, conſiſts not in conceiving his torments to be unſufferable with any content or patience, but in conceiving that by not being, he ſhould have eaſe, which is a moſt abſurd conceit, ariſing merely from diſtraction of mind throug extremity of anguiſh. So that all things rightly conſidered, here is no encouragement for men to become <hi>Atheiſts &amp; Epicures,</hi> unleſſe this be an encouragement thereunto, that their pain ſhall be ſo extreme and unſufferable, as to make them deſire, and utter they know not what, ſuch diſtraction of mind and and perturbation of judgment ſhall ſurprize them. A falſe perſwaſion that mens ſoules ſhall die with their bodies, and that they ſhall have no being after death, urgeth every man indifferently to take his delights and pleaſures while he may; whether this delight and pleaſure be taken in courſes vicious, or in courſes ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, becauſe death ſets an end, as to them; ſo to their pleaſures and delights. But if their greateſt happineſſe, or miſery doth begin in joy, or ſorrow after death; and this is well known unto them: ſober reaſon doth ſuggeſt unto them to provide for the obtaining of that happineſſe, and declining that unhappineſſe, above all other, according to that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies reſolution in <hi>Sophocles,</hi> and that upon this ground <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>there I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ever.</hi> But when he ſaith the wicked will the more eagerly purſue their carnall and ſinfull delights, becauſe after all their pleaſures they ſhall be in a better caſe, then if they had no being. I long to have the judgment of any lewd perſon throughout the world concerning this; as namely whether he takes any comfort or encouragement to ſinfull courſes from this; that albeit he ſhall be caſt with the devill and his Angells into hell fire that never goeth out. Yet this condition is a better condition, then not to have any being at all; whereas this better condition conſiſts only in this, that being is better then not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; not in this, that he hath any eaſe, or is leſſe obnoxious to torment and ſorrow, which ſhall be ſo unſufferable, as to provoke him to wiſh, that he never had any being at all. Or that forthwith he might be turned into nothing.</p>
                        <q>Secondly, I oppoſe common conſent. Where ſhall we pick out a man but will ſay (if he ſpeak from his heart) that he were better to vaniſh into a thou and nothings, then to be caſt into hell? What is the reaſon why <note place="margin">
                              <hi>M. Maſon's Addit. p.</hi> 20.</note> men are ſo afraid of hell, when they are touched to the quick with the conſcience of their ungodly lives, and the expectation of eternall vengeance, that with <hi>Job</hi> they curſe their birthday, and wiſh an hundred times over, that they had never been, or might ceaſe to be, that ſo they might not come into that place of torments; becauſe they judge a being there to be incomparably worſe, then no being any where? And why are men, who are ſenſible of hell fire, ſo ſtrongly curbd and held in with feare of feeling it, even from dailing and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſinnes, but becauſe they apprehend it to be the moſt terrible of all terribles? feare of being annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted can never doe that which feare of hell doth.</q>
                        <p>And is he well in his wits that talkes of a thouſand nothings? I looked whereto it would come with ſuch like wild diſcourſes, even to runne out of common ſenſe at laſt. <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Yet all this that he diſcourſeth of, for the ſubſtance of it is no other, then <hi>Auſtine</hi> hath taken notice of in his very argument; and ſhewes the vanity of it, and the errour of man's imagination, conceiving the condition of being nothing, to be a condition of eaſe and reſt from ſorrow &amp; pain; againe aske the ſame men whether they would not be content to be turned into dogges, wolves, ſnakes, toades, rather then to be under the torments of hell fire; aſke againe whether they would not be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to be turned into devills, ſo they might be free from the torments of hell fire. Aske the Adulterour whether he would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to lye with an other mans wife all his daies, rather then to ſuffer (ſhall I ſay) the torments of hell fire? Nay rather then dye poſſeſt of the joyes of heaven. Aske this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour whether he would not be content to maintaine ſtiffly, that grace is given accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to workes, and that a man is juſtified by his workes, rather then ſuffer the paines of hell fire, yea though it were againſt his own conſcience. As for me were I a damned crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet according to this judgment which God hath given me co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that the glory of God's juſtice is manifeſted in my condemnation, though extreamity of pain would tranſport me into as wild wiſhes, as this Authour juſtifies; yet according to right reaſon I ſhould rather be content to ſuffer, then wiſh that I were turned into a bruit beaſt, or into a devill, or into nothing. I think the whole nation of ſober divines would juſtifie me
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56120:184"/>
in this undoubtedly God is able to worke me or any man to this reſolution without ſin.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If, becauſe men through feare of hell and expectation of eternall vengeance doe with <hi>Job</hi> curſe their birth day once, and wiſh they had never been; therefore it is better to be nothing then to be in hell: By the ſame reaſon, becauſe they doe no other then <hi>Job</hi> did, it muſt follow, that it was better for <hi>Iob</hi> to be nothing, then to be under ſuch torments. But if <hi>Iob's</hi> deſire was an unſober and unreaſonable deſire in this, why might not their deſire be as unſober and unreaſonable alſo, proceeding not ſo much from calme reaſon, as from the ſtrength of paſſion inflamed and diſordered through extremity of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We know that men upon the rack doe ſometimes make confeſſions, even againſt the light of their own conſciences. And feare of evill ſometimes diſtracts as much as the ſenſe thereof; as in him who hearing the ſentence of death paſſed againſt him at <hi>Paris,</hi> fell into a ſweat of blood. And it was wont to be ſaid, that <hi>pejor eſt malo, timor ipſe mali. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Spira</hi> in the time of his diſtraction confeſt as much of hell it ſelfe. And if one deſire, once having courſe, prove unreaſonable, why ſhould the renewing of it a thouſand times over prove leſſe unreaſonable. And let the judicious obſerve the hand of God, in ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Authour with ſuch giddineſſe even in this argument, (which he conceives of all other to be advantagious to his cauſe) ſo as at every turne to ſupplant himſelfe, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the ſhamefull nakedneſſe of his diſcourſe. As firſt, in talking of a thouſand nothings. Secondly, In putting the caſe of ſome curſing their birth day, but how? as <hi>Iob</hi> did. Now will any ſober man make the like collection of <hi>Iob's</hi> curſing his birth day, as this Author doth from others curſing theirs. Thirdly, and laſtly in calling hell fire the terrible of all terribles. Who ſeeth not that this proceeds in reference to ſuch things, which as they are feared, ſoe they may be felt; and ſuppoſing a ſubject exiſting, as to feare it before it comes, ſo to feele it when it is come but ſuch is not the condition of being nothing. And when he feignes us to conforme to his crude conceptions, namely to conceive annihilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be a thinge feared, he pleaſeth himſelfe in his owne fictions. He no where finds me to ſpeake of annihilation as a thing to be feared, no more then I ſpeake of it as of a thing that is to be felt. Onely I ſay that it is a condition no way deſirable by a reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no more then the ſuffering of hell fire. But whereas hell fire cannot be ſuffered of any unleſſe he hath a being, here is ſomething found deſirable, to wit the continuance of being. But in the condition of being nothing, there is not found any thing to be a fit Object of mans deſire.</p>
                        <q>The third thing which I oppoſe is common ſenſe; which judgeth paines, when they are extreame to be worſe then death. Hence it is that <hi>Job</hi> being tormented in his body by the Devill curſed his birth day, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified <note place="margin">

So that I wonder not a little at theſe wilde diſcourſes of this Authour. When he ſaith that even the ſtouteſt and hardeſt ſpirits would chooſe rather to have no bodyes at all, then bodyes tormented with the ſtone or gout, what other is this then to deſire that they were impaſſible; would they not deſire to have no ſoules too? and to be without ſenſe like ſtocks and ſtones? But let every ſober man judge whether this be a reaſonable deſire; what Chriſtian juſtifies <hi>Iob</hi> in curſing the day of his birth? What Martyr hath not rejoyced in ſuffering, not naturall diſeaſes, but the cruelleſt torments that moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, and ſpightfull Tyrants could deviſe to be inflicted upon them? And even to ſuffer other evills by courſe of nature brought upon us with patience, acknowledging the hand of God therein, and ſubmitting unto his will, juſtifying him as righteous in all his wayes, and holy in all his works, and condemning our ſelves: even this long a goe hath beene accounted for Martirdome in the judgement of Chryſoſtome. It is true ſuch proverbs have had their courſe in moſt nations. <gap reason="foreign">

And if it be urged that this holds true only in evills tolerable, not in caſe they prove intolerable.

Undoubtedly, if the glory of heaven poſſeſſe the ſoule, though the paines of hell ſeize upon the body, ſuch a one ſhall have more cauſe to rejoyce then to complain. Theſe courſes of <hi>Tiberius</hi> I had cauſe to take notice of in mine anſwer to M. <hi>Hord.</hi> For, whereas he ſlaundered our doctrine concerning the abſoluteneſſe of God's decrees, and conforming them to the cruell courſes of <hi>Tiberius:</hi> whereupon I ſhewed, that if ſuch compariſons were not odious, but allowable, we might in like manner compare God's courſes in puniſhing ſinne temporall with torment eternall, with courſes of <hi>Tiberius</hi> here ſpecified. And becauſe nothing hath a greater ſhew of cruelty in <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> then ſuch courſes of his as theſe. Hence they may with the ſame liberty conclude, that the divine Majeſty is cruell (which is a horrible thing to utter) and unjuſt in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men everlaſting in hell fire, for ſinnes committed by them for a very ſhort ſpace in the courſe of their lives. But let this Authour conſider, were heathen Princes more exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate againſt any then againſt Chriſtians, or were more cruell courſes taken againſt any then the ſervants of God. Yet did theſe Chriſtians prevent their bloody and barbarous deſires by murdering their ſelves? Did they not rejoyce in tribulation? Yet death they might well preferre before the ſweeteſt life. That they might enjoy the Lord Chriſt And <hi>Auſtine</hi> hath long agoe in this very argument ſhewed, that even in deſtroying themſelves they aimed at being at a ſtate of freedome from ſorrowes. So farre were they from affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting to have no being at all. And firſt, he diſtinguiſhes of the will as it ſignifies an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite naturall; or as it ſignifies an abſolute deſire. As it ſignifies nature or appetite naturall; ſo by no meanes can it deſire to have <hi>no being.</hi> All naturall deſire being for reſt, but nature findes no reſt in its deſtruction: Reſt of nature ſuppoſeth its being, and adds ſomewhat over and above thereunto, namely freedome from trouble, <hi>unde ſiquis dicat vellem non eſſe, magis quàm miſerum eſſe; reſpondebo, mentiris, quia cum miſerum nolis eſſe tamen vis.</hi> Thus

                           <hi>Durand</hi> analizeth <hi>Auſtin's</hi> diſcourſe hereupon. Then he proceeds to ſhew that the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berative appetite cannot affect not being, for the avoiding of evill, ſave only according to erroneous reaſon. All which this Authour takes no notice of, but pleaſeth himſelfe in his own confuſion. All creatures have in them, <hi>veſtigia Dei,</hi> ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> to wit, in reſpect of their being; But man is, <hi>Imago Dei.</hi> Shall right reaſon ſuggeſt the deſtroying of this for pain's ſake? <hi>Durandus</hi> proceeds &amp; ſhewes how according to erroneous reaſon a man may deſtroy himſelfe, by reaſon of ſome preſent miſerable condition urging him; conceiving that thereby he ſhall arrive to ſome ſecret exiſtence wherein he ſhall be free, as from the good things, ſo from the evill things of this world. <hi>Unde Aguſtinus ubi ſupra dicit, quòd aliqui urgente miſeriâ ſeſe interimu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, eo quòd confugiunt ubi melius fore putaverint.</hi> A ſecond manner is this, the vehemency of evill ſuffered may ſo over-cloud and trouble reaſon, as to make them conceive, that to have no being at all is better then to be in miſery, which is abſurd, ſaith he; for as much as the privation of evill is not good, but by reaſon of obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the contrary good; but no ſuch good can be obtained in being nothing, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men through errour of judgment may faigne it otherwiſe. In which caſe he makes choice of nothing (thinking to make choice of ſomething) and conſequently his election is erroneous, as <hi>Auſtine</hi> concludeth. But <hi>Seneca</hi> is the beſt flower in this Authours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſcourſe; and the cenſure which he paſſeth upon one <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> who, ſo he might live, would not care what torments he ſuffered. Where by the way I obſerved; that albeit this Authour repreſents the common ſenſe of heathens only in this. Yet all heathens were not of the ſame mind. Secondly, I obſerve that <hi>Seneca</hi> who cenſureth him did look for an immortall condition after death, which it ſeemes was no part of <hi>Mecaenas</hi> his Creed. And upon this ground his cenſure might proceed. And indeed otherwiſe it is very ſtrange that he ſhould cenſure him for effeminatenes, in reſpect of a reſolute mind to endure tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which we know full well is uſually accounted <hi>virile aliquid,</hi> rather then <hi>muliebre,</hi> the part of a man, more then the part of a woman. Thirdly, I find in <hi>Auſtine,</hi> that this was the opinion of <hi>Varro</hi> and the Stoicks, that it became a man to deſtroy himſelfe, rather then to endure ſome evills, and in this doctrine of theirs, he findes ſome contradiction to another doctrine of their own, which was this, <hi>Hanc eſſe naturae primam quodammodo &amp; maximam vocem, ut homo concilietur ſibi, &amp; propterea mortem naturaliter fugiat, This is the firſt and greateſt voice of nature, that man ſhould be at one with himſelfe, and therefore natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flieth death.</hi> And herein <hi>Auſtine</hi> himſelfe acknowledgeth them to deliver a truth. Now conſider, is a man at one with himſelfe when he deſtroyes himſelfe? Is he not rather at odds with himſelfe in making a man's fortitude to be a ſelfe deſtroyer? If ſo be that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be called fortitude, as there <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſpeakes: Or how can the duty of preſerving a man's ſelfe, be the greateſt voice of nature, if there be found a voice of nature counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding it, and commaunding a man to kill himſelfe? In ſuffering evills there is place for the exerciſe of patience, of true fortitude and magnanimity of mind: But in the utter deſtruction of nature there is no place for the exerciſe of any vertue: which vertue was ſo farre advanced by the Stoicks, as touching the power of it, as to be able to deſcend into <hi>Phalaris</hi> his Bull, as <hi>Cicero</hi> diſcourſeth in the laſt of his Tuſculane queſtions Yet not only great evills, for the inſufferable nature of them did urge them to deſtroy themſelves, but meaner evills moſt unreaſonably. What moved <hi>Cato</hi> to deſtroy himſelfe, but becauſe he would not come under <hi>Caeſar?</hi> His ſtout ſpirit could not endure ſubjection. Yet he read over <hi>Plato's</hi> diſcourſe of immortality the night before, and felt the edge of his ſword, which ſome cenſure as an argument of ſome puſillanimity. The Spaniard, who was whipt through <hi>Paris</hi> never changed his pace, affecting to maintaine the reputation of ſpaniſh gravity and reſoluteneſſe, though he ſmarted the more for it. And ſhall not our being in the likeneſſe and Image of God, be preferred before not being, though conjunct with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dolorous ſuffering: when this Authour will have <hi>no being,</hi> to be a lighter and leſſer evill then hell paines; doth he not moſt manifeſtly ſignifie that it is a burden more eaſie to be borne? Thus ere he is aware moſt contradictiouſly he ſuppoſeth that, even in not being, there is a being. For how is it poſſible that an evill can be borne, and that with more eaſe then ſome other evill, by him who hath no being at all. But let him ſtraine his wits to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe where firſt pain begins to be ſo great, that a man's utter deſtruction is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before it, ſeeing it is apparent that all pain is not ſuch.</p>

Here indeed upon <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 24, he ſaith, <hi>We muſt not hereupon think that Iudas had a being before he were born, becauſe a well being can agree to none but ſuch as have a being.</hi> Which argument Hierome doth not anſwer. For when he adds, <hi>ſed ſimpliciter dictum eſt, multo melius eſſe non ſubſiſtere quàm malè ſubſiſtere.</hi> This rather confirmes the antecedent, namely, that it had been well for <hi>Iudas,</hi> if he had not been; then gives any tolerable or colourable anſwer to the conſequence made therehence. And is not the authourity of <hi>Auſtine</hi> as good as the authourity of <hi>Hierome</hi> in this? <hi>Ianſenius</hi> embraceth <hi>Hieromes</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; but <hi>Maldonat</hi> doth not, but at large diſputes for another interpretation, the very ſame which I delivered before I were aware of <hi>Maldonates</hi> expoſition. And <hi>Ianſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> though he followes <hi>Hierome</hi> in expounding this place, yet he profeſſeth, that both <hi>Euthymius</hi> of old, and <hi>Caietan</hi> of late do underſtand this place in the ſame manner that <hi>Durandus</hi> doth, namely, <hi>de nativitate ex utero,</hi> of <hi>Iudas</hi> his bringing forth into the world, diſtinguiſhing his birth from his conception, <hi>ut ſit ſenſus, after this meaning, Bonum erat vel fuiſſet ei, ſi cum erat in utero matris ſuae non fuiſſet editus in lucem, ſed mortuus tunc fuiſſet; &amp; ſepulchrum ipſius uterus matris extitiſſet; ſi enim tunc mortuus fuiſſet non incidiſſet in tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam &amp; talem condemnationem, quantam &amp; qualem natus propter immenſum perditionis ſcelus erat excepturus. It had been good for him, if being conceived in his Mothers wombe he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been brought forth, but then had dyed, and his Mothers wombe had been his grave. For had he then dyed his condemnation had been nothing like ſo heavy, as now it is.</hi> Let me adde here <hi>Maldonat's</hi> interpretation of this place which is memorable. <hi>Of this paſſage ſome diſpute ſubtelly more then enough how it could be better for Iudas not to have been, whereas not to be is no good; to be damned is ſome good</hi> (meaning in reſpect of being) <hi>For he that is damned is ſomewhat and every thing that is, as it hath a being is good. Hierome ſignifies that ſome though Iudas had a being before he was born; and that Chriſt of purpoſe ſayd not, it were better for that man, if he had never been; but if he had never been born, to ſignifie that though he had not been born; yet he ſhould have had a beeing, and ſo to have had naturall good things without evill. I i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that Hierome herin noted the Originiſts, whoſe opinion was that as ſoules were from the beginning created, and each according to his merrit either to remaine without a body, or to be caſt into a body as into a priſon. And indeed Origen ſo writes on this place, as he ſeemes not to be farre off from ſuch an opinion. After the ſame manner allmoſt doth Euthinius interpret this. But ſuch like phraſes of ſpeech are not to be accommodated to the ſubtillty of the Schooles. For they ſpeak proverbiall ſpeeches and vulgar, which commonly are ſomewhat hyperbollicall, as Iob</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Why haſt thou brought me out of the wombe? would I had periſhed, that the eye might not ſee me, that I had been as if I had not been, from the wombe carried to the grave.</hi> And <hi>Ier:</hi> 20 14, 15, and <hi>chap:</hi> 33. <hi>Let the day periſh wherin I was born. For all theſe proceed not from any deliberate judgment of the mind; but by way of complaint, whoſe courſe is to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie evills. Chriſt therefore in like manner ſpeaks of Iudas, as it was to be thought he would ſpeak of himſelfe being in torment. Now it was very credible that he would ſay; I would I had never been born, it had been better for me never to have been born, then to ſuffer theſe paines: conſidering that Job and Jeremy moſt holy men have uttered the like ſpeeches, under farre leſſe ſufferings. Adde to this that Chriſt ſaith not, It had been better that Iudas had not been born</hi>

                           <hi>born; but that it had been better to him, to wit, in his opinion and judgment: As we ſee it befalls many ſuffering bitter evills, to preferre death before life, ſorrow &amp; pain before judgment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as without doubt to live is better then to dye.</hi>

Noſter Solomon externa tantum &amp; praeſentis vitae incommoda perpendit quae vere hydra eſt. Thus he ſpeakes allwaies having his eyes fixt upon the greatneſſe of the miſeries of this life, but Chriſt in an other reſpect pronounceth them bleſſed who ſuffer perſecution for righteouſnes ſake, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and for the cauſe of God, becauſe he conſiders ſpirituall and heavenly things, the Crowne of Glory laid up for them againſt the time to come. Our Solomon conſiders only outward things and the incommodities of this life preſent, which indeed is as it were a Serpent with ſeven heads.</hi> This is the firſt expreſſion of <hi>Mercer</hi> in his interpretation of this place, which is as much as to ſay, that, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakesherein according to the judgment of a naturall man.

In like manner as touching the durance of theſe ſorrows; if he ſayth that the ſuffering of hell pains for an hour, for a day, for a year doth not make a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be turned into nothing.

Then the queſtion is only of <hi>Miſeria paenae,</hi> whether it makes a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worſe then annihilatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate condition with ſin, which is the condition of the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned. Yet thus he carrieth it to ſerve his turn; whereas in <hi>Arminius</hi> his opinion, the ſinfull condition of the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, makes them more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable then thir torments. But if the torments of hell in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves are able to make a man in a worſe condition then to be turned into nothing, then an holy Angell or Saint ſhould chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be turned into nothing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuffer the tore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nts of hell. And the Schoole divines diſpute ſeverally of the miſery of ſinne, and the miſery of tore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nt, &amp; that with ſuch different reſolutions upon the point, as to maintaine, that albeit the miſery of torment is not ſo bad as utter a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet the miſery of ſinne, is. Yet therein I willingly profeſſe I am not of their mind. For
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56120:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what? are not the Children of God ſinners? Now what ſober Chriſtian will affirme, that it were better for them to be annihilated, then to be ſinners. If you ſay, therefore it is not better for God's children to be annihilated then to be ſinners; becauſe they are not only ſinners, but they are in the ſtate of grace. I proceed farther, and demand whether God's Elect before their calling, being yet in the ſtate of ſin, as <hi>Manaſſes</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> before their vocation, were better to be annihilated, then to be as they are. What if I am a ſinner, yet while I have any being I may mourne for my ſinne, I may ſerve God, I may enjoy his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in the pardoning of my ſinne, is not this a better condition then not to be, which is a condition conjunct as well with the deſtruction of ſanctity as of ſinne?</p>
                        <p>But the former argument, which he takes ſo much paines to enervate, he calls a ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall evaſion, and addes that ſo are all others of the like ſort, very magiſterially and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely. But what thoſe others are he doth not ſo much as name. Not ſo much as one of <hi>Auſtin's,</hi> whoſe diſcourſe alone I propoſed on this point; together with an argument of <hi>Durand's,</hi> neither of all which doth he touch, yet I am the marke ſet up by him to ſhoote at, not <hi>Durand,</hi> not any one of the School-men, not <hi>Auſtin</hi> whoſe diſcourſes alone I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. And as for the argument here mentioned, <hi>melius eſt eſſe, quam non eſſe; It is better to be then to have no being, therefore it is better to be in hell torment then not to be.</hi> This is neither argument, nor any of thoſe that I propoſed out of <hi>Durand</hi> and <hi>Auſtin. Durand's</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, <hi>To be annihilated is an univerſall deſtruction of man's nature, not only of his well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but of being: but hell paines is the deſtruction only of his well being not of his being.</hi> Neither is it anſwerable to the argument formerly mentioned by him <hi>p.</hi> 19. which was this. <hi>He that wants a being enjoyeth no good, but he that is tormented in hell hath a being, and by conſequence ſome thing that is good.</hi> Now this argument cometh nereſt to <hi>Maldonats</hi> diſcourſe upon that of our Saviour, ſpeaking of <hi>Iudas. It had been good for that man he had not been borne.</hi> Some, ſaith he, <hi>diſpute ſubtilly more then enough, how it could be better for Iudas, not to have</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">

                           <hi>been; whereas not to be is no good, to be damned is ſome good. For he that is damned is ſomewhat; And every thing that is, as it hath a being, is good.</hi> And we know that man's being is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good but a ſpeciall one, as being made after God's owne Image and likeneſſe. And looke with what judgment this Author extenuates, <hi>being humane,</hi> calling it a poore, little entitative good; with the ſame judgment he might extenuate Angelicall being. For even among Angells ſome have their portion in hell fire. But now he comes to his firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, <hi>that unavoidable damnation of ſo many millions can not be abſolutely and antecedently intended by God, without the greateſt injuſtice and cruelty.</hi> The queſtion is of the ſuffering of hell paines, whether it be worſe then to be annihilated? This Authour runnes upon the terme damnation, which is a civill and judiciall act. Is there no difference between theſe? They that ſay Chriſt ſufferd the paines of hell, doe they ſay Chriſt was damned? Then to ſpeake with a fuller mouth he puts in the damnation of ſo many millions, whereas if the damnation of one may be intended by God without injuſtice after what manner ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, undoubtedly the damnation of never ſo many millions may. Then he helps himſelfe with the Epithite of <hi>unavoidable</hi> added to damnation, and the terme <hi>abſolutely</hi> affixed to God's intention, to no purpoſe that I know, but to abuſe himſelfe and others by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; for feare leaſt the truth ſhould break forth to their conviction. To intend damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>avoidable,</hi> what is it but to intend it conditionally. And to intend damnation not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, is all one with to intend it conditionally. Now to intend the damnation of any man conditionally is with this Author as much, to intend his ſalvation as his damnation. Yet this he calls the intention of damnation. And <hi>Bradwardine</hi> hath long agoe maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and demonſtated by evidence of reaſon, that there is no conditionate will of God: And this Authour will not ſay (I ſuppoſe) that God did intend that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer hell paines conditionately, or that if he did inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it abſolutely, he was unjuſt in ſo doing. Now both D. <hi>Iackſon</hi> expreſly confeſſeth, that the diſtinction of <hi>will antecedent and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> is to be underſtood, not as <hi>touching the act of willing, but as touching the thing willed.</hi> And <hi>Gerardus Voſſius</hi> acknowledgeth that after the ſame manner muſt the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate will, which is aſcribed unto God, be interpreted. Now we willingly confeſſe that the thing willed and intended by God to Reprobates, namely, damnation, befalls none, but in caſe they dye in ſinne without repentance. And as already I have ſhewed not any of our Divines maintaine that God intended to damne any man but for ſinne. Only the maine point of difference between us is, as touching the conferring &amp; denying grace, even the grace of regeneration, the grace of faith and repentance. Herein we willingly confeſſe that God carrieth himſelfe merely according to the pleaſure of his own will, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.</hi> Now on this point this Authour keeps himſelfe cloſe, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56120:188"/>
earthes himſelfe within his own concealements, leſt he ſhould betray the bitter Leven of <hi>Pelagianiſme,</hi> in maintaining that <hi>grace is conferred according unto workes,</hi> which cannot be avoided by him, if once he comes to deale on this Argument. He thinks he hath great advantage in the point of Reprobation, and very free he is here, but declines the point of election, and point of conferring grace, which argueth a naughty diſpoſition, practiſing by indirect courſes to circumvent and ſuppreſſe the truth, rather then conferre any thing for the clearing of it: yet ſee his confuſed carriage in the very point. For when he ſpeakes of damnation avoidable and unavoidable, he takes no paines to manifeſt in what ſenſe he takes it to be avoidable; as whether by power of nature, or power of grace. Is it his meaning that any man's damnation is avoidable by grace? We deny it not. Or is it his meaning that it is avoidable by nature? we utterly deny this. But this man counts it his wiſedome not to ſpeake diſtinctly, but worke his advantage upon confuſion of things that differ; but let all ſuch take heed, leaſt utter confuſion be their end. But if it be his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that all men have power to avoid damnation if they will, to wit, in as much as they have power to beleive if they will, to repent if they will: I would he would deale fairely once, and come to this. The Scripture is expreſſe, <hi>That they that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God, that the naturall man diſcerneth not the things of God, that they are fooliſhneſſe unto him,</hi>

And the habits of them not to be a power to beleive and repent if a man would, but an habituall and morall inclination of them to believe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. And habits (as it was wont to be ſaid) <hi>Agunt ad modum naturae, doe worke after the manner of nature.</hi> And it is very ſtrang that ſupernaturall grace ſhould not. And long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe I have learnt in <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that to doe good, and obey God if a man will, is rather nature then grace. For the will alone is all in all as touching acts morall, good or evill; and till the will be changed, we are as farre off as ever, from performing any thing that is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the ſight of God. This is the peculiar glory of God's grace, <hi>To make us perfect to every good worke, and to worke in us that with is pleaſing in his ſight through Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and this he doth <hi>according to his good pleaſure.</hi> For grace is not conferred according unto <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 21. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13.</note> workes. That was condemned as a peſtilent doctrine long agoe in the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and all along in divers Councells againſt the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> How gladly ſhould I imbrace any delineation of this Authours opinion in the point of grace and free will, the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſeem to ſmell who he is by this which followeth. For I remember ſometime un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe hand I read it; namely, that, <hi>Plutarch ſpeaking of the Pagans, who to pacifie the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their gods, did ſacrifice to them men and women,</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>It had been much better with Diagoras and his fellowes to deny the being of a God, then confeſſing a God, to think he delights in the blood of men.</hi> But allbeit this ſupercilious and confident profeſſor be of <hi>Plutarch's</hi> mind in this, I willingly profeſſe I am not. I know no naturall reaſon why he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light more or leſſe in the bloud of beaſts, then in the bloud of men. Only it pleaſed him by the bloud of Bulls and Goats to repreſent the delight he took in the ſatisfaction made in the blood of his own Sonne. We know in what errand the Lord ſent <hi>Abraham</hi> three dayes journey, namely, to ſacrifice his Sonne upon mount <hi>Moriah;</hi> had not God hindred him it had been done; <hi>Abraham</hi> knew no other but that it ſhould be done, when he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his Sonne ſaying, <hi>My God will provide himſelfe of a burnt offering. Abraham</hi> did not <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.</note> break forth in this man's language, to ſay he would rather deny there was any God, then believe he delights in bloud; neither had he delighted in bloud, though <hi>Iſaak</hi> had been ſacrificed, but in the obedience of his ſervants. Nor had <hi>Iſaack</hi> received any loſſe by this. For <hi>Abraham</hi> knew that God was able to raiſe him from the dead. Did not <hi>Samſon</hi> ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice himſelfe. Chriſt was content to ſhed his precious bloud for us, and we by his grace ſhall be content to ſhed our bloud for him, &amp; that according to his good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Let heathens thus diſcourſe who are nothing acquainted with the powers of the world to come; but a foule ſhame it is for Chriſtians to comply with them. But, <hi>how much rather,</hi> ſaith this Authour, <hi>may we ſay it were better to be an Atheiſt, then to beleive or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him to be a devourer of the ſoules of men.</hi> Yet I cannot be perſwaded it is better to be an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> then to belive even this. For I muſt not give ground to a confident <hi>Theologue</hi> for his bare proteſtation ſake. What is it I pray for God to be a devourer of the ſoules of men? Is it any other then to be a tormenter of of them in hell fire? Now doth not this man believe that God deals ſo with millions of ſoules? Doth not he profeſſe, that, <hi>the breath of the Lord as a river of brimſtone doth kindle that fire?</hi> what <hi>out recuydance</hi> hath poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56120:188"/>
the ſpirit of this <hi>Cavaliere</hi> that he ſhould flaunt it to the world in this manner? It ſeemes his atcheivements known ſo well to the world have puft him up, that he ſwells with the conceit of it: And 'tis enough for him now to brave it with proteſtations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of arguments, wherein having known him ſo well heretofore, I cannot but wonder at the poverty of his ſpirit; he will battle ſo long upon his credit and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the world, that it will crack at length; and he prove bankrupt: So that proteſt what he will no man will truſt him for a groat. Now in that manuſcript of his, which it was my hap ſometime to have a view of, his proteſtation upon the book of that ſaying of <hi>Plutarch</hi> was ſomewhat different, thus. <hi>I proteſt unto you, I think it was leſſe diſhonour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the bleſſed Trinity to ſay with the Atheiſt there is no God, then to forme ſuch a God, as the decree of Reprobation maintained by the Contraremonſtrants, maketh him to be.</hi> This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation though it had courſe in private, yet here it is changed that it might not ſee the light of the Preſſe. For it is well known that this toucheth nearely a whole <hi>Synod</hi> of the Church reformed; and that countenanced by King <hi>Iames</hi> and divers worthy Divines of this Kingdome ſubſcribing to it, ſome yet living, and two of them in <hi>Apice Epiſcopali, in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall dignity.</hi> Yet what is that doctrine of the <hi>Contraremonſtrants</hi> that he pincheth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? It is well knowne that their generall tenet is that God ordaines no man to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but for ſinne; ſome difference there hath been, and is about the ordering of God's decrees, which is merely <hi>apex Logicus,</hi> &amp; what my opinion is thereabouts is well known; namely that in no moment of time or reaſon doth God ordaine any man to damnation, before the conſideration of ſinne, more particularly thus; that all beſides the Elect, God hath ordained to bring them forth into the world in their corrupt maſſe, and to permit them to their ſelves, to go on in their own waies, and ſo finally to perſevere in ſinne, and laſtly to damne them for their ſinne, for the manifeſtation of the Glory of his Juſtice on them, &amp; of the greater mercy on the veſſells of mercy, whom he hath prepared unto glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; inaſmuch as he hath of his free grace provided better for them, then for millions of others. Only as touching the grace of regeneration, of faith and of repentance; he did not only ordaine of his mere pleaſure to beſtow that on his Elect, and not on Reprobates; but in time he doth of his mere pleaſure conferre that grace on ſome; denying it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. This doctrine is ſo diſhonourable to the <hi>Trinity</hi> in this Authors judgment, as that to deny there is any God at all, he thinks to be leſſe diſhonourable: A prodigious aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! We have the leſſe cauſe to be moved, when he preferred the annihilation of our natures, before the ſuffering of hell paines. When he ſeemes to preferre the annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the bleſſed Trinity, before the renouncing of his own vile fancies. As for that of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> true it is, the god's of Paynims ſought only the deſtruction of thoſe that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, and that not of their bodyes but their ſoules alſo. The true God put <hi>Abraham</hi> once upon the ſacrificing of his Son, for the tryall of his faith and obedience, but percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his obſequious readineſſe, took a courſe to reſtraine him. Of him it it is true, <hi>He ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth both man and beaſt, and the eyes of all doe wait upon him, and he gives them meat in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he heareth the cry of Ravens, and not a ſparrow lights upon the ground without his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; The very Lyons roaring after their prey do ſeek their meat at (the hands of) God.</hi> Yet if he be pleaſed to ſave our ſoules, we have reaſon to ſubmit unto him in doing what he will with our bodies, which yet one day he will raiſe, glorious bodyes, when mortality ſhall be ſwallowed up of life. We acknowledge no other end of man's creation, and of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Divine Acts of God, but his own glory. For even there where <hi>Solomon</hi> profeſſeth, <hi>God hath made even the wicked againſt the day of evill,</hi> he withall acknowledgeth, that both them and all things, <hi>he hath made for himſelfe.</hi> God of his mere pleaſure created all, but of his mere pleaſure he damneth none. But every one that is damned is damned for his ſin, &amp; that willfully committed &amp; contumaciouſly continued by them that come to ripe yeares. For as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith <hi>Libertas ſine gratia non eſt libertas, ſed contumacia: Liberty without grace, is not liberty, but willfullneſſe or contumacy.</hi> I come to the ſecond part of his firſt argument.</p>

The charge is made in the firſt place, the proofe laſt. All that he labours to prove here is, that God is not the Author of ſinne. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath beſtowed, or rather caſt away a whole book on this crimination, to him <hi>Arminius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs <hi>Perkins,</hi> telling him that he ſhould have anſwered <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> I have taken ſome paines to performe that taske upon that motion of <hi>Arminius.</hi> I would I could receive from this Authour a reply to any materiall particular thereof, the rather becauſe I underſtand in part his Zeale for <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his age, correcting the harſh exceptions he hath made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in his younger dayes. And let every indifferent Reader compare this Authors diſcourſe, with that diſcourſe of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and judge indifferently what an hungry peece this is in compariſon to that of <hi>Bellarmines;</hi> And whether his paines had not been better beſtowed in replying upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my anſwer thereunto, then to adde ſuch ſcraps as theſe to that full table of <hi>Bellarmin's</hi> proviſion; and whether theſe deſerve any anſwer, that whole diſcourſe of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> being refuted throughout. <hi>Bradwardine</hi> diſputes the queſtion, <hi>Si &amp; quomodo Deus vult &amp; non vult peccatum.</hi> I ſay he diſputes it indifferently on both ſides; and let every Schollar judge and weigh, whether it be not a very ponderous argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſider well his reſolution, and where he differrs any thing from our Divines in this <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerving how frequent the Scripture is in teſtifying God's hand to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative in abominable courſes, thereupon writes a Treatiſe. <hi>De occultâ Dei providentiâ in malo;</hi> in all which he exactly conformes himſelfe to Scripture expreſſions. And theſe and ſuch like vile Criminators may as well taxe God's word for making God the Author of ſinne, as <hi>Calvin;</hi> who moſt accurately conformes himſelfe to the teſtimonies of Divine Scripture. I remember to have heard a diſputation ſometimes at <hi>Heidelberge</hi> on this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, where <hi>Copenius</hi> the Preſident or Moderator made manifeſt, that look upon what grounds they criminated <hi>Calvin</hi> for making God the Authour of ſinne; upon the ſame grounds they might criminate the very word of God to make him the Author of ſinne. For <hi>Calvine</hi> throughout in his expreſſions conformes himſelfe to the language of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt. Yet, what one of our divines can he produce, affirming that, <hi>God takes pleaſure in ſinne. Piſcator</hi> confeſſeth that, <hi>God taketh no pleaſure in the death of him that dyeth,</hi> upon that place in <hi>Ezechiel;</hi> how much leſſe <hi>in wickedneſſe.</hi> And he illuſtrates it in this manner: For albeit it cannot be denyed, but that God willeth the death of him that dyeth. <hi>For he is the God to whom vengeance belongeth;</hi> yet he takes no pleaſure in it. Like as a ſick-man would be content to take a bitter potion for the recovery of his health; yet he takes no pleaſure in that bitter cup. And in like manner, albeit, <hi>God hardened Pharaoh's heart that he ſhould not let Iſrael goe;</hi> and as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>hardeneth whom he will.</hi> Whereby it comes to paſſe infallibly that they doe not obey the Goſpell, as appeareth by the objection following.

Our Adverſaries ſo denying him to be the Author of evill, as withall they deny him to be the Authour of any good in the actions of men. We on the contrary take care, ſo to maintaine that God is not the Author of ſinne, that withall we maintaine that he is the Author of all good, both morall and naturall, and much more ſupernaturall. Yet as I have conſidered the ſeven reaſons of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to this purpoſe collected out of the Antients; ſo I am content to take into conſideration the three reaſons produced by this Author. 1.

Let all the Univerſities of the world be judge between us of the ſhamefull irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of this diſcourſe. His ſyllogiſme is hypotheticall; for the firſt propoſition is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall and conditionall. Now all ſuch ſyllogiſmes by the rule of all Schooles muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed either from the negation of the conſequent, to the negation of the antecedent; or from the affirmation of the antecedent, to the affirmation of the conſequent; but no ſuch proceſſe is made here. And indeed it ſhould be framed thus to inferre the propoſition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to be proved. <hi>If God be the Authour of ſin, then he is worſe then the Divell; but God is not worſe then the Divell; therefore he is not the Authour of ſin.</hi> But this Authour diſputes after no ſuch manner. But his affection carrying him all along to caſt ſome foule aſperſion on our Doctrine in ſome particular or other, and being withall in heat of paſſion, he doth moſt ſhamefully involve and entangle himſelfe And indeed quite beſides his preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he aimes only at this to prove that our doctrine concerning God's powerfull and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall decree, doth more make God the Authour of ſin then the Devill, which is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aliene from that he propoſed in this place. Yet I am willing to doe him this favour, to help a lame Dogge over the ſtile, and to expedite him in this Argument, whereof he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo dext'rouſly deliver himſelfe though quite beſides the purpoſe. Thus therefore the argument ſhould proceed according to his irregular intention. <hi>If God doth will and procure ſins by a powerfull and effectuall decree, which cannot be reſiſted, then is God worſe then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. But by the doctrine of our Divines God doth will and procure ſins by a powerfull and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall decree which cannot be reſiſted; therefore by the doctrine of our Divines, God is worſe then the Devill.</hi> Thus have I endeavoured to bring this argument to ſome ſhape, which had no tolerable proportion before. Now let me ſhew the corrupt nature of it, that the Reader may diſcerne what ſpirit he breathes, that is the Authour of it in a mixture both of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and abominable profanenes. And firſt I begin with the major propoſition. And here firſt let the Reader judge whether it be not this Authours opinion, that, God doth will <hi>and procure ſin by ſome decree, though not by a powerfull and effectuall decree that cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted.</hi> For otherwiſe did he acknowledge every will of God as it ſignifies his decree, to be <hi>powerfull, and effctuall and irreſiſtable,</hi> what need he cumber his Reader with ſuch unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Epithites, caſt in like lumber only to trouble the courſe of diſputation? Now if he grants that God doth will and decree ſin by a powerfull and effectuall decree. 1. He muſt contradict himſelfe. For formerly he cited, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 66. 4, to prove that men in wicked courſes, <hi>doe chooſe the things that God would not.</hi> 2. If God doth will it, but not by <hi>a powerfull and effectuall, &amp; irreſiſtable decree,</hi> let him ſhew what that decree is, whereby he wills ſins. Now this is commonly accounted a decree conditionall; and let him ſpeak plainely then &amp; tell us upon what condition it is that God doth will and procure ſin in the world, and I am verily perſwaded he is to ſeek what to anſwer. 3. If God doth will and decree it, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoided, but it muſt be, by a powerfull and effectuall decree which cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted; ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaith plainly ſpeaking of his decree, that it <hi>cannot be reſiſted.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe conſiderations I am perſwaded, that this Authour doth utterly deny that God doth at all will ſin, or decree that any ſuch thing ſhall come to paſſe in the world, &amp; that theſe attributes of <hi>powerfull, and effectuall, &amp; irreſiſtable,</hi> are uſed by him not for diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſake, but meerly for amplification, that ſo he might ſpeake with a full mouth. Now having brought this Authour home to himſelfe, and delivering himſelfe and his meaning plainely, I am very willing to cope with him on this point. Yet what need I, having ſo fully diſputed the point in a certaine digreſſion in my <hi>Vindiciae lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Digrees.</hi> 4. The title whereof is this, <hi>Whether the holy one of Iſrael without any blot to his Majeſty may be ſaid to will ſin.</hi> And forthwith I anſwer, that, <hi>God may be ſaid thus farre to will ſin, in as much as he will have ſin to come to paſſe.</hi> And for explication ſake it is added, that whereas God will have all the good things of the world, whether naturall, morall, or ſpirituall come to paſſe by his working of them: Only evill things he will have come to paſſe by his permitting them. But this Authour affects to worke upon the ignorant; and he doth not affect to trouble their braines with anſwering my reaſons, leaſt thereby he ſhould raiſe many ſpirits, and afterwards prove unable to lay them. And this diſcourſe of M. <hi>Hord's</hi> ſome of that ſect thought good to have it coppied out, and communicated to people in the Country, as accommodated to their capacities, and ſo more fit to promote their edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the plauſible way of <hi>Arminian</hi> religion: well therefore in the proofe of this tenet, namely, that God will have ſin come to paſſe by his permiſſion. I prove firſt by Scripture. <hi>God hath put in their hearts</hi> (that is in the hearts of the 10 Kings) <hi>to fulfill his will.</hi> Now marke what is the object of God's will, in the words following, <hi>and to agree, and give their kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es unto the beaſt untill the words of God ſhall be fulfilled:</hi> now by giving their Kingdomes unto the beaſt, is not to depoſe or dethrone themſelves, or to part with their Kingdomes, but only to ſubmit their regall authority to the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the beaſts wrath

againſt the Saints of God.

Now this the holy Ghoſt makes the object of Gods will, and their agreement thus to execute the Popes Antichriſtian pleaſure is ſaid to be Gods worke. For God is ſaid to put it into their hearts to doe this evill of his. Of diſobedient perſons the Apoſtle profeſſeth that <hi>they are ordained to ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble at Gods word,</hi>

Then conſider what the Apoſtles with one conſent teſtifie concerning thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Acts.</hi> 4. 28.</note> acts committed againſt the holy ſon of God, namely that both <hi>Herod &amp; Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate with the Gentiles &amp; people of Iſrael, were gathered together to doe what Gods hand &amp; his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell had before determined to be done.</hi> This the Apoſtles deliver to the very face of God in their prayers &amp; holy meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And let every Chriſtian conſider, whether it the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had not made mention of this, &amp; any one of us had uſed the like prayer &amp; medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this Author &amp; all that are of his ſpirit, would not have beene ready to ſpit in our faces &amp; cry us downe for notorious blaſphemers. Yet the Apoſtles indued with the ſpirit of God feared not to be found guilty of violating the Lords holineſſe in all this. Hence I proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the paſſages of the Old Teſtament for the confirmation of the ſame truth. As name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that whereas <hi>the deſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy Land begun by the Aſſyrians, finiſhed by the Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> could not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e to paſſe without many enormous ſins. Who can deny, that it was Gods will that theſe things ſhould come to paſſe, conſidering that <hi>Aſſur</hi> himſelf is acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God to be the <hi>rod of his wrath and the ſtaffe of his indignation,</hi> whom God would <hi>ſend againſt an hypocriticall nation, &amp; againſt the people of his wrath would he give him a charge to take the ſpoyle, &amp; to take the prey, &amp; to tread them downe like the mire in the ſtreets?</hi> Hence I proceeded to ſhew how that it is Gods uſuall courſe to puniſh ſin with ſin. Now when God exerciſeth his judgments, ſhall not thoſe things juſtly be ſaid to come to paſſe by his will, which are puniſhments of foregoing ſinnes? See the judgment of God denounced againſt <hi>Amaziah</hi> the Preiſt of Bethell. <hi>Thou ſayſt prophecy not againſt Iſrael, &amp; drop not thy word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the houſe of Iſaac.

I proceed to prove the ſame truth by evidence of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Firſt becauſe God permits ſin to come to paſſe as all confeſſe, though he could hinder it, if it pleaſed him, &amp; that without all detriment to the free will of the creature why then doth he permit it? but becauſe he would have it come to paſſe, &amp; accordingly <hi>permiſſion</hi> is reckoned up by Schoole Divines amongſt the ſinnes of Gods will, like as allſo is Gods commandment. Now what God commandeth if it be done, it is ſaid to come to paſſe by the will of God, albeit the things that God commandeth, ſeldome; the things he permits, allwayes come to paſſe; according to the common tenet of Divines, even Voſtius &amp; Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius not excepted. Againe it is the common opinion of all, that therefore God permits ſin, becauſe he can and will worke good of it, which plainly ſuppoſeth that ſinne ſhall come to paſſe if God permits it, &amp; conſequently it muſt needes be the will of God, it ſhall come to paſſe. Thirdly it is granted on both ſides that the act of ſin is Gods worke in the way of an efficient cauſe, not the outward act onely which is naturall, but the inward act of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56120:191" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will which is morall, even this as an act is the worke of God: How can it be then but the deformity and vitiouſneſſe of the act, muſt come to paſſe God willing it, though not working it, conſidering that the deformity doth neceſſarily follow the act, in reference to the creatures working it, though not in reſpect of Gods working it? Laſtly all ſides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that God can give effectuall grace, whereby a man ſhall be preſerved from ſin infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly. Wherefore as often as God will not give this grace which is in his power to give, doth it not manifeſtly follow that he will not have ſuch a man preſerved fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſin?

In this caſe it muſt needs be that the will of man is free, and that alſo which God willeth ſhall come to paſſe, to wit by that will of man.</hi> Now obſerve what in the next place he concludeth hence <hi>In theſe caſes therefore it is true that the worke of ſin, which man will doe, muſt needs be, though man doth not will it of neceſſity.</hi> And in his <hi>concord of predeſtination and free will.

Hugo de ſancto Victore</hi> 1. <hi>De ſacr.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 13. <hi>When we ſay God willeth that which is good, it ſounds well; but if we ſay God willeth evill it is harſh to eares, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth a pious mind admit of the good God, that he willeth evill, for hereby he thinkes the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is that God loves and approves of that which is evill, &amp; therefore the pious mind abhorres it, not becauſe that which is ſaid is not well ſaid, but becauſe that which is well ſaid is not well underſtood.</hi> To theſe I adde the teſtimony of Bradwardine at large. A man reputed ſo pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in thoſe dayes, that the Kings prospe ous ſucceſſe in thoſe dayes was cheifly imputed unto his piety; who followed him in his warres in France as Preacher in the camp. In the laſt place I make anſwer to the Sophiſticall arguments of Aquinas and Durandus, and the frothy diſputation of <hi>Valentianus,</hi> all of them ſtanding to maintaine the contrary. Now let every ſober Chriſtian judge of this Authors propoſition, when he ſaith that <hi>If God doth will and procure ſin &amp;c. he is worſe then the Devill.</hi> For I have made it evident by variety of Scripture teſtimonyes, by reaſon, and alſo with the concurrence of diverſe learned Divines; that it is Gods will that ſin ſhould come to paſſe, even the horrible out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages committed againſt the holy ſonne of God were before determined by Gods hand and counſell. Now what followes herehence by this Authours dicourſe; but that the holy Apoſtles yea and the Spirit of God do make God worſe then the Devill. So little cauſe have we to be impatient, when ſuch horrible blaſphemyes are layd to our charge, when we conſider what honourable compartners we have in theſe our ſufferings. Yet ſee the vanity of this conſequence repreſented moſt evidently; For albeit the will of Gods decree be powerfull &amp; effectuall and irreſiſtable, and conſequently every thing decreed thereby ſhall come to paſſe powerfully, effectually, irreſiſtibly, yet this reſpects onely the generality of the things eveniency, not the manner how For onely things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſhall by this irreſiſtible wil of God, come to paſſe neceſſarily: But as for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent things, they by the ſame irreſiſtable will of God ſhall come to paſſe alſo; but how? not neceſſarily but contingently; that is with a poſſibility of not comming to paſſe. Now the free actions of men are one ſort of contingent things They therefore ſhall infallibly come to paſſe alſo by vertue of Gods irreſiſtible will; but how? Not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily but contingently, that is with a poſſibility of not coming to paſſe in generall as they are things contingent: And in ſpeciall they ſhall come to paſſe not contingent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly onely but freely alſo; that is with a free power in the Agents by whom they are acted to doe otherwiſe. Yet there is another difference according to the morall condition of theſe actions For if they are good and ſo farre as they are goood they come to paſſe by Gods working of them, but if they are evill, and ſo farre as they are evill they come to paſſe onely by Gods permitting; according to that of <hi>Auſtin. Non aliquid ſit niſi omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fieri velit, vel ſinendo ut fiat, vel ipſe faciendo. Not any thing comes to paſſe, but God willing it either by ſuffering it</hi> (to wit in caſe it be evill) <hi>or himſelfe working it</hi> (to wit in caſe it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56120:192" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be good.) And according to that eleventh Article of Religion agreed upon by the Arch-Biſhop, and Biſhops, and the reſt of the Clergy in Ireland, which is this; <hi>God from all eternity did by his unchangeable counſell ordaine whatſoever ſhould come to paſſe in time; yet ſo as thereby no violence is offered to the wills of the reaſonable creatures, and neither the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nor the contingency of the ſecond cauſes is taken away but eſtabliſhed rather.</hi> Farther conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is confeſſed by all, that God concurres in producing the act of ſinne, as an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe thereof not morall, but naturall. And Aquinas himſelfe, though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes that, <hi>Voluntas Dei eſt malorum,</hi> Becauſe indeed as <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore</hi> obſerves by the will of God is commonly underſtood in this caſe <hi>Voluntas approbans; his will approving it, and loving it.</hi> And ſo it is juſtly denyed that <hi>God doth will evill things,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the evill of ſinne. Yet Aquinas profeſſeth, and diſputes and proves that <hi>Actus pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati eſt a Deo, the Act of ſinne is from God.</hi> Like as the Act of walking is from the ſoule, though the lamenes in walking ariſeth from ſome diſeaſe in the legge. Now the Devill concurres not in this manner to any act of ſin; neither is the efficient cauſe thereof in the Kinde of a Naturall efficient, but onely Morall by tempting and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading. What therefore? ſhall we conclude as this Authour doth without feare or witt or honeſty, that by the confeſſion of all men God is hereby made worſe then the Devill? To what abominable courſes do the wilde witts and profane hearts of theſe men expoſe them? The greateſt works of <hi>Satan</hi> in moving men to ſin are comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der blinding and hardening of them. Now theſe operations are alſo attributed to God. And like enough he doth uſually performe them, not by the miniſtry of his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, but by the Miniſtry of <hi>Satan</hi> and his Angells of Darkeneſſe, as we read. 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 21. 22. 23. <hi>Ioh:</hi> 13. 27. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 3. What then ſhall the Devill ſo farre poſſeſſe our hearts as to break forth into ſuch intolerable blaſphemyes as to conclude hereupon that God is bad, or worſe then the Devill. The providence of God I willingly confeſſe is wonderfull, and myſterious in this, like unto the Nature of God, to be adored rather then pryed into. So this providence to be dreaded rather then for ſatisfaction to every wanton and wild witt to be ſearched into. Yet all confeſſe that the Lord could hinder all this if it pleaſed him, and rebuke <hi>Satan</hi> and reſtraine the power, and ſtop the courſe of ſin, and prevent occaſions leading thereunto, but he will not, and why? But becauſe he knowes it becomes his allmighty power and wiſdome infinite, rather <hi>exmalis bene facere, quàm malum eſſe non ſinere, To worke good out of evill, then not at all to ſuffer evill.</hi> Laſtly what meanes this Authour to carry himſelfe ſo as to betray ſo ſtrange ignorance in mitigating <hi>Satans</hi> operation in tempting unto ſin; as if this were not ſufficient to make him the Authour of ſin. Eſpecially conſidering the reaſon that moves him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, which is meerely the delight that he takes in diſhonouring God, and being a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate ſpirit himſelfe to make as many as he can partakers of the ſame deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. For <hi>cupiunt perditi perdere,</hi> ſayth Cyprian, <hi>cum ſint ipſi paenales, quaerunt ſibi ad poenam comites;</hi> being damned themſelves they deſire to damne as many as they can: And being bound in chaines and kept to the judgement of the great day, they deſire to have as many companions as they can in <hi>drinking of that cup of trembling, and ſucking the very dreggs of that cup of trembling and wringing them out.</hi> For as the Hiſtorian ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. <hi>Maligna eſt calamitas, &amp; cum ſuo ſupplicio crucietur, acquieſcit alieno; Calamity makes a man of a ſpightfull nature, and when himſelfe is tormented, he takes content in this that others ſuffer with him.</hi> And as the Oratour obſerves, <hi>Nullum adverſarium magis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuas, quàm qui non poteſt vivere, poteſt occidere.</hi> No adverſary more to be feared, then he who cannot live himſelfe, yet can kill another. This makes a coward reſolute; when he muſt needs dye, he will fight like a mad man, and kill all he can. I ſay what meanes this Authour to carry the matter hand over head, as if it were without queſtion; That he is not the Authour of ſinne; who onely is a Morall cauſe thereof, but rather he that is the naturall efficient: whereas great Divines carry it to the contrary. As name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Dominicus Soto in his firſt booke of nature and grace chap: 18. <hi>Although</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>there are many that thinke it hard to explicate, how in the hatred of God, which hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and indiviſible malignity, God can be the cauſe of the entity, but not of the fault: Yet this is not ſo hard to be underſtood.</hi> Then he proceeds to ſhew how this may be. Firſt laying for his ground what it is to be the cauſe of ſinne, thus; <hi>In morall actions he is altogether, and is judged to be the cauſe, who by a law, or help, or counſell or favour or perſwaſion moves any one either to good or evill.</hi> Obſerve I pray the doctrine of this School-Divine directly contrary to that which this Authour ſuppoſeth without all proofe. For in the judgement of Dominicus Soto, he onely is to be accounted the cauſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56120:192"/>
of another mans ſinne, who is the morall cauſe thereof, as by tempting, counſelling, perſwading thereunto, And upon this ground he proceeds to free God from being the Authour of it after this manner. <hi>But as for God he by all theſe wayes moves his creatures to that which is good and honeſt, and none at all to evill.</hi> Neither is the doctrine of Dominicus Soto alone; but the common doctrine of the Divines of Salamancha, as Molina con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth in his diſputation 23. And albeit Molina the Jeſuite were of another opinion. Yet Vaſquius the Jeſuite profeſſeth that he was ever of the ſame minde with Dominicus Soto and the Divines of Salamancha in this; In his 129 diſputation upon the firſt part of his Summes. As for Proſper he hath no ſuch argument. But firſt obſerve the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereunto he anſwereth, was made againſt the Doctrine of Auſtin; as the Authour acknowledgeth. Whence it followeth that looke how this Authour chargeth our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, after the ſame manner was the doctrine of Auſtin charged above 1200 yeares agoe; let the indifferent hereby take notice of the congruity of our doctrine with the doctrine of Auſtin in this particular, and the congruity of this Authours ſpirit in charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us with the ſpirit of the Semipelagians in charging Auſtin after the ſame manner. Secondly conſider the objection there made t'is this. <hi>Quod quando inceſtant Patres filias, &amp; matres filios; vel quando Servi Dominos occidunt ideo fiat, quia ita Deus predeſtinavit, ut fieret. When father commit inceſt with their Daughters, and mothers with their ſonnes. Or when ſervants kill their Lords; therefore this comes to paſſe, becauſe God hath ſo predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that it ſhould come to paſſe.</hi> Conſider, in this objection the fault of theſe abominable courſes is not layd upon thoſe that commit them, but onely upon God; as if Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination did worke in ſuch a manner, as to compell men or women to commit ſuch and ſuch abominations. And ſo Proſper conceives the Argument to proceed, as if this were their intention. And accordingly makes anſwer. <hi>Si Diabolo objiceretur quòd tali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um facinorum ipſe Author, ipſe eſſet incentor,</hi> were it objected to the Devill that he were the Authour of ſuch ſinnes, and did inflame men to the committing of them (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the Devills courſe and not Gods) <hi>yet I thinke,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>that the Devill might in ſome ſort diſburthen himſelfe of this crimination, &amp; talium ſcelerum patratores de ipſorum voluntate vinceret, and make it appeare that their owne wills were the committers of ſuch ſinnes. Quia etſi delectatus eſt furore peccantium, probaret tamen ſe non intuliſſe vim cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum. Becauſe though he tooke pleaſure in the fury of ſinners, yet might he juſtifie that he forced no man to ſinne.</hi> After the ſame manner proceeded the 11. objection of the Galles; <hi>Quod per potentiam Deus homines ad peccata compellit, God by his power compells men to ſin.</hi> And as touching the notion of predeſtination it is true the Antients uſed that onely in reference to thoſe thinges which were wrought by God. <hi>Nihil ergo talium</hi> (to wit of wicked actions) <hi>negotiorum Deus predeſtinavit ut fieret.</hi> Predeſtination being onely <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Enchirid: c.</hi> 95.</note> of ſuch things, which come to paſſe by Gods working of them. Yet the ſame Auſtin profeſſeth that ſuch things which come to paſſe by Gods permiſſion (of which kind are all manner of ſinnes) even thoſe came to paſſe God willing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though not by Gods predeſtinating of them. And as touching Senacherib who was ſlaine by his owne ſonnes; the Lord profeſſeth ſaying, <hi>I will cauſe him to fall by the ſword in his owne land.</hi> And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Eſa:</hi> 37. 7. <hi>Amos.</hi> 7. 16.</note> Amaziah the Prieſt of Bethel the judgment was pronounced from the Lord, <hi>Thy wife ſhall be an harlot</hi> And whatſoever comes to paſſe it is Gods will it ſhould come to paſſe, ſayth Auſtin, how much more that which comes to paſſe in the way of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 I come to his ſecond reaſon to examine whether he carryeth himſelfe any thing more handſomly in that. <hi>If God be the Authour of ſinne he cannot be the puniſher of ſin.</hi> This argument is better ſhaped then the former; but forthwith he tells us that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in juſtice the puniſher of that whereof himſelfe is the Authour. Wherein are two particulars neither of which were expreſſed in his argument, the one is the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it to the ſame ſinne whereof he was the Authour, which was not expreſſed in the Argument. And without this application the Argument is of no force. For earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Magiſtrates are ſinners, yet the puniſhers of ſinne in others, yea of the ſame kind of ſinne. As though a Magiſtrate be a profaner of the name of God, yet he may execute the law on them who doe profane the name of God, and that juſtly. Then what is it that makes a man the Author of ſinne? It is well knowne, that though it be unlawfull for a man to permit ſinne, if it be in his power to hinder it, yet unleſſe God permit ſinne, it cannot be committed by any, <hi>Nos certe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin, ſieos in quos nobis poteſtas eſt ante oculos noſtros perpetrare Scelera permittamus, rei cum ipſis erimus. Quam vero innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilia ille permitit fieri ante oculos ſuos, quae utique ſi voluiſſet nullâ ratione permitteret. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely</hi>
                           <pb n="60" facs="tcp:56120:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <hi>if we ſuffer thoſe, over whom we have power, to commit ſinne, we ſhall be guilty together with them. But how innumerable are the ſinnes which he ſuffers to be committed before his eyes, which if he would, he could hinder, ſo that by no meanes they ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e to paſſe.</hi> Or is he the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of ſinne who is the efficient cauſe of the act of ſinne? <hi>It is Aquinas</hi> his doctrine, that, the act of ſinne is from God, and that in the kind of an efficient cauſe; and it is commonly received to be the firſt cauſe in the kind of efficients, ſubordinate to none, and all other ſubordinate to him. Nay more then this <hi>Scotus</hi> profeſſeth, and after him the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> that, God determineth the will to every act thereof (though ſinfull) as touching the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof, but how? Surely no otherwiſe then to come to paſſe agreeably to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; neceſſary acts neceſſarily, free acts freely. So <hi>Barwardine</hi> maintaines that God neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitates the will of the creatue; but how? To performe acts thereof freely. Suppoſe they did maintaine that God in his omnipotency did impoſe a neceſſity upon our wills, as <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arez</hi> imputes to our Divines that they ſo teach. Yet in this caſe <hi>Suarez</hi> the Jeſuite will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie them, that therein they deliver nothing that either doth include contradiction, or <note place="margin">
                              <hi>De auxil. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>num.</hi> 7.</note> that doth exceed God's omnipotency. Neither did I ever meet any colour of reaſon, why God might not as wholy determine the will to any free act thereof, as concurre with the will to the producing of the ſame act. And that in the concurrence of God and man to the ſame act, the firſt cauſe ſhould be in ſubordination to the ſecond; or the ſecond cauſe not in ſubordination to the firſt, is againſt all reaſon, and obnoxious to manifold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, as I have ſhewed in my <hi>Vindiciae.</hi> Whereas for God to move a creature to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">
                              <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Digreſ.</hi> 7.</note> act of his congruouſly to his nature, and ſo to determine him, is moſt agreeable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and nothing at all obnoxious to contradiction. And yet notwithſtanding I ſee noe ſufficient reaſon to conclude theſe determinations, as touching things naturall, ſuch as is the ſubſtance of every naturall act, there being a power to performe that in a naturall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. Of ſupernaturall acts the caſe is different. It ſeemes to me enough, that God will have this or that evill come to paſſe by his permiſſion. For when God created the world out of nothing; what tranſient action of God can be imagined, when there was no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at all for any ſuch tranſient action to worke upon; God's will was ſufficient to have that to exiſt which before had no being: And why may not the will of God be ſufficient for the exiſtence of the motion of each creature after it hath exiſtence? But ſuppoſing theſe determinations of the creatures wills to be neceſſary, if God will not determine them to good what will follow herence? Surely nothing but evill; unleſſe man can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelfe to that which is good without God. For as for ſimple concurrence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſubordination in working, as I ſaid before, that cannot be affirmed without palpable and groſſe contradiction, as I have proved in the digreſſion formerly mentioned, proceed we yet farther. I know nothing doth more intimately concerne God's ſecret providence in evill, then the hardning of the creature to diſobedience. Now the Scripture which is the very word of God, and the dictates of the Holy Ghoſt doth plainly and expreſſely teach, that albeit God commanded <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let Iſraell goe, yet withall he hardened his heart that he ſhould not let Iſraell goe for a long time, which refuſall of his was wilfull and preſumptuous diſobedience. In like ſort as touching obedience and diſobedience to the Goſpell, the Apoſtle tells us plainly that, <hi>God hath mercy on whom he will,</hi> to performe the one, <hi>and whom he will he hardeneth,</hi> thereby expoſing them to the other. And hereupon this objection is made, <hi>Why then doth God complaine</hi> (to wit, of man's diſobedience) <hi>for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> And we know what anſwer the Apoſtle makes hereunto. <hi>O man who art thou that diſputeſt with God? ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power of the clay of the ſame lump to make one veſſell unto honour, another unto diſhonour?</hi> Now will any ſober Chriſtian conclude herehence that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>God hardned Pharaoh that he ſhould not let Iſraell goe,</hi> therefore he is the Authour of ſinne. <hi>The Lord hath bid Shimei to curſe David.</hi> Conſider what <hi>Auſtine</hi> writes upon this. <hi>Quomodo dixerit Dominus huic homini maledicere David, quis ſapiens &amp; intelliget? Non e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim jubendo dixit, ubi obedientia laudaretur; ſed quod ejus voluntatem proprio vitio ſuo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam, in hoc peccatum judicio ſuo juſto &amp; occulto inclinarit, ideo dictum eſt, Dixit ei Dominus. How ſaid the Lord to this man that he ſhould curſe David; Who is wiſe and he ſhall underſtand? For he ſaid this not by commanding Shimei ſo to doe, in which caſe his obedience had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; but in as much as Shimei's will through his own vitiouſneſſe being evill, the Lord incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it to this ſinne by his juſt and ſecret judgment.</hi> Thus ſaith he, <hi>The Lord uſeth the hearts of the wicked to the praiſe and benefit of the good: ſo he uſed Iudas betraying Chriſt: ſo he made uſe of the Jewes crucifying Chriſt. And how great good did he procure therehence to all believers? Who alſo uſeth the Divell who is worſt of all, yet he makes beſt uſe of him to exerciſe and prove</hi>
                           <pb n="61" facs="tcp:56120:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <hi>the faith and piety of the godly. So he wrought in the heart of Abſalom to refuſe the counſell of Achitophell, and make choice of that counſell which was nothing profitable. Who may not well tremble in the contemplation of thoſe Divine judgments, whereby the Lord workes in the hearts of wicked men whatſoever he will, yet rendring unto them according to their merits.</hi> Then he proceeds to give other inſtances of Scripture to manifeſt God's working in the hearts of men, and when he hath done, he concludes in this manner; <hi>His &amp; talibus teſtimoniis divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum eloquiorum ſatis, quantum exiſtimo, manifeſtatur operari Deum in cordibus hominum ad inclinandas eorum voluntates quocun<expan>

By theſe and ſuch like teſtimonies of Divine Scripture, I take it to be ſufficiently manifeſted, that God doth worke in the hearts of men, to incline their wills whitherſoever he will, either to thoſe things that are good, of his mercy, or to ſuch things that are evill, for their deſerts, in the way of judgment, which is ſometimes known, ſometimes ſecret, but alwaies juſt. And all this he ſhewes, to be wrought by God without prejudice to the freedome of their wills.</hi> And why ſhould <hi>David</hi> pray after this manner. <hi>Lord incline mine heart to thy teſtimonies, and not to covetouſneſſe;</hi> If it were not in God's power to incline <hi>the hearts of men to covetouſneſſe?</hi> Yet I truſt no ſober Chriſtian will conclude from this prayer of <hi>David,</hi> that God by executing ſuch a power is the Author of ſinne. Laſtly this argument is drawne from God's juſtice, ſo is the third, which is to confound rather then to diſtinguiſh the reaſons produced by him. We ſay that God cannot poſſibly be the Author of ſinne, the neceſſity of his nature ſtands in oppoſition thereunto. For firſt ſin hath no cauſe efficient but deficient only, as long agoe it hath been delivered by <hi>Auſtin.</hi> 2ly, a cauſe deficient or defective is either in a culpable manner, or in a manner nothing culpable. As for example, that Agent is defective culpably, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther omits the doing of that which he ought to doe; or omits to doe it after that manner which he ought to doe it: now I ſay it is impoſſible that the divine nature can be defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive either of theſe waies, and conſequently it is impoſſible that he ſhould be the Author of ſin, whereas he ſaith this is <hi>Proſper's</hi> argument it is untrue. He ſaith indeed it is againſt reaſon, <hi>that God who damnes the Devill ſhould will that any man ſhould be a Servant to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell:</hi> but forthwith he expounds himſelfe. 1. Expounding what that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition is <hi>of being the Devills ſervants,</hi> whereof the objection did proceed. Now the objection was this, <hi>That the greateſt part of men were created for this, that they ſhould doe, not the will of God, but the will of the Devill:</hi> Now this objection ſaith <hi>Proſper</hi> proceeds from the <hi>Pelagians: Qui Adae pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum tranſiiſſe in omnes diffitentur, who deny the ſin of Adam to have paſſed unto all.</hi> So that, <hi>to doe the will not of God, but of the Divell,</hi> is to be in the ſtate of naturall corruption, and under the power of originall ſinne, whereby they are not God's ſervants, but the Devills; this is not the condition of God's children in the ſtate of Grace. Now <hi>Proſper</hi> ſhewes how originall ſinne paſſeth over all, not by the will of God; and ſecondly, how it paſſeth over all by the will of God: Not by the will of God <hi>inſtituente;</hi> but by the will of God <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicante:</hi> His words are theſe. <hi>Haec ſervitus non eſt inſtitutio Dei, ſed judicium. This ſlavery of ſinne which came upon all by Adam's ſinne is not God's inſtitution but his judgment.</hi> As much as to ſay it came not upon a man by God's firſt creation, but by his judgment upon him, becauſe of his firſt trangreſſion; ſo that if divine judgment be the will of God; it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Proſper</hi> is ſo farre from denying that ſlavery to have come upon all men by the juſt will of God, as that he expreſly acknowledgeth it. It is true as <hi>Fulgentius</hi> ſaith, that, <hi>God is not the Authour of ſinne, but the revenger of it.</hi> And it is as true that it is as juſt with God to puniſh ſinne with ſinne, as Scripture juſtifies; as St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> obſerves, and improveth at large divers Scriptures to this purpoſe, in his fifth Book againſt <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Pelagian,</hi> and third <hi>chap. Tertullian</hi> in ſaying, <hi>he is not to be accounted the Authour of ſin, who is the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yea the condemner of it,</hi> falls directly upon the ſame ground that <hi>Dominicus Soto,</hi> with the Divines of <hi>Salamancha,</hi> and <hi>Vaſquez</hi> the Jeſuites, in explicating what that is which makes me to be the Authour of a morall action; as namely, by commanding, by counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it, and perſwading it; and indeed condemnation is but conſequent to a law forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this or that. Now it is apparent that God in this reſpect ought to be accounted the Authour of every good action, but of none that is evill. For he commands only that wich is good, and counſelleth and perſwadeth thereunto, but forbiddeth and diſſwadeth every thing that is evill. Of this no notice at all is taken by this Authour, neither taketh he any care to ſhew what that is, that maketh any agent juſtly to be accounted the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of ſinne.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 His third reaſon is all one with the former as drawne from God's juſtice and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and his being Judge of the world. For it is the property of the Judge to condemne
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56120:194"/>
tranſgreſſours, whereupon his former Argument inſiſted, and that allſo was drawne from God's juſtice. But I remember well what the <hi>Poet</hi> coupleth together when he ſaith,</p>

For when after the great Deluge in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> men began to be multiplied upon the face of the earth, they conſulted how they might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify themſeves againſt the like inundation for the time to come; and thereupon encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves ſaying, <hi>Goe to let us build us a City and a town, whoſe top may reach unto the</hi>

As <hi>Gamaliel</hi> ſometimes adviſed the high Prieſt with his counſell to take heed, leſt <hi>they were found even fighters againſt God.</hi> It is true this Author no doubt perſwades himſelfe that he fights for God, in as much as he affects to free him from being the Author of ſin. But let not the ſimple Reader be deluded with ſhewes, but ſeriouſly conſider whither all this doe, which he makes about the point of Reprobation doth not clearly tend to the overthrowing of God's free grace in election: which is ſo much the more foule, becauſe he doth it underhand; as conſcious to himſelfe of his owne impotency to impugne it openly, or fearing the generall oppoſition of our Church againſt him, &amp; therefore he practiſeth to undermine it. And this I have found to be his courſe divers years agoe in his private undertakings to draw proſelytes unto him, namely to decline the point of grace, &amp; of election, to deale only upon Reprobation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there to put his concurrent to begin, as if he would have a young Divine to inform a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xagenarian, as I have ſeen under his own hand. But ſee the hand of God upon him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding his language, as when he ſtands for <hi>Reprobation evitable &amp; avoidable,</hi> &amp; reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth his adverſaries for maintaining Reprobation inevitable &amp; unavoidable. This is the phraſe of his Schoole. For I do not remember to have met with it any where, but in him, &amp; his diſciples: Now what man of common ſenſe doth not obſerve this phraſe to be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able only to things that are to come; but of a contingent nature; ſo that they may be avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; declined; but by no means apply able to things already done, &amp; that more then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand years agoe. For what ſober man could heare with patience another diſcourſe of the avoidable nature of <hi>Noah's</hi> flood now in theſe daies, &amp; to maintain that it is at this day avoidable: what fuſtian like to this? Might he not as well take liberty to diſcourſe of the Aequinoctiall paſticruſt? It was wont to be ſaid, that this alone God himſelf could not perform; namely to cauſe that which is done to be not done. As <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Eth</hi> relates a ſaying of one <hi>Agatho</hi> to that purpoſe. Now reprobation is confeſſed by all to be of the ſame age with election; &amp; election was as the Apoſtle tels us, performed by God before the foundation of the world And is not this Author then beſides himſelf, when he pleads for evitable &amp; avoydable Reprobation. But albeit this Author makes the worſt of our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and expreſſions, yet I will not requite him by making the worſt of his, that were baſe &amp; inglorious, and to be overcome. I will therefore hearken to the Apoſtles counſell where he ſaith, <hi>Be not overcome with evill, but overcome evill with good.</hi> I will make the beſt of his, and according to the diſtinction of God's will uſed in Schooles; as it is taken either <hi>quoad actum volentis,</hi> or <hi>quoad res volitas, as touching the act of him that willeth, or the things willed.</hi> So I will imagine that he ſpeaks of Reprobation, which is the will of God, not as touching the act of God Reprobating &amp; making ſuch a decree, but as touching the thing decreed, &amp; this thing decreed he will have to be of an avoidable nature. Now this we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly grant, &amp; utterly deny, that this any way hinders the abſolutenes of God's decree. We ſay with the 11 article of the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that <hi>God from all aeternity did by his unchangeable councell ordain whatſoever ſhould in time come to paſſe, yet ſo as hereby neither the contingency nor liberty of the ſecond cauſes is taken away, but eſtabliſhed rather.</hi> So that whereas we ſee ſome things come to paſſe neceſſarily, ſome contingently; ſo God hath ordained that all things ſhall come to paſſe that do come to paſſe; but neceſſary things neceſſarily, contingent things contingently, that is, avoidably &amp; with a poſſibility of not comming to paſſe. For every Univerſity Scholar knows this to be the notion of contingency, yet will not I content my ſelfe with the article of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for this <hi>Aquinas</hi> thus diſtinguiſheth. For <note place="margin">1. <hi>p. quaeſt.</hi> 19. <hi>art.</hi> 8.</note> having propoſed this queſtion, <hi>Whether the will of God doth impoſe a neceſſity upon the things willed.</hi> To this queſtion this Author with whom I deale would anſwer affirmatively, ſaying, it doth impoſe a neceſſity on all ſuch things, or at leaſt obtrude ſuch an opinion upon us; &amp; himſelf undoubtedly thinks that in caſe Gods will be abſolute it muſt cauſe a neceſſity upon all things willed therby, both which are utterly untrue, &amp; this laſt utterly denyed by <hi>Aquinas.</hi> For firſt, every will of God is abſolute in the judgment of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> which I prove
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56120:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thus; That will which hath noe cauſe or reaſon thereof is abſolute: This propoſition I preſume this Authour will not deny: But the will of God hath no cauſe in the judgment of <hi>Aquinas</hi> therefore every will of God is abſolute by his doctrine: Yet this abſolute will of God impoſeth not a neceſſity upon all things willed by him, but only on ſome things. <note place="margin">1. <hi>p.</hi> 19. <hi>art.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp; quaeſt.</hi> 23. <hi>art.</hi> 5. <hi>Corp.</hi>

                           <hi>diſtinction of God's will. For when a cauſe is effectuall and powerfull to worke, the effect follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the cauſe, not only ſo farre as to be brought to paſſe, but alſo as touching the manner of its coming to paſſe. Therefore ſeing the will of God is moſt effectuall, it not only followeth that thoſe things come to paſſe, which God will have come to paſſe, but that they come to paſſe after the ſame manner alſo, after which he will have them come to paſſe. Now God will have ſome things come to paſſe neceſſarily and ſome things contingently, that there may be an order in things for the perfection of the world. And therefore for the producing of ſome effects he hath fitted cauſes neceſſary, which cannot faile, by which effects are brought forth neceſſarily: And for the producing of other effects, he hath fitted cauſes contingent, ſuch as may faile in working, from which effects are brought to paſſe contingently.</hi> So that upon ſuſpicion that God doth will a thing, that thing ſhall certainly and infallibly come to paſſe; but how? Not allwaies neceſſarily or contingently. And that certaine and infallible eveniency of things is called alſo neceſſity in the Schooles; but not <hi>neceſſity ſimply,</hi> but only <hi>upon ſuſpicion,</hi> which may well conſiſt with abſolute contingency. But to make the point yet more cleare; Let us diſtinctly conſider the things decreed; For they that have an evill cauſe delight in confuſion, and feare nothing more then the light of diſtinction. Now the things decreed by Reprobation are either deniall of Grace, which is joyned with the permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinne: Or damnation for ſinne, according to that on <hi>Aquinas, Reprobation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes</hi>

                           <hi>the will of permitting ſinne, &amp; inflicting damnation for ſinne.</hi> Now both the permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinne, and damnation of God's part are his free acts; and therefore come to paſſe freely. But upon ſuppoſition that God will deny a man Grace, it is impoſſible that ſuch a man ſhould have grace. Secondly, ſecluding grace, there is noe actuall tranſgreſſion for which a man is damned, but may be avoided; man having power for that naturally; though naturally he have noe power to performe every good act. The reaſon is becauſe amongſt good acts ſome are ſupernaturall, as the acts of the three Theologicall vertues, Faith, Hope, and Charity: But noe ſinfull act is ſupernaturall, all ſuch are naturall. Now it is confeſt on all hands that, notwithſtanding man's corruption by reaſon of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne, yet he hath ſtill power and free will to performe any naturall act, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he hath free power to abſtaine from it. So that <hi>Iudas</hi> had free will to abſtaine from betraying his Maſter; After he had betrayed him, he had free power to abſtaine from deſtroying himſelfe; ſo that as theſe ſinnes of his for which he was damned were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable by him, in like manner his damnation for theſe ſinnes was avoidable. And allbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it God had determined that <hi>Iudas</hi> by Divine permiſſion ſhould betray his Maſter, and deſtroy himſelfe, according to to that of <hi>Auſtin, Iudas electus eſt ad prodendum ſanguinem Domini; Iudas was ordained to betray his maſter.</hi> And that of the Apoſtles jointly. <hi>Of a truth againſt thy holy Son Ieſus both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and people of Iſraell were gathered to doe what thy hand, and thy counſell had before determined to be done. Acts:</hi> 4. 28. Yet herehence it followes only, that it was <hi>neceſſary</hi> (to wit, upon this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely, of the Divine ordinance.) <hi>that theſe things ſhould come to paſſe,</hi> namely, both <note place="margin">

                           <hi>Iudas</hi> his betraying of Chriſt, and <hi>Herods</hi> mocking of him, and <hi>Pilates</hi> condemning him, and the peoples crying out away with him, together with their preferring of <hi>Barrabas</hi> a murtherer before him, and the Souldiers crucifying him. But how came it to paſſe? Not neceſſarily, but contingently, that is in this Authours phraſe evitably and avoidably, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as much as it was joyned with an abſolute poſſibility to come to paſſe otherwiſe; Nor with a poſſibility only but with a free power in the agents to have forborne all theſe contumelious carriages of theirs towards the ſon of God. For both <hi>Iudas</hi> had free will to abſtaine from betraying him, and <hi>Herod</hi> with his <hi>Herodians</hi> could have abſtained from their contumelious handling of him, and <hi>Pilate</hi> from condemning him, and the Preiſts and people from conſpiring againſt him; and the Souldiers from crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, only they had no power to abſtaine from all or any of theſe vile actions in an holy manner, as no man elſe hath power to abſtaine from any evill in a gracious manner, without grace: Yea without the Grace of regeneration which alone plants in us both faith in God, and a love of God to the very contempt of our ſelves, and no performance of any good or abſtinence from any evill, is acceptable
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56120:195"/>
with God unto eternall life, unleſſe it proceed from this faith and this love. That which is here produced out of <hi>Marlorate</hi> is a ſtrange ſpeech, and ſuch as I never read or heard from any before: and ſuch, as whereof I can give no tolerable conſtruction. And is it fit that every extravagant paſſage that is found in any Writer of ours ſhould be brought forth to charge our doctrine with? It were a fitter ſpeech for a Papiſt who maintaining the abſoluteneſſe of Reprobation, doth withall maintaine an apoſtacy from grace, which we do not, If <hi>Marlorate</hi> had any ſuch opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſings therein to himſelf, &amp; to his own Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes What Divine of ours maintains that God hath decreed to damne any man otherwaies then by way of puniſhment for ſin continued in unto death without repentance? Had he ſpoken of Good works morall only, it is true any hypocrite is capable of them; and none taſte deeper of Damnation then hypocrites. But as for the worke of true faith &amp; true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; it is the generall profeſſion of our Divines, that as faith and the ſpirit of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance once given, never faile, ſo they ſhall infallibly bring a man unto everlaſting life, and free him from condemnation. But any thing ſerves this Authors turn to vent his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack: And I am perſwaded, there is not one more of all our Divines that he can ſhew to concurre with <hi>Marlorat</hi> in this. And if there were is it fit their improvident &amp; inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate expreſſions ſhould be caſt in their teeth that avouch them not, but rather conceive them to be void of all ſobriety? <hi>Brentius apud Marloratum in illud, Ioh.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>Omnem palmitem in me non ferentem fructum tollet, &amp;c.

                        <p n="2">2. The decree of Reprobation as touching one part of it, cannot be executed without ſin; For it is a decree of inflicting damnation for ſin, ſo that there is no place for damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where ſinne and that as a meritorious cauſe preceeds not. I had thought this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour needed not to runne out to <hi>Piſcator</hi> and <hi>Maccovius</hi> for proofe of this; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Arminius</hi> nor the Authour is of any other opinion I am confident, then
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56120:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the decree of damnation cannot be executed on any without the precedency of ſin in the party who is to be damned. But there is another part of Reprobation For as <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>it includes the will of permitting ſin.</hi> Now the execution of this decree, which conſiſts in the permitting of ſin, doth not require the precedency of ſinne. For when God firſt permitted the Angels to fall, this permiſſion of his did not require any precedency of ſinne in them; nor the permiſſion of <hi>Adam</hi> to fall; it cannot be ſaid without manifeſt contradiction, that it did. For before the firſt ſinne there was no ſinne. <hi>Piſcator</hi> ſaith that, <hi>God created men for this very purpoſe that they might fall;</hi> he ſaith, <hi>hoc conſilio,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, <hi>with this purpoſe,</hi> not, <hi>for this purpoſe;</hi> to wit, <hi>to permit them to fall;</hi> And God purpoſing this, purpoſed that they <hi>ſhould fall by his permiſſion.</hi> For <hi>Arminius</hi> confeſſeth that in caſe God permits a man to will this or that, <hi>Neceſſe eſt ut nullo argumentoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> genere perſuadeatur ad nolendum. It muſt needs be that no argument ſhall perſwade him to will that, which God permits him to will.</hi> And that it is good that evill ſhould come to paſſe by God's permiſſion, both <hi>Auſtine</hi> hath affirmed, &amp; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſubſcribed. And ſhall it not be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for God to will that which is good? Undoubtedly neither juſtice puniſhing, nor mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy pardoning, can be manifeſted without ſin, either to be puniſhed, or pardoned, or both: neither is it credible to me that this Authour thinks otherwiſe. And is not the manifeſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God's mercy on ſome, and his juſtice on others, the ſupreme end of God's providence towards mankind, and conſequently by the moſt received rules of Schooles firſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, even before the permiſſon of ſinne? For if the permiſſion of ſinne were firſt intended, then by the ſame rule of Schooles, it ſhould be in the laſt place executed; that is, God ſhould firſt manifeſt his mercy and juſtice in pardoning ſome, and puniſhing others, and afterwards ſuffer them to ſinne; ſuch is the learning and judgments of theſe Divines. And as for the foreſight of ſin, it is apparent, that it preſuppoſeth God's purpoſe to permit it; and more then that, it preſuppoſeth the fruition of it. Now it is well knowne, that ſinne in its own nature is meerly poſſible. How comes it to paſſe, that from the condition of a thing meerly poſſible, it hath paſſed into the condition of a thing future? This cannot be done without a cauſe; and that cauſe muſt be eternall; for the effect was eternall. For from everlaſting ſinne was future; for from everlaſting God knew it to be future. Now there is nothing everlaſting, but God himſelfe, therefore he muſt needs be the cauſe of this tranſition whereby a thing meerly poſſible in its own nature became future. And therefore, either by his knowledge he was the cauſe thereof, or by his will and decree. Not by his knowledge; for that rather ſuppoſeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be future, then makes them ſuch. It remaines therefore that the will of God, and that alone makes every future thing to paſſe out of the condition of a thing meerly poſſible, into the condition of a thing future, and that from everlaſting. Let this Authour ſatiſfie this argument, and I will eaſe him of all further paines, and lay down the bucklers before him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is untrue that by our Doctrine Reprobates doe unavoidably ſinne. I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy demonſtrated the contrary. For as I ſaid, <hi>Malum ſemper habitat in alieno fundo,</hi> every actuall ſinne is a naturall act; a worke of grace may be ſupernaturall as touching the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the act, ſo is not the worke of ſinne, but allwaies naturall. Now no Chriſtian that I know affirmes that a man in the ſtate of ſin is bereaved of free will in things natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. Nay we generally confeſſe, he hath free will in things morall, only as touching things ſpirituall he hath no freedome left therein: therefore as I ſaid before, <hi>Iudas</hi> might have naturally forborne to betray his Maſter; naturally forborne to deſtroy himſelfe. If ſome object, the common opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Divines is, that in a ſtate of nature there is <hi>noe libertie for ſinne.</hi> I anſwer; firſt out of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that this is to be underſtood of ſinne in generall, <note place="margin">

Though a man that is reprobated of God cannot obtaine Grace,</hi> (for how ſhould he obtaine it if God will not give it? will they ſay that Grace is given according unto workes?) <hi>yet that he falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this or that ſinne, this is a contingent thing, and proceeds from his own free will.</hi> So ſay I eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſinfull act committed by man in the ſtate of naturall corruption, is committed freely in ſuch ſort that he might have abſtained from it, but I doe not ſay that he could abſtain from it in a gracious manner. But whether he doth that which is good, he doth it not in a gracious manner; ſo that ſtill he ſinneth more or leſſe, and all by reaſon that as yet he hath neither faith in God, nor love of God, which are the fountaines of all gracious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, both in doing that which is good, and in abſtaining from that which is evill. As for <hi>Zanchi's</hi> ſaying, <hi>That God holds Reprobates ſo faſt that they cannot but ſinne.</hi> This act of God is no other then his denying them grace to breake of their ſinnes by repentance, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56120:196"/>
to turne unto God. Now the Apoſtle profeſſeth that as, <hi>God hath mercy on whom he will, ſo he hardeneth others,</hi> even <hi>whom he will,</hi> in denying this grace unto them. And marke what objection he ſhapes hereupon, <hi>thou wilt ſay then why doth he yet complaine?</hi> (to wit of men's diſobedience: for of nothing elſe doth the Lord complaine.) <hi>For who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> Obſerve the chaines wherewith God holds them faſt irreſiſtably, to wit the chaines of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duration. Let the Authour therefore charge St. <hi>Paul</hi> as well as <hi>Zanchy</hi> for making God the Authour of ſinne, and indeed he might have abounded in paſſages out of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture alleadged to the ſame end, whereunto he alleadgeth theſe out of our Divines; yea and Papiſts too. But <hi>Piſcator, Zanchy,</hi> and <hi>Calvine,</hi> theſe are his proper markes to ſhoote at, ever ſince he learnt in his age to correct the errours of his youth in taking frivolous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> As for a neceſſity of ſinning brought upon all by the ſinne of <hi>Adam. Arminius</hi> acknowledgeth it, and this <hi>Arminius</hi> is acknowledged by <hi>Corvinus</hi> in his anſwer to <hi>Lilenus.</hi> Only God takes it away from his Elect at the time of their calling and regenerating, and leaves it upon the reſt; and who can ſay black to the eye for this? Will we not give him libertie to have mercy on whom he will, and harden whom he will? Then let us fly in the face of <hi>Paul</hi> as well as <hi>Calvine</hi> &amp; <hi>Zanchy</hi> for ſo plainly teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this. The hardneſſe of men's hearts is the immediate cauſe why they obey not God's word; But there is another cauſe alſo that our Saviour takes notice of, and that is this; That God doth not regenerate them, or hath not elected them. Of this our Divines may well take notice, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> before hath done the like. The Iſraelites profited neither by hearing of God's word, nor by the ſeeing of his mighty workes, I ſay by none of theſe did they profit unto repentance; and what was the reaſon hereof? Surely the hardneſſe of their hearts, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſignifies, <hi>Thou art a ſtiffe-necked people.</hi> Yet he takes notice of another cauſe and that is this, <hi>Yet the Lord hath not given our hearts to perceive, nor eyes</hi>

Here by the way as touching <hi>Piſcator,</hi> I muſt fetch after mine anſwer in his behalfe, to that which in the entrance to this Section was delivered of him, and overſeen by me. For this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour confeſſing that our writers have never ſaid directly in <hi>terminis, that God is the cauſe of ſinne,</hi> which introduction of his is the very ſame which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> uſeth, oppoſing our Divines on this very argument, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Deamiſſione gratiae &amp; ſtatu peccati. cap.</hi> 4. Afterwards by a parentheſis brings in an exception of <hi>Piſcator,</hi> and <hi>ſome other of the blunter ſort,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out naming one of them. And though he name <hi>Piſcator</hi> yet he quotes no place; for if he had, he ſhould withall direct his Reader to the grounds whereupon <hi>Piſcator</hi> affirmes this, namely that, <hi>God is the cauſe of man's fidelity.</hi> And it is the very place formerly mentioned in theſe words. <hi>He that is of God heareth God's words, ye therefore heare them not becauſe ye are not of God</hi> now what reaſonable ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can deny, but that it is a ſin not to heare God's words; then doth not our Saviour plainly profeſſe, that the true cauſe hereof is, becauſe they are not of God? Now if to be of God in this place doth ſignifie God's Election, then the cauſe of their ſinnes hereby is made God's not electing of them. But if this phraſe, <hi>To be of God,</hi> ſignifie God's regenerating of them, as I thinke it doth, then God's not regenerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them is made the cauſe of this their diſobedience in not hearing God's word's: and indeed the evill of ſinne hath noe efficient cauſe but deficient only, as <hi>Auſtine</hi> hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered long agoe. And God is not bound to any, either to elect him, or regenerate him; ſo
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56120:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that in failing to regenerate ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he doth not <hi>deficere,</hi> or <hi>faile</hi> in any culpable ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ner: now let every indifferent Reader judge, whether here be not, <hi>Dignus vindice nodus a knot wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be looſed;</hi> &amp; it will require ſome worth of learning in him that ſolves it. And is it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent for this Authour to cenſure a man for a concluſion made by him out of the word of God, without ſhewing the faultineſſe either of his interpretation thereof, or of his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence framed therehence? So that this Author's wit &amp; cunning is more to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended in not ſpecifying the place where <hi>Piſcator</hi> delivers this doctrine, then either his learning or his honeſty. He was loath to raiſe ſpirits, &amp; afterwards to prove unable to lay them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus I anſwer in behalfe of <hi>Piſcator;</hi> though God her by me made the cauſe why ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e heare not God's words, to wit, in as much as he doth not regenerate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor give the eies to ſee, nor eares to heare, &amp; an heart to perceive according to that of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Yet he doth not make God any culpable cauſe, neither indeed is he any culpable cauſe, while he failes <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Deut:</hi> 29. 4.</note> to performe ſo gracious a worke towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the reaſon whereof is this. He and he alone is a culpable cauſe, who failes in doing that which he ought to do: ut God all be it he doth not regenerate a man, yet he failes not of doing that which he ought to doe. For it is no duty of his to regenerate any man; for he is bound to none. Now to be the Authour of ſinne is not only to be the cauſe thereof, but to be a culpable cauſe thereof. Undoubtedly God could preſerve any man from ſinne if it pleaſed him, and if he doth not, he is nothing faulty. Secondly I anſwere that in true account, God is only the cauſe, <hi>why</hi> our naturall infidelity is not healed, our corruption not cured. Like as a Phyſitian may be ſaid to be the cauſe why ſuch a man continues ſicke in as much as he could cure him, but will not: Soe God could cure the infidelitie of all, but will not. Only here is the difference, the Phyſitian may be a culpable cauſe, as who is bound to love his neighbour as himſelfe; but God being bound to none, is no culpable cauſe of man's continuance in ſinne, and in the hardneſſe of his heart, albeit he can cure him, but will not. As for <hi>Piſcator's</hi> ſaying here mentioned, <hi>Reprobates are appointed preciſely to this double evill, to be puniſhed everlaſtingly, and to ſinne; and therefore to ſinne that they may be juſtly puniſhed.</hi> Hereing are two things charged upon <hi>Piſcator.</hi> 1. That Reprobates are preciſely appointed by God to periſh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingly. To this I anſwer that noe <hi>Arminia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           </hi> that I know denies <hi>Reprobates to be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God to everlaſting damnation.</hi> All the queſtion is about the manner of appointing them; namely whether this appointment of God, proceeds meerly according to his meer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or upon the foreſight of ſinne. We ſay it proceeds meerly according to the good pleaſure of God, and not upon the foreſight of ſinne preceding. And this we not only ſay, but prove thus. If reprobation proceed upon the foreſight of ſinne, then it were of men's evill workes. Now looke upon what grounds the Apoſtle proves, that election is not of; good workes, upon the ſame ground it is evident that reprobation is not of evill works: for the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the one is this. <hi>Before Iacob &amp; Eſau were borne or had done good or evill; it was ſaid to Rebekah the elder ſhall ſerve the younger, therfore election is not of good works.</hi> In like manner thus I reaſon concerning Reprobation, <hi>Before Iacob and Eſau were borne or had done good or evill it was ſaid to Rebekah, the elder ſhall ſerve the younger, therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation is not of evill workes.</hi> 2. If God doth ordaine any man to damnation upon fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of ſin, then this ſin foreſeen is the cauſe of the Divine ordinance; but ſin foreſeen cannot be the cauſe why God ordained man to damnation; as I prove thus. If it be the cauſe then either by the neceſſity of nature; or by the ordinance of God; not by neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of nature. For undoubtedly God if it pleaſed him could ordaine to annihilate them for their ſinnes, inſtead of puniſhing them with eternall fire. Nor can it be the cauſe of any ſuch decree by the free ordinance of God. For if it were, marke what intolerable abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dityes would follow, namely this, That God did ordaine that upon the foreſight of ſinne he would ordaine men unto damnation; whereby God's eternall ordination is made the object of God's ordination; whereas all know that the Objects of God's decrees (which are all one with his ordinations) are things temporall, not things eternall. 3. If the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of ſinne goes before the decree of damnation, then the decree of permitting ſinne goes before the decree of damning for ſin; that is the permiſſion of ſinne was firſt in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and conſequently it ought to be laſt in execution; that is, Firſt man ſhould be damned for ſin, and not till afterwards permitted to ſinne. The ſecond thing charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Piſcator</hi> is this, that, <hi>Reprobates are preciſely appointed to ſin.</hi> Now here the crimination grates not upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the manner of being appointed thereunto; otherwiſe a way could be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a progreſſe <hi>in infinitum.</hi> Now why ſhould it be any more a fault in <hi>Piſcator</hi> to ſay of ſome that they are appointed to ſinne; then in <hi>Peter</hi> to ſay of ſome that they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to diſobedience: or in all the Apoſtles to profeſſe that all the outrages commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56120:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> by the Gentiles and people of Iſraell were ſuch as Gods hand &amp; his counſell had before determined to be done? or why doth <hi>Piſcator</hi> make God to be the Authour of ſinne in this, more then <hi>Peter</hi> and all the Apoſtles? And conſidering this man's unconſcionable carriage in this, let the Reader take heed how he ſuffers himſelfe to be gull'd by this Authour, and drawne to cenſure ſuch ſpeeches in <hi>Piſcator,</hi> as making God the Authour of ſinne, when hereby he is drawne ere he is aware to paſſe the like cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on the Apoſtles? And the holy Ghoſt himſelfe, whoſe expreſſions are the ſame for ſubſtance with the expreſſions of <hi>Piſcator.</hi> It is farther obſervable that <hi>Piſcator</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Reprobates by reaſon of this Divine ordination doe ſinne neceſſarily.</hi> I anſwer, <hi>Piſcator</hi> was an excellent Scripture Divine, but noe School-divine; and therefore noe marvaile if he want the accurateneſſe of Scholaſticall expreſſion. Yet I ſalve him thus. They ſinne neceſſarily <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Eph:</hi> 28.</note> upon ſuſpicion that God will have them to ſinne by his permiſſion; but this is noe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity <hi>ſimply</hi> ſo called, but only <hi>ſecundum quid.</hi> But God decrees the manner of things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to paſſe, as well as the things themſelves; as before I ſhewed out of <hi>Aquinas.</hi> Soe that all be it it muſt needs be, that ſinne come to paſſe, in caſe God hath decreed it ſhall come to paſſe; yet if the queſtion be, after what manner it ſhall come to paſſe, I anſwere, not neceſſarily, but contingently and freely, that is not onely with a poſſibility of not comming to paſſe, but with a free power in the creature to abſtaine from that ſin which is committed by him. For God ordained that every thing that doth come to paſſe ſhall come to paſſe agreably to the nature thereof, and accordingly moves every creature to worke agreeably to their natures. Neceſſary agents, neceſſarily, contingent agents contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently. Free agents freely. And as formerly was mentioned, every ſinfull act is a naturall act; and a man hath free power even in the ſtate of corruption either to doe, or to leave undone any naturall act. And <hi>Piſcator</hi> in other places dealing with <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> clearely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth as I well remember (though the the place come not to my memory) that wicked men doe commit thoſe things freely which are committed by them. And it is an excellent ſaying of <hi>Auſtine,</hi> that, <hi>Libertas ſine gratiâ non eſt libertas ſed contumacia, Liberty without grace, is not liberty but wilfullneſſe;</hi> &amp; indeed they ſhew too much will therein, rather then too little: and in denying liberty to them that want grace, he ſpeakes of liberty morall, which is only unto true good, not of liberty naturall, which hath place only in the choice of meanes, and is inſeparable from the nature of man: But true morality ſets a mans ſoule in a right condition towards his right end.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It may be this Authour could not be ſo inconſiderate as not to perceive that even thoſe expreſſions concerning Gods decree, which he criminates in our Divines are Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſſions; therefore to helpe his cauſe here he imputes unto them, that they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that God decreed this immutably; as if himſelfe could be content to grant that theſe things are decreed by God, but not immutably. And would this Authour have the will of God to be of a mutable condition, like unto ours? I am confident he dares not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ſo much; for albeit he licks his lips at a conditionall decree, yet how doth he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this to be mutable? For to reſolve to ſave men upon condition of faith, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and perſeverance; and damne others in caſe they continue in infidelity and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency; if accordingly none be ſaved but ſuch in whom faith and repentance, and finall perſeverance therein is found, none damned but ſuch as perſevere in ſinne unto death; what change is there in all this? Unleſſe this be it, that God did not reſolve to ſave any particular perſon untill his finall perſeverance was accompliſhed; And ſo God may be ſaid in proceſſe of time, to change from not willing to willing one man's ſalvation, and another man's damnation: In which caſe God's decree alſo ſhould not be eternall, but begin in time. Againe as touching that which followes of of God decreeing that <hi>Reprobates ſhall live and dye in ſinne.</hi> I anſwer, to decree not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Reprobates, is to decree that Reprobates ſhall not be regenerated, for they are not able to regenerate themſelves; and to decree that they ſhall not be regenerated, is to decree that they ſhall live and dye in ſinne, by God's permiſſion, he reſolving never to ſhew ſuch mercies to take them of from their ſinfull courſes by repentance. And ſo long as they are not borne of God, they will not heare his words, as our Saviour teſtifies ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Yee therefore heare them not, becauſe ye are not of God.</hi> As for ſinne procured by the hand of God, which he obtrudes upon our Divines; not one paſſage doth he produce for that.

of every ſober Chriſtian, whether to do that, which therein is attributed to God, be not to procure ſin. It is apparent that Joſeph acknowledgeth, that the Lord ſent him into Egypt, yet was this brought to paſſe by the parricidiall hands of his brethren. And it is no leſſe plaine that God hardened <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart that he ſhould not let Iſrael goe And by <hi>Arminius</hi> his Definition of effectuall grace, it is evident that by Gods denying it, ſin doth follow infallibly. And ſo likewiſe upon Gods permiſſion of willing this or that, he profeſſeth that it muſt needs be, that by noe kind of argument ſhall ſuch a one be perſwaded to nill it. I come to the meanes whereby he is ſaid to procure it. The firſt is, <hi>by withdrawing grace neceſſary for the avoyding of ſin.</hi> Now of this he gives no inſtance out of any of our Divines. 2 I know no grace which this Authour accounts neceſſary, that any of our Divines teach to be withdrawen by God. 3 God indeed doth not determine their wills to that which is good; but this Authour doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count any ſuch determination neceſſary to the avoyding of ſin. 4 Prohibition, denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation of judgment, dehortation and ſuch gracious actions, God doth neither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, nor withhold from the wicked, who are partakers of this grace as well as Gods children, as often as they meet in the ſame congregation for the hearing of Sermons.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. An effectuall reſtraint from ſin, I know none but the feare of God; yet this he withdrawes not from the wicked; for they never had it; nor from the children of God; only he doth not ſtirrre it in them at all times, ſo often as he ſuffers them to ſin, which yet may be to gracious ends. As I for the confirmation of their faith, that nothing, no not ſin ſhall ſeparate them from the love of God; when they ſhall find the goodneſſe of God minding them of their errours, and bringing them to repentance. 2 As alſo to make them ſmart for their former ſecurity and wantonneſſe in beholding the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable iſſue of it. 3 To provoke them to walke more carefully and circumſpectly for the time to come, ſtanding upon their guard, and keeping the watch of the Lord. 4.

I am bold to ſpeake it, It is good for a proud man to to fall into ſome open and manifeſt ſin.</hi> I come to the ſecond ſtay, whereby he objects to our Divines that they maintaine that <hi>God procures the ſinnes of men,</hi> and that <hi>is by his moving and inclining them by his irreſiſtable and ſecret workings on their hearts, to ſinfull actions.</hi> To which I anſwer firſt that not any of the paſſages alleadged by him out of Calvin (who alone makes <hi>totam paginam</hi> in this of his) makes mention of Gods <hi>irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable working;</hi> or of <hi>moving or inclining unto ſinfull actions.</hi> And let every ſober man judge whether a bridle is fit to urge men to action, and not rather to reſtraine from action, and this is the force of the firſt Quotation. But this Authour through heat cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting his imagination tooke a bridle for a ſpurre. His ſecond teſtifies only this, that man doth nothing but what God decreed, and by his direction appointeth; and this alſo upon pregnant teſtimonies of ſcripture; never undertaking to ſhew Calvins inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation to be falſe, or his accommodation of them to be incongruous. In the third he grants that God workes in the mind of men. In the 4. he ſaith that God <hi>ſtirrs up the wills, and confirmes the purpoſes of wicked men for the execution of his judgment by Satan the miniſter of his wrath.</hi> Where conſider he doth this by <hi>Satan,</hi> that is he gives them over to <hi>Satan</hi> for this; ſo that 'tis <hi>Satan</hi> that ſtirres up their wills and confirmes their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, by Gods permiſſion without reſtraint either immediate or mediate by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of his good angells; and all this is but to execute Gods judgments. And that it is juſt with God to puniſh ſin with ſin, both ſcripture teſtifies in divers places, and <hi>Auſtin</hi> confirmes with variety of Scripture teſtimonies, in his lib. 5. contra Julian: Pelag: cap. 3. The laſt is that God's worke it is to harden mans heart, and thereby prepare him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction? And let every ſober reader that is not willing to be cheated both of his faith and honeſty all at once, examine theſe places in Calvin, and the Scriptures whereby he proves that which he affirmes; and let him but aske the Authour theſe queſtions. If Calvin delivers nothing in all this but what he proves out of Scripture, why is he found fault with more then the word of God. If Scripture be mis-alleadged and mis-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by him, why do not you confute him? 2 Though Calvin in all this makes no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods inclining wicked men to ſinfull actions; yet <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth as before I have ſhewed, and that by, variety of Scripture teſtimonies. And if this be to make God the Authour of ſin, why hath he not ſo much ingenuity as to confeſſe at leaſt in the cloſe of all, that Calvin makes God the Authour of ſin, no more then <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them more then the word of God doth, and therewithall renounce the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and turne Atheiſt. 3 As the Lord hardened the heart of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

So that the Lord made the Kings heart hard; that is not to yeild to the requeſt made, both by not giving grace to reſt ſatiſfied, and by cooperating with him, to the affecting of ſecurity and his own good.

                        <p>I come to the ſum of that which he hath delivered in a whole leafe. The firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is this, that we teach, That God appointed many miſerable men from all eternity to unavoidable torments Now that God appointed many fom eternity to everlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, this Authour acknowledgeth as well as we. As for the avoidable condition of them, it is confeſſed on both ſides, that they are avoidable only by breaking off their ſinnes by repentance before their death; and by this we acknowledge them to be avoidable of all and every one, as well as they. But we ſay God doth not grant this grace to all. For he is not bound to give it to all, noe nor to any; but he vouchſafeth this grace to whom he will, and he denieth it to whom he will, and this St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught us, where he ſaith, <hi>God hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth.</hi> The ſecond is, that we teach, <hi>that God to bring about their intended ruine, decreed that they ſhould without remedie live &amp; die in a ſtate of ſin.</hi> To this I anſwer, that it is a moſt abſurd conceite, to make the tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of any man God's end. We have learnt of King <hi>Solomon</hi> that, <hi>God made all things for himſelfe;</hi> here is the end of his actions, the manifeſtation of his own glory And albeit, <hi>he made the very wicked alſo againſt the day of evill;</hi> yet the end thereof was, <hi>for himſelfe,</hi> as formerly ſpecified, that is for the manifeſtation of his juſt wrath, and that God hath power without any difference in the matter, to make ſome veſſells of wrath, and ſome of mercy, as he thinkes good. The Apoſtle plainely teacheth us, where he ſaith, <hi>Hath not the Potter power over the clay of the ſame lump to make one veſſell unto honour, and another un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">

So that this is God's end not man's damnation, but his own glory. <hi>Haec loquendiratio</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin, this manner of ſpeech, finem creationis eſſe interitum aeternum, the end of man's creation is his everlaſting deſtruction, nuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam</hi>

And as for this Authour's opinion in premiſing the foreſight of ſin to the decree of damnation, I have already repreſented the manifeſt abſurdity thereof, as namely in this, that ſeing God cannot foreſee ſin, unleſſe he firſt decree to permit it, it followes that by his opinion, the decree to permit ſin muſt preceed the decree of damnation, that is ſin is firſt in inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then damnation. Whence it followes that if ſin be firſt in intention, it muſt be laſt in execution; and conſequently men ſhall be firſt damned for their ſin, and after that ſuffered to commit ſin; this is the glorious iſſue of the premiſes of this Authour. His third and laſt is, that by our doctrine, <hi>God for the effecting of all this powerfully doth ſo governe and work upon the wills of Reprobates, that they have noe libertie or abilitie at all in the iſſue of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding their ſinnes, but muſt of neceſſitie commit them</hi> To this I anſwer, that no other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is requiſite for the effecting of all this; then 1. To ſuffer all men to fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> 2. To bring forth all men in originall ſinne, which alone deſerves damnation as Mr. <hi>Hoord</hi> confeſſeth, and as this Authour ſometimes read in his Lectures at Magdelen Hall. 3. Not to regenerate Reprobates, but to ſuffer them finally to perſevere in their
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56120:199"/>
ungodly courſes, without giving them grace to break off their ſins by repentance. 2. Yet we deny, that all power and ability is taken from Reprobates to avoid actuall ſinnes: We grant willingly, neither Elect, nor Reprobate, have any power to avoid ſinne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall, all of them being conceived and brought forth into the world in the corrupt maſſe. But as for actuall ſin, not only regenerate have power to avoid that, and that in a gracious manner; but every Reprobate hath power to avoid that in a naturall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. My reaſon is becauſe though a good worke may be an act ſupernaturall; yet a ſinfull work cannot be ſo, but every actuall ſin is an act naturall for the ground and ſubſtance of it But every naturall &amp; carnall man hath power freely, either to doe any act naturall or to abſtaine from doing it, though when they abſtaine from doing it, as from committing murther, adultery, theft, ſlaunder, or the like, they never abſtaine from it in a gracious manner: Like as any morall good worke, they have libertie to doe, but they cannot doe it in a gracious manner. This proceeds meerly from the Spirit of regeneration; which Spirit of regeneration the Lord never beſtowes upon any Reprobate.</p>

It is ordinary to impute ſin to thoſe who have not ſo great an hand in the production of it, as hath the Almighty, by the grounds of this opinion. For firſt, the Devill is called the Father of lies, and by the like reaſon of all other ſinnes. And therefore he that committeth ſinne, is ſaid to be of the Devill, and to be the child of the Devill. And ſin is called the the worke of the, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, which the Son of God appeared to looſe. And why is the Devill ſo called, but becauſe he doth egge and <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Jo:</hi> 8. 4. 4. 1 <hi>Io:</hi> 3. 8. 10. <hi>v.</hi> 8.</note> allure men by inward ſuggeſtions and outward temptations to fall into ſin? This is all he doth or can doe. But God doth much more, if he neceſſitate, and by his decree firſt; and next by his powerfull and ſecret wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the ſoules of men, determine their wills irreſiſtibly to ſinen. For to determine is infinitely more then barely to perſwade; for as much as ſin muſt needs follow the determination, but not the perſwaſion of the will. God is therefore a truer cauſe of ſin, by this doctrine then the Devill. 2. Wicked men are eſteemed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of their own offences; becauſe they plot, purpoſe, chooſe, &amp; commit them, and are immediate Agents in the acting of them. But God by this opinion doth more: for he overruleth the projects &amp; purpoſes of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, and by an uncontroulable motion proceeding from an immutable decree, carrieth all their delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, reſolutions, choices, and actions preciſely that very way; ſo as they cannot choſe but doe as they doe, whatſoever they may think to the contrary. They have indeed <hi>(potentiam in ſe liberam)</hi> a power in it ſelfe free to choſe what they refuſe, or to refuſe what they choſe, to determine themſelves this way or that way, as liketh them beſt; but they have not <hi>(Liberum uſum)</hi> a free uſe of this their power. God doth determine their will before it hath determined it ſelfe, and maketh them doe thoſe only actions, which his omnipotent will hath determined, and not which their wills out of any abſolute dominion over their own actions, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. More rightly therefore may God be called the Authour of thoſe offences. For deeds whether good or bad are owned more truly by him that overruleth them, then by the ſervile inſtruments that only execute and doe them.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Wicked counſellours and they who allure and adviſe men to ſin, are accounted by God and men to be the cauſes of thoſe ſins to which they are the perſwaders, and have been puniſhed for thoſe miſdeeds which others through their inſtigations have committed. <hi>Jezabell Ahab's</hi> wife was reputed and puniſhed as the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer of <hi>Naboth;</hi> becauſe ſhe counſelled and contrived the doing of it as we may ſee, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 23. 25. But what is counſelling to inforcing? Evill counſells may be refuſed, but an allmighty power cannot be reſiſted. God therefore that uſeth this (according to their doctrine) in the production of ſins, is much more an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of them, then he that only uſeth the other.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>After two leaves ſpent, firſt in the charge; and ſecondly in proving that God is not the Authour of ſin in a fumbling manner, and thirdly in repreſenting the doctrine of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines <note place="margin">Anſwer:</note> at pleaſure, now at length he comes to make it plainly appeare, <hi>that by juſt conſequence they make God the Authour of ſin, as he ſaith, will plainly appeare by certaine conſiderations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</hi> which in few words come but to this in generall, namely, that God doth more then the Devill, or wicked counſellours in alluring and advizing others to ſin, more then wicked perſons in acting of their own ſins. But by this diſcourſe of his, he is as farre off as ever from proving that we make God the Authour of ſin. For conſider, either by doing more he underſtands, that God doth the ſame which the Devill &amp; wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do; &amp; more: or though he does not the ſame, yet he doth that which is more then that. If his meaning be that God doth the ſame which the Devill &amp; wicked men doe, this is notoriouſly untrue, conſidering the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as tempters, &amp; advizers, and perſwaders unto ſin. For God on the contrary forbids ſin, perſwades to repentance, to obedience both by his word and by his ſpirit; and indeed the ſpirit workes not, but by the word which is called the ſword of the ſpirit; All holines of life is compriſed within the compaſſe of ten commandements; theſe were given by the Lord fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> pronounced by the ſound of a tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet; to theſe the Lord calls his people ſaying, <hi>ſtand in the waies and behold, and aske for the old way, which is the good way and walke therein &amp; ye ſhall find reſt unto your ſoules.</hi> For the tranſgreſſion of theſe the Lord expoſtulates with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Heare ô heavens and hearken ô earth, I have nouriſhed and brought up a</hi>

And to this purpoſe to repreſent his promiſes which he hath annexed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to godlineſſe, both the promiſes of this life, and the promiſes of a better life that is to come. Yea and his threats alſo both of judgments in the world to come, to the caſting both of body and ſoule into hell fire; and thereupon to exhort us to feare him above all others. And judgments of this world, as, famine, peſtilence, and the ſword of the enemie, <hi>To deliver them over into the hands of beaſtly people, ſkilfull to deſtroy; To ſend Serpents, and Cockatrices among them that will not be charmed, and that ſhall ſting them; and that without all mercy.</hi> Surely theſe are not the courſes of Satan or wicked counſellours. Therefore they doe not as God doth, neither doth God doe that which they doe and more alſo. 2. If it be ſaid that albeit the Lord doth not as the Devill doth, and wicked men doe in perſwading them to ſinne; yet he doth that which is more then this. I anſwer, that nevertheleſſe he cannot be accounted the Authour of ſinne, in caſe the doing of this alone doth conſtitute an Agent the Authour of ſinne. Now as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I have ſhewed this was the opinion of <hi>Dominicus Soto,</hi> and of the Divines of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamancha:</hi> yea and <hi>Vaſquez</hi> the Jeſuite profeſſeth, that he was ever of that opinion. Againe if to doe more then this, be to become the Authour of ſin; both this Authour and all that are of his Spirit doe maintain as well we, that God doth that which is farre more then this. For I preſume he will not deny, but that God is he, and he alone, who doth ſupport our natures in the committing of ſin; &amp; who maintaines our ſenſes in their vigour and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, without which we could take noe pleaſure in ſin, and that concurres to every act of ſin, in the way of cauſe efficient, not morally, which alone makes one to become the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of ſin, by the judgment of Divines formerly mentioned; but phyſically and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, which no creature can doe, namely become a naturall coefficient cauſe to the act of another man's will. Nay which is moſt conſiderable, I preſume this Authour hath ſo much accuratenes in School-learning, as not to deny that when the Devill tempts us, or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed counſellours doe tempt us to ſin, God concurres with them in this act, and that in the kind of a cauſe efficient phyſicall. <hi>For in him we live and move and have our being;</hi> what is <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Act:</hi> 17. 28.</note> it to have our being from him, but that he is the Authour of it in the kind of a cauſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient? In the ſame ſenſe doe we live in him, and in the ſame ſenſe doe we move in him. It ſtands us upon as much to maintaine this, as to maintaine that God is our Creatour. For unleſſe all things doe ſubſiſt in him neither were all things created by him. Now this is a great deale more then to perſwade. For a weake man is able to perſwade, but noe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is able to performe theſe parts which God doth in the act of every thing created by by him. So that hereby the Reader may evidently perceive, that the diſcourſe is as farre off as ever, from proving God by this Doctrine of ours to be the Authour of ſin, any more then he is conſtituted the Authour of ſin by the doctrine of this Interpolator. But I am content to examine the things he propoſeth particularly and ſeverely.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The Devill,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>doth only allure men by inward ſuggeſtions, and outward tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to fall into ſinne: But God doth much more if he doe neceſſitate, and by his decree firſt; and next by his powerfull and ſecret working in the ſoules of men, determine their wills irreſiſtibly to ſinne. For to determine is infinitely more then to perſwade.</hi> Now to this I have already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by ſhewing. 1. That albeit God doth more then this, yet ſeeing he doth not this: if the doing of this alone conſtitutes one the Authour of ſin, as many great Divines have concurrently maintained; ſtill God is free from being the Authour of ſin. This Authour barely ſuppoſing, not once offering to prove the contrary. 2. Himſelfe confeſſeth that God concurres to the act of every ſinne, and that in the kind of a cauſe efficient naturall. And I may be as bold as to ſay of this, that it is infinitely more then to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade; like as he ſaith of God's determining the will and neceſſitating thereof. Now I proceed to a more particular examination of his diſcourſe. And here firſt I wonder not a little at this Authour's diſtinction of the Devill's inward ſuggeſtion from his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward temptations. For I confeſſe freely I know noe outward temptation of Satan, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from his inward ſuggeſtions. Outward occaſions and provocations to ſinne I know none wrought by Satan, any farther then as he in ſome caſes is

Secondly, to neceſſitate the will or determine the will are noe phraſes of our Divines.

Surely hereby he ſhould performe a worke more worthy of a Scholaſticall Divine, then by ſo hungry a diſcourſe as this.

The ſun ſhining upon a dung-mixton, makes it evaporate, but doth not make it ſtinke. The ſun makes flowers to evaporate and ſend forth their favours as well as a dung-mixton; but that the one evaporates a ſweet odour the other an unſavory, is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nature of things themſelves on which the ſun beates. In like ſort the Sun by the heat thereof provokes all things to engender according to their kinds, even frogs and toades &amp; ſnakes, as well as other creatures profitable for the uſe of man in the way of food; yea of vipers fleſh good uſe is made in the way of phyſicke. And God knowes how to make good uſe even of the ſinnes of men. and of the rage and malice of Satan. If an underw-heele being out of his place, the upper wheele in a jacke or clocke will ſet him going in a wrong way, as well as all the reſt in a right way; his motion is from the upper whele, his irregular motion from himſelfe.

Yet this Authour carrieth it hand over head, as if to be the Authour of the action, were to be the ſinne; not conſidering that himſelfe maintaines, that God is the Authour of the action, and that in the kind of a cauſe efficient naturall. Thirdly, when <hi>Bradwardine</hi> maintaines that God neceſſitates the will to every good act thereof, he withall profeſſeth that he neceſſitates it <hi>ad liberum actum ſuum</hi> that is to worke every act thereof, freely. Soe when <hi>Alvarerz</hi> maintaines that God determinates the will to every act thereof, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all maintaines that God determines the will to worke free ye and ſo <hi>Aquinas.</hi> For when he workes upon contingent cauſes, he moves the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bring forth their effects contingently; like as when he workes upon neceſſary cauſes, he moves them to produce their effects ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily. And like as to move contingent cauſes to produce their effects contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, is to move them to produce their effects with a poſſibility to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Soe to move free cauſes, to produce their effects freely, is to move them to produce their effects with an active power to the contrary. But to proceed, whereas he ſaith, that ſinne muſt needs follow the determination; it is as true. 1.

but not at all required to the ſinne; though this Authour carieth it blindfold after this manner. Secondly, ſo ſay we is determination required to the ſubſtance of every act. And Gods concourſe with the creature is not coordinate, like as one man concurres with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in moving a timber logge, which is the expreſſion of the Jeſuites, thereby mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting the vileneſſe of their opinion, as we can demonſtrate, and that more waies then one by evident demonſtration, as I have allready ſhewed in my <hi>Vindiciae.</hi> Let this Authour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <note place="margin">

Now who is ſo blind as not to obſerve, that as often as a man ſinneth, it is the will of God, that is the decree of God he ſhall ſin, by the very groundes received by our Adverſaries. Thus much as touching my firſt anſwer concerning the neceſſary con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

My ſecond anſwer is this. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit God determines the will to any vertuous act, morally good; whether in the way of doing ſome morall good, or in the way of abſtaining from ſome motall evill; yet unleſſe God give man ſome faith and love, as fountaines out of which every morall worke muſt proceed, that it may be acceptable with God; ſuch an one ſhall neceſſarily ſinne, though not as touching the act done, yet as touching the manner of doing; for as much as without true faith and love he can neither performe any morall good worke, nor abſtaine from any morall evill worke in a gracious manner. Now let every ſober man judge, whether God be bound to give every man faith and love, without which all is one as touching the preſerving a man from ſinne in generall, whether the will of man be determined by God, to an act morally good, or morally evill. In each of which God determines the will only to the ſubſtance of the act: So that whether God cooperates to the ſubſtance of the act or noe, and whether this cooperation be by way of determining the will or noe; ſtill there
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56120:202" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will be a neceſſary conſequence of ſinne to every act of man, if God doth not beſtow the ſpirit of regeneration upon him, which ſpirit of God we know was given to our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; though not under this notion of the Spirit of regeneration, and whereof they were juſtly bereaved upon the firſt ſinne committed by them; And becauſe all we have been derived from them ſince their fall, therefore we have received our natures from them deprived of the Spirit of God, and therein continue untill ſuch time as it pleaſeth God for Chriſt ſake, to reſtore it unto us, which he doth in regenerating us. Thirdly, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the very permiſſion of ſin, it followes neceſſarily that ſin ſhall be, by the doctrine not of <hi>Piſcator</hi> only, but of <hi>Vorſtius</hi> and <hi>Arminius</hi> alſo; yea and of the learned amongſt the Papiſts, as <hi>Navarettus</hi> and <hi>Penottus:</hi> And the very definition of Permiſſion of ſinne by <hi>Arminians</hi> juſtifies it; as alſo the Jeſuites doctrine concerning <hi>gratia congruâ.</hi> For if God will not afford that grace, upon the grant whereof men will abſtaine from ſin, as God well knowes; but ſuch a grace, upon the grant whereof man will abſtaine from ſin, which alſo is well known unto God; doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the next place he tells us that wicked men are eſteemed Authours of their offences: Now by the way this is not ſo; To be a ſinner is one thing to be an Authour of ſinne is another thing. And to be an Authour of ſinne is in reference rather to anothers ſinne, then to ones owne. And <hi>Martinius</hi> tells me that, <hi>Authour eſt cujus autoritate &amp; ſententiâ aliquid fit, cujus teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio ut aliquid credamus, adducimur. Qui hortatur ut fiat.

But God by this opinion doth more; for he overuleth the projects and purpoſes of wicked men, and by an uncontroulable motion, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from an immutable decree, carrieth all their deliberations, reſolutions, choices, and actions preciſely that very way, ſo as they cannot chooſe but do, as they doe, whatſoever they may thinke to the contrary.</hi> To which I anſwer, that it becomes every man to give the Divell his right, &amp; and not make him worſe then he is, nor wicked men neither. Now noe wicked man doth will or chooſe ſinne as ſinne <hi>Nemo vult eſſe incontinens,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> although they doe ſuch things as doe ſufficiently evidence their incontinent diſpoſition. For the object of the will is only good; neither can any thing be willed by man, but, <hi>ſub ratione boni, under the ſhew of good:</hi> whether this good be in the kind of profit, or in the kind of pleaſure, or in the kind of honeſty. So <hi>Lucretia</hi> when ſhe killed her ſelfe, ſhe did it for the preſervation of the integrity of her mind in the opinion of the world, and that they might know that ſhe conſented not unto <hi>Tarquinius;</hi> but was forced by him. So then the act is it they doe or chooſe to doe for ſome motive or other, which whether it be pleaſure or profit, or credit they get thereby, that makes not the act ſinfull, but only that it is againſt ſome law or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, forbidding it And this act, (all ſides confeſſe) is the worke of God, as well as the worke of man; as <hi>in whom</hi> we move, like as <hi>in him we live, and have our being.</hi> And <hi>Bradwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> maintaines that of every act of the creature God is a more immediate cauſe then the <note place="margin">

God overruleth no man's good projects or purpoſes, otherwiſe then as when accepting their intentions he will not have them put ſuch in execution becauſe perhaps he hath reſerved that for another time &amp; perſon. As when <hi>David</hi> was purpoſed to build God an houſe, &amp; was encouraged therein by <hi>Nathan:</hi> yet the Lord ſent <hi>Nathan</hi> ſhortly unto <hi>David</hi> to give him to underſtand, that he reſerved that work for <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son; yet ſo well accepting <hi>David's</hi> purpoſe that he promiſed to build his houſe. But if God at any time overruleth the wicked projects and purpoſes of men, whether good or evill, let us bleſſe him rather for this then curſe him; by curſing them that maintaine this good providence. Yet in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verruling them, whether he doth it immediately, or by the miniſtry of his good Angells; not by working immediately upon the will, as this Authour dreameth. For that is not the way to worke agreably to the reaſonable nature of man (though ſo he worke alſo by generall influence affoarded co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all agents) but by repreſenting to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding congruous motives to divert them from that they doe intend; whether in a gracious

manner, as he diverted <hi>David</hi> from his purpoſe to maſſacre the whole houſe of <hi>Nabal;</hi> or only in a naturall way, whereby he diverts wicked men from their ungodly deſignes, by repreſenting the danger thereof, to make them feare, &amp; ſo to reſtraine them. Will the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill himſelfe be over prone to blaſpheme God for this? yet in this alone he doth more then either the Devill or man can doe; though this be not all that he doth. For he doth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate to every deſigne and execution of the creature, be it never ſo abominable; which neither man, nor Angells can doe. And he hath power to give over unto Satan, and to harden any man, and that more effectully then any Devill can doe. The Devill could not ſay with truth that <hi>He</hi> would <hi>harden Pharaoh's heart,</hi> that he ſhould not let Iſrael goe. Nor when he had let them goe, <hi>I will harden Pharaoh's heart that he ſhall follow after them,</hi> to bring them back. The Devill could not ſay in truth, as the Lord did to <hi>David, I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them to thy neighbour, and he ſhall lye with thy wives in the ſight of the ſunne.</hi> Nor as he ſaid to <hi>Ieroboam, Behold I will rent the kingdome out of the hands of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee.</hi> Nay the very permiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſin ſo as whereby it ſhall infallibly come to paſſe, is not in the power of any creature, but in God alone. And ſhall it follow, that becauſe God doth more, both as touching the act it ſelfe, and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſinfull condition of it, then any creature can doe, therefore God is the Authour of ſinne? whereas when God moves a man or carrieth him on to any good morall workes, whether in doing that which is vertuous, or abſtaining from that which is vitious, this man ſhall certainely ſinne, though not in ſo great a degree, unleſſe God be pleaſed over and above to regenerate him, and to beſtow faith, and love on him, for as much as in this caſe, though he doe an act vertuous, yet ſhall he not doe it in a gracious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner. &amp; though he doe abſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an act vitious yet he ſhall not abſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it in a gracious manner. Let this man therefore proceed, &amp; maintaine (if he thinks good) that except God doth beſtow the ſpirit of regeneration upon all and every one throughout the world, he is the Authour of ſinne, not only when he moves them to ſuch acts which are evill, but alſo when he moves them to the doing of ſuch as are vertuous, or to the abſtaining from thoſe that are vitious. As for his phraſes noe wiſe man will regard them, but only ſuch as are content to feed on huskes for want of better food. As, when he talkes of <hi>motion uncontroulable,</hi> which makes a noiſe, as if men's wills would controule his motion, but cannot: whereas God as the firſt mover moves the creature moſt congruouſly unto his nature; without which motion of his the creature could not move at all. The like noyſes makes the phraſe <hi>immutable decree;</hi> as empty things many times give the greateſt ſound: whereas by vertue of God's immutable decree it is, that it cannot otherwiſe be; then that as neceſſary things cannot but come to paſſe neceſſarily; ſo contingent things cannot but come to paſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingently, and the free actions of men freely. But by the way he manifeſt's how he licks his lips, at a <hi>Mutable decree of God,</hi> even of that God with whom, as St. <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>there is no variableneſſe, nor ſhadow of change.</hi> He doth acknowledge, we maintaine, <hi>poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam in ſe liberam;</hi> but then he ſaith, we doe not maintaine, <hi>liberum uſum;</hi> a moſt abſurd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction. For noe power deſerves to be ſtiled free, ſave that it is of free uſe and exerciſe. And what a prodigious thing is it to affirme, that it is not within the almighty power of God to cauſe that this or that ſhall be done by a reaſonable creature freely: this is it that <hi>Bradwardine</hi> propoſeth to the judgment of all to conſider, whether it be not an unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing to deny this unto God. <hi>God doth determine their will before it hath determined it ſelfe, and maketh them doe thoſe only actions, which his omnipotent will hath determined, and not which their wills out of any abſolute dominion over their own actions, have preſcribed.</hi> Thus he relates the opinion of our Divines; whereas neither determining, nor neceſſitating (as I ſaid before) are the expreſſions of our Divines, but of Papiſts; yet he laies not this to the charge of Papiſt's: Noe nor to the charge of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> for ſaying that God doth not only rule, and governe, but wreſt and bend them, and that to one evill rather then to an other. If Scholars of our Univerſities uſe any ſuch phraſes, it is no other then they find in uſe among School-divines. It is true indeed Jeſuites oppoſe the <hi>Dominicans</hi> in this. This Authour ſides with the Jeſuites, but why doth he not take to taske any one chapter in <hi>Alvarez</hi> on this point to anſwer, to overthrow their grounds, which are no other then the very word of God, and cleare reaſon doth juſtifie. And the ground of the Jeſuites in oppoſing, is meerely an invention of their own, concerning a certaine knowledge of God called <hi>a middle knowledge;</hi> a vile invention, and a palpable untruth, and controulable of manifeſt contradiction. For they ſuppoſe a thing knowable by God, as future, before God's will hath paſſed upon it to make it future, being in it's own nature meerly poſſible; and conſequently cannot paſſe out of the condition of a thing meerly poſſible, into the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56120:203" rendition="simple:additions"/>
condition of a thing future without a cauſe. Now noe cauſe can be deviſed hereof with any colour of reaſon, but the will of God. For firſt, the cauſe hereof muſt be eternall, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thing it ſelfe, of the cauſe whereof we diſpute, is eternall to wit, the fruition of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing. This I ſay was eternall, for it is known with God from all eternity. Now there is noe eternall cauſe to be found, but in God alone, therefore the cauſe why things meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſible in their own nature, became future, and that from everlaſting, muſt be found in God alone. Therefore it muſt either be the will of God; or the knowledge of God that did make it future; and ſeing the knowledge of God rather ſuppoſeth them to be future, then makes them ſo; what remaines but that the will of God muſt neceſſarily be the cauſe hereof? Nay conſider whether the Jeſuites themſelves doe not manifeſt more ingenuity by farre, then this boiſterous <hi>Theologue,</hi> that thinks to carry all with the blaſt of his words, the reſolution of whoſe arguments generally, neither having the word of God for their ground; nor any confeſt principle of reaſon. Whereas not the greateſt, Angell of God will take upon him ſuch an authoritative manner of diſcourſe. For did we grant, that <hi>God by his Allmighty will did impoſe any neceſſity upon our wills.</hi> Yet <hi>Suarez</hi> confeſſeth that <note place="margin">

Againe the wills determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it ſelfe, is no other then the wills operation; and this Authour that oppoſeth us dares not deny the wills opperation to be the worke of God. But what School divine can he produce that delivers himſelfe in ſo abſurd a manner; as to ſay that God firſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the will, and that afterwards the will determines it ſelfe; eſpecially ſpeaking of ſuch actions of the will as are produced by the power of nature? The wills determination of it ſelfe, we ſay, is the worke of God moving the creature agreably to the nature thereof; that is to be carried neceſſarily to that which is it's end, and appeares to be good <hi>in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re convenientis:</hi> and freely to the meanes, which appeare to be good, <hi>in genere conducentis,</hi> as fit to pronounce the end intended. All confeſſing <hi>(Durand</hi> excepted) that God works the act; the queſtion whether he works the act abſolutely, the will a ſecond agent ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate unto God, as to it's Creatour? Or conditionally, <hi>modo vellimus,</hi> provided that we will it, God the firſt agent ſubordinate to the will of the creature? This Authour will have it to be wrought by God, that is conditionally, in dependence upon, and expectation of the operation of the creature, which we ſay is moſt abſurd Firſt becauſe thus the firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent is made ſubordinate to the ſecond agent, which is moſt unaturall. Secondly, obſerve a manifeſt contradiction. For the queſtion is about, <hi>actus volendi, the act of willing,</hi> in man. Now if God produce this act upon ſuppoſition, that man produceth this act, then the ſame act is produced by God upon ſuppoſition, that it is produced by man. If it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by man, what need is there of God's producing it by way of ſupplement? Thirdly, by this meanes the thing is made the condition of it ſelfe. For hereby it is ſaid, this act is made upon condition that it doth exiſt; &amp; ſo the ſelfe ſame thing ſhall be before &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelfe. 4. Thus man's production of the act ſhall be noe worke of God, which holds off faith and repentance, as well as of any naturall act, in this Authours opinion. Fiftly, It is not poſſible the will can produce the act unleſſe God produceth it, If then God doth not produce it unleſſe the will doth produce it, in this caſe there ſhall be noe act produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. For if I goe not to London unleſſe you goe with me; nor you goe to London unleſſe I goe with you; here is no going at all till one ſaith I ſay I goe, and his reſolution carrieth the other with him if the others depend thereupon. 6 Whereas to helpe at a dead lift the Jeſuiticall doctrine of, <hi>Scientia media, middle knowledge,</hi> is called in after this manner; God foreſeing that at ſuch an inſtant the will of man will produce ſuch an act, if God be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to concurre; and upon this foreknowled<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e God reſolves to concurre This doctrine I have already confounded by ſhewing the apparent falſity of this ſuppoſition. For ſeeing the wills producing ſuch an act at ſuch an inſtant, is a thing merly poſſible in it's own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; no more future then not future; It is impoſſible that this ſhould paſſe out of the condition of a thing meerly poſſible into the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a thing future without a cauſe: And noe cauſe hereof can be but the will of God, as I have often proved. It followes that the wills producing ſuch an act, depends rather upon the will of God to have it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, then on the contrary, that Gods producing ſuch an act, dependes upon the creatur's will to produce it. As for that which followes of the abſolute dominion that the will of the creature ſhould have over it's action (I preſume he meanes independent) it ſounds
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56120:203"/>
more like the voice of the Devill, then of a ſober Chriſtian. Yet it is more then I know that Lucifer himſelfe challengeth any ſuch abſolute Dominion over his actions unto himſelfe; If he doth, I know noe greater ſinne that hee or the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be guilty of; unleſſe in caſe groſſe ignorance doth excuſe it. To deny God to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the firſt Agent is to deny his God-head; and if hee be, <hi>primum agens,</hi> hee muſt be <hi>primum liberum</hi> too, the firſt free agent. And to make our ſelves to be <hi>prima libera, the firſt free agents,</hi> what is other then to advance our ſelves into the very Throne of God's Soveraigntie; and doe wee not feare leaſt his wrath ſmoake us thence. And if all this that hee contends for were granted him, that nothing but mere neceſſitie were found in the motion of men's wills; yet <hi>Suarez</hi> will juſtifie us from ſpeaking contradiction, or delivering ought that exceeds the compaſſe of God's omnipotencie. And what if all the world were innocent, yet God ſhould not be unjuſt in caſting the moſt innocent creature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell fire; as <hi>Medina</hi> profeſſeth, and that by the unanimous conſent of Divines, and <hi>Vaſquez</hi> the Jeſuite acknowledgeth this to be in the power of God as he is Lord of life and death, and in the laſt chapter of the booke, <hi>de praedeſtinatione &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ</hi> which goes under <hi>Auſtin's</hi> name, there is an expreſſe paſſage to juſtifie it. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that worke be not <hi>Auſtin's,</hi> yet it is lately juſtified to be the worke of a great fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s, and as Orthodoxe as he; namely, the worke of <hi>Fulgentius</hi> as <hi>Raynaudus</hi> the Jeſuite hath lately proved, and juſtified that paſſage alſo; together with that which is uſually brought by School-Divines to prove it out of the twelfth <note place="margin">Raynaud: in in Vindcatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.</note> chapter of <hi>Wiſedome,</hi> and ſhewes the right reading, as followed by <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Gregory.</hi> And withall repreſents a pregnant paſſage taken out of the fifteenth Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Macarius</hi> to the ſame purpoſe. And out of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his 2. <hi>De compunctione cordis, about the end thereof.</hi> And out of <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon <hi>Pſalme</hi> the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth, about the beginning. And to theſe he addeth <hi>Ariminenſis, Cameracenſis, Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and <hi>Lorinus,</hi> all maintaining the ſame. And this is evident by conſideration of the power, which it pleaſed the Lord to execute upon his holy Son, and our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, and by the power which he gives us over brute creatures. This I ſay, if all that he contends for were granted, ſhould rather be concluded therehence, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that in this caſe the creature ſhould be innocent, then that God ſhould be the Authour of ſinne; eſpecially conſidering that God performes in all this noe other thing then belongs unto him of neceſſitie; as without which his moving of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes, it were impoſſible the creature ſhould worke at all, which we have made good, by ſhewing the manifeſt abſurdity of their contrary doctrine, who maintaine a bare concourſe Divine either in ſubordination unto the agency of the creature, or without ſubordinating the operation of the creature, to motion Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. But we doe ſubordinate it, as without which the ſecond cauſe could not worke at all, and by vertue whereof it doth worke, and that freely, ſo farre forth as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of will is competent to a creature; but not ſo as to make the creature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere with his Creatour. Let man be a ſecond free Agent, but ſet our God that made us evermore be the firſt free Agent; leaſt otherwiſe we ſhall deny him the ſame power over his creatures, <hi>that the Potter hath over the clay of the ſame lumpe to make one veſſell unto honour and another unto diſhonour.</hi> This power in my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, the Lord hath given me eyes to diſcerne as taught us in his holy word, and an heart to ſubmit unto it; and to his providence in governing my will, even in the worſt actions that ever were committed by me, without any repining humour againſt his hand; though I thinke it lawfull for us in an holy manner to expoſtulate with God ſometimes in the Prophets language and ſay, <hi>Lord why haſt thou cauſed us to erre from thy waies and hardened our hearts againſt thy feare?</hi> Which yet I confeſſe he brings to paſſe at noe time, <hi>infundendo malitiam, by infuſing any malice into me,</hi> who naturally have more then enough of that leaven in me; but, <hi>non infundendo gratiam,</hi> not quickning in me that holy feare, which he hath planted in me, of which grace I confeſſe willingly, I have a great deale leſſe then I deſire, though the leaſt meaſure of it is a great deale more then I doe or can deſerve. Neither ſhall I ever learne of this Authour after his manner to blaſpheme God if at any time hee ſhall harden my heart againſt his feare. Though this Authour ſpeakes commonly with a full and foule mouth, yet his arguments are lanke and leane; and of noe ſubſtance but words. As

Wee ſay noe ſuch thing but that God moves every creature to worke agreably to it's nature, neceſſary things neceſſarily, contingent things contingently, free Agents freely; though nothing comes to paſſe by the free agency of any creature, but what God from all eternity, by his unchangable counſell hath determined to come to paſſe. As the eleventh Article of Ireland doth profeſſe by the unanimous conſent of the ArchBiſhop, Biſhops and Clergy of that Kingdome, when thoſe Articles were made. So I ſpeake warily and circumſpectly, the rather becauſe one Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour <hi>Heylin</hi> doth in a booke intituled, <hi>The Hiſtory of the Sabbath, profeſſe,</hi> Chapter 8. page 259. <hi>That, that whole booke of Articles is now called in, and in the place thereof, the Articles of the Church of Ireland confirmed by Parliament in that Kingdome. Anno</hi> 1631. A thing I willingly confeſſe at firſt ſight ſeemed incredible unto mee; namely, that Articles of Religion agreed upon in the dayes, of King <hi>Iames,</hi> ſhould be revoked in the dayes of King <hi>Charles;</hi> but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to heare the truth of that relation. For the Authour thereof hath never as yet deſerved ſo much credit at my hands, as to be believed in ſuch a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar as this. But to returne, this Authours text is nothing anſwerable to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. For firſt, <hi>imperare</hi> to command, is one thing, and to over-rule is another thing: though he that doth, <hi>imperare</hi> command ought, is commonly accounted the Authour thereof, as a cauſe Morall, from whom comes the beginning of ſuch a worke. But utterly deny that God commands evill, and the truth is wee acknowledge noe other notion of evill then ſuch as the Apoſtle expreſſeth in calling it <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> an incongruitie to the law of God, which law commands ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things and forbids other things. I come to his third reaſon. 3. I grant wicked counſellours and perſwaders are deſervedly accounted the Authors of ſinne: The common uſe and acception of the words as I ſhewed in anſwer to the firſt, is obſerved to denote ſuch. Therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> makes Authour and diſſwader oppoſite; and by law they are puniſhable in the ſame degree with the Actors. But God is noe counſellour or perſwader to any lewd courſe, but forbids it, and diſſwades it, and that with denuntiation of the greateſt judgments among trangreſſours. 2. I willingly confeſſe that councelling is farre inferiour to enforcing; yet in Scripture phraſe earneſt intreaty, or command is oftentimes expreſt by compelling as <hi>Mat,</hi> 14. 22. <hi>Mark:</hi> 6. 45. <hi>Luk:</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Gala:</hi> 6. 12, and 2. 14. 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 28. 23. 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 21. 11. And noe marvaile for hereby many times men are drawen full ſore againſt their wills to doe that which they would not. It is true God's power cannot be reſiſted, but neither hath any man any will to reſiſt that motion of God whereby he workes agreable to their natures, then indeed there were place for reſiſting. If the Lord carrieth on a covetous perſon, ſuch as <hi>Achan</hi> to covet a wedge of gold and a Babyloniſh garment, and coveting it move him accordingly to take it, and convey it away ſecretly, and hide it in his tent, what reſiſtance doth he make in all this? Or what is done in all this leſſe agreably to his covetous diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, then to the diſpoſition of Toades and Addars, when he moves them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their nature to ſting and poyſon?

And without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſire to charme, I have ſhewed plainly, that God doth not permit any man to ſinne, and finally to perſevere in ſin to the end that he may damnethem: But that he both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them finally in ſin, and damnes them for their ſinne, for the declaration of his wrath and power on them; and alſo that he may declare the riches of his glory, upon the veſſells of his mercy, whom he hath prepared unto glory: If he put a difference between <hi>permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinne,</hi> and <hi>a will that they ſhall ſinne;</hi> I would entreate him not to ſtumble at this.

For to decree is fitter to denote ſuch things as God hath purpoſed to doe, then ſuch things as he hath purpoſed not to cure.</hi> And indeed the Ancients in this ſenſe take the word <hi>predeſtination,</hi> to be only of ſuch things as God himſelfe purpoſed to worke; as Grace and Glory, and the damnation of impenitent ſinners. But if God decrees not to cure impenitency and infidelity in ſome; judge whether upon this ground. it may not well be ſaid, that God decrees that the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency and infidelitie of ſome ſhall continue uncured And Mr. <hi>Monlin</hi> confeſſeth that God decreed that the Jewes ſhould put Chriſt to death. His words are theſe, <hi>Deus vetuit homicidium, idem tamen decrevitut Iudaei Chriſtum morte afficerent. God forbad murther yet</hi>

                           <hi>he decreed that the Iewes ſhould kill Chriſt.</hi> Yet by the way conſider, God hath no need of the ſinne of man, that he may put him to death juſtly. For undoubtedly God could anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate any creature that he hath made, the moſt holy Angells without any blemiſh to his juſtice. Yea by power abſolute he could caſt the moſt innocent creature into hell fire, and continue yet juſt ſtill, as formerly hath been ſhewed, and <hi>Raynaudus</hi> juſtifies, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents variety of teſtimonies for this, not only of School-divines, one of whom profeſſeth that it is <hi>concors omnium Theologorum ſententia, the common opinion of Divines;</hi> but of the Ancient Fathers alſo.

Biſhop of that Church explaining the Churches opinion in that point of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and predeſtination in ſeven ſeverall rules; in the fift of thoſe rules, he hath theſe words to the ſame purpoſe. God, ſaith he by his preſcience and predeſtination, hath laid a neceſſitie of being wicked upon noe man. For if he had done this, he had been the Authour of ſinnes. And thus in my iudgment doth it plainly appeare that by abſolute Reprobation, as it is taught the upper way, God is made to be the true cauſe of men's ſinnes.</p>

The Remonſtrants in their <hi>Cenſura cenſurae,</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe termes deny that Chriſt merited faith and regeneration for us; and judge by this indifferently, whether they make faith and regeneration to be the guift of God.

                           <hi>gratiae eſt fidelium. To be capable of faith and charity, is the nature of man, but to have faith and to have charity is the grace of the faithfull.</hi> Conſider in reaſon; ſupernaturall grace is not in reaſon to be accounted inferiour to a morall vertue; but ſo it will prove, if it be but a power to be good if we will. For morall vertue doth not give a man a power only to doe good if he will, but it inclines and diſpoſeth the will unto vertuous actions. So juſtice is not an indifferency of condition leaving it to man whether he will be juſt or noe; but it makes him juſt, and ſo diſpoſoth him to juſt courſes. Againe if grace ſupernaturall doth only give power to believe if one will; this being a free power, it is indifferent as well not to believe, as to beleive; as well not to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as to repent. For liberty is alwaies to act op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite; whence it will follow that by vertue of ſupernaturall grace a man is diſpoſed not more to faith, then to infidelitie, not more to repentance then to hardneſſe of heart and Impenitency. 4. Conſider, a man hath noe need of ſupernaturall grace to inable him to refuſe to repent, ſeing naturally he is ſufficiently diſpoſed hereunto; &amp; neceſſarily by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that naturall corruption which is hereditary unto him. By all this it is apparent, that a power to believe wrought in a man by ſupernaturall grace, is not a free power work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freely; but rather a neceſſary power working neceſſarily; like unto the condition of a morall vertue, which reſtraines man's naturall indifferency to good or evill, and diſpoſeth him only to good. And conſequently as many as maintaine no other power to be given unto man by grace, then to believe, if a man will; they deale like <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who called that which was meerly naturall, prevenient grace. Laſtly if God be the Authour of man's converſion, becauſe he gives him power to convert, if he will; he may as well be called the Authour of non converſion, and perſeverance in ſinne, becauſe God gives power not to convert, and to perſevere in ſinne, if he will. 2. As touching the ſecond, If God be the Authour of man's converſion, becauſe he perſwades thereunto, then certainly he is not the Authour of ſinne, becauſe he perſwades not thereunto. 3. If God be the Authour of converſion, becauſe he cooperates thereunto, then certainly he may be as well ſaid to be the Authour of every ſinfull act. For that he doth cooperate thereunto, I am very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent this Authour will not deny. Now I could earneſtly entreate the Judicious Reader to examine well this Authour's opinion in theſe particulars, and compare them with his former diſcourſe, that he may have a cleare way opened unto him to judge with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience he carried himſelfe in his former diſcourſe, imputing unto us that we make God the Authour of ſin; albeit in treating of God's providence in evill, we generally have the expreſſe word of God before our eyes; and in our explication thereof doe rather qualify the ſeeming harſhneſſe thereof, then aggravate it. For undoubtedly by the tenour of his diſcourſe, looke upon what grounds he denies God to be the Authour of ſinne, he muſt withall deny God to be the Authour of faith, of repentance, of converſion; And look upon what grounds he makes God the Authour of converſion; upon the ſame grounds he muſt make God the Authour of ſinne: As in caſe to give power to believe, if we will; and to cooperate with us in the act of faith, be to make him the Authour: Or if only upon perſwading us to believe, God is ſaid to be the Authour of faith; then it followes as a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Apologie for us, that we make not God to be the Authour of ſinne; ſeing none of us conceive him to be a perſwader of any ſinfull act; but rather a diſſwader and forbidder thereof and that upon paine of eternall damnation. But on the contrary we make a vaſt difference between God's operations in ſinfull actions, and God's operations in actions gracious. As firſt, every ſinfull act is alwaies within the compaſſe of acts naturall; noe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56120:206"/>
act is or can be a ſinne. Now to the producing of any act of morality, every man notwithſtanding his corruption hath in him a naturall power. But there is noe naturall power in man to the performing of an act ſupernaturall.

As for all other good acts, in the producing of them, God hath a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble influence; one common as they are acts naturall, touching the ſubſtance of them; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeciall as touching the gracious nature of them, proceeding from faith and love. But as touching evill acts, he hath noe influence in the producing of them, but that which is common, and to the ſubſtance of the acts; none at all as touching the evilneſſe of them, the reaſon whereof is that which was delivered by <hi>Auſtin</hi> long agoe. <hi>Malu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non habet cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam efficientem ſed deficientem, Evill hath no cauſe efficient, but deficient only.</hi> And it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that God ſhould be defective in a culpable manner. The creature may, the Creatour cannot: And the ground of the creatures defective condition is accounted to be this, that he was brought out of nothing, &amp; conſequently of a fraile condition. And it is received ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall as a rule in Schooles, that a creature cannot be made, <hi>impeccabilis per naturam,</hi> that is ſuch a one, as by nature cannot ſinne. This was delivered long agoe by <hi>Anſelme</hi> one of the firſt of School-divines; <hi>In evill things God doth worke, quod ſunt, that they are; non quod mala ſunt, not that they are evill; But in good things God doth worke, Et quod ſunt, &amp; quod bona ſunt, both that they are and that they are good.</hi> Here this Authour ſets down our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning Election and Reprobation at his pleaſure. We ſay with <hi>Auſtin</hi> that, <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination is the preparation of grace,</hi> that is the Divine decree of conferring grace; And both he and all confeſſe, it is alſo the decree of conferring glory. And becauſe in making of this decree, God had reſpect unto ſome only, not to all, both men and Angells, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this conſideration it is called the decree of Election, in diſtinction from the decree of reprobation. Now this grace is of a double nature; for either it is grace cuſtodient from ſinne, and the decree of granting this was the election of Angells, called in holy Scripture, <hi>The elect Angells;</hi> or grace healing, after men have ſinned, and the decreee of granting this is the election of men, commonly in Scripture called <hi>God's Elect,</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto this. It is farther to be obſerved that <hi>Auſtin</hi> grounds the Orthodoxe doctrine of predeſtination and election upon the Orthodoxe doctrine concerning grace. And the abſoluteneſſe of the one he built upon the freenes of the other, in not being given accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto men's merits. As it appeares, <hi>de bono perſeverantiae cap.</hi> 15. Where having propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome exceptions of the <hi>Maſſilienſes</hi> made againſt his doctrine of predeſtination, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to make anſwer thereunto, he begins thus, <hi>Iſta cum dicuntur,</hi> ſaith he. <hi>ita nos à confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenda Dei gratia, id eſt, quae non ſecundum merita noſtra datur, &amp; a confitenda ſecundum eam predeſtinatione ſanctorum deterrere non debent When theſe things are objected, they muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre us from confeſſing God's grace, I meane ſuch a grace as is not given accordiog unto works; nor from confeſſing the predeſtination of Saints according thereunto.</hi> Now if the abſoluteneſſe of predeſtination be grounded upon this, that, <hi>grace is not given according unto merits,</hi> (the ſcripture phraſe denies it to be given according unto workes. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that in this Argument, <hi>merits and workes</hi> are taken by the Ancients in one and the <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Tit:</hi> 3. 5.</note> ſame ſenſe.) it followeth that as many as deny the abſoluteneſſe of predeſtination muſt therewithall maintaine, that, <hi>Grace is given according to men's merits or works.</hi> And the reaſon is evident: For if God doth not give grace according unto men's works, but of his mere pleaſure decreed to give grace unto ſome, and not upon conſideration of their works. And this is to elect abſolutely, and <hi>antecedently without the foreſight of any deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> yea of any works; though by that expreſſion which this Authour uſeth he doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficienty manifeſt, that his opinion is, that God elects not only upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the foreſight of men's, workes but upon the foreſight of men's deſervings. It is farther conſiderable to prevent the reaches of ſuch crafty foxes as we have to deale with, whoſe courſe is in joyning the decree of converſion and ſalvation together, to tranſlate that which belongs unto one, unto the other moſt unreaſonably: For albeit God proceeds according to the mere plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and without all reſpect to workes, in conferring grace, and decreeth accordingly to conferre it: Yet he proceeds not merely according unto pleaſure, and without all reſpect of works in conferring glory; but according unto a Covenant which is this, <hi>whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiveth</hi>
                           <pb n="86" facs="tcp:56120:207"/>
                           <hi>ſhall be ſaved,</hi> and accordingly he beſtowes the kingdome of heaven by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for faith, repentance, and good workes. This hath Chriſt deſerved at the hands of <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Mat:</hi> 25.</note> his Father that our weake performances ſhould be thus rewarded. Laſtly, it is farther to be conſidered that God, as he thus beſtoweth ſalvation by way of reward of our faith, repentance  ſo from everlaſting he did decree to beſtowe ſalvation, namely, by way of reward. Not that either faith, or repentance, or good workes, any or all of theſe were the cauſe (leaſt of all the deſerving cauſe) of God's decree, or antecedaneous to his decree; but of his mere pleaſure decreed both to give the grace of faith and repentance, and to beſtow eternall life by way of a reward thereof, as may farther be proved and that clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divers waies. 1. By the Apoſtl's diſcourſe; where he diſcourſeth after this manner, <hi>Before Eſau and Iacob were borne, or had done good or evill, it was ſaid that the Elder ſhall</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom:</hi> 9. 11.</note> 
                           <hi>ſerve the younger; therefore election is not of workes:</hi> But if election did proceeed upon the foreſight of faith, repentance, and good workes, or any of them, then it might juſtly be ſaid, that it were of faith, repentance, or good workes or of all of them; And the force of the Apoſtles argument extends to conclude, that election is noe more of faith or of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, then of workes; not only becauſe faith and repentance are workes, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted in Scripture phraſe, as it appeares. <hi>Io:</hi> 6. 29. But cheifely becauſe before men are borne, they are uncapable of faith and repentance, as of good workes. 2. If faith were a motive cauſe unto election, then either it were ſo of it's own nature, or by conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution Divine: not of it's own nature as it is apparent. If by conſtitution divine, mark what ſtrange abſurdities follow; namely this, that God did ordaine, that upon the fore ſight of faith, he would ordaine men unto ſalvation, whereby God's eternall ordination is made the object of his ordination, whereas the Objects of God's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees are alwaies things temporall, never any thing that is eternall. 3. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid that God giveth ſalvation to the end he may give them faith, but it may farre more congruouſly be ſaid, that God gives faith to the end that he may ſave them; therefore the intention of ſalvation is rather before the intention of giving faith, then the intention of giving faith is before the intention of giving ſalvation. Or better thus, if God foreſee faith before he decrees ſalvation, then the intention of giving faith (without which God cannot foreſee faith) is before the intention of giving ſalvation; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the giving of faith ſhould be the laſt in execution; that is men ſhall firſt be ſaved, and aferwards have faith beſtowed upon them, to wit, in another world where they live by ſight and not by faith. I come to the decree of reprobation; the Objects whereof are two, proportionable to the two objects of election or predeſtination. The firſt is <hi>permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin,</hi> the ſecond is, <hi>Damnation for ſinne,</hi> according to that of <hi>Aquinas, Reprobatio inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit voluntatem permitendi culpam &amp; damnationem inferendi pro culpâ. Reprobation includes a will to permit ſinne, and to inflict damnation for ſinne.</hi> The firſt object of reprobation I ſay is, <hi>permiſſion of ſinne;</hi> not <hi>Sin</hi> as this Authour would have it, but permiſſion of ſinne: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe decrees, to wit, of permitting ſinne, and inferring damnation for ſinne, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of meanes conducing to a certaine end. For like as in election God decreeth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe faith, repentance, and obedience on ſome, and to reward it with everlaſting life for the manifeſtation of his glory in the way of mercy mixt with juſtice: So in Reprobation he decrees to permit others to ſinne, and finally to perſevere therein, and to damne them for their ſinne to manifeſt his glory in the way of vindicative juſtice. Now whoſoever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends an end muſt alſo be the Auhour of the meanes conducing to that end. Now God, though well he may be the Authour of permiſſion of ſinne, yet he cannot be the Author of ſinne: Albeit upon God's permiſſion of ſinne it followeth that ſinne ſhall exiſt. Now to permit ſinne is all one with denying grace, whether it be grace Cuſtodient to preſerve from it, or grace healing to pardon and cure it after it is committed. Now like as the Lord hath mercy on whom he will in pardoning their ſinne, and healing it by faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: So he hardeneth whom he will by denying faith and repentance. So that as God of his mere pleaſure grants the grace of faith and repentance unto ſome; ſo of his mere plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he denies it unto others. And ſo in Reprobation he decreeth of his mere pleaſure to deny it. But albeit the Lord of mere pleaſure proceeds in the denying of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whereby alone ſinne is cured, and ſo of mere pleaſure ſuffers ſome finally to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in ſinne, yet in inflicting damnation he doth not carry himſelfe of mere pleaſure without all reſpect to men's workes; but herein he proceeds according to a law which is this, <hi>whoſoever believeth not, and repenteth not, ſhall be damned.</hi> And like as God damnes noe man but for his finall perſeverance in ſinne. So from everlaſting he did decree to damne noe man, but for his finall perſeverance in ſinne. So that by vertue of the Divine decree of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56120:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reprobation, ſinne and finall perſeverance therein is conſtituted the cauſe of damnation; but by noe meanes is it conſtituted the cauſe of the decree of reprobation; neither doth the foreſight of ſinne precede it. For firſt, like as upon this doctrine, that, <hi>Grace is not given according unto workes,</hi> the abſoluteneſſe of predeſtination is grounded in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Auſtine</hi> as by neceſſary conſequence iſſuing there from: In like ſort upon this, that grace is not denied according unto men's workes, as neceſſarily followeth the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſſe of Reprobation. Secondly, looke by what reaſon the Apoſtle proves, that Election is not of good workes, namely becauſe, <hi>before the children were borne or had done any good, it was ſaid the Elder ſhall ſerve the Yonger;</hi> by the ſame reaſon it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that reprobation is not of evill workes, becauſe, <hi>before they were borne or had done good or evill, it was ſaid the Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger, Eſau's</hi> reprobation being as emphatically ſignified under his ſubjection to <hi>Iacob</hi> his younger, as <hi>Iacob's</hi> election was deſigned by his dominion over <hi>Eſau</hi> his Elder brother. 3. If ſinne be the cauſe of the decree of Reprobation, then either of 'its own nature, or by conſtitution divine. Not by neceſſity of nature; for undoubtedly God could annihilate men for ſinne, had it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him. If by conſtitution Divine, mark what abſurdity followeth, namely this, that, <hi>God did ordaine that upon foreſight of ſinne, he would ordaine men unto damnation.</hi> 4. If fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of ſinne precedes the decree of damning them for ſin, then the decree to permit ſin much more precedes the decree to damne them for it, as without which there can be noe foreſight of ſin; and conſequently permiſſion of ſin is firſt in intention, and then damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore it ſhould be laſt in execution; that is, men ſhould firſt be damned, and afterwards permitted to ſin, to wit, in an other world. 5. And laſtly Reprobation is the will of God; but there can be noe cauſe of God's will, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath proved; much leſſe can a temporall thing be the cauſe of God's will, which is eternall. Upon this ground it is that <hi>Aquinas</hi> profeſſeth, <hi>Never any man was ſo mad, as to ſay that any thing might be the cauſe of predeſtination, as touching the act of God predeſtinating.</hi> So may I ſay, it were a mad thing to maintaine that any thing can be the cauſe of Reprobation, as touching the act of God reprobating. For the caſe is altogether alike; the will of God being alike un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of a cauſe in both, whereas this Authour ſaith, that, <hi>God by our opinion doth draw men on by his unconquerable power from ſin to ſin;</hi> 'tis mere bumbaſt. All men being borne in ſin muſt needs perſevere in ſin, unleſſe God gives grace to regenerate them. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they doe that which is morally good, they doe it not in a gracious manner; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they abſtaine from evill, they doe it not in a gracious manner. <hi>He that is of God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi>

For <hi>ens &amp; bonum convertuntur, every thing that is an entity ſo farre is good,</hi> but he hath no efficiency as touching the evill, as which indeed can admit no efficiencie, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath delivered of old, Man himſelfe is only a deficient cauſe of ſin, as ſin, and that in a cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable manner, which kind of deficiency is not incident to God.

                        <p>It is true the Fathers made ſin the object of preſcience, not of predeſtination; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was becauſe they took predeſtination to be only of ſuch things which God did effect in time; Now ſin is none of thoſe things that come to paſſe by God's effection, but only by God's permiſſion.

But if God doth will that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; then either he wills it abſolutely or conditionally; If abſolutely, then the cauſe is gained. For then that which was firſt willed, was willed alſo abſolutely not condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally. As for example, if God wills a man's ſalvation upon condition of faith, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all God's will be, and that abſolutely to give him faith, it followeth that God wills that man's ſalvation, and that abſolutely. If it be anſwered that the condition is willed not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, but upon another condition; of that other condition I enquire whether God willed it or noe. If noe, then ſomething is produced in the world, in the production whereof God, hath no hand, which is very inconvenient; If you grant that he willed that alſo, I farther demand whether he willed it abſolutely or conditionally? If abſolutely then all that depended thereupon were abſolutely willed, and ſo the cauſe is obtained. If you ſay this condition was willed alſo conditionally, ſo a way is made to a progreſſion <hi>in infinitum,</hi> which is a thing unſufferable by the conſent of all. And as many as are put to give inſtance will forthwith manifeſt the nakednes of their cauſe. This demonſtration of <hi>Bradwardine</hi> I ſometimes repreſented to this very Authour in our private walking and communication, and he profeſſed it was a very ingenious argument.

Firſt theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients are about 850 yeares after Chriſt; yet marvailous orthodoxe conſidering thoſe times in the point of predeſtination. And let no man think that they deny a neceſſity of ſinning laid upon all by originall corruption, the conſequent of <hi>Adam's</hi> prevarication. If they were of any other opinion, ſhould it become us to follow them in this? Doctor <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> acknowledgeth it as the doctrine of the Church of England, that <hi>libertas à peccato, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from ſinne,</hi> is not incident to a naturall man; it is true he deſires to quaſh it by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is yet in man, <hi>Libertas à neceſſitate, à liberty from neceſſitie;</hi> but from what neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity? From the neceſſity of ſinning? If ſo, why ſhould he then deny a liberty from ſin; yet he never taketh any paines to cleare this from contradiction, but blindfoldly followes <hi>Bernard,</hi> without caring much to underſtand him. And he looks to be pardoned becauſe <hi>Voſſius</hi> did ſo before him. M. <hi>Fulke,</hi> in his anſwer to the <hi>Rhemiſh Teſtament,</hi> uſually diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth between <hi>libertas à peccato, &amp; libertas à coactione, liberty from ſinne, and liberty from conſtraint;</hi> and denying all liberty from ſinne to a naturall man, yet grants unto him a liberty from coaction. I have taken ſome paines to ſhew Doctor <hi>Potter's</hi> ſuperficiary carriage in this, and to cleare <hi>Bernard;</hi> which it may be I will adde to this by the reaſon of the homogeneous nature of it. In the meane time <hi>liberty from ſinne</hi> is utterly denied to a naturall man, and that by the doctrine of our Church. And noe marvaile ſeeing <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> himſelfe, and <hi>Corvinus,</hi> thoſe great patrons of natures power, doe acknowledg this, as before I mentioned; only they ſay God is ready to remove this neceſſitie of ſinning from all, and every one.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But the meaning of <hi>Remigius</hi> and the Church of Lyons is the ſame with that of <hi>Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> formerly mentioned, in his anſwer to the objection of <hi>Vincentius,</hi> where he confeſſeth, <hi>Hominem non redemptum Diabolo eſſe captivum, a man not redeemed is captivated by Satan;</hi> and that, <hi>creatura peccatrix poenalem dominationem Diaboli merito patitur, cui (relicto vero domino) ſponte ſe vendidit. The creature ſinning deſervedly ſuffers the dominion of Satan by way of puniſhment, as to whom he ſould him ſelfe voluntarily. Haec quippe ſervitus non inſtitutio eſt Dei ſed judicium. This ſlavery of man to Satan is not God's inſtitution but judgment;</hi> that is God brought it upon him not of his mere pleaſure, but in the way of judgment. Like as <note place="margin">

So <hi>Remigius</hi> and the Chuch of Lyons ſay; that God impoſed it not on <hi>Adam</hi> but man falling from God brought a neceſſitie of ſinning upon him, &amp; upon all his race; God hereupon juſtly withdrawing his holy Spirit from him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2.

He had more reaſon to father his next paſſage, which he produceth out of <hi>Remigius</hi> upon the Church of Lyons.

For whereas <hi>Scotus</hi> taught, that a man had not loſt his <hi>liberty, but only the power and vigour of his liberty. Florus</hi> oppoſeth him thus, <hi>Non rectè dicit, quia nec ſentit, he ſaith not well, becauſe he thinks not well; ſed ſicut vigorem &amp; poteſtatem libertatis, ita ipſam perdidit libertatem, ut jam ipſe ad verum bonum</hi>

                           <hi>unde cecidit liber eſſe non poſſit. As he hath loſt the vigour and power of his libertie; ſo he hath loſt libertie it ſelfe, inſomuch that unto true good, from whence he is fallen, he cannot be free;</hi> to wit, untill he be freed by the grace of Chriſt. In like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner <hi>Remigius</hi> diſcourſeth alſo, gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting free will only to evill, <hi>p.</hi> 36. <hi>In infidelibus id ipſum liberu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> arbitriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ita per Adam damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; perditum, in operibus mortuis liberum eſſe poteſt, in vivis non poteſt. In infidells free will it ſelfe, ſo damned and loſt in Adam, may be free in dead workes, cannot be free in living works</hi> that is, is not free to produce works belonging to a ſpirituall life. So that they una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly confeſſe that in reſpect of originall ſin, there is a neceſſity of ſinning, but this is rightly to be underſtood; namely thus, that true good they cannot doe, ſo that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they doe is evill, only that it is free unto them to doe this or that evill, which is moſt true. Secondly, thus farre they qualifie this neceſſitie of ſinning, that never any man is carried by the Divine providence, ſo as to ſinne whether they will or no. For albeit <hi>Raba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> charged them, whom he oppoſed herewith, <hi>pag.</hi> 53. <hi>Si enim ſecundum ipſos qui talia ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiunt, Dei praedeſtinatio invitum hominem facit peccare, quomodo Deus juſto judicio, damnat peccantem, cum ille non voluntate, ſed neceſſitate peccaverit. For if, according to them who thinke ſuch things, God's predeſtination makes a man to ſinne againſt his will; how doth God in his juſt judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t damne him that ſinneth, when he ſinned not voluntarily but neceſſarily?</hi> Thus they cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated their adverſaries: but <hi>Remigius</hi> anſwers on their behalfe, who were thus falſly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Nemo ita ſentit aut dicit quod Dei predeſtinatio aliquem invitum faciat peccare, ut jam non propriae voluntatis perverſitate, ſed divinae praedeſtinationis neceſſitate peccare videatur. No man ſo thinks or ſpeakes, that God's predeſtination makes a man to ſinne againſt his will; ſo that a man ſhould ſeeme to ſinne, not by the perverſitie of his own will, but by the neceſſitie of divine predeſtination. But this is the worke of Divine predeſtination, that he who ſins willingly, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveres willingly in his ſins, ſhall againſt his will be puniſhed.</hi> And the truth is taking predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as it ſignifies preparation of Grace, or God's decree to conferre this, rather God's not predeſtinating a man, or not giving grace, and not making him to be of God, is the cauſe why a man ſinneth, according to that of our Saviour. <hi>He that is of God heareth God's</hi>

For ſinne is as a ſweet morſell, which they roule under their tongue. This may ſuffice for anſwer unto theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and withall to repreſent the vanitie of this Authour's diſcourſe, endeavouring to brand our doctrine with making God the Authour of ſinne; more of this hereafter; For I am acquainted with that which he here conceales, and with certaine adjuncts thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, both touching the opinion of the Church of Lyons concerning falling from grace; as alſo this Authours bold adventure in two particulars in juſtifying <hi>Voſſius,</hi> citing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of <hi>Pelagius</hi> as one of <hi>Auſtin's</hi> ſermons; as alſo defending him in the point of the predeſtinarian hereſie, which Doctor <hi>Uſher</hi> maintaines to be a mere fiction of the <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelagians</hi> to bring <hi>Auſtin's</hi> doctrin thereby into diſgrace.

If God ſhould worke ſinne by an operative decree, then he ſhould be the Authour of ſinne, but not if he decree by a permiſſive decree to let it come to paſſe, and this only they ſay they maintaine. It is true that God hath decreed to ſuffer ſinne; for otherwiſe there would be none. Who can bring forth that which God will abſolutely hinder? He ſuffered <hi>Adam</hi> to ſinne, leaving him in the hand of his own counſell, <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 15. 14. He ſuffered the nations in time paſt to walke in their own waies <hi>Act:</hi> 14. 16. And dayly doth he ſuffer both good and bad to fall into many ſins; And this he doth, not becauſe he ſtands in need of ſinne for the ſetting forth of his glory; for he hath noe need of the ſinfull man. <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 15. But partly becauſe he is <hi>(ſummus proviſor)</hi> ſupreme moderatour of the world, and knoweth how
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56120:209"/>
to uſe that well which is ill done, and to bring good out of evill; and eſpecially for that reaſon which <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> prelleth, namely, becauſe man is made by God's own gracious conſtitution, a free creature undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in his actions, untill he determine himſelfe; And therefore may not be hindred from ſinning by om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency, becauſe God uſeth not to repeale his own ordinances.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. It is true alſo that a permiſſive decree is noe cauſe of ſinne, becauſe it is merely extrinſecall to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and hath noe influence at all upon the ſinne. It is an antecedent only, and ſuch a one too, as being put, ſinne followeth not of neceſſitie. And therefore it is fitly contradiſtinguiſht to an operative decree. And if that ſide would in good earneſt, impute noe more in ſinfull events to divine power, then the word <hi>Permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> imports, their maine concluſion would fall, and the controverſy between, us end.

                           <p n="2">2. Permiſſion about whomſoever it is exerciſed, obſtinate ſinners, or men conſidered without ſinne, is no more then a not hindring of them from falling, that are able to ſtand, &amp; ſuppoſeth a poſſibility of ſinning or not ſinning, in the parties permitted; but with them it is a withdrawing or withholding of grace needfull for the avoiding of ſin, and ſo includeth an abſolute neceſſitie of ſinning.

                        <p>Here we have a very demure diſcourſe proceeding in a poſitive manner, proceeding from <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> one that takes upon him to be a Maſter and dictator of ſentences; wherein there is little or nothing ſound that he delivers of his own; or to purpoſe that he delivers of others.

And finding noe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent therein, I gave my ſelfe to enquire thereof in a poſitive manner; wherein I proceeded very farre, ſetting downe in foule papers, as they came to hand, whatſoever came into my mind thereabout, which grew into a large proportion, and then ſet my ſelfe upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived grounds reaſonably well diſſcurſſed by me, to deale with <hi>Arminius</hi> ſome five Sections after the beginning of his diſcourſe on this argument, which five firſt Sections I took not into examination, untill I had diſpatched the whole. And having an occaſion to deale upon this argument when I came to the defence of M. <hi>Perkins</hi> his anſwer to the third crimination, whereupon I deale in the ſecond book of my <hi>Vindiciae,</hi> I thought good to digreſſe after the ſecond Section, &amp; to call a certaine propoſition of M. <hi>Perkins</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which was this, <hi>Quod Deus non impedit, ideo evenit, quia Deus non impedit.</hi> It is the

third Digreſſion of the ſecond book, the title whereof is this, <hi>Propoſitio illa Perkinſii (quod Deus non impedit, ideo evenit, quia Deus non impedit) ſub examen revocatur.</hi> There is noe digreſſion throughout that book of mine that affords more variety of Philoſophicall and Theologicall contemplations, then that; and all about the nature of permiſſion.

In the courſe whereof many obſcurities and difficulties doe offer themſelves to be cleared, &amp; ſolved by diſtinction; where comming to an end, I deliver my ſelfe in this manner. <hi>I perceive in how ſlippery an argument I exerciſe my ſelfe, too much expoſed to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny of adverſaries, and too apt to incurre the diſlike of good men; whereas in all my labour I aime at nothing elſe, then according to my power to explicate the myſtery of Divine providence governing all things after a wonderfull manner; And to diſſemble nothing, but repreſent all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that doe occurre, that both my adverſaries may have at hand what to impugne; Our Divines wherein to take paines, either by way of explication of what yet remaines obſcure; or by confirmation of what they ſhall find to be ſound yet unſufficiently proved.</hi> Now that Digreſſion of mine being ſo large, I wonder not a little that no one particular thereof is here called to an account by this Divine. And ſo may others too when they ſhall conſider againſt whom this man's ſtomach workes moſt. For he cannot be ignorant of my anſwer to M. <hi>Hoord</hi> his proſelyte, if not therein to himſelfe. Againe, the exception here in the laſt place taken againſt our doctrine of permiſſion, is exactly the ſame with <hi>Arminius</hi> his excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> in dealing upon the third crimination, which there I have anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at large, and that in ſuch manner, that I willingly profeſſe, I was utterly to ſeek at this time, of what I had there delivered; ſo that upon my conſulting the place, the things I there met with, ſeemed new unto me, in diſcovering many waies the inconſequence of <hi>Arminius</hi> his diſcourſe, which yet is the very ſame with this of Mr. <hi>Maſon's.</hi> Yet he hath not replied upon any one line of all that I delivered there, though they are above 600 in the ſecond Edition of that book. But it may be he takes that for noe better then an idle diſcourſe (yet an anſwer it is to this very exception of his) &amp; 'tis enough for him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the juſtneſſe of that exception made by <hi>Arminius,</hi> by ſound argument. And what is that but a rule given by him, upon his own credit, without indication of the leaſt autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to confirme it; And though on the contrary I have divers and ſundry waies manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the falſenes thereof: well I am not reſolved to ſuffer him to paſſe unanſwered, how idle ſoever his diſcourſe may appeare to be. Foure diſtinctions of ours he propoſeth to invade; not one of them is pretermitted by <hi>Arminius</hi> in his anſwer unto <hi>Perkins,</hi> nor any part of that his anſwer pretermitted by me. But this is written in Engliſh for the indoctrinating of the people, as I remember what was ſaid of <hi>M. Hoord's</hi> diſcourſe; namely, that it was fit to be coppied out, and communicated unto the Country. He ſaith theſe diſtinctions are, <hi>deluſions of the ſimple;</hi> when he proves it, then it will be time enough to believe it. But whereas, he ſaith, <hi>they give noe true ſatisfaction to the underſtanding,</hi> this is rightly to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, to wit, in reference to an <hi>Arminian</hi> underſtanding corrupted with the leaven of <hi>Pelagidniſme.</hi> Yet is he not privy to the underſtanding of all, ſo much as of all that are of his own Tenet. But ſuppoſe they doe not. The diſtinctions uſed by School-Divines to accommodate God's predeſtination with man's free will, are many and learned, but <hi>Caietan</hi> profeſſeth of them all that they doe not, <hi>quietare intellectum, ſatisfie the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;</hi> but what followes; Therefore ſaith he, <hi>Ego captivo meum in obſequium fidei; I capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate mine unto the obedience of faith</hi> to wit, becauſe Scripture is evident for both: And why ſhould it seeme ſtrange that God's providence in governing the world ſhould be of a myſterious nature. And however this Authour may cenſure <hi>Caietane</hi> in this, yet <hi>Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> profeſſeth that herein, <hi>doctiſſimè, &amp; piiſſimè loquitur; he ſpeakes moſt learnedly and moſt piouſly.</hi> Yet permiſſion, in the judgment of <hi>Suarez,</hi> is not merely a negation of prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but conjunct with a poſitive operation in concurring to the act of ſinne; which <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> hath proved to be <hi>à Deo, from God,</hi> though the obliquity of the act be not. And the truth is, man himſelfe is not operative in ſinne, otherwiſe then as touching the ſubſtance of the act. For ſinne, as ſinne <hi>hath noe cauſe efficient, but deficient only,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath long agoe delivered; neither hath he been oppoſed herein by any that I know. Obſerve how with him to <hi>hinder,</hi> and <hi>abſolutely to hinder</hi> is made all one; yet <hi>to will,</hi> and <hi>abſolutely to will</hi> in God, is not all one in his opinion. I doe not find that God left <hi>Adam</hi> in the hand of his counſell. For he forbade him to eate of the forbidden fruit, which is ſomewhat more then to diſſwade from it. And yet to perſwade or diſſwade another, is not to leave him in the hands of his own counſells. For it is to impart unto him another counſell. Yet though we diſſwade a brother, and ſo not leave him in the hand of his own counſell; yet we ſtill
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56120:210" rendition="simple:additions"/>
leave him to his own free will. Both theſe I have inſiſted upon more at large in the ſecond book in my <hi>Vindiciae, Sect:</hi> 2. <hi>Digreſ.</hi> 3. It is true God hath noe need of ſetting forth his own glory, noe more then he hath need of making the world; but the exiſtence of ſin may be and is neceſſarily required to the ſetting forth of God's glory in ſome attributes of his. For neither can the glory of God's mercy appeare in pardoning ſinne, nor the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his vindicative juſtice, (called in Scripture his wrath, <hi>Rom:</hi> 9. 23.) in puniſhing ſinne, unleſſe there be ſinne to be pardoned, and ſinne to be puniſhed: Nor the glory of his power and wiſedome in working good out of evill, unleſſe God give way to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of Evill. And if upon God's permiſſion of ſinne, it be not neceſſary that ſinne exiſt, then it is not in the Allmighty power of God infallibly to procure the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of his glory, either in the way of mercy pardoning it, or in the way of juſtice puniſhing it. But ſeeing theſe reaſons are not conſiderable with this ſupercilious <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> it ſhould ſeeme likely, that looke what he ſubſtitutes in the place thereof, will prove ſubſtantiall, and ſatisfie ſuch underſtandings as his own: And that he repreſents out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> namely, <hi>becauſe man is made by God a free creature.</hi> This reaſon was repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Arminius</hi> before him, and that out of <hi>Tertullian, Arminius</hi> his huskes are pleaſing <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Lib:</hi> 1. <hi>cont: Marcion.</hi>
                           </note> to him. Such was the condition of the prodigall child when he forſooke his Father; the provender of Swine was acceptable to him. Yet he could not have enough of that. Is not man a free creature to performe naturall acts as well as morall; and morall good as well as evill? Nay are not the Children of God made free by Chriſt to the performance of actions ſpirituall? What therefore muſt God only permit them to performe them, and by noe meanes worke them to the performance of faith, and repentance, and all manner of obedience; yea and keep them from ſinning againſt him, as he kept <hi>Abimelech, Gen:</hi> 20? See how this Authour diſplaies himſelfe ere he was aware; and withall what the reaſon is why he affects to deale upon reprobation only, not upon election or grace leaſt his vile opinion miſerably defacing the glory of God's grace might appeare with open face in 'its proper colours. Yet it breakes forth more then he could wiſh, in ſetting down the end why God permits ſinne, to wit, becauſe men are free creatures, therefore it becomes not God to worke their wills to this or that, but only to permit them to doe what they will; if they will ſinne to permit them; if they would doe any good worke whether it be faith or repentance, or any other good worke, or to abſtaine from ſinne, to permit that alſo; whereby it is apparent that God by his opinion hath noe more hand in working a man to any good worke (excepting the act of commanding and perſwading the one, and not the other) then in working them unto evill. For becauſe they are free creatures, therefore it becomes God to leave them unto themſelves, and permit them to doe what they will, whether it be good or evill: otherwiſe God ſhould nullifie his own inſtitution in making them free Agents. Yet conſider farther how herein he contradicts the very principles of his own ſide, both <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Ieſuites.</hi> For <hi>Arminius</hi> maintaines that God can hinder a man effectually from the committing of ſinne without any prejudice to the liberty of their wills. The like doe the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> maintaine in their doctrine of grace effectuall in the way of congruity, namely, that God can bring any man to faith, to obedience, to any good worke, and accordingly preſerve him from any ſinne by vertue of grace effectuall, which is ſhaped by them in ſuch a manner, as to be noe way prejudiciall to the liberty of their wills. But <hi>Tertullians</hi> authority hath abuſed his fancy, and expoſed him to lay open himſelfe in ſo ſhamefull a manner. Yet <hi>Tertullian</hi> will not ſerve his turn any more, then it doth ſerve <hi>Arminius</hi> his turne, as I have ſhewed in my anſwer to <hi>Arminius lib.</hi> 1. <hi>part. prima de praedeſt. Sect:</hi> 7, and that at large. Secondly, the reaſons he brings for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinction of decree permiſſive, from decree operative, are very vaine. For 1, the decree operative is extrinſecall to the ſinner, as well as the decree permiſſive. Secondly, neither hath it any influence at all upon the ſinne (as which admits noe efficient cauſe thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a mere privative nature) but upon the ſubſtance of the act, which I preſume this Authour will not deny. Thirdly, the decree permiſſive is not an antecedent only, but ſuch as being put, ſinne followes of neceſſitie, as well as upon the poſition of the decree ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative; that is of neceſſitie, by ſuppoſition, not neceſſity abſolute. For as <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered and proved, not only the things themſelves come to paſſe by vertue of God's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, but, <hi>modi rerum, ſeverall conditions of them.</hi> As for example, neceſſary things, neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; contingent things, contingently; free actions, freely; And that thus the things permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted do alwaies come to paſſe, not only <hi>Piſcator</hi> with our Divines, as Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi> and <hi>Pareus</hi> doe avouch, but <hi>Vorſtius</hi> alſo and <hi>Arminius,</hi> as I have ſhewed in my <hi>Vindiciae, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>digreſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Arminius</hi> his words are theſe, if God permits a man to will this or
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56120:211"/>
that, <hi>neceſſe eſt, it muſt needs be, ut nullo argumentorum genere perſuadeatur ad nolendum, that no kind of argument move him to will it. Navarettus</hi> the <hi>Dominican</hi> profeſſeth the ſame, in <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 19. <hi>pag. prima art.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 65. <hi>col:</hi> 1.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That this deſtinction is rejected by our Divines this Authour brings no tollerable evidence. As for <hi>Beza</hi> here it is confeſſed, that he acknowledgeth God to permit ſinne, and whereas he addes that he wills it too, it is nothing contradictory to the former. For to permit ſinne (ſpeaking of permiſſion divine) is to will that ſinne ſhall come to paſſe by God's permiſſion. And <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath profeſſed of thoſe things that come to paſſe by God's <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Enchirid.</hi> 9. 5</note> permiſſion, that they come to paſſe, <hi>Deo volente, God willing them.</hi> And the Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth as much, that the Kings in proſtituting their Royall authority, to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the pleaſure of the Beaſt, did herein fulfill the will of God. So that God's permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive decree is as effectuall in its kind, as the operative decree in 'its kind; thus farre, that like as what God meanes to worke ſhall come to paſſe; ſo look what God meanes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that alſo ſhall come to paſſe. Neither doe I know any Arminian or Jeſuite, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies God's operative decree, as touching the very act of ſinne, by way of concurrence in the producing of it. When <hi>Calvin</hi> will have the evill of ſinne come to paſſe, <hi>Deo volente, God willing it,</hi> he denies not any more then <hi>Beza</hi> doth, that it comes to paſſe by God's permiſſion of it. But <hi>Calvin</hi> reſts not in a bare permiſſions and no marvaile. For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith not, that God permitted <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to refuſe to let Iſrael goe, but plainly and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergetically thus; <hi>I will harden Pharaoh's heart that he ſhall not let Iſrael goe, I will harden Pharaoh's heart that he ſhall follow after them, I will rent the Kingdome from Solomon;</hi> not I will permit it to be rented; and ſo throughout. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe contents not himſelfe with a bare permiſſion, but farther ſaith, God doth <hi>rule and governe the wills of wicked men;</hi> yea, <hi>torquet &amp; flectit, he wreſts and bends them.</hi> And <hi>Auſtin</hi> often ſaith, he <hi>enclines them</hi> unto evill. And whereas it is farther added out of <hi>Calvin</hi> that <hi>a man is blind, volente &amp; ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bente Deo, God willing and commanding it.</hi> Is it not expreſſe Scripture, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Make the heart of this people fat, make their eares heavy, and ſhut their eyes.</hi> So that <hi>Calvin</hi> doth but accomodate himſelfe to Scripture phraſe. But when we come to the explication of this either in Chriſtian reaſon, or by comparing one place of Scripture with an other, we ſay that to <hi>Make their hearts fat, their eares heavy, and to ſhut their eys: And to give them the</hi>

And he ſaid, I will goe out and be a falſe Spirit in the mouth of all his Prophets. Calvin</hi> goes on, <hi>Mittitur cum</hi>

                              <hi>verſ.</hi> 22.</note> might not as well calumniate the Holy Ghoſt the Inditer of this Scripture, as <hi>Calvin</hi> who proceeds but according unto Scripture in that which he delivers. Now let every ſober man judge whether hereby it doth not manifeſtly appeare, <hi>Excoecari Achabum, that Ahab was blinded by the Devill, Deo volente ac jubente, the Lord willing and commanding it;</hi> but this taken apart from the inſtance in reference whereunto it is delivered, a man might ſuſpect his meaning were, that God commands a man to ſhut his own eyes, &amp; blind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And judge I pray whether to ſay, that this whole providence of God concerning <hi>Ahab,</hi> was no more then permiſſion, deſerves not to be called, <hi>figmentum, a fiction,</hi> as indeed <hi>Calvin</hi> calleth it. To this he addes the joynt profeſſion of the Apoſtles touching God's providence in crucifying of Chriſt; in <hi>Abſalom's</hi> inceſt, the <hi>Chaldees</hi> bloudy execution in the land of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> before them, which in Scripture is called the worke of <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Act:</hi> 4. 28. <hi>Act:</hi> 2. 23. 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 16. 22, <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. 12.</note> God &amp;c. And concludes it to be manifeſt, <hi>Nugari eos &amp; ineptire, qui in locum providentiae Dei nudam permiſſionem ſubſtituunt, that they doe but toy and trifle, who in place of God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſubſtitute a naked permiſſion.</hi> And this Authour doth but calumniate <hi>Calvin's</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, in rendring the word <hi>ineptire,</hi> by <hi>playing the foole. Ineptire</hi> in the proprietie
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56120:211"/>
thereof, is in this caſe to faile of fit and congruous interpretation and accommodation. And may he not juſtly taxe <hi>thoſe who underſtand ſuch Scriptures, as ſpeake of God's ſmiting men with the Spirit of ſlumber and giddineſſe, of blinding their mindes, infatuating and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their hearts of a permiſſion, and ſuffering of men to be blinded and hardned?</hi> I had thought common ſenſe might have juſtified him in this; taking <hi>Calvin</hi> aright, who denies not <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> in all this, but <hi>nudam permiſſionem, naked permiſſion;</hi> as much as to ſay theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture paſſages doe ſignifie more then permiſſion; And as I have ſaid before <hi>Bellarmin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth not ſatisfie himſelfe with a naked permiſſion in ſuch like providence divine as here is mentioned. I thinke he may juſtly ſay that to explicate <hi>excecation</hi> and <hi>obduration</hi> by permiſſion is ſuch an explication as will ſatisfie no ſober man, and that ſuch a ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is <hi>too frivolous.</hi> And as for God's preſcience, it is apparent that the horrible outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges committed upon the holy Son of God, the Scripture teſtifies not to have been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen only by God, but by the hand and counſell of God predetermined alſo; &amp; more then this, cleare reaſon doth juſtifie that the ground of God's foreknowing ought, is his foredetermining of it, as I have often proved by invincible demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Who miſtakes the nature of permiſſion moſt, we or this cenſurer, let the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent judge. It is apparent that he puts no difference between permiſſion humane, and permiſſion Divine. Sure I am <hi>Suarez</hi> requires to permiſſion divine a concurrence to the act, the obliquity whereof is permitted. And more then that both <hi>Scotus</hi> of old without queſtion, and the <hi>Dominicans</hi> of late, and <hi>Bradwardine</hi> before them maintaine this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence to be by way of determining the will to every act thereof. But all theſe miſtake the nature of permiſſion, if we believe this Authour upon his word where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he carrieth himſelfe very authoritatively, no Pope like him. Yet he is ready to give his reaſon for it, though with manifeſt contradiction to himſelfe, but let us conſider it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Permiſſion is an act of God's conſequent and judiciary will, by which he puniſheth men for abuſing their freedom &amp;c.</hi> Moſt untrue, and manifeſtly convictable of untruth by that which himſelfe delivered but a little before in this very Section, where he ſaid, It is true that God hath decreed to ſuffer ſinne; for otherwiſe there would be none. By this it is manifeſt that whenſoever ſinne is committed, there had place God's permiſſion of ſinne, otherwiſe there would have been no ſinne, therefore permiſſion had place in the very firſt ſinne that was committed by man, and Angells. Judge Reader with what felicity he comes to cenſure and correct the miſtakes of others about permiſſion. As <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaid of one oppoſing him, <hi>noverit ſe eſſe obduratum;</hi> ſo mayeſt thou not ſay of this Authour in this diſcourſe of his, <hi>noverit ſe eſſe excaecatum,</hi> let him take notice how him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is blinded? <hi>The Lord giving Iſrael up to their own hearts luſts;</hi> he like a reſolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor will have to proceed by way of mere permiſſion. Yet the Lord ſaith not, he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pſ:</hi> 81. 11. 12,</note> them to their own luſts; and <hi>Rom:</hi> 1. 24, 26, 28. Obſerve, firſt looke what he permitted came to paſſe throughout, even to abominable courſes. Secondly, obſerve, the judgment of God is noted herein. <hi>They received the recompence of their own errour as was meet.</hi> What? And are God's judgments executed only by God's permiſſion, and that by the hands of them that are judged and puniſhed? Such is the accuratenes of this Authours divinity comming to correct the miſtakes of others about permiſſion. And for the proofe of all this we have this Authour's bare word without any reaſon or authority repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him. As for that of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> not <hi>chap:</hi> 18. 39, but <hi>chap:</hi> 20. 39 <hi>Goe and ſerve every one his Idels;</hi> this hath the forme of a command, rather then of a permiſſion; but the Lord hereby ſignifies, that in ſerving him, while they ſerve other Gods, they doe but profane his holy name in ſerving him, and undoubtedly they provoked God more hereby, then the heathens who ſerved not him at all, but other Gods only. So that the Lord ſeemes to ſignifie, that he had rather, they ſhould not ſerve him at all, as <hi>Revelations</hi> 3. I would thou wer'ſt either hot or cold, but ſeeing thou art luke-warme, I will ſpue thee out of my mouth; But be it as the Authour would have it, did here God begin to permit them? their former diſobedience was it not a conſequent of God's permiſſion? For if God had not permitted their diſobedience, ſurely it had not been by the Authours diſcourſe in the beginning of this Section. As touching that <hi>Revelations</hi> 22. 11. I hope by the ſame rule of this poſitive <hi>Theologue,</hi> not only their continuing to be unjuſt, was by God's permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but their firſt being and beginning to be unjuſt was by God's permiſſion alſo. And ſurely if this man's word be of any credit, all ſinners were firſt permitted to ſinne, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56120:212"/>
they had never ſinned, and not the obſtinate and willfull only. Were not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells innocent before their firſt ſin? was not <hi>Adam</hi> innocent before his firſt ſin? and did not God permit both Angells and men to ſin their firſt ſin? If not; what truth is in this authour's word, when he ſaid, <hi>God hath decreed to ſuffer ſin? for otherwiſe there would be none.</hi> And if he be not worthy to be believed, in this his credit is crackt, and deſerves not to be believed in ought.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. We have been more beholding unto this Authour, ſince he came to meet with our diſtinctions, then throughout all his former diſcourſe; as I have ſhewed already in part, &amp; ſhall diſcover more by God's helpe (not his permiſſion only) ere we part from this. He ſeemes to be conſcious of ſome thing and fearefull of giving too much advantage, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by his expreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when he ſaith that <hi>permiſſion</hi> (of ſin; for ſo he ſhould ſay) <hi>ſuppoſeth a poſſibility of ſinning or not ſinning.</hi> Now this is nothing congruous to his former expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions whereby it was made to ſuppoſe that, <hi>a man is able to ſtand.</hi> For to be able to ſtand, is to have an active power in him whereby he is able to ſtand; but to have a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſtanding, or not ſinning is not ſo. For though a man hath no power in himſelfe to ſtand or to abſtaine from ſinne, yet if there be a power in God to makehim ſtand, and to preſerve him from falling, this is ſufficient to make good, that a man hath a poſſibility of ſtanding and abſtaining from ſinne. And we are willing to confeſſe that God is able not only to preſerve any man that ſtands from falling, but alſo to raiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Hiſt: Goteſch: pag.</hi> 142.</note> man that is fallen; and to make him ſtand. Thus <hi>Florus, Habet homo poſt illam dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationem liberum arbitrium, quo propriâ voluntate inclinari poteſt &amp; inclinatur ad malum, habet liberum arbitrium quo poſſit aſſurgere ad bonum; Ut autem aſſurgat ad bonum, non eſt propriae virtutis, ſed gratiae Dei miſerantis. Nam &amp; qui mortuus eſt dici poteſt poſſe vivere, non tamen ſuâ virtute, ſed Dei. Ita &amp; liberum arbitrium hominis ſemel ſauciatum, ſemel mortuum poteſt ſanari, non tamen ſuâ virtutè, ſed gratiâ miſerantis Dei. Et ideo omnes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines admonentur, omnibus verbum praedicatur, quia habent poſſe credere, poſſe converti ad Deum; ut verbo extrinſecus admonente, &amp; Deo intus ſuſcitante, qui audiunt, reviviſcant. After Adam's fall man hath free will, whereby of his own accord he may be and is inclined unto evill, he hath free will whereby he may ariſe unto that which is good; but to ariſe unto Good is not of his own power, but of Gods grace commiſerating. For of him alſo who is dead, it may be ſaid, that he may live, yet not of his own power, but by the power of God. So the free will of men being once wounded, once dead may be healed not by 'its own power, but by the grace of God ſhewing mercy. And therefore all men are admoniſhed, the word is preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, becauſe this they have that they may believe, they may be converted unto God; to the end that by the word admoniſhing outwardly, and God ſtirring them up inwardly, they which heare may be revived.</hi> Obſerve by the way a manifeſt incongruity in ſaying that <hi>permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> is a not <hi>hindring them from falling, who are able to ſtand</hi> For they who are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to fall, and not hindered from falling, are ſuppoſed to ſtand, and not only to be able to ſtand. It ſeemes this Authour cannot endure that <hi>Permiſſion of ſinne,</hi> ſhould conſiſt <hi>in the withholding of a grace needfull, to abſtaine from ſinne.</hi> Whence it followeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently that in this Authour's opinion, either God's permiſſion of ſinne is not the withholding of any grace at all; or if it be it is the withholding only of ſuch a grace, without which nevertheleſſe man may keep himſelfe from ſinne; and conſequently, though ſuch a grace be granted, yet it is indifferent for him to ſinne, as well as to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from ſinne; If it be no withholding of grace at all, it followes that like as when a man ſins it is not for want of grace: So when a man abſtaines from ſinne, it is not by vertue of any grace of God granted him thereunto; Yet the Lord tells <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Gen:</hi> 20. 6.</note> King <hi>Abimelech</hi> expreſly <hi>I kept thee from ſinning againſt me.</hi> If he pretends that ſome grace is withheld whenſoever a man ſinneth, but will not ſay that is was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the avoiding of ſinne it followeth that when man is permitted to ſinne, he is no more apt to ſinne, then while ſuch grace was denied him, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no more apt to abſtaine from ſinne when ſuch a grace is granted him, and conſequently in granting ſuch a grace he permits him ſtill to ſinne, as well as in denying it; and in denying he permits him to doe good, as much as in granting it; So that ſtill it is not God that keepeth a man from ſinne, as often as he abſtaineth from it, but merely the power of his own free will. Whereby it is evident that this Authour as well denies, that God is the Authour of any good, as that he is the Authour of any evill: But man is Authour of the one as well as of the other. The power of doing good he will grant is from God, neither can it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that the power of doing evill is from God. He will grant likewiſe that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56120:212"/>
God is ready to concurre to any good act if man will, and I preſume he will not deny, but that God concurres alſo to the ſubſtance of every evill act. The only difference that remaines is this; God perſwades only to good, and diſſwades only that which is evill. Now this third and laſt aſſertion we grant as well as he. Yet he layes to our charge that we make God the Authour of evill, but cares not at all how he denies God to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of any good in the actions of men, and makes noe place for any grace ſave ſuch, as is hortatory, which is performed uſually by the miniſtery of men. Yet conſider what <hi>Bradwardine</hi> ſometimes Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury Elect hath written in this kind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin</hi> were borne. The title of the fourth chapter of his ſecond booke is this. <hi>That free will being tempted cannot of his own ſtrength without the helpe of God and his grace overcome any temptation.</hi> Of the firſt this, <hi>that free will ſtrengthned with what crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted grace ſoever cannot without another ſpeciall ſuccour of God overcome any temptation.</hi> of the ſixth this, that, <hi>That ſpeciall ſuccour of God is the unconquerable grace of God.</hi> Of the ſeventh this; <hi>That no man though not tempted, can by the ſtrength of his free will alone without created grace or with created grace, how great ſoever it be, without the ſpeciall aſiſtance of God avoide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſin:</hi> &amp; all theſe propoſitions he demonſtrates with variety of argument. Behold the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of this Authour; He flies in the face of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> and other our Divines, for maintaining that unleſſe God by his grace keep and preſerve a man effectually from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it cannot be that he ſhould abſtaine from ſinne. <hi>Bradwardine</hi> maintained the ſame before any of theſe were borne yet he ſaith nothing to him, lets all his arguments alone; but upbraides us for maintaining the ſame doctrine, without giving any reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict us of our errour. Adde to this, which I have omitted, the Corolary of that ſeventh chapter in <hi>Bradwardin</hi> formerly mentioned is this, <hi>That it is the will of God, which preſerves them that are tempted from falling, and them that are not tempted, both from temptation and from ſinne.</hi> Not one of the arguments whereby he confirmes any of theſe poſitions, doth this Authour goe about to anſwer.

God is only the naturall cauſe why this their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall corruption continues uncured.

                           <hi>and ſo a cauſe deficient morally, may be efficient naturally.</hi> Leaſt of all can it have place in the preſent queſtion, which is of the cauſe of ſinne. For ſinne as ſinne, evill as evill, <hi>non habet cauſam efficientem, ſed deficientem; hath no cauſe efficient, but deficient</hi> only; as <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath long agoe determined; and it is a rule generally received and never that I know de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied of any. Againe <hi>cauſa deficiens in neceſſariis</hi> may be culpable I confeſſe, and ſo <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretativè</hi> (as they ſay) may be interpreted to be as good as an efficient. As in a civill conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration it is ſaid of the Magiſtrate, that, <hi>Qui non vetat peccare cum poſſit, jubet. He that forbiddeth not a man to ſinne when it is in his power, or when he hath authority to forbid, 'tis as if he ſhould command the committing of that ſin.</hi> Now this is only in ſuch a caſe, where the neceſſitie reſpects the perſon who is the deficient cauſe, as namely in caſe he be bound in duty to afford help and ſuccour to him that cannot keepe himſelfe from ſinning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſuccour of an other, not otherwiſe. And therefore it reacheth not to God, who is not bound to preſerve any man or creature from ſinning; Leaſt of all is he bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate a man that is borne in ſinne. <hi>Adam</hi> was created in all ſufficiency that the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature was capable of, without any pronenes unto evill, but rather in a morall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion to that which was good; And his fall hath brought this corruption upon all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, even a neceſſitie of ſinning, as <hi>Arminius</hi> and <hi>Corvinus</hi> confeſſe. He wanted no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to doe that which was good, or to abſtaine from ſin, but ever ſince his fall, impotency to that which is good, &amp; proneneſſe unto that which is evill hath been the naturall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of all mankind. And as for the permiſſion of <hi>Adam's</hi> fall, his ſin was in a thing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally indifferent, the holines of his nature not inclining him more to abſtain from that fruit any more, then to partake of it. Neither doe we ſay that God did withhold from <hi>Adam</hi> any grace that theſe our adverſaries maintaine to be neceſſary for the avoiding of that ſinne which was committed by him. How <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe was brought by <hi>Eve</hi> to eate of that fruit is not expreſſed. As for <hi>Eve</hi> the temptation which Satan uſed with her, &amp; which did prevaile is expreſſed: He allured her with the repreſentation of the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full nature of that, to make them as Gods knowing good and evill, &amp; he made this ſeem credible by the very denomination which God gave unto the Tree, <hi>the Tree of knowledge of good and evill.</hi> It ſeemes not likely that ſhe knew who it was that ſpake unto her in the Serpent, nor that ſhe was acquainted with the fall of Angells. Then againe <hi>the deſire of knowledge,</hi> is no evill thing it ſelfe, or ſtands in any contradiction to the integrity of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature: Nay nothing more agreeable to the nature of the beſt, it brings ſuch a perfection with it. Only the errour was, in affecting it this way. God did not keep the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill off; nor reveale unto her who it was that ſpake unto her; much leſſe his apoſtaticall condition; leaſt of all his project to ſupplant them. Neither did he quicken that holy feare which he had inſpired into her to reſiſt it at the firſt, &amp; to goe to her husband to acquaint him with it. She might thinke that the knowledge of good and evill might make her more fit for the ſervice of God, then unfit. All which conſidered, her will being moved to ſeek this perfection by taſting of ſuch a fruit, there was no cauſe or reaſon to hinder her from taſting it, ſave only the conſideration of God's prohibition. For the will of every rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature is naturally apt to affect that which is good, and though that good may prove evill in ſome circumſtance, yet if that circumſtance be not conſidered, the will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to affect it. How long the Devill was exerciſed in this temptation we know not. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſideration is conceived by <hi>Durandus</hi> to be the originall of that ſinne of theirs; and God was not bound to maintaine this conſideration quick in her, and of the danger of ſuch a tranſgreſſion. In fine ſhe came to a will &amp; reſolution to taſt of it; to the producing of this act, as a naturall thing, the Lord concurred, as all confeſſe, namely to the ſubſtance of the act. The queſtion is whether he concurred to the effecting of it abſolutely or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally? It was as true of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> that <hi>in him they lived and moved and had their being,</hi> as it is of us. We ſay God as a firſt cauſe moves every ſecond cauſe; but agreeably to their natures; Neceſſary agents to worke every thing they worke neceſſarily; Free agents to doe every thing they doe, freely. But to ſay that God made them <hi>velle modo vellent, to will in caſe they would will,</hi> is ſo abſurd as nothing more; The act of willing being hereby made the condition of it ſelfe, and conſequently both before and after it ſelfe.

not of the obliquitie and evill that cleaveth to it, as he that cauſeth a lame horſe to goe, is the cauſe of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but not of his lame going. And therefore it followeth not from their opinion that God is the Authour of ſinne. Firſt, all ſinnes receive not this diſtinction, becauſe of many ſins, the acts themſelves are ſinfull; as of the eating of the forbidden fruit, and <hi>Saul's</hi> ſparing of <hi>Agag,</hi> and the fat beaſts of the <hi>Amalekites.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, It is not true that they make the decree of God only of actions, &amp; not of their aberrations. For they make it to be the cauſe of all thoſe meanes that lead to damnation and therefore of ſinfull actions, as ſinfull, and not as bare actions. For actions deſerve damnation, not as actions but as trangreſſions of Gods law. 3. To this ſimile I ſay that the Rider or Maſter that ſhall reſolve firſt to flea his horſe, or knock him on the head, and then to make him lame, that for his halting, he may kill him, is undoubtedly the cauſe of his hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: And ſo God if he determine to caſt men into hell, and then to bring them into a ſtate of ſinne, that for their ſinnes he may bring them to ruine, we cannot conceive him to be leſſe then the Authour, as well of their ſins, as of thoſe actions to which they doe inſeperably adhere, and that out of Gods intention to deſtroy them.</q>

A man's hand is ſometimes inordinate, as being monſtrous, either having too much, or too little; as either wanting five fingers, or having more then five: what therefore ſhall it not be lawfull for us to diſtinguiſh between the hand and the monſtroſity of the hand?</hi> 2. <hi>The wall it ſelfe is white; what therefore ſhall we not diſtinguiſh between the wall, and the white co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of it?

                        <p n="2">2. Obſerve his ſhifting carriage. It is our Tenet that <hi>God is the Authour of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelfe, but not of the obliquity:</hi> and himſelfe hath expreſly acknowledged this to be our tenet in the beginning of this Section Now whereas he makes ſhew here of proving that we make God the Authour not of the action only, but of the obliquity alſo, he performes no ſuch matter; but only this, that we make the object of God's decree, not the action on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the aberration alſo; but in all this there is no contradiction unto us; We willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant that in as much as God permits ſinne, he will have ſinne come to paſſe, by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, every good thing that comes to paſſe, he will have it come to paſſe by his being the Authour of it and effecting it; the evill that comes to paſſe, he will have come to paſſe alſo, not by his being the Authour of it and effecting it, but only by his permitting of it. So that ſtill that of <hi>Auſtin</hi> holds good. <hi>Non aliquid fit niſi omnipotens fieri velit. Not any thing comes to paſſe unleſſe God will have it come to paſſe.</hi> And according to the eleaventh article of religion eſtabliſhed in the Church of Ireland, <hi>God from all eternity did by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable counſell ordaine whatſoever in time ſhall come to paſſe;</hi> and according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe word of God teſtifiing that the tenne Kings in giving their Kingdomes did here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doe the will of God.

Pontius Pilate, the Gentiles and people of Iſrael</hi> were <hi>by the hand and counſell of God before determined to be done</hi> We ſay ſinfull courſes (not hand over head) but unrepented of, lead unto damnation, but not as meanes. For they are neither man's meanes; for if they were, then the end alſo whereunto they tend, ſhould be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by him; Neither are they any meanes of God: For all meanes are the workes of him that intends the end; So is not the ſinne of man the worke of God, but the permiſſion of ſinne is his worke: And this is the meanes which he intends thereby to bring to paſſe his intended end, which yet on the part of Reprobates is not the damnation of them, but the manifeſtation of his glory in the way of vindicative juſtice, which in Scripture phraſe is called the Declaration of his wrath. For <hi>God made all things for himſelfe, even the wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of evill.</hi> And to this end he doth not only permit them both to ſinne, and to <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ro.</hi> 9. 23. <hi>Prov:</hi> 16. 4.</note> perſevere therein without repentance, but alſo to damne them for their ſinne. And this worke of God namely the permiſſion of ſinne is as requiſite for the manifeſtation of his mercy on the part of his Elect, as for the <hi>Declaration of his wrath,</hi> on the part of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates. Yet who was ever found ſo abſurd as to ſay that we make the ſinfull actions of men to be the meanes which God uſeth to bring about the ſalvation of his Elect. So little cauſe have we to make uſe of this diſtinction as the action it ſelfe and the ſinfullneſſe thereof, to ſhew in what ſenſe it is a meanes which God uſeth whereby to bring about the damnation of man. For we utterly deny ſinne to be any ſuch meanes of God, but the permiſſion thereof only is the meanes whereby to bring about not their damnation, as this Authour ſuggeſteth, but the meanes (together with the damnation for ſinne) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he bringeth to paſſe the declaration of his juſt wrath. But men of this Authours ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; unleſſe they be ſuffered to calumniate at pleaſure; and corrupt their oppoſites Tenet at pleaſure, they can ſay juſt nothing. It is true actions deſerve damnation only as they <hi>are tranſgreſſions of God's law,</hi> but we deny that theſe tranſgreſſions are God's meanes, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the permiſſion of them is his meanes; and by permitting theſe tranſgreſſions, as alſo by damning for them, he brings to paſſe his glorious end, to wit, the declaration of his juſt wrath. 3ly, It is moſt untrue that God brings any man into a ſtate of ſinne; He brings himſelfe into it moſt freely, God having no other hand in the ſinne but as permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, that is as not preſerving from it. Indeed if he did bring men into ſinne, and they not rather bring themſelves thereinto, he were the Authour of it. But it is well knowne that ſinne cannot tranſcend the region of acts naturall. All acts ſupernaturall muſt needs be the worke of grace, and truly good; But every ſinfull act is merely naturall, never ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall. Now never any of our Divines denyed a man liberty in his greateſt corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unto acts naturall; the Devill himſelfe hath liberty thus farre. It is true originall ſinne is brought upon all by the ſinne of <hi>Adam;</hi> For hereby the fountaine of humane nature became corrupted; but in this very ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> we had an hand, if there be any truth in Scripture
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56120:214"/>
which teſtifies that, <hi>In Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we all have ſinned.</hi> This is the doctrin which the Author ſpights, though he be more wiſe then to publiſh to the world his ſpleen againſt it: And I have <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ro.</hi> 5. 12.</note> ſeen under his hand where he denies originall ſinne to be <hi>veri nominis pecatum, ſinne tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called</hi> And albeit <hi>M.

As for all other ſins which we call actuall, they are, as I ſaid, naturall only, and not ſupernaturall; and therefore no man wants liberty, as to doe them, ſo to abſtaine from them; Only he wants a morall and Spirituall liberty to abſtaine from them in a gracious manner, according to that of <hi>Aquinas. Licet aliquis non poſſit gratiam adipiſci qui repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur à Deo, tamen quod in hoc peccatum vel illud labatur, ex ejus libero arbitrio contingit.</hi>

So <hi>Abſalom</hi> did as freely defile his Fathers Concubines. Then againe we deny that the damnation of any man is the end that God intends, but the manifeſtation of his own glory. And therfore though he hath made <hi>the wicked againſt the day of evill;</hi> yet both that, and all things he hath <hi>made for himſelfe.</hi> And to this tends both the permiſſion of ſinne, and the damnation of Reprobates for their <note place="margin">

And if permiſſion of ſinne were firſt in intention with God, and then damnation as theſe men would have it, it followeth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently by the moſt generally received rules of Schooles that permiſſion of ſinne ſhould be laſt in execution, that is men ſhould firſt be damned, and afterwards permitted to fall into ſinne.

                        <q>The will is determined to an Object two waies. 1. By compulſion againſt the bent and inclination of <note place="margin">
                              <hi>M. Maſon's Addit. p.</hi> 35. 36.</note> it. 2. By neceſſity according to the naturall deſire and liking of it. God's predeſtination ſay they, de termineth the will to ſinne this laſt way, but not the firſt; It forceth no man to doe that which he would not, but carrieth him towards that which he would. When men ſin, tis true they cannot chooſe; And it is as true, they will not chooſe. It followeth not therefore from the grounds of their doctrine that God's decree is the cauſe of men's ſins, but their own wicked wills.</q>
                        <p n="1">1. The Ancients made no diſtinction between theſe two words <hi>(Neceſſity)</hi> and <hi>(Compulſion)</hi> but u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them in this argument promiſcuouſly; and did deny that God did neceſſitate men to ſinne, leaſt they ſhould grant him hereby to be the Authour of ſin, as I have touched before, and ſhall intimate againe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Nor did the School men put any difference between them, as may appeare by the teſtimony of <hi>M. Calvin,</hi> who ſpeaking of the School-diſtinction of the will's threefold liberty; from neceſſity, from ſin, from Miſery, ſaith, This diſtinction I could willingly receive, but that it confoundeth neceſſitie with coaction.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That which neceſſitateth the will to ſinne is as truly the cauſe of ſinne, as that which forceth it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it maketh the ſinne to be inevitably committed, which otherwiſe might be avoided; and therefore if the Divine decree neceſſitate man's will to ſinne, it is as truly the cauſe of ſinne as if it did inforce it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That which neceſſitates the will to ſinne, is more truly the cauſe of the ſinne, then the will is; becauſe it overruleth the will, and beareth all the ſtroke, taketh from it, 'its true liberty, by which it ſhould be Lord of it ſelfe, and diſporſer of 'its own acts, and in reſpect of which it hath been uſually called by Philoſophers and Fathers too, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>a power which is under the inſuperable check and controule of no Lord but it ſelfe.</hi> It overruleth, I ſay, &amp; maketh it become but a ſervile inſtrument, irreſiſtably ſubject to ſuperiour command and determination; And therefore is a truer cauſe of all ſuch acts and ſins, as proceed from the will ſo determined, then the will is. For when two Cauſes concurre to the producing of an effect, the one a principle overruling cauſe, the other but inſtrumentall, and wholly at the Devotion of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall; then is the effect in all reaſon to be imputed to the principall, which by the force of 'its influxe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion produceth it, rather then to the ſubordinate and inſtrumentall which is but a mere ſervant in the production of it We ſhall find it ordinary in Scripture to aſcribe the effect to the principall Agent. It is not ye that ſpeak, ſaith Chriſt, but the Spirit of my Father that ſpeaketh in you. I laboured more abundantly then <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat:</hi> 10. 20. 1 <hi>Co:</hi> 15. 10.</note> they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was in me. And I live: yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me ſaith St. <hi>Paul. Gal:</hi> 2. 20. In theſe and many other places the effect or work ſpoken of, is taken from the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56120:215" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and given to the principall agent; Which being ſo, though man's will worke with God's decree in the commiſſion of ſinne, and willeth the ſin which it doth, yet ſeing what the will doth, it doth by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power of God's Allmighty decree, and ſo it doth that otherwiſe it cannot doe; the ſin committed cannot ſo rightly be aſcribed to man's will, the inferiour as to God's neceſſitating decree the ſuperiour cauſe.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That which makes a man ſinne by way of neceſſitie, that is with, and not againſt his will, is the cauſe of ſin in a worſe manner, then that which conſtraineth him to ſinne againſt his will; As he which by power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full perſwaſions drawes a man to ſtab, to hang, to poiſon himſelfe is in a groſſer manner the cauſe of that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and unnaturall action then he that by force compells him; becauſe he maketh him to conſent to his own death; And ſo if Gods decree doe not only make men ſin; but ſin willingly too; not only cauſe that they ſhall <hi>(malè agere) doe evill;</hi> but <hi>(malè velle) will evill,</hi> it hath the deeper hand in the ſinne.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>God determines the will to ſinne by neceſſitie, though not by compulſion:</hi> this he obtrudes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Devines as their opinion, but quotes none, is it likely that he who quotes <hi>Beza</hi> to <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> ſhew that in his opinion, God doth not only permit ſinne, but will ſinne; And <hi>Calvin</hi> to ſhew, that a man's mind is blinded, <hi>volente &amp; jubente Deo;</hi> would not quote ſome or other of our Divines to prove that which he obtrudes upon them? If his common place booke could afford him any ſuch quotation out of any one of them, to ſhew who they be, and where they ſay that, <hi>God determines the will to ſinne by neceſſity though not by compulſion.</hi> Was there ever the like crimination made againſt any without naming them that ſay ſo, and the place where, and their own words? Or hath this man or any of his ſpirit deſerved any credit to be truſted this way? The very phraſe of determining in Latine is no word of courſe with our Divines in this argument.

And <hi>Calvin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this contradiction might well blame them that confound neceſſity, with coact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; whereby a way is opened to conclude, that becauſe a man is free from conſtraint of ſinning, therefore he is free from neceſſity of ſinning; whereas originall ſin doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily incline him to ſinfull actions &amp; courſes in generall; though to this kind of ſin in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or to this particular, in what kindſoever, it doth not: yet by the way it is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that <hi>Calvin</hi> in ſome particulars, as namely in gracious courſes, did attribute ſo much to the efficacy of God's operation upon a man's will, as that the actions performed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by though voluntary, yet in his opinion were not to be accounted free; &amp; indeed they are wrought in oppoſition &amp; as it were in ſpight of a certain principall of corruption that in part remaines in the very beſt of God's children. But we ſee no reaſon to the contrary, but that, when once God hath planted in us a principle of new life, of the life of grace, by the ſpirit of regeneration, though all the powers thereof doe incline only to that which is good, like as the powers of naturall corruption incline only unto evill, yet the particu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lar uſe and exerciſe of thoſe is alwaies free: Like as the particular uſe and exerciſe of the powers of our corruption is allwaies free to the committing of this or that ſinne accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto emergent occaſions ſtanding in congruity to every man's particular diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

3. In the ſame language he proſecutes his vile cauſe, giving manifeſt evidence to the world that it cannot be ſupported without lyes, nor embraced by any but thoſe whom God in his ſecret judgments hath given over to ſtrong illuſions to believe lyes, It is not incredible to me that ever any Papiſt or Proteſtant hath affirmed that God neceſſitates the will to ſinne; They generally acknowledge that evill hath no cauſe efficient, but defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient only: The terme of God's operation is no other then the ſubſtance of the act, which as an entity, and as an act muſt neceſſarily proceed from God, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath delivered. And albeit they maintaine that God's concurrence to the producing of the act doth worke upon the will of the creature which, from the firſt time that Divines came reſolutely unto the acknowledgment of this Divine concourſe to the act of ſin, hath alſo been received as I have ſhewed in my <hi>Vinaiciae.</hi> For <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> diſputing on either ſide about this concurrence, leaves it indifferent to the Reader to imbrace either part: Either the affirmative that God doth concurre to every act, though it be ſinfull or the negative. Yet I ſay as many as doe maintaine the affirmative, doe ſo maintaine God's motion upon the creatures will, as to move it only agreably unto it's nature, namely to work freely not neceſſarily. Like as he moves neceſſary Agents to work neceſſarily, and contingent Agents to worke contingently. And if this Authour be ignorant hereof, which may well give him boldnes. For who ſo bold as blind Bayard? What doth he other in all this but betray his own ſhame comming to diſcourſe on ſuch an argument, as an aſſe comes to play upon an harp, as the proverbe ſpeaks. But if he be not ignorant of this, what unſhamefaſtneſſe doth he manifeſt all along, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king bold only upon the ſimplicity and ignorance of his Reader to gull him, and abuſe him, and draw him along to oppoſe the free grace of God in predeſtination and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, under colour of making God the Authour of ſinne in the point of reprobation; which yet he deſpaires of making good againſt us without notorious untruths, and that undoubtedly delivered againſt his own knowledge. For what Authour hath he produced to juſtifie this that any of our Divines maintaines that God neceſſitates the will of man to ſin? Not any that I know uſing this phraſe <hi>Neceſſitate</hi> but Papiſts, and among'ſt them none that I know but <hi>Bradwardine</hi> a man renowned in his time both for eminent lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and eminent piety, as appeares by Sir <hi>Henry Savill's</hi> preface unto that book of his; and he no where affirming that God neceſſitates any man unto ſinne; but only to the ſubſtance of the act; &amp; that not ſo as to make the will work neceſſarily, as the phraſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports in a vulgar eare, and unto a popular judgment (whereupon alone this Author takes his advantage moſt unconſcionably) but agreably to 'its nature, that is contingently and freely. For were he able to produce any one of our Divines that affirmeth this, why doth he not? Is there any<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>hing throughout this whole diſcourſe that more requires he ſhould name the man, and quote the places, where this is affirmed, then this? Yet here we find a blank; he carrieth it on magnificently upon his own bare word, which deſerves no credit at our hands; And is it poſſible to believe ſo foule a crimination without all evidence produced, unleſſe faction and partiallity hath blinded his eyes? Should he have laied to our charge that we maintaine that God neceſſitates the will to any good act, and to overrule the will therein, we ſhould utterly deny it without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction. It is true he overrules the will of the fleſh, but not the will of the Spirit, the regenerate part, but moves it agreably to 'its nature, and to worke not only voluntarily but freely whatſoever it worketh. For albeit the regenerate part is like a morall vertue (though as much tranſcendent to it, as a thing ſupernaturall tranſcends a thing naturall) inclining only to that which is good; yet is it alwaies moved to this particular good rather then unto an other moſt freely. Like as a man's naturall corruption inclines a man only to evill; yet to this kind of evill or to this particular evill, rather then to that, Man is moved moſt freely. So that if we maintaine not that God workes a man to every good act, otherwiſe then freely; let the very conſcience of our enemies judge, whether we can maintaine that God neceſſitates the will either of men or of Devills unto ſinne. For it is apparent that God hath a Double influence unto a good act. One unto it as unto an act, and that is influence generall; Another unto it as unto a good and gracious act, and that we acknowledge to be an influence ſpeciall and ſupernaturall. But as touching an evill act, all ſides confeſſe that God hath but a ſingle influence thereunto and that generall, namely, as it is an act, not as it is evill. And albeit this influence which we call concurrence unto the act, be joyned with an influence into the will of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to move it to the producing of the ſame act; yet this motion is no other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whereby
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56120:216"/>
the will is moved to worke agreably to 'its nature; that is freely. Like as all other Agents are moved by God, the firſt Agents to worke agreably to their natures, neceſſary things to worke neceſſarily, contingent things contingently. So that in all this there is no overruling of the will, no liberty taken from her; but rather ſhe is maintained and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in her free condition, and moved agreably thereunto; like as in the eleaventh Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Ireland it is expreſſed. For after it is laid downe that, <hi>God from all eternity did by his unchangable counſell ordaine whatſoever in time ſhould come to paſſe;</hi> It is forthwith added that, <hi>hereby no violence us offered to the wills of the reaſonable creatures, and neither the liberty nor the contingency of the ſecond cauſes is taken away but eſtabliſhed rather.</hi> But becauſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother claw that here is ſubjoyned by this Authour, it is to be conſidered that the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the creature is not equall unto the liberty of the Creator God himſelfe: But like as all other cauſes are but ſecond cauſes, God alone the prime cauſe; All other Agents but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Agents, God alone the firſt Agent. So likewiſe all other free Agents are but ſecond free Agents, God alone <hi>primum liberum, the firſt free Agent.</hi> So that no liberty of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth or can exempt it from the Agency of God, <hi>In whom we live and move and have our being</hi> what a proud thing &amp; preſumptuous were it for the creature to aſpire unto ſuch an exemption. Who oppoſe us in the point of free will more then Papiſts? Yet ſee how <hi>Alvarez</hi> diſputes againſt this viſe and preſumptuous conceit, ſo much maintained by the Jeſuites, and after taken up by the Arminians, who live by their ſcraps, as if they would be content to waſh their diſhes.

This concluſion is held of all thoſe Divines who maintaine that God by his motion or effectuall grace, not only morally, but efficiently and phyſically doth cauſe us to worke that which is good, &amp; it is proved,</hi> ſaith he <hi>by all thoſe reaſons whereby it hath been formery ſhewed that God by his decree &amp; effectuall motion doth predetermine all ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, even ſuch as are free, to worke, preſerving their liberty and nature</hi> 3. <hi>The dominion of her act is not firſt in the power of free will created, but in the power and dominion of God, eſpecially in reſpect of acts ſupernaturall Our meaning is that all dominion &amp; actuall uſe of dominion which the created will hath as cauſa proxima the next cauſe, or doth exerciſe over her free acts which ſhe produceth, proceedeth from God, as from the cheifeſt &amp; firſt cauſe efficient, &amp; ought to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into him as into the firſt Authour &amp; firſt abſolute Lord thereof</hi> And the truth is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of free will, is commonly confounded though there is place of momentous diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. For as for free will unto good that is merely Morall, and the reſolution thereof, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the reſolution in the point of originall ſinne. But free will unto actions in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall under an appearance of good, this is naturall liberty; and the reſolution thereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon a right underſtanding of God's naturall providence in governing the world, and working with all creatures in their ſeverall kinds, ſuch operations as are agreable to their ſeverall conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The firſt liberty conſiſts in diſpoſing man aright towards his end; like as morall vertues tend to this. But the ſecond liberty conſiſt's only in the right uſe of the meanes, unto what end ſoever is projected by us. The appearance of good moving herein is only, <hi>in genere boni conducentis, in the kind of good conducing to the end propounded;</hi> whether that end can be good or evill, right or wrong. But the appearence of good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the former is only, <hi>ſummiboni, of our cheifeſt good,</hi> the enjoying whereof will make us happy. But to returne, this Authour with whom I deale in preſent, ſtands for the will of man's abſolute dominion over her acts; as before he did expreſſe; whereas <hi>Alvarez</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth utterly againſt this, Neither doe I blame him for contradicting <hi>Alvarez</hi> in this; but for carrying himſelfe like a poſitive <hi>Theologue,</hi> nor ſo only, but like a peremptory <hi>Theologue</hi> contenting himſelfe to dictate rules to others without all proofe, ſave this that otherwiſe we make God the Authour of ſinne. Yet this is not any expreſſe Argument of his neither; but he obtrudes premiſe, upon us, which I thinke was never affirmed by any Divines of theſe dayes, unleſſe it be by ſome Libertines, againſt whom none that I know have diſputed more effectually then ſome of thoſe very Divines which here are traduced

by him. But obſerve the vile and abominable iſſue of this Authours doctrine in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, making man as he is a free creature to be the Lord of his own free act; yea and to have the abſolute dominion thereof, as formerly he did expeſſe <hi>Sect:</hi> 3. For ſeing the act of faith, of repentance, and the like are free acts; if liberty cannot be maintained unleſſe a man hath the abſolute dominion of his own act, hence it manifeſtly followeth, that God doth not determine the will to believe, to repent, or to any good work, yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture profeſſeth that <hi>God is he, who makes us perfect unto every good worke, working in us that which is pleaſing in his ſight through Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> That it is <hi>God who worketh in us both the</hi>

                           <hi>will and the deed according to his good pleaſure.</hi> So that if a man ſhould live <hi>Methuſalch</hi> his age, and ſpend that whole time in a gracious converſation; yet that God doth worke in him either the will or the deed of one gracious act more, it is merely of his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; ſo little cauſe have we to preſume of perſeverance in that which is good by out own ſtrength. And againe all this God workes in us for Chriſt his ſake. Chriſt hath deſerved even this at the hands of God his father. What then is the meaning of this, that God ſhould cooperate with us to the will and the deed, provided that we will? Conſider the abſurdity of this (upon the ſuppoſall of the poſſibility of ſuch a cooperation, which yet by evident reaſon may be demonſtrated to be utterly impoſſible.) Did Chriſt merit any thing for the Angells? yet doth he not cooperate with them to every act of theirs as well as to any of ours? Nay is it poſſible that any act ſhould exiſt without God's operation? And is it reaſonable to ſubject ſuch a courſe of Divine providence to the merits of Chriſt? Thus we ſee whereunto this Authour tends in this diſcourſe of his, namely ſo to maintaine God to be no Authour of ſinne, as withall to maintaine that he is no Authour of that which is good, no not of faith, repentance, or any gracious act that is freely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by any creature man or Angell: we on the other ſide deſire &amp; endeavour ſo to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry our ſelves that while we vindicate God from being the Authour of evill, we may not therewithall deny him to be the Authour of any thing, that is good and gracious; which is this Authours courſe, as appeares manifeſtly in the iſſue. And obſerve his crafty ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage foxe like; Had he dealt upon predeſtination, and the efficacy of grace, and therein profeſſed plainly that faith and repentance being free acts, every man's will hath an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute dominion over them; and therefore God doth not determine the will thereunto: For that were to make God the Authour of faith and repentance; how many thouſands would have been ready to have flowen in his face, and abhorre ſuch abominable doctrine. Therefore he baulks that, and deales only upon reprobation; and here he layeth to our charge that we make God the Authour of ſinne, by neceſſitating and determining the will to ſinne (though his premiſes herein I have ſhewen to be moſt falſe) therefore he maintains that God doth not determine the will ſo much as to the act whereunto the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe accrewes; both becauſe man's will is free; and becauſe ſo he ſhould be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of ſinne. And if once he can make his Reader to ſwallow this, he doubts not but to take him in the point of predeſtination and grace alſo; and make him wary to take heed of maintaining that God determines or neceſſitates the will of man to any good act whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of faith or of repentance, and that for feare of denying man to have the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute dominion over his will, to worke himſelfe to faith and repentance at his pleaſure: and ſecondly, for feare of makeing God the Authour of faith and repentance and every good act; Like as by ſaying that God doth determine or neceſſitate the will to ſinne, we make him the Authour of ſinne. Behold Reader the iſſue of this man's Divinity; and whether he be not leading thee into the very chambers of death, by working thee with him to oppoſe the free grace of God, both in predeſtination and in regeneration, and the power and efficacy therereof in working thee to faith, to repentance, and to every thing that is pleaſing and acceptable unto him, &amp; that through Jeſus Chriſt. Yet we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a manifeſt difference between God's moving the creature unto that which is good, and moving the creature unto ſuch acts as are evill. For in evill be moves only to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the act, whereof our Adverſaries themſelves acknowledge God to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, that is the efficient cauſe, and this he performes by influence generall. But as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every good act, the Lord moveth not only to the ſubſtance of the act by influence generall, but alſo to the goodnes thereof by influence ſpeciall. He proceeds to tell us what Philoſophers teach concerning the condition of the will. And becauſe it is very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd for a Chriſtian to goe to ſchoole to Philoſophers to learne the condition of Divine providence; he tels us of Fathers too that maintaine the ſame as he ſaith, but he quotes neither the one, nor the other. Now I would gladly know what Father hath ever taught that God hath no power over the will of man to convert it, and <hi>ex nolentibus volentes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi>
                           <pb n="107" facs="tcp:56120:217" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <hi>of unwilling, to make men willing,</hi> to worke men to faith, to repentance, to all kind of pious obedience. And as for God's ſecret providence in evill, how plentifull is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concerning this? <hi>God is ſaid to have ſent Ioſeph into Egypt,</hi> though this was brought to paſſe by the parricidiall hands of his brethren; To tell <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>the ſword ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from his houſe,</hi> though this could not be taken up or uſed, but by the free will of men; To ſend <hi>Senacherib</hi> againſt a diſſembling nation; and to profeſſe that this proud King in all his bloudy executions upon the people of God, was but as the axe, or the ſawe in the hand of God. The like is teſtified concerning <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> after him. Nay the Prophet demands, <hi>Whether there be any evill in the Citty and the Lord hath not done it;</hi> ſpeaking of the evill of puniſhment, though wickedly executed by the hands of wicked men; that the <hi>Lord cauſed the King of Aſſur to fall by the ſword in his own land,</hi> though this was done by the hands of his own children. And as in violent courſes, ſo in impure courſes the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as plainly teſtifies the ſecret providence of God to have place therein. And what doth <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerve from the like places both in his fift book againſt <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Pelag: c:</hi> 3, and in his book <hi>de gratia &amp; libero arbitrio,</hi> profeſſing, <hi>occulto Dei judicio fieri perverſitatem cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, that the perverſity of the heart,</hi> or will, <hi>comes to paſſe by the ſecret judgment of God;</hi> And the power that God hath over the wills of men <hi>to incline them even to evill;</hi> that is his phraſe as I have formerly ſhewed, abundantly repreſenting the places where he delivers this. He proceeds not ſo much in Scholaſticall diſcourſe, as in rhetoricall amplification, more like a Shrew vexing him ſelfe and fretting that he cannot have his will, then like a diſputer. <hi>That which neceſſitates the will makes it become but a ſervile inſtrument, irreſiſtably ſubject to ſuperiour command and determination;</hi> this action of command comes in moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably, it denoting a morall action, commanding not only things agreable, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times contrary to the will of the perſon commanded. No ſuch thing hath place in <hi>God's moving of the will of man</hi> (did he move it unto ſinne which yet is moſt falſe; for he moves it only to the ſubſtance of the act.) But why ſhould it ſeeme ſtrange that the creature ſhould be a Servant to the Creator, and his inſtrument, and a ſervile inſtrument. Yet the notion of ſervility is very aliene from the matter in hand, that having place only in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpeech as touching morall obedience; that which we treat of, is rather of motions na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and of the ſubordination of the ſecond cauſe to the firſt, the ſecond Agent to the firſt. And was ever any ſober man known to oppoſe this with ſuch froth of words as this Authour doth? Doth this Authour himſelfe thinke it poſſible that the Creature can move it ſelfe, or performe any operation without God's concourſe? I doe not think he doth. Doe we not live in God, have we not our being in God? And what is this other then to ſay that our life and being depend on God, in the kind of a cauſe efficient? And doth not the ſame Apoſtle, and in the ſame place teſtifie, and that in the words of an heathen man (to ſhew that all ſuch did not ſo maintaine the <gap reason="foreign">

And the truth is all the queſtion is about the manner of this concourſe divine; whereabouts this Authour ſpends not a word, as if he kept his breath for ſome other purpoſe then to deale on that point, which alone is controverted. The ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable ſubjection he ſpeaks of is no more then the bereaving of the will of her liberty, which is moſt untrue For proof whereof I appeale to every man that will but look upon <hi>Alvarez,</hi> that maintaines this divine motion of will under the notion of determining; And upon <hi>Bradwardine,</hi> who alone, that I know maintaines the ſame divine motion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of neceſſitating: Whereas he infers herehence that <hi>God is a truer cauſe of all ſuch acts and ſins that proceed from the will ſo determined, then the will is.</hi> Oftentimes he hath ſet before us ſuch Coleworts; but we have nothing but his bare word for it. And it depends merely upon this that the action of the creature is not free. Whereas both <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardin</hi> maintaines that God neceſſitates the creature to every free act of his; And <hi>Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi> that God determines the creature to worke freely. Now is it a ſober courſe hence to inferre, that the act is not free? As much as to ſay it cannot but be free, therfore it is not free. And yet we know that every one naturally is prone to ſinne, and in the beſt of God's children there is a principle that inclines to ſinne. God is confeſſed by our very oppoſites to be the true cauſe of the act; yet not at all the cauſe of the ſin by his concourſe. Only they differ from us as touching the nature of this concourſe; We ſay God concurres to the producing of the act as it becomes not an Agent only, but the firſt Agent; not a cauſe only, but the firſt cauſe; and man as a ſecond Agent, and ſecond cauſe that moveth in God as the Apoſtle teſtifies; like as he lives in God, and hath his being in God. But theſe men deviſe God, and man to move to the producing of the ſame act, as two men in lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56120:218" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a timber logge, moſt indecently: And to free this concurrence from chance, they ſay ſometimes that God workes this or that act in us <hi>modo velimus,</hi> that is, <hi>upon condition that we will</hi> But when they conſider that God workes the act of willing, as well as ought elſe; &amp; are demanded to anſwer upon what condition he workes this what condition will they deviſe of this? will he ſay; <hi>modo velimus, provided that we will?</hi> As much as to ſay, God will produce the act of willing, provided that it be produced already by us. Others ſay that God foreſeeing that the will of man, at ſuch a time will produce ſuch an act of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in caſe God be pleaſed to concurre to the producing of it, hereupon he reſolves to concurre to the producing of it, whereby the finall reſolution is rather into the will of God, then into the will of the creature, I ſay the finall reſolution of every ſinfull act com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the creature. Secondly here is deviſed a thing future without all ground. For whereas the act of willing (as for example in <hi>Iudas,</hi> the act of willing to betray his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, is it in 'its own nature merely poſſible not future how then did it paſſe into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a thing future and that from everlaſting (For from everlaſting God knew it as a thing future) this could not be done without a cauſe? And what cauſe could there be of an eternall effect, but an eternall cauſe which is God alone: And in God nothing can be deviſed to be the cauſe thereof, but his will or decree. Therefore to avoid this they muſt be driven to conclude that all future things became future by neceſſitie of nature; if not of their own nature; yet at leaſt by the neceſſitie of God's nature, he producing them all not freely, but by neceſſitie of nature This is that Atheiſticall neceſſitie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon our Adverſaries are caſt, while they oppoſe ſuch a neceſſitie as depends upon God's decree ordaining all things to come to paſſe agreably to their natures, neceſſary things neceſſarily, contingent things contingently and accordingly ordaining neceſſary cauſes working neceſſarily, for the producing of the one; and contingent cauſes working con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingently, for the producing of the other; as <hi>Aquinas</hi> diſcourſeth. 1. <hi>pag q.</hi> 19, in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle whoſe title is this, <hi>Utrum divina voluntas neceſſitatem rebus imponat, whether the will of God impoſeth a neceſſitie on things that come to paſſe in the world?</hi> The reaſon this Authour brings is a mere Socyſme, ſaying the ſame over and over againe; As when he ſaith, <hi>For when two cauſes concurre to the producing of an effect; the one principall overruling cauſe, the other but an inſtrumentall &amp; wholly at the devotion of the principall, then is the effect in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be imputed to the principall, which by the force of 'its influxe and impreſſion produceth it, rather then to the ſubordinate and inſtrumentall, which is but a mere ſervant in the production of it.</hi> To which I anſwer, that which he calls overruling, I have often ſhewed how abſurdly it is imputed unto us. For how can that be called overruling which workes not the will contrary to 'its nature, but moves it only agreably to the nature thereof. As for the cauſe principall, what Scholar of any braines ever denyed God to be the cauſe principall in any action to the producing whereof he concurres? For is he not the firſt cauſe and the firſt Agent? Are not all other ſecond cauſes and ſecond Agents? But this Authour hopes his Reader will underſtand this in reference only to the ſinne, not to the naturall act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, whereas God as touching the ſinfullneſſe of it is no Agent at all, much leſſe a prime Agent; no cauſe at all, much leſſe a prime cauſe. Then ſecondly let God never ſo effectually work any creature to the producing of an act connaturall thereunto, yet if he works the creature therunto agreably to its nature, that is if it be an neceſſary Agent, moues it to worke neceſſarily, if it be a contingent agent, moves it to worke contingently; if it be a free agent, moves it to worke freely; then by <hi>Arminius</hi> his confeſion our cauſe is gained. For God ſhall be found free from blame, and the creature void of excuſe. Now this is clearly our doctrine, and in effect the doctrine of all them, who ſay that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the will, as the <hi>Dominicans;</hi> or that God neceſſitates the will, as <hi>Bradwardine.</hi> For they all acknowledge hereby that God moves the creature to worke freely, in ſuch ſort that in the very act of working they might doe otherwiſe if they would. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe this providence of God is a great myſtery and not ſufficiently comprehenſible by humane reaſon. <hi>Cajetan</hi> profeſſeth thus much as before alleadged, and <hi>Alvarez</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines it in a ſet diſputation; And ſuppoſing God's concourſe as neceſſarily required to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very act of the creature, they are able to prove by evident demonſtration, that no other concourſe can be admitted, then this whereby God moves every creature and that effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to every act thereof, but agreably to 'its nature and condition. And this is farther demonſtrated by God's fore knowledge, of things future. Another <hi>Arminian</hi> with whom I have had to deale in this argument, being preſſed with this reaſon drawen from God's foreknowledge and urged to ſhew how things poſſible became future &amp; that from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting (for from everlaſting they were known to God as future) had no way to helpe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56120:218" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſelfe but by flying to the actuall exiſtence of all things in eternity. And I have good ground for ſtrong preſumption that this Authour with whom now I deale had his hand in that Pye, which was above foure yeares agoe. See the deſperate iſſue of theſe mens diſcourſes; who are drawen to take hold of ſuch a Tenet to helpe themſelves withall; which their beſt freinds the Jeſuites, the Authours of <hi>Scientia media,</hi> doe utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime. And on the other ſide the <hi>Dominicans</hi> who embrace the actuall exiſtence of all things in eternity, are utterly repugnant to the doctrine of <hi>Scientia media.</hi> So that when the Jeſuites are reconciled to the <hi>Dominicans</hi> in the point of actuall exiſtence of all things in eternity; And the <hi>Dominicans</hi> to the Jeſuites in the point of <hi>Scientia media,</hi> then theſe men with whom I deale are like to prevaile, which I doubt will hardly be before <hi>Elias comes.</hi> Thirdly conſider, if when one cauſe is principall, overruling the other, the effect muſt be imputed rather to the principall then to the other. It followes evidently that when the cauſes doe equally concurre without any ſuch overruling of one the other, then the effect is equally imputable unto each, &amp; conſequently the ſin (For ſuch is this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour's language in this Argument) is equally imputable to both, to God as well as man; And he is to be accounted the Author of it, as well as man. I appeale to every man's ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber conſcience that is able to judge indifferently between us in this. But if to avoid this they deny that the concurrence is equall, but that God's concurrence is conditionall, to wit, in caſe the creature will, and ſo man is to be accounted the Authour of ſinne, and not God, hence it followeth, that ſeeing God's concurrence unto the act of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is of the ſame nature in the opinion of theſe men; God is not the Authour of faith and repentance any more, then he is the Authour of ſinne, in the language of theſe diſputers. Or if they fly not to this, as I have found this Authour (as I gueſſe) to deny God's concourſe to ſtand in ſubordination to man's, then my former argument is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided; But a third reaſon ariſeth herehence againſt his former diſcourſe of God's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, namely, that if God and man doe equally concurre unto the act of ſinne, then, as I have already ſhewed, that they are equally guilty of ſin. So in the working of faith and repentance man is as forward as God and as much the Authour of his own fatih and repentance as God is, in direct contradiction to the Apoſtle who ſaith that, <note place="margin">

The labour of <hi>Paul</hi> more abundantly then of all the reſt of the Apoſtles, was it not a free action in <hi>Paul?</hi>

                           </gap>f God determined the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> unto theſe actions, then freedome of will humane ſtands not in oppoſition to determination divine; and conſequently though the act be evill that is, done by man; yet may God determine the creature to the doing of that act, without any impeachment of the creatures liberty. If God did not determine the wills of his Servants but only afford a ſimultaneous concourſe to their actions, why is he called the cauſe principall, ſince it is confeſſed, God doth afford the like concourſe to every ſinfull act, as touching the ſubſtance thereof.</p>
                        <p>Againe he repeates the ſame, when in caſe of divine determination, he ſaith, <hi>the ſinne cannot be ſo rightly aſcribed to man's will the inferiour, as to God's neceſſitating decree, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour cauſe.</hi> To which I anſwer againe, being drawen thereunto by his <hi>Tautologies;</hi> by the ſame reaſon it may be inferred, that when the fire burnes any combuſtible thing, the burning is rather to be aſcribed to God the more principall cauſe, then to the fire the leſſe principall, the firſt cauſe being more principall then the ſecond and if it pleaſe God ſo to order it, the fire ſhall not burne as it appeares in the three noble children caſt into the furnace of Babylon, when they came forth there was not ſo much as the ſmell of fire upon them. Secondly I anſwer as before, by the ſame reaſon, when the concourſe unto the ſinfull act is equall on man's part, &amp; on God's, each ſhall equally be accounted the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of that ſinne, and not man more then God; Now ſuch a concourſe is maintained by this Authour. Thirdly in the working of faith and repentance; ſince by theſe mens
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56120:219"/>
opinions God affords only his concourſe he ſhall be no more the Authour of man's faith and repentance then man himſelfe is. Laſtly be it granted that God is a more principall cauſe then ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in producing the act; yet there is no colour of imputing unto God the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of the ſin, who hath no Agency therein, by doing what he ought not to doe, or not in that manner he ſhould doe, this is found only in the creature, who being a free Agent, otherwiſe then as originall ſinne hath impaired liberty, which I hope this Authour will not deny, is juſtly anſwerable for his own tranſgreſſion. As for example, God determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhould give the Jewes liberty to returne into their own land; yet this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was as free an action, as any that was performed by him throughout his life. God determined that <hi>Joſiah</hi> ſhould burne the Prophets bones upon the Altar at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> yet <hi>Ioſiah</hi> did this as freely as ought elſe: God determined that Chriſt's bones ſhould not be broken, yet the ſouldiours abſtained from the breaking of his bones with as much liberty as they had uſed, in caſe they had broken them. This divine providence we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly confeſſe is very myſterious, and as <hi>Cajetan</hi> ſaith the diſtinctions uſed to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date it to our capacitie doe not quiet the underſtanding; therefore he thought it his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to captivate his into the obedience of faith. And <hi>Alvarez</hi> in a ſolemne diſputation proves that it is incomprehenſible by the wit of man.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. His laſt is delivered moſt perplexedly. I can make no ſenſe of it as the words lie, but I ſee his meaning. He ſuppoſeth that God by our Tenet makes a man to ſin willingly, &amp; that he ſaith is worſe then to conſtraine a man to ſinne againſt his will. Where obſerve how this man's ſpirit is intoxicated when he delivered this. For firſt he calls that worſe which is merely impoſſible, and that by his own rules. For he holds that ſinne cannot be, except it be voluntary, ſpeaking of ſinne committed by any particular perſon. Secondly he ſuppoſeth that by our opinion God makes a man to ſinne, which is moſt untrue. For when he acknowledgeth that no ſin can be committed by man without God's concourſe; will he ſay that God by his concourſe helps a man to ſinne? He helps him to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the act, not to the committing of the ſinne. And indeed be the act never ſo ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, if it proceed not out of the love and feare of God, it is no better then ſuch as the Heathens performed; of which <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath profeſſed that they were no better then <hi>ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dida peccata glorious ſins:</hi> So that if God doth not give a man theſe graces of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in every act that is performed by him he ſhall ſinne, and not only in acts vitious; and God is not bound to beſtow theſe graces on any.</p>

And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is becauſe the evill of ſinne is greater then any good that can come by ſinne; foraſmuch as it is <hi>laeſio divinae majeſtatis, a wronging of God's majeſty;</hi> and to <hi>Divino bono oppoſita,</hi> directly prejudiciall to the good of Almighty God as much as any thing can be. This Saint <hi>Paul</hi> knew very well, and therefore he tells us plainely that we muſt not doe evill that good may come thereof. Whoſoever therefore willeth ſin, though for never ſo good an end, he willeth that which is truly and formally a ſinne, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently God, though he will ſinne for never ſo good ends, yet willing it with ſuch a powerfull, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all will, as giveth a neceſſary being to it, he becommeth Authour of that which is formally ſinne.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The members of this diſtinction are not oppoſite, for ſinne as ſinne, and in no other conſideration is meanes of puniſhment.

                           <p n="3">3 This diſtinction faſtneth upon God a further aſperſion, and loadeth him with three ſpeciall indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties more.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Want of wiſedome and providence. His counſells muſt needs be weak if he can find out no meanes to glorifie juſtice, but by the bringing in of ſinne, which his ſoule hateth, into the world and appointing men to commit it, that ſo he may maaifeſt juſtice in the puniſhment of it.</p>
                           <p n="2">2.

                              <pb n="111" facs="tcp:56120:219"/>
3. Want of mercy in an high degree, as if he did ſo delight in bloud, that rather then he will not deſtroy mens ſoules, he will have them live and dye in ſinne, that he may deſtroy them, like to thoſe Pagan Princes of whom <hi>Juſtin</hi> Martyr <hi>Apol:</hi> 2, two or three leaves from the beginning ſaith, They are afraid that all ſhould be juſt leaſt they ſhould have none to puniſh. But this is the diſpoſition of Hang-men rather then of Good Princes: And therefore farre be thoſe foule enormities, and in particular this latter from the God of truth and Father of mercies. And thus notwithſtanding theſe diſtinctions, it is in my conceit moſt evident that the rigid and upper way makes God the Authour of mens ſins, as well as puniſhment. And ſo much for the firſt generall inconvenience, which ariſeth from this opinion, namely the diſhonour of God.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>I willingly profeſſe I am to ſeeke what that Divine of ours is that ſaith God doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate men to ſinne, <hi>as a meanes of their puniſhment.</hi> Here this Authour is ſilent, names <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> no man, quotes no place; Like as in the former he carried himſelfe in this manner. The Ancients generally take predeſtination in no other notion, then to be of ſuch things which God himſelfe did purpoſe to bring to paſſe by his own operation, not of ſuch things as come to paſſe by God's permiſſion, Neither can I call to remembrance any Divine of ours that talkes of God's predeſtinating men unto ſinne. But the Scripture affords plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull teſtimony of God's will, ordination, and determination, that the ſins of men come to paſſe by God's permiſſion. Was it not God's will that <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> heart ſhould be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, ſo as not to let Iſrael goe for a while, when he told <hi>Moſes</hi> that he would harden <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> heart that he ſhould not let Iſrael goe? Was it not God's appointment that <hi>Abſolom</hi> ſhould lye with his fathers Concubines, when he denounced this judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, that he would give his wives unto his neighbour, who ſhould lye with them before the ſun? Was it not his will that the ten tribes ſhould revolt from <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> when he proteſted of that buſineſſe, that it was from him? Was it not God's will that the Jews and Gentiles ſhould concurre in crucifying Chriſt when the Apoſtles profeſſe, that <hi>both Herod &amp; Pontius-Pilate, with the Gentiles, and people of Iſrael were gathered together to doe what God's hand and counſell had before determined to be done?</hi> Doth not Saint <hi>Peter</hi> profeſſe of ſome that ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled at the word being diſobedient, that <hi>hereunto they were ordained?</hi> And <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Act:</hi> 4. 28. 1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Rev:</hi> 17. 17.</note> that the ten Kings in giving their Kingdomes to the beaſt did fullfill the will of God, as touching this particular? But that God ſhould will or ordaine it as a meanes of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as if the end which God aimed at, were the puniſhment, is ſo abſurd and contradictious unto Scripture, that in my opinion it cannot well enter into any judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Divines heart ſo to conceive. And marke how this Authour ſhuffles herein: for firſt he ſaith that ſin may be conſidered either as ſinne; or as a meanes of declaring God's juſtice in puniſhing it. And why doth he not keep himſelfe unto this? eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that not permiſſion of ſin only, but the puniſhment of ſin alſo are jointly the meanes of declaring God's juſtice. And where King <hi>Solomon</hi> profeſſeth that God made the very wicked againſt the day of evill, in the ſame place he manifeſteth what is the end of this; namely in ſaying that he made all things for himſelfe, that is for the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own glory. And this glory is not only in the way of juſtice; but in the way of mercy alſo; which this Authour as his manner is, very judiciouſly conceales; this attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of mercy lying not ſo open to this Authours evaſion as that of juſtice. And is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible God's mercy and the demonſtration thereof ſhould have place where there is no ſin? conſidering that no other evill, or miſery, had entred into the world, had it not been for ſin, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>By one man ſin entred into the world, &amp; death by ſin.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are theſe generalls the only end that God aimed at in this, but many other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ro:</hi> 5.</note> there are, whereby the glory of God's wiſedome and power, and grace doth appeare, by occaſion of ſins entrance into the world. The horrible facts of Jewes and Gentiles co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon the perſon of the Son of God, were ſuch as whereby the Lord brought to paſſe the redemption of the world. if Chriſt had not been crucified what ſatisfaction had been made for the ſins of the world? how could he have been ſet forth as a propitiation for our ſins through faith in his blood? &amp; yet this is not all the glory of God that breaks forth by the permiſſion of ſin. The puniſhment of one ſin by another is an admirable worke of God's providence, and that more waies then one. For God can puniſh, and doth, one man by the ſin of an other. The <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians</hi> committed outrages enough upon the people of God, yet hereby the Lord was juſt in puniſhing the ſins of <note place="margin">

A good end cannot moralize a bad actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. We grant it. But ſeeing it is impoſſible that the divine hand can doe any bad action, the end of his actions is ſufficient to juſtifie his courſes. For as <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath delivered; God's wiſedome is his juſtice. For he is a debtor to none but to himſelfe; and how to himſelfe?

For himſelfe is moſt lovely; and 'tis his nature to be moſt loving of that which is moſt lovely. Now to order all things aright to their congruous ends, is the part of wiſdome. And ſee how extravagant this Authour is in evey one of his inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For to ſteale, to commit adultery, to oppreſſe, to kill, is to ſinne, and in will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of theſe, a man wills his own ſinne. But the Argument we treat of, is of God's willing the ſins of others; as when God's hand and his counſell determined that thoſe things ſhould be done, which by <hi>Herod, Pontius-Pilate,</hi> the Gentiles, and people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael were committed againſt the holy Son of God; and when the Kings gave their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes to the beaſt herein they are ſaid to doe the will of God and <hi>when every mans judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſaid to come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord;</hi> not only judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t juſt, but even judgments unjuſt to wit, of men, yet God hath a juſt hand in plaguing others by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; man ought not to doe evill that good may come thereof; but God's willing it to come to paſſe by his permiſſion is no evill at all; Nay it is good; nor ſo only, but the thing willed by him is good by the confeſſion of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> even then when he is oppoſing us in this very argument; <hi>Malum fieri Deo permittente bonum eſt, it is good that evill ſhould come to paſſe by God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion:</hi> And it was avouched by <hi>Auſtin</hi> many hundred yeares before <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56120:220"/>
borne. And he profeſſeth that God would never have ſuffered ſinne to have entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, had he not knowne <hi>that it appertained to his almighty goodneſſe, rather to work good out of evill, then not at all to ſuffer evill.</hi> Compare the judgment of <hi>Auſtin</hi> with the judgment of this Authour, and conſider whether they differ not as much as light and darkneſſe. And what wiſedome were it for God to permit ſinne (when it is in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to hinder it, as this Authour acknowledgeth in the ſixt <hi>Section)</hi> if it be a greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. (and that to God, as it appeares by his expreſſion of it, <hi>Laeſio divinae majeſtatis, the hurt of the Divine majeſty)</hi> then the good that can come thereby can be? So that the crucifying of Chriſt was greater in the kind of evil, then the redemption of the world that came thereby, was in the kind of good. No man of common diſcretion will permit ought (if it lye in his power to hinder it) to his own diſadvantage, unleſſe he can make thereby, not only an equall advantage, but a greater. But let us farther conſider the ſuperficiary ſpeculation of this Divine, more becomming children in the Church of God then a grave and learned Divine. Sinne, he ſaith, is <hi>laeſio Divinae majeſtatis, the wronging of the Divine majeſty;</hi> but in what ſenſe I pray? Is God any thing the worſe for any man's diſobedience, and tranſgreſſion of God's law? Surely like as he is no way advantaged by our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo is he as little diſadvantaged by our diſobedience. Yet I affect not to carry that I deliver by the authority of mine own bare word, which is this Authours courſe moſt uſually; I repreſent Scripture for it. <hi>If thou ſinneſt, what doeſt thou againſt him; yea when thy ſins are many, what doeſt thou unto him?

                           <hi>what receiveth he at thy hands? Thy wickedneſſe may hurt a man as thou art, and thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe may profit a Son of man.</hi> And in reaſon, looke of what nature the benefit is that redounds from the creature unto God, of the like nature is the detrement. Now God by making the world acquires no internall perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> unto himſelfe, but only makes his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious nature known, and accordingly if the world ſhould have an end, this manifeſtation ſhould ceaſe; but his glorious nature ſhould ſtill continue the ſame. And as he manifeſts his glory by the world, ſo ſome creatures he hath made intelligent, fit to take notice of his glory, and accordingly requires at their hands they ſhould acknowledge it, and that not in word only, but by their dutifull obedience; and that for the farther manifeſtation of his glory, to their good and wonderfull happineſſe, if they obey; and their extream ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and miſery, if they continue rebellious againſt him. So that whereas the end of all God's actions being but the manifeſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his glory, he doth not looſe ſo much as this, by the ſins of men; For he can glorifie himſelfe in their juſt deſtruction; Nay he can ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his glory another way; namely both the glory of his mercy in pardoning their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his majeſty done unto him; which men ſo proud many times they are, can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe; but in ſuch a caſe prove implacable. Likewiſe of his grace in curing it, as alſo his power and wiſedome in procuring a ſtrange ſatisfaction to be made for it in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull manner, and that by his own blood; That ſo way may be made for the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of his, not royall only, but Divine magnificence in beſtowing the kingdome of <note place="margin">

And accordingly as he permits ſins dayly; ſo he offers his free grace dayly for the pardon of them; and to this tended the dayly ſacrifice among the Jewes, of a lamb every morning and a lambe every evening. But why then is ſinne, ſaid to be <hi>laeſio Divinae majeſtatis?</hi> I anſwer this is to be underſtood not of any hurt done to his majeſty in it ſelfe, but as in the minds of men, who hereby manifeſt their contempt of the divine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. And they that doe contemne him would put him out of his throne if they could, &amp; wiſh that there were no God; &amp; the foole would faine bring his heart about to thinke ſo.

Though the members be not oppoſite it matters not; it is ſufficient they are diſparate; the purpoſe of it being to ſhew, not that God doth not will ſin, but only to ſhew under what notion he willeth it.

Is it of juſtice remunerative, or juſtice vindicative? Was it ever heard that permiſſion of ſinne was required to make way for God's juſtice remunerative? Or is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that way can be made for the manifeſtation of Gods juſtice vindicative (in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture called God's wrath) unleſſe ſinne be permitted to enter?

We ſay the horrible outrages committed upon our Saviour, God foredetermined to be done; And told <hi>David</hi> that he would give his wives unto his neighbour, who ſhould lye with them before the Sun; And that it was his will that the Kings ſhould give their Kingdome to the Beaſt; this we deliver according to God's word; whereas all this our oppoſit's diſcourſe is quite beſides the word of God; as if he would have us take his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd conceits in ſteed of oracles. And doth he not know that <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſometimes ſayd that, <hi>Iudas electus eſt ad prodendum ſanguinem Domini, Iudas was choſen to betray his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter?</hi> Or will he anſwer that he was the firſt that ſaid ſo?</p>

Hoord,</hi> in the preface and ſecond <hi>Section.</hi> There I have ſhewed how that it was merely deviſliſh policy in <hi>Tiberius</hi> to move him to take this courſe, to make way for a grand child of his own, to bring him to the imperiall throne, This moved him to ſeeke the death of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> his two Sons, whom <hi>Auguſtus</hi> made him to adopt as ſucceſſours in the empire, &amp; leſt the putting of them to death without cauſe might provoke the people to muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt him; therfore by cunning contrivances he cauſed them to be provoked to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile him, that ſo he might have ſome cauſe to juſtifie his deſtroying of them; which yet he did not by any publique execution; he was loath to come to that for feare of raiſing ſome tumult thereby; <hi>Fame necavit, he famiſhed them.</hi> Now how hath Satan poſſeſſed the heart of this unhappy Divine thus to blaſpheme the holy one of Iſraell by comparing his waies to theſe abominable courſes of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> not fearing leſt his tongue rot in his head while he is uttering of them? Cannot God take the life of any man from him, be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo innocent, and that what way he will, even by puniſhment, if it pleaſe him? For is it not of God's mere mercy that he promiſeth, <hi>Not to famiſh the ſoule of the rightous?</hi> As for provoking courſes, is it not apparent by theſe our oppoſites confeſſion, that to all the provoking courſes in the world God doth concurre, and that as an efficient cauſe of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry action? And accordingly he did concurre with theſe provoking courſes uſed by <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi> And did not God profeſſe that he would <hi>provoke the Iſraelites by a fooliſh people, and by a fooliſh nation he would anger them?</hi> How did <hi>Shimei</hi> provoke <hi>David</hi> by railing upon him; And how did <hi>David</hi> interpret it, The Lord, ſaith he, hath bid him to curſe <hi>David?</hi>

Not that he gave any ſuch command in proper ſpeech, but by his ſecret providence brought this to paſſe, uſing to this purpoſe the vitious diſpoſition which he found in <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei,</hi> but cauſed it not.

The ſumme is, whatſoever we deliver as touching God's ſecret providence in evill, we have expreſſe ſcripture for us, nothing but pretence of carnall reaſon againſt us; which when it comes to be examined, is found ſubject to manifeſt contradiction, both as touching their feigning things future without the decree of God; And as touching their conditionall decrees, and conditionall concurrences; ours is not in any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; The greateſt ſhew of contradiction on our parts is in the point of neceſſitie and libertie; Now to cleare this, as others, have taken paines, ſo have I in my <hi>Vindiciae</hi> proving divers and ſundry waies, that theſe two doe amically conſpire, to wit, the <note place="margin">

                           <p>Chriſt, the Chriſtian faith, the word and Sacraments, and whatſoever according to the Scriptures hath been done for the applying of the pardon of ſinne, are all but mere fables, nay very impoſtures, if ſinne be nothing.

He begins with an axiome, that, <hi>Neceſſity hath no law;</hi> and hereupon he doth expatiate with his inſtances too too imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently; a courſe which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> takes not, whom yet I have anſwered on this very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in my <hi>Vindiciae;</hi> leaſt of all doth he offer to make any reply upon any parcell of my anſwer unto <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> Now this axiome is not applied to Agents unreaſonable, but only reaſonable, by them who treat thereof. As in caſe a man be driven to ſteale, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve naturall neceſſity; yet all confeſſe that a man is not only unexecuſable, but alſo not to be pitied, if he hath brought this neceſſity upon him; And never any ſober man that I know, denied ſtealth to be a free action, for all this. It is true Lyons are not forbidden to prey, nor fiſhes to ſwimne, nor bruit creatures to doe according to their kind. For they are unreaſonable, and conſequently not capable of command, otherwiſe then by ſpurre, or goad, or the like; nor capable of admonition, in like ſort, children afore they come to the uſe of reaſon are not capable, of admonition As neither mad men are, nor fooles, ſuch as we call naturall; But this Authour is none ſuch. For then his wit would not ſerve him for oppoſition as it doth. It is true likewiſe, that as man is made after the Image of God, not as touching his part vegetative; nor as touching his part ſenſitive; but only as touching his part reaſonable, conſiſting of an underſtanding, whereby he is enabled to know his ſuperiours, and their commands, and admonitions; and of a will whereby he is able to performe obedience both inward and outward, it having command over all parts of the body to ſet them in motion; whereupon if their Lord command them to come they come, if to goe they goe, if to doe this they doe it; As the <hi>Centurion</hi> ſignified, to our Saviour the readineſſe of his ſervants to doe their Maſters commands.</p>
                        <p>At length he comes to conclude that, <hi>if to deale juſtly, to exerciſe charitie &amp;c. with their contraries be abſolutely &amp; antecedently neceſſary too, whether this neceſſity flow from a principle within or a mover without, we are as lawleſſe in theſe as in the other,</hi> by theſe he meanes acts of the ſoule rationall; by <hi>the other,</hi> he meanes acts of the ſoule vegetative, or ſenſitive. Now we utterly deny that any of theſe are abſolutely neceſſary; Nay we deny that any thing is of abſolute neceſſity, but the being of the Divine nature; and the internall ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations thereof which conſtitute the diſtinction of perſons in the Trinity. For albeit ſome
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56120:223"/>
Agents created are Agents neceſſary, working neceſſarily; yet the works which they bring forth are not of abſolute neceſſity, becauſe they may be hindred in their operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; either by Angells as ſome of them; or at leaſt by the power of God, all of them. And as there are neceſſary Agents working neceſſarily; ſo there are free Agents working con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingently and freely; as Angells and men. And albeit a queſtion may be made as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acts ſupernaturall, whether the creature hath any free power to performe them free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſuch as are the acts of the three Theologicall vertues, faith, hope, and charity, and none other, (which yet we doe not deny, but grant upon the infuſion of a ſupernaturall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple into our ſoules, which we count formally the life of grace; the cauſe whereof we take to be the Spirit of God given unto us, and dwelling in our hearts;) yet there deſerves to be no queſtion, but that as touching all actions of morall vertues, and of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vitious actions, that there is a free power in man to performe them naturally; untill ſuch time as by a vitious diſpoſition, procured by a cuſtome in vitious courſes a man is habitually inclined unto evill; whereby he is made a ſlave to vice, and thereby hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived himſelfe of a morall liberty unto actions vertuous. For like as a man holding a ſtone in his hand hath power to throw him or no, or to throw him which way he will; but as ſoone as he hath throwne him out of his hand; it is no longer free unto him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will throw it or no. In like manner before a vitious habit contracted, man hath freedome morall unto actions vertuous, but not after. This is the doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and thus he illuſtrates it. For certainely the habit of vertue is not an indifferent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note place="margin">

So is the habit of juſtice a morall propenſion and inclination to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme only that which is juſt. The like may be ſaid of every morall vertue in ſpeciall. How much more doth ſupernaturall grace conſiſt not in a power to believe, if a man will, to love God if he will, to hope and waite for the joyes of heaven if he will, and if he will to refuſe to performe any of theſe acts, but rather an holy and heavenly habit, or weight wrought in the ſoule of man, moving and ſwaying it only to gracious acts pleaſing &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the ſight of God, which indeed conſtitutes a ſpirituall liberty from ſinne, and makes a man become the holy ſervant of God, willing to receive direction from him, and delighting to be ordered by him in all our waies. On the other ſide with out grace a man is left in that naturall corruption wherein he was conceived &amp; borne, which makes him a ſlave to ſinne and a vaſſall to Satan led captive by him to doe his will. Yet not withſtanding there remaines in every one his naturall liberty ſtill, which conſiſts only in <note place="margin">

                           </note> the choice of meanes conducing to man's end; whereas morall vertue and grace doe order the will a right towards aright end; morall vertues according to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge naturall which he hath of his right end naturall, grace according to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg ſupernaturall, which a man hath of his right end ſupernaturall, which is to be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſed and ordered towards God his maker; So that this naturall liberty ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth the ſame; As for example, he that it vertuous ſo farre forth as he is vertuous, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth ſtill free; not as freedome ſignifies an indifferency to performe an act vertuous vitious, but being thereby diſpoſed only to vertuous actions, he is free whether to exerciſe this or that vertuous act, according to occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s offered; or in the ſame kind of a vertuous diſpoſition; whether he will doe this or that in particular, as to give in ſuch a proportion, or in ſuch a ſeaſon, or to ſuch or ſuch perſons, in all which being of a vertuous diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he is ready to receive directions from the dictates of <hi>recta ratio, right reaſon,</hi> otherwiſe called wiſedome. In like manner a vitious perſon ſtill keeps his naturall liberty, though he hath loſt his morall, and is become <hi>Servus tot dominorum, quot vitiorum, a ſlave to ſo many Lords as there are vices in him,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſomewhere ſpeaketh. I ſay he keeps ſtill his naturall liberty. For let him be a Robber, he ſtill continueth free to make choice of his complices, of places wherein to lye in waite for his prey, of weapons, and the like. Let him be an impure perſon, ſtill he continueth free to chooſe whom he will corrupt, to contrive what courſe he thinks beſt for the ſatisfaction of his luſts. Let him be covetuous or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, ſtill he contintinueh free to make choice of the meanes conducing to the end ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by him. In like ſort let him be regenerate, a child of God; by this ſpirit of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration he is moved only to doe thoſe things which are pleaſing to his heavenly father, but ſtill his naturall liberty continueth the ſame, as whether to exerciſe the grace which God hath given him in one kind or in another, or in the ſame kind in what particular he thinks good. If he thinks good to pray, it is free to him to fall upon the confeſſion of his ſins, or upon thankſgiving, or upon ſupplication, &amp; that either for bleſſings tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and the releife of his naturall neceſſities; or for grace, and the reliefe of neceſſities
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56120:223"/>
ſpirituall; or to exerciſe himſelfe in every kind of theſe, and that in what order he thinks good. So likewiſe if he give himſelfe to meditation, and make choice of what matter he thinks good, as alſo of time and place, in all this he is free. None of all theſe diſtinctions doth this Authour take notice of, but hand over head talks of freedome to performe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acts vicious, or vertuous; whereas the vertuous man's will, as he is vertuous, is inclined to vertuous courſes alone; and the vitious man, as he is vitious, is inclined to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious courſes alone, and not to vertuous. And it was wont to be ſaid, that, <hi>Habitus agunt ad modum naturae, habit's</hi> (whether vertuous or vitious) <hi>they worke after the manner of nature,</hi> that is naturally and neceſſary, as before I have declared of a morall neceſſity, which ſtill conſiſts with a naturall liberty; either in vertuous, or vitious exerciſes to make choice of particulars in reſpect of all variety of circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances, according as their reaſon ſuggeſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in the uſe of means conducent to the end intended, whether that end be good or bad. No dominion of abſolute neceſſity in all this; Much leſſe is any man good by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity but by freedome of will accuſtoming himſelfe unto good actions accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the dictates of reaſon. But a man that is dead in ſinne hath no power to rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate himſelfe; this worke of regeneration is wrought merely by the power of God: Like as the raiſing of a man from death to life, whereunto it is often compared in holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as alſo to creation; And by regeneration we are ſaid to be made new creatures, now as God workes this in time, ſo from everlaſting he did decree to worke it; and it was wont to be the generall Tenet of Proteſtant Divines in oppoſition unto Papiſts, that a man in his firſt converſion is merely paſſive, in which particular <hi>Roffenſis</hi> a Popiſh Biſhop about an hundred yeares agoe oppoſed <hi>Martin Luther.</hi> As for a ſinfull or a vitious act, that is alwaies an act naturall; For acts ſupernaturall can neither be vitious, nor ſinfull; but merely gracious. And all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that as all men have naturall power to performe any act naturall, ſo have they power alſo to abſtaine from it. Only untill a man is regenerate he cannot but ſinne; yea though he doe that which is good as touching the ſubſtance of the act, or abſtaine from that which is evill in like manner; yet can he not performe the one or abſtaine from the other in a gracious manner, <hi>Therefore you heare not God's word,</hi> ſaith our Saviour to the Jewes, <hi>becauſe ye are not of God. They that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe</hi>

                        <p>Now truely this <hi>Theologue</hi> taketh very profitable paines to prove that ſin is not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and exuberates in the proofe hereof to the very ſolid conviction of all thoſe that imagine it to be nothing, if there be any ſuch creatures <hi>in terra Auſtrali incognitâ,</hi> which is not very likely; but rather in the Lunary world, or in the Joviall world which is waited upon with foure moones, as they that came lately from the diſcovery thereof, have made report unto us. But by the way, I hope he doth not juggle with us, and under colour of making ſin to be ſome thing, labour to draw us to an acknowledgment that it is ſome poſitive thing, as Doctor <hi>Iackson</hi> in his laſt booke the 8th, as I take it of his <hi>Commentaries</hi> upon the Creed laboureth to prove with great ſtrength of affections; Like as in the ſame vigour of reſolution he profeſſeth that <hi>whether God puniſheth ſinne neceſſarily or no it is not determinable by the wit of man;</hi> but he is not over prodigall of his reaſons for either. We are very willing to grant that every ſin as ſin is ſomething privative, and as touching the act ſubſtrate, it is ſomething poſitive alſo; And when the Apoſtle defineth ſin by <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>privative,</hi> clearely the forme of ſin is made to conſiſt in privation, as much as to ſay <hi>an incongruity to the law of God;</hi> that is a privation of congruity thereunto. Now we are come to an end of this, let me admoniſh the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the wiſedome of this Authour; All along; he ſuppoſeth that by our doctrine ſinne comes to paſſe by abſolute neceſſity, this I ſay he ſuppoſeth, he proveth it not, though we utterly deny, that any ſuch neceſſity is conſequent to our doctrine. And this himſelfe knowes full well. <hi>Alvarez,</hi> who maintaines that God determines the creatures will to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very act thereof, even to the act of ſin, utterly denies that any abſolute neceſſity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane acts followeth hereupon; or any neceſſity that ſtands in contradiction to humane liberty. Bradwardine alſo ſometime Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury elect maintaines, that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56120:224"/>
God neceſſitates the will to every act thereof, yet denies peremptorily that humane acts comes to paſſe by abſolute neceſſity, or by any neceſſity that ſtands in oppoſition to the liberty of the creature; Only he ſaith that ſome kind of neceſſity, and that antecedent may well conſiſt with the liberty of the creature. All this, this Author knows; yet takes no paines to diſprove their tenet, or anſwer any one of their arguments; no nor to make good his own conſequence, which is the only thing we deny in this preſent argument of his. As for the other part, namely that in caſe ſin come to paſſe by abſolute neceſſity, and without any free will in the creature, then ſinne is no ſinne, which no man denies; This he proves at large, or at leaſt illuſtrates at large. Secondly obſerve he talkes of things neceſſarily comming to paſſe, not only abſolutely but antecedently; whereby he ſeemes to grant that ſins may come to paſſe neceſſarily, but not ſo abſolutely as antecedently, and takes no paines to explicate theſe his diſtinctions. And in my judgment they have more need of explication, as they are accommodated to ſins comming to paſſe in the world, then as they are acommodated to the eveniency of faith and repentance; Yet I imagine this word Antecedently is brought in of purpoſe in reference to good actions ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then in reference unto evill. And whether he will have this terme <hi>Antecedently</hi> to be an addition to the former terme <hi>Abſolutely,</hi> or only of equivalent force, I know not. But it is the common courſe of theſe men to confound their Reader with termes propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed without all explication. But let us endeavour to boult out the meaning of theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed diſcourſes as well as we can. Will this Authour have ſaith to come to paſſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily and that abſolutely, but not antecedently? Or will he have faith to come to paſſe neceſſarily, but not abſolutely and antecedently? or will he have faith come to paſſe not neceſſarily at all: If not at all neceſſarily to what purpoſe doth he clog his Reader with ſuch unneceſſary complements, <hi>of abſolutely and antecedently?</hi> If God decrees to beſtow faith upon a man, doth it not, neceſſarily follow hereupon that ſuch a one ſhall believe? dares this Authour deny it? Yet we account not this abſolutely neceſſary, but merely u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſuppoſition. Neither doth God's decree impoſe neceſſity upon all things; as <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath long agoe diſputed and proved; but only upon ſome things; that is that ſome Agents ſhall worke neceſſarily; other Agents contingently and freely. In a word God both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth things to come to paſſe &amp; the manner of them alſo; that is that ſome things ſhall come to paſſe neceſſarily, other things contingently and freely. But God's decree, we ſay, is abſolute not conditionall, of giving faith. And indeed all his decrees are abſolute as touching the act of God willing; as <hi>Bradwardine</hi> hath demonſtrated by cleare reaſon; and <hi>Piſcator</hi> out of the word of God. But the decree of giving faith is not abſolute only as touching the act of God decreeing, but as touching the thing decreed. For faith is not given by God to any upon a condition to be performed by man; For if it were, then faith ſhould be given according unto workes, that is, grace ſhould be conferred according to mens workes. And when I conſider this Authour's compounding of theſe termes abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and antecedently, I begin to ſuſpect that like as then a thing comes to paſſe antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, when it comes to paſſe by an Antecedent decree in this Authour's language, (though moſt abſurd.) So in his language, the things are ſaid to come to paſſe by abſolute neceſſity, when they come to paſſe by an abſolute decree; the decree in his opinion being ſufficient to make a thing come to paſſe neceſſarily; &amp; an abſolute decree to make it come to paſſe abſolutely neceſſarily. This undoubtedly is his meaning, upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which I am ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled are I am aware. Now let the ſober Reader judge how farre theſe odde conceits are from all ſobriety. Did not God decree to make the world, nay did he not abſolutely decree this and antecedently, not conditionally and conſequently? What therefore will it here-hence follow that the world had it's exiſtence neceſſarily, and that by the way of abſolute neceſſity? I had thought this had been the peculiar and incommunicable perfection of God himſelfe, namely to exiſt neceſſarily, and that in the way of abſolute neceſſity. As for all other things which are but God's creatures, they have only a contingent exiſtence derived originally from the free will of God the Creator. For this I take to be the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent perfection of God, <hi>To be</hi> moſt neceſſarily; to worke moſt freely; Neceſſity and that abſolute, being the greateſt perfection of being: So that <hi>Bradwardine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives this to be the prime and originall perfection of God, <hi>eſſe neceſſario,</hi> to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.

                           <hi>taketh away the conſcience of ſin;</hi> and this we willingly grant is conſequent upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. For if ſinne be no ſinne, there is no cauſe why any man ſhould be troubled with the conſcience of ſin. But all this being grounded upon a vile and moſt untrue imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on never yet proved, namely that we make all actions both good and evill to come to paſſe by abſolute neceſſity, there can be no more truth in the conſequent then there is in the Antecedent. We ſay that every ſinne that is, or ever was committed in the world is and ever was committed freely, not only voluntarily; much leſſe doth any ſinne come to paſſe by any abſolute neceſſity. For albeit there be ſome things that come to paſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily by neceſſity of nature, as proceeding from Agents naturall, working naturally and neceſſarily. Yet is no worke of nature wrought by any abſolute neceſſity. God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to ſet an end to nature and the works thereof whenſoever it pleaſeth him; and while nature continueth according to the good pleaſure of God, he reſtraines the courſe thereof, or changeth it as he thinks good. How much leſſe doe the actions of men, not only in reſpect of God's agency, who is the firſt cauſe, but in reſpect of man's agency, a ſecond cauſe, and working deliberately and freely come to paſſe not neceſſarily, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingently, and freely; So farre off are they from comming to paſſe by abſolute neceſſity; to exiſt by abſolute neceſſity being the incommunicable perfection of God himselfe. But I confeſſe this Authour ſheweth ſome humanity in the proofe of it, to wit, out of the <hi>Tragedian</hi> very judiciouſly and learnedly. <hi>Fati eſt iſta culpa; nemo fit fato nocens. It is the fault of fate or deſtiny, and what comes to paſſe by deſtiny is no fault of man's.</hi> Yet <hi>Zeno</hi> the great Patron of Fate, finding his ſervant in a fault, when his ſervant excuſed himſelfe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fate, ſaying it was deſtiny that he ſhould ſteale; made a ready anſwer ſaying, <hi>Et cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> it was his deſtiny alſo to be puniſhed; So farre was he from juſtifying or excuſing his ſervant upon any ſuch ground, or forbearing to puniſh him. And doth not this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour know that <hi>Iocaſta</hi> for all her acknowledgment of fate governing all things; yet in conſcience of her inceſtuous courſes deſtroyed her ſelfe in the ſame <hi>Tragedian?</hi> But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, indifferent Reader, whether this Authour doth not carry himſelfe, as if he were dealing with little children, and his purpoſe were not to informe them; but to abuſe and mocke them. For is that all waies the faith or opinion of the <hi>Tragedian,</hi> whatſoever he puts into the mouthes of this or that Actor? Doe not they repreſent the abſurd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of ſome, as well as the reaſonable diſcourſes of others? Then againe who are they that maintaine, <hi>Fatum, deſtiny?</hi> Where hath he found this maintained by any of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines? Yet I confeſſe this Authour deales ingeniouſly in one thing, to wit, in walking ſo fairely in the ſteps of this forefathers.

                           <p>Not temporally, as God himſelfe hath given us to underſtand by that law which he preſcribed the Jewes <hi>Deut:</hi> 22. 25. Which was that it a Maid commit uncleaneſſe by conſtraint, ſhe ſhould not be puniſhed. His reaſon was becauſe there was no cauſe of death in her; what ſhe yeilded to was through compulſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overborne by power; As a man that is wounded to death by his neighbour; ſo was a Virgin in that caſe a ſufferer rather then a doer. This particular law is of univerſall right: No juſt puniſhment can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlicted for ſinne, where there is no power in the party to avoid it. The ſpeech of <hi>Lipſius</hi> is but a mere crorchet contrary to reaſon, <hi>(Fatali culpae fatalis poena) fatall faults muſt have fatall puniſhments.</hi> Did magiſtrates thinke mens offences unavoidable, they would thinke it bootleſſe, and unreaſonable to puniſh them.

And ſo neither was the womans fact juſtified, the lawes not allowing of it; Nor yet the woman puniſhed becauſe ſhe was worthy to be pardoned.

God muſt have the prerogative ſtill of being the firſt mover, the firſt cauſe, the firſt Agent, the firſt free Agent; So farre off are we from maintaining that the actions of men have their being by abſolute neceſſity; that we utterly deny any thing in the world to have 'its exiſtence by abſolute neceſſity, ſaving God alone, as before I have ſhewed. <hi>Sciendum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Durand, quod loquendo de neceſſitate ſimpliciter, voluntas divina</hi>

Therefore we ſay the influence of God neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to every action, is made into the will it ſelfe moving it agreably to the nature thereof, to doe whatſoever it doth, not voluntarily only, but freely alſo; taking liberty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and as it ought to be taken, that is in the choice of meanes tending to an end, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that end be a man's right end or no. For it is confeſſed by Moraliſts that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the will towards it's congruous end, is naturall and neceſſary, not free. But this brave Gentleman carrieth himſelfe aloft, and ſuperciliouſly deſpiſing to enter into any of theſe liſts of argumentation; and as if the matter were <hi>concluſum contra Manichaeos,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently ſuppoſeth, without all proofe, that we maintaine that all humane actions come to paſſe by abſolute neceſſity: Whereas to the contrary 'tis evident that nothing in the world hath it's exiſtence by abſolute neceſſity, ſaving God alone. 'Tis true, God's decree is unalterable, and whatſoever comes to paſſe comes to paſſe by his will ſaith <hi>Auſtin:</hi> and the Church of Ireland; By the effectuall will of God, ſaith <hi>Aquinas,</hi> as which, he makes the roote of all contingency; And therefore as neceſſary cauſes worke neceſſarily by the will of God; ſo by the ſame will of God doe contingent Agents worke contingently; and free Agents worke voluntarily and freely. And obſerve the immodeſty of this Authour, he tells us what <hi>Zeno's</hi> ſervant pleaded for himſelfe with his Maſter; but he doth not tell what <hi>Zeno</hi> anſwered him, that he conceales; it is enough for him to gull and cheate poore ignorants. <hi>The Adrumetine Monks,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>were miſled by Auſtin;</hi> a vile imputation caſt upon that man whoſe memory hath been alwaies honourable in the Church of God; and the memoriall of his oppoſites rots. Did <hi>Auſtin</hi> miſleade them? did he draw them into errour? If they did miſtake <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſhall it be true there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſay they were miſled by him? How many miſtake and miſunderſtand God's word; what then? ſhall we be ſo audacious and blaſphemous, as to ſay they are miſled by the word of God? Why may not ſuch impudent perſons proceed, and ſay they are miſled by the holy Ghoſt? Then that which he ſaith of theſe Monks, as miſled by <hi>Auſtin,</hi> it is a notorious untruth; <hi>Creſconius</hi> and <hi>Felix</hi> that came over to <hi>Auſtin</hi> of their own heads to complaine of ſome in their Monaſtry; laid to their charge indeed that <hi>they ſo taught grace, that they denied freewill;</hi> &amp; that this they pretended to have learned out of <hi>Auſtin's</hi> booke written to <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Preſbyter. But <hi>Auſtin</hi> was not haſty to believe this cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: And therefore he ſaith diſjunctively of that Monke of whom they complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Aut librum meum non intelligit, aut ipſe non intelligitur; either he underſtands not my booke; or himſelfe is not well underſtood by his brethren.</hi> If the information were true, then that Brother of whom they complained miſtooke <hi>Auſtin.</hi> For <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth not any where ſo maintaine grace, as to deny free-will. But if that Brother underſtood <hi>Auſtin</hi> aright in that foreſaid booke of his, then he maintained no ſuch opinion as <hi>Creſconius</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> laid to his charge, but they rather miſunderſtood him. And this appeared to be moſt true afterwards. For <hi>Florus</hi> was the man whom <hi>Creſconius</hi> and <hi>Felix</hi> accuſed, and whom <hi>Auſtin</hi> deſired of <hi>Valentinus</hi> the father of them, that he would ſend over unto him, as <hi>Coccius</hi> acknowledgeth, &amp; accordingly he was ſent over to <hi>Auſtin,</hi> as appeares in <hi>Auſtin's</hi> booke <hi>De corrept. &amp; gratiâ cap.</hi> 1. With whom when <hi>Auſtin</hi> had conferred, he found him moſt orthodoxe as himſelfe profeſſeth in the chapter mentioned, and therein much rejoyced, and withall ſignifieth to <hi>Valentinus</hi> that they deſerved rather to be checked who miſunderſtood <hi>Florus.</hi> And therefore when <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his Retractations comes to take notice of his booke <hi>De gratiâ &amp; libero arbitrio,</hi> and the occaſion of writing thereof, he ſets it downe not abſolutely, <hi>becauſe of thoſe who ſo doe maintaine grace, as withall they deny free-will, but with a disjunctive addition,</hi> thus, <hi>or becauſe of thoſe who thinke when grace is maintained, therewithall that free-will is denied.</hi> The firſt was delivered in reference to the crimination made before him by <hi>Creſconius,</hi> and <hi>Felix</hi> againſt <hi>Florus;</hi> but the latter was according to <hi>Auſtin's</hi> ſuſpicion at the firſt, which proved afterwards to be a truth, as appeares by the firſt chapter of <hi>Auſtin's</hi> booke <hi>de correptione &amp; gratiâ;</hi> where <hi>Florus</hi> is juſtified and magnified by St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and his criminators condemned. And ſeing there were none ſuch among the Monks of Adrumetum, as the accuſants pretended, who ſo maintained grace, as to deny free-will; therefore that alſo muſt needs be falſe which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in this Authour, when he ſaith that againſt them alſo St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> wrote his other
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56120:228" rendition="simple:additions"/>
booke <hi>De correptione &amp; gratiâ:</hi> And the truth is the whole buiſineſſe was ended and the tumult appeaſed between thoſe Adrumetine Monks, before <hi>Florus</hi> came over; as appeared by the relation made unto him by <hi>Florus</hi> concerning the amicable compoſition of all things there. And <hi>Auſtin</hi> in this very paſſage which this Authour grates upon, profeſſeth that he writes not againſt them; only he anſwereth ſuch an objection (For I conceive it to be no other) more fully which was made by ſome of them formerly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Florus,</hi> and the doctrine of <hi>Auſtin</hi> maintained by <hi>Florus.</hi> The relation whereof was brought unto him by the ſame <hi>Florus,</hi> as it ſeemes.

Yet was not <hi>Zeno</hi> ſo well inſtructed in the myſtery of Divine providence, as we are by the word of God; even from the ſelling of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> all along to the crucifying of the Son of God; &amp; from thence to the Kings giving up their Kingdomes to the Beaſt, which ſhould come to paſſe in the latter part of the laſt times of the world.

                           <p n="1">1. That the Ancients did uſe to call a necſſity of humane actions good or bad, by the name of deſtiny, from what externall cauſe ſoever this neceſſity did ariſe.</p>

                           <p n="3">3. (Which is for our preſent purpoſe) that they believed and contended that the judgments of God on ſinners could not be juſt, if they were held by the Adamantine chaines of any abſolute neceſſity, under the power of their ſins.</p>
                           <p>I will therefore conclude this Argument with the words of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> writing of the errour of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We have no need, I ſhould thinke of the Authority of any fathers to juſtifie this. Where <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> doth this Authour find, that we maintaine that a man is good or evill, <hi>not freely but by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,</hi> that <hi>Tertullian</hi> is brought in as oppoſing us here? Yet we thinke this is worthy of diſtinction: For was not <hi>Adam</hi> made by God habitually good? <hi>Durand.</hi> I am ſure, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines that in his creation he was endued with all Morall vertues: &amp; this we read in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that all things which God made were very good: &amp; as other things were made very good in their kind: So I preſume man was made very good in his kind: and how this could be unleſſe he were made vertuous, I cannot conceive. So likewiſe man being brought forth in the corrupt maſſe; when afterwards he is made good either in the way of juſtification, or in the way of regeneration; theſe are no free acts of Man, but rather the free acts of God. I preſume this Authour dares not ſay that man regenerates himſelfe But as for the denomination of goodneſſe and badneſſe in man, that ariſeth from any actions of his, I willingly grant all ſuch goodneſſe or badneſſe is acquired freely, not neceſſarily.</p>
                        <p>And as <hi>Tertullian</hi> takes neceſſity, to wit in oppoſition unto liberty; So I preſume doth <hi>Hierome</hi> too; otherwiſe theſe two Fathers were yoaked together unequally in this place. Now we know no ſuch neceſſity domineering in man, as ſtands in oppoſition to liberty. Much leſſe doe we maintaine any neceſſity over the will of man, depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fatall conſtellations; And as <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and <hi>Auſtin</hi> diſcourſe thus of neceſſity in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to fatall conſtellations; So it ſeemes likely that <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of neceſſity in the ſame ſenſe. <hi>To ſinne by the will of God</hi> in <hi>Proſper</hi> is to ſin <hi>by</hi> the <hi>predeſtination of God,</hi> as appeares both by <hi>the Objection it ſelfe, and Proſper's anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto throughout.</hi> Now predeſtination in the fathers meaning is of no other things, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch as God purpoſed to worke. And accordingly we anſwer that no evill in the world, as evill, comes to paſſe by God's will to worke it; but only by God's will to permit it. And it is <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin's</hi> expreſſe profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that <hi>Non aliquid fit niſi omnipotens fieri velit. Not any thing comes to paſſe, unles God Almighty will have it come to paſſe;</hi> but how? Not all after one manner, but after a different manner; ſome by working them, others by permitting them; <hi>vel ſinendo ut fiat, vel ipſe faciendo; either by ſuffering it to come to paſſe,</hi> in caſe it be evill, or himſelfe <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it,</hi> in caſe it be good. <hi>Fulgentius</hi> juſtifies this ſenſe in his ſentence here alleadged. For <hi>to ſinne by God's will</hi> in <hi>Proſper,</hi> is all one with <hi>being made an offender</hi> (or made to ſinne) <hi>by God,</hi> in <hi>Fulgentius.</hi> Now we ſay God makes many a man good by regeneration; but he makes none evill; only he doth not cure that naturall or habituall viciouſneſſe, which he finds amongſt men, in all. For <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth;</hi> and indeed he is bound to none. St. <hi>Bernard</hi> clearely maintaines that there is noe liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from ſinne in any naturall man; and conſequently every naturall man is caſt upon a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſinning; and therefore that <hi>liberty from neceſſity which he grants to man,</hi> can be no other then liberty from compulſion; And ſo Dr. <hi>Fulke</hi> uſually makes the diſtinction run between <hi>Liberty from ſin, and liberty from coaction;</hi> &amp; denying the one he grants the other.</p>
                        <p>That the Antients did call that neceſſity, which ariſeth from the will of God upon the will of the creature by the name of deſtiny; This Authour brings not the leaſt colour of <note place="margin">1.</note> proofe; neither do I thinke he is able to bring any, ſave only of the Pelagians, who tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Auſtin's</hi> doctrine of predeſtination by the name of deſtiny. And ſo they traduced his doctrine in denying that grace was conferred according to mens workes; whereupon it was that he built his doctrine of predeſtination, as is apparent <hi>De bono perſeverantiae. c.</hi> 15. In the ſecond I wonder this Author obſerves not how he contradicts himſelfe. For if they uſed theſe words <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> &amp; <hi>compulſion;</hi> promiſcuouſly; doth it not evidently follow that <note place="margin">2.</note> they diſtinguiſhed them not? but alwaies tooke them of equivalent ſignification. But I doe not find that <hi>Auſtin</hi> tooke <hi>neceſſity</hi> of the ſame ſignification with <hi>compulſion;</hi> when he
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56120:230" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſtinguiſheth of neceſſity; ſaying ſome neceſſity is ſuch, as whereby a thing befalls a man, whether he will or no; as the neceſſity of death; and to ſuch a neceſſity he ſaith, the will is not ſubject. Another neceſſity there is, as when we ſay, <hi>It muſt needs be, that this, or that come to paſſe,</hi> and he confeſſeth plainly that the will may be ſubject to ſuch a neceſſity, without danger or prejudice to the liberty thereof.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 And well they might hold that God's <hi>judgments were not juſt on ſinners, if they were held by any abſolute neceſſity under the power of their ſins.</hi> We ſay that nothing hath either exiſtence, or continuance, by abſolute neceſſity, ſave God alone. But I gueſſe this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour calls that neceſſity abſolute, which flowes from God's abſolute decree. Now if he will have God's decrees to be conditionall, it ſtands him upon to prove it, not bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſe it. Eſpecially ſeeing <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath profeſſed that never any man was ſo mad as to ſay that there is any cauſe of God's predeſtination, as touching the act of God's prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinating; and that there can be no cauſe hereof he proves becauſe there can be no cauſe of God's will, as touching the act of God willing, as formerly he had proved. And Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Iackson</hi> in his booke of providence confeſſeth that the diſtinction of God's will, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a will antecedent, and a will conſequent, is not to be underſtood as touching the act of God willing; but as touching the things willed. And accordingly, ſeeing reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it<hi>'s</hi> kind is the will of God, as well as predeſtination in it's kind; it followeth, that as there can be no cauſe of the will of God, as touching the act of God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; no cauſe of predeſtination, as touching the act of God predeſtinating; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can there be any cauſe of Reprobation, as touching the act of God repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating. And looke how mad a thing it is for any man to maintaine that there is ſome cauſe of predeſtination, as touching the act of God predeſtinating. So as mad a thing it muſt be every way to avouch that there is a cauſe of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, as touching the act of God reprobating. And truely the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſts that upon what ground he proves, that Election is not of good works (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe before <hi>Iacob</hi> or <hi>Eſau</hi> were borne, or had done good or evill, it was ſaid, <hi>The elder ſhall ſerve the younger)</hi> upon the ſame ground we may be bold to conclude, that Reprobation is not of evill workes. And the ſame reaſon manifeſts that faith and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity are excluded from being the cauſes, the one of Election, the other of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as well as good and evill workes. And both <hi>Piſcator</hi> by evidence of Scripture, and <hi>Bradwardine</hi> by evidence of reaſon have demonſtrated, that no will of God is conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, which is to be underſtood, as touching the act of God willing. And it may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently further demonſtrated thus; If any thing be the cauſe of God's will, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by neceſſity of nature, or by the conſtitution of God; Not by neceſſity of nature, as is evident and all confeſſe, there being no colour of truth for that; beſides ſuch an opinion were moſt dangerouſly prejudiciall to God's ſoveraignty, and liberty. If therefore they ſay, it is by the conſtitution of God, maſke I pray what an inſuperable abſurdity followeth hereupon. For ſeing God's conſtitution is his will, it followeth that God did will that <hi>upon foreſight of this or that he would will ſuch a man's ſalvation, and ſuch a man's damnation.</hi> And thus the act of God's will is made the Object of God's will, even the eternall act of God's will; Whereas to the contrary it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that the objects of God's will are things temporall, never any thing that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall But as touching things willed, we readily grant, it may be ſaid there is a cauſe thereof as School-Divines doe generally acknowledge. And thus <hi>Gerardus Voſſius</hi> ſpeaks of the conditionall will, which he faith the Fathers doe aſcribe to God. For this is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which he gives thereof, as for example, when God ordaines to beſtow ſalvation on a man in caſe he believe; here faith is made the condition of Salvation, but not of the will of God And in like manner we willingly grant that reprobation is conditionall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as God intends to inflict damnation on none, but ſuch as die in ſin without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance But albeit predeſtination, as touching this particular thing willed, may be ſaid to be conditionall according as the School-men explicate their meaning; and reprobation like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as touching the particular of da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned: yet no ſuch thing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be truely affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med either of the one or of the other, as touching the particulars of gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting, or denying the grace of règeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which are intended alſo by the decrees of predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For albeit God intends not to beſtow ſalvation on any, but upon condition of faith; nor damnation on any, but upon condition of finall impenitency and infidelity. Yet God intends not to beſtow the grace of regeneration on ſome for the curing of their naturall infidelity and impenitency. Nor to leave the ſame infidelity and impenitency uncured in others, by denying the ſame grace of regeneration unto them. This I ſay God doth not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56120:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>
intend to bring to paſſe upon any condition; For if he ſhould, then grace ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred according unto works, which was condemned in the Synod of Paleſtine and all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in divers Synods, and Councells againſt the Pelagians. So that albeit God proceeds according to a law in beſtowing ſalvation, and inflicting damnation; yet he proceeds ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to no law, in giving or denying the grace of regeneration for the curing of our naturall corruption; but merely according to the pleaſure of his will, as the Apoſtle te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies ſaying, <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.</hi> And if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring and denying of this grace be abſolute; how much more are the decrees hereof to be accounted moſt abſolute? And conſequently that one man is delivered from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his ſins, whether originall or habituall; another is not, but ſtill continueth under the power of them; This I ſay, doth, &amp; muſt needs come to paſſe by vertue of Gods abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute decrees. Yet no abſolute neceſſity followeth hereupon. Firſt becauſe no greater ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity then that which is abſolute can be attributed to the exiſtence and continuance of God himſelfe. Secondly God did abſolutely decree to make the world; yet no wiſe man was ever known to affirme that the worlds exiſtence was, and is by abſolute neceſſity. In like ſort, God did abſolutely decree, that <hi>Ioſiah</hi> ſhould burne the Prophets bones, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Altar; That <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhould <hi>build his Citty and let goe his captives;</hi> That <hi>no man ſhould deſire the Iſraelites land, when they ſhould come to appeare before the Lord their God thrice in the yeare;</hi> That <hi>God would circumciſe their hearts, and the hearts of their children to love the Lord their God withall their heart, and with all their ſoule. To put his feare in their hearts, that they ſhould never depart away from him; To cauſe them to walke in his ſtatutes and judgments to doe them. To worke in them both the will and the deed, according to his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> Yea <hi>to worke in them every thing that is pleaſing in his ſight through Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note place="margin">1 <hi>King:</hi> 13. 2. <hi>Eſ:</hi> 45. 13. <hi>Ex,</hi> 34. 24.</note>

                        <p>So that with <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> though we are ready to concurre in denying deſtiny, which as before we heard out of him was a neceſſity derived from the ſtarres; yet with <hi>Auſtin</hi> we may ſtill hold that the wills of men need not to be exempted from all neceſſity, to maintaine the liberty thereof, and he gives inſtance in ſuch a neceſſity as whereby we ſay, <hi>It moſt needs be that ſuch a thing come to paſſe,</hi> as no way prejudiciall to man's liberty. And <hi>Arminius</hi> confeſſeth, that upon ſuppoſition of God's decree it muſt needs be that the Souldiers ſhould abſtaine from the breaking of Chriſt's bones; yet I nothing doubt, but this action was as as freely performed by them, as any other. For albeit a thing muſt needs come to paſſe which God hath decreed to come to paſſe, yet it is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to come to paſſe neceſſarily or freely; which alſo God determines according to the nature of the things themſelves; namely that neceſſary things ſhall come to paſſe neceſſarily, and contingent things contingently. And to this purpoſe he hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red different Agents, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> obſerveth ſome neceſſary working neceſſarily, ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent <note place="margin">

Still this Author harpes upon the ſame ſtring imputing unto us, that we make the whole Circle af a man's life a mere deſtiny; his meaning is that we take away all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which is moſt untrue. As for deſtiny it is well knowne as before I have ſhewed that this was the uſuall crimination, which the Pelagians caſt upon the doctrine of St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> and that, becauſe he maintained that grace was not given according unto man's workes. And what was <hi>Auſtin's</hi> anſwer hereunto, I have ſhewed before: <hi>Si cui voluntatem omnipotentis Dei Fati nomine placet nuncupari, profanas verborum novita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes evitamus, ſed de verbis contendere non amamus, If men pleaſe to call the will of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God by the name of deſtiny; we avoid profane novelties of words, but we doe not</hi>

                           <hi>love to wrangle about words.</hi> For God to worke us to faith, to repentance, to every good worke; yea to the very will and the deed, and that according to his good pleaſure (for which we have expreſſe Scripture, both in the old and new Teſtament, as earſt I ſhewed) &amp; abſolutely to decree this is to make the whole circle of man's like, as touching good courſes, but a mere deſtiny, if we believe this Divine; whereas if this be decreed to be done conditionally, then grace muſt be conferred according to works, which is as true Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagianiſme, as ever dropt from the mouth of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> &amp; which himſelfe was ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>etimes dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven torenounce yet this Pelagianiſme is the only true divinity, if we believe this Author. Againe if <hi>non aliquid fit niſi omnipotens fieri velit, Not any thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es to paſſe, unleſſe God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty will have it come to paſſe;</hi> whether good or evill; which was ſometimes delivered by <hi>Auſtin;</hi> and of late profeſſed by the Church of Ireland in the dayes of King James, <hi>this is to make the whole Circle of man's life a mere Deſtiny;</hi> if this Author be of any credit ſo farre as to make his words to be received as Oracles; yet God's word is expreſſe from the unanimous conſent of the Apoſtles, that <hi>both Herod &amp; Pontius-Pilate, wih the Gentiles and people of Iſrael were gathered together againſt the holy Son of God to do what God's hand &amp; God's counſell had before determined to be done:</hi> Yet were they gathered together to doe ſuch acts, as more facinorous were never known to be done ſince the world beganne: And if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this Author, all this came to paſſe by meere deſtiny: And if this be to come to paſſe by meere deſtiny, why ſhould we not believe it? Have we better or more compleate te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony for ought throughout the whole booke of God, then for this? All things that come to paſſe muſt needs be the iſſues of the divine decree; not only ſuch things as come to paſſe neceſſarily, by neceſſary Agents working neceſſarily; but even ſuch things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as come to paſſe freely, by free agents working contingently, and freely, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath proved and <hi>Auſtin</hi> and the Church of Ireland acknowledged, and the word of God hath juſtified, and cleare reaſon demonſtrated, for as much as otherwiſe no future thing could be foreknowne by God from everlaſting. For nothing can be from everlaſting knowne by God as future, unleſſe from everlaſting it were future. But without the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God paſſing upon it, no contingent thing can paſſe out of the condition of a thing merely poſſible (ſuch as it is in it's own nature) into the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a thing future. So that whoſoever denies God's decree to paſſe upon every thing that comes to paſſe throughout the world, muſt therewithall deny the foreknowledge thereof in the mind of God; Let but this Authour avoid this one argument if he can; but he will never an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it while his head is hot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

He that ſayd, <hi>Non ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid fit niſi omnipotens fieri velit, Not any thing comes to paſſe, unleſſe the Almighty will have it come to paſſe,</hi> ſayd alſo that God ſo workes in every creature, as without all prejudice to their own motions. And when the Apoſtle ſaid, that <hi>In God we move,</hi> his meaning was not, that the creature did nothing, or moved not at all. All that followeth is of the ſame ſtampe a fardell of unſhamefaſt untruthes. Belike when God ſaith, <hi>I will cauſe them to walke in my ſtatutes and to doe them,</hi> God cauſed them to doe juſt nothing. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner when the holy Prophet expoſtulates with God in the perſon of the Church after this manner, <hi>Lord why haſt thou cauſed us to erre from thy waies, and hardened our hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy feare,</hi> the meaning is, <hi>why haſt thou cauſed us to doe juſt nothing.</hi> In like manner when God reſtraines offences, he doth it not by his lawes, When he promotes vertue he doth it not by rewards; when he converts ſinners he doth it not by ſermons: when thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands were converted in one day, it was not by the miniſtry of <hi>Peter</hi> and his fellow A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. This Authours meaning ſeemes to be, that unleſſe man converts himſelfe, it is not done by ſermons. But ſee how he overlaſheth; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carrying the matter ſo as if God's decree neceſſitated and overruled all by our opinion; yet moſt abſurdly he exempts from this divine decree man's endeavours. And who ſeeth not that to overrule is to carry the reaſonable creature on to doe contrary to his own will and judgment. For unleſſe he doth toſſe ſtrenuouſlly he can prevaile nothing with any ſober and indifferent Reader. In like ſort to neceſſitate denotes ſuch a motion whereby the creature is carried to doe a thing neceſſailry but this is not <hi>Bradwardines</hi> opinion, who alone amongſt Schoole-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, that I know, uſeth this phraſe of neceſſitating.

But becauſe that phraſe <hi>Neceſſitating,</hi> is not only of an harſh ſound &amp; apt to be taken in a quite contrary ſenſe to that of the Authour's; therefore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther School-Divines, and generally our Divines uſe it not. And how immodeſt a courſe is
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56120:232"/>
this to thinke to choake us with other mens phraſes, and that in a quite contrary ſenſe to that wherein the Authour's take it? And as if he had very ſubſtantially concluded the point, that <hi>lawes doe nothing, rules of religion, and mens endeavours do nothing,</hi> whereas he hath performed no part either of a Philoſopher or of a Divine in all this, but of a mere tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fler; he proceeds to demand why the one are made, the other preſcribed; why men are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to ſome things; and ſcared from the other. He might as well aske what meant King <hi>Hezechiah</hi> to have any care either of his foode or of taking Phyſicke for thoſe 15 yeares which God told him, he had added unto his life? What meant <hi>Paul</hi> to tell the Maſter of the ſhip, that unleſſe the Mariners were detained in the ſhip they could not be ſaved; what meant ſome to truſt to their ſwimming, others to boards &amp; brokempeeces of the ſhip to get to land, when the Lord by his Angell had told him, that he had given him the lives of all that ſailed with him? In the very daies of <hi>Cicero</hi> the Stoicks were acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſuch like arguments made againſt their deſtiny, and knew how readily to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them by diſtinguiſhing between <hi>Fatalia and Confatalia,</hi> as appeares in <hi>Cicero's</hi> book <hi>de Fato,</hi> and <hi>Turnebus</hi> his anſwer to <hi>Ramus</hi> thereupon, more at large. Therefore this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour diſputes not logically, if he did, the vileneſſe of his argumentation would ſoone appeare according to it's proper colours; but carrieth the matter all along in Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call flouriſhes, as if his wit ſerved him for that beſt, whereat I wonder not a little, that he ſhould forſake that wherein his facultie lieth moſt, according to the reputation that goes of him, &amp; truſt to that wherein his beſt dexterity hath been accounted but <hi>inficete.</hi> If our doctrine tends <hi>to the ſubverſion of policy, religion and lawes, ſociety &amp; goverment</hi> In the next place we expect when he will turne ſtarke Atheiſt and profeſſe as much of the word of God, ſeing it is manifeſt our doctrine cheifly is founded upon the word of God even in that which ſounds moſt harſh unto carnall judgment; namely as touching God's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret providence in evill, this Authour not accomodating any anſwer to any one of thoſe places whereupon our doctrine is grounded. And as for God's providence in working us unto holineſſe, his contrary doctrine cannot ſtand without maintaining that Grace is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven according unto mens works; which is expreſly contradictory to the word of God. 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Tit:</hi> 3. 5, and oppoſed by the church of God as the ſowre leaven of Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gianiſme, from the Synod of Paleſtine all along. For aske this Authour wherefore God beſtowes faith upon one &amp; not upon another, &amp; he hath nothing to anſwer, but either by denying plainly, that faith is the gift of God; which hitherto they are not growne ſo impudent as to deny expreſly; though the Remonſtrants in their <hi>Cenſura cenſurae</hi> come ſo farre, as to deny that Chriſt merited faith and regeneration for any man; Or they muſt anſwer that the reaſon hereof is, becauſe the one by ſome act of his or other hath prepared himſelfe for the reception of divine influences, the other hath not. Or in plaine termes as one hath expreſſed it, that God doth worke in us <hi>Credere to believe, modo velimus provided that we will believe.</hi> But doth he not worke alſo the very act of willing? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he doth; <hi>yea every thing that is pleaſing in his ſight.</hi> And how <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 21.</note> doth he worke in us this will? Is it upon condition, that we will? This is the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity whereunto they are driven, ſtill fetching in a priority of mans act to the divine influence, working us to that which is good, yet moſt prepoſterouſly. For what need is there of influence divine to make us to will if of our ſelves we will already? And this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo utterly overthrowes God's preſcience of things future, which can have no true foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation beſides the divine decree. As for <hi>Mathematici</hi> which were baniſhed out of Rome, were thoſe Divines, or Aſtrologers rather? If they ſubjected the event of all things to the influence of the ſtars, ſhall <hi>Auſtin</hi> be blamed or the Church of Ireland for ſubjecting all things to the councell of God's will, and that according to the expreſſe teſtimony of holy Scripture both as touching good and evill; only with this difference; good things to his will of working them, evill things to his will of permitting them. As for <hi>Proſper's</hi> ſaying in the laſt place, we make no contingent things throughout the world, much leſſe the actions of men to come to paſſe unavoidably, no not upon ſuppoſition of God's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; but by vertue of his decree both contingent things come to paſſe contingently, that is with a poſſibility of not comming to paſſe; &amp; free things freely, that is joyned with an active power in the Agent, either to ſuſpend his action; or to doe otherwiſe; as well as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary things come to paſſe neceſſarily. This I ſay we avouch with <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly with him maintaine the root of contingency to be the effectuall will of God. Againe I have often ſhewed that Predeſtination in the phraſe of the Antients is only of ſuch things as God decreed to bring to paſſe by his effection; notwithſtanding this, <hi>Auſtin</hi> was bold to profeſſe, that <hi>not any thing came to paſſe unleſſe God would have it come</hi>

For firſt I make no mention (in that fourth <hi>Digreſ</hi> of mine in the matter of predeſtination) of the Synod of Dort; neither indeed were they the Objects of my thoughts in this particular. <note place="margin">

In the firſt chapter I make anſwer to <hi>Mr. Elnathan Parre</hi> in an Engliſh tract of his, wherein he deales upon this argument. In the ſecond <hi>chap:</hi> I deale with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that make choice of the lower way; becauſe it ſeemes to be the eaſieſt way, which I expreſſe in the very words of Mr. Doctor <hi>Abbats,</hi> Biſhop of Sarisbury ere he died, and I conceived that indeed this motive prevailed with moſt; and therefore I thought good ſo much the more throughly to diſcuſſe that.

This, <hi>in that opinion concerning the Maſſe of mankind not yet created, all paſſages are intricate, perplext, and intangled with infinite difficulties; but in the opinion concerning the Maſſe corrupt, all things are cleare.</hi> 2. This, that in this other opinion, all things are moſt plainly found to agree both with the authority of Scriptures, and with the judgment of antiquity. Now after I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to diſcover the inſufficiency of this plea in the ſecond and third chapter of that fourth <hi>Digreſſion</hi> in the matter of predeſtination. In the fourth chapter I propoſe mine own judgment concerning the true benefit of this way in making the corrupt maſſe of mankind the object of election and reprobation; not the judgment of others, as this Authour carrieth the matter; but mine own judgment. For thus I beginne. <hi>Ad extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, vis liberè pronuntiem, quid unicè proficiatur ex hac noſtrá praedeſtinationis Objecti ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae temperatione. Dicàm igitur quid ſentiam. Hinc nimirum efficitur ut à lapſu primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum parentum, decreto praedeſtinationis ſubjiciendo &amp; ſubordinando liberemur huic unicè pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſum eſſe, ab iſtius quaſi mediae &amp; temperatioris opinionis aſſertioribus mihi pluſquam proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile, aut veriſimile videtur, ne ſcililicet alias peccatum fieri ſtatueretur, decernente Deo, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam medium ad fines à Deo, in praedeſtinatione ſibi praeſtitutos accommodatum; unde etiam quàm author peccati conſtituendus ſit, nullâ ſolidâ ratione explicari poſſe videtur. In the laſt place, will you give me leave freely to profeſſe, what we profic by thus tempering our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion touching the object of predeſtination? I will therefore deliver what I thinke.</hi> So that herein I purpoſe mine own opinion only, not the opinion of others. <hi>Herehence thus we gaine that we are freed from ſubjecting and ſubordinating man's fall unto God's decree of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination. It ſeemes to me more then probable or likely, that the maintainers of this middle and temperate openion doe provide only againſt this inconvenience;</hi> (that is their way doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed provide againſt this, and againſt no other inconvenience in my opinion) to wit, <hi>leaſt otherwiſe the ſinne of Adam ſhould be ſaid to come to paſſe God willing it, as a meanes conducing to thoſe ends which God intended in predeſtination; from whence it followes as it ſeemes, that it cannot be explicated by any ſolid reaſon that God is not made the Authour of ſinne.</hi> All which is delivered by me as my opinion, conceiving that others thinke ſo too; namely not that God is <hi>hereby made the Authour and principall cauſe of ſinne;</hi> but that the contrary cannot be explicated by any ſolid reaſon. Now <hi>Cajetan</hi> confeſſeth as much, namely that in theſe myſteries, all the diſtinctions that are uſed, doe not <hi>quietare intellectum, ſatisfie the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;</hi>
                           <pb n="135" facs="tcp:56120:233" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and therefore <hi>he doth captivate his owne into the obedience of faith.</hi> And <hi>Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> juſtifies him in this, profeſſing herein that he ſpeakes <hi>doctiſſimè &amp; piiſſimè, moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and holyly.</hi> And in a peculiar diſputation he maintaines that the miſtery of Gods providence and predeſtination, ſtanding with the liberty of our wills, is incomprehenſible by us in this world. Laſtly, conſider, this is delivered only of the firſt ſinne of our firſt parents, which this authour perverts moſt ſhamefully, when he avoucheth that I ſhould acknowledge our Divines, many of them, to embrace this way to avoyd the imputation of making God the principall cauſe, not of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne alone, but of ſinne in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt number of men. And to confeſſe a truth, if ſinne be made the meanes for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of the ends which God intends in predeſtination, undoubtedly God himſelfe ſhould be the authour of ſinne. For whoſoever intends any end, he, and none but he, muſt be authour in working the meanes which tend to this end. Therefore I ſaid, only that in this caſe, <hi>It ſeemes</hi> that the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> was intended by God as the meanes; Whereas in truth and upon due conſideration it appeares that not the creatures ſinne, but Gods permiſſion of the creatures ſinne, is the meanes whereby God brings to paſſe his glorious ends. Yet not the permiſſion of ſinne alone, but joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the pardoning of it, and ſaving his elect in deſpight of it, is the compleat meanes (together with the procuring of Chriſts merits) for the manifeſtation of Gods glory in the way of mercy; And in like manner, not the permitting of ſinne alone, but joyned with the puniſhment of it, is the compleat meanes for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of Gods glory in the way of juſtice vindicative, which in Scripture phraſe is called, <hi>the declaration of his wrath.</hi> And whereas I ſaid that hereby it ſeemed that it could not by any ſound reaſon be manifeſted, that God was not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour <note place="margin">Rom: 9. 22.</note> of ſinne, by the firſt way, this Authour avoucheth of the defenders of the lower way which ſeemes moſt temperate, <hi>that from their concluſions it followeth evidently, that of all the ſinnes of Reprobates, which are the greateſt number by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degrees, God is the true and principall Authour.</hi> Obſerve, <hi>this</hi> (he ſayth) <hi>followeth evidently from their concluſions;</hi> and forthwith he tells us that he <hi>thinks</hi> ſo, or, to his thinking, it doth ſo. And why is he not the Authour of all the ſinnes of the elect alſo? whereas originall ſinne continues in them alſo, they carry about them <hi>a body of death,</hi> and have cauſe to complaine, of <hi>a</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note>

But let us examine how well he makes good that which he affirmes of the ſinnes of the Reprobate, that God is made the Authour of them by our <note place="margin">Cornel: in Ep: ad Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> c. 9. 18.</note> doctrine, of Reprobation. I find that <hi>Cornelius a Lapide a Ieſuite</hi> ſhapes <hi>Calvines</hi> doctrine of election and Reprobation, this lower way, and imputes unto him that from Reprobation, according to his doctrine, <hi>in Reprobis manat cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus &amp; neceſſarius lapſus in peccata quaelibet, A certaine and neceſſary falling into all manner of ſinnes, doth flow in Reprobates.</hi> But not from theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples mentioned by this Authour, but rather from two other principles. The 1. that God deſtinated Reprobates to everlaſting puniſhment, as to their end; and unto ſinnes, as to the meanes thereof. The 2. is that man doth <hi>nothing freely in negotio damnationis ſuae; but that in all things he is driven of God, as a bowle by him that throwes it, as an hatchet by him that hewes with it, and as Clay is moved by the Potter, whom he cannot reſiſt.</hi> This he imputes, to the defenders of Reprobation the lower way, and particularly to <hi>Calvin.</hi> This <hi>Cornelius</hi> denyes not, for ought I know, that by the juſt judgement of God, though executed according to his will and pleaſure, hath brought all men forth into the world in originall ſinne, or that any man can be recovered out of it whiles he lives in this world. And as for theſe two concluſions which he imputes to <hi>Calvin:</hi> as they are falſe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo they are as falſely charged upon <hi>Calvin. Haec loquendi ratio, nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam</hi>

                           <hi>apud me occurret, finem creationis eſſe aeternum interitum. Calvin</hi> expreſly denyes, that God creates any man to this end, that he may damne him; Neither is ſinne any meanes whereby God brings a man to damnation, but the permiſſion of ſinne is Gods meanes, and that together with damning for ſinne, is the compleate meanes, whereby God brings to paſſe his end concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56120:234"/>
Reprobates, which is the manifeſtation of his glory in the way of vindicative juſtice, called his wrath upon thoſe Reprobates; and in the way of mercy upon his elect veſſells of mercy, whom he hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto glory, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> plainely teacheth us. The other principle which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudes upon <hi>Calvin,</hi> is as falſe, and as falſely layd to his charge. In good actions he <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 22. 23.</note> grants the elect are ſo caryed to that which is good, as not freely. For he takes Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to conſiſt in an indifferency to do that which is good, or no; wherein I willingly confeſſe he is in an errour; but that reprobates do not that evill freely, which they do, is no where affirmed by <hi>Calvin</hi> that I know nor by any learned or ſober Divine. For albeit we all concurre in this with <hi>Bernard,</hi> that no naturall man hath <hi>libertatem a peccato, liberty to keep himſelfe from ſinne:</hi> Yet that he is carryed into this or that particular ſinne, we all confeſſe it is done freely. And the reaſon is evident, drawen from the difference betweene gracious actions, and ſinfull actions. Every gracious action is ſupernaturall, either as touching the ſubſtance of the act, ſuch as are the acts of faith, hope, and love; or as touching the manner of performing them, ſuch as are all vertuous actions, which are not acceptable unto God, unleſſe they flow from the former principles, faith, hope, and love: Hereupon there is ſome colour, that ſuch are not performed freely; but there is no ſuch colour, as if man were not free in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming actions vitious; conſidering that all vitious actions are naturall actions, none of them ſupernaturall. And ſurely every naturall man as he hath power to performe any action naturall; ſo hath he power to abſtaine from it. But proceed we along with our preſent Authour.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The firſt doctrine, that he obtrudes upon us, is ſuch, that I little thought there had beene any difference betweene him and us thereabouts, conſiſting of two particulars. 1. The one, that God brings all men forth into the world in the corrupt maſſe, or in the ſtate of originall ſinne.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The other, that man, in the ſtate of originall ſinne or naturall corruption de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd of the ſpirit of regeneration, is under the ſervitude of ſinne, hath no liberty from it. Now in theſe particulars I could not imagine that this Authour differed from us, unleſſe with <hi>Pelagius</hi> he entertaines an affection to deny originall ſinne. For if all men be borne in originall ſinne, ſeing it is God that <hi>takes us out of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe,</hi> and by whom we are brought forth into this world, it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, I ſhould thinke, that God bringeth all men forth into the world, in origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne. As for the ſecond, Doctor <hi>Potter</hi> confeſſeth it as the doctrine of the Church of England, that man in ſtate of nature <hi>hath no liberty from ſinne.</hi> It is true, this liberty he diſtinguiſheth from that liberty, which is called, <hi>liberty from neceſſity,</hi> which he grants to a naturall man; to whom he denyes the former, which cannot ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction. For if a man hath no liberty from ſinne he muſt needs ſinne. And therefore Doctor <hi>Fulke</hi> upon the Remiſh Teſtament doth uſually diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene liberty from ſinne, and liberty from coaction. And both <hi>Arminius</hi> and <hi>Corvinus</hi> confeſſe that by the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> all men are caſt upon a neceſſity of ſinning, though God be ready to deliver us from this neceſſity of ſinning upon reaſonable termes to be performed on mans part, which latter doctrine we utterly renounce as manifeſtly brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the ſpirit of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> in a particular generally condemned in the Church of God, namely, <hi>that grace is conferred according to works or merits.</hi> This makes me conceive that this Authour carryeth himſelfe cunningly in the propoſition of this doctrine which he imputes unto us, and that he hath a reach more then every one is aware of. And indeed the phraſe he uſeth <hi>of bringing men into an eſtate,</hi> is very harſh, though applyed to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> our firſt parents, much more applyed to their race and poſterity. For albeit <hi>Adam</hi> was created in a better ſtate, and afterwards brought into the ſtate of ſinne, and bondage of corruption: yet what ſiniſter judgement moved this Authour to impute this unto God, rather then to <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe? what if God tooke his holy ſpirit from them upon their fall, whereupon they found themſelves naked and were aſhamed? was it not juſt with God to do ſo? Doth not M. Hord profeſſe, that it were juſt with God to damne all for originall ſinne, if he would; which doctrine was delivered by this Authour in his Lectures at Magdalen Hall, my ſelfe being an hearer, and a taker of notes from him, upon this very argument. But it may be this is to be accounted amongſt the errours of his youth, miſtaking <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermine,</hi> which now he is to wiſe to correct in his age. Who brings malefactors to the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56120:234"/>
Gallowes, is it the Judge or Sheriffe, and not their ſins rather? Yet this, though abſurd enough, ſatisfies him not, but withall he adds that God doth this of his own will and pleaſure which phraſe is prone to worke a perſwaſion in the Reader, that hereby is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>ed that God brought not man in this ſtate in the way of juſtice for his ſinne, but merely of his own will or pleaſure; But what Divine of ours was ever known to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any ſuch prodigious aſſertion? Who can deny but that the Judge condemnes a malefactor unto death, &amp; Sheriffe takes order to execute him. Now if queſtion be made why ſuch a man be hanged, will any wiſe man referre this to the <hi>will and pleaſure of the Iudge or Sheriffe,</hi> and not rather to the malefactours deſerts? In like ſort it is God that condemnes a man, and inflicts eternall puniſhment upon him, but is there any colour to ſay that <hi>he doth this of his will and pleaſure,</hi> and not rather that he doth it in the way of juſtice provoked thereunto by mens ſinnes? Laſtly when it is ſaid that God brought him into the ſtate of corruption, who would not thinke that thereby were meant that God was the poſitive Authour of this corruption? whereas it is apparent that man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe averted himſelfe voluntarily and freely from God, the unchangable good; and converted himſelfe unto the creature, which is but a changeable good; And God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon taking his Spirit from him and that moſt juſtly; left him where he found him, and that irrecoverably, ſave by the grace of regeneration. Yet this phraſe is more harſh apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the race &amp; poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> in whoſe production he hath no other hand, then that which neceſſarily belongs unto him, as the Authour of nature, namely, the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them, and faſhioning of them in the wombe, and bringing them forth into the light of this world. If from a leprous Sire there ſprings a leprous fruit, ſhoud this ſeeme ſtrange? We all derive our nature from <hi>Adam</hi> fallen from God, and converted unto the creature, and bereaved of God's Spirit moſt juſtly for his tranſgreſſion; why ſhould it ſeeme ſtrange then, that our natures ſhould be no better then <hi>Adam's</hi> was after his fall? It is true the propagation of originall ſinne, hath alwaies been accounted of a myſterious nature, as touching the manner of it, and very ſtrange and odde conceits have been entertained hereabouts; Some ſaying that the ſoule is derived from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents a ſtrange conceite even in Philoſophy not only in peculiar reference unto the ſoule reaſonable; but generally I find Philoſophers have entertained peculiar contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about <hi>Datores formarum,</hi> in a more generall way. Others have thought that the ſoule is defiled by the body, as a ſweet and ſoveraigne oyle may be corrupted by a naughty boxe; which is worſe then the former, no marvaile that a bodily thing ſhould corrupt that which is bodily; but that a body ſhould corrupt the ſoule, the one being corporall the other ſpirituall is beyond comprehenſion: Farre more probable or rather without queſtion that the ſoule rather corrupts the body. The poſitive inclination un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to evill is that which hath troubled all and made ſome conceive that it could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed immediatly from God; For if ſo, then ſurely not <hi>impura,</hi> but <hi>pura.</hi> Others and particularly <hi>Arimininſis,</hi> as remember, that the corruption came from the breath of the ſerpent, others as Johannes Bicconius; that the ſoule though comming pure from God yet knit unto the body, the Lord for the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> gives it over to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Satan, who as an univerſall cauſe ſupplies the place of a particular cauſe in the poſitive corrupting of it. This at the firſt ſeemed unto me as very ſingular, ſo a very ſtrange adventure, and that <hi>Baccorius</hi> is a very rare School-man and more uſed in the <hi>Arabian</hi> philoſophy then all the reſt, ſave ſuch as were of his own profeſſion.

And I find him ſometimes congratulating his good fortunes in finding that this <hi>Iohannes Bacconius</hi> was in ſome particulars of his mind, he doth not ſay, he learnt it of him. But I know no School Divine comparable to him for depth of philoſophicall ſpeculations; yet am I not of his mind in the point of originall ſinne. I willingly confeſſe it is one of the three points wherein ſometimes I perſwaded my ſelfe I never ſhould be ſatiſfied in this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that which moſt troubled me was the poſitive nature of it. Wherin <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetan</hi> is thought to diſcourſe ſtrangely alſo, even to the palate of <hi>Pontificians;</hi> And <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> his definit on of it, calling it, <hi>Habitus corruptus;</hi> hath coſt me no ſmall paines in the diſcuſſion thereof. At length I conceive there is no greate cauſe of ſo much pudder to be made about it, ſave that certaine prejudices which we lay for grounds doe caſt us there upon. The harmony of man's nature in all parts, excepting
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56120:235"/>
it's due ſubjection unto God, I willingly confeſſe was naturall, but whether it did <hi>profluere ex principiis naturae,</hi> either <hi>ſpecificae,</hi> or <hi>individualis,</hi> or was cauſed and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned while <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in his integrity by the ſpeciall hand of God's providence; as ſome School-men profeſſe finding the difficultie of maintaining the former (which yet might be conſequent naturally to it's due ſubjection unto God for ought I ſee yet to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) I diſpute not. But as for it's due ſubjection unto God in faith and love, and ſuch a love as joyned with the contempt of it ſelfe; I have reaſon to conceive that this was not naturall, as flowing from the principles of nature either ſpecificall or individuall, though this latter I heard ſometimes maintained publiquely in the Univerſity, but rather wrought in man in his creation by vertue of ſupernaturall grace, and the holy Ghoſt's reſidence in him; which ſupernaturall grace, and holy Ghoſt's reſidence had been naturall unto all his poſterity, had <hi>Adam</hi> continued in his integrity. I call it naturall in as much as it had deſcended unto all his poſterity, after the manner of an inheritance naturall. But <hi>Adam</hi> by his tranſgreſſion forfeited this bleſſed condition, not to himſelfe only, but to all his poſterity, being juſtly bereaved of the Spirit of God, and left by the Lord where he found him; <hi>averted à bono incommutabili, and converted ad bonum communicabile</hi> in an inordinate manner, which converſion to the creature is poſitive, and not evill in it ſelfe, but as it is joyned with averſion from God; &amp; this makes it an inordinate converſion to the creature, not for Gods ſake, that it is not out of the love of God to the contempt of himſelfe, which is the character of a child of God but out of the love of himſelfe to the contept of God, which is the charecter of a child of this this world. So that as originall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes whereunto we are reſtored in part by the grace of regeneration, tranſcends all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall vertues; ſo originall ſin tranſcends all morall vices &amp; is found in the moſt vertuous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt heathen men (of whom ſome have been very renowned in this kind, &amp; great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their paſſions) as well as amongſt the moſt vicious. And it is hard to reſolve who have been greateſt enimies to the truth of God and holineſſe; and generally to the holy waies of God, whether the moſt vertuous or the moſt vitious among heathen men. I come to his ſecond poſition, which he caſts upon us, as diſſenting therein from himſelfe; and it is this, <hi>That God leaves the Reprobates irrecoverably in it.</hi> Now on this point I would gladly know his contrary Tenet in what ſenſe it proceeds, namely, That Reprobates are not left irrecoverably in originall ſinne, or in ſuch ſtate wherein they cannot avoid ſinne. For I cannot comprehend his meaning herein. But it was wont to be ſaid of <hi>Africa</hi> that, <hi>ſemper aliquid apportat novi, alwaies it brings forth ſome new monſter in courſe of nature.</hi> So men of this Authour's ſpirit: are alwaies bringing forth ſome new monſter in Divinity. For what thinks he? was ever any Reprobate recovered out of originall ſin? Nay was ever any child of God recovered out of it while he lived upon the face of the earth? Or doth he thinke himſelfe recovered out of it, or is it in his power to avoid it? Perhaps he will ſay though he cannot avoid ſin originall, yet he can avoid ſin actuall; and ſo not only the children of God may if they will, but even Reprobates alſo. But what? may they avoid all ſinne, or ſome only? What one of our Divines denies that a Reprobate hath power to avoid fornication? We ſee heathens doe avoid: it Or ſtealth? For heathens doe ſo. Or murther? Even heathens have been found very morall and that generally. But this we ſay; All men in the ſtate of nature, whether they doe good as touching the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the act; yet they doe it not in a gracious manner; Or whether they abſtaine from that which is evill, they doe not abſtaine from it in a gracious manner; nor can doe. Nay ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> who ever lived free from ſinne, the Son of God only exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted? Doth notholy <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſe of himſelfe ſaying, <hi>I doe not the good that I would, but the evill that I would not, that doe I. To will is preſent with me, but I find not to performe: hat which is good.</hi> And if God may juſtly damne all for ſinne originall as <hi>Mr. Hoord</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes, why may not God leave all irrecoverably in it; and that juſtly? So that herein I find my ſelfe in a brake, not can deviſe with my ſelfe in what tollerable or colourable ſenſe he can affirme, that Reprobates are not left irrecoverably in the ſtate of originall ſinne; or in ſuch a ſtate, in which <hi>they cannot avoid ſinne;</hi> I ſay in what ſenſe he can deliver this different from us, I cannot deviſe. For we willingly grant that there is no particular actuall ſinne from which a Reprobate hath not power to abſtaine, though he cannot ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from it in a gracious manner without grace, and that grace we account the grace of regeneration; which is a ſupernaturall principle of gracious actions, both as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith in God, and the love of God, to the contempt of our ſelves. Now I gueſſe his meaning is, that no Reprobate is ſo left and abandoned in originall ſinne, but that God gives him grace to believe if he will, to repent if he will, to love God if he will, &amp; that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56120:235"/>
all things. I gueſſe, I ſay, that this is his meaning; but I would have him expreſſe it, that I might ſee it under his hand. For till then I find noe apparent difference between him &amp; us, as touching theſe two principles from whence he deduceth, that God is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made <hi>The principall cauſe of ſin in the greateſt number of men.</hi> And if once he deliver himſelfe fairely, and comes to this, the iſſue of the queſtion to be debated between us will be faire and cleare; namely about this their univerſall grace, <hi>whether all men elect and Reprobate by vertue of ſupernaturall grace given unto them, have power to beleive if they will, repent if they will.</hi> And againſt this I will diſpute after this manner. Firſt in all this there is no difference between us excepting that this power is ſaid to be <hi>wrought in man by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall grace.</hi> For we ſay with <hi>Auſtin Deo credere, &amp; ab amore temporalium ad divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>

The will of God's children is ſo infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ed by the Holy Ghoſt, that therefore they are able to do good, becauſe they have a will to it in ſuch a manner</hi> (that is with ſuch fervency and eagernes) <hi>therefore they have a will to it in ſuch a manner, becauſe God ſo workes, as to make them willing;</hi> to wit, in ſuch a manner. Secondly we ſay that to believe if a man will, to repent if he will is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted nature, rather then grace, which I prove thus. Supernaturall grace is not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to a morall vertue, but a morall vertue doth more then leave a man indifferent to doe vertuouſly if he will; For it inclines the will to vertuous courſes only, and not viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; Like as vice inclines the will only to vicious courſes, and not to vertuous; how much more doth ſupernaturall grace not leave a man indifferent to doe good if he will; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines the will only to ſuch things as are pleaſing unto God, and not to things diſpleaſing unto him. Againe to have power to believe if we will, is to have power to have faith if we will; But this <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath expreſſely profeſſed to belong to the nature of man, in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio fró the grace of the faithfull. <hi>Poſſe fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> habere, ſicut poſſe charitate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> habere naturae eſt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;</hi>

I anſwer, <hi>Auſtin</hi> there ſpeakes of the grace that <hi>Adam</hi> had before his fall, which was this, <hi>poſſe ſi velit to abſtaine from eating the forbidden fruit.</hi> And this firſt grace is called grace in this reſpect, that there was in <hi>Adam</hi> no fleſh luſting againſt the Spirit; So that if <hi>Adam</hi> had but a will to abſtaine, he ſhould have no cauſe to complaine as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>To will is preſent with me, but I find no meanes to performe that which is good;</hi> Now ſuch a <hi>poſſe ſi velit</hi> is not found in any man now a daies, no not in the regenerate. But all men that have a will to doe good by the grace of God, have withall a <hi>poſſe ſecundum quid, a power in part a weake power;</hi> but this is not ſufficient to denominate them ſimply able to doe that which is good; unleſſe the love of God be increaſed in them, ſo as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the will of the fleſh luſting againſt the ſpirit, as I have repreſented <hi>Auſtin</hi> thus expounding it. Thirdly whether tends this, that all men have power to believe if they will, to repent if they will? But to maintaine that faith and repentance are not the gifts of God, beſtowed of his free grace on whom he will; but that they are the workes of man's free will, directly contradictory to the word of God expreſly profeſſing that <hi>faith is the gift of God, and that not of our ſelves.</hi> So repentance is the gift of God; yea that it is God who worketh in us that which is <hi>pleaſing in his ſight through Jeſus Chriſt.

If all reprobates have power to believe and repent if they will, and ſo conſequently to perſevere if they will; how comes it to paſſe that not one of them doth believe, repent, and perſevere; ſeing it is confeſt among Philoſophers that ſuch contingents as depend upon the free will of man, are equally propendent on either ſide to paſſe as often one way, as the other. But proceed we along with this Authour.</p>
                        <p n="1">1.

Yet doe not we ſay, but that it is in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of any man to abſtaine from any particular ſinne, it being but a naturall act, and a man hath free power to performe any naturall act or to abſtaine from it; ſo farre forth as to become very vertuous, as much as any man among the heathen, many of whom have been renowned for vertuous converſation. <hi>Calvin</hi> in the paſſages here alleadged hath nothing concerning, either the guilt of <hi>Adam's</hi> tranſgreſſion paſſing upon his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or the corruption derived therehence unto them; but only of their <hi>falling from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſalvation</hi> in the one; that <hi>all are enthralled to eternall death</hi> in the other; And that <hi>Adam's</hi> fall hath enwrapped all in eternall death in the third.

And that the corruption conſequent is derived to us only by propagation, I thinke it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt amongſt all, who concurre not with <hi>Pelagius</hi> in maintaining that it is derived unto us by imitation, and ſo only. Yet notwithſtanding it cannot be denied, but that God might have cauſed the puniſhment of <hi>Adam's</hi> ſinne to reſt upon himſelfe only, and immediately deſtroyed him and created another, and propagated mankind from him. Yea ſuppoſing his ordinance of propagating mankind from him, yet God of his mercy might have derived others from him of his mere grace indued with the holy Ghoſt, if it had pleaſed him; like as whom he juſtly damnes for ſinne, he might have cauſed them to have lived one yeare or more longer, and in that time beſtowed the ſpirit of grace upon them to break off their ſins by repentance, and from grace tranſlated into glory. As for the reaſons here mentioned by <hi>Mr. Maſon</hi> to juſtifie that which my ſelfe and others have delivered on the former point, I have noe cauſe to juſtifie, becauſe they proceed from a falſe ground, ſuppoſing that the reaſon of this imputation of <hi>Adam's</hi> ſinne, and propagation of his corruption unto all his poſterity, is <hi>merely</hi> built upon this foundation that we were in <hi>Adam's</hi> loynes when he ſinned, which is untrue.</p>

1 In his firſt reaſon he doth miſerably overlaſh; for we could not be guilty of all the ſinnes which were committed by <hi>Adam</hi> from his fall to his lifes end, no not upon the ground whereon this Authour builds; ſo long we were not in his Ioynes, nor any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then till he begat <hi>Seth;</hi> for from <hi>Seth</hi> ſprang <hi>Noah,</hi> and we all from him. Neither is it credible that <hi>Adam</hi> continued to beget children till the laſt yeare, and month, and day of his life. Indeed we no where read that we are guilty of any other of his ſinnes, beſides the firſt; The reaſon whereof ſhall be given in the next place.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Therefore I ſay, in anſwer unto them both, that the ground of imputing <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne unto his poſterity, is not onely becauſe we were in <hi>Adams</hi> Ioynes, but becauſe the firſt ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> was it, that bereaved his nature of Gods image; and ſo brought corruption upon himſelfe by <hi>an averſion from the Creator and unchangable good, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion unto the Creature,</hi> wherein the Lord left him, bereaving him of his ſpirit; and this nature, by this ſinne alone ſo corrupt, is the fountaine of all our natures; Like as if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood, of the ſame fountaine of integrity we had all received incorrupt natures; ſo that the like cannot be ſaid of any other ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> afterwards committed by him, nor of the ſinne of any other our progenitours ſucceding him. For as for the wicked, they have no ſuch ſpirit of God to looſe; And as for the Godly, they have indeed the ſpirit of God, but ſo as not to be taken from them by the ſinnes committed by them, any more then it was from <hi>David</hi> upon the committing of ſo foule ſinnes in the matter of <hi>Uriah;</hi> neither do any Godly parents propagate their ſtate of grace to their poſterity. And <hi>Aquinas</hi> is ſo bold hereupon as to profeſſe, that, <hi>Impoſſibile eſt, quod aliqua peccata parentum proximorum, vel etiam primi parentis praeter primum, per originem traducantur.</hi>

                           <hi>It is impoſſible that the ſinnes of our immediate parents, or of our firſt parents, beſides the firſt, ſhould be derived unto poſterity by propagation. For, ſayth he, a man generates the ſame with himſelfe in kinde only; not in individuall. And therefore thoſe things, which pertaine to him as a particular perſon, as acts perſonall, he doth not propagate unto his children. Now to the nature of man, ſomthing may pertain naturally, ſomthing by the gift of grace. And this origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall righteouſneſſe as a gift of grace was beſtowed on the whole nature of mankind in our firſt parents, which</hi> Adam <hi>loſt by his firſt ſinne; ſo that like as originall righteouſneſſe had beene propagated to poſterity together with the humane nature, ſo alſo the oppoſite inordination. But as for other actuall ſinnes, either of our firſt parents, or of others, they do not corrupt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man,</hi> as touching that which pertaines to nature, but as touching that which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to his perſon; therefore other ſinnes are not propagated unto poſterity.

                        </q>
                        <p>It is a uſuall courſe with this Authour to lay unto our charge, that God hath immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> decreed this or that; So that if we had ſaid that all this were decreed by God not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably, but mutably, we ſhould not incurre the danger of his diſpleaſure ſo immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and unavoydably as we do. Now to decree not immutably, but mutably, is a phraſe that I no where meet with, but among men of this Authours ſpirit; the congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity whereof I willingly profeſſe, is ſo farre from mine underſtanding, as no phraſe more. If they would in the name of common ſenſe expound themſelves unto us, then we ſhould ſoone conſider what Anſwer we are to give in. We willingly profeſſe, that all Gods decrees are unchangeable, but of decreeing a thing unchangeably, not any of our Divines diſcourſe, that I know of. We ſay that God decreeth ſome things to come to paſſe neceſſarily, and ſome things to come to paſſe contingently; ſo doth <hi>Aquinas:</hi> and we underſtand his language right well, and approve his doctrine in this particular. We willingly confeſſe that as God hath choſen ſome, whom he meanes to deliver from that bondage of ſinne, and <hi>Satan,</hi> whereinto all are caſt by the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam.</hi> And how to deliver them? Surely by beſtowing the ſpirit of grace, and regeneration upon them, ſo to open their eyes and bring them out of darkeneſſe into light, and from the power of <hi>Satan</hi> unto God; In few words by beſtowing faith and repentance upon them. All others he hath from everlaſting determined not to ſhew the like grace and favour unto. For we ſee by experience that to many he gives not faith and repentance. And looke how he carryeth himſelfe towards any perſons in time, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he determined to carry himſelfe from everlaſting. And the Scripture expreſly tels us that even of them that are called, but few are choſen; and conſequently the number of reprobates muſt needs be farre greater, then the number of the elect. Now as many as God hath decreed to deny faith and repentance unto, we hold it impoſſibile for them, upon this ſuppoſition, to be recovered out of the bondage of ſinne and <hi>Satan;</hi> becauſe the Scripture in divers places expreſly tells us, that faith is the gift of God, repentance is the gift of God; and therefore to whomſoever he will not be ſo gracious, as to give faith, and repentance, we judge it a thing impoſſible upon this ſuppoſition, that any of them ſhould believe, ſhould repent. And more then this, as touching every particular here delivered, we account it ſo apparently, teſtified in holy Scripture, that we wonder not a little with what face this Authour can deny it. Nay, we verily believe that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives all theſe as well as we. And the true point of Subſtantiall difference betweene us is conceled by him all along, which is an argument of no ingenuity; but yet I beare with him in following <hi>Lyſanders</hi> counſell, when the Lyons skin will not hold out, to peece it out with a fox skin; leaſt otherwiſe his <hi>Pelagian</hi> tenet would be diſcovered in a moſt palpable and groſſe manner. For undoubtedly he believes that faith is the gift of God; as alſo that it is impoſſible, that they ſhould believe, to whom God will not give faith. But his tenet is, that God is ready and willing to give faith to all, not abſolutely, but conditionally; to wit, in caſe they make themſelves fit for it, by performing ſomewhat on their parts. Now this is as good as in expreſſe termes to profeſſe, that <hi>Grace is conferred according to merits, or according unto workes:</hi> For betweene works and merits in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy there is no difference, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknowledgeth; And in the Epiſtle of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper to <hi>Auſtin</hi> they are taken promiſcuouſly, as of the ſame force and ſignification. Now this doctrine is expreſly contradictory to the word of God. <hi>God hath ſaved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our owne workes but according to his owne purpoſe and grace.</hi> The like we have, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. And in like manner this doctrine hat: beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <note place="margin">2. Tim. 19.</note> in the Church of God, as the ſowre leaven of <hi>Pelagianiſme,</hi> from the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> above 1200 yeares agoe all along; and <hi>Pelagius</hi> himſelfe was driven to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the <hi>Canons</hi> of that <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> wherein <hi>Anathema</hi> was pronounced upon them, that do, or ſhall maintaine, that <hi>Grace is conferred according unto workes.</hi>

If God hath decreed not to beſtow faith upon a man, if he hath not decreed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon him the gift of charity, it is impoſſible, that any worke can be done by ſuch a one proceeding from faith and love, and conſequently ſuch a one hath <hi>no liberty from ſinne,</hi> and that no ſuch liberty is found in a naturall man, in an unregenerate, is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Church by D. <hi>Potters</hi> confeſſion, a Cathedrall Divine, I do not ſay by the conſtant doctrine of D. <hi>Fulke</hi> in his anſwer to the Rhemiſh Teſtament, and if no liberty from ſinne be found in ſuch a one, it followes that ſuch a one remaines under a neceſſity of ſinning, not that every ſinne, whether of lying, ſtealing, whoring, murther, or in any other kind is neceſſarily committed by him; For a naturall man may be as morall as any heathen hath beene, many of whom have beene very famous and renowned in the world for their morality; But whether they are exerciſed in vertuous actions, or in abſtaining from actions vicious, yet ſtill they ſinne, foraſmuch as they neither performe the one, nor abſtaine from the other in a gracious manner, out of faith and love. And therefore <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> was ſomewhere bold to ſtile them <hi>Splendida peccata glorious ſinnes.</hi> For <hi>novimus non officiis ſed finibus diſcernendas eſſe virtutes, Vertues are to be diſcerned not by their offices, but by their ends.</hi> The <hi>Helen</hi> we fight for is nothing but the word of God, and the truth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly contained therein; namely concerning the prerogative of his grace, as effectuall to every good worke, and moſt Freely given to ſome and denyed to others, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to mens workes, according to that of S. <hi>Paul God hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will, he hardneth.</hi> This is a part of Gods ſoveraignty; And it ſtands all true ſubjects upon to maintaine the lawfull Soveraignty of their Princes; how much more doth it become the creature to ſtand for the lawfull prerogative and Soveraignty of his Creator, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when he proceeds herein according to the tenour of Gods word, cleare reaſon and the unanimous conſent of all the orthodoxe in the Church of God clearely oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Pelagius</hi> herein from the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> 1200. yeares agoe to this day.</p>
                        <p>The difference of opinions here feigned by him about the point of Reprobation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our Divines is like the feigning of a knot in a bulruſh. For what is a peremptory denying of grace and glory to ſome men lying in the fall, other then a denyall of that grace and glory, which is prepared in <hi>the decree of election to the ſonnes of God,</hi> though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed neither of them make it a denyall, which is done in time, but rather Gods decree to deny it. For do not the latter Divines maintaine it to be peremptory, as well as the former? For what difference doth he deviſe between a flat denyall, and a peremptory denyall; and as for the latter decree belonging to reprobation here mentioned, namely <hi>a preordination of the man thus left to the torments of hell</hi> do not the latter Divines acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this decree to belong to Reprobation alſo? Only they profeſſe that <hi>God preordaines none to eternall torments in hell but for their ſinnes actuall</hi> as well as originall, of as many as live to ripeneſſe of age. Now I would faine know what Divine of ours maintaines the contrary.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Our Divines in ſaying, Reprobation is, <hi>Decretum quo ſtatuit non miſereri</hi> do manifeſt, that not denying grace, but the decree of denying it, is Reprobation. <hi>Walaeus</hi> ſpeaketh of no common endowments, though that be a truth, which here is attributed unto them; elſe how ſhould they be called common endowments.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If he decrees to leave Reprobates without grace, and conſequently under that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſinning into which all are caſt by the ſinne of <hi>Adam;</hi> it is nothing ſtrange, I thinke that God ſhould accordingly leave them therein; though in a different manner, the Lord proſtituting ſome to their own loſt's and to the power of <hi>Satan,</hi> more then others, and making ſome even by the miniſtery of the Goſpell, <hi>proficere ad exteriorem vitae emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dationem, quo mitius puniantur;</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſome where ſpeaketh. If Gods decree cannot be fruſtrated, as here is avouched; I wonder he ſhould charge us with teaching, that <hi>God decreeth this, or that immutably.</hi> For if he ſhould change any of his decrees, they ſhould undoubtedly be fruſtrated. Indeed we do not ſay, that God decrees Hypotheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to give grace, to wit upon condition, that men will make themſelves fit for it, and for failing herein to deny them grace.

                           <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>(Cauſae cauſae eſt cauſa cauſati) the Cauſe of a cauſe is the cauſe of its effect</hi> (if there be a neceſſary ſubordination betweene the cauſes and the effect) whether it be a cauſe by acts negative, or poſitive. But God is the cheife or ſole cauſe (by their doctrine) of that, which is the neceſſary and immediate cauſe of the ſinnes of reprobates, namely their impotency and want of ſupernaturall grace; therefore he is (by the ſame doctrine) the true and proper cauſe of their ſinnes.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Becauſe <hi>Removens prohibens, </hi> that which withdraweth and withholdeth a thing, which being preſent would hinder an event, is the cauſe of that event. As for example he that cutteth a ſtring in which a ſtone hangs, is the cauſe of the falling of that ſtone; And he that withdraweth a pillar which being put to uphold a houſe; is the true cauſe in mens account of the falling of that houſe. But God by their opinion withholdeth from reprobates that power, which being granted them, might keep the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinne: therefore he becometh a true morall cauſe of their ſinnes, <hi>In whoſe power it is that a thing be not done, to him it is imputed, when it is done,</hi> ſayth <hi>Tertullian, In cuius manu eſt quid ne fiat, ei deputatur, cum iam fit.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It will not ſuffice to ſay that God by withholding grace from reprobates becometh only an <hi>accidentall,</hi>

For a cauſe is then only accidentall in relation to the effect, when the effect is beſide the intention and expectation of the cauſe. For example; Digging in a feild is then an accidentall cauſe of the finding a bag of gold, when that event is neither expected not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the husbandman in digging; But when the event is lookt for, and aymed at, then the cauſe (though it be the cauſe only by withholding the impediment) is not accidentall. As a <hi>Pilot</hi> who withholdeth his care and skill from a ſhip in a ſtorme; foreſeeing that by his neglect the ſhip will be drowned; is not to be reputed an accidentall, but a direct, and proper cauſe of the loſſe of this ſhip. This being ſo it followeth that God by this act and decree of removing and detaining grace ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the avoyding of ſinne, from reprobates, not as one ignorant and careleſſe what will or ſhall follow, but knowing infallibly what miſcheife will follow, and determining preciſely that which doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, viz: their impenitency and damnation, becomes the proper and direct cauſe of their ſinnes.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>That God did bring men into a neceſſity of ſinning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>That he hath left the reprobates under this neceſſity.</hi> Hence he concludes that God is the Author of the reprobates ſins; But this we utterly deny. Therefore this he undertakes to prove by two reaſons.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe the cauſe of the cauſe is the cauſe of its effect, if there be a neceſſary ſubordination betweene the cauſes and the effect. But God is the cheife or ſole cauſe (by their doctrine) of that which is the neceſſary and immediate cauſe of the ſinnes of Reprobates, namely their impotency and want of ſupernaturall grace.</hi> For anſwer whereunto I ſay, firſt begining with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. 1. That the want of ſupernaturall grace is not the immediate cauſe of the ſinnes of Reprobates, nor the cheife cauſe; much leſſe the ſole cauſe. And I prove it evidently. Let inſtance be given in any ſinne committed by a Reprobate; let it be the ſinne of murther, or of fornication, or of theft, or of lying! For if it were, then every reprobate ſhould be guilty of murther, of fornication, of lying, of ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56120:238"/>
For, <hi>poſitâ cauſâ principali &amp; immediatâ ponitur effectus;</hi> Where a principall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate cauſe doth exiſt, there the effect muſt needs exiſt. But it is apparent, that albeit every reprobate doth want ſupernaturall grace, yet every reprobate is not guilty of murther, of fornication, lying, and ſtealing. Secondly, If the want of ſupernaturall grace were the immediate and principall cauſe of all the ſinnes of reprobates; then not only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Reprobate ſhould be guilty of committing all the ſinnes formerly mentioned, but at all times every one of theſe ſinnes ſhould be committed by them; Becauſe at all times they want ſupernaturall grace. And the truth is, every one of theſe ſinnes may be abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from without ſupernaturall grace, and for carnall reſpects: Only without ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall grace they cannot be abſtained from, in a gracious manner; as namely out of faith in God, and love to God. He that hath neither faith nor love cannot abſtaine from theſe vile courſes out of faith and love. In like ſort, heathen men in their generations have beene exceeding vertuous, according to the worlds account of vertue, in modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their paſſions, and ordering their converſation aright one towards another; and all this hath beene performed by them without ſupernaturall grace. Thirdly, The imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cauſe of all their ſinnes rather of the two, is their naturall corruption, whereby they are habitually turned away from God; and converted unto the creature in an inordinate manner. Like as the immediate cauſe <hi>actionis laeſae, of a naturall function of the body imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> is the diſeaſe or infirmity that hath ſeiſed upon ſome part of the body; And the Phyſitian who is able to cure it, and will not; is the cauſe why it continueth uncured: But no wiſe man will ſay, he is the cauſe why this or that member in a ſicke mans body doth not performe its operation as it ſhould. In like manner as touching the vicious actions of the ſoule, the want of ſupernaturall grace is the cauſe, why thoſe vicious actions continue uncured, becauſe God alone by his grace can cure them; but no ſober man that is well in his wits, ſhould ſay that is the cauſe of vicious actions; but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge rather the corruption thereof to be the cauſe of theſe vicious actions. And indeed all morall philoſophy referres the cauſe of every vicious action, unto the vicious habit depraving the will, and inclining it to vicious courſes. Fourthly, Yet farther to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the wildneſſe of this Authours diſcourſe. The vicious habit it ſelfe is not the ſole cauſe; no nor the principall and immediate cauſe of a vicious action in particular. For if it were, then that particular vicious action ſhould alwayes be committed by it; So that an impure perſon ſhould alwayes commit fornication; a Lyar ſhould alwayes lye; a Theife ſhould alwayes ſteale; a Murtheret ſhould alwayes commit murther. For it is a rule generally received, that <hi>the immediate and principall cauſe being exiſtent, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect muſt needs exiſt alſo.</hi> And indeed albeit, <hi>habits,</hi> whether good or evill, <hi>do worke after the manner of nature inclining and ſwaying the will to the accompliſhment of them;</hi> Yet the will of man being a free, and not neceſſary Agent, proceeds not to worke, but according unto judgement and occaſions and opportunityes from without. And albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it a purſer that maintaine himſelfe by robbery hath a faire opportunity offered him to advantage himſelfe to take a purſe; yet if upon conſideration he finds himſelfe too weake to goe through with it, or that he cannot do it ſafely, he will forbeare. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit a vicious habit doth naturally, and neceſſarily incline him to a naughty end, yet in the choice of the meanes conducing to this end, he is free. How much more plainely doth it appeare, that the want of ſupernaturall grace is farre off from being either the ſole cauſe, or the immediate, or the principall cauſe of any ſinne committed by a Reprobate. Rather of the two the inteſtine corruption of the Reprobate is the cauſe of his ſinnes, and the want of grace is the cauſe why this corruption is not cured. Now albeit a Phyſitian may ſinne in not curing a ſicke perſon, when it lyes in his power to cure him: For we are in charity bound to do to others, as we would have others do unto us; yet God is bound to none, <hi>I will ſhew mercy on whom I will ſhew mercy,</hi>

                        <p n="2">2. Obſerve how ſluttiſhly he carryeth himſelfe in the next reaſon taken from <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movens prohibens. His rule proceeds both of withdrawing and withholding a thing which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent would hinder an event.</hi> But he gives inſtance only in withdrawing, as <hi>in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſtring whereon a ſtone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But this Authour contents not himſelfe with conforming the condition of Agents voluntary to the conditions of Agents naturall and neceſſary; but changeth his termes alſo, and puts the phraſs of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56120:239"/>
into the place of the former phraſe, which was withholding. Now it is true God withholds that grace from Reprobates, which he gives to his Elect; but he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes and takes no inward grace from them. Yet this phraſe of withholding is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper; For it ſignifies a forcible reſtraint of that which was going; Whereas God being Maſter of his owne grace, gives it to whom he will, and denyes it to whom he will; For he is bound to none. And is it not lawfull for him to doe what he will with his owne? But albeit he carry himſelfe very ſluttiſhly in oppoſing us, yet I willingly confeſſe he carryeth the matter very clearely in contradicting himſelfe; as when he concludeth, that <hi>God in withholding that power</hi> (that is that grace) <hi>which would keep them from ſinne</hi> (for this alone is our Tenet) <hi>hereby becomes a true morall cauſe of their ſinne.</hi> I ſay, herein he contradicts himſelfe very handſomely. For himſelfe confeſſeth that God could hinder any man from ſinne, but he doth not: And doth it not herehence evidently follow, that God hereby becomes the Authour of ſinne, yea of every ſinne that is committed in the world? But I ſee what he will reply by the face of his diſcourſe, namely this; He ſayth not that God by <hi>withholding that grace which would keep him from ſinne, becomes the Authour of ſinne;</hi> but only by withholding that grace which <hi>might keep him from ſinne.</hi> And indeed ſo he doth; but marke therewithall how ſluttiſhly he carryeth himſelfe in 2 particulars. 1. In deviating from his confirmity to his owne inſtances. For each inſtance given is in ſuch a thing withdrawen whereupon the event abſolutely followeth; and which not being withdrawen the contrary event not only <hi>might be,</hi> but <hi>would be;</hi> as if a ſtring holding a ſtone being not broken, the ſtone not only might be held, but would be held. So if the not beene withdrawen, not only the houſe might have beene held up, but would have pillar had been held up. But upon granting grace he doth not ſay the creature would have beene kept from ſinne, but <hi>might have beene kept from falling into ſinne.</hi> Now what <hi>Leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deimaine</hi> is this? And could he preſume his Reader would prove ſo ſimple and Sottiſh, as not to obſerve this incongruity? 2. He deviates from our tenet. For we do not ſay, that upon granting grace ſupernaturall the creature may abſtaine from ſinne, if he will, but that hereby is wrought in him a will to abſtaine from ſinne, a deſire to do that which is pleaſing in the ſight of God, though not in ſuch perfection, as to worke out all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall corruption that is found within us; but that ſtill there is <hi>ſinne dwelling in us; ſtill there is a fleſh fighting againſt the ſpirit;</hi> Yea, <hi>a law in our members rebelling againſt the law of our mind, and leading us captive to the law of ſinne.</hi> Hence proceed the manifold and dayly ſinnes even of the children of God; but Gods ſpirit is prevalent with them to renew their repentance, even for ſinnes of weakneſſe, and ſinnes of improvidence and inconſiderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and to keep from preſumptuous ſinnes, that they may not prevaile over them; That it may not be ſaid of them, as it was of too many among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, <note place="margin">

                           <hi>Their ſpots are not the ſpots of thy children.</hi> Nay, which is more, conſider; <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> confeſſeth that God doth hinder ſinne in ſuch a manner, as by granting ſuch a grace, <note place="margin">

What therefore? ſhall he be accounted the Authour of ſuch ſinnes. Yet I willingly confeſſe, <hi>Arminius</hi> and this Authour ſhake hands in this, that the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates have ſuch a grace, as whereby they may abſtaine from ſinne, if they will. Yet holy <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſeth of himſelfe, even then, when he was in a better condition (I trowe) then that of Reprobates, to wit, when he wrote the Epiſtle to the Romans, ſaying, <hi>What I would that do I not, but what I hate that do I.</hi> And againe, <hi>To will is preſent with me, but I</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>As for the ſolution which he feignes to himſelfe of his owne argument, by diſtinction of an accidentall cauſe, and a proper and direct cauſe; that is none of ours. This is a gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell of his owne, to delude his reader. God we ſay is the direct and proper cauſe of that ſanctification which is found in his children to the ſubduing of their luſts, an inordinate affections; and as direct and proper a cauſe of leaving their naturall corruption uncured in others: Nor ſo only but of proſtituting men unto their luſts, and giving them over to their vile affections, to committ abominable things, not affording them ſo much as a naturall reſtraint from ſuch vicious courſes, which he could, and that without any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall grace. And by this poſtitution of them, he knowes how to pay them home for their other ungodly courſes, in ſuch ſort, as they <hi>ſhall receive thereby ſuch recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their errour as is meet;</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath told us <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. But this Authour takes little notice of Gods word thereby to informe himſelfe of Gods providence; but
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56120:239"/>
roves whithin the ſpheare of his owne imagination, and rationall diſcourſe, (yet as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt as well beſeemes him who oppoſeth the free grace of God) as if he would coyne unto us new oracles, the <hi>deviſes</hi> of his owne addle braines. And as for <hi>Tertullians</hi> rule, which this Authour inſiſts upon. <hi>In whoſe power it is that a thing be not done, to him it is imputed, when it is done.</hi> Obſerve whether this Authour doth not make God the Authour of every ſinne that is committed in the world, as well as we. For himſelfe, in the 6. Sect. of the ſecond inconvenience, confeſſeth that <hi>if God had not decreed to ſuffer ſinne, there would be none;</hi> and addes <hi>Who can bring forth that which God will abſolutely hinder.</hi> So then undoubtedly <hi>it is in Gods power, that ſinne be not done.</hi> For he can hinder it; what followeth then? but that to him ſinne is to be imputed, when it is done, by <hi>Tertullians</hi> rule, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by this Authour, quite contrary to the judgment and doctrine of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> putting <note place="margin">

                        <p>The 8. <hi>objection of the Galles</hi> was this <hi>That God will not have all men to be ſaved, but a certaine number of perſons predeſtinate.</hi> Now Proſpers anſwer hereunto is very large, and <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> it begines thus, <hi>If about the ſalvation of all mankind, and calling them unto the knowledge of his truth, the will of God is maintained to be ſo indifferent throughout all ages, that God may be ſhewed to have neglected no man altogether; the unſearchable depth of Gods judgement is hereby aſſaulted. For why did God ſuffer all nations in ages paſt, to walke in their owne wayes when the Lord choſe Iacob to himſelfe, and dealt not ſo with every nation? And why are they now become Gods people, which before were no people of God, &amp;c?</hi> All this makes nothing for this Authour. The next is directly againſt him, not only at large; but in this very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, wherein he alleadeth Proſper not in his anſwer to this 8. objection, but in his ſentence propoſed afterwards upon it. For what is this Authours meaning, (in citeing him to affirme, that <hi>God not only willeth their ſalvation whom he hath predeſtinated, but all men alſo; or at leaſt that ſuch as ſay the contrary, do ſpeake more harſhly then we ought to ſpeaks of the depth of Gods inſcrutable grace)</hi> but to caſt a colour that Proſper concurres with him; and judgeth that <hi>God is indifferunt to ſave all.</hi> But the reaſon why he only ſaves ſome, and not others, is, becauſe ſome prepare themſelves for grace, and accordingly he beſtowes it upon them: Others do not prepare themſelves, and accordingly God doth not beſtow it upon them. Now proſper directly conteſts againſt all ſuch, as maintaine this opinion, and that in two particulars. 1. In taking upon them to give the reaſon of Gods judgements, and that drawen from the wills and actions of men; and which is no leſſe impiety, in thinking that grace is beſtowed by way of reward for good workes; Or reſtrayned from men by reaſon of their evill workes. His words tranſlated run thus, <hi>But whoſoever referreth the cauſes of Gods workes and judgements throughout to the wills and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, and will have Gods diſpenſations varied according to the changeable condition of mans free will; ſuch a one profeſſeth the judgements of God to be ſcrutable, and his wayes ſuch, as may be found out. And that which Paul the Doctor of the Gentiles durſt not touch, this man thinkes he can unlock and make known. And that which is a fruit of no leſſe impiety, the very grace of God whereby we are ſaved, is given by the way of reward for good workes, and denyed, or reſtrained for evill workes.</hi> So that in each particular Proſper is directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry this Authours tenet. Now ſeeing the moſt part of men have not the grace of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, ſuch a grace as is of ſaving nature. And the reaſon by God doth not give

it them, is not in conſideration of their evill workes; let any other ſober and judicious <hi>Aminian</hi> be judge, whether God can be ſayd to will their ſalvation (in ſuch a ſenſe as we ſpeake of it) when he denyeth them the grace of ſalvation, and that not for their evill workes ſake, but (which neceſſarily followeth hereupon) meerely according to the good pleaſure of his will. And indeed in <hi>Proſpers</hi> large anſwer to this eighth objection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Galles, which taketh up almoſt a whole columne in <hi>Auſtin,</hi> this Authour finds nothing at all to faſten upon for his advantage. But yet you will ſay in his eighth ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which he propoſeth, it is as this authour alleadgeth: I grant it; but obſerve his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure well; <hi>The inſcrutable depth of Gods grace may ſuffice to keep us from ſpeaking ſo raſhly, as to ſay that God wills not all to be ſaved, but only a certaine number of perſons predeſtinate.</hi> Where obſerve, firſt, he counts it an harſh ſpeech to ſay, that <hi>God willeth not, that all men ſhall be ſaved;</hi> the reaſon whereof undoutedly is this, becauſe it is expreſly contradictory <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 2.</note> to a text in Scripture. But then if we object, how can God be ſayd to will their ſalvation whom he hath not predeſtinated, to whom he will not give the grace of ſalvation, &amp; that not for their evill workes ſake; but according to the meere pleaſure of his will. Now <hi>Proſpers</hi> anſwer in my judgement is this, <hi>The depth of Gods inſcrutable grace will beare</hi> us out in it; ſo that we need not caſt our ſelves upon ſo harſh an expreſſion, as to deny that God will have all men to be ſaved, which is contradictious to the letter of Gods word. In effect it is, as if he ſhould ſay; It is a ſecret. This I take to be <hi>Proſpers</hi> meaning, and herein I remit my ſelfe to the judicious; But ſure I am that <hi>Proſper</hi> is directly contrary to that opinion whereunto this Authour, by vertue of this ſentence of his, deſires to draw him. In like manner the Authour of the booke, <hi>De vocatione Gentium,</hi> which is commonly thought to be <hi>Prospers,</hi> though <hi>Voſſius</hi> affects to entitle it unto another upon no other ground, but becauſe he conceits that Authour, not to be ſo rigorous in the doctrine of predeſtination, as <hi>Proſper.</hi> But let the judicious compare <hi>Proſpers</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in this particular, with that Authours, and obſerve whether they do not exactly agree For that Authour holds up that text of <hi>Paul, God will have all to be ſaved,</hi> as <hi>Prosper</hi> doth, without aſſaying to cleare it by interpretation as <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth, and will have it goe for a ſecret; and withall he expreſly concurres with <hi>Proſper</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing firſt, that God doth not give grace for mens good workes ſake, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes it for their evill workes. For the ages wherein God ſo plentifully communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his grace were no better then the former. Obſerve farther that <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelfe in his <hi>Enchiridion</hi> treating of this place of <hi>Paul, God will have all to be ſaved,</hi> after he hath given two interpretations thereof, the laſt whereof interpreting it of <hi>genera ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulorum,</hi>

                           <hi>not ſingula generum,</hi> is moſt generally received, as moſt congruous both to Scripture phraſe in generall, and in ſpeciall unto this very text of <hi>Paul,</hi> as <hi>Piſcator</hi> obſerves, and <hi>Voſſius</hi> againſt himſelfe improvidently confeſſeth. Yet ſee the ingenuity of this great light in Gods Church. <hi>If any man can give any other convenient interpretation, let him, provided we be not driven to deny the firſt article of Creed, whereby we confeſſe that God is omnipotent.</hi> And this I conceive proceeded out of a deſire to hold up the meaning of that text to the uttermoſt, that the very letter of it may be applyed ſo we might not be driwen to ſo foule an inconvenience, as to ſay that God willeth that mans ſalvation, which is never ſaved; which is as much as to ſay, that ſuch a one therefore is not ſaved, becauſe God cannot ſave him. Obſerve farther; in the dayes of <hi>Hincmarus</hi> and <hi>Remi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> theſe controverſies being revived in the cauſe of <hi>Goteſchalk,</hi> the church of <hi>Lyons</hi> writes a booke wherein it treats of the meaning of this place of <hi>Paul,</hi> whereof he gives fower expoſitions according to the antient fathers. Firſt, That it is to be underſtood of <hi>genera ſingulorum, not ſingula generum; of all ſorts of men, not of all men of all ſorts.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That none is ſaved but by the will of God. Thirdly, That God workes in us a will or a deſire that all may be ſaved. Fourthly, That God will have all men to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if they will; Then they propoſe their judgement concerning theſe fower expoſitions diſtinguiſhing betweene the three, firſt, and the laſt, thus, <hi>In the three firſt expoſitions of theſe words, wherein it is ſayd, that God willeth all men to be ſaved, no abſurdity is to be found, no repugnancy unto faith.</hi> But as touching the fourth and the laſt; <hi>here we are to take heed, for it gives occaſion to the Pelegian pravity, in as much as it affirmes, that God, that he may ſave men; doth exſpect the wills of men:</hi> (Now this <hi>Pelagian pravity,</hi> is the very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our Authours orthodoxy whom I deale with.) <hi>Againſt this errour,</hi> (ſayth the Church of <hi>Lyons) we read Definitions have beene made in the antient counſels of the fathers.</hi> This I take out of the extracts, which <hi>Voſſius</hi> hath made out of that booke, which goes under the name of the Church of <hi>Lyons,</hi> in his <hi>Pelagian</hi> hiſtory. <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 755, 756.

                        <p>As touching the aſſertion it ſelfe here charged upon our Divines, namely that <hi>God hath determined for the ſinne of Adame to caſt away the greateſt part of mankind.</hi> I have <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> thereunto anſwered at large in my conſideration of M. <hi>Hords</hi> diſcourſe: Yet let me adde ſomething by way of an apt accommodation of that before delivered to cleare the ambiguous phraſe of this Authour, as touching the phraſe of caſting away. For it may well be doubted whether by caſting away (which he makes the Object of Gods determination) he meanes the act of damnation, or the act of denying grace. If the act of damnation, it is moſt untrue. For Reprobates are not damned for originall ſinne on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but for all the actuall ſinnes that have beene committed by them; And as they are, and ſhall be damned for them; So God from everlaſting decreed they ſhould be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for them. Secondly, According to my <hi>Tenet,</hi> in noe moment of nature is Gods decree of damning reprobates, before the preſcience, not of originall ſinne only, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of all their actuall ſinnes. Indeed I do not make the preſcience of ſinne to go before the decree of damnation; Nor do I make the decree of damnation to go before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſinne, but I conceive them to be ſimultaneous. It is true many infants we ſay periſh in originall ſinne only, not living to be guilty of any actuall ſinne of their perſons; why ſhould this ſeeme ſtrange, when M. <hi>Hord</hi> himſelfe profeſſeth in his preface ſect. 4. <hi>That all mankind are involved in the guilt of eternall death?</hi> If all are guilty of eternall death, then it were juſt with God to inflict eternall death upon all for originall ſinne; How much more is it juſt to inflict eternall death upon ſome few, being guilty of it. Therefore obſerve the foxlike cariage of this Authour. For this former free acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the guilt of eternall death adherent to originall ſinne in M <hi>Hords</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, is quite left out in this, though there it was profeſſed with this aſſeveration, <hi>I confidently believe it.</hi> For he well perceived, that this poſition utterly infatuates the ſtrength of his diſcourſe in this place. And I have ſtill looked when theſe men will come to a plaine denyall of Originall ſinne. Now if God may juſtly caſt all mankind away for ſinne originall, and that as touching the inflicting of damnation upon them for it; how much more evident is it to be juſt with God to caſt away all mankind for originall ſinne, as touching the denyall of grace unto them? Now let us proceed to that which is here inſerted out of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Maccovius.</hi> Now <hi>Calvin</hi> ſayth not <hi>that God may with as much juſtice determine men to hell the firſt way, as the latter;</hi> He ſpeakes not at all of Gods decree of damnation, he ſpeaks only of Gods decree <hi>that Adam ſuâ defectione periret, by his fall ſhould be obnoxious to deſtruction</hi> And he proves it by their acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>that it was by the counſell of God, that all à ſalute exciderent unius parentis culpâ, ſhould incurre the loſſe of ſalvation by the fault of one parent.</hi> Hereupon he demands ſaying, <hi>What lets them to grant that of one man, which they muſt grant of all men.</hi> And a little after, <hi>It is too abſurd that thoſe kind patrons of Gods juſtice ſhould thus ſtick at a ſtraw and leap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If he had, I had thought this Authour would have juſtifyed him, as well as M. <hi>Hord,</hi> who in this very place profeſſeth that <hi>Originall ſinne is a ſinne made ours only by Gods appointment.</hi> Indeed as <hi>M. Hord</hi> is now

Likewiſe <hi>the involving of men in the guilt of Adam's ſinne and of eternall death,</hi> is M. <hi>Hord's</hi> phraſe in one place, as before I have ſhewed out of the fourth <hi>Section</hi> of his preface; and that by the only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, did he expreſſe in this place. The ſame argument is uſed by <hi>Maccovius</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to purpoſe (ſo was not that of <hi>Calvin's.</hi> As for that ſaying of <hi>Maccovius,</hi> that God may ordaine men to deſtruction without reſpect to any ſinne of his that is ſo ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is not this manifeſt. 1. In the caſe of annihilation?

For did not Chriſt ſuffer them by the ordinance of his Father? Or was this ſuffering of his for any ſinne of his own? This have I proved more then once in my <hi>Vindiciae</hi> to be in the power of God: And <hi>Medina</hi> profeſſeth as much, and that <hi>ex concordi omnium Theologorum ſententiâ;</hi> And <hi>Vaſquez</hi> the Jeſuite concurres with <hi>Medina</hi> in the ſame opinion. And lately <hi>Raynaudus</hi> in his juſtification of <hi>Valerianus;</hi> who proves this to have been the confeſſion of many of the antient Fathers, and particularly of <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentius</hi> in that booke of his <hi>De praedeſtinatione &amp; gratiâ,</hi> which goes under <hi>Auſtin's</hi> name. And is it not evident by M. <hi>Hord's</hi> acknowledgment, when he ſaith that men are made guilty of <hi>Adam's</hi> ſin, and of eternall death only by God's decree? Which paſſage of M. <hi>Hord's</hi> this Authour hath razed out, and wipeth his lips, as if he had done no iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with his <hi>Index expurgatorius;</hi> not that he hath changed his opinion, as I verily thinke; but becauſe he ſaw what a funeſtous blow it gave unto his cauſe in this particular: Yet is he magnified as a man unanſwerable, none daring to take the bucklers againſt ſuch a <hi>Don Quixot;</hi> But let the judicious conſider this his practiſe well, &amp; whether he be a man of ſuch authority, as deſerving that they ſhould pin their faith on his ſleeve, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that he takes no notice of what I have anſwered to M. <hi>Hord,</hi> to reply thereupon; and that there is ſcarce any thing in all this which I have not anſwered in my <hi>Vindiciae;</hi> Yet he continues to clamour ſtill; at leaſt by other Jack a Lents whom he ſets up, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers nothing, but that which is of his own ſhaping, that making his own bed he may lye the more ſoftly.

Yet upon better conſideration I find it is not ſo much changed, as at firſt ſight I conceived.

                        <p>The ſecond here is moſt altered.

                        <p>The difference he puts between the wayes of God &amp; the myſteries of godlineſſe I have there alſo refuted, ſhewing that albeit ſome wayes of God's juſtice are agreable to the judgment of man, as theſe mentioned, <hi>Eſ:</hi> 5. and <hi>Ezek:</hi> 18, yet all are not, as there I ſhew at large.</p>

Doth not this Authour obſerve the contradictious nature of this propoſition <hi>Gods will is a rule of juſtice to himſelfe.</hi> For a rule of juſtice to any one is a rule to his will, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſated thereby; &amp; can the will be ſaid to be the rule of juſtice to the will without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction? The rule propounded was this, <hi>God's will is the rule of all righteouſneſſe;</hi> but the other rule is the rule corrupted by this Authour, when he talks of a will, as a rule of juſtice to the will. 2. But whether things are therefore juſt, becauſe God wills them; or that therefore God willeth them, becauſe they are juſt; undoubtedly that which here is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed is a truth, namely that whatſoever the Scripture ſets downe to be the will of God, <hi>that muſt needs be juſt.</hi> Neither have we any need to improve it any farther then thus. For it is well known, that our Divines in their doctrine of predeſtination, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation doe depend on nothing ſo much, as the evidence of God's word; As this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor throughout this diſcourſe of his depends on nothing leſſe. And therefore he hath caſt himſelfe upon a ſtrange practice in the former paſſage, namely to evacuate all our reaſons drawn out of the word of God to confirme our doctrine, pleading that the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations we make of Scripture are all falſe, becauſe the contrary doctrine which he maintaines, is juſtified before the tribunall of humane reaſon <hi>purged from prejudice, and falſe principles, corrupt affections and cuſtomes;</hi> Which is as much as to profeſſe in plaine termes, that to find out the truth concerning the decrees of predeſtination and reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt leave the oracles of God, and hearken to the oracles of reaſon, provided that it be purged from prejudice and falſe principles; from corrupt affections and cuſtomes. Now I had thought that the ſpirit of God alone could purge us from ſuch prejudice and falſe principles; corrupt affections and cuſtomes; And that this ſpirit of God worketh on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the word herein, which is called in Scripture <hi>the ſword of the ſpirit;</hi> Yet this Author <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Eph:</hi> 6.</note> tells us not, where this reaſon thus purged is to be found; ſave that in generall he ſaith; that is juſt or unjuſt which is ſo eſteemed in the judgment both of beſt and worſt <hi>that ſtand indifferent to the entertainment of any truth,</hi> as is to be ſeen in the former reaſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to M. <hi>Hord's</hi> diſcourſe. Now who theſe beſt are but the Arminians in this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours fancy; &amp; the worſt, but Anabaptiſts or heathens; or both I know not; Sure we are none of them <hi>in his underſtanding purged from falſe principles and prejudice, from corrupt affections and cuſtomes;</hi> becauſe we doe not <hi>ſtand indifferent to the entertainment of his tenets,</hi> which he calls <hi>Truths.</hi> 3. Where can he ſhew that I have made uſe of any ſuch princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to anſwer any argument of his againſt us. I doe not find that any where he can drive me to this though this be the Apoſtles courſe, as we may ſee <hi>Ro:</hi> 9. <hi>Is there any injuſtice with God? God forbid,</hi> how doth he prove it, but thus, becauſe the Scripture attributes ſuch a courſe to God; <hi>I will ſhew mercy on whom I will ſhew mercy, and I will have compaſſion, on whome I will have compaſſion.</hi> 4. But where hath he learnt to be ſo audacious as to ſay that, <hi>Things are not therefore juſt becauſe God wills them, but that his juſtice is rather a rule of his will and works?</hi> Before he told us, that juſtice in man, and God were of the ſame nature; Now that juſtice which is the rule of our will is, <hi>Juſtitia obligans,</hi> juſtice binding us to doe this or that; and is Gods juſtice obligatory likewiſe to bind him? In making the world, I doe not doubt, but God did that which was juſt; but was there any juſtice in God obliging him to the making of the world? who ſeeth not, what an Atheiſticall concluſion followeth herehence, namely that the world was from everlaſting, if not neceſſarily by neceſſity of nature; yet neceſſarily by obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of juſtice? otherwiſe for an infinite ſpace of time wherein the world was not made (which muſt needs have been if the world were not, from everlaſting) God had been and continued to be unjuſt. The Schooles have taught me that there is a juſtice of condecency conſequent to all the actions of God, noe juſtice of obligation precedent to it. And whereas St. Paul tells us that <hi>God works all things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the counſell of his will,</hi> both <hi>Alvarez</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> though School, Divines of oppoſite families, yet concurre in this that this <hi>Counſell is, à libera voluntate acceptum, accepted of Gods free will.</hi> And it is obſervable, that the Apoſtle calls it not the <hi>Counſell of his underſtanding, but the counſell of his will</hi> And <hi>Vaſqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But let us examine how well he proves his own Tenet; And that is firſt by the authority of <hi>Hierome</hi> in his preface to his commentaries on <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 2. By the authority of <hi>Zanchy;</hi> whereto I anſwer. 1. That if the interpretations of Scripture muſt be judged of before the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of reaſon <hi>purged from prejudice and falſe principles, from corrupt affections and cuſtomes;</hi> muſt not the opinions of ſuch as <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Zanchy</hi> be judged of before the ſame tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall alſo? 2ly, touching <hi>Hierome</hi> himſelfe. 1. It is true <hi>Hierome</hi> in that preface under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands that command given <hi>Hoſea</hi> to be only in a Type, and for the reaſon here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but in his Commentary he interpreteth it <hi>ſecundum hiſtoriam, litterally.</hi> Neither was the Prophet as he ſaith, to be blamed in this. For he was not the worſe, but he made her the better. <hi>Praeſertim eſpecially</hi> he was not to be blamed, <hi>becauſe he did this not luxuriouſly or luſtfully, or of his own will, but in obedience to the command of God.</hi> Now let the indifferent judge whether <hi>Hierome</hi> be not as much for us upon the text, as for our adverſary in the preface. 2. Obſerve that <hi>Hierome</hi> is nothing for him in the preface. For <hi>Hierome</hi> ſpeakes there of God's will of command, but we treate of God's will as it ſignifies not his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand given to man, but his own purpoſe and decree to doe this or that himſelfe. Judge of the extravagancy of this Author by this, and whether his underſtanding be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purged from prejudice and falſe principles, from corrupt affections and cuſtomes; as to make the laſt reſolution of our faith concerning the waies of God thereunto, or the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of ſuch as he is, whether beſt or worſt, or of both ſizes upon a mere pretence of their indifferency for the entertainement of truths.</p>
                        <p>We willingly grant with <hi>Zanchy</hi> that God can will nothing which is not juſt; Not that hereby we make any juſtice to precede the will of God; but becauſe he hath a lawfull power to doe what he will; And there is a juſtice of condency conſequent to all his actions. It is otherwiſe, I confeſſe, with a man though the greateſt of men, as wiſe as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> though veſſells after God's own heart, as <hi>David:</hi> But hence it followeth not, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in an earthly King there is a juſtice antecedent to his will, therefore it is ſo in the King of heaven and earth. If this Authour thinke otherwiſe, let him know I am not yet ſufficiently convicted of the purity of his underſtanding purged from prejudice and falſe principles &amp;c. as thereinto to make the laſt reſolution of my faith.</p>
                        <p>Yet I confeſſe he carrieth himſelfe magnificently as if he had attained to this purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as when he ſaith, <hi>That theſe abſolute decrees of ſalvation and damnation, are not part of God's revealed will;</hi> But where hath he proved the conditionall decrees that he ſtands for, are any part of God's revealed will. Where doth he find that God decreed to beſtow faith and repentance upon a man, becauſe of ſome good works of his, or deny it to others for failing of ſome good worke? As for ſalvation and damnation we plainly profeſſe, that God intended not to damne any man, but for ſinne, nor to beſtow ſalvation on any man of ripe yeares, but by way of reward of his faith, repentance, obedience and good works. Doth not he begge the queſtion all along, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he carrieth his conditionall decrees in a confidentiary manner, without once offering to prove thè by any one place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? Here Iexpected he would not begge the queſtion, when he chargeth us to begge the queſtion moſt inſipidly; When it is well known that our Divines are frequent in proving their doctrine out of Scripture; which if it faile of ſound proofe in the judgment of his underſtanding purged from prejudice and falſe principles; yet with no modeſty; whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their judgment be) can he taxe them for begging the queſtion. For to begge the queſtion is not once to offer to prove what they ſay; which is this Authour's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe all along. But to ſupply the place of arguments, he uſually foiſt's in a phraſe at pleaſure in expreſſing our Tenet of God's decrees; as of <hi>Decreeing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably and unavoidably;</hi> Or as here he ſpeakes of <hi>Damnation and ſalvation inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> whereas we doe not uſe to clogge our own expreſſions, or our Readers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions with any ſuch bugheares. We rather ſay that God decrees all things to come to paſſe, that do come to paſſe, and that agreably to their natures, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary things neceſſarily; and contingent things to come to paſſe contingently. And ſurely for doctrines of faith, I thinke every ſober Chriſtian hath cauſe to entitle the King to be the Authour of them, this Authour doth not ſo much for his: Nay the Scripture to him ſeemed ſo evidently to make for us (which I deſire every wiſe Reader well to obſerve) that this drave him to ſuch a ſluttiſh ſhift, as to except againſt our interpretations of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56120:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon noe other ground but this, that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> confirmed thereby is not conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>to the underſtanding of men purged from prejudice and falſe principles, corrupt affections and cuſtomes,</hi> in the deſigning of what is juſt, and what is unjuſt; And let every indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent man judge whether this be not a deſperate courſe, carying with it a ſecret acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment that the Scripture indeed doth favour the way we take in the Doctrine of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination and reprobation. And indeed the ninth to the <hi>Romans Gerardus Voſſius</hi> calls <hi>Gorgons</hi> head whereby we thinke (ſo evident is the Apoſtles meaning on our ſide) to turne all our oppoſites into ſtones, though ſuch vants are none of ours; but himſelfe it ſeemes had been ſtupified by it, had he not timely taken hold of <hi>Scientia media,</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites invention, and as vile an invention as ever reaſonable men conceived.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Laſtly he tells us like a reſolute Sir, that <hi>abſolute reprobation can be no part of God's revealed will;</hi> and his reaſon is; <hi>becauſe it is odious to right reaſon.</hi> He doth not ſhew how it is contrariant to God's word; but bravely preſumes that his reaſon is right, as if he were of the number of that ſynedrion whoſe underſtandings are purged <hi>from prejudice and falſe principles, from corrupt affections and cuſtomes;</hi> and ere he is aware bewraies what he meanes by reaſon, when he attributes hatred unto it; And I verily believe his beſt reaſon is the ſtrength of his affection. By the way let the Reader obſerve, that he is as oppoſite to abſolute election, as to abſolute reprobation; only he diſchargeth his right reaſon and the ſpleen thereof againſt abſolute reprobation, not againſt abſolute election. We may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily gueſſe the true notion of his right reaſon in this; his whole diſcourſe ſavouring farre more throughout of the foxes, then of the Lyons skin. Now I have given him ſix reaſons for the abſoluteneſſe of reprobation, becauſe he appeales to reaſon purged from preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and falſe principles, and not one of them hath he anſwered, though they went out of my hands now full three yeares agoe. I will adventure to give him ſome reaſons for it alſo out of God's word. For I deſire to follow the crooked ſerpent which way ſoever he winds and turnes. Therefore thus I diſpute, Predeſtination is abſolute, therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation is abſolute. For if reprobation be not abſolute, but proceeds according to mens evill works, then predeſtination is not abſolute, but proceeds according to mens good works, whether faith or other obedience; according to that of <hi>Auſtin.

For the ſame reaſon he predeſtinated Iacob that he ſhould rule over the Elder becauſe he foreſaw his good works; and ſo falſe is that which the Apoſtle ſaith, not of works.</hi> Now that predeſtination is abſolute I prove thus.

If predeſtination were upon the foreſight of faith, then it ſhould be only upon the foreſight of ſuch a faith as perſeveres to the end; whence two inconveniences follow 1. That no man can be aſſured of his election untill his death, which is quite contrary unto Scripture. For <hi>Paul</hi> was aſſured of the election of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> by obſervation of the <hi>works of their faith, the labour of their love, and the patience of their hope,</hi> 2. In this <note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ:</hi> 3, 4.</note> caſe none can be ſtrengthened againſt the power of temptation by the aſſurance of their election; But thus we are ſtrengthned by Chiſt. <hi>Mat:</hi> 24. 24. by St. <hi>Paul. Rom:</hi> 8. 29. 2 <hi>Theſ:</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Election is abſolute, therefore reprobation is abſolute. The antecedent I prove; If it be neither of faith nor of works, then it is abſolute, but it is neither of faith, nor works. <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 11.</note> Not of works, expreſly; Not of faith as appeates by the ſame reaſon whereby <hi>Paul</hi> proves it is not of works. For the reaſon is this, <hi>Before the children were borne or had done good or evill, it was ſaid the Elder ſhall ſerve the younger; Therefore election is not of works.</hi> Now ſay I we may as well conclude therehence, therefore it is not of faith; foraſmuch as before they were borne, they were as uncapable of faith as of works. The conſequence I prove thus; Looke by what reaſon St. <hi>Paul</hi> proves, that the election of <hi>Iacob</hi> was not of good works, becauſe before they were borne 'twas ſaid, <hi>The Elder ſhall ſerve the younger;</hi> by the ſame reaſon it is evident that the reprobation of <hi>Eſau</hi> was not of evill works; the ſubjection of <hi>Eſau</hi> unto his younger brother, as lively repreſenting his reprobation, as the dominion of <hi>Iacob</hi> over his elder brother repreſents his election.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Predeſtination is defined by <hi>Auſtin</hi> to be <hi>Praeparatio gratiae, the preparation of grace,</hi> therefore reprobation which is oppoſite thereunto muſt be the <hi>not preparation of grace;</hi> that is God's decree not to give grace, like as the oppoſite is Gods decree to give grace. Now God gives grace not according to works. <hi>For he hath mercy on whom he will</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <note place="margin">

                           <hi>Auſtin</hi> builds his doctrine of predeſtination. Now by his doctrine predeſtination is abſolute as <hi>Gerardus Voſſius</hi> confeſſeth in his preface to his hiſtory of the hereſy of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius;</hi> How can it be otherwiſe? For if God conferres grace not according to mens works; but according to his own purpoſe and grace. How much more did he decree to give it <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Rom:</hi> 9. 18.</note> not upon any foreſight of works, but of his mere pleaſure. And the Scripture as clearely teſtifies, that as <hi>God hath mercy on whom he will;</hi> ſo <hi>whom he will he hardneth;</hi> that is of mere pleaſure he denieth grace to ſome, as of mere pleaſure he grants it unto others; And therefore reprobation grounded hereupon muſt needs be as abſolute, as predeſtination grounded upon the other.</p>

Thus as formerly I gave ſix reaſons to juſtifie the abſoluteneſſe of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, becauſe he pretended the abſoluteneſſe thereof was repugnant to reaſon; ſo here I have given ſix more derived out of the word of God, to prove that this doctrine is the revealed will of God, to ſtop his empty mouth that clamoureth and only clamoureth that <hi>it is no part of God's revealed will.</hi> And that this doctrine is not only conformable to right reaſon, but by convincing arguments in right reaſon demonſtrable I have already ſhewed; And that all the abſurdities this Authour blatters of, they prove to be no better then the mere imagination of a vaine thing. That which here he diſcourſeth of <hi>a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervice,</hi> comes out of it's place, it belonged to the former reaſon in M. <hi>Hord's</hi> treatiſe, and there I have anſwered it, and ſhewed the abſurd interpretation that he makes of it.</p>
                        <p>He vaunts that he hath proved reprobation abſolute to be unjuſt, when he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed no thing leſſe; But making only a greate cracke, he goes out like a ſquib; and throughout meddles not with one argument that our Divines bring out of Scripture, or reaſon to juſtifie their doctrine concerning the abſoluteneſſe of reprobation. And it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56120:244"/>
that he denies the abſoluteneſſe of election, as well as the abſoluteneſſe of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and conſequently muſt neceſſarily maintaine that grace is given according to works; whereupon it was that <hi>Auſtin</hi> grounded his doctrine concerning the abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Predeſtination: And upon the like ground have we as good cauſe to ground our doctrine concerning the abſoluteneſſe of reprobation, it being every way as evident, that Grace is not denied according unto works, as that it is not granted according to mens works; And the Scripture is equally as expreſſe concerning both, where it is ſaid that as <hi>God hath mercy on whom he will,</hi> ſo alſo <hi>whom he will he hardneth.</hi>

For when he put his mouth to the water to drinke, it waved away from him; And when he reached his hand to the fruit to have eaten of it, it withdrew it ſelfe preſently out of his reach; ſo as he could neither eate nor drinke. Juſt ſo dealeth God with reprobates; (by their doctrine) He placeth them under the plentifull meanes of ſalvation, offereth it to them ſo plainly, that men would thinke they might have it when they will, &amp; yet intendeth fully they ſhall never have it, withholding from them either the firſt grace that they cannot believe, or the ſecond grace that they cannot perſevere. Did not thoſe gods delude <hi>Tantalus?</hi> yes doubtleſſe. And if God doe ſo with reprobates, what did he but delude them, and diſſenible with them in his faireſt and likelieſt offers of ſalvation that he makes them?

But theſe words according to their quotations <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> here, are not to be found; the ſeverall diſtinct paſſages are diſtinguiſhed by numbers, which in all editions hold the ſame, not ſo the pages. Yet the latter paſſage quoted p. 143. I meet with in mine p. 128. According to the like difference I try whether I can find out the other, but in vaine. But yet I meet with ſuch matter of diſcourſe as whereunto this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is very congruous to be there delivered if any where; yet no ſuch thing is there deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered as <hi>num:</hi> 74. <hi>Schaffman's</hi> argument is this, <hi>If God calls all to ſalvation then he will ſave all.</hi> To this <hi>Piſcator</hi> anſwereth, <hi>The propoſition is falſe; But he calls with, animo ſimplici at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que vero, a ſimple mind and true. Sane</hi> ſaith <hi>Piſcator,</hi> as much as to ſay, I grant that; <hi>but ſo as that he calls them with condition of repentance and faith; Therefore as he promiſeth ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeriouſly unto them that performe this condition, and therefore performes this promiſe. So on the contrary he doth ſeriouſly threaten death and damnation to them who doe not fulfill the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and performes unto him that commination. Then, though God be not capable of hypocriſy yet he doth not alwaies will that what he commands ſhall be alwaies performed by him to whom he gives that command; Whether by commanding he meanes to prove a man; as to prove Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, he commanded him to ſacrifice his Son; or becauſe to him whom he commandeth, he will not give grace to performe that command, as he deales with reprobates.</hi> And <hi>num:</hi> 120. To <hi>Schaffman's</hi> objection which was this; <hi>God is no hypocrite,</hi> he anſwers thus; <hi>But yet he gives not grace to all to performe what he commands the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For promiſcuouſly he commands as well reprobates as elect to believe; as many as he calls by the preaching of the goſpell; but he gives this grace to his elect alone according to that, To you it is given to know the myſteries of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, but to them it is not given.</hi> So that undoubtedly God offers grace (to wit pardon of ſinne) with a purpoſe to communicate it to all that ſhall believe, according to <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 11.</note> the judgment of <hi>Piſcator,</hi> neither doth he offer it with a purpoſe to communicate it to any unleſſe they believe. But the grace of faith is not offered to any with a purpoſe to communicate it upon a condition. For then grace ſhould be conferred according unto works, which is manifeſt <hi>Pelagianiſme.</hi> As for the other which I meete with <hi>p:</hi> 128. <hi>num:</hi> 120: take it at full, and not as it is diſmembred by this Authour, who cares not how he calumniates, ſo he might advantage his own cauſe. <hi>Schaffman's</hi> objection was, <hi>Deus eſt unius &amp; linguae &amp; voluntatis, God is both of the ſame tongue and will.</hi> Whereto <hi>Piſcator</hi> anſwers thus, <hi>Your meaning is that God, look what he profeſſeth with his tongue, that he willeth;</hi>
                           <pb n="157" facs="tcp:56120:244"/>
                           <hi>But this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not alwaies true, nor in all particulars. For by his tongue that is by ſpeech uttered, he profeſſed that he would have Abraham to ſacrifice his Son Iſaac; yet he would not have him ſacrificed. With his tongue he profeſſed by his ſervant Ionas that he would deſtroy Nineveh within forty dayes, yet he would not ſo doe. With his tongue by the miniſters of the Goſpell he profeſſeth that he would have the reprobates to whom he ſpeaketh among his Elect, to believe the Goſpell, in as much as he commands them ſo to doe; yet he would not have them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, in as much as he will not give them the grace of believing, without will no man can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. What therefore is God an Hypocrite? Away with ſuch a blaſphemy. He alone is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an Hypocrite, who counterfeits holineſſe when he has none; Such counterfeiting is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to God.</hi> And let the Reader obſerve well the immodeſt cariage of this Authour. <hi>Piſcator</hi> when he ſaith that <hi>God in words profeſſeth he will have Reprobates to believe,</hi> he ſhewes withall in what reſpect he doth ſo, to wit, <hi>quatenus mandat ut credant, in as much as he commands them to believe.</hi> And indeed God's command is uſually called God's will, and by none more then by theſe our oppoſites. But this Authour drawes this to the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of God's will ſimply ſo called, which is the will of purpoſe; And to that purpoſe leaves out the words whereby <hi>Piſcator</hi> explicates himſelfe. Who knowes not that God commanded <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by his ſervant <hi>Moſes</hi> to let Iſrael goe? this is to profeſſe with the tongue in <hi>Piſcator's</hi> phraſe, that God would have <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let Iſrael goe. And God's commandement is called God's will in Scripture. <hi>This is the will of God even your ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ;</hi> 4. 3.</note> But to ſpeake properly it is but the ſignification of God's will of good pleaſure (properly called the will of God) that it ſhould be <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> duty to let Iſrael goe, but withall he revealed to <hi>Moſes</hi> that <hi>he would harden Pharaoh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s heart, that he ſhould not let Iſrael goe.</hi> Now let the indifferent judge what this Authour hath gotten by theſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of <hi>Piſcator,</hi> ſave only the diſplaying of his own immodeſt and calumniating courſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then he thinks to pleaſe his Reader with the ſtory of <hi>Tantalus;</hi> wherein there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity to that whereunto it is applyed, For <hi>Tantalus à labris ſitiens fugientia captat Flumina,—He was an hungred, and would faine eate but could not: He was a thirſt, and would faine drinke but could not.</hi> God deales ſo with no man; neither reprobate Jewes, nor Gentiles had any deſire to be partakers of the mercies of God offered them in Chriſt. The Goſpell was a ſcandall to the one, and fooliſhneſſe to the other; <hi>But to them that are called it is the power of God and wiſedome of God</hi> And as they hunger and thirſt after God's righteouſneſſe in his deare Son; ſo are they ſatiſfied therewith, <hi>Let him that is a thirſt come and drinke of the water of life freely.</hi> And <hi>He every one that is a thirſt, come ye to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>

                        <p>2ly, Conſider further the ſtrange infatuation of this Author, more waies then one. For 1, inquire of him, whether after all this worke of the miniſtery performed by him unto reprobates, he thinks not himſelfe bound to pray unto God for a bleſſing upon his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, whereby it may become effectuall unto them, and that upon this ground, becauſe <hi>Paul may plant, and Apollo may water, but God is he who gives the encreaſe.</hi> And let him expreſſe what the encreaſe is, which he beggeth at the hand of God, whether it be not the performance of thoſe duties whereunto he hath exhorted them in the moſt emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call manner, that the word of God doth afford any example of. And if no more be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for the working of man's will to that which is good (having as this Authour ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a power to performe obedience if they will) then theſe enforcements which he ſo much amplifies; whereto tend his prayers after all theſe enforcements are uſed? is it that God will afford his concourſe to the act? Why is this a worke of grace? Doth not God afford this to the moſt ſinfull act that is, without all prayers? And is it decent to maintaine that God of himſelfe is forward enough to afford concourſe to ſuch acts as are evill, be they never ſo abominable; but to concurre with us to that which is good, he ſtands off and muſt be entreated and ſollicited by our prayers earneſt and fervent,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56120:245"/>
otherwiſe he will be ſlacke to concurre to that which is good, though nothing ſlack to concurre to that which is evill? Nay is it poſſible that man ſhould will ought, or doe ought, and God not concurre with him, to the producing both of the will and the deed? Now I had thought prayers tended to the procuring of works of grace, ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is not, as which is performed of God 1. To ſinfull acts, as well as to pious acts. 2. And that neceſſarily upon ſuppoſition that the reaſonable creature doth ought. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider farther, if his prayers tend only to the procuring of God's concurrence, and this concurrence is upon ſuppoſition of mans concurrence; let the indifferent, I ſay, conſider the genius of this man's prayers. For albeit the forme of them runnes thus, that God will convert his hearers to faith, to repentance, and to work in them that which is pleaſing in his ſight through Jeſus Chriſt; yea to worke in them both the will, and the deed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his good pleaſure, to circumciſe their hearts, to love the Lord their God with all their hearts, &amp; with all their ſouls, to heal their backſlidings; yea as he ſeeth all their waies, ſo to heale them, to cauſe them to walke in his ſtatutes, and to keep his judgments, and to doe them; yea to put his feare in their hearts, that they may never depart away from him. (For thus he muſt pray, if he pray in faith built upon God's promiſes, we having ſpeciall promiſes for all theſe particulars;) yet his meaning is no more then this, that as many of his Auditors as he findes willing to doe ought of this, that God will concurre with them to make them willing; And as many as doe performe it, he will concurre to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it; as for thoſe that are unwilling, he will not pray that God will make them willing, though that hath been ever the Lords courſe towards ſome, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, And as for that prayer of <hi>Auſtin, Da Domine quod jubes &amp; jube quid vis, Lord give me to doe what thou commandeſt, and then command what thou will.</hi> Like enough he ſpights it as much as ever <hi>Pelagius</hi> did. But if any are forward to hate &amp; to deſpite God's word, or the profeſſours of his truth, he will not pray unto God to concurre with them thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For he knowes God's forwardneſſe to concurre to the performance of every abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable act without his prayers: Nay in deſpite of any prayers to the contrary: And doth he not thinke it in vaine for the holieſt man that ever was to pray for this? 3. Againe obſerve he ſaith that by our doctrine the whole miniſtery is <hi>a mere impoſture,</hi> &amp; why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is in ſhew hearty and ſerious, but in truth nothing ſo. But what moves him to ſay this, doth not God procure hereby the converſion &amp; ſalvation of millions? vea of many of thoſe who have crucified the Son of God; who have perſecuted his Church? Do we not believe that a time ſhall come wherin the Jews ſhall be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verted in ſpight of all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer obſtinacy, &amp; in deſpight of all their blaſphemies powred ſorth againſt the Son of God? But he will ſay, that grace is ſhewed only to the Elect by our opinion. But here let every indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perſon judg between us of the equity of this his diſcourſe. <hi>The whole miniſtery is a mere impoſture; becauſe all the inforcements wherewith the tender of ſalvation unto Reprobates is accompanied is in ſhew moſt hearty &amp; ſerious, but indued nothing ſo.</hi> For what? have the elect of God no part in the miniſtery? Or dates he ſay that by our doctrin theſe inſorcements are nothing hearty &amp; ſerious to them? Thou wilt ſay the Authour's meaning is, that the whole miniſtery is a mere impoſture towards reprobates; but he ſaith not ſo; but thus, <hi>The whole miniſtery is a mere impoſture;</hi> and afterwards in giving his reaſon for it, he pleads, that inforcements in ſhew hearty &amp; ſerious made to reprobates are nothing ſo; &amp; hence he concludes that the whole miniſtery is a mere impoſture without any diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to whom it is a mere impoſture 4. Yet I willingly confeſſe that it is foul enough, that God's courſes ſhould be courſes of impoſture towards any even towards reprobates. But how doth he prove, that God takes any ſuch courſe with reprobates? To whom hath God ſent his word &amp; vouchſafed the miniſtery hereof according to all the enforcements me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned accompanying his tender of ſalvation unto them? is it not unto his Church? <hi>What is the preſerment of the Jew above the Gentile? much every way,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, chiefly becauſe unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were committed the Oracles of God.</hi> And was the Church of Jewes, a Church of reprobates, Were they not the City of God, but the city of the Devill?

All that he hath to ſay for this is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that a great part, or the moſt part of the people to whom he ſends his prophets are reprobates. Be it ſo, but how doth he prove that God intends this miniſtery; for the ſalvation of reprobates; or that he intends it at all for them? If God commands them, as he commanded <hi>Ieremiah</hi> ſaying, <hi>Goe &amp; cry in the eares of Jeruſalem, Thus ſaith the Lord;</hi> they muſt doe ſo without difference. For they are not able to put a difference between the Elect and Reprobate, to know who are the one, and who are the other. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was willing to pray for all, but yet he profeſſeth,

And to ordaine to damnation I ſhould think is to hate rather then to love; and this ordination divine was from everlaſting.

Satan, may for ought I know belong to God's election, and in good time come out of the ſnare of Satan; And becauſe the miniſtry of the word is the only meanes whereby God brings men unto repentance, and that by inſtruction, admonition and exhortation; therefore I doe inſtruct them in the knowledge of God that made them after his own Image; and how this image of God came to be defaced in them, to wit, by the ſinne of our firſt parents, and how hereupon we became to be ſhapen in ſinne, and borne in ſinne, and therewithall children of wrath, and ſuch as deſerve to be made the generation of God's curſe; then I repreſent unto them the mercy of God towards man in giving us his Son to beare our ſins in his body upon the tree, and ſuffer a ſhamefull and bitter death upon the croſſe for them; and that for this his Son's ſake he offers unto us the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of all our ſins upon our repentance, and faith in Chriſt, and thereupon I exhort them unto repentance: We farther ſay that God takes no pleaſure in the death of him that dieth, but takes pleaſure in a man's repentance.

It was an Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall &amp; ſcoffing denyall of his demand. If the King ſhould make an unrepealable law that no German ſhould be made a Citizen of London or free Denizon of the kingdome, &amp; then make a decree to give ſome bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gratuities, but to the Citizens of London, or to the ſubjects of the kingdome only, &amp; to none but them; And yet for all this ſhould command it to be proclaimed, that he will give them to the Germans upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condition they will be made free men of London, or be incorporated into the Kingdome; would not any man ſay that the King in this caſe did diſſemble and delude the poore Dutchmen?

In like manner if God have made a decree, that ſuch men ſhall never believe, and yet offer them heaven upon condition, they will believe, it may moſt truly be ſayd that God doth not only deny them heaven but deny it with a bitter deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is farre from that candor and goodneſſe that dwelleth in him.</p>

                           <hi>Hord</hi> I have ſhewed that the reaſon why <hi>Salvation is propoſed in ſcripture to be obtaind up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a condition to be performed by man,</hi> is becauſe God intends to ſave thoſe, whom he doth ſave after a manner a greable to their reaſonable natures; Namely by inſtruction, in a law of works, in a law of faith, by admonition and exhortation ſtrengthned with promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the obedient, with threatnings to the diſobedient. And albeit men are not able to performe this obedience of themſelves, being diſabled by that naturall corruption, which they have drawn from the Loynes of our father, in whom our natures received a mortall blow, through his diſobedience, and became diſabled to performe any thing acceptable in the ſight of God <hi>(for they that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God)</hi> therefore the Lord is ready according to the covenant of grace to circumciſe the hearts of ſome, namely of his Elect, <hi>To love the Lord with all their hearts, and with all their ſoules, to put his ſpirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, to cauſe them to walke in his ſtatutes, to keepe his judgments and doe them.</hi> It is true this offer of ſalvation is propoſed to all within the Church, whether Elect or Reprobate; and no marvaile. For the Miniſters of God's word are not acquainted with the counſells of God, as touching the election or reprobation of any man in particular: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they preach unto all, but knowing full well that this their miniſtery ſhall be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall only to God's elect, as touching their ſalvation.

Dares he ſay, that faith and repentance are poſſible by power of nature? Or doth any of us deny it to be poſſible by grace? If this be ſo it followeth that all the queſtion between us ſhould be drawen to this iſſue; whether God gives the grace of faith and repentance unto all; Yet indeed the truth herein deſerves to be put out of all queſtion, it being apparent that, <hi>Fides non eſt omnium, all men doe not believe.</hi> Nay it is called in Scripture <hi>the Faith of God's elect:</hi> So that the, queſtion is about the nature of that grace, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ:</hi> 3 <hi>Tit:</hi> 1. 1.</note> without which faith and repentance cannot be performed.

His ſubdolous carriage through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in concealing his Tenet is ſufficient to diſparage his cauſe with all that are indifferent and judicious.

And to whom he ſaith this, to them he ſaith alſo, <hi>Oh that there were ſuch an heart in them to feare me &amp;c.</hi> If he ſaith, he gives faith abſolutely to none, but conditionally, and upon the ſame condition he is ready to give to all; this is clearely to confeſſe that the grace of God is given according to man's workes. Againe <hi>'tis God that worketh in us both the will and the deed, and that according to his good pleaſure,</hi>

Then what condition can be deviſed whereupon God workes in us the will? If he ſay the grace which God gives to all, and whereby to believe, to repent is made a thing poſſible unto all (For thus we muſt proceed groaping after his meaning, he affecting nothing more then to ſculke and earth himſelfe in his concealements) I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer firſt; The Scripture makes no mention of any ſuch power given to any; but to the contrary profeſſeth of all perſons unregenerate, that <hi>they cannot pleaſe God;</hi> that <hi>They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcerne the things of God.</hi> 1 Co: 2. 14: that <hi>They cannot believe,</hi> that <hi>They cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi>

The Scripture plainly ſaith that faith is the gift of God, repentance is the gift of God; It doth not ſay that the power to believe if they will is the gift of God. If he ſaith by faith is meant ſuch a power, whereby a man may believe if he will, I prove the contrary; then <hi>all men ſhould have faith.</hi> For in this mans opinion, all men are indued with this power: But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle plainly ſaith that, <hi>All men have not faith.</hi> Againe faith is deſcribed to be, <hi>The faith of God's Elect;</hi> but a power to believe if we will, this Authour makes common to the Elect <note place="margin">

Moreover if to give power to believe if a man will, be to give him faith, then in as much as God gives power to ſinne if he will, he may be ſaid as well, that God gives ſinne. Adde to this that <hi>to have power to believe, if one will;</hi> is rather nature then <note place="margin">

For it is no more then <hi>poſſe fidem habere;</hi> and this is the nature of man as <hi>Auſtin</hi> teſtifies. <hi>Poſſe fidem habere naturae eſt hominum, fidem habere gratiae eſt fidelium; 'Tis the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man that he may have faith, but it is of the grace of the faithfull, that a man hath faith.</hi>
                           <pb n="165" facs="tcp:56120:248"/>
And indeed if faith given us of God, did only inable us to believe, if we will; it were farre inferiour to a morall vertue, which doth not give man power to be vertuous, if he will; or to performe a vertuous act if he will: but makes him vertuous, and diſpoſeth the will to vertuous acts only, and leaves him not indifferent, whether he will performe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous acts, or no. To returne then, if no other grace be required to free God from mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deriding his creature; ſurely we are as free as our adverſaries from making God to deride and mocke his creature. For we are ready to grant that all men may believe if they will, repent if they will with <hi>Auſtin l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Gen: cont: Man: cap:</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; De ſpiritu &amp; liter â ad Marcellin. cap:</hi> 32. <hi>&amp; De praedeſt. in: Sanct: cap:</hi> 5. And our reaſon is this. Not to be able to doe that which a man will doe, is impotency merely naturall; but the impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that we ſpeake of, which is hereditary to all mankind by reaſon of the fall, is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency morall, and reſident in the will of man. For who doubts but that the will to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, is to believe? For <hi>credimus ſi volumus:</hi> So the will to repent is to repent.

And <hi>Pelagius</hi> of three things propoſed. <hi>Poſſe, Velle, &amp; Agere;</hi> he willingly granted the firſt, to wit, <hi>Poſſe bonum,</hi> to be from God; but he denied the other two to be the works of God; but of our free wills; which if he had acknowledged to be the workes of God, as well as the firſt <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells him that, ab <hi>Apoſtolicâ doctrinâ abhorrere non videretur; he ſhould not ſeeme to vary from the doctrine of the Apoſtles.</hi> And for ought I ſee this Authour goes not one <note place="margin">

He ſaith alſo that God doth concurre to the act; but ſo he doth in his opinion to every ſinfull act; ſo that this is but a generall concourſe: and what Pelagian was ever known to deny, but that God might have as great an hand in any good act, as in any naturall act? Now ſince we acknowledge all this as well as he; what colour hath he to impute unto us, that we by our doctrine ſo faſhion God's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as to make him deride and mock miſerable people. Though the Jebuſites did mock <hi>David,</hi> as this Authour gives his word for it, (though I doe not find that <hi>Ribbi David Kimhi,</hi> or <hi>Piſcator</hi> count it any deriſion, but a plaine repreſentation of their confidence, that <hi>David</hi> was never able to take it, ſuch was the ſtrength of the tower<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>, that the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, even the blind and the lame were ſufficient to defend it.) Though withall <hi>Kimhi</hi> acquaints us with a ſtrange ſtory out of the Jews <hi>Daraſhe,</hi> of a Covenant made between <hi>Abraham</hi> and King <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and that concerning not him alone, but his Son and his Nephew, to ſuffer them quietly to enjoy their own; And that the Nephew of that <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi> was alive at that time when <hi>David</hi> came to beſiege that fort: And that therein the Jebuſites had erected two Images, the one blind to repreſent <hi>I ſaack</hi> who in his old age was blind; and the other lame repreſenting <hi>Jacob,</hi> who by wreſtling with God became lame, and in the mouthes of theſe Images was kept the Covenant which was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Abimelech.</hi> The inſtance he gives of a proclamation which takes up the greateſt part of this ſupplement (as a great part of this Authour's diſcourſe, is ſpent in ſuch inſicete repreſentations) is moſt incongruous, not only to the matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it is applyed, but to the parts of it ſelfe. 1. To the matter whereunto it is applyed. For it is propoſed in ſuch a caſe, as men could not obtaine a certaine incorporation, though they much deſired it. Now ſuch a thing is not incident to Reprobates, namely that they cannot believe though they would For had they a will to believe, undoubtedly that would be accepted of God. Then. 2 it is incongruous to the parts of the Simile it ſelfe. For incorporation only is precluded unto Germans by the unrepealable law, he feignes without common underſtanding. For undoubtedly all lawes of men are repealable by the ſame authority, whereby they are made. And afterwards the condition of obtaining certaine bountifull gratuities, by vertue of the foreſaid incorporation, is propoſed moſt undecently, not of their being incorporated into that ſociety, but of their will to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated. Now it is apparent that by the caſe feigned their incorporation only is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded unto them, not their will to be incorporated. In the accommodation he ſaith, <hi>God hath made a decree</hi> (by our doctrin) <hi>that ſuch men ſhall never believe.</hi> Now what one of our Divines can be produce to juſtifie this? We ſay God hath decreed not to give them grace to work them unto faith, but to leave them unto themſelves. And is not this Authour of the ſame opinion? Nay doth he not extend it farther then we doe, even to the Elect, as well as Reprobates? We ſay not ſo, but that his elect he doth not leave unto themſelves to worke out their faith if they can, but workes them by his grace and holy Spirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Himſelfe ſeemes to be conſcious of the falſhood of this his imputation dealing upon the point of God's juſtice. Sub-ſect. 2. For having there propoſed three cauſes
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56120:249"/>
why Reprobates <hi>cannot juſtly be bound to believe;</hi> The ſecond of them was this in M. <hi>Hord's</hi> diſcourſe, <hi>Becauſe it is impoſſible that they ſhould believe; becauſe God hath decreed they ſhall have no power to believe till their dying day.</hi> This reaſon is changed in this Authour's refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that diſcourſe (as indeed all theſe reaſons are changed by him more or leſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out replying upon ought that I have anſwered thereunto, but only putting out, or putting in at his pleaſure, to caſt a ſhew that the former diſcourſe of M. <hi>Hord's</hi> is not anſwered; ſuch is his ſubdolous cariage to undermine that truth, which he is not able to oppoſe in a faire manner with any ſound reaſon; leaſt of all by evidence of Scripture, that flying in his face at every turne; and therefore his beſt wiſdome is to ſhut his eyes againſt it.) And here he ſayth not in repreſenting his ſecond reaſon, that <hi>God hath decreed they ſhall have no power to believe, to their dying day;</hi> but thus rather; <hi>Becauſe it is not God's unfeigned will they ſhall believe.</hi> But now againe in this ſupplement of his, he returnes to the firſt, and ſaith that by our doctrine, <hi>God hath made a decree that ſuch men ſhall never believe. Quo teneam vultus mutantem Protea nodo.</hi> But I confeſſe it is an honour to God's truth, that it cannot be oppoſed, but in ſo vile a manner. Yet I have already ſhewed, that we deny not unto reprobates <hi>a power to believe if they will.</hi> We deny not the miniſtery of the word unto them, exhorting them to believe. We deny not but that whoſoever hath a will to believe, or doth believe, God muſt neceſſarily concurre to the producing of that will, and that act of his. All this we grant, which is the uttermoſt whereunto this Authour comes; but over and above we ſay, that God doth not only give his elect a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to believe if they will, and perſwade them to believe; but that alſo he works them to believe, and not only concurres with them in producing gracious acts, but makes them to concurre with him alſo; this is the grace, and this alone that he denies to reprobates.</p>

Of the fift Section next following; The paſſages out of the ſuffrages of our <hi>Brittain</hi> Divines in the Synod of Dort quoted by M. <hi>Hord,</hi> here they are expreſſed, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>that there are certaine internall workes preparing a man to juſtification, which by the power of the word and Spirit are wrought in the hearts of men not yet juſtified, ſuch as are the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God's will, and ſenſe of ſinne, feare of puniſhment.</hi> Now I have ſhewed that theſe our Brittiſh Divines goe much farther; and yet in their fift Article and fourth poſition, they profeſſe of all ſuch as are none of Gods Elect, that <hi>it is manifeſt they never really and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attaine that change and renovation of the mind and affections, which accompanieth juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nay nor that which doth immediately prepare, and diſpoſe unto juſtification.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the preparation that this Authour ſpeaks of as out of them, muſt needs be a remote preparation. And withall they adde, that <hi>They never ſeriouſly repent, they are never affected with hearty ſorrow for offending God, for ſinning, neither doe they come to any humble contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heart, nor conceive a firme reſolution not to offend any more.</hi> Now let every ſober per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon judge, whether God proceeding no farther with them then this, can be ſaid to intend their converſion and ſalvation. The other poſition of theirs is this, <hi>Thoſe whom God by his word and Spirit affecteth after this manner, thoſe he truly and ſeriouſly calleth and inviteth unto converſion.</hi> I make no queſtion, but whom God calleth, he calleth ſeriouſly, and whom he inviteth unto converſion, that is as I take it, unto repentance, he inviteth truly &amp; ſeriouſly thereunto. But that God intendeth either their converſion or ſalvation, I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny. For did he intend it, undoubtedly he would worke it; For certainly this is in his power. Faith is his gift, and repentance is his gift, and perſeverance in both is his gift. And unleſſe he gives faith and repentance we hold it impoſſible that any man ſhould believe or repent. And what a monſter is it in Divinity to maintaine, that God's inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are fruſtrated, which cannot be maintained without denying God's omnipotency? For no man's intentions are fruſtrated, but becauſe it lyeth not in his power to bring to paſſe the things intended by him.</p>

And firſt it is a thing worthy our conſideration that he ſaith. <hi>It is abſolutely decreed that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels ſhall be damned,</hi> Now if this be true, then the divine decree concerning the damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Divells is an abſolute decree, now this decree is not temporall but eternall. Now if the eternall decree of God concerning the damnation of Divells be abſolute, why ſhould not Gods eternall decree of the damnation of men be abſolute alſo: let him mumble upon this argument and acquaint us with his anſwer thereunto when he thinks good. When he diſcourſeth of the fruitleſſe nature <hi>of the Divells prayers and teares</hi> and endeavours to alter this decree, he ſeemes to me to ſuppoſe that the Divells are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of their free-will <hi>to pray,</hi> and which were more then wonderfull in their ſtate of innocencie, <hi>to ſhed teares and to performe holy endeavours;</hi> and if this were true it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable for us to deny that <hi>Arminians</hi> had the like power left unto them. But if
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56120:250"/>
they have no ſuch freedome of will, what totter tooke this Author to diſcourſe of the fruitleſſe exerciſe of ſuch a power. Would he not think our braine were crackt, if wee ſhould tell him how fruitleſſe his courſe would be to clamber up into the world of the Moone, ſeeing it is as poſſible for him to be Lunatick here, as well as there. Yet if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells have any ſuch freedome of will left them whereby they may attaine to holyneſſe, their endeavours that way though fruitleſſe in reſpect of the altering of Gods decree, yet ſurely would not be fruitleſſe in another reſpect. For better it were by farre, I ſhould think for them to repent and ſubmit to the will of God in ſuffering Hell paines, then to blaſpheme in ſuffering them. But be it ſo, that not only Gods decree be abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their damnation; but that their firſt ſinne did put them quite out of the way, and is to them as death to men. Yet ſuch is not the condition of men. And albeit the decree of damnation both of Divells and men be abſolute, yet neither the one nor the other was decreed to be brought upon them abſolutely, but upon the Angells, in caſe they kept not their owne habitation: upon men in caſe they did not only ſinne, but final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſevere in ſinne without repentance: Though in this reſpect there is no place for the repentance of Angells, yet place there is for the repentance of men, and by repentance to avoid the wrath to come. And laſtly, the Divell knowes his condition to be irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, No man on earth knowes his eſtate to be ſo. For albeit according to our doctrine a man may be aſſured of his election: yet by our doctrine no man can be aſſured of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. Adde this hereunto, Although a man did know he were reprobated to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, yet not knowing to what degree and meaſure of damnation he is ordained, there is place to uſe his beſt endeavours in the way of civilitie and morality, that his dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation may be the leſſe. In caſe he did know this alſo, yet place ſtill remaines to be as morall as he can. For damnation joyned with a condition of better morallity, is better then damnation joyned with a condition of leſſe morality. This may ſuffice as an anſwer to the other inſtances, which are farre more wild then the firſt: as touching the immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ſoule which he ſaith is ſimply decreed; and it is decreed to be immortall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any courſe to be taken by man to promote the immortality thereof: But doe any of our Divines maintaine that God hath decreed our ſalvation in ſuch ſort, as to be brought to paſſe without any courſe to be taken by men of ripe yeares to promote their ſalvation? What proportion is there beetween immortality &amp; ſalvation. God intends ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to no man of ripe yeares, but by way of reward of faith, repentance, obedience and good works. Doth God beſtow immortality upon the ſoule by way of reward? Was not the ſoule of man immortall aſſoone as it was created? Is ſuch the ſalvation of Gods elect? And what giddineſſe poſſeſt the ſpirit of this Author when he diſcourſeth <hi>of the vaine labour of any man, that ſhould uſe meanes that his ſoule ſhould be annihilated?</hi> Suppoſing that ſuch meanes there are, and may be uſed, by the forme of his ſpeech, when he ſayth, that it is labour in vaine for any man to uſe ſuch meanes. As for that which followeth of the Sun and Moone. An inſtance of the ſame nature hath been given in this very Section and an anſwer thereunto accommodated in my refutation of M <hi>Hords</hi> diſcourſe, which this Author could not be ignorant of, as appeares by his altering and changing it almoſt throughout yet takes no notice thereof to reply thereunto, but keeps himſelfe as ſtill as a ſow in beanes, thinking it his ſafeſt courſe to be ſilent. The truth is, God (we ſay) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing ſalvation and inflicting damnation proceeds according to a law, which he hath given unto man: but not ſo in the giving or denying grace, not ſo in ſhewing mercy on ſome and hardning others, but according to the mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And let them that oppoſe it looke well to their waies, leaſt they be not found goatiſh together with their doctrine at the day of judgment.

And indeed I had alſo obſerved other where, that he was a very temperate man, but to this end, that he might take the greater pleaſure in the fleſh, his ſenſes being the more quick, when they were not clogged and overcome with ſurfeit. But come we to <hi>Cicero</hi> his judgment. He takes notice that <hi>Epicurus</hi> was commended as <hi>Comis in amicitiis tuendis, a man of a faire nature in maintaining freindſhip; yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>though theſe things were true (for I affirme nothing) he was not acute enough.</hi> I think this is ſpoken in reference to his doctrine nothing anſwerable to this commendation of him.

Then he takes notice of another commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation given of him, in theſe words, <hi>At multis ſe probavit, he approved himſelfe to many; Et quidem jure fortaſſe, and truly for good cauſe perhaps.</hi> This is <hi>Cicero</hi> his conceſſion with a <hi>perhaps.</hi> But obſerve what he brings in upon the back of this; <hi>Sed tamen non gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſimum eſt teſtimonium multitudinis; but the teſtimony of the multitude (the many) is not moſt weighty,</hi> or moſt conſiderable. <hi>For in every art or ſtudy, or any ſcience, or in vertue it ſelfe, every thing that is beſt, is moſt rare.</hi> Then follow the words which this Authour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeadgeth not, <hi>Ac mihi quidem videtur, quòd ipſe vir bonus fuit.

                  </opener>
                  <p>YOur Letter hath two parts, the one concerning the decree of God, eſpecially in compariſon between a decree indefinite and definite; the other concerning the election of Angels: Of both in order.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="part">
                     <head>I.</head>
                     <p>Concerning the firſt, I will endeavour to ſatisfie you my way; and if that ſucceeds not, to gratifie you your own way.</p>
                     <p>My conceit of a decree indefinite, propoſed <hi>digreſſ.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. you preferre as more <note place="margin">1,</note> ſuitable to my manner of ordering Gods decrees. Three reaſons there I propoſed why I durſt not imbrace that conceit.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt was, becauſe it ſeems to be of a more imperfect nature then is fit to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God.</p>
                     <p>To this is anſwered, that we need not to attribute any ſuch decree to God, but onely to reſolve a definite decree of God into two conceits, according to our apprehenſion, whereof the one is indefinite, the other definite; As in Gods purpoſe to make <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> veſſels of mercy, there are included two conceits in our apprehenſion; the one indefinite, to wit, to make ſome veſſels of mercy; the other definite, to wit, that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall be two of them. You ſeem to approve of this.</p>
                     <p>Now I have cauſe to doubt of the ſoundneſſe of this, for theſe reaſons, 1. If no ſuch decree can be attributed to God, then in vain doe we diſcourſe of the priority there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of before other decrees of God, which indeed are attributed to him, and that decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And indeed all the decrees whereof we diſpute are truely attributed unto God, though they have not that diſtinction one from another in God as the like decrees are diſtinguiſhed in man. And an indefinite decree, reliſhing of imperfection, both in that reſpect cannot be decently attributed unto God, as alſo becauſe it doth imply an indefinite and confuſe knowledge in God. 2. The priority of decrees in God, is onely <hi>ſecundum rationem,</hi> and this <hi>Durand</hi> expounds moſt clearly in this manner, <hi>quando ratio unius ſumitur ab altero,</hi> in 1. diſt. 41. q. 2. ſo <hi>ratio mediorum ſumitur à ratione finis.</hi> But <hi>ratio decreti definiti non ſumitur a ratione deoreti indefiniti.</hi> Becauſe God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſuch an end, therefore God doth appoint ſuch and ſuch means: but it cannot be ſaid, that, becauſe God doth intend to make ſome indefinitely to be veſſels of mercy, therefore he doth intend that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall be two of them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. My two other objections are theſe, Indefinites are before definites onely in ſuch ſort as <hi>communia</hi> are <hi>priora ſpecialibus,</hi> and this is onely <hi>prioritate naturae generantis, non intendentis;</hi> and we ſpeak of priority in intention, not in the way of generation. And again, that which is firſt in the way of generation, is laſt in intention; and therefore this makes rather againſt it, than for it.</p>
                     <p>To this you anſwer, that rather on the contrary <hi>Univerſalia</hi> are <hi>priora ſingularibus, non tam natura generante, quam intendente.</hi> For <hi>Homo prius intenditur quam Socrates: Non enim ſpecies eſt propter Individuum, ſed Individuum propter ſpeciem.</hi> Or, if this be not true <hi>in univerſalibus phyſicis,</hi> yet is it <hi>in politicis ſive aggregatis,</hi> which have a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to our preſent matter.</p>
                     <p>To this I anſwer, 1. The compariſon we ſpeak of between a decree indefinite and definite, is not the ſame with a compariſon between the ſpecies and the ſingular; but only as between ſingulars and ſingulars; ſingulars indefinitely propoſed as <hi>aliqui,</hi> and ſingulars propoſed definitely, as <hi>Hic &amp; ille,</hi> Peter and Paul. Now though <hi>individuum</hi> be <hi>propter ſpeciem,</hi> as that which nature intends principally; and <hi>individua</hi> for the maintenance of the <hi>ſpecies:</hi> yet is it not ſo congruous to ſay, that particulars definite are for particulars indefinite, &amp;c. The inſtance I gave in reducing it to a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon between <hi>generalia</hi> and <hi>ſpecialia,</hi> was to bring it, as neere as I could, to ſuch a State wherein the evidence of truth might plead for it ſelfe. As indeed it is manifeſt, that <hi>generalia</hi> are onely <hi>priora ſpecialibus quoad naturam generantem, ſpecialia priora gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralibus quoad naturam intendentem;</hi> which I delivered out of the remembrance of my old Philoſophy, as a thing which I conceived to be without queſtion. <hi>Zabarell de me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodis lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Ordo naturae non unus eſt, ſed multiplex, vel ſaltem duplex: Non ſolum</hi>

And, after <hi>Suarez</hi> in his Metaphyſicks hath tryed many waies hereabouts, at length reſolves upon <hi>Ariminenſis</hi> his invention, who reduceth it to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods will: and this conceit, after <hi>Suarez,</hi> is embraced with great approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by <hi>Hurtado de Mendoza.</hi> Which becauſe it concerneth a manner of Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and that a very ſtrange one, as they expound it; I have taken occaſion to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it in a peculiar digreſſion.

                     <p>But you think <hi>in univerſalibus Politicis,</hi> as in the gathering of an Army, or erecting of a Colledge, the truth you ſpeak of is more apparent, and the reſemblance more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to the matter in hand. Let us conſider them. A certain number of Souldiers for compleating of an army I confeſſe is intended firſt, afterwards a choyce of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: ſo the maintenance of a certain number of Schollars is intended firſt, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they proceed to the election of Schollers. Here is <hi>totum per aggregationem,</hi> but it is by aggregation of parts in a certain kind, which is of greateſt conſideration, to wit, of parts ſucceeding one another, as a river is ſaid to be one by ſucceſſion of parts which never return. All which parts are impoſſible to be ſubject to the conſideration of the Founder or Generall, becauſe the Colledge continueth long after the Founder is dead, and ſo may the Army alſo, one Generall ſucceeding another by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the State. A more proper reſemblance is found in a man purpoſing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute a ſumme of money to a certain numbr of perſons: as, put the caſe, twenty pound to forty perſons, as a Gentleman hath dealt with our town. The choyce of ſuch perſons as are moſt neceſſitous he leaveth to ſome perſons of truſt. Now, if the Gentleman himſelfe knew of himſelfe every perſon in the Town, and their neceſſitous condition; from the firſt undoubtedly he would appoint, not a certain number indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely to receive it, but aſſigne rather ſuch perſons particularly on whom it ſhould be beſtowed. And in like ſort a Generall were it in his power to leavy whom he liſt, and withall knew for certain every mans ſufficiency, he would from the firſt reſolve upon and deſigne, not onely ſuch a number, but ſuch particular perſons alſo for that ſervice: And, that in the ordinary courſe it is otherwiſe, this proceeds from ſuch an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as is not incident unto God. And laſt of all, both the Generall and the Founder have reſpect to fitneſſe in them whom they chooſe, which it is not in their

Yet <hi>Didacus Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez</hi> ſeems to acknowledge ſuch an indefinite decree, and he is <hi>gravis author</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe: And he plainly profeſſeth, that <hi>permiſſio peccati prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now touching Angels, I pray let not ought that I have written make you ſorry for ought that you have delivered touching the election of Angels: And doe not you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of me amiſſe, as if I did conceive you to harbour any ill opinion thereabouts: For I profeſſe I doe not, neither have you given me any cauſe; yet from nine yeeres of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56120:253"/>
age I have known you. The firſt time I wrote of that, I onely ſaid, <hi>it ſeemed ſtrange unto me;</hi> my reaſon was, becauſe I never knew any, either by writing or otherwiſe, Proteſtant, or Papiſt, ſound in maintaining mans election by grace, but that in like ſort he maintained the election of Angels to be of grace. And whereas you profeſſed otherwiſe onely as an opponent: I conceived you did it but as my ſelfe or any other Schollar will doe, to try the uttermoſt of anothers ſtrength with whom we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
                     <p>But when the ſecond time you wrote hereon, you profeſſed to doubt whether <hi>Arminius</hi> acknowledged any election at all of Angels; that ſeemed to me as ſtrange, becauſe I am perſwaded that no Arminian or Lutheran denieth the election of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: though like enough they are apt to faſhion it according to their opinion of the election of men. As for the conſtruction of that place in <hi>Timothy</hi> touching the <hi>elect Angels,</hi> I could not aſcertain my ſelfe in what ſenſe it might be conceived to proceed without acknowledging their election, and I was loath to divine at random. Now as you expreſſe your ſelfe herein more particularly; ſo will I particularly make anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I grant that a conditionall decree is no election. But ſeeing it is impoſſible but God ſhould foreſee, on whoſe part the condition would be performed, and on whoſe part not; herehence it followeth, that God muſt accordingly Elect the one, and Reprobate the other: and ſo there muſt be acknowledged even an election of Angels after their manner. Like as the Arminians, beſide that conditionall predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of men you ſpeake of, doe acknowledge a preciſe election of ſome upon foreſight of their obedience, and reprobation of the other upon foreſight of their diſobedience.</p>
                     <p>Touching the expoſition of that, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 21. I have conſulted <hi>Hemingius,</hi> a man as erroneous in the point of election as any Lutheran; yet he interpreteth the place thus, <hi>Hos Electos ad diſcrimen Reproborum vocat.</hi> I grant it denotes the dignity of their perſons, but ſtill in reſpect of choice: as when we ſay a choice Book, a choice Jewell, as much as to ſay, which a man would make choice of, and preferre before many: ſo the <hi>Elect Angels</hi> are ſo called in reſpect of choice, which choice to my underſtanding can have no congruous reference, but to the choice of God.</p>
                     <p>It is true we have, nothing like, ſuch Scripture evidence touching the election and reprobation of Angels, as of Men. But whereas in theſe points both Scripture evidence and light of Chriſtian reaſon doe concurre; ſo the light of Chriſtian reaſon doth make it as evident on the part of Angels, as on the part of man; namely, that nothing can poſſibly be the cauſe of Gods will or predeſtination <hi>quoad actum volentis,</hi> or <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinantis.</hi> And <hi>Aquinas,</hi> as you have heard, profeſſeth, <hi>That never any man was ſo mad as to profeſſe, that any thing without God could be the cauſe of predeſtination, quoad actum praedeſtinantis;</hi> and herein you your ſelfe agree.</p>

But herehence it followeth not, that therefore the act of ſtanding was not of Gods grace. But you will ſay the benefit of grace was afterwards manifeſted: And I anſwer, that grace was the grace of confirmation, oppoſite to the Obduration of the evill Angels; which grace of confirmation, though it were manifeſted after the obedience of the good Angels, conſiſting in aſſurance that they ſhall never fall; yet herehence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, that their ſtanding was not by grace, though that grace whereby they ſtood was different from that grace whereby they were confirmed: for before their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo they ſtood, as that withall they might fall; but ſince their obedience they now ſo ſtand, that they cannot fall.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Againe, in your firſt Theſis containing the maine body of your tenet, you will have the foreſight of the ſubject, or occaſion, whereupon any thing is decreed abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to be wrought, alwayes to goe before the decree it ſelfe, as well as the decree of the end goeth before the decree of the meanes.

                     <p n="1">1. If the foreſight of the ſubject and occaſion goes before the decree of working upon the ſubject; then much more muſt the decree of making the ſubject, as alſo of making or permitting the occaſion, goe before the decree of working upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and upon ſuch an occaſion, (for no ſubject whereupon God workes can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods making, but it is nothing ſo with man, who findes ſubjects whereupon to worke rather than makes them) Now this is a thing impoſſible. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt, nothing is firſt in intention but the end, and 'tis not poſſible that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or occaſion ſhould be the end whereunto God workes upon the ſubject thus or thus:</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, that which is firſt in intention is laſt in execution. And therefore if the making of the ſubject, and permitting of the occaſion whereupon God meanes to worke, were firſt in intention, it ſhould be laſt in execution, that is, God ſhould firſt worke upon the ſubject before he had made the ſubject, or permitted the occaſion whereupon he workes.</p>

                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:56120:254"/>
But yet I confeſſe if you have a reaſon for what you ſay, unleſſe you may receive ſome ſatisfactory anſwer unto that reaſon of yours, it will be a very hard matter to ſatisfie you; Therefore I come to the conſideration of your reaſon, which is this.</p>
                     <p>The foreſight of a thing is nothing but the conſideration of it <hi>tanquam reipſa &amp; certo futurum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But whoſo will reſolve abſolutely to work ſuch an effect upon ſuch a definite ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or to make ſuch an uſe of ſuch a particular event, muſt conſider that ſubject and that event <hi>tanquam reipſa futurum:</hi> for elſe his decree will be but conditionall. To this, I anſwer,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt, according to their opinion, that are accounted the moſt rigid interpreters of predeſtination.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Your propoſition is moſt ſound.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As for your aſſumption, which you ſuppoſe to be true, they ſuppoſe to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly untrue; as directly contrary to the moſt generall rules touching the order of things in intention, and execution: And <hi>Alphonſus Mendoza</hi> takes upon him to prove at large, that the ſupernaturals of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were intended before their naturals.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The onely reaſon (ſaving the plauſibility of the propoſition it ſelfe) to juſtifie it, ſeems to be this, God cannot worke upon a ſubject, unleſſe the ſubject firſt be, and that occaſion alſo whereupon he works; therefore God cannot intend to work upon a ſubject unleſſe firſt he intend to produce that ſubject, and permit (at leaſt) the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion whereupon he intends to work. As much as to ſay, becauſe I cannot ride to London without a horſe, therefore I cannot intend to ride to London, unleſſe firſt I intend to get me a horſe. Whence it manifeſtly followeth, that in execution I muſt firſt ride to London, and afterward get me an horſe to that purpoſe. And the confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the order of execution with the order of intention, ſeems to be the cauſe why this propoſition of yours ſeems to be ſo plauſible.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Now I will anſwer your propoſition, according to my own Tenet in ordering Gods decrees, which is likely to give you better ſatisfaction in the way of your own apprehenſion. Now I grant your propoſition; acknowledging that in this caſe ſo it falls out, that he muſt needs conſider the ſubject as <hi>reipſa &amp; certo futurum.</hi> But how, <hi>non tanquam praecedaneum</hi> (whereto your diſcourſe tends) but <hi>tanquam conjunctum;</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe I make the decrees of creation, permiſſion of ſin, and rayſing out of ſin, not <hi>ſubordinata,</hi> but <hi>coordinata &amp; conjuncta.</hi> So I ſay in like manner, God doth joyntly decree to give both grace and glory; I do not ſay God doth decree joyntly to give them, but he joyntly decreeth to give both grace and glory. And ſo <hi>Auſtin</hi> defines predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be <hi>praeparationem gratiae &amp; gloriae.</hi> So that in the ſame moment that he decreeth glory, he conſiders grace not as <hi>praecedaneum in intentione,</hi> but <hi>conjunctum.</hi> So on the other ſide God doth joyntly decree finall dereliction of ſome in ſin and damnation for ſin, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> profeſſeth of reprobation, that it includes <hi>voluntatem permittendi culpam, &amp; damnationem inferendi pro culpa:</hi> ſo that in the ſame moment that he decreeth dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he conſidereth their finall impenitency <hi>non tanquam quiddam antecedaneum,</hi> but <hi>tanquam conjunctum.</hi> And judge you what force this hath to qualifie the harſhneſſe of Tenets hereabouts, and what diſadvantage to our oppoſites the Arminians, who upon the ſubordination of theſe decrees cry out upon our Tenets and expoſe them to oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie, ſaying that we maintaine that God doth firſt decree to damne men, and then to this purpoſe he expoſeth them to ſinne thoſe ſinnes for which they are damned. And herewith they charge the Authors of <hi>Maſſa corrupta</hi> for the object of election and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, aſwell as the Authors of <hi>Maſſa nondum condita,</hi> or <hi>condita,</hi> but <hi>nondum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupta.</hi> And the twenty reaſons which Arminius hath given againſt the Authors of <hi>Maſſa nondum condita;</hi> he profeſſeth that with little difference they may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated againſt the Fautors of <hi>Maſsa corrupta.</hi> All which notwithſtanding, I have conſidered, and I hope refuted alſo, both the one way againſt <hi>Arminius,</hi> and the other way againſt <hi>Corvinus,</hi> in a Digreſſion by it ſelfe, which containes a whole quire of paper, one of them; but that is in my anſwer to <hi>Corvinus,</hi> which is not yet perfected. Doctor <hi>Jackſon</hi> my ancient friend, partly by his traditionary writings that paſſe in hugger-mugger from hand to hand, four pieces whereof as many as I could come by, I have anſwered; and partly by his treatiſe of divine eſſence, withdrawing my ſtudies another away: yet an anſwer to that I hope to ſmith by Whitſontide; and then to return: For in the ſecond part which is newly come forth I finde little conſiderable ſave ſome few chapters touching contingency:
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56120:255"/>
My greateſt buſineſſe about him is to underſtand his language. Now to draw to an end; as your firſt Theſis is an acknowledgement of the eternity of Gods decrees; ſo the ſecond, of their unity both in time and nature, God willing all things <hi>uno &amp; eodem actu.</hi> Now judge I pray whether of the two opinions is moſt ſuitable hereunto; that which makes the decrees of God before ſpoken of, <hi>coordinata &amp; conjuncta,</hi> or that which makes ſuch a concatenation of them by conſequents after conſequents: as for example, Gods decree of raiſing men out of ſin preſuppoſeth the foreſight of ſin; the foreſight of ſinne preſuppoſeth the decree to permit ſin; the decree to permit ſinne ſuppoſeth the foreſight of the futurition of the creature; and the foreſight thereof ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the decree of creation: eſpecially conſidering <hi>Aquinas</hi> his argument, whereby he proves that <hi>praedeſtinatio Chriſti</hi> cannot be the cauſe <hi>praedeſtinationis noſtrae,</hi> to wit, becauſe God by one and the ſame act predeſtinates both Chriſt and us. And withall conſidering that <hi>praerequiſitum</hi> will as much hinder the unity of Gods decrees as <hi>Cauſa.</hi> I had thought to have gone over your Theſes more exactly, but ſeeing the length al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpun out, I reſolve to be the briefer.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Whereas in your third, you conceive the order of Gods decrees is to be underſtood <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>: I judge rather <hi>Durands</hi> inſtruction to be more ſound, before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; to wit, that there is onely <hi>prioritas</hi> amongſt them <hi>ſecundum rationem;</hi> and that he expounds thus, <hi>quando ratio unius ſumitur a ratione alterius,</hi> as <hi>ratio mediorum ſumitur a ratione finis.</hi> And priority in intention is onely of the end in reſpect of means ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereto, as you rightly conceive it in your fourth Theſis.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Of the fifth I have already ſpoken enough, wherein I have laboured partly to diſcover the errour of your argumentation, and yet withall ſo as to give you ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in your own way.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The ſixth containes onely an inference upon the former, and the inference is not ſuitable; for your aſſumption in the former Theſes did but contend, that God muſt conſider it; here you inferre, that he muſt preſuppoſe it; But it followeth not: For to conſider it, 'tis ſufficient that it is <hi>conjunctum;</hi> But to preſuppoſe it is to maintain that it is <hi>antecedaneum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides it is as much peccant againſt the order, between the end and the means, as the former, whereof I have ſpoken ſufficiently.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Of the ſeventh, your reaſon (you confeſſe) is the ſame as before, to wit, in the fifth, which I have already conſidered. Neither is there any neceſſity why one ſhould be before the other: they may, nay muſt be both together intended; For conſider, if the pardoning or curing of ſinne be in intention after the permitting of ſinne, then it ſhould be before it in execution, which were as much as to ſay, that God muſt firſt pardon and cure ſinne, before he can permit ſinne. This is plainly irregular; that irregularity which you conceive on the contrary is onely in ſhew, and riſing meerly from confounding intention with execution. Better to ſay, God doth firſt intend to cure ſinne, and then intends to permit it; (for herehence followeth a due order in execution, to wit, firſt ſinne is permitted, and after cured) then to ſay, God firſt intends to permit ſinne, and after to cure it; for herehence proceeds a moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous order in execution, namely, that firſt ſinne ſhall be cured, and then the being of ſinne permitted. And indeed when men ſay, God doth firſt intend to permit ſinne, and then to cure it, it ſeems their meaning is onely this, not that God doth firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, &amp;c. but that God doth intend firſt to permit ſinne, and then to cure it, which is moſt true.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Like as in your eighth Theſis you doe expreſſe it ere you are aware, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And as in your eighth, ſo in your ninth, you do expreſſe it moſt congruouſly thus, we may conceive God decreeth to permit the occaſion firſt, and afterwards to make that uſe of it which he intends: which I ſay is moſt congruous, conſtituting this prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity onely in execution, not in intention.</p>
                     <p>I come to your concluſions drawn from the premiſes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Gods decree to manifeſt the glory of his power and goodneſſe</hi> ad extra, <hi>is before his decree to create mankind, becauſe that is a decree</hi> de fine, <hi>this</hi> de medio.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. Though this be a truth, yet it is not the whole truth; for it ſeems by power and goodneſſe you underſtand onely that power and goodneſſe which was ſhewed in his creation; but this was not the laſt end: For this end was obtained the very firſt moment of <hi>Adams</hi> creation, after which <hi>Adam</hi> lived above 900 yeeres, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56120:255"/>
ſince, many thouſands, and every one knowes, the laſt end of a mans worke is of chiefeſt conſideration, when he ſets himſelfe to make his worke, neither doth it become the wiſdome of man to carry himſelfe otherwiſe: as <hi>Beza</hi> profeſſeth, ſaying, <hi>Statuere deum prius ordine cauſarum decreviſſe hominem condere, quam quid eo condito faceret deliberaret:</hi> (here is the point, marke it well) is ſuch a thing as <hi>quo nihil abſurdius dici poteſt, quum finis in omnis ſapientis artificis mente praecedat ipſius operis aggreſſionem, ut certiſſimum ſit dei de humano genere decretum, creationem et ipſius creationis fines omnes anteceſſiſſe;</hi> wherein he diſtinguiſheth betweene <hi>finis creationis</hi> and <hi>finis hominis creati.</hi> And as the creation manifeſted his power and goodneſſe in making man out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo man by this almighty power thus made, was made, and intended to be made, to a certaine end; which cannot be imagined to have been in any other kind than to be either a veſſell of mercy, or of wrath.</p>
                     <p>And when <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>God made the wicked againſt the day of evill,</hi> and withall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth that even this alſo was <hi>for himſelfe,</hi> that is, for the manifeſtation of his glory, this cannot be in the way of that power and goodneſſe you ſpeake of, but ſomething elſe; even the making of him a veſſell wherein one day ſhall ſhine the glory of God in the way of juſtice and ſoveraigne power over his creatures.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And therefore it cannot be as you conclude in the ſecond place, that <hi>Gods decree to create mankind is before his decree to manifeſt his mercy or juſtice in mankind.</hi> For though that be a decree to produce a ſubject, yet conſidering that this is the decree touching the end whereto he makes him: in all reaſon the decree of the end whereto a ſubject is made is before the decree of making the ſubject to that end. And we have an expreſſe teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt for this, namely, that as God <hi>created all things for himſelfe,</hi> ſo he created <hi>the wicked againſt the day of evill</hi> for himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>But by the way, I obſerve how you miſtake the opinion of your oppoſites; as when you ſay, that this decree of manifeſting Gods mercy or juſtice, is a decree of working an effect in that ſubject, for this is utterly untrue; This were to make the decree of ſalvation of the one, and of damnation of the other to be before the decree of creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And although ſome ſuch thing may be conceived out of a ſuperficiall appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of it, as propoſed by <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Piſcator;</hi> yet both in true account of that opinion in generall, and miſtaking of it in ſpeciall, no ſuch thing is avouched. Nay, whereas your ſelfe maintaine, that the decree of damnation is before the decree of permiſſion of finall impenitency (a point no way congruous to your Tenet about <hi>maſſa corrupta)</hi> you have often read in my writings, that I account the decree of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in no moment of time to precede the decree of permiſſion of finall impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.</p>
                     <p>Then the caſe of Angells is utterly againſt this; unleſſe you maintaine the one to be elected upon the foreſight of their obedience, the other reprobated upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of their diſobedience: which I am perſwaded you ſhall not find any Orthodox Divine in the point of mans election, to maintaine.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Concluſio tertia. Gods decree to permit ſinne is before his decree to manifeſt either his mercy in pardoning ſinne, or his juſtice in puniſhing ſinne, becauſe that is a decree,</hi> de eventu; <hi>this a doing of ſomething by occaſion of that event.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. To your reaſon here mentioned I have anſwered before.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is no priority or poſteriority in intention, but onely in reſpect of <hi>finis</hi> and <hi>media ad finem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is untrue, that the former decree is a decree of an event, and the latter of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething by occaſion of this event. For what? is Gods permiſſion, the event you meane? If ſo; then Gods working grace may be accounted an event alſo, and ſo Gods decree of ſalvation upon his working grace ſhall follow upon his decree of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king grace, which is manifeſtly Arminianiſme. Is the ſinne permitted the event? Firſt, why ſhould you call it an event? is it becauſe you conceive it to fall out beſides Gods intention? <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe profeſſeth the contrary. The articles of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land profeſſe, that <hi>God from eternity did by his unchangeable counſell ordaine whatſoever in time ſhould come to paſſe,</hi> your ſelfe acknowledge, that Gods decree of permitting ſinne, is a decree <hi>de eventu:</hi> your ſelfe acknowledge, that God did foreſee that man would ſinne in caſe he did permit him to ſinne; which is as much as to ſay ſtice: food did intend that ſinne ſhould come to paſſe by his permiſſion: which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> and expreſſe profeſſion of <hi>Austin</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Non ergo aliquid fit niſi omnipotens fieri velit, vel ſinendo ut fiat, vel ipſe faciendo:</hi> ſo that whether things come to paſſe <hi>Deo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciente</hi>
                        <pb n="184" facs="tcp:56120:256"/>
as good things, or <hi>Deo ſinente,</hi> as evill things; ſtill they came to paſſe <hi>Deo volente</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> profeſſeth. Now this ſinne is apparently the cauſe of the damnation of many thouſands; for as much as many thouſand infants are damned onely for ſinne originall; And therefore like as upon this ſin exiſtent, God doth not take an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion onely, but a cauſe of damning many thouſands; ſo if the decree of permitting this, be preſuppoſed before the decree of damnation, you may ſay as well, that God upon the foreſight of this ſinne, doth not onely take occaſion, but a cauſe alſo, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing their damnation. And this may be applyed to the reprobation, not onely of infants, but of all that are damned, foraſmuch as all that are damned, are damned for originall ſinne, onely here is the difference, ſuch reprobates as dye in their infancy, are damned onely for originall ſinne, but others are damned not only for originall ſinne, but for their actuall ſinnes alſo.</p>
                     <p>Againe it is manifeſt, that the decree of permitting ſinne originall, is no more a decree <hi>de eventu,</hi> and Gods decree to manifeſt his mercy in pardoning it, is a decree of <hi>doing ſomething by occaſion of that event:</hi> than Gods decree of permitting all actuall ſinnes of his elect, from the firſt to the laſt, is a decree <hi>de eventu,</hi> and Gods decree to manifeſt his mercy in pardoning actuall ſinnes, is a decree of working ſomething by occaſion of that event; and I cannot but wonder, this being againe and againe put to your conſideration, that you doe not take notice of the equipollency of theſe: whence it manifeſtly followeth, that the decree of pardoning ſinnes ſhall preſuppoſe <hi>maſſam corruptam,</hi> as well with actuall ſinnes, as ſinnes originall.</p>
                     <p>Againe, if Gods decree of ſhewing juſtice in puniſhing ſinne, is but a decree of <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king occaſion of doing ſomething:</hi> then Gods decree of damnation for mens actuall ſinnes, is but a decree of taking occaſion of doing ſomething; and conſequently, by what reaſon the decree of puniſhing ſinne, preſuppoſeth the decree of permitting ſinne originall, by the ſame reaſon, the decree of damnation, ſhall preſuppoſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of permitting not onely ſinne originall; but all actuall ſinnes alſo.</p>
                     <p>By the ſame reaſon the decree of ſalvation, is but a decree of doing ſomething upon the occaſion of faith, repentance, and good workes. For if ſinne deſerve not to be accounted a cauſe moving God to reſolve to puniſh a man with damnation, but rather an event, by occaſion where of he reſolves to puniſh with damnation: much leſſe ſhall faith, repentance, and good workes be accounted a cauſe moving God to decree to ſave any man, but onely an event, by occaſion whereof, God doth decree ſome mens ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Yet looke by what reaſon the decree of puniſhing with damnation doth preſuppoſe the decree of permitting ſinne, by occaſion of which event puniſhment by damnation is decreed, by the ſame reaſon the decree of ſalvation, doth preſuppoſe the decree of giving faith, repentance, and good workes, by occaſion of which events, ſalvation is decreed; for why ſhould not faith, and good workes be accounted an occaſion of the decree of ſalvation, as well as ſinnes are the occaſion of the decree of damnation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The fourth concluſion is this; <hi>Gods decree to produce the perſon of</hi> Peter, <hi>is before his decree to manifeſt his mercy in</hi> Peter, <hi>by the reaſon aforeſaid,</hi> Theſ. 8.</p>

In like manner, becauſe ſalvation preſuppoſeth all manner of good workes in men of ripe yeeres, therefore the decree of ſalvation, preſuppoſeth the decree of giving effectuall grace, for the performing of all manner of good workes, and the foreſight of them, which is direct Pelagianiſme in the higheſt degree.

                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p n="2">2. Why doe you ſay by occaſion of that ſinne, and not by reaſon of that ſinne? perhaps you will ſay, becauſe that ſinne is not the cauſe of <hi>Judas</hi> his damnation (for I cannot deviſe any other reaſon) but this is not ſound, for that ſinne is the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe of <hi>Judas</hi> his damnation: For though he be damned for actuall ſinnes, yet is he damned for originall alſo? Againe, many thouſand infants are damned onely for originall ſinne.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. May you not as well ſay, that Gods decree to permit <hi>Iudas</hi> his perſonall ſinnes, is before his decree to manifeſt his juſtice in <hi>Iudas</hi> by occaſion of thoſe ſinnes? and conſider I pray how little agreeable that is to your Tenet.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And if the decree of permitting <hi>Iudas</hi> his perſonall ſinnes, be before Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of puniſhing him with damnation, why ſhould not the decree of giving faith, and repentance, and good workes, be before Gods decree of rewarding with ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. I doe not diſlike the order of theſe decrees: but I ſay there is no congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between them, ſuch as ſhould be between the ends, and the meanes. For there is no ſhew of mercy expreſſed in giving faith and repentance; but onely implyed, in as much as both faith and repentance implies, a ſtate of miſery preceding; the permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whereof alone hath congruous reference to the ſhewing of mercy, as the meanes ſtand in congraity to the end. Faith and repentance and good workes are means tending to another end, namely, to the manifeſting of Gods remunerative juſtice: for as much as God meanes to beſtow ſalvation on men of ripe yeares by way of reward of their faith, repentance and good workes. And it is without all contradiction, that in <hi>Peter</hi> and every elect, appeares, not onely Gods mercy, but his juſtice alſo, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56120:257"/>
that in the higheſt degree, both in the pardoning of their ſinnes, and ſaving of their ſoules for the merits of Chriſt Jeſus. And God hath ordained his ſonne to give ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. <hi>Iob.</hi> 17. 2.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And I wonder not a little, that you ſhould ſubordinate any <hi>Medium</hi> tending to the demonſtration of Gods mercy, rather than the permiſſion of miſery.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Eſpecially conſidering, that God when he purpoſed to ſhew mercy on <hi>Peter,</hi> he purpoſed to ſhew mercy on him.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. In pardoning not onely his ſinne originall, but all his actuall ſinnes alſo.</item>
                        <item>2. In ſaving him not onely in deſpight of ſinne originall, but in deſpight of all his actuall ſinnes alſo.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Neither have you any way to avoid this, but by ſaying, that God made <hi>Peter</hi> a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble veſſell of mercy, and that by two decrees, which I thinke was never heard of ſince the world began.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Concluſie Nona; Gods decree to manifeſt his juſtice in</hi> Judas, <hi>or to make</hi> Judas <hi>a veſſell of wrath</hi> (which is properly the decree of reprobation) <hi>is before his decree to deny</hi> Judas <hi>faith and repentance, &amp;c. by the ſame reaſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reſp.</hi> Here againe you erre marvelouſly, in making a <hi>Medium</hi> moſt incongruous to the end intended. To deny faith and repentance, what is it more, than not to give it, and by faith you meane, I doubt not, faith in Chriſt crucified &amp;c. But it is cleare, that God gave no ſuch faith and repentance unto the elect Angells; yet farre be it from us to thinke, that this was a <hi>medium</hi> tending to any end of reprobation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The truth is, nothing but permiſſion of ſinne is a congruous meanes to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting of Gods juſtice. For ſhould God afflict a man or any creature, that is not a ſinner (as <hi>Medina</hi> maintaines <hi>ex communi omuium theologorum ſententia,</hi> he can, and that in the higheſt degree) this ſhall not be in the way of Juſtice vindicative, nor as <hi>Judex,</hi> but as <hi>Dominus vitae et mortis;</hi> like as man hath power to afflict inferiour crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that in ſuch a manner, <hi>non quo illis fiat mitius, ſed quo nobis ſalubrius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Gods juſtice in <hi>Judas</hi> is manifeſted no way more, than in his damnation, and that for actuall ſinne, as well as originall; and in many thouſand infants onely for originall ſinne; and to make the permiſſion of actuall ſinne onely, ſubordinate to the decree of manifeſting Gods juſtice, and not the permiſſion of ſinne originall, is very ſtrange. And <hi>Alvarez</hi> that <hi>gravis Anibor</hi> profeſſeth generally, that <hi>permiſſio peccati prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quod quis damnatur,</hi> is <hi>effectus Reprobationis;</hi> and therefore cannot be premiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. And every man that is damned, is damned for originall, as well as actuall ſinnes, and many thouſand infants onely for originall.</p>
                     <p>As touching the order of decrees ſubjoyned: Had you proceeded thus, God inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded firſt to create, then to permit ſinne, then to raiſe ſome, and finally derelinquiſh others, and laſtly to ſave ſome, and damne others, and that to the manifeſtation of his glory in the way of mercy on the one, and juſtice on the other; it had been exactly agreeable to <hi>Zanchius</hi> his definition of predeſtination. And your ſelfe fall upon ſuch a courſe, ere you are aware, in divers of your Theſes, as I have ſhewed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The firſt being apparently a decree, as concerning the end God aimes at; all the decrees enſuing, ſhould be decrees <hi>de mediis,</hi> tending either to that end, immediatly or mediatly, which you have not explicated, neither indeed are they capable of any ſuch explication: Nay rather you have already manifeſted your meaning to be, that the end there ſpecified, is onely the end of creation; not ſo much as the end of the things created, much leſſe of the things intended by the ſubſequent degrees: yet it is ſet in the firſt place, as though all the things intended in the decrees following, tended to the end mentioned in this decree, beſides all congruity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As touching the foreſight of God interpoſed; The firſt is myſterious, as would manifeſtly appeare, if the ground of it were opened.</p>
                     <p>You thinke that Angells were left to themſelves, yet did not God foreſee that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they would fall, nor that hereupon they would not fall; but that ſome would fall, and others not fall: which <hi>Auſtin,</hi> as I have ſhewed, profeſſeth aroſe from hence; that they which ſtood, had ſuch an <hi>adjutorium,</hi> as they which fell had not: which if it be true, man alſo, had he received the like <hi>adjutorium,</hi> had not fallen.</p>
                     <p>But be it as you will, enquire to what end God ſuffered him to fall, eſpecially this fall of his proving fatall to thouſands; I ſay <hi>this</hi> fall only; it was fatall to all repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, though not onely this fall: for all reprobates are damned for originall ſinne, though not for that onely. The ſecond foreſight is not rightly expreſſed; God cannot
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56120:257"/>
be ſaid to foreſee what he can doe: for onely things to come are ſaid to be foreſeen, things preſent are not: but Gods power whereby he can doe this, or that, is from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting preſent with him.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe you ſee that this order of yours is utterly oppoſite to that maxime, <hi>Quod prius eſt intentione, poſterius eſt executione;</hi> you anſwer, that that maxime holds onely in reſpect of <hi>finis &amp; media ad finem;</hi> and therein you ſay right: But whereas therewithall you imply, that there is another order in intention than between <hi>finis &amp; media,</hi> herein you innovate Philoſophy, and bring in an order in intentions, that was never admitted in any Schooles. I am ſure in <hi>Aquinas</hi> you found no other priority ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittable, but between <hi>finis &amp; media.</hi> And <hi>Durand</hi> acknowledgeth this priority in Gods intentions, to be onely <hi>ſecundum rationem,</hi> and that is, <hi>quando ratio unius ſumitur ab altero.</hi> But where no ſuch priority is found, why ſhould we admit of any priority at all in the decrees of God? yet if you, or any man elſe can make good this new Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, by any reaſon, I ſhall be ready to yield unto it.</p>
                     <p>As for the laſt, give me leave to ſay unto you in <hi>Homers</hi> language <gap reason="foreign">

God created even the wicked againſt the day of evill, and that for Gods own ſake, as <hi>Solomon</hi> teſtifieth: and did he not as well permit him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wicked, for Gods own ſake, and his glories ſake? <hi>Auſtin</hi> of old hath acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that even <hi>malum eſse bonumeſt,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> after him, <hi>Bonum est malum eſse Deo permittente.

And if you marke it well, you ſhall find, that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, is the ſame propoſition in effect, the beſt proofe whereof that I found, I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to overthrow, by ſhewing the inconſequence thereof divers wayes. And ſeeing you rely finally hereupon without proofe, you begge the queſtion, and inſtead of giving a new reaſon, you give none at all. And the truth is, I find many apt to be carried away with the plauſible ſhew of this propoſition, and either looke not at all farther for any proofe thereof, or if they doe, they proceed no farther than thus. The manifeſtation of mercy in ſparing, and juſtice in puniſhing, preſuppoſeth ſinne; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the decree (or intention) of manifeſting Gods mercy in ſparing, and juſtice in puniſhing, preſuppoſeth ſinne, which was in effect the ſame conſequence or enthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meme, which I propoſed to anſwer, as you may eaſily perceive if you marke it well: for commiſeration and manifeſtation of mercy are all one. Now becauſe this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is ſuch a witch to bewitch mens fancies to entertaine it, I will endeavour to diſcover the vanity of it, and that in the very decrees of men, all which are temporall, whereas Gods decrees were eternall.</p>
                  <p>The decree of ſhewing mercy in pardoning ſinne doth no more preſuppoſe ſinne, than the decree of ſhewing the power of balme in curing a green wound, doth preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the wound, or the decree of ſhewing the power of a cordiall againſt poyſon, doth preſuppoſe the empoyſoning of a mans body; or the decree of advancing a ſubject by way of reward, doth preſuppoſe his ſervice: or the decree of a Patron; to preſent his ſonne to a benefice, doth preſuppoſe his fitneſſe for it, or the decree of <hi>Solomon</hi> to bring <hi>Shimei</hi> his gray haires unto the grave in bloud, did preſuppoſe the offence for which this was brought to paſſe; but rather from theſe decrees and intentions, each Author in his kind proceedeth to bring to paſſe every thing that is required to the accompliſhment of that end which he requires; As I prove by inſtance in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. 1. I have knowne one, that to ſhew the power of his balme, hath wounded his owne fleſh, and pouring his balme into it, hath cured it in the ſpace of twenty foure houres. Aske wherefore he wounded his fleſh, every one ſeeth, that both he woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, and healed it with his balme, to make the vertue of his balme knowne: So that his intention of manifeſting the vertue of his balme, did not preſuppoſe the wound but drew after it, both the making of the wound, and the pouring of balme into it, as the meanes tending to the demonſtration of the power of the balme. 2. So we have knowne another to take poyſon, and afterward his cordiall againſt it, both the one, and the other, joyntly tending to the manifeſtation of the vertue of his cordiall. 3. A King intending to promote a favourite, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to doe it without envy of the Nobility, may reſolve to doe it by way of reward, which purpoſe preſuppoſeth not good ſervice, but rather hereupon he
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56120:259"/>
will imploy him in ſervice, as in ſome honourable Embaſſage, or in the Warres, to the end that he may have occaſion to advance him upon his ſervice, without envy of the Nobles. 4. A Patron having a young ſonne, may entertaine a reſolution to beſtow a living upon him when time ſerves; This intention doth not preſuppoſe his fitneſſe, (without which he cannot be admitted) but becauſe he hath a purpoſe to preferre him thereunto, therefore he will take order to bring him up like a Schollar, and ſend him to the Univerſity to make him fit. 5. Laſt of all, <hi>Solomon</hi> you know upon <hi>Davids</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition on his death bed, entertained an intention to bring <hi>Shimei</hi> to his grave in bloud, yet not for his curſing of <hi>David,</hi> but for a new tranſgreſſion; therefore he takes a courſe to enſnare him, and bids him to build him an houſe in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and not to paſſe over the Brooke <hi>Kidron</hi> upon paine of death. Now it was not indeed in <hi>Solomons</hi> power effectually to enſnare him, and ſo certainely to bring upon him the execution of death: But this is in the power of God; For let him but expoſe any creature unto temptation, and derelinquiſh him therein, without giving him his grace to ſupport him, that creature ſhall certainely fall into ſinne, otherwiſe if any creature can keepe himſelfe from ſinne without Gods grace, then Gods grace ſhall not have the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of being the cauſe of every good action; But this prerogative of Gods grace muſt and by Gods grace ſhall be maintained unto the end. And upon this foundation the prerogative of his ſoveraigne power alſo over his creatures in diſpoſing of them as he thinkes good, and making ſome veſſells of mercy and ſome of wrath, which <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe profeſſeth he dares not deny to be in the power of God, to wit, to make veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of mercy and veſſells of wrath, and that <hi>ex maſſa nondum condita,</hi> in his Analyſis of the ninth to the Romans.</p>
                  <p>But I proceed to the forme of your Syllogiſme.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The reaſon (you ſay) may be laid downe Syllogiſtically thus: <note place="margin">H.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. God could not intend to pardon any without ſuppoſition of that, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required to make them capable of pardon: But ſinne is neceſſarily required to make them capable of pardon; therefore God could not intend to pardon any without ſuppoſition of ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God could not intend to puniſh any without conſideration of that, which is in juſtice required to make them puniſhable: But ſinne is required in juſtice to make any perſon puniſhable; therefore God could not intend to puniſh any without conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. In both Syllogiſmes the Minor we grant, the Major we deny, as being in <note place="margin">T.</note> effect the very ſame propoſition which is in queſtion; and all the evidence it carryeth with it conſiſteth in the parts which have a ſhew of an Enthymeme thus:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sinne is neceſſarily prerequired to the pardoning of ſinne, therefore it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily prerequired to the decree of pardoning ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sinne in juſtice is prerequired unto puniſhing, <hi>Ergo</hi> 'tis in juſtice prerequired to the decree of puniſhing.</p>
                  <p>Now this is the very proofe which formerly I laboured to diſprove, by ſhewing the inconſequence thereof, yet the propoſition whereon you rely, either muſt depend upon this proofe, or upon none at all. But I will proceed with you a little farther upon theſe Syllogiſmes you propoſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sinne (you ſay, and that truly) is neceſſarily required to make men capable of pardon. And this generall truth brancheth it ſelfe into two ſpecialls:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sinne originall is neceſſarily required to make men capable of pardon for ſinne originall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sinne actuall is neceſſarily required to make men capable of pardon for ſinne actuall.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe God doth intend to pardon all the ſinnes of his elect, not onely origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall but actuall, committed throughout the whole courſe of his life, it followeth that God could not intend to pardon theſe actuall ſinnes without the preſuppoſition of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By the ſame reaſon of yours I diſpute thus:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God could not intend to beſtow ſalvation upon any man by way of reward without ſuppoſition of that which is neceſſarily required to make him capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But the obedience of faith, repentance, and good workes, is neceſſarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make a man capable of reward, <hi>Ergo,</hi> God could not intend to beſtow ſalvation on any man by way of reward, without ſuppoſition of faith, repentance and good workes.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:56120:259"/>
2. As God cannot intend to puniſh any without conſideration of that, which in juſtice is required to make him puniſhable: ſo God cannot intend to puniſh any in ſuch a degree, without that which is required in juſtice to make him puniſhable in ſuch a degree. Now not onely ſinne originall, but all actuall ſinnes of every Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, together with their finall impenitency therein, is required in juſtice to make every one of them puniſhable in ſuch a degree; <hi>Ergo,</hi> could not God intend to puniſh any Reprobate in ſuch a degree, without conſideration of all their actuall ſins.</p>
                  <p>And as mens actuall ſinnes are the meritorious cauſes of their damnation: ſo the conſideration of them ſhall be the meritorious cauſe of their reprobation, or at leaſt, of that decree whereby God doth decree to inflict damnation upon them in ſuch a degree.</p>
                  <p>And by juſt proportion of reaſon, like as faith, repentance, and good workes are the diſpoſing cauſes unto ſalvation, ſo the conſideration of faith, repentance, and good workes ſhall be the diſpoſing cauſes of their election unto ſalvation: But you proceed, and I am content to go along with you.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And this reaſon, eſpecially for the latter part of it, which concernes the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation <note place="margin">H.</note> of Gods glory <hi>per m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dum juſtitiae punientis,</hi> may be farther confirmed thus: That which tends not to Gods glory ſimply, but onely upon ſuppoſition <hi>[if ſinne be]</hi> could not be intended by him ſimply, but onely upon that ſuppoſition. For ſo farre and no farther doth God intend any thing, as it makes for his glory: But to puniſh men, or any other creatures, is a thing that tends not to Gods glory ſimply, but onely upon ſuppoſition (if ſinne be) <hi>Ergo,</hi> it could not be intended by God ſimply but onely upon that ſuppoſition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> You need not have mentioned the tending of this to Gods glory: your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <note place="margin">T.</note> is in force, and greater force without it. For I hold, that to puniſh without ſuppoſition of ſinne implyeth contradiction: <hi>paena</hi> being properly oppoſed to <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium,</hi> and as reward formally hath a reſpect to obedience going before, ſo hath pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment unto ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Now firſt to follow you in your owne courſe, I reaſon thus; That which tends to Gods glory not ſimply, but onely upon ſuppoſition of obedience in faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and good workes, cannot be intended by him ſimply, but upon that ſuppoſition; but to reward with ſalvation, and everlaſting life, tends not to Gods glory ſimply, but onely upon ſuppoſition of faith, repentance and good workes. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it could ot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by God ſimply, but onely upon faith and repentance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But to your <hi>Major</hi> I anſwer; No man ſaith, that God doth intend to puniſh any man but for ſinne. Now hereupon many (not onely Arminians, but ſome Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox alſo) are apt to be deceived, and to thinke, that theſe words, <hi>but for ſinne,</hi> are to be referred to the Antecedent removed, which is Gods intention. But it is not ſo, thoſe words are onely to be referred to the Antecedent next before, which is to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. And I prove it thus: When any man ſaith, God intends to puniſh man for his ſinne, the meaning can be no other, than if he had ſaid, God doth intend, that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be inflicted on man for his ſinne; where it is manifeſt, that ſinne is noted onely as going before the puniſhment, not as going before Gods intention. But as ſoone as this confuſion of ſenſe is opened by diſtinction, then they flye to this kind of argument, ſinne goeth before the execution of puniſhment, therefore the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinne goeth before the intention of puniſhment, which is the argument I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly propoſed, and the inconſequence whereof I preſume you doe manifeſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
                  <p>Now to that which followeth:</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Although the reaſon which you alledge on our behalfe be inconſequent, as you <note place="margin">H.</note> have framed it: yet I ſuppoſe it may be reduced to a true Syllogiſme thus:</p>
                  <p>The decree of liberation from ſinne, preſuppoſeth ſinne: election is the decree of liberation from ſinne, <hi>Ergo,</hi> election preſuppoſeth ſinne. If you deny the Major, I prove it thus:</p>
                  <p>That which preſuppoſeth ſinners, preſuppoſeth ſinne. The decree of liberation from ſinne, preſuppoſeth ſinners: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the decree of liberation from ſinne, preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſinne; you will perhaps yet deny the Minor; but I prove it thus: The decree of liberation from ſinne, preſuppoſeth ſome that have need to be delivered, for elſe it were vaine, and to no purpoſe: Onely ſinners have need to be delivered from ſinne: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the decree of liberation from ſinne preſuppoſeth ſinners.</p>
                  <p>The like argument, and in the like forme, may be framed touching the decree of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56120:260"/>
dereliction in ſinne: Or if you take reprobation for the decree of damnation, it may be ſaid thus:</p>
                  <p>The decree of damnation, preſuppoſeth ſome perſons juſtly damnable, for otherwiſe it were either an unjuſt, or at leaſt and unwiſean indeliberate decree. But onely ſinners are juſtly damnable. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the decree of damnation preſuppoſeth ſinners, and conſe quently ſinne. For <hi>peccatum</hi> is <hi>de formali ratione peccatoris qua peccator est,</hi> as you know.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> Every one indeed knowes that <hi>peccatum</hi> is <hi>de formali ratione peccatoris,</hi> and hereupon it is manifeſt that the ſecond Syllogiſme gives no mite of proofe unto the <note place="margin">T.</note> firſt. For ſeeing <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of any thing, cannot be ſeparated from the thing it ſelfe, and conſequently neither <hi>peccatum</hi> from <hi>peccator;</hi> you may eaſily perceive, that when we deny that the decree of liberation from ſinne preſuppoſeth ſinne, we muſt therewithall neceſſarily deny, that it preſuppoſeth ſinners.</p>
                  <p>Your third Syllogiſme addeth as little force unto the former, being meerly <hi>identica probatio:</hi> For every man knoweth, that to be a ſinner, and to have need to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from ſinne is all one, in ſuch ſort as whatſoever is denyed of a ſinner, muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed of him that hath need to be delivered from ſinne, foraſmuch as every ſinner hath need to be delivered from ſinne. Thus while you decline that proofe, which in my obſervation, alone hath courſe, and the implication whereof in the Major propoſition is all the evidence of it; you fall upon no ſound proofe at all. The truth is, if you obſerve, you may perceive your Major propoſition involves this Enthymeme.</p>
                  <p>Liberation from ſinne preſuppoſeth ſinne, ſinners ſuch as have need to be delivered from ſinne, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the decree of liberation from ſinne, preſuppoſeth both ſinne and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſuch as need to be delivered from ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Of any other force of proofe that you give, I am not conſcious.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the argument formed touching the decree of dereliction in ſinne, be of the like forme, it will admit no doubt the ſame anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Major of the laſt Syllogiſme, hath a clauſe annexed unto it, as a reaſon of it, thus, <hi>elſe it were in vaine and to no purpoſe.</hi> If this reaſon pleaſed you, you might have relyed upon it, in the firſt Syllogiſme of the three, whereas now you may perceive, they containe no proofe but identicall. 2. Your courſe of argumentation tends to prove, that it is impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe than you conceive, which is more than to ſay, it were otherwiſe onely vaine, and to no purpoſe. Thirdly I anſwer that which is vaine, and to no purpoſe, is either to no end, or to no good end: But the decree of liberation from ſinne, whether it preſuppoſe ſinne, as you ſay, or not preſuppoſe ſinne, as I ſay, ſtill it tends to the ſame end, and that a good end, to wit, the manifeſtation of Gods mercy.</p>
                  <p>But I erre, your meaning ſeemeth to be this, it is vaine in reſpect that it cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the end it aimes at, unleſſe it preſuppoſe ſinne. But how doe you prove that Gods decree of liberation from ſinne, cannot take effect, except it preſuppoſe ſinne? you have no meanes to prove it but this:</p>
                  <p>Liberation from ſinne cannot take effect without it preſuppoſe ſinne, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the decree of liberation from ſinne cannot take effect without it preſuppoſe ſinne. And while you decline this way of proofe, you light upon no proofe at all.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Touching your laſt Syllogiſme, I deny your Major, that is, I deny that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of damnation preſuppoſeth perſons juſtly damnable. Then you ſay it is unjuſt; but I deny this conſequence, and though you bring no farther reaſon for your affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, yet will I prove my negation thus:</p>
                  <p>The decree of damnation for finall perſeverance in ſin, no man will ſay, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt: But God decrees to damne no man but for finall perſeverance in ſinne, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Gods decree of damnation is not unjuſt. Here I ſuppoſe you will reply, that if God decreeth to damne no man but for finall perſeverance in ſinne, then it followeth, that the decree of damnation preſuppoſeth not onely ſinne in generall, but finall perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and ſo you may thinke my opinion more diſſolute than yours, and your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion more rigid than mine. And I doubt not, but ſo it will appeare in the end, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the point of election; but yet not for any force in this conſequence.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I anſwer, that this conſequence is very unfound, though it hath decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many, and though the uſuall courſe is, to content themſelves with propoſing it, without all proofe, thinking it needeth no proofe; yet will I eaſily diſprove it, and ſhew the vanity of it, as already I have done the like. Now I pray what is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this, God doth not decree to damne any man but for finall perſeverance in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56120:260"/>
ſinne? hath it any other meaning than this, God doth not intend, that damnation ſhall be afflicted on any man, but for his finall perſeverance in ſinne goeth before damnation; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the conſideration of finall perſeverance in ſinne goeth before the decree of damnation. The inconſequence whereof I have formerly ſhewed, neither doe I finde any exception you make againſt my courſe in diſcovering it. And by the way give me leave to tell you, what I ſeeme to have found in the courſe of my ſtudies in theſe points: Arminianiſme and Pelagianiſme is one of the unlearnedſt hereſies that ever was, depending meerly either upon principles, which they eſtabliſh to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at pleaſure without all ground, or upon conſequences, moſt inconſequent; yet both their principles, and their conſequences are very plauſible at firſt ſight to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Tenets themſelves, moſt apt to bewitch carnall affections. And if the Trumpets in the Revelation doe containe a prediction of hereſies growing upon the Church, as moſt have thought, (though now adayes it begins otherwiſe to come about) and the ſtarre called wormewood, as a ſtarre ſignifieth ſome plauſible Hereſie, as Piſcator conjectureth; I ſee none ſo fit as the Pelagian Hereſie to be notified here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, though as bitter as wormewood in oppoſing the grace of God; in maintaining the prerogative whereof, how can it be but he ſhould be zealous, that hath taſted of it, and of Gods goodneſſe in making him a veſſell of mercy, when he might have made him a veſſell of wrath. But you proceed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Whereas you argue, that if election preſuppoſe originall ſinne, it preſuppoſeth <note place="margin">H.</note> actuall ſinnes alſo. I anſwer, it followes not: For though God hath decreed to free his elect from all their actuall ſinnes, as well as from their originall, yet he hath not done it by one and the ſame decree: But firſt he hath reſolved to free them from that generall curſe, and malediction, whereto they were obnoxious in <hi>Adam,</hi> and this is included in their very election; afterward he hath reſolved to purge them alſo from all their actuall ſinnes, which they ſhall commit by the effectuall application of Chriſts merit, and this is by another decree conſequent upon their election, being one of his decrees <hi>de mediis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> Herein you carry your ſelfe like a right Schollar, in making way out though it be a new way. As if the decree of freeing from Originall ſinne, were a different <note place="margin">T.</note> decree from the decree of freeing from ſinnes actuall, and before it. And albeit the actuall ſinnes of Gods elect are many and much different, ſome committed before their calling, and for many yeares, ſome committed after their calling, throughout the whole courſe of their lives, yet you can be content to make the decree of God in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from all theſe, to be but one decree; onely the decrees of freeing from actuall, and from originall ſinnes muſt be different decrees.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When you ſay, firſt he hath reſolved to free them from originall ſinne, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he hath reſolved to purge them from actuall ſinnes, I doubt your meaning is no more but this, God hath reſolved firſt to free them from originall ſinne, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to purge them from actuall ſinnes. And my reaſon is, becauſe many times I have obſerved ſpeeches to ranne thus, when the meaning hath beene but ſo as I have expreſſed. But I will manifeſt, that in the execution, freeing from malediction in <hi>Adam,</hi> and purging from actuall ſinnes goe together: much leſſe can they differ in intention; which I prove thus: No man is delivered from the malediction, whereto he was obnoxious in <hi>Adam,</hi> but by faith in Chriſt, he is therewithall freed from all his actuall ſinnes committed before his calling: Therefore ſeeing they are at once freed from malediction in <hi>Adam,</hi> and from many actuall ſinnes, it followeth that God did intend at once thus to free them; and how could this be done by different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, one going before another?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now I will prove, that God did at once intend to free from all ſins, both actuall and originall, though he did not intend, that this ſhould be done at once; Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as actuall ſinnes are committed ſucceſſively, one a long time after another.</p>
                  <p>God intending to give faith and repentance to his elect, did therewithall intend to free them from all their ſinnes, for theſe are the onely meanes whereby we are freed from ſinne. But God did at once intend to give faith and repentance to his elect: <hi>Ergo.</hi> He did at once intend, to free them from all their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this argument, the greateſt colour of exception is from the conſideration of actuall ſins, that have their courſe after their calling. But this again is as eaſily remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by conſideration, that as ſins have their courſe, ſo faith and repentance have their courſe; and God intended at once to give his elect faith and repentance, and finall
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56120:261"/>
perſeverance in both, though perſeverance cannot be had at once, that being againſt the nature of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whereas you ſay onely of actuall ſins, that we are purged from them by the effectuall application of Chriſts merits; I hope your meaning is not, to exclude the purgation of originall ſin, and liberation from malediction in <hi>Adam</hi> from the effect of Chriſts merits. The blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin. And <hi>David</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of his originall ſin, as well as of his actuall, and ſo doe we. And when in reſpect of <hi>the law of his members, leading him captive to the law of ſinne,</hi> the Apoſtle cries out, <hi>wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me, &amp;c.</hi> Immediately he comforteth himſelfe in this manner, <hi>I thank my God through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. When you ſay, that Gods decree of purging us from actuall ſins, is one of the decrees <hi>de mediis,</hi> you doe not tell us what you call that other decree, whereby God decreeth to free us from that generall curſe and malediction whereto we were obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in <hi>Adam.</hi> But by the difference you put, you leave us to interpret it, of Gods decree <hi>de fine:</hi> Now there is no ſuch proportion, or diſproportion between theſe decrees, that the decree of freeing from originall ſin, or from the malediction in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhould be <hi>decretum de fine,</hi> and the decree of purging from actuall ſins, ſhould be <hi>decretum de mediis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the end of Gods actions is meerely his own glory, according to that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 4. <hi>God made all things for himſelfe,</hi> and that <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 4. laſt, <hi>from him and for him are all things.</hi> The freeing from ſin Originall &amp;c. may be a means to this, it cannot be the end which God intends.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If ſalvation be conſidered as the end which God intends, as commonly Divines conſider it, (though this courſe of conſideration hath been the mother of great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation, in the ordering of Gods decrees) yet freedom from ſin originall, is rather a means to this: Therefore not to be accounted the object of Gods decrees concerning the end. Again, who doubts, but that the freeing from ſin originall, is as well a means of ſalvation, as the purging from ſins actuall. Therefore the decree thereof is to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned amongſt the number of the decrees <hi>de mediis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yet will not this ſuffice, to make the decree of freeing from ſin originall, to be different from the decree of purging from ſins actuall, as this is accounted a decree <hi>de mediis:</hi> unleſſe the freeing from ſin originall be the end, and the purging from ſins actuall a means tending to that end. For priority and poſteriority in intention, hath no place, but by reaſon of mutuall reſpect between the end and the means ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that end. But in no congruity can it be ſaid, that the purging us from ſins actuall is a means to free us from ſins originall, or from that malediction, whereto we were obnoxious in <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. If freeing from originall ſin be firſt in Gods intention, and afterwards the purging of us from ſins actuall; it followeth, that the freeing from originall ſin ſhall be laſt in execution, ſo that God ſhall firſt free us from actuall ſins, and then proceed to free us from originall ſin. I proceed to the next.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In like manner we ſay of the Reprobate: It is one decree whereby God reſolves <note place="margin">H.</note> to leave them in the State of originall ſin, another whereby he doth reſolve to leave them in their actuall ſins alſo; And although this latter doth follow alwaies upon the former, yet the former is onely properly called reprobation. Wherefore it followeth not, that if the decree of reprobation ſuppoſeth originall ſin, it ſuppoſeth actuall alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. The anſwer unto the former may in every particular be accommodated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">T.</note> this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe you ſpeak of are not different, but one decree, and the ſame: As I prove thus; Gods decree to leave them in the ſtate of originall ſin, is all one with Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree finally to deny them faith and repentance: And Gods decree finally to deny them faith and repentance is all one with Gods decree to leave them in their actuall ſin. Alſo Reprobation, as it ſignifieth Gods decree of leaving in the ſtate of ſin, was never conceived to be other, then the decree of denying them faith and repentance unto the end: which whether it be not a decree of leaving them in actuall ſins as well as ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, let any man judge. For God by this decree of finall d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="7">7. Although God doth actually damne men as well for their actuall ſins, as for their <note place="margin">H.</note>

originall: yet the foreſight of originall ſin, being enough to ſalve Gods juſtice in the decree of damnation, we are not compelled to grant any more, as antecedent to that decree, but may take in the reſt, as conſequent rather.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> As God doth actually damn men aſwel for their actual ſins, as for their originall; <note place="margin">T.</note> ſo undoubtedly God did from everlaſting decree to damn them for their actuall ſins as wel as for their originall. For when God doth actually damn them for their actuall ſins, then undoubtedly he doth will to condemne them, otherwiſe he ſhould damne them againſt his will: Now the will of God, being an eternall action, is eternall; therefore from everlaſting he did will to damne them for actuall ſinnes: For his will to damne them, and his decree to damne them is all one. Now I think you doe not make two decrees of damnation of the ſame men, one for their originall, another for their actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſins: Therefore in the ſame moment that he decreed to damne for ſin originall, he did decree to damne for actuall alſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the foreſight of ſinne be required to ſalve Gods juſtice in the decree of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of men of ripe yeeres; the foreſight of originall ſinne will not ſerve the turn: For ſeeing God doth not intend the damnation of man indefinitely, in reſpect of the degrees thereof, but definitely, that is, according to the very degree in which he will inflict damnation; It is manifeſt, that foreſight of originall ſinne cannot ſalve Gods juſtice. For to intend damnation in ſuch a degree as is due onely to ſins actuall, upon foreſight onely of ſinne originall, is as unjuſt, as to intend damnation upon no foreſight of ſinne at all: For even in this caſe you allow, that as ſome degrees inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded are due to ſinne originall, upon foreſight whereof alone, they are intended; ſo again ſome degrees intended, are due onely to actuall ſinnes, upon no foreſight where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in your opinion they are intended.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is very ſtrange, that you ſhould maintaine, Gods courſe is juſtified in decreeing to damne upon foreſight of originall ſinne, and not upon the foreſight of actuall ſins: whereas damnation for originall ſinne onely, is ſo farre from being juſtifiable in the ſight of fleſh and blood, as that it is indeed the ſecond degree of the greateſt abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Gods power, that ever was or ſhall be ſhewed in this world, or in the world to come.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The firſt degree and greateſt, was the crucifying of the ſame God for others ſins, being without all ſin of his own.</item>
                     <item>2. The ſecond is the damnation of Infants, for the ſin of <hi>Adam;</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, notwithſtanding, we believe to be ſaved.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="4">4. I pray conſider the difference betwixt your opinion and minde; you maintaine that God decreed to damne all reprobates before the foreſight of any of their actuall ſinnes: I no way like this Tenet, but maintaine, that in the ſame moment, that God decrees to damne any Reprobate, he decrees to damne him for all his actuall ſins, aſwell as originall ſinne, and finall perſeverance in them; And that in the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he foreſaw all their ſins: not that the foreſight of their ſinnes is antecedent or ſubſequent to, but concomitant or conjunct with his decree of their damnation, in the ſame moment, not of time onely, but of nature alſo.</p>
                  <p>Undoubtedly actuall ſinnes are more apt to juſtifie God in damning any man, than ſinne originall; yet you maintaine that God decrees to damne a man, without the foreſight of that, which doth more juſtifie God in damning any man; onely you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that he can decree to damne any man, without the foreſight of that, which doth leſſe juſtifie God in the actuall damnation of any one.</p>
                  <p>You will have the foreſight of mans actuall ſins to follow the decree of damnation, which I dare not avouch, not onely becauſe it is harſh to mens affections, but becauſe it is repugnant in my judgement to manifeſt reaſon; onely I deny the foreſight of all ſinnes to be antecedent to this decree: I ſay, tis neither antecedent to it, which is the diſſolute opinion, nor ſubſequent after it, which is the rigid opinion, and each of them equally untrue; but it is conjunct or concomitant to it, in the ſame moment of nature: both theſe degrees being the decrees <hi>de mediis,</hi> and ſo making up one formall compleat decree <hi>de mediis ad eundem finem tendentibus,</hi> which is the manifeſtation of Gods glory in the way of juſtice; as I have ſhewed at large in my third digreſſion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe which I heare are lately brought into your hands. But I wonder not a little what you are fallen upon in the next place.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. As touching the election and reprobation of Angells I have nothing to ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">H.</note> the Scripture ſaith nothing. It is true, that it could not be made <hi>ex communi</hi>

But in this point not one is for you; nor ever could I obſerve any of our Divines that maintained not the election of Angells, to be of as free grace as the election of men, or the reprobation of Angells, to be of as free Soveraignty and abſoluteneſſe in the denyall of grace, as the reprobation of men.</p>

                  <p>But though you ſee no great matter to object againſt it, yet others doe, that hold it abſolutely impoſſible to be otherwiſe; namely impoſſible, that any thing in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould be the cauſe of the will of God <hi>quoad actum volentis;</hi> or of predeſtination, <hi>quoad actum praedeſtinantie,</hi> Inſomuch that <hi>Aquinas</hi> profeſſeth, <hi>never any man was ſo mad, as to maintaine that there could be any cauſe of the will of God.</hi> p. 1. q. 23.

                  <p n="2">2. Are they not called in Scripture the elect Angells? Now marke <hi>Auſtins</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; If upon the foreſight of mans obedience God elect any man, it ſhall not be ſaid, <hi>Non vos me elegiſtis, ſed ego vos elegi;</hi> but on the contrary rather, <hi>vos me elegiſtis non ego elegi vos.</hi> For if election of Angells followed upon their obedience, they did firſt chooſe God, that is, chooſe to obey him, before God did chooſe them, that is, chooſe to ſave them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If Angells were elected upon their obedience, then either by neceſſity of nature this came to paſſe, or by the free conſtitution of God; It cannot be ſaid, by neceſſity of nature, <hi>Ergo</hi> by his free conſtitution, whence it followeth, that God did ordaine, that upon the obedience of Angells he would ordaine them to eternall life. Now judge you whether one decree of God can poſſibly be the object of another decree, all decrees of God being eternall; and the objects of Gods decrees being meerely tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall: as appeares in the decree of creation, preſervation, redemption, vocation, juſtification, ſanctification, ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. No good act can be wrought but by God, and by his grace; it is he that workes in us both the will and the deed of his good pleaſure; Doe you not thinke it is ſo in Angells alſo? otherwiſe what cauſe have they to give God thankes for their election, as namely, if it ſprang from their obedience.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe you deny this; yet all confeſſe no naturall action can be wrought (much leſſe gratious) without Gods concourſe, as the efficient cauſe thereof.

                     <hi>poteſt.</hi> But this I have farther proſecuted in a Digreſſion by it ſelfe, proving that God doth determine the will to every act thereof, and ſhewing the great concurrence herein, (and upon what grounds) of ſchoole Divines, from <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> his dayes downwards. But I proceed with you.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. To that which you ſay concerning infants, I thinke I may anſwer, that although <note place="margin">H.</note> there were no other thing that made way to their ſalvation, or damnation, but onely the fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> yet it followeth not, that God decreed to permit <hi>Adams</hi> fall, as a <hi>Medium</hi> tending thereunto. For what if he decreed to ſave or damne ſome <hi>ſine me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diis,</hi> ſuppoſing them in a ſtate immediately capable of ſalvation or damnation, as by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and their originall ſinne contracted hereupon, they were? yet I adde far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, concerning infants that are ſaved; there is ſomewhat elſe decreed to make way to their ſalvation, beſides <hi>Adams</hi> fall: namely an application of Chriſts merit to them in baptiſme, or otherwiſe. And for thoſe that are damned; ſince their originall ſinne makes them immediately juſtly damnable, it was enough for God to decree to leave them in the ſtate they were, and ſo to damne them; there being no other remedy to bring to paſſe his end in the matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> In generall obſerve I pray you the diſproportion of your Tenet concerning <note place="margin">T.</note> Infants, and others.</p>
                  <p>God doth not decree to damne Infants (as you ſay) but upon the foreſight of all the ſinne, for which they are damned; but God doth decree to damne all others, not upon the foreſight of all their ſinnes for which they are damned, nor upon the foreſight of thoſe ſinnes for which they are chiefly damned, and which doe juſtifie God moſt in their damnation; but onely upon the foreſight of originall ſinne, for which leaſt of all they are damned, and which doth leaſt of all juſtifie God in their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>But I come to the particular ſcanning of the parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You utterly miſtake my wordes; I ſaid not, the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> was the onely way, or any way, for the ſalvation of Infants: But this I ſaid, and ſay; the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> was the onely way of manifeſtation of Gods mercy in the ſalvation of Infants: For mercy ſuppoſeth miſery, and the miſery of Infants is onely in reſpect of ſinne origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, not at all in reſpect of ſinnes actuall, wherein they are nothing culpable. Now to the manifeſtation of Gods mercy in their ſalvation, the permiſſion of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and their fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> was a <hi>Medium:</hi> and I prove it thus, if God did permit <hi>Adam</hi> to ſinne, and theſe Infants in <hi>Adam,</hi> to this end, namely to the manifeſtation of his mercy in their ſalvation; then this permiſſion of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and their fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> was a <hi>Medium</hi> tending to the manifeſtation of his mercy in their ſalvation: But God did permit <hi>Adam</hi> to fall, and theſe Infants in <hi>Adam,</hi> to this very end. <hi>Ergo.</hi> I prove the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>r</hi> thus; he did permit <hi>Adam</hi> to fall, and theſe Infants in <hi>Adam,</hi> to the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his own glory in them: But no glory of God is more conveniently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the permiſſion of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and theſe Infants in <hi>Adam,</hi> than the glory of his mercy in the pardoning of their ſinnes, and ſaving their ſoules in deſpight of ſinne: Therefore this is to be accounted the end as much as any.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I nothing doubt, but that infants are ſaved <hi>ſine mediis;</hi> I ſpake not of the <hi>Media</hi> of their ſalvation, but of the manifeſtation of Gods mercy in their ſalvation: I make no queſtion, but that they are ſaved, by the merits of Chriſt, whether they have the ordinary meanes of applying Chriſt unto them, or no.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Touching reprobate Infants, I prove the permiſſion of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and their fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> was a <hi>Medium,</hi> tending to the manifeſtation or Gods juſtice in their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For if God did permit <hi>Adam</hi> to fall, and them in <hi>Adam,</hi> to this end, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the manifeſtation of his juſtice in their damnation, then this permiſſion was a <hi>Medium</hi> tending thereto. But to this end God did permit <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and their fall in <hi>Adam:</hi> which I prove thus; He did permit it for the manifeſtation of his own glory, as to this end he doth all things. But no glory of God is ſo conveniently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted hereby, as the glory of his juſtice in their damnation; unleſſe you will ſay with <hi>Alphonſus Mendoza,</hi> and <hi>Didscus Alvarez,</hi> that rather the manifeſtation of Gods glorious grace towards his elect, in conſideration that he could have made them veſſells of wrath as well as others, is the cauſe, why God doth not ſave all, but permits a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to ſinne, after much different courſes, and damnes them for ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Since their originall ſinne (you ſay) they are juſtly damnable; But I pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how came they to be thus juſtly damnable? was it onely by the will of <hi>Adam?</hi>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:56120:263"/>
was it not by the will of God alſo? That the firſt ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> alone, and no other, is imputed to his poſterity; how could this come to paſſe but by the will of God. 2. That the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> becomes fatall to all his poſterity, and not ſo the ſinne of any man elſe, to his poſterity, how is this, but by the will of God? 3. Could not God have derived a child from <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of his innocency, if he had ſo thought good? 4. How come we to be borne in originall ſinne, but by the will of God, who could have deſtroyed <hi>Adam</hi> after his ſinne, and made another Author of generation of mankind. In all this, appeares the will of God, and forceth us to acknowledge the power of God over his creatures, to diſpoſe of them as he thinkes good. But along to the reſt.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Although we ſay, the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> was conſidered in the decree of Gods electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <note place="margin">H.</note> yet we doe not ſay, it was preintended; (neither indeed can God properly be ſaid to intend any thing which he permits onely;) wherefore it followeth not, upon our opinion, that the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> was the end of mans ſalvation, and damnation, or that it was to be in execution after it: For the reſpect of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Finis</hi> is, where things are intended onely. But you will ſay, God intended the permiſſion of the fall, though not the fall it ſelfe, and if that were firſt in his intention, the ſame conſequents follow. I anſwer, it was one thing to conſider <hi>Adams</hi> fall as a thing that would be, if it were not hindered, another thing to reſolve poſitively to permit it. And though perhaps God did both, yet we make the former act onely, to have beene precedent to his election, not the latter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. I ſpake nothing of Gods intention that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould fall, but onely of Gods intention to permit him to fall; and ſhewed, that if the permiſſion of <hi>Adams</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">T.</note> fall, was firſt in intention, and then mans damnation, it will manifeſtly follow, that in execution it ſhall be laſt; that is, God ſhall firſt damne men for ſinne, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards permit <hi>Adam</hi> to fall into ſinne, and all in <hi>Adam.</hi> To this you ſay, that it is one thing to conſider <hi>Adams</hi> fall as a thing that would be, if it were not hindered; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to reſolve poſitively to permit it. But this anſwer is to no purpoſe. For my argument doth not depend upon the confuſion of theſe things, which you ſay doe differ, and therein ſay truly my argument depends upon a principle, that is <hi>totâ A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demia notiſſimum,</hi> and juſtified alſo by all experience, that what is firſt in intention is laſt in execution.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But what ſay you? doe you not make the permiſſion of <hi>Adams</hi> fall precedent to election and reprobation? why then let us ſhake hands; for the caſe is cleare, that then the foreſight of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, neither could be precedent to election: For the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of <hi>Adams</hi> fall in no moment of time before Gods reſolution to permit it: For though God foreſaw that <hi>Adam</hi> would fall, if God permitted him, yet could he not foreſee, that he would fall abſolutely, untill God were reſolved to permit him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some things you touch by the way, I may not omit, you ſay nothing can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to be intended, which he permits onely. This is very worthy of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, what think you of <hi>Adams</hi> eating of the forbidden fruit? did God intend that or no? Perhaps you will ſay, that God may be ſaid to intend that, becauſe he did only permit that as evill, but concurred to the effecting of it, as a naturall action. But then conſider, how was it poſſible, that God ſhould intend that this act ſhould come to paſſe and not the evill of it, whereas the evill, conſidering Gods interdict, was inſeparable from it. I ſhould anſwer it thus; As touching the ſubſtance of the act, God intended it ſhould come to paſſe, and it came to paſſe by Gods effection; for ſo God intended it ſhould come to paſſe, to wit, by his effection: But as touching the evill of the action God intended it ſhould come to paſſe, and it came to paſſe, but onely by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: for ſo onely he intended it ſhould come to paſſe, to wit, by his permiſſion.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon you may flye out, and deny that God did intend ſo much as the act it ſelfe of eating the forbidden fruit.</p>
                  <p>But I pray why might not God intend and determine, that that act ſhould come to paſſe, aſwell as the Jewes crucifying of Chriſt? yet what ſay the Apoſtles with one mouth, both <hi>Herod,</hi> &amp;c. why not aſwell as the Kings giving their Kingdomes unto the beaſt? yet it is expreſſely ſaid, that God put it into their hearts to doe his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ill even in this, to wit, giving their Kingdomes unto the beaſt.</p>
                  <p>In a word, I have a Digreſſion to this purpoſe, in the ſecond booke, <hi>Digreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

11. In your laying downe the order of Gods decrees, I would gladly underſtand <note place="margin">H.</note> one thing. Whether you make his firſt decree <hi>de fine,</hi> to have been definite or indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite? I meane, whether he reſolved at firſt, to declare his mercy upon ſuch and ſuch perſons as <hi>Peter, Judas,</hi> &amp;c. or indefinitely upon ſome onely? If you make it indefinite, it may be, ſuch a decree might paſſe upon <hi>Maſſa nondum condita.</hi> But that is not the decree of election. If you make it definite, me thinkes your arguments before allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged are ſtrong—againſt it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> Your diſtinction is good of a decree definite and indefinite; in the ſame tearms you ſhall finde it diſputed of, in the third Digreſſion of thoſe that are come to your <note place="margin">T.</note> hands: and ſound labouring to hold up a decree indefinite, but all in vaine. The truth is <hi>Maſſa nondum condita</hi> is not to be taken poſitively, but privately rather as it denies creation and corruption precedent to Gods predeſtination, foraſmuch as all theſe decrees of creation, of permiſſion of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, of liberation finall from ſins by faith and repentance, and laſtly of ſalvation, are but one formall complete decree <hi>de mediis,</hi> tending to one compleate end, which is the manifeſtation of Gods glory in the way of mercy mixt with juſtice: On the other ſide, all theſe decrees, to wit, of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of permiſſion of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, of finall dereliction in ſin, and laſtly of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſin, doe make up but one compleat decree <hi>de medijs,</hi> tending to one end, which is the manifeſtation of Gods glory in the way of juſtice. As for the ſtrength of your arguments, alleadged againſt this opinion, I remit to every indifferent mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to conſider thereof.</p>
                  <p>As touching the firſt arguments you propoſe, I could gratifie you thus farre, that the decrees you ſpeake of, doe conſuppoſe ſin, but not preſuppoſe ſinne. Foraſmuch as my Tenet is, that in the ſame moment with thoſe decrees, God doth conſider their ſin, but not in any moment before it. This I ſay my Tenet alloweth me to grant, but I cannot acknowledge that any of your arguments prove thus much.</p>
                  <p>But then againe, I maintaine that theſe decrees conſuppoſe other ſinnes, aſwell as originall; yea the decree of damnation conſuppoſeth in the ſame moment all their actuall ſins, yea even finall impenitency; foraſmuch as God decreeth to damne no man of ripe yeares, but for all the ſins that ever he ſhall commit, and finall impenitency in them: whereas you maintaine that God firſt decrees to damne them, and then fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeth the actuall ſins of theirs, for which they ſhall be damned.</p>

                     <p>IT is indeed the judgement of ſome Learned men, that the purpoſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of God to permit, or ſuffer ſuch, or ſuch a thing to be done, or ſuch <note place="margin">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Twiſſe.</note> or ſuch an accident to come to paſſe, ſuppoſeth a neceſſity (at least a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisticall or conſequentiall neceſſity) of the coming of it to paſſe. But that the truth lieth on the other ſide of the way, appears by the light of this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. If whatſoever God hath decreed, or intendeth, to permit to come to paſſe in any caſe, upon any termes, or any ſuppoſition whatſoever, ſhould by vertue of ſuch an intention or decree, neceſſarily come to paſſe, then all things poſſible to be, (or at least ten thouſand things more than ever ſhall be) must be, yea, and this neceſſarily. For (doubtleſſe God hath decreed, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to leave naturall cauſes, generally, to their naturall and proper operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and productions; yea and voluntary cauſes alſo, under a power, and at liberty to act ten thouſand things more, then ever they will doe, or ſhall doe. For example; God intendeth, and hath decreed, to permit, that fire ſhall burne, what combustible matter ſoever it ſhall take hold of, or that ſhall be cast into it, that one ſparke of it falling into a barrell of dried Gunpowder, ſhould ſuddainly fire it, &amp;c. But it doth not follow from hence, that therefore every thing that is combustible in the world, ſhall be burnt with fire; or that every barrell of dry Gun-powder ſhall be blown up with ſparkes of fire falling into them. So (in the instance formerly mentioned) God had decreed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>the Lords of Keilah</hi> to deliver up <hi>David</hi> into <hi>Sauls</hi> hand, in caſe he had stayed in their Citty, till <hi>Sauls</hi> coming to demand him: this is evident from <note place="margin">1 Sam. 23. 12.</note> the Text. But it did not follow from this permiſſive decree of God, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe <hi>Lords</hi> must neceſſarily deliuer up <hi>David</hi> into <hi>Sauls</hi> hand: for we know they did it not. So likewiſe, God hath decreed to permit any man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the life of another whom he meets with (I meane, in reſpect of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power to doe the execution) but it followeth not from hence, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every man muſt neceſſarily murther, or deſtroy the life of his Brother, that cometh in his way. So that evident it is, that no decree of God whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, which is ſimply and purely permiſsive, doth import any neceſsity at all of the perpetration, or coming to paſſe, of the thing ſo decreed. God permitted <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>eate of every tree in the garden of Eden (the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 16, 17</note> of good and evill only excepted)</hi> &amp; therefore certainly had decreed, or intended this permiſſion: yet was not <hi>Adam</hi> any waies neceſsitated by any vertue or influence of this decree upon him, to <hi>eate of every</hi> of theſe <hi>trees;</hi> nor is it in the leaſt degree credible, that ever he did <hi>eate of every</hi> of them, nor yet of any one of them, but only that, which was prohibited unto him, his ejection out of this garden following ſo ſuddainly after this patent, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion granted unto him. The reaſon why no decree of God, that is purely and barely permiſſive, either induceth or ſuppoſeth any neceſsity of the coming to paſſe, of what is only ſo decreed, is this. Firſt, becauſe no ſuch decree doth any waies intereſſe God to any manner of interpoſall, either by his wiſdome, power, or providence in what kind ſoever, towards the effecting or bringing to paſse of what is ſo decreed. So that ſuch events, which are no otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56120:266"/>
by God, then thus, are in the ſame poſture of contingency, in the ſame poſsibility of being, or not being, wherein they would have been, had there been no ſuch decree at all concerning them. Secondly, neither doth any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree in God, ſuppoſe a futurity of ſuch a concurrence of cauſes ſimply requiſite and neceſſary for the bringing of things, ſo decreed, to paſſe, which will actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bring them to paſſe. Though God hath decreed, that a ſparke, or coale of fire falling, <hi>i. e.</hi> in caſe it ſhall fall into a barrell of Gun-powder, ſhall fire it, yet it doth not follow from hence, that he hath decreed, that any ſuch ſparke or coale, ſhall fall into it, without which notwithſtanding the effect decreed, <hi>viz.</hi> the firing of this powder, will not come to paſſe. Or if he ſaid, that God hath decreed that ſuch a ſparke, or coale, ſhall fall into the ſaid barrell of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, now is not the decree barely permiſsive, but operative and aſſertive, and ſuch which engageth the decreer to interpoſe effectually for the bringing of the thing decreed to paſſe. But ſuch decrees as this, in matters of that nature we deny to be in God.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, from naturall actions he proceedes on to <hi>morall,</hi> and he begineth with good and gracious actions; in which he reſolveth that naturall permisſion, <hi>hoc est, non in genere morali ſed Phyſico,</hi> can have no place, for (ſaith he) this would ſuppoſe, that the creature can be carryed unto actions truly good, without any ſpeciall ſupply or asſiſtance of Gods ſpirit and grace, which we deny can be in the ſtate of nature entire and pure, how much leſſe is it posſible in the ſtate of nature corrupted: whence alſo (ſaith he) it would follow, that God doth not antecedently worke and cauſe every act truly good, and that by a ſpeciall ſupply, aid, or asſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>As for Gods permisſion of good actions in <hi>genere morali,</hi> he referreth to what he hath ſpoken touching the like permisſion of naturall actions, only he addeth, that God allwayes concurreth unto an act truly good by a ſpeciall asſiſtance &amp; that both as a Phyſicall and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall agent: wherefore (ſaith he) in this gracious adminiſtration of things there is no place at all for permisſion, as it is oppoſed unto <hi>effection</hi> or farthering; for God worketh, cauſeth, and promoteth every good worke in his children; although permisſion may have roome there, as it ſimply ſignifieth <hi>non-hindrance,</hi> for queſtionleſſe God doth not hinder
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56120:267"/>
the good workes of his people, which he himſelfe cauſeth and worketh. Thus you ſee, that by D. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> his opinion, good workes doe not follow upon Gods bare, ſingle, and ſole permisſion, for they cannot be performed without the powerfull operation of Gods holy ſpirit, which worketh in us both the will and the deed.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, as touching evill or ſinfull actions, in them divine permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on challengeth a proper and peculiar place, both as permiſſion is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto <hi>efficiency,</hi> as alſo unto <hi>reſtraint.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, as 'tis oppoſed unto <hi>efficiency,</hi> for the obliquity of them being a privation, is not capable of an efficient cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as 'tis oppoſed unto <hi>restraint,</hi> for God doth not hinder ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full actions many times, though it be alwaies in his power.</p>
                     <p>But now if we ſpeake of the permiſsion of ſinfull actions, in <hi>genere morali,</hi> or <hi>ſuaſorio;</hi> ſo all unanimouſly affirme, that God perſwadeth or exhorteth none unto evill: for if God ſhould interpoſe his authority, by commanding, adviſing, or exhorting, whatſoever ſhould be done hereupon, would be lawfully done.</p>
                     <p>But though God himſelfe doth not exhort or perſwade unto ſinne, yet he gives way many times, and that juſtly, unto the temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and his inſtruments; nay, he himſelfe by his providence, layes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men outward objects and occaſions, ſuitable unto their inward corruptions; as a goodly Babyloniſh garment, two hundred ſheckles of ſilver, and a wedge of Gold of fifty ſheckles weight, before the covetous eyes of <hi>Achan:</hi> beautifull and naked <hi>Bathſheba</hi> before the luſtfull eyes of <hi>David.</hi> Next he ſuffereth thoſe corruptions, that is, either he doth not cure them by his renewing grace, or he doth not bridle them by his reſtraining grace, but lets them have their full ſwinge, without check or controll: In his children he doth not actuate and rouze their graces, but lets them lye as it were in a deep ſleepe, &amp;c. Beſides, he concurreth unto thoſe motions of the ſoule, (as touching the entity of them) unto which men are ſtirred, by view of objects, that are agreeable unto ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their unſubdued or unbridled luſts. From the complication of all theſe, a particular obduration, and ſinfull action followeth, ſo that you take in alſo, the concourſe of God, ſo farre as concernes the ſubſtance, or matter of ſuch a ſinfull action. Now from this variety of providences going before a ſinfull action, D. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> drawes this following concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Ex quib us manifestum videtur, ex ſolâ permiſſione nequaquam conſequi, quod fiat aliquid; &amp; proinde etiam minus verum videtur illud Perkinſei, Quicquid Deus non impedit; ideo fit, quia Deus non impedit.</hi> From which it ſeems manifeſt, that it in no waies followeth, that a thing cometh to paſſe upon Gods ſole permiſsion, and therefore that of <hi>Perkins</hi> ſeemes not to be true, whatſoever God doth not hinder therefore cometh to paſſe, becauſe God doth not hinder it.</p>
                     <p>In the next place he bringeth in, and anſwereth objections.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, This is the opinion not only of <hi>Perkins</hi> but of <hi>Piſcator</hi> alſo.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, our adverſaries (by name <hi>Vorſtius</hi> and <hi>Arminius)</hi> grant it, and their conceſsion ſhould be embraced, as making much for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our opinion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, there is a reaſon, which at the firſt bluſh ſeems convincing, unto which not only <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> but alſo <hi>Piſcator</hi> yeeldeth, and 'tis drawn from the nature of Relatives: For, ſeeing permiſsion and the thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted are Relatives, it ſeems neceſſary, that they exiſt together: upon ſuppoſall then of the permiſsion of the coming to paſſe of ſuch a thing
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56120:268"/>
it ſeems neceſſary, that that which is ſo permitted, doe come to paſſe. Unto theſe he diſpatcheth an anſwer ſeverally, in the ſame order as they were propounded.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, as for our Divines, he acknowledgeth, that they have ſo thought, but truth is to be preferred before any teſtimony; <hi>Amicus Socrates, Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Plato, magis amica veritas:</hi> For 'tis but reaſon that we ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard unto, and care of, only truth, that ſo we may (with the Apoſtle) ſay, we can doe nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he ſheweth, how that for the exiſtence of a thing, <hi>Piſcator</hi> doth not acquieſce in Gods ſole permiſsion, but flyeth unto Gods go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that ſo powerfull, as that it bowes, bends, and turnes the <note place="margin">Veruntamen &amp; hoc etiam advertendum eſt; cum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra <hi>Piſcatorem</hi> in hunc modum diſputaret <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> Permiſſio in eo, cui permiſſio fit, nihil omnino novl per ſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſat aut efficit, ſed tantum vires &amp; facultates ſemel illi datas, ab alienâ laeſione tutas praeſtat, &amp; liberum iſtarum exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citium eidem relinquit: imo nihil prorſus extra ipſum permittentem efficit, niſi quod actionem hujus impedientem cohibet, aut potius retinet, &amp; quaſi ſuſpendit.

                     <p>As for the reaſon, that is of no force or ſtrength, for we may as well conclude, that becauſe God did from eternall will or decree to create the World, therefore the World from eternall was created; or becauſe God from eternall foreknew that the World ſhould be, therefore the World did exiſt from eternall: for there is no leſſe relation, between the willing of a thing, and the thing willed; the decree of a thing, and the thing decreed; the foreknowledge of a thing, and the thing fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne; than there is, between the permiſſion of a thing, and the thing permitted. And there is between them as a relation, ſo alſo a reciproca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whereupon it followeth, that if God willeth or decreeth a thing, it is willed or decreed; if he foreknowes a thing, it is foreknown; if he permits a thing it is permitted: but as it doth not follow, a thing is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or decreed, therefore 'tis actually exiſtent; a thing is foreknown, therefore it is; In like manner it doth not follow, a thing is permitted, therefore it is actually: and indeed if Gods meere permiſſion did inferre the exiſtence of a thing upon this ground, becauſe permiſſion and the thing permitted are relatives, it would hold as well concerning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of man, as God; But 'tis manifeſt, that it followeth not upon mans permiſsion, that whatſoever he permitteth, cometh to paſſe.</p>
                     <p>But it may be objected, it is neceſſary that whatſoever is willed by God, doe at ſome time or other, come to paſſe, therefore we may ſay the ſame of what is permitted by God.</p>
                     <p>He denyeth the conſequence, and he giveth this reaſon for his denyall, becauſe Gods permiſsion is not ſo effectuall unto the exiſtence of a thing,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56120:268"/>
as his volition; and yet he acknowledgeth, that this kind of conſequence is true in naturall cauſes, but this is not in regard only of permiſſion, but from the determination of a naturall cauſe to worke, unleſſe it be hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: as concerning rationall and free agents, this conſequence, a thing is permitted to come to paſſe, therefore it doth come to paſſe, is of no <note place="margin">Ad rationem vero quod attinet, eam nullius eſſe pretii conſtanter affirmamus.

                     <p>The laſt and principall objection is concerning the permisſion of ſinne in particular; without grace ſinne cannot be avoyded, and the permisſion of ſinne ſtands in the denyall of grace: it is cleare therefore that upon the permisſion of ſinne, ſinne neceſſarily enſueth.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, he anſwereth, this in no-wiſe followeth from the nature of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion in generall (as ſome Divines, have thought) but from a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar manner of Gods permiſsion, ſtanding in a conſtant denyall of grace without which ſinne can be ſhunned by none.</p>
                     <p>Secondly he diſtinguiſheth of a twofold conſideration of ſinne, <hi>indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> or <hi>definite,</hi> and that either in regard of ſorts and kinds, or elſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular actions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, he grants, that upon the permiſsion of ſinne, that is, the denyall of grace, ſinne followeth <hi>indefinitely,</hi> and in generall; ſo that as long as God with-holds his grace, a man ſinnes, either in doing what is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or elſe in doing what is commanded in a wrong way or manner. He alſo ſinnes in omitting what is commanded, or in abſtaining from what is forbidden in an unholy, and ungratious way or manner. And this he exemplifieth both in the unregenerate and regenerate.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, whiles God denies to, or withholds from, an unregenerate man, his habituall grace, or grace of regeneration; whileſt he ſuffereth his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall diſeaſes to goe uncured, his corruptions unſubdued, and unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, ſo long he cannot but ſinne in all his <hi>rationall and deliberate,</hi> both actions and omiſsions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="208" facs="tcp:56120:269"/>
Firſt, all his actions are ſinnes of commiſſion, either a doing of what is forbidden, or a ſinfull performance of what is commanded, not out of right principles, nor for the due and requiſite end.</p>
                     <p>Secondly all his omiſſions are ſinfull, for they are either of what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, or elſe if they be of what is prohibited, they are not ſanctified, proceeding from the love of God, and directed unto the glory of God above all.</p>
                     <p>Next as for the regenerate, if God deny unto, or withhold from them, never ſo little a while, his actuall grace, the actuall ſupply, and aſſiſtance of his ſpirit, they ſinne in whatſoever they performe, or forbeare; And indeed it is no wonder, that upon Gods ſuſpending the aide of his actuall grace, the regenerate breake out into ſinne, in whom there is a fleſh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies luſting againſt the ſpirit, whoſe graces are imperfect, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions naturall, and therefore active, upon removall of impediments; For ſinne in <hi>Adam</hi> followed upon the ſole ſuſpenſion of actuall aſſiſtance to will that good, unto which he had an habituall fitneſſe; and yet in him propenſion unto good was perfect, without any mixture of inclination unto evill.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he denyeth, that upon the bare permiſſion of ſinne, ſinne followeth <hi>definitely,</hi> either for ſorts and kinds, or particular actions. But here firſt, he implyeth an exception of <hi>generall,</hi> and <hi>comprehenſive</hi> ſinnes, that either lye at the root of, or are concomitant unto every ſinne, as inordinate ſelfe-love &amp;c. <hi>Fortè dici potest, ex carentià justitiae originalis, ſequi neceſſario, ut creatura feratur in amorem ſui inordinatè, adeo ut quicquid operatur, illud faciat propter ſe, non autem propter Deum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly he deſireth, chiefly to be underſtood concerning the <hi>imperate</hi> or <hi>externall actions</hi> of ſin, and ſuch actions of the will, as are of <hi>efficacy,</hi> purpoſes, reſolutions, &amp;c. For upon Gods permiſſion, that is, not curing, or healing, not ſubduing of particular ſinfull habits. <hi>v. g.</hi> Covetouſneſſe, luxury, there doe neceſſarily follow ſuch ſinfull actions of the will, as are ſtiled uſually to be of <hi>complacency,</hi> that doe, <hi>quoad ſpecificationem,</hi> for their ſort and kind, anſwer ſuch habits, to wit, velleities, deſires, woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and wiſhings, likeings, approbations, &amp;c. A covetous man whileſt under the reigne of covetouſneſſe, cannot but love, like, and covet after things which he judgeth to be gainfull; a luxurious voluptuary cannot but love, approve, and long after things which he knoweth to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightfull unto his ſenſes. <hi>Omnino videtur Deum non poſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedire, ne avarus velit &amp; concupiſcat ea, quae videntur utilia; vel libidinoſus ea, quae titillant tanquam jucunda: nam velle &amp; concupiſcere, nihil aliud eſt, quam deſiderare; at avarus quà avarus neceſſario talia deſiderat &amp; concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, aliàs non eſſet avarus, &amp; libidinoſus quà libidinoſus talia deſiderat, aliâs minime dicendus eſſet libidinoſus. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>part.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 15. For habits work <hi>ad modum naturae</hi> neceſſarily. A covetous perſon, as covetous, neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſireth and coveteth things profitable; a luſtfull or uncleane perſon neceſſarily deſireth ſuch objects and actions as are uncleane, &amp;c. And yet of theſe too, we cannot ſay that they follow meerely upon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſecluding his concourſe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe limitations premiſed; let us returne to conſider what he deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to wit, that upon the bare permiſſion of ſinne, ſinne doth not follow <hi>definitely</hi> for ſorts or kinds, or particular actions. <hi>Sine gratiâ</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>abstineri potest a peccato definite quo ad certam ſpeciem, vel etiam in indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duo conſideratam.</hi> There is no particular ſinne, eſpecially of commiſsion, but may be abſtained from without grace: And therefore upon the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56120:269"/>
meere and bare denyall or with-holding of grace, this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſinne doth not follow.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, thoſe that are deſtitute of habituall grace, the grace of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, may yet be free from diverſe particular ſinfull habits. <hi>v. g.</hi> Covetouſneſſe, Luxury, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in thoſe that have ſuch particular ſinfull habits; thoſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits are not actuated, eſpecially by outward actions, upon Gods <hi>bare</hi> and <hi>ſingle permiſſion,</hi> his ſole denyall of grace. This he proves by reaſon and Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Firſt by reaſon, becauſe the ſubject of an actuall ſinne of commiſsion, is a <hi>naturall act,</hi> and unto the performance of a naturall act, Gods bare permiſſion is not ſufficient, <hi>Malum (quod dicitur) ſemper habitat in alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no fundo; &amp; peccatum omne quod in commiſſione verſatur, ſemper habet actum aliquém naturalem ſubstratum; adeo ut ejuſmodi peccatum aliquod nunquam exeat in actum ex ſolâ negatione gratiae, niſi etiam aliqua alia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum adminiſtratio ſiat, ſecundum quam actus aliquis naturalis patretur, quae ſit propria materia ta lis deformitatis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly by Scripture, in which Gods wonderfull providence work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and proſtituting men unto ſinne, is never ſet forth unto us, by a <hi>ſole</hi> and <hi>ſingle permiſsion:</hi> But he is ſaid, ſometimes to <hi>give men up unto vile affections, unto a reprobate mind, unto ſtrong deluſions, to ſend an evill ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit between men, to put a lying ſpirit in their mouthes, to mingle a perverſe ſpirit in them, &amp;c. He told David, that he would take away his concubines, and give them unto his Sonne Abſolon; He told Jeroboam, that he would rent the Kingdome out of the hands of Solomon, and give ten tribes unto Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> which was done by their defection, and revolt from the houſe of Judah. Now they who think that all theſe things might be diſpatched, and accompliſhed by Gods <hi>ſole</hi> and <hi>ſingle permiſsion,</hi> take I confeſſe (ſaith he) a ſhort cut, but they ſend away the Reader, that is deſirous to find out the truth, empty and voyd of all ſatisfaction. Upon this he concludes, that as often as any thing comes to paſſe according to Gods permiſſion, ſo often Gods permiſſion is not ſolitary or ſingle, but hath another government of things, another adminiſtration of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, accompanying it; which he explaineth at large touching ſinne: unto the performance of this or that particular ſinfull action, there are required a leading into temptation, an affording of objects, occaſions, and opportunities, a letting looſe of Satan, the concourſe of God by way of previous motion unto the matter, or ſubject of the action, a removeall of all impediments, whether holy and gratious, or elſe but meerely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall. The explanation of all which, you may there ſee at large in this digreſsion.</p>
                     <p>Out of this he inferreth a diſtinction of permiſsion, into <hi>efficacious</hi> and <hi>unefficacious,</hi> and concludes that the permiſsion of ſinne is not ſo much <hi>efficacious</hi> of it ſelfe, as in regard of that either obduration, or exceca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or both, concerning either temporall, or ſpirituall good things, with which it is conioyned. <hi>Hinc constare poterit permiſsionem peccati particularis commodè dividendam eſſe, in permiſsionem efficacem &amp; ineffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacem, &amp; permiſsionem efficacem non tam ex ſeſe efficacem eſſe, quam pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ratione ejus, cum quâ ſemper conjuncta eſt, obdurationis, excaecationis, aut utriuſ<expan>

                     </p>
                     <p>But I ſhall trouble neither the Reader, nor you, with tranſcribing any more out of this digreſſion. And indeed this is enough to ſatisfy him,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56120:270"/>
and convince you, that you have wronged D. <hi>Twiſse,</hi> in pinning upon him ſuch an opinion, which he oppoſeth with farre greater ſtrength of argument, then you your ſelfe. This is ſufficient to anſwer this whole ſection; But I ſhall examine whatſoever is conſiderable in it.</p>
                     <p>The propoſition you charge upon D. <hi>Twiſse</hi> is this, <hi>That the purpoſe or intent of God, to permit, or ſuffer ſuch or ſuch a thing to be done, or ſuch or ſuch an accident to come to paſse, ſuppoſeth a neceſſity (at least a ſyllogisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or conſequentiall neceſſity) of the coming of it to paſse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He that is acquainted with the workes of D. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> knoweth, that this propoſition is to be underſtood. 1. Concerning only the permiſſion of evill. 2. Concerning not only Gods act, the permiſſion of evill, but alſo the being of evill by Gods permiſſion. 3. Concerning not a ſingle, ſole, and bare permiſſion, but an efficacious permiſſion, that hath ſeverall acts of Gods providence accompanying it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it is to be underſtood only concerning the <hi>permiſſion of evill,</hi> and that as touching the <hi>Formall,</hi> the pravity or obliquity of it, which being a privation is uncapable of being an object of an effective decree. This I might cleare from moſt of thoſe places, wherein this diſtinction between an <hi>effective</hi> and <hi>permiſſive decree</hi> is propounded; but I ſhall ſpare to name them at this preſent, and content my ſelfe, with the alleadging of one place, where he expreſſely puts this limitation upon the propoſition we ſpeake of, <hi>De Scientiâ Mediâ. pag.</hi> 133. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>Non pauci ſunt, non modo ex nostris, ſed &amp; ex Theologis nobis oppoſitis, tam Pontificiis, quam Arminianis, qui putant, infallibitèr futurum eſſe, quicquid &amp;c.

that ever dropt from the pen of a rationall man, and in D. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> there is nothing ſounding like it: you doe very ill therefore (that I ſay no more) to aſperſe him with it.

                     <p>And that your ſatisfaction unto this, may be the fuller and diſtincter, I ſhall branch it into ſome particulars, which I ſhall entreat you to cleare up unto me.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, there are many things that are meerely poſsible, numberleſſe millions of men and Angells, which have not, never had, never ſhall have actuall exiſtence: and unto theſe there is poſsible, as great a variety of both actions and ſufferings, which that God hath decreed to permit to come to paſſe conditionally, in ſome caſe, upon ſome termes, upon ſome ſuppoſition or other, is not (I confeſſe) within the compaſſe of my Creed; but yet I ſhall be willing to be inſtructed by you, provided that you prove what you undertake to teach me.</p>

And he inſinuates this reaſon out of <hi>Ledeſma,</hi> becauſe other conditionall decrees would be in vaine, impertinent, and no waies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing unto Gods providence, and government of the World: which reaſon is as well applyable unto conditionall permiſsive, as conditionall effective decrees.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>Rutherford</hi> (I know) argueth ſomewhat againſt this, but I believe you will not plow with his Heifer.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that D. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> not only affirmeth but proveth, that things meerely poſsible, are not the object of Gods decree, in his Book againſt <hi>Iackſon</hi> p. 283. 333. &amp; 394. <hi>Looke we</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>upon the decrees of men, the wiſest of men, were they ever known to decree that a thing may be done? But rather ſuppoſing many things may be done, they make choyce to decree the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch courſes, as ſeeme most convenient: things are poſſible without any reference to the decrees of God, but only in reference to his power. That is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible unto God, which he can doe, or which he hath power to cauſe, that it be brought to paſſe; As for example, before the World was made, it was poſsible that the World ſhould be made; was this by vertue of Gods decree? Did God decree it to be poſſible? If he did, ſeeing his decrees are free, it followeth that he might have choſen whether the World ſhould have been poſſible or no.</hi> His arguments are applyable unto Gods permiſsive as well as effective decrees, unto his conditionall, as well as abſolute decrees.

                     <p>Againe of thoſe things which are poſsible unto all ſorts and kinds of agents, there are ſome which God hath abſolutely decreed to <hi>effect,</hi> or bring to paſſe by his <hi>operation,</hi> ſome which he hath abſolutely decreed to <hi>hinder or reſtraine.</hi> Now whatſoever God worketh or effecteth, he doth not permit, as permiſſion is oppoſed unto <hi>effection,</hi> and therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the object of a bare permiſsive decree, but of an operative or effective. Secondly, what he hindereth or reſtraineth either <hi>immediately</hi> by himſelfe, or <hi>mediately</hi> by ſecond cauſes, he cannot be at all ſaid to permit, and therefore he never decreed to permit it; more briefely, God cannot be ſaid to decree the bare and naked permiſsion of that whoſe effection or working he hath decreed; he cannot be ſaid to decree the permiſsion of that, whoſe hinderance or reſtraint he hath intended, but of things poſsible, he hath decreed the effection of ſome, the reſtraint and hinderance of others: and therefore there are many things poſſible, which he hath not decreed barely to permit.</p>
                     <p>I but perhaps you will ſay, that though whatſoever God hath abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely decreed to effect or hinder, he hath not decreed to permit to come to paſſe abſolutely, yet he hath decreed it ſhall come to paſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, <hi>in ſuch caſes, upon ſuch termes, and upon ſuch a ſuppoſition.</hi> But this is ſpoken <hi>gratis,</hi> and therefore I doe beſeech you to evidence it by dint of argument, unto which if convincing, I hope I ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>

                     <p>SO likewiſe God hath decreed, to permit any man to deſtroy the life of another whom he meets with (I meane in reſpect of a naturall power, to doe the execution) but it followeth not from hence, that therefore every man muſt neceſſarily murder or deſtroy the life of his brother that cometh in his way.</p>

                     <head>IEANES.</head>
                     <p>UNto this I oppoſe theſe following arguments. Firſt, God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds many bloody minded men from actuall murder, as well as he did <hi>Abimelech</hi> from committing adultery, and unto him cannot be permitted the doing of a thing, who is reſtrayned therefrom; for permiſſion and reſtraint are oppoſed <hi>privatively,</hi> and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be found in the ſame ſubject at once, in regard of the ſame action.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, permiſsion of the ſin of murder eſſentially implyeth, a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of grace effectuall and neceſſary, for the avoydance of the ſinne of murder: but God doth not withhold from every man that grace, which is effectuall and neceſſary for avoydance of the ſinne of murder; And therefore he doth not permit every man to commit it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, permiſsion of outward and imperate acts (aſwell as reſtraint, unto which it is privatively oppoſed) ſuppoſeth a propenſion or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto them, a purpoſe or deſire of them in the agents unto whom they are permitted: but there is not in every man a propenſion or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, a purpoſe or deſire to murder every one that commeth in his way; Therfore God doth not permit every ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to murther every one that cometh in his way. The Major is a principle with <hi>Arminius</hi> in his <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate de permiſſione; in perſonâ cui permittitur, duo ponenda, actus istius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectu, Primo, vires ſufficientes ad actum praestandum, intellige, niſi impedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur: Secundo, propenſio ad actum producendum, citra hanc enim fruſtrà permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur actus, citra illas omnino non permittitur; nam neceſſario ad actus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtationem</hi>

                        <hi>requiruntur: utut adſint illae, niſi propendeat perſona, cui permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur actus, ad actum ipſum, nullo fine &amp; in vagum permittitur.

                     </p>
                     <p>Unto what <hi>Arminius</hi> and D. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> ſay, I ſhall adde this reaſon of mine own. Permiſsion and reſtraint are oppoſed privatively, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath taught us: l. Categ. Cap. 10. S. 11. <hi>Sunt circa idem, Nulli rei competit privatio, cui non poſſit etiam competere habitus:</hi> And therefore we call not any thing deafe, blind, or dumbe, but what is capable of hearing, ſight and ſpeech. In like manner no outward action can properly be permitted unto a man, but what he may be hindered and reſtrayned from: but now a man cannot be hindered, or reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the performance of an outward action, unto which he hath no propenſion or inclination, of which he hath no purpoſe or deſire, no more than he can be conſtrayned unto that, from which he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, therefore neither can ſuch an action be permitted unto him, if we take permiſsion <hi>properly,</hi> (as <hi>Bannes</hi> ſaith) as it is not <hi>nuda negatio, ſed privatio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this time the Reader, I ſuppoſe, is ſatisfied, that God doth not permit every man to murther or deſtroy the life of every one that cometh in his way; and therefore conſequently, he hath not decreed or intended any ſuch permiſſion. As for the limitation which you bring to qualify your aſſertion, it nothing mends the matter: for I have proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the aſſertion to be falſe in it ſelfe, by arguments, that feare not the light of your tryall or examination: and falſe aſſertions cannot be made good by any limitations whatſoever; ſo much I learned when I was a Boy from <hi>Keckerm. Syſtem. Log. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Quicquid ſubjecto limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tativè tribuitur, id verè tribuitur.</hi> But ſuppoſe this aſſertion were juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, by ſome limitation or other, yet not by this, which you bring; becauſe this naturall power to doe the execution, (as you ſpeake) is <hi>inſufficient</hi> to denominate the permiſſion of murther; becauſe 'tis <hi>conſistent</hi> with the oppoſite of ſuch a permiſſion, reſtraint from mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe 'tis <hi>inſufficient</hi> to denominate the permiſſion of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: A naturall power to performe an action is eſſentially requiſite unto the permiſſion thereof, but it is not only the eſſentiall requiſite thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and therefore an inſufficient ground for the affirmation of it. If it be lawfull to affirme a predicate of a ſubject in reſpect of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of one eſſentiall requiſite unto the ſaid predicate, when there are wanting any other things eſſentially required thereunto alſo, as abſurd propoſitions as are imagineable, will be hence juſtified: As that
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56120:274"/>
beaſts and plants are men, and Men beaſts; for of beaſts and plants there are affirmed diverſe things, which doe agree unto man eſſentially; and ſo on the other ſide, diverſe things are predicated of men eſſentially, which are alſo eſſentiall unto beaſts and plants.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a naturall power to deſtroy the life of another, is <hi>conſistent</hi> with the oppoſite of ſuch a permiſſion, to wit, reſtraint from the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of him: a power to produce an act may be hindered <hi>majoris aut ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualis ſaltem potentiae oppoſitione,</hi> ſaith your <hi>Arminius,</hi> by oppoſall of a greater, or at leaſt an equall power: though a man have not only a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but a will, a deſire, and purpoſe to take away the life of another, yet he may be reſtrained, not only by feare of puniſhment, dictates of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall conſcience within, but alſo by oppoſition of a greater or equall power without. Now permiſſion and reſtraint are privatively oppoſed, and therefore we cannot ſay, that an action is permitted in regard of that which is common unto both permiſsion and reſtraint, and may be found, as well when an action is reſtrained, as when it is permitted. If I ſhould ſay that a blind man ſees, in reſpect of the firſt naturall power of ſeeing; that a deafe man hears, in reſpect of the firſt naturall power of hearing; you would ſay that my limitation were abſurd and ridiculous: becauſe this naturall firſt power of ſeeing is found both in the blind and the ſeeing; and we may ſay the ſame of the firſt power of hearing. Yet this limitation is as juſtifiable as yours; for the naturall power you ſpeake of, to doe the execution, is found as well in the reſtraint, as in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of murther</p>

You have it in his examination of M.</hi> Cottons <hi>Treatiſe</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p. 68, 69. As alſo in his Conſideration of that Scoffing Pamphlet of</hi> Tilenus, viz. <hi>the Doctrine of the Synod of</hi> Dort <hi>and</hi> Arles <hi>reduced to the practiſe. p. 18, 19.</hi> Nay I ſay more, <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> that every thing, which cometh to paſſe, in the revolution of times, was decreed by God; which I proove by ſuch an argument, for anſwer whereunto, I challeng the whole nations of both Arminans and Ieſuites. It cannot be denied, but God foreſaw from everlasting, whatſoever in time ſhould come to paſſe, therefore every thing was future from everlasting, otherwiſe God could not foreſee it as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now let us ſoberly enquire, how theſe things which we call future, came to be future, being in their own nature meerely poſſible, and indifferent, as well not at all to be future, as to be future. Of this tranſmigration of things, out of the condition of things meerely poſsible (ſuch as they were of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) into the condition of things future, there must needs be ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cauſe. Now I demand, what was the cauſe of this tranſmigration? And ſeeing nothing, without the nature of God, could be the cauſe hereof (for this tranſmigration was from everlaſting, but nothing without God was everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting) therefore ſomething within the nature of God must be found fit to be the cauſe hereof.</p>
                     <p>And what may that be? Not the knowledge of God, for that rather preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth things future, and ſo knowable in the kind of things future, then makes them future: therefore it remaines, that the meere decree and will of God, is that which makes them future. If to ſhift off this, it be ſaid, that the eſſence of God is the cauſe hereof; I farther demand, whether the eſſence of God be the cauſe hereof, as working neceſſarily, or as working freely; If as working neceſſarily, then the most contingent things became future by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Divine nature, and conſequently he produceth whatſoever he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth by neceſſity of nature, which is Atheisticall: therefore it remaines, that the Eſſence of God hath made them future, by working freely, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the meere will and decree of God is the cauſe of the futurition of all things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He ſpeakes indeed of Gods will and decree indefinitely, but that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>under he comprehends an operative or effective decree, is undeniable.

In like manner if any either Proteſtants, or Papiſts, have denyed foreknowledge to be <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> in God, they are to be underſtood concerning ſuch a foreknowledge, as is found in men, in whom 'tis cloathed with many imperfections, from which 'tis abſtracted, as it is aſcribed unto God. But I ſhall take a more particular and diſtinct notice of theſe two termes <hi>Formally</hi> and <hi>Properly</hi> in reference unto the attribution of foreknowledge unto God.</p>
                     <p>And firſt let us enquire whether foreknowledge can formally be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto God.</p>
                     <p>The terme <hi>Formally</hi> may be oppoſed unto either <hi>Eminently,</hi> or <hi>Extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall denominations.</hi>

                     <p>The former doe ſo eſſentially imply ſome imperfection, limitation, or compoſition, as that they cannot poſſibly be abſtracted therefrom, and therefore are aſcribed unto God only <hi>eminently</hi> or <hi>vertually.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now the latter doe include no imperfection, or repugnancy with, or oppoſition unto any greater, or equall perfection. And theſe perfections are aſcribed unto God <hi>Formally,</hi> as you may ſee proved by <hi>Suarez Met.

Adde in his perfectionibus non poſſe cogitari altiorem modum continendi illas, quam formaliter, quia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra ſuam formalem rationem, nec limitationem, nec imperfectionem inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt, neque altior gradus Entis excogitari poteſt, quam ille, ad quem hae for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males perfectiones pertinent, qualia ſunt vivere, ſapere &amp; alia hujuſmodi.</hi>

                     <p>Had you lived in thoſe times, you could eaſily have put an end to all this great altercation; provided that they would have received that which you take here for a principle, that fore-knowledge is not properly in God. For if this be ſo, then all diſputation concerning the reconciling of Gods fore-knowledge with liberty and contingency is frivolous, and to no purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>What anxious diſputes have been amongſt the Schoolemen for many hundred yeares continuance touching the manner or the ground of Gods foreknowing future contingents? <hi>Bonaventure</hi> maintained that God did foreknow future contingents by the Idea's of them in his mind. <hi>Aquinas</hi> made the ground of Gods foreknowing them to be their <hi>preſence or exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence in eternity. Scotus</hi> his opinion was, that God foreknows them by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the determination of his own will touching their coming to paſſe. Other grounds of Gods foreknowledge of future contingents are aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by others, which you may find mentioned almoſt in every Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. <hi>Bellarm. l.</hi> 4. <hi>de grat: &amp; libero Arbitrio,</hi> and before him <hi>Occam</hi> and <hi>Ariminenſis</hi> were of an opinion, that the way, or manner of Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing future contingents, is a poynt that is incomprehenſible, &amp; unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible in this life. Were you called to be an Umpier between theſe great Schoolemen in this thorny, and knotty Queſtion, you, inſtead of unlooſing or untying this <hi>Gordian</hi> knot, would like another <hi>Alexander</hi> have cut it in pieces, and have told them that they diſputed like a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Buzzards</hi> concerning the ground or manner of that which may in propriety of ſpeech be denied of God. Your opinion you ſee doth not ſo fully accord with ancient and Moderne Divinity, as you pretend, &amp; how diſſonant it is from the truth will ſoon be manifeſted, by bringing it unto the rule of Theologicall truth, the Scriptures, in which the infallible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of things to come, doe clearly and abundantly witneſſe, that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge is properly in God: for prediction preſuppoſeth preſcience, it being utterly impoſſible to foretell infallibly what one doth not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know certainly. Hereupon it was that <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid <hi>Deum, quot fecit Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet as, tot habere teſtes praeſcientiae ſuae lib.</hi> 2. <hi>contra Marcion. c.</hi> 5.

                        <hi>are Gods.</hi> He that is God can ſhew the things that are to come hereafter, and therefore he foreknowes them; for that cannot be foretold, which is not foreknown. And that without a Metaphor, or any other Trope.</p>
                     <p>From Scripture goe we to naturall reaſon, and that will prove, that foreknowledge agrees <hi>properly</hi> unto God. Arguments of this ſort may be drawn, Firſt from the nature of foreknowledge. Secondly from ſeverall attributes of God. Thirdly from his actuall providence or efficiency.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, from the nature of foreknowledge. Foreknowledge is a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things before their exiſtence. And in God there is a knowledge of things before their exiſtence. <hi>Thou understandest</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) my thoughts a farre off. Pſal.</hi> 139. 2. This argument you may find in D. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> againſt <hi>Jackson.</hi> p. 314. Till things doe coexiſt with God, his knowledge of them, ſaith he, is foreknowledge of them, as well as ours. For it is before them, and only before them; for it is neither with them, nor after them. Not with them, for then they ſhould coexiſt with God, and that from all eternity, which is moſt untrue; for if they did coexiſt with God, then they did exiſt, and that from all eternity, which is moſt untrue. much leſſe is it after them, for if ſo, then their coexiſtence with God were paſt: but we ſuppoſe it to be to come. And impoſſible it is that the ſame things ſhould at once be both paſt, and alſo to come. You have it alſo in <hi>Suarez</hi> in the place before quoted. <hi>In omni etiam proprietate cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimum eſt ſcientiam Dei, ſicut &amp; Deum ipſum duratione antecedere omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um rerum creat arum existentiam.</hi> It is moſt certain that the knowledge of God, as well as God himſelfe, doth properly or in all propriety of ſpeech antecede in duration the exiſtence of all created things whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and therefore it is properly foreknowledge. Unto <hi>Suarez</hi> who is no enemy unto Arminianiſme, I ſhall adde D. <hi>Jackson</hi> a profeſſed Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an arguing after the like manner in his <hi>Treatiſe of the Divine eſſence and Attributes</hi> Sect. 2. Cap. 8. p. 105. <hi>If God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as all grant, be before all worlds, his knowledge being coeternall to his being, must needs be before all worlds.</hi> And <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelfe grants a <hi>ſcientia</hi> a ſcience, or knowledge in God moſt infallible, of all things that have been, are, or ſhall be, before they are, were, or could be; for they could not be coeternall to him, who is before all worlds, the beginning of the World it ſelfe, and of all things in it. Now all knowledge of things not yet preſent, but to come, is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge: to determine or decree things future, is to predetermine or fore-decree them. And ſeeing God from eternity hath both known, and decreed the things that then were not, he is ſaid; to have foreknown and fore-decreed them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Arguments proving foreknowledge to be properly in God may be taken from Gods Attributes; from his infinite perfection, from his infinite happineſſe, or bleſſedneſſe, from his unchangeableneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, from his infinite perfection: He is of all beings the beſt, and moſt perfect, <hi>Deus optimus maximus</hi> was a title that the ancient Romans by the light of nature gave him. Nothing then can ſo much as be imagined to be better then God. But 'tis better to know things to come, then to be ignorant of them, And therefore we muſt either deny that there is a God, or elſe aſcribe unto him the knowledge of things to come. This is Doctor <hi>Twiſſe</hi> his argument <hi>De ſcientiâ media pag.</hi> 246. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ſi Deus is ſit, quo nihil melius excogitari poteſt, &amp; melius ſit cognoſcere futura, &amp; quicquid co gnoſcibile est, quam ignorare; videtur hinc ſequi, aut Deum prorſus negandum eſſe, aut ſcientiam futurorum contingentium ei tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buendam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="228" facs="tcp:56120:279"/>
Secondly, from his infinite bleſſedneſſe or happineſſe, which is ſuch as that he hath all things deſireable. But if he ſhould not have knowne things to come he ſhould be without a perfection, deſireable by every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent or rationall nature. This was <hi>Bradwardines</hi> argument; <hi>Si De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us quaedam vera neſciret, poſſet deſiderare &amp; velle ſcire illa; omnis enim ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalis natura naturaliter ſcire deſiderat, quare &amp; cum per partem proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam habeat voluntatem univerſaliter efficacem, poſſet illa ſcire &amp; non no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitèr; quia tunc non ſemper eſſet actualiſſimus, ſcientiſsimus, perfectiſſimus, beatiſſimus, &amp; immutailis penitus, contra tertiam partem &amp; ſextam: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſario ergo aeternalitèr omnia vera novit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, from his unchangeableneſſe, which is affirmable of all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Attributes, and conſequently of his knowledge. But now his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge if it were not of things whileſt they were to come, it would by actuall exiſtence of them be enlarged, and ſo changed. This argument is urged by <hi>Durand, Cumel, Rada, Suarez,</hi> and others. God knowes thing whiles preſent, for otherwiſe he ſhould be ignorant of that which men and Angells know, therefore he knew them whiles future, otherwiſe by the preſence of them, ſomething <hi>de novo</hi> ſhould accrue unto Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which cannot be without a change. <note place="margin">Conſtat <hi>(ſaith</hi> Durand) quod Deus cognoſcit contingens dum eſt praeſens, putà Socratem currere. alioquin ego cognoſcerem illud quod Deus ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret: ſi ergo non cognoſcebat hoc prius quando fuit futurum, ſequeretur quod aliquid accreviſſet ſuae ſcientiae quod eſt impoſſibile. <hi>In</hi> 1. <hi>lib.

This knowledge of them therefore is not ſo much abſtractive as intuitive, not <note place="margin">Parres per quandam ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggeratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem locuti ſunt ut declararent perfectionem ſcientiae, quam Deus habet de futuris; nam illa tam clare &amp; diſtinctè cum omnibus circumſtantiis intuetur, ac ſi pra ſentia actu jam exiſterent: ideoq, ſcientia illa non eſt abſtractiva, ſed propriiſſima intuitio.

                     </p>
                     <p>To make this matter more plaine, I ſhall diſtinguiſh of a twofold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of <hi>Univocall;</hi> one <hi>Logicall,</hi> the other <hi>Metaphyſicall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt <hi>Logicall,</hi> in which 'tis adequately oppoſed unto <hi>equivocall,</hi> and ſo every predicate is <hi>univocall,</hi> that is, not purely, &amp; meerly <hi>equivocall,</hi> which
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:56120:282"/>
imparts only its name, and not any common ſignification thereof. Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates thus <hi>Univocall,</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>Logically univocall,</hi> becauſe this kind of univocation is ſufficient as to Logicall ends and purpoſes, as for the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a contradiction, and to be the middle terme in a demonſtration.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there is a <hi>Metaphyſicall</hi> acception of <hi>Univocall,</hi> in which 'tis inadequately oppoſed unto <hi>Equivocall,</hi> that is, partly unto <hi>Equivocall,</hi> and partly unto <hi>Analogicall.</hi> An <hi>Equivocall</hi> predicate only imparts its name, and not any common ſignification thereof. An <hi>Analogicall</hi> predicate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts both its name and ſignification unto the things of which it is predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, but unequally, in regard of that inequality, which is of eſſentiall dependency, <hi>ſecundum prius &amp; posterius,</hi> as they ſay; ſo <hi>Ens</hi> is predicated of <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> and <hi>Accident; analogically</hi> of <hi>ſubſtance</hi> in the firſt place, and primarily, as its principall analogate; of <hi>Accident</hi> in the ſecond place, with attribution, order, or reference unto, and dependance upon ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things thus premiſed, I lay downe theſe two concluſions, againſt which whatſoever you object I ſhall be ready to anſwer.</p>
                     <p>The firſt concluſion, Diverſe attributes, which denominate God, and the Creature, are predicated of them <hi>univocally</hi> in a <hi>Logicall</hi> acception of <hi>Univocall,</hi> as it is adequately oppoſed unto <hi>Equivocall;</hi> that is, they are not predicated of God, and the Creature, meerely and purely <hi>Equivocally.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For firſt, not only the bare words, but a common and abſtracted ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of them is found both in God and the Creature, I might inſtance in <hi>Ens,</hi> ſubſtance, goodneſſe, wiſdome, juſtice, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe otherwiſe nothing can be known, or demonſtrated of God by, or from the creatures, but ſtill there would be the <hi>fallacy of equivocation, Ex cognitione unius aequivocati nihil poteſt cognoſci alterius:</hi> And this is as well againſt the Philoſopher, who proveth many things demonſtratively of God; as againſt the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. ſaying, <hi>The inviſible things of him from the creation of the World are clearely ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternall power, and Godhead, ſo that they are without excuſe.</hi> This is a reaſon given by <hi>Aquinas. p.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 13. <hi>art.</hi> 5. <hi>Nomina quae dicuntur de Deo &amp; creaturis, non dicuntur purè aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocè ut aliqui dixerunt. Quia ſecundum hoc ex creaturis nil poſſit cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſci de Deo, nec demonſtrari, ſed ſemper incideret fallacia aequivocationis, &amp; hoc eſt tam contra Philoſophum</hi> 8. <hi>Phyſ.</hi> 12. <hi>Metaph. qui multa demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive de Deo probat, quam etiam contra Apostolum dicentem. Roman.</hi> 1. <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilia Dei, per ea quae facta ſunt, intellect a conſpiciuntur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is all that the Scotiſts can prove by their arguments, which they bring to prove the Univocation of <hi>Ens,</hi> as predicated of God and the creature; and this they fully and ſtrongly prove. And indeed if the matter be well looked into, the contention here between the Thomiſts and the Scotiſts, is a meere ſtrife of words, <hi>de modo loquendi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond concluſion, No attribute whatſoever denominating God and the creature, is predicated of them <hi>univocally,</hi> as <hi>Univocall</hi> is oppoſed unto <hi>Analogicall:</hi> for thoſe attibutes which doe agree unto God moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, are predicated of God, &amp; the creature unequally, in poynt of eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial order; of God primarily, &amp; independently, of the creature ſecondarily, &amp; dependently, with relation unto God. In God they are by his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> in the creatures but <hi>by participation.</hi> This I might exemplify by inſtancing in that which is under debate, infallible knowledge of things to come, that are contingent, is affirmed of God chiefly, &amp; in the firſt place; of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture only dependently upon, &amp; derivedly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God: whereupon an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, underived, &amp; independent foreknowledge of future contingents is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable

                     <p>Before I take my leave of this ſection, I ſhall deſire you, that whereas I affirme, that what words are attributable unto God <hi>properly, dicuntur de Deo prius quam de creaturis,</hi> you would be pleaſed to underſtand it in regard of the things, or perfections ſignified by thoſe words, and not barely in regard of their impoſition.

                     <p>IF it be objected, that this argument lieth as ſtrong against the propriety of knowledge, as of foreknowledge in God; in as much as foreknowledge is every whit as <hi>Properly</hi> and <hi>Formally</hi> in the Creature, as knowledge; I anſwer</p>
                     <p>True it is, there is no knowledge neither in God, according to the preciſe and formall notion of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or in ſuch a ſenſe, wherein it is found in men. And this the first and last of the three reaſons mentioned doe infallibly demonſtrate. Knowledge in the creature is a principle or habit, <hi>really</hi> and <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially</hi> distinct from the ſubject, or ſoule, wherein it reſideth: yea and is capable of augmentation and diminution therein, and of ſeparation from its Whereas that which is called <hi>knowledge</hi> in God, neither differs <hi>really</hi> or <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially</hi> from his nature, or from himſelfe, but is <hi>really</hi> one and the ſame thing with him (as will farther appeare in the following Chapter) nor is it either capable of growth, or of decay, or of ſeparation. Only in this reſpect, knowledge of the two, is more properly attributable unto God, then foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe foreknowledge in the proper notion, or formall conception of it, includes or ſuppoſeth a liableneſſe to a change or expiration <hi>(viz.</hi> upon the comming to paſſe of the thing foreknown; which muſt of neceſſity come to paſſe in time) whereas knowledge imports nothing, but what may be permanent and perpetuall, and ſo is (of the two) more appropriable unto him, who chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not.</p>

                        </note> becauſe (ſaith he) he doth not hereby ſo much ſignify what himſelfe willeth to be done, as what is our duty to doe. I confeſſe that no ſignification whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, whether of what a man willeth, or decreeth to be done, or of what is the duty of another to doe, can properly be ſaid to be the will of the ſignifier: but yet that will, wherewith, or out of which, God willeth or commandeth us to doe, that which is our duty to doe, is as properly his will, as that whereby he willeth, or decreeth things to be done. My will, or deſire, that my Child ſhould obey me, or, that he ſhould proſper in the world, is as properly my will, as that, whereby I will or purpoſe, to ſhew the reſpects of a father unto him in providing for him; being as proper, naturall, and direct an act of that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or faculty of willing within m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, whereby <hi>I will</hi> the latter, as that act it ſelfe of this faculty, wherein I will the latter, is. For the Principle or faculty within me of willing, how numerous or different ſoever the acts of willing, which I exert by vertue of this faculty, may be, is but one and the ſame. And this faculty being naturall, there can be no ſuch difference between the acts proceeding from it, which ſhould make ſome to be more proper, and others leſſe; though ſome may be better, and others worſe, But this difference can have no place in the acts of the will of God. Therefore if the precept, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive will of God, be not properly his will; neither can any other will of his, or any other act of his will, be properly ſuch. If ſo, then that will of God, or act of will in God, whereby he willeth or injoyneth faith and repentance, and conſequently, ſalvation, unto all men, is as properly his will as that whereby he willeth the ſalvation of any man. Therefore if there be any ſecret or unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will in God, whereby he willeth the deſtruction of any man, at the ſame time when he willeth the ſalvation of All men, (be it with what kind of will ſoever) theſe two wills must needs enter-feare, and contradict the one the other. Nor will that diſtinction of the late mentioned Author ſalve a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistency between them, wherein he diſtinguiſheth, between the <hi>Decree</hi> of God, and <hi>the thing decreed</hi> by him; affirming, that the thing which God decreeth, may be repugnant to, or inconſiſtent with, the thing which he commandeth; though the decree it ſelfe cannot be repugnant to the Command <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <p>The will of God properly ſo called is uncapable of interruption, rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, and multiplication, for in eternity there is a moſt abſolute and perfect unity and indiviſibility without any ſucceſſion of parts, but now the Commands of God may be very often reiterated and multiplied, precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line. <hi>Eſay</hi> 28. 10. <hi>Oh Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, how often would I have gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thy children together.

How Gods commandements and other ſignes of his will, are the will of God <hi>Metaphorically, Aquinas</hi> illuſtrates in the place but now quoted; ſeeing paſſions are aſcribed unto God only <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> hence the ſignes of ſuch paſſions in us, when aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed unto God, are called by the names of the paſſions themſelves.

Now we ſay, even Gods commandement notes the will of God alſo in proper ſpeech, to wit, what ſhall be our duty to doe; for undoubtedly whatſoever God commands us, it is his will in proper ſpeech, that it ſhall be our duty to doe it.

D. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> (you ſee) roundly expreſſeth himſelfe, that it ſignifieth, or revealeth Gods will of obligation, what he will oblige and bind men unto; what he will have to be their duty: but it doth not at all ſignify the will of Gods purpoſe concerning what ſhall come to paſſe actually; it doth not ſignify Gods will of operation or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, <hi>i. e.</hi> it doth not reveale what good God hath decreed to worke, what evill he hath decreed to ſuffer or permit in all thoſe to whom his commands are given; briefly, it ſignifieth or revealeth mans duty, and Gods will of obliging unto it. <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee O man what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to doe justly, and to love mercy, and to walke humbly with thy God.

                     <p>That Gods decrees are <hi>properly</hi> the will of God, may be demonſtrated out of moſt Schoolemen; that they are properly acts of Gods will I deny, and that for two reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If Gods decrees were properly acts of his will, then his will were properly a power, But his will is not properly a power, for will is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto God, not as a power diſtinct from the act, but as an act not <hi>eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite</hi> but <hi>ſubſisting:</hi> And here I ſhall give you the words and reaſons of <hi>Suarez,</hi> then whom there are few Moderne Schoolemen more rationall.

                     <p>That things commanded and decreed by God, may be contradictory, the Doctor proveth by undenyable inſtances. The ſacrificing of <hi>Iſaack,</hi> and the not ſacrificing of <hi>Iſaack,</hi> are <hi>termes contradictory;</hi> but the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of <hi>Iſaack</hi> was the object of Gods command to <hi>Abraham. Gen.</hi> 22. 2. The not ſacrificing of <hi>Iſaack</hi> was the object of Gods decree, as appears by the event. <hi>v.</hi> 11. 12. Therefore the object of Gods commandement, and the object of his decree, may be <hi>contradictory.</hi> Againe, the letting of Iſraell goe out of Aegypt, and the not letting of Iſraell goe out of Aegypt are <hi>termes contradictory;</hi> but the letting of Iſraell goe was commanded unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> his not letting of Iſraell goe was decreed and determined by God. <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. 2, 3. and 10. 1, 2. God told <hi>Moſes</hi> that he would harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, that he ſhould not let Iſraell goe. Therefore a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God, and a thing decreed by God, may be <hi>contradictory.</hi> Concerning the firſt of theſe inſtances, you ſay ſomething pag. 451, 452. But there is nothing argumentative in what you ſay, but may receive an anſwer from your own rule of interpreting Scripture. pag. 92. 99. 108. 109. In the next place the Doctor proves, that the commandements and the decrees of God are not repugnant. <hi>Nec tamen decretum pugnare cum mandato, ſic probamus. Mandato ſignificat Deus quid ſit noſtri officii, ut a nobis fieri debeat; decretum vero divinum nihil aliud eſt, quam propoſitum divinum de aliquo, ut vel fiat, vel impediatur ne fiat, idque efficaciter. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datum docet quid ipſe probaturus ſit, ſi modo ab homine fiat, quid improbatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus ſi non fiat: decretum ſtatuit quid ipſe facturus ſit, aut impediturus, ne ſit. Iſta autem non pugnant; tui eſt officii ut hoc facias, ſed non est mei propoſiti per gratiam efficere ut facias. Pari ratione poteſt Deus mandare alicui fidem, &amp; reſipiſcentiam, &amp; interea apud ſe statuere, quod non credat, aut reſipiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, negando ſcilicet gratiam efficacem, qua ſola fieri poteſt ut credat aut re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipiſcat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God by his command ſignifieth, and ſheweth what is our duty, what ought to be done, or left undone by us; Gods decree is nothing elſe, but his purpoſe that things ſhall come to paſſe, or not come to paſſe; the command teacheth, what God will approve or diſapprove; his decree de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth, what he himſelfe will doe or hinder, &amp;c. Now theſe are no waies repugnant. It is thy duty to doe this, but it is not Gods purpoſe to give thee grace for the doing of it: Thou art bound or obliged to doe this, but yet thou ſhalt never actually doe it: faith and repentance are thy duty, and yet thy faith and thy repentance ſhall never actually exiſt, or come to paſſe. By this that the Doctor hath ſaid it is plaine, that there is no oppoſition between Gods command to all that heare the Goſpell,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56120:288"/>
believe, and repent, and his purpoſe of denying faith and repentance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many, nay moſt of them. And thus you ſee what the Doctor hath to ſay for himſelfe, let us next heare what you can ſay againſt him.</p>

                     <p>What hath been ſaid is ſufficient to convince him, that will not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and obſtinately ſhut his eyes againſt the light, that the command of all who heare the Goſpell to believe and repent, and the purpoſe of God to deny faith and repentance unto many, are not contradictory. I ſhall, before I diſcharge my ſelfe of this Section, evince as much briefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this latter purpoſe, and that purpoſe or decree out of which the command proceedeth, and which is ſignified thereby.</p>
                     <p>Here we muſt premiſe, that the commandement of God doth ſignify a <hi>decree or decreeing</hi> will of God, though not ſuch a decree or will as the Arminians uſually ſhape for themſelves. 1. It ſignifieth the decree of God concerning the commandement it ſelfe, 2. Concerning the thing commanded.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, the command of God ſignifieth Gods will or decree of the commandement it ſelfe, of the <hi>externall tranſient act of commanding. Eph.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>God worketh all things after the Counſell of his own will.</hi> Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding then of things in time, is a ſigne that from everlaſting he did decree to command them. But ſecondly, It ſignifieth a will or decree of God alſo concerning the thing commanded, <hi>viz,</hi> as <hi>touching the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it,</hi> not as <hi>touching the exiſtence or non-existence of it,</hi> it ſignifieth, that God from everlaſting did decree, that the thing commanded ſhould be mans duty, ſhould be a thing <hi>Morally</hi> good, but it doth not ſignify or reveale, that the thing commanded ſhould actually exiſt, and be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by every one unto whom the command is propounded. Indeed the obedience of the elect, for whoſe ſalvation only the commands of God are given, was both commanded and decreed, or determined by God <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26, 27. And hence we may inferre, that the command of faith, repentance, obedience, &amp;c. all which God hath determined to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary unto ſalvation, doe imply, and reveale in a generall, and indefinite way, that God from eternity did purpoſe to worke faith, repentance, and obedience in thoſe, whom he had deſigned to ſalvation. But this conceſſion will not ſatisfy Arminians, who will be contented with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56120:289"/>
unleſſe we will grant them, that God willeth and deſireth the faith, repentance, obedience, and ſalvation of Reprobates; which we cannot doe, but withall we muſt renounce and diſclaime Gods omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and immutability.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things thus briefely premiſed, That Gods purpoſe or decree of commanding faith, and repentance unto all that heare the Goſpel, and his purpoſe or decree to deny faith and repentance unto many, are not contradictory, is manifeſt: becauſe Gods purpoſe or decree of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith and repentance, referres unto the thing commanded, faith and repentance, only as concerning the <hi>obligation to them, not as touching the existence of them;</hi> now to decree and purpoſe, to bind and oblige all to faith and repentance, and to decree and purpoſe, that ſome yet ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver actually believe and repent, cannot be proved by any rules of Logick to be contradictory.</p>

(the place which you have under debate,) as well as you, though, I confeſſe, upon different grounds.

                     <p>The interpretation of this place, which D. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> ſticks to, is that of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that God will have ſome of all ſorts or conditions to be ſaved, and he makes it good from the coherence, as here, ſo in his conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the doctrine of the Synod of <hi>Arles</hi> and <hi>Dort</hi> &amp;c. p. 61. and p. 62, 63, 64. he gives a full and ſatisfactory anſwer unto that which you call more then a <hi>Topicke argument</hi> againſt this expoſition, unto which why you doe not reply, I cannot but wonder, but perhaps you never read it; And yet againe 'tis very ſtrange, that you, who have ſearched ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly and throughly into theſe controverſies, as you profeſſe, ſhould be unread in all the workes of him, whom you confeſſe to be one of the greateſt Patrons of the Adverſe cauſe (as you call it) I will lay downe that which you call more then a Topicke argument, and compare it with

                     <head>DR TWISSE upon the Synod of <hi>Arles &amp;c.</hi> Pag. 62, 63, 64.</head>
                     <p>I Deny that the Scripture ought with much more reaſon, or with any reaſon to ſay, that God would have all men to be damned, although put the caſe that in every Nation &amp; condition there be more of theſe, than of them; and his reaſon drawne from the denomination to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the major part is nothing to the preſent purpoſe. For the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion here about the interpretation of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> phraſe is only this, whether the word <hi>All</hi> be to be interpreted of all ſorts, or of all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one; ſo that the rule of denomination taken from the major part is nothing pertinent to this, The queſtion being only, whether <hi>genera ſingulorum,</hi> or <hi>ſingula generum</hi> be here meant, not whether ſome of all ſorts, or all and every one of all ſorts. Which being reſolved, and that hereby is meant, <hi>genera ſingulorum,</hi> it may be farther queſtioned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>genera ſingulorum</hi> doe imply every particular of theſe kinds, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome of them? For it is well known, that the phraſe is indifferent to the one as well as the other, and that <hi>genera ſingulorum,</hi> are equally preſerved entire in ſome particulars, as in many, or moſt, or all. Like as the Species of the Sunne is maintained exactly as well in that one Sunne, which ſhines by day in the firmament, as if there were twenty Sunnes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, though the reaſon here given from the denomination to be taken from the greater part, were pertinent, yet were it nothing pertinent to the Apoſtles purpoſe in this place, to ſay, that God would have all men to be damned; For this were no agreeable reaſon to move them to pray for all, for Kings, and all that are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay thus, I will have you to pray for all, for God will have all to be damned; for ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> if Gods Church knew who were predeſtinated to be ſent into eternall fire with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell and his Angells, they would no more pray for ſuch, than they would pray for the Divell himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>So that this Author doth miſerably overlaſh in this his ſubtilty, and betraies more nakedneſſe than any ſober and wiſe Infidell were like to doe.</p>
                     <p>Then againe, the inſtances of Scripture are clearely againſt him. For when every foure-footed beaſt (as the Scripture ſpeakes) was ſeen by <hi>Peter</hi> in a viſion; in all likelyhood they were not the moſt part of every kind, but the ſmalleſt rather of every kind: and accordingly this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor might conclude, that conſidering denominations are taken from the major part, therefore it is rather to be ſaid, that every foure-footed beaſt was not ſeen by <hi>Peter,</hi> for certainly the major part of every kind was not; yet in this ſenſe to ſpeake of it, in that caſe was nothing perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, but rather contrariant to that which followeth: Riſe <hi>Peter,</hi> kill and eate..</p>
                     <p>In like ſort ſeeing in all likelihood more people ſtaid at home both in Jeruſalem, and in Judea, then were they who went out to <hi>John,</hi> and according to this Authors rule, it were more fit to ſay, All Jeruſalem and all Judea ſtaid at home, when <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt Preached: yet was it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing congruous, but contrariant rather to the Evangeliſts ſcope to write ſo; His purpoſe being to ſet downe of what eſtimation was the authority of <hi>Iohn</hi> by the confluence of all people from all parts unto him &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:56120:290"/>
when he writes that all Judea, and all Jeruſalem went forth unto him, the meaning can be no more than this, namely, that from all parts of Judea and of Jeruſalem ſome flocked unto him.</p>

                     <p>HAnging upon the Croſſe he prayed for his enemies, and thoſe that crucified him, that they might be forgiven. May it not as well be inferred from hence, that therefore all his enemies, and all ſuch, who (in any ſenſe) crucify him, ſhall be forgiven by God; as it is argued from his praying for <hi>Peter,</hi> that his faith might not faile, that the faith of no true believer ſhall faile. <hi>Doctor Twiſſes</hi> notion upon the caſe is not ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique; and though admitted, will not heale the difficulty: Chriſt (ſaith he) prayed for his enemies, <hi>ex officio hominis privati,</hi> i. e. according to the duty of a private man, but for his elect, as Mediator. This is ſaid but not proved, nor indeed probable. For very unlikely it is, that Christ being now in a full inveſtiture of his great office of Mediator, ſhould wave his intereſt in Heaven, by meanes hereof in his addreſſements unto God for men, and pray only in the capacity, and according to the interest and duty of a private man; This would argue, that he prayed not for them with his whole heart, nor with an effectualneſſe of deſire to obtaine what he prayed for. But let it be granted, yet still it followes, that whatſoever Chriſt prayed for, was not ſimply, or abſolutely granted or done; and if whatſoever Christ prayed for, was abſolutely granted, it is not materiall, as to matter of impetration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he prayed as Mediator, or as a private man. But the intent of Chriſts Prayer for thoſe that crucified him, was not that all their ſinnes ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given them, much leſſe that ſimply and abſolutely <hi>(i. e.</hi> without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening of faith and repentance) they ſhould be forgiven (which had been to pray for that which is expreſſely contrary unto the revealed will of God) but that that particular ſinne of their crucifying him ſhold be forgivem them <hi>i. e.</hi> ſhould not be imputed unto them, by way of barre unto their repentance, either by any ſuddaine or ſpeedy destruction; or by delivering them up to ſuch a ſpirit of obſtinacy or obduration, under which men ſeldome or never repent.</p>

                     <p>THis expoſition of D. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> proceeds upon ſuppoſition, (not grant) that Chriſt prayed for all that had a hand in his crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and taking this ſuppoſition to be true, this following argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the proofe of this expoſition, may eaſily be gathered out of D. <hi>Twiſſe.</hi> If Chriſt prayed for all that crucifyed him, then either according to the duty of a private perſon, or by vertue of his office, as he was Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; but he prayed not for all his perſecutors by vertue of his office, as he was a Mediatour: therefore if he prayed for them, it was only in anſwer of his duty, as he was made under the Law, and a private perſon. The Minor which is only likely to be queſtioned, is thus confirmed; ſome that were guilty of his crucifying, were in all likelihood Reprobates, as is not only confeſſed, but proved by <hi>Arminius. Oravit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>pro iis qui crucifixerunt eum, pro inimicis ſuis, inter quos &amp; non-electi fuerunt: Pinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes enim ſaeculi crucifixerunt illum; at plurimis illorum ſapientia Dei, &amp; virtus quae est Chriſtus, non eſt revelata.</hi> The <hi>Princes of the World crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. And unto moſt of them the wiſdome and power of God, which is Chriſt, is not revealed. Now in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 9. where we have the modell, rule, or Epitome of Chriſts interceſſion, that is, of his praying as Mediator, he diſclaimes all prayer, and conſequently me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation for Reprobates. <hi>I pray not for the World, but for them which thou hast given me.</hi> Where <hi>World</hi> is taken <hi>pro turbà Reproborum &amp;c.</hi> (ſaith D. <hi>Twiſſe)</hi> for the rout or rabble of Reprobates: and he proves it thus; <hi>In his, Mundus opponitur iis qui dantur Christo a Patre; at dari a patre, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat ſtatum electionis. Ioh.</hi> 6. 39. <hi>Significat enim ſtatum bonum praecedaneum vocationi efficaci; omne quod dat mihi pater, veniet ad me. Venire autem ad Chriſtum, est credere in Chriſtum per vocationem efficacem. Vind. l.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 181. The <hi>World</hi> in theſe words is oppoſed, unto them which are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto Chriſt by the Father; but to be given unto Chriſt by the Father, ſignifieth the ſtate of election, for it ſignifieth a good and happy eſtate or condition, precedaneous unto effectuall vocation. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come unto me;</hi> but to come unto Chriſt, is to believe in Chriſt, by an effectuall vocation. Thus you ſee, that notwithſtanding your pleaſure to ſay otherwiſe, it is not barely ſaid but proved by him, that Chriſt prayed not for all his Crucifyers by vertue of his office as he was Mediator.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, that Chriſt according to the duty of a private man, might pray for all that crucified him, even for thoſe of them that were not elect, is rendred probable by two arguments in D. <hi>Twiſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt is, Chriſts ſubjection unto the Law. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>He was made under the Law:</hi> and therefore <hi>bound to fulfill all righteouſneſſe. Math.</hi> 3. 15. And one branch of the Law, as is evident, by Chriſt his own gloſſe upon it, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. is to <hi>love our enemies,</hi> to forgive private &amp; perſonall wrongs, to <hi>pray for them which deſpitefully uſe us, and perſecute us.</hi> this was a poynt that he preſſed much upon his Diſciples in his life time, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a duty (though of frequent uſe) yet difficult and harſh unto fleſh and bloud, it is not unlikely but that he might exemplify it by his own practice at his death.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond Argument in D. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> to prove that it is not improbable that Chriſt as a private man, <hi>affectu humano,</hi> prayed on his Croſſe for all
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:56120:291"/>
his Crucifyers, even ſuch of them as he knew, not to belong unto the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of grace, is drawn from compariſon of ſuch a prayer, with the like prayer, that Chriſt made in his agony in the Garden, <hi>O my Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſſe from me. Math.</hi> 26. 39. Father, if thou <hi>be willing,</hi> remove this cup from me. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 42. This bitter cup of his death and Paſſion, he knew full well that he was to drinke up, as a Mediator for his elect, both by his Fathers decree, call, command, as alſo by his own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary undertaking; for to this end and purpoſe he came into the World, and ſanctified himſelfe. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 19. and therefore though theſe words were part of a moſt ſolemne addreſſement unto God, yet were they not put up by him in the capacity, and according to the duty and intereſt of a Mediator for his elect. <hi>Twiſſe Vindic. l.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 188. And this is enough to ſatisfy you, that you are out in paſſing your cenſure upon D. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> his notion on this place, <hi>that it is ſaid not proved,</hi> which I am perſwaded you would have forborne, if you had ſo throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed him, as it was fit you ſhould, before you had in publike thus cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him.</p>

                     <p>FIrſt, you cannot deny but that in theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Father if it be poſſible,</hi> or <hi>if it be thy will, let this cup paſſe from me,</hi> Chriſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not as a Mediator for his elect, for ſo he was ingaged to drinke off this Cup; but as a man naturally declining, and abhorring death, and the ignominy of the Croſſe, as they are in themſelves evill: and yet all your arguments, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> with due change may be applied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this interpretation, as well as unto D. <hi>Twiſſe his notion</hi> (as you call it) upon <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 34.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in anſwer unto your objections, we may make uſe of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of prayer, brought by <hi>Suarez</hi> in <hi>tertiam partem Sum. Aquin. q.</hi> 21. <hi>Art.</hi> 4. <hi>Prayer is nothing elſe but an unfolding of the will unto God.</hi> Now in Chriſts manhood there was a twofold will, one <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>effectuall,</hi> another <hi>conditionall</hi> and <hi>uneffectuall,</hi> which may otherwiſe be termed, a <hi>velleity,</hi> a will of ſimple <hi>complacency,</hi> a will of a thing only <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> in ſome particular reſpect, according to ſome particular conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: of ſuch a will of his we read. <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. 24. <hi>He entred into an houſe, and would have no man know it, but he could not be hid.</hi> Anſwerable unto theſe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56120:292"/>
two acts of the will in Chriſt, there may be attributed unto Chriſt two ſorts or <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>prayer;</hi> one proceeding from an <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>effectuall will,</hi> and this was alwaies heard: the other from a <hi>conditionall and unef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall</hi> will, and this was not alwaies heard; ſuch was his prayer in his agony, <hi>let this cup paſſe from me:</hi> and of this ſort or kind of prayer, is that paſſage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 2. In reference unto Chriſt, underſtood, <hi>O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou heareſt not, and in the night ſeaſon and am not ſilent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to apply this diſtinction, Chriſt could not pray as a private man for thoſe of his perſecutors, for whom he did not pray as a Mediator, if we ſpeake of that kind of Prayer, which cometh from an abſolute and effectuall will, which is ſtyled by <hi>Gregory de Valentia, Voluntas rationis undequaque deliberatae,</hi> becauſe it proceedeth upon regard had to all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: And the reaſon is, becauſe with this kind of Prayer, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prayed for any thing, but what he knew would be granted; for he never abſolutely and effectually willed any thing, but what was agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto Gods abſolute will, the will of his decree or good pleaſure, and this is all that your arguments can prove. But yet notwithſtanding this, he might pray (taking prayer for a repreſentation of a conditionall or uneffectuall will) for the pardon of even thoſe of his perſecutors, who he knew ſhould be condemned, and for whom therefore he prayed not as Mediator: or more plainly, he might expreſſe a velleity, a gracious, mercifull, and charitable deſire, to have all his crucifyers pardoned, ſo as it were not contrary unto Gods decree, unto which he did ſubmit, and in which he did acquieſce, as he did in his prayer for the removall of his Paſſion, <hi>not my will but thy will be done.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An anſwer very like unto, if not coincident with this, may be eaſily gathered out of D. <hi>Twiſſe;</hi> and it is, that Chriſt, as a private man, prayed for the pardon of all his perſecutors, taking prayer for an expreſſion of Chriſts antecedent will, not as prayer is a repreſentation of his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent will.</p>
                     <p>An Antecedent will, as <hi>Alvarez</hi> explaines it, is the willing of a thing conſidered abſolutely, as it is in it ſelfe, abſtracting from all other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of it: A conſequent will, is the willing of a thing conſidered with all circumſtances wherewith it is clothed. Thus a Merchant willeth the preſervation of his wares with an antecedent will, as the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his wares is conſidered in it ſelfe; but he doth not will it with a conſequent will, as it is conſidered with this circumſtance, as 'tis accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with hazard, and danger of his life. Thus alſo a judge with an antecedent will, willes the life of a Priſoner, becauſe his life is in it ſelfe, a thing good and deſireable: but he doth not will it with a conſequent will, as he is guilty of Murther, inceſt, or any the like capitall crime.</p>
                     <p>Now D. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> though he reject the application of this diſtinction to God, with whoſe ſimplicity and infinite knowledge ſeverall ſucceſſive conſiderations of one and the ſame thing are utterly incompetible, yet he denyeth not, but it may have place in the manhood of Chriſt. <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne diverſarum conſiderationum non nego</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>diſtinctionem istam competere poſſe in hominem; quippe cui variae conſiderationes occurrere poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt invicem ſuccedentes: ſic Christus naturali ſui conſervandi deſiderio fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebatur, cum a patre peteret, ut calix tranſiret; at conſideratâ voluntate &amp; decreto patris de Calice iſto ad bibendum ipſi propinato, eidem ſe ſubmittere conſultum duxit.</hi> This diſtinction in regard of diverſe conſiderations of one and the ſame thing, may be aſcribed unto man, in whom are found
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:56120:292"/>
ſeverall conſiderations of the ſame thing ſucceeding one another: So Chriſt as man, out of a naturall deſire of ſelfe-preſervation, prayed that the cup of his paſſion might paſſe from him; but the will or decree, the command of his Father, his owne office, and mans ſalvation being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, he ſubmitted himſelfe to the drinking up of this cup, even to the very dreggs; <hi>nevertheleſſe not my will but thy will be done.</hi> Luk. 22. 42. <hi>If this cup may not paſſe away from me except I drinke it, thy will be done.</hi> Mat. 26. 42. He did not will his paſſion with an <hi>Antecedent</hi> will, but he willed it (you ſee) with a <hi>Conſequent will. Joh.</hi> 4. 34. And ſo he prayed againſt it, as a prayer is a propoſall of an Antecedent, not conſequent will.</p>
                     <p>Now that Doctor <hi>Twiſſe</hi> reſembles this prayer of Chriſt, for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of all his crucifyers, unto Chriſts deprecation of his death and paſſion, and makes it to be as that, an expreſſion only of an antecedent will, a deſire of their pardon, conſidered abſolutely in it ſelfe, abſtracting from Gods decree unto the contrary, I ſhall evidence by giving you D. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> his own words. <hi>Vind. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 188. <hi>Non dicit Molinaeus iſtam voluntatem Chriſti hominis, ſecundum quam oravit pro crucifigentibus ipſum, contrariam fuiſſe voluntati divinae; potuit enim fieri cum ſubmiſſione volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati Dei tacite factâ, licet non expreſsà, ad formulam precationis illius: pater tranſeat a me calix iste; Sed non mea voluntas fiat, ſedtua.</hi> And againe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the ſame page. <hi>Annon homini ſanctiſſimo convenit, privatam offenſam remittere, &amp; palam protestari, ſe (niſi Deus aliter statuiſſet) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupere ut ipſis ignoſceret; de quibus tamen Deus aliter forſitan constituerit, quod &amp; ipſi forſitan innoteſcit?

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>more earneſtly,</hi> and his Sweat was as it were great drops of bloud falling downe to the ground. That this prayer was with the whole heart of Chriſt, you will not deny, and yet the former part of this prayer <hi>(if thou be willing remove this cup from me)</hi> was not the prayer of Chriſt as Mediator, but only an expreſſion of an antecedent or conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall will and deſire, like unto this his prayer upon the Croſſe for the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of all his perſecutors.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing conſiderable which can be objected againſt this, but that hereupon it would follow, that ſeeing prayer is a repreſentation of the will before God, that therefore in Chriſt there are two contrary wills, if he prayed for the pardon of all his perſecutors as a private man, and did not pray for it, but rather againſt it, as a Mediator.</p>
                     <p>But this receives a very eaſy ſolution. To will or not to will, or nill one and the ſame object, are not contrary, unleſſe it be in reſpect of the ſame circumſtances or conſiderations. For Chriſt as a private man, out of humane pitty to wiſh and deſire the juſtification of all his crucifiers, as a thing good and deſireable, if God had not decreed otherwiſe; and not to will, but rather nill the juſtification of ſome of them, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that they are not given unto him by the Father, but excluded from ſalvation by the will of his decree or purpoſe; theſe indeed are <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,</hi> but not <hi>repugnant</hi> acts of the will, becauſe they proceed upon gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conſiderations, and therefore though the object be one <hi>materially,</hi> yet 'tis <hi>formally diverſified:</hi> Thus between Chriſts deſire of declining his death, and his willing acceptance thereof, there was a <hi>diverſity,</hi> but no <hi>contrariety,</hi> becauſe they were not in reſpect of the ſame circumſtances; he deſired to decline it, as it was in it ſelfe evill, and contrary to nature; but as the meanes of mans ſalvation, he joyfully embraced it.</p>
                     <p>To cleare this farther, I ſhall propound a diſtinction of contraries out of <hi>Rada. Part.</hi> 3. <hi>Controv.</hi> 10. <hi>Art.</hi> 2. <hi>Contraria ſunt in duplici differentiâ, alia abſoluta, quae a quibuſcun<expan>

                     <p>THis only prooves, what will eaſily be granted, that Chriſt prayed not for all his perſecutors, with a prayer proceeding from an abſolute and effectuall will. But there is one thing which I ſhall not diſſemble, but freely acquaint the Reader with; And it is, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Scholers both Papiſts and Proteſtants doe deny, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall, expreſſion, or repreſentation of a conditionll and uneffectuall will or deſire, is properly a prayer: I ſhall alleadge but two; the firſt ſhall be a Papiſt, to wit, <hi>Becanus Sum. Theol. Tom.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. <hi>q.</hi> 3. <hi>Licet in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>diſtingui debeat duplex voluntas; una efficax, altera ineffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cax: non tamen diſtingui debet duplex oratio, una procedens ex efficaci voluntate, altera ex inefficaci. Nam oratio ſi vere oratio est, ſemper procedit ex abſoluta &amp; efficaci voluntate orantis, nunquam ex inefficaci. Qui enim petit aliquid fieri, efficaciter illud deſiderat, &amp; ideo adhibet orationem, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam medium quoddam ad obtinendum id, quod petit; hinc ſolet dici, orationem natura ſua utilem eſſe ad impetrandum. Unde ſic concludo: qui vult aliquid voluntate inefficaci nullum medium adhibet ad illud obtinendum; quia ſi ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiberet aliquod medium, jam vellet illud voluntate efficaci: at qui orat, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibet aliquod medium ad obtinendum, nempe ipſam orationem: ergo qui orat, non vult voluntate inefficaci, ſed tantum efficaci.</hi> Although in Chriſt there ought to be diſtinguiſhed a two-fold will, one effectuall, another uneffectuall; yet notwithſtanding, prayer ought not in the like manner to be diſtinguiſhed: for there are not two ſorts or kinds of Prayer, one proceeding from an effectuall, the other from an uneffectuall will; for prayer, if it be truly prayer, alwaies proceedeth from an abſolute and effectuall, and never from an uneffectuall will of the party praying: For he that petitioneth for the doing of any thing, doth effectually deſire it, and therefore uſeth Prayer, as a meanes for the obtaining of that which he requeſts: Hence it is wont to be ſaid, that Prayer is in its own nature uſefull or profitable for obtaining or procuring. Whence I conclude thus; He who willeth any thing with an uneffectuall will, applyeth or uſeth no meanes for the procurement thereof; becauſe if he ſhould make uſe of any meanes to procure it, he ſhould will it with an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all will: but he who prayeth, makes uſe of a meanes for the obtaining of what he Praye's for, to wit, Prayer it ſelfe: therefore he who Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, willeth that he prayes for, only with an effectuall, and not with an uneffectuall will. He goes on in the confirmation of this opinion. <hi>Haec ſententia est probabilior: pro quâ nota, aliud eſſe orare; aliud, ſimplex ſeu inefficax deſiderium proponere: quod facile in nobis ostendi &amp; explicari po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test.

                     <p>This opinion is the more probable, for the opening of which we muſt marke, that it is one thing to pray, another thing to propound a ſimple or uneffectuall deſire; which may eaſily be ſhewen and explained in our ſelves; for our Prayer ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with a certain hope or aſſurance of obtaining that which wee pray for. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 6. Let him aske in faith nothing wavering or doubting. <hi>Math.</hi> 21. 22. And all things whatſoever ye ſhall aske in prayer belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ye ſhall receive. But when we propound or manifeſt a bare, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, uneffectuall deſire, we doe not doe it with a certain confidence of obtaining what is ſo deſired, but rather with aſſurance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                     <p>A ſeond teſtimony ſhall be taken out of Doctor <hi>Ames,</hi> an acute and learned Proteſtant. <hi>Coron. art.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>Juxta ſententiam Arminii &amp;c. nulla propria est oratio, quae non ſit abſoluta: quae etiam ſententia non eſt temerè damnanda, cum inniti videatur rationibus non contemnendis; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertim illà, quae deducitur ab orationis natura: Oratio enim est ſubmiſſa re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praeſentatio voluntatis noſtrae apud Deum ut ab ipſo perficiatur. Explicatio velleitatis, quâ quid vellemus, ſi aliud non obſiſteret, non est oratio proprie dicta. jam vero nihil volumus proprie, quod non abſolute volumus; atque adeo nil petimus quod non abſolute petimus, Quamvis in diſpoſitione precantium conditionis ratio virtualiter ſaepe contineatur. Petimus quidem nonnun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam, ut unum fiat ſi alterum contingat; cujus quidem conſequentis rei fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitio ut conditionata ſit rogamus: Sed ipſa tamen petitio est abſoluta, quoniam abſolute petimus, ut poſito uno, ponatur &amp; alterum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>According to the opinion of <hi>Arminius,</hi> there is no proper prayer, but what is abſolute; which opinion is not raſhly to be condemned; ſeeing it ſeems to be grounded upon conſiderable reaſons, eſpecially that which is drawn from the nature of prayer: for prayer is a ſubmiſſe and lowly repreſentation of our wills before God, to the end, it may be performed by him. The unfolding of a velleity, whereby we would will a thing if ſomething did not hinder, is not prayer properly ſo called: But now we will nothing properly, which we doe not abſolutely will; and therefore we pray for nothing properly, which we doe not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely petition for, although the nature of a condition be often virtual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contained in the diſpoſition of the parties praying, who may be ready to ſubmit their wills unto Gods. Indeed we ſometimes pray that one thing may be done, if another thing come to paſſe; and here we pray, that the futurition of the following thing be conditionall, but the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it ſelfe is abſolute, becauſe we pray abſolutely that one thing doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt upon the poſiture or exiſtence of another. If this which theſe men ſay be true, then Chriſt prayed for the juſtification of all his crucifiers, as a private man, only <hi>improperly,</hi> and not in the <hi>proper and strict accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Prayer; for which improper notion of the word, we have war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from Scripture, when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſſe from me, Non oravit</hi> (ſaith <hi>Becanus) ſed ſimplex naturae deſideri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um propoſuit:</hi> He did not pray but propound the ſimple, bare, and naked
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:56120:294"/>
deſire of his nature: but though this his expreſſion of his naturall deſire and love of life, be not a prayer in regard of either a <hi>criticall or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall</hi> uſe of the Word, yet you ſee, tis agreeable enough unto the language of the holy Ghoſt in ſcripture, to inlarge the ſignification of the Word ſo farre, as to apply it thereunto: for <hi>Mathew</hi> ſaies expreſly that he prayed. <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 39, 42.</p>
                     <p>But here for mine owne part, I muſt freely profeſſe that I better like <hi>Aquinas</hi> his interpretation of the place; that Chriſt prayed not for all his Crucifyers, but only for thoſe of them, that were predeſtinate unto the obtaining of eternall life, by and through him.</p>
                     <p>And of this prayer what a fruitfull and plentifull Harveſt he reaped, you may read in the 2, 3, and 4. Chapters of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles.</hi> There you ſhall read, that the Lord daily added to the Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved; at one time three Thouſand, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time five thouſand; of whom a great and conſiderable number denyed the Holy one and the juſt, and deſired a murtherer to be granted to them, and crucified and killed the Prince of life. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 36. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 14, 15. <hi>Rivet</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. quotes a teſtimony of <hi>Auſtin</hi> favouring this gloſſe: <hi>videbat quoſdam ſuos, inter multos alienos: illis jam petebat veniam, a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus accipiebat injuriam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In making good this to be the ſenſe and meaning of the place, I ſhall proceed by degrees: proving firſt, that it cannot be gathered out of the Text, that Chriſt prayed univerſally for all that crucified him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the contrary may be cleared from the Text, both conſidered in it ſelfe, and compared with other places of Scripture, as alſo by reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That thoſe of his perſecutors for whom he prayed were ſuch as belonged unto the election of grace.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, All the Logick in the World, though racked never ſo much, cannot inferre out of the Text, that Chriſt prayed univerſally for the pardon of all his Crucifyers: for out of an indefinite terme, a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall cannot be concluded, ſaith our Author, in defence of <hi>Moulin</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall that Chriſt prayed for all without exception. <hi>Vindic. l.</hi> 1. <hi>part.</hi> 2. <hi>Digreſ.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 136.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That Chriſt prayed not for all his Crucifiers without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, may be cleared from the Text, both conſidered in it ſelfe, and compared with other places of Scripture, as alſo by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, From the Text conſidered in it ſelfe; <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they doe:</hi> Here <hi>Moulin,</hi> from the reaſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to the Petition, concludes, That he prayed not for all that had a hand in Crucifying him, but only for thoſe who did it out of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; and in all probability ſome of them, eſpecially ſome of the rulers, did it out of pure malice. And whereas <hi>Corvinus</hi> objecteth out of <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 17. againſt <hi>Moulin;</hi> That even the Rulers did it through ignorance: Doctor <hi>Twiſſe</hi> upbraideth him with his unskilfullneſſe in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming conſequences, and making an indefinite propoſition equivalent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an univerſall. It doth not follow, (ſaith he) The Rulers did this through ignorance, therefore all the Rulers did it through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. That ſome did, is certain from that place; and ſo it is,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:56120:295"/>
that ſome of them were converted, and obedient to the Faith <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 7.</p>
                     <p>Beſides he addes, that the Rulers, in all likelyhood, did it out of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ignorance, reſiſting the evidence of the holy Ghoſt, ſpeaking in, and by Chriſt, and bearing witneſſe to the divine Authority of his Doctrine by miracles: Whereas 'tis poſſible that Chriſt might pray for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, that aſſiſted and acted in his crucifying, perhaps not out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, but meerely in the ſimplicity of their hearts, in obedience to their Superiours, not knowing any thing. <hi>Tum vero ad ignorantiam iſtam quod attinet, quam populo Iudaico, &amp; primoribus populi vitio vertit Apoſtolus; quid obſtat, quo minus affectata fuerit in multis, (reſiſtendo ſcilicet evidentiae Spiritus ſancti per Chriſtum loquentis, &amp; per miracula doctrinae ipſius teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium ferentis) praeſertim in primoribus. Qui vero ipſum in crucem egerunt, (pro quibus etiam oravit) erant illi miniſtri, &amp; ſuperiorum mandatis ex of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio inſerviebant: poterat ergo Chriſtus oraſſe pro iis, qui non malitia pulſi, Sed cordis ſimplicitate in Superiorum obſequium ducti Chriſtum in crucem ſuſtulerunt.</hi> He alſo addeth, that he prayed only for them that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at his Death; and 'tis probable that the Rulers, at leaſt ſuch of them as were not afterwards converted, were not preſent at his Death. <hi>Eſto vero, non fuerint converſi, ſed &amp; nihilo minus probabile eſt, primores iſtos non adſtitiſſe preſentes Chriſto, qui crucifixionem ipſius promoverent, pro quibus tamen &amp; ſolis oravit Chriſtus in cruce.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, that Chriſt prayed not for all and every one of his cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyers, D. <hi>Ames</hi> confirmeth, from compariſon of this text with other places of Scripture. <hi>Coron. Art.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>Art.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 5. Amongſt theſe his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies there might be ſome that had committed that great and unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 24, 31, 32. There were ſome, by the confeſsion of <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe, that were finally impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; and finall impenitency in generall, and the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, which formally includes finall impenitency, are ſinnes unto death, for the pardon of which, if knowne, prayer is not lawfull. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 16. And therefore (ſaith <hi>Auſtin)</hi> if Gods Church knew, who were predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to be ſent into eternall fire, with the Divell, and his Angells, they would no more pray for ſuch then they would pray for the Divell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Now Chriſt knew who had committed the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, and who would be finally impenitent; for he himſelfe knew full well what was in man. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 28. Yea he knew from the begining who they were that believed not. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 64. See the Learned and reverend M. <hi>Owen</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>Univerſall Redemption.</hi> p. 44. 45.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that Chriſt prayed not for all his crucifyers, may be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by an argument ſhaped in imitation of that, which Doctor <hi>Twiſſe</hi> urgeth againſt a common and generall interceſsion, which <hi>Corvinus</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeth unto Chriſt. If Chriſt prayed, that all who crucified him ſhould be forgiven, then it was either that they ſhould be forgiven abſolutely or conditionally; not abſolutely, for then all of them were pardoned; if conditionally upon condition, then this condition was either on Gods part, or elſe to be performed on his crucifyers part: it could not be on Gods part, <hi>modo ſcilicet ipſi viſum fuerit,</hi> for then all of them ſhould be pardoned according to your opinion; for you hold, that God truly and unfainedly deſires the ſalvation, and juſtification of all and every one of the Sonnes of Men: If you ſay that 'tis a condition on the part of his crucifyers, why this condition can be nothing elſe but faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:56120:295"/>
and then I demand, whether he prayed for their faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or no? If you anſwer, that he did not pray for the Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of all and every one of them, then ſay I, neither did he pray for their pardon; for he that truly and ſincerely prayeth for any thing, prayeth alſo by juſt &amp; undeniable conſequence for all the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry antecedents and conſequents, cauſes and meanes, fruits and effects thereof: If you hold, that he prayed for the faith and repentance of all and every one of his crucifyers, then the argument may be renewed as in the begining; for I aſke you againe, whether he prayed for their faith and repentance abſolutely or conditionally; if abſolutely, then all and every one of them did believe and repent, which the Remonſtrants themſelves deny: if conditionally, then this condition is either on Gods part, or elſe on the part of the crucifyers of Chriſt; if upon condition on the part of God, it can be nothing but this, if he will or pleaſe, and then all of them ſhould believe and repent, for (as Arminians gloſſe that text 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4) God will have not only all ſorts and kinds of men, but alſo all and every individuall man to be ſaved, and to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth: if it be a condition on the part of thoſe who cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him, then pray doe you aſſigne that condition, and either I ſhall drive you upon the ſame rock of abſurdity, upon which Doctor <hi>Twiſſe</hi> forceth <hi>Corvinus,</hi> to wit, that Chriſt prayed for his Crucifiers, that they ſhould believe and repent, upon condition that they doe believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; or elſe I ſhall renew the argument, ſo as that a progreſſe from one condition to another, and that without end, ſhall be unavoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, that he prayed only for thoſe of his crucifiers, who belonged to the election of grace, is evident from what hath been already ſaid out of D. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> upon <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 9. For thence I have inferr'd, that he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only for his elect as Mediator, that Chapter being the platforme of Chriſts interceſsion, as mediator for his Church: and you affirme it to be improbable, that Chriſt prayed under the notion and capacity of a private man, for any for whom he did not pray as Mediator.</p>
                     <p>But now in the laſt place, let us heare how you expound this prayer of Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>BVT the intent of Chriſts prayer for thoſe that crucifyed him, was not that all their ſinnes ſhould be forgiven them, much leſſe, that ſimply and abſolutely, that is, without any intervening of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, they ſhould be forgiven; (which had been to pray for that which is expreſly contrary to the revealed will of God) but that that particular ſinne of their crucifying him ſhould be forgiven them, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſhould not be imputed unto them by way of barre unto their repentance, either by any ſuddaine or ſpeedy deſtruction, or by delivering them up to ſuch a ſpirit of obſtinacy or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duration, under which men ſeldome or never repent.</p>

                     <p>FIrſt, I ſay of this your comment, as you did of D. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the place, this is ſaid but not proved, Nor indeed probable, becauſe</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Scripture is a ſtranger to this acception of remiſſion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, 'tis very irrationall to take remiſſion in this ſenſe, which by your Doctrine may be conſiſtent with its contrary: to wit condemnation. Though this particular ſinne of their crucifying him, were not imputed to them by way of barre unto their repentance, either by any ſudden or ſpeedy deſtruction, or by delivering them up to ſuch a ſpirit of obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy or obduration, under which men ſeldome or never repent. yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto what you teach of grace, and aſcribe unto the power of mans will, they might notwithſtanding all this not believe and repent, but reſiſt the grace of God, and dye in finall unbeliefe and impenitency, even for this ſinne, and ſo conſequently be condemned for it. Chriſts prayer might be granted, this particular ſinne of their crucifying Chriſt might be forgiven unto them, and yet they might be everlaſtingly dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for it, and their other ſinnes. How you can reconcile theſe things paſſeth my underſtanding, but I ſhall not be unwilling to learne.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, you ſeem to intimate, that ſome ſinnes are ſo foule, as that they are of themſelves a bar to repentance, for the deſert of which God doth ſometimes deny men either time for, or the grace of repentance.</p>
                     <p>And hereby you entrench upon the freeneſſe of Gods grace in mans effectuall vocation, which is the free gift of God, and therefore diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, not according to mens preceding carriages good or bad, but meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the good pleaſure of his will: but this argument I ſhall ſpare farther to proſecute, and referre you to our Doctor, who hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly laboured herein, as in other places, ſo eſpecially in his exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Cotton</hi> his Treatiſe of Predeſtination, <hi>a pag.</hi> 190. <hi>uſque ad</hi> 204. and againe, p. 234, 235. &amp;c. <hi>uſque ad</hi> 246.</p>
                     <p>As for that which followeth, as alſo that which is in the beginning of this Section, the examination of it is beſide my preſent deſigne, which is to vindicate Doctor <hi>Twiſſe</hi> from what you object againſt him.</p>
                     <p>Yet if the Reader deſire ſatisfaction thereabouts, he may meet with it in Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> his <hi>Coronis ad Coll. Hag. Art.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 5. Whither I ſhall in this haſt referre him.</p>
                     <p>And thus have I done with the defence of Doctor <hi>Twiſſe</hi> againſt your oppoſition of him: when I conſider your fluent Wit, and ready Penne, I may expect from you a very ſpeedy reply, Which may be, as ſharpe, ſo ſpecious and Rhetoricall enough. I ſhall deſire this favour of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Reader, that he would ſuſpend his cenſure untill he hath my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder, which I ſhall not deferre long, if God grant me his aſſiſtance.</p>
