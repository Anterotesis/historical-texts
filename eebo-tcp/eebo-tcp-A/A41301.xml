            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Carthage, Arles,</hi> and elſewhere,

the reſtriction to the

Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> being put
in mind by one that in his

Church-men, <hi>Gratus</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of that Sea replies, <hi>quod
in laicis reprehenditur, id multo
magis in clericis oportet prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damnari,</hi>
which plainly ſhews
it not to be condemned as in
its own nature a ſin, for then
the Laity as well as the Prieſt
had been in all times culpable,
but as of that which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
in ſome it might be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
yet was not fitting for
them to exerciſe. And truly
the exceſſes then taken, did
ſo much paſs all proportion

the Fathers to ſpeak with
<pb facs="tcp:40290:7"/>
more earneſtneſs againſt it
than other ſins to which men
were by nature leſs addicted
than that of Covetouſneſs.
And for proof of it, there
needs no other teſtimony than
that of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> whoſe care

may have recourſe to
<note n="s" place="margin">De u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuris, Leg. 26. cod. Juſt.</note> the law it ſelf. It ſufficeth
me, that the Emperour having

of the Authors, who hath always given,

and learned Dr <hi>Andrews</hi> late
Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> I have made choice
of Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi>'s Treatiſe to examine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is the lateſt, and I find little
of any moment but is in him. I deſire
his book may be firſt throughly read, for
otherwiſe, what I write will not ſo eaſily
be underſtood. To give ſome brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
to the Reader of the ſubſtance of
the ſcattered arguments in this Tractate,
he muſt know; That my ſcope and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is to ſhew that <hi>Uſury</hi> is no
where in Scripture forbidden to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
but that it is as lawful as any other
contract or Bargain, unleſs the laws of the
Land do prohibit or moderate it, as a
point of ſtate or policy. And that no State
or common-wealth can or ever did ſtand
without it, or that which in contracts is
equivalent to it, ſince the valuation of
<pb facs="tcp:40290:18"/>
the uſe of money is the foundation and
rule which govern the valuation of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſorts of Bargains. I further main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that <hi>Uſury</hi> was never forbidden to
the Jewes; only by (reaſon that by a
more ſpecial appointment of God they
dwelt in a land in the midſt of many
ſtrangers) <hi>Moſes</hi> made a politick Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
law, that the Jews ſhould take <hi>Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
of thoſe ſtrangers, and not of their
poor brothers, not much unlike, as if the
King ſhould ordain in <hi>London,</hi> That
Citizens ſhould take <hi>Uſury</hi> of men of
<hi>Midleſex,</hi> and not of poor tradeſmen of
the City. More particularly, I undertake
to manifeſt, that the Definitions of <hi>Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
(wherein Dr. <hi>Down</hi> and Dr <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
mainly differ between themſelves)
are neither warrantable by the rules of
art, nor juſtifiable by any proof or ground
in Scripture, or by any teſtimony of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
either in Councels or Fathers. And
that the laws given by God about <hi>Uſury</hi>
are ſuch as by the Coherence of the Texts,
and the conference of other places, do
ſhew that thoſe laws did only intend a
<pb facs="tcp:40290:18"/>
prohibition of taking <hi>Uſury</hi> of ſuch as
borrowed in caſe of extreme neceſſity,
and were ſo poor that they were in Charity
to be relieved. And yet thoſe laws which
did in ſuch caſe only prohibit <hi>Uſury</hi> to
the <hi>Jewes,</hi> were not moral or perpetual,
but Judiciall and temporary, and no way
bind us, but we are left to the laws and
cuſtoms of the Kingdom to guide us in
our Contracts ſo long as they be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the rules of Charity. I ſhew that
all the properties of <hi>Letting</hi> do agree to
money. And that <hi>Uſury</hi> in it ſelf is
neither <hi>unnatural, ungodly, unjuſt,</hi>
or <hi>uncharitable.</hi> Laſtly, I do ſhew that
Dr <hi>Downam,</hi> Dr <hi>Fenton,</hi> and all oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
that do moſt condemn <hi>Uſury,</hi> are
forced to confeſs at laſt that <hi>Uſury</hi> may
be lawful; they all allow the taking of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
Mortgages, Annuities and Leaſes
for yeares, all which by their own expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and confeſſions are of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with <hi>Uſury,</hi> and do only differ in
the manner of the ſecurity or contract: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they have eagerly diſputed that all
Contracts for gain by lending are <hi>Uſuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40290:19"/>
at the end they quietly conclude, that
the Contracts are not <hi>Uſury,</hi> but only the
ſecret intention of the heart makes it to
be <hi>Uſury</hi> or not <hi>Uſury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus in few words they overthrow at
laſt the foundation of their own doctrine,
and play faſt and looſe by a multitude of
their irreſolute diſtinctions, ſo that either
their concluſion muſt be that <hi>Uſury</hi> is
lawful, or elſe they can conclude nothing
at all.</p>
            <p>If I wrong either Dr. <hi>Fenton,</hi> or the
truth, I deſire friendly to be ſhewed my
error. I do not follow him here <hi>Line by
Line,</hi> for ſo I might tire my ſelf, and vex
others with unneceſſary tautologies: I
have only endeavoured to extract the
<hi>quinteſſence</hi> of his reaſons, and to apply
my ſelf to the examination of them. His
Reaſons not his Rhetorick I except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,
whether <hi>Juſtly</hi> or <hi>Unjuſtly</hi> let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
judge, to whoſe Cenſure I ſubmit
theſe Papers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I would fain know of the Miniſters
of the Goſpel, who do often reckon up
in the pulpit</hi> Vſury <hi>as one of the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:40290:19"/>
ſins, what warrant they have in
the Goſpel for ſuch boldneſs:</hi> we
find ſeveral ſins numbred up by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and the Apoſtles, but <hi>Uſury</hi> never ſo
much as named for a ſin in the whole
New Teſtament. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the fift to
the <hi>Galatians,</hi> doth with one breath rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
up together ſeventeen ſins which he
reproves, and yet <hi>Uſury</hi> is none of them.
But many preachers cannot Reckon up ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
deadly ſins except they make <hi>Uſury</hi>
one of them.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Let paſs Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi>'s
Chapter of names of
<hi>Vſury,</hi> becauſe he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
that by them he
hath proved <hi>little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all, Page</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>The main point is the Definition,
which he ſaith muſt not be <hi>omitted, or
ſlightly paſſed</hi> over, becauſe it is a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40290:21"/>
great <hi>and neceſſary queſtion to reſolve
the underſtanding what that Vſury</hi> is,
whereof we diſpute, <hi>pag.</hi> 13. And
therefore he doth intitle his firſt book
wholly about the Definition of <hi>Vſury:</hi>
although when he comes unto the
point, he doth nothing leſs than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
it; As may thus appear: <hi>Actual
Vſury</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>pag</hi> 15. is of divers
<hi>diverſly deſcribed, a variety tedious to
relate.</hi> Firſt, in ſtead of all unlawful
Uſury, he ſpeaks of a deſcription of
part only, to wit of <hi>actual uſury;</hi>
whereas he ſhould firſt define, and
then divide: but inverting the Rule
of method, he ſuffers <hi>mental uſury</hi>
(which he ſaith is a ſin) to eſcape
out of his deſcription.</p>
            <p>Neither doth he ſo much as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<hi>actual uſury,</hi> only he tells us of
diverſity of deſcriptions of others,
but never lets us know which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves.
Yet at laſt he <hi>contracts</hi> the
pith in three words, but reſolves not
how we ſhould place them; ſo leaves
us to a thus, or thus, or thus. Firſt,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40290:21"/>
he puts <hi>Lucre</hi> in the place of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and <hi>Covenant</hi> in the room of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
Secondly he makes <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
the <hi>Genus,</hi> and <hi>Lending</hi> the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
and laſtly he puts <hi>Lending</hi>
for a <hi>Genus,</hi> and <hi>Lucre</hi> for a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
Thus by turning the <hi>Genus</hi> into
the difference, and the difference
into the <hi>Genus,</hi> he leaves us uncertain
of his deſcription, yet concludes that
within the <hi>compaſs of three words we
may find Vſury;</hi> but who knows not
that three words diverſly placed breed
many times different, and ſome times
contrary ſenſes. Yet this is all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
you are like to find in him.
And thus in few lines he paſſeth over
<hi>ſlightly that neceſſary queſtion</hi> which
would reſolve our underſtanding <hi>what
Vſury is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us draw a little cloſer, and
examine the pith of theſe three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
cited by Dr. <hi>Fenton,</hi> and
contracted in three words.</p>
            <q>Pactum ex mutuo Lucrum.</q>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:40290:22"/>Uſury is <list>
                  <item>Lucre for Lone upon Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;

                  <item>Lending upon Covenant for
Lucre.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. Whereas he ſaith <hi>Vſury</hi> is <hi>Lucre,</hi>
he ſeems to make <hi>Lucre</hi> or Gain to be
the <hi>Genus</hi> of <hi>Vſury.</hi> This undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
is a falſe <hi>Genus;</hi> For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Vſury</hi> is a ſin of Commiſſion, and
therefore an <hi>action</hi> of <hi>operation;</hi> ſo that
<hi>Lucre,</hi> or gain which is only a <hi>paſſion</hi>
or <hi>product</hi> of Lending, cannot be the
<hi>Genus</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>2. He maketh <hi>Covenant</hi> to be the
<hi>Genus;</hi> Let me ask him but this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;
A Father to ſtir up only, and
trie the induſtry of his Son, doth lend
him an hundred pound with a <hi>peira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical</hi>
covenant for <hi>Gain,</hi> not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with himſelf to take any intereſt
at all of his Son; Doth any man take
this to be <hi>Vſury</hi> in the Father, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
meant to take the leaſt increaſe
from his Son? Surely then the bare
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40290:22"/>
Covenant cannot be the ſin of <hi>Vſury</hi>
in this caſe.</p>
            <p>3. He ſaith, <hi>Vſury is lending upon Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
for Lucre.</hi> In this deſcription,
asalſo in the two former, I find a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
contradiction of his own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Grounds. <hi>To lend for gain is
no lending at all; for Lending</hi> (ſaith
he, <hi>pag.</hi> 16.) <hi>in its own proper nature
is free; Letting is for hire or gain.</hi> So
that by this his Doctrine, <hi>Lending</hi> for
gain is no lending at all, but letting
or hiring out. Therefore if Dr. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
had been true to his own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
he ſhould have defined <hi>Vſury</hi> to
have been <hi>Letting upon Covenant for
Lucre;</hi> or in brief, Letting or Hiring
of Money, But both Dr <hi>Fenton,</hi> and
all other <hi>Antidaeniſts</hi> cannot endure
to have <hi>Vſury</hi> called Letting or hiring
of money.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I find in theſe three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
that he imagineth the Gain
or Lucre is for the <hi>bare act of Lending;</hi>
In which he is much miſtaken: It is
not for the lending, but for the <hi>uſing</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:40290:23"/>
of the thing lent that men give <hi>Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi>
and anſwerable to the time for
which Money is let, the increaſe or
<hi>Vſury</hi> is more or leſs, although the
ſimple act of Lending be alike in
both. The ordinary word <hi>Vſury</hi>
(which Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> derives from <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
rei,</hi> the uſe of the thing) teacheth,
even children, that uſury is given for
the Uſe of the thing, and not for the
bare Lending,</p>
            <p>Again, in theſe his three deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the word <hi>Covenant</hi> is perpetually
found, without any warrant of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
Yet he pretends by <hi>deduction</hi> to
fetch it out of the Text in <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.
25. <hi>Thou ſhalt not be as an Vſurer unto
him, thou ſhalt not oppreſs with Vſury.</hi>
In the Original it is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not
exact,</hi> and, <hi>thou ſhalt not impoſe Vſury.</hi>
From whence Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> concludes,
that there can be no exaction or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
upon a free perſon, but by
way of <hi>Covenant. pag.</hi> 26. Under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
this his inference is falſe; for
exaction may be of things neither
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40290:23"/>
covenanted for, nor due. In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of our common Law, and of
our vulgar phraſe, <hi>Extortion,</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action</hi>
are thus diſtinguiſhed, <hi>Extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
is a wrong in taking more than is
due, <hi>Exaction</hi> is the taking of that
which is <hi>not due at all:</hi> Which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
were falſe, if that Exaction muſt
be by precedent contract. The poor
Jews did ordinarily borrow victuals,
money, and other neceſſaries upon
Pawns, as may appear by many Texts.
The Lender, who did take the pledge
as a caution for his Principal, might
detain it from the poor Borrower un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
he would allow ſome gain above
the Principall, and by ſuch unjuſt
means <hi>exact</hi> or <hi>impoſe</hi> an unconſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
increaſe, without any precedent
Covenant.</p>
            <p>There is ſmall reaſon to imagine,
that ſuch indigent people (as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by <hi>Moſes</hi>) who borrowed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſupply a preſent want, ſhould
have credit ſufficient to take up ſo
large a ſum for ſo long a time as might
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40290:24"/>
deſerve an Obligation or Covenant
for the payment of encreaſe. A man
who could not have his Bond taken,
might yet have his Garment received
for a Pledge; and Pledges were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
given with intention of ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
redemption, becauſe raiment is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
as neceſſary as food. The bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing
in this kind being of things
of ſo ſmall value (that the uſe of them
for a ſmall ſeaſon was hardly valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
might be a great reaſon of the
prohibition of <hi>Vſury</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> in
ſuch caſes: Neither is a man that lends
upon Pawns in the like hazard with
him that takes Bonds, or ſuch ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
            <p>It is the confeſſion of Dr. <hi>Fenton,</hi>
that <hi>When the Law againſt Vſury was
given, there was none that borrowed but
only the poor for need, and upon neceſſity.</hi>
Therefore without better warrant by
direct and literal proof from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it cannot be evinced that this
word (<hi>Covenant</hi>) muſt neceſſarily be
required in the definition or deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40290:24"/>
of Uſury, although Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi>
conclude, <hi>it is no Vſury except it be by
Covenant,</hi> or by ſome dumb Contract
at the leaſt.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> omits this word Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
in his definition of <hi>Vſury.</hi> I
am ſtrongly perſwaded by a place in
<hi>Nehemiah,</hi> to think that <hi>Vſury</hi> doth
not conſiſt in <hi>contracting</hi> for gain. I
find in the ſixth Chapter, a grievous
oppreſſion deſcribed; <hi>A great cry of
the people againſt their Brethren the Jews,
they were forced to take up Corn for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
their ſons and daughters, upon
mortgage of their lands, vineyards, and
houſes, they ſold their children for bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves.</hi>
Theſe were men oppreſt by
Contracts, and were to pay twelve
in the hundred, as appeareth by the
eleventh verſe. And yet for all this,
there are ſuch paſſages and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the text as move me to think
that this Oppreſſion was not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Uſury.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> never calls it <hi>Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
but only a <hi>Burthen;</hi> neither the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40290:25"/>
word <hi>Neſhec,</hi> nor <hi>Tarbith,</hi> nor <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith</hi>
is to be found in this Chapter, and
yet theſe are the only words in the
Law to expreſs <hi>Vſury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> never tels the
the Nobles and the Rulers, that they
had broken the Law againſt Uſury.
Any man would think, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
and reclaim men from their ſin,
the way had been to have named it in
particular, or the Law by which it
was prohibited: but <hi>Nehemiah</hi> doth
neither of theſe, he only tells them, <hi>it
was not good what they did,</hi> and askes
them <hi>if they ought not to walk in the fear
of their God, becauſe of the reproach of the
heathen their enemies;</hi> not becauſe of
a particular Law againſt <hi>Vſury,</hi> but
for that the nane of God ſhould not
be blaſphemed by the heathens, when
they ſaw how miſerably the Jews did
oppreſs one another.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> tells the Nobles,
<hi>that he and his ſervants might have
exacted as well as the other Nobles:</hi>
Whereas if this exacting had been <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:40290:25"/>
he could not juſtly ſay, that <hi>he
might have exacted,</hi> for it had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Law.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> doth not threaten
to puniſh them as he was a Magiſtrate,
but entreateth them by his <hi>charitable</hi>
example to leave off their exacting
that <hi>Burthen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then <hi>Nehemiah</hi> never naming <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,</hi>
nor mentioning the Law againſt
it, but ſuppoſing the act of the Nobles
to be lawful, but not expedient, doth
encline my belief to think, that this
Oppreſſion was not properly <hi>Vſury,</hi>
although it had a Covenant for gain.</p>
            <p>And one reaſon why this was not
<hi>Vſury</hi> might be, becauſe the people
were not primarily ſuch poor neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
brethren as are deſcribed in the
firrſt Laws againſt <hi>Vſury:</hi> For though
theſe fell into want, yet at the firſt
they had <hi>lands, houſes, vineyards,</hi> and
<hi>olive-grounds,</hi> for which they were to
pay unto the King a yearly Tribute.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon that avails with me
to perſwade that all contracts for gain
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40290:26"/>
are not prohibited as <hi>uſurious,</hi> is the
teſtimony of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 23.
who mentions a Bank of <hi>Vſury</hi> in the
Jewiſh Common-wealth, out of which
a man by delivering in his money,
might at length receive his own with
<hi>Vſury.</hi> Although our Saviour do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhew diſlike nor approbation of
ſuch a Bank, yet for it to be within
any City of the Common wealth of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> without the ordinance, or at
leaſt allowance of the Prince or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
is a thing moſt improbable.
And almoſt as unlikely that the State
ſhould tolerate ſuch a Bank if all <hi>Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
were of it ſelf unlawful, and alſo ſo
pernicious to the Common-wealth by
the oppreſſion of it as Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.</p>
            <p>I find many reproofs in the Goſpel
of the falſe gloſſes and interpretations
of the Scribes and Phariſees, whereby
they perverted the Law in many
things; but I find not any rebuke of
the Magiſtrates for this of <hi>Vſury;</hi> if
it had been ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> violation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40290:26"/>
of the Law, it could not have been
forgotten by our Saviour Chriſt and
all his Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>But to what purpoſe it is to diſpute
about the terms of the deſcription of
<hi>Vſury?</hi> or what ſort of Contract it is?
when it appears plainly in Dr. <hi>Fenton,</hi>
that not only the Covenant of lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but alſo (in his opinion) <hi>buying,
ſelling, letting, exchanging,</hi> and the
reſt, may be all Contracts of <hi>Vſury.</hi>
To give an inſtance, theſe are his
words, <hi>pag. 21. With a hundred pound
I purchaſe an annuity of twenty pound</hi>
per annum <hi>for ten yeares: this is Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
and Sale, differing in the manner
of the Covenant, yet is it the ſame thing
in truth with Vſury.</hi> And ſo in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place (<hi>pag.</hi> 129.) he ſaith the
like. I muſt ſay this is an expreſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
to affirm that purchaſing is
<hi>buying, and another manner of Covenant
differing from Lending,</hi> and yet to ſay
<hi>in truth it is the ſame with Vſury,</hi> which
he ſaith is <hi>Lending,</hi> this is to make
buying and lending all one. And to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40290:27"/>
confound all Contracts.</p>
            <p>As the term of <hi>Covenant</hi> is not to be
found within the Texts againſt <hi>Vſury,</hi>
ſo in the Fathers of the Church there
is no mention of it; they abuſe us
therefore, who pretend the conſent
of the Primitive Church for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
of all <hi>Contracts</hi> of gain for
the uſe of money. The truth is, the
<hi>Canoniſts</hi> and <hi>School-men</hi> were the
firſt broachers of theſe deſcriptions of
<hi>Vſury</hi> which are now preſſed upon us
by ſome few Modern Divines. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
was more modeſt and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of the phraſe of <hi>Scipture,</hi> which
doth deliver the Laws againſt <hi>Vſury</hi>
in ſuch reſtrained terms as are by a
juſt conſtruction appliable properly to
the Rules of Charity and Equity, for
the relief of the poor only.</p>
            <p>From the Canon-Lawyers (who
are the Popes learned Counſell in the
Law) hath Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> borrowed not
only his deſcriptions, but alſo his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and diſtinctions at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
or third hand: For he takes all
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40290:27"/>
from Dr. <hi>Downam,</hi> Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> from
<hi>Melancthon</hi> and <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> and theſe
two fetch it from <hi>Canoniſts, Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts,</hi>
and <hi>School-men.</hi> And although Dr.
<hi>Fenton</hi> be free from the ſin of <hi>Vſury</hi>
by borrowing freely his whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
from Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the intereſt of one new Argument
or Reaſon: Yet if Dr <hi>Fenton</hi> did not
Contract with Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> for the
borrowing of the Treatiſe, he is little
leſs than a Plagiary, and if we take
this word in as large ſignification as
they doe the word <hi>Vſury,</hi> it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that though Dr <hi>Fenton</hi> be not
guilty of paying Uſury, yet he hath
offended againſt another Law in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.
21. 16 Deut.</hi> 24. 7. which is the
greater ſin; for although the Law of
God appoints no puniſhment for an
<hi>Vſurer,</hi> yet a <hi>Plagiary</hi> was to be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed
by death.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40290:28"/>
I find mention of them in ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
places of my Author, I will reſerve
them a while, and firſt handle the
Texts of <hi>Scripture</hi> that are moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
in this controverſie.</p>
            <p>Three texts onely are to be found
in the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> about <hi>Vſury.</hi> In
the two firſt the poor is moſt expreſly
named, and in the third neceſſarily
implied. <hi>Exod. 22. 25. If thou lend
to my people the poor with thee, thou ſhalt
not be as an Vſurer unto him. Thou,
ſhalt not oppreſs with Vſury,</hi> Levit. 25.
35. <hi>If thy brother be impoveriſhed or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into decay with thee, thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him—take thou no Vſury of
him or increaſe—thou ſhalt not give
him thy money upon Vſury, nor lend him
thy victualls for increaſe.</hi> By theſe two
texts we have an exact deſcription of
the poor, who muſt be one impover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed
and fallen into decay, one whoſe
hand (as the text is) is weakened and
ſhaketh that he cannot labour, one
whom thou haſt need to receive and
relieve, and one who is forced to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40290:28"/>
victuals for neceſſity. The third
text though it doth not expreſly name
the poor; yet that it hath reference
only to ſuch is moſt probable. Firſt,
becauſe as in the former text in <hi>Levit.</hi>
where the poor are deſcribed, and one
of their properties mentioned to be
borrowing of <hi>Victuals,</hi> ſo in <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 19.
where the name of poor is omitted,
yet the property of borrowing food is
ſet down, which to be the Cuſtome
only of the poor in extreme neceſſity,
common experience doth daily teach
us. Secondly, the law here doth only
uſe the word of <hi>biting</hi> or <hi>Neſcher,</hi> which
word is alſo onely uſed in the firſt
text, where the poor is named. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if we will allow (as all men do,
and as we needs muſt) this law in
<hi>Deut.</hi> to be the ſame with that in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi>
and <hi>Levit.</hi> then it muſt have the
ſame <hi>object</hi> the poor, and the ſame <hi>end,</hi>
which is the relief of the ſame poor,
for we find no other reaſon or end al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged
in Scripture for the prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Vſury,</hi> but that the <hi>poor brother
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40290:29"/>
may live with thee and have ſufficient for
his need.</hi> God where he tyes men to
lend, he provides and binds them to
lend freely. The law is, <hi>if there be
among you a poor man of one of thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
thou ſhalt not harden thy heart,
nor ſhut thy hand from thy poor brother,
but thou ſhalt open thy hand wide unto
him, and ſhalt ſurely lend him ſufficient
for his need in which he wanteth. Deut.</hi>
15. 7, 8. For the obſervation of this
law God was careful that this lending
ſhould be without <hi>Vſury:</hi> He makes
no law to bind men to lend unto the
Rich, and therefore there is no law to
reſtrain taking <hi>Vſury</hi> of them: The
lending to the poor was to be ſo free
that it muſt be in the next degree to
giving, and we find that to this law
that commanded <hi>Lending,</hi> is added in
the very next verſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely
give him, and thy heart ſhall not be griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when thou giveſt unto him.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. it is ſaid, <hi>thou ſhalt
relieve him,</hi> and then it followes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<hi>take no Vſury of him.</hi> Thus the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40290:29"/>
Scripture doth couple the work of
<hi>Charity</hi> with the prohibition of <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,</hi>
to teach, that they are both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
about one and the ſame <hi>object.</hi>
Therefore he that ſhall make the Rich
alſo the object of this law in <hi>Deut.</hi> he
muſt of neceſſity invent ſome new
<hi>End</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of it more than the
Scripture doth afford, and alſo make
the laws themſelves to differ; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
a true reaſon why the law in <hi>Deut.</hi>
is in ſo ſhort termes, may be for that
the law having been twice before
more particularly ſet down, <hi>Moſes</hi>
doth in <hi>Deut.</hi> only repeat it in brief
and few words, as being ſufficient to
call it to their remembrance, now
they were ready to enter into the
land of promiſe. If we conſider alſo
the unmercifulneſs of the Jews a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelves, it was high time
to make proviſion for the poor, they
would not ſtick it ſeems to ſtrip a
poor man ſtark naked for a debt, as
appears by the law concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of pledges before ſun-ſet if
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40290:30"/>
they were <hi>the covering only</hi> and <hi>ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the skin</hi> wherein <hi>a man might
ſleep, Exod.</hi> 22. 26. Beſides, they would
ſorbear to lend to the poor becauſe
they were in danger to loſe their debt
if they did not recover it before the
ſeventh year. The law is <hi>Deut. 15. 1. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſeventh year,</hi> every <hi>creditor that
lendeth ought unto his neighbour ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
it,—that which is thine with thy
brother thy hand ſhall releaſe.</hi> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing
of debts had the ſame end
with the prohibition of <hi>Vſury,</hi> the
relief of the poor; and although this
law of releaſing be delivered in the
general terms <hi>of neighbour</hi> and <hi>brother,</hi>
yet they muſt be underſtood only
of the poor brother, as it is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
by the exception following in
the fourth verſe, which ſaith this releaſe
muſt not be <hi>ſave where there ſhall be
no poor among you:</hi> and in the 11. verſe,
after the releaſing of debts, and the
lending to the poor enjoyned, the
concluſion is, <hi>for the poor ſhall never
ceaſe out of the Land, therefore lend to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40290:30"/>
thy Brother, to thy poor, and to thy nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in the Land.</hi> Theſe places do teach
us that this word <hi>Brother</hi> is ſometimes
in a ſpecial ſenſe uſed for the <hi>Poor.</hi>
This law of releaſing made men afraid
to lend, and therefore God warnes
them in the ninth verſe, <hi>Beware that
there be not a thought in thy wicked (or
Belial) heart Saying, the Seventh year,
the year of releaſe is at hand, and thy
eye be evil againſt thy poor Brother, and
thou giveſt him nought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſince the law of God which
prohibiteth uſury only in three places,
hath in the two firſt expreſly named
the poor, and deſcribed them, and in
the third cleerly intimated them, By
what reaſon, Conſcience, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
can any man extend thoſe lawes
to all men in general, which the Holy
Ghoſt hath ſo carefully reſtrained to
the poor? And ſince the Law firſt given
againſt <hi>Vſury</hi> doth mention oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the poor, I wonder Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi>
would not fetch his definition from
the text, and call <hi>Vſury</hi> oppreſſive
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40290:31"/>
lending to the poor: but never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
oppreſſion of the poor, he calls
it a <hi>Covenant of gain for lending;</hi> which
is quite beſide the text, which ſeemes
only to forbid <hi>Vſury</hi> to ſuch as ſtand
in need to be relieved by our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</p>
            <p>And for this cauſe I do conjecture
<hi>Calvin</hi> did ſay, <hi>that unto him it did not
appear by any teſtimony of Scripture that
all Vſury is altogether condemned,</hi> and
it is conceived that one reaſon why
the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> doth appoint no kind
of <hi>Judicial</hi> puniſhment for <hi>Vſury,</hi>
might be, becauſe the ſin is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
only by the judgment of a
mans own Conſcience, and not by any
precedent contract for gain.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe texts in the <hi>Pſalms,
Proverbs</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> their general
words cannot make any new law,
but their rebukes and exhortations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And even <hi>Ezekiel</hi> who moſt declaims
againſt <hi>Vſury, Ezek.</hi> 18. 17. joynes it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40290:31"/>
with making the poor <hi>Sorrowful, not
giving bread to the hungry, and not Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the naked.</hi> Nor can theſe texts be
any expoſition of the laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Vſury,</hi> becauſe the laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are expreſſed and explained in

            <head>3 Of the names of Vſury</head>
            <p>I know the adverſaries to all <hi>Vſury</hi>
do much triumph in their Origination
of the Hebrew term for <hi>Vſury;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is derived from a root that

that Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> doth confeſs that
<hi>names have been no definitions,</hi> and
therefore are not demonſtrative argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in any queſtion. Secondly, I
do acknowledge that the Original
word <hi>Neſhec</hi> might well denote ſome
malignant quality in <hi>Vſury,</hi> and I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40290:32"/>
conceive a true reaſon of it might be,
for that the firſt kind of borrowing
which was in the world, or at the time
when the law againſt <hi>Vſury</hi> was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
was in Caſe only of neceſſity, and
to ask an overplus in ſuch Caſes was
a ſin that well deſerved the worſt
name. We all know that Riches of
mony and many other goods were
brought into the world by degrees,
as arts and trades were multiplied by
the induſtry and wit of man. State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
buildings, rich furniture, gorgeous
apparel, and dainty feaſts were not
prepared againſt the Creation of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am;
It was a long time before ſo much
ſilver was digged up and Coined as
would fill mens Coffers that they
might ſpare or employ large ſums by
the negotiations and traffique of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
men firſt looked after things
neceſſary only, and the want of ſuch
things taught them to borrow of one
another</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alſo when the law was given, the</hi>
People of God (<hi>ſaith Dr.</hi> Fenton <hi>p.</hi> 10.)
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40290:32"/>
were travelling in the deſert, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
being troubled with wars in the
Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> there was little borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of money, but only by the Poor for
the Supply of their want, and of them to
take Vſury was more ſenſible biting, and
oppreſſion, in that they borrowed not to
lay out for Commodities, but to ſpend for
neceſſity. Therefore <hi>David</hi> in his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
dayes uſed the word Neſhec only
for Vſury, as beſt fitting thoſe times where
the pooreſt were moſt bitten by this ſin.</p>
            <p>In theſe paſſages of Dr. <hi>Fenton,</hi> we
may note, what manner of borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Cauſed the firſt name of <hi>Vſury,</hi>
which name afterwards for the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
only of the increaſe might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to all other ſorts of borrowing,
although they were not of the ſame
uncharitable nature. The like obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of a good name uſed for a bad
thing Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> produceth in the
Latin name of <hi>Vſury.</hi> Uſura (ſaith
he) <hi>was originally a good honeſt word,
until Vſury did marre it. For</hi> Uſura
<hi>in truth is nothing but</hi> uſus rei, <hi>primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40290:33"/>
taken for the uſe of other things as
well as money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In concluſion, although the uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
gain that was practiſed upon
neceſſitated borrowers did juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
a befitting name of <hi>biting,</hi> yet a
Gain that is taken from ſuch as borrow
where neceſſity conſtraineth not, is
but an <hi>equivocal biting,</hi> Becauſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
there can be no biting but where
there is <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> and oppreſſion is
only of the poor. A man may deceive
a Rich man, but oppreſs him he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
the reaſon is evident, <hi>oppreſſion is a
Violent action of Injuſtice,</hi> neceſſity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
a poor man to borrow, and the
lender forceth him to pay an increaſe,
in this is a violence which a rich man
cannot be ſubject unto, becauſe no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
forceth him to borrow, it is
not neceſſary but arbitrary whether
he will borrow upon increaſe: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there be a moral neceſſity
that if he will borrow he muſt pay an
overplus, yet that he muſt borrow is
not abſolutely neceſſary; ſo then it is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40290:33"/>
the neceſſity of the borrower that
muſt concur to make a violent action
in the lender</p>
            <p>If a rich man be forced to pay the
whole forfeiture of a bond, it was his
own folly to enter into ſuch an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
without neceſſity, whereby he
doth enable the lender to deceive him
by a legal meanes, who in extremity
makes benefit of all that which the
law did provide only for a caution
of his indemnity: This deceit of the
lender is injuſtice, but it is not the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
ſin of oppreſſion which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
found in <hi>Biting Vſury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond word there is found in
Scripture which they ſay is an <hi>Exege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
addition, which ſignifieth <hi>any
increaſe at all.</hi> If what were ſaid were
true, it neither hurts nor helps the
queſtion if the text be underſtood of
the poor only, for although all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
from the poor, yet what is that
to the taking <hi>Vſury</hi> of the Rich? But
let us ſee a little how they reſtrain
this word [<hi>tarbith</hi>] for <hi>increaſe,</hi> firſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40290:34"/>
if <hi>tarbith</hi> do ſignifie of it ſelf a <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying,</hi>
as it doth indeed, or an exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
increaſe, it is then all one with
<hi>Neſhec,</hi> which Dr <hi>Fenton</hi> makes to
conſiſt in the quantity of the gain, but
I think to be in the quality of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
from whom it is taken, and then
where will they find their <hi>exegeſis</hi> if
theſe terms be <hi>Synonymaes.</hi> Secondly,
I would know how Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> can
prove that the Scripture uſeth <hi>tarbith
for the Vſury of mony: The Prophets</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>who be true expoſitors of the
law, joyn both words together, applying
them both indifferently evermore to one
and the ſame thing.</hi> It is true that the
Prophet <hi>Ezek.</hi> joynes <hi>Neſhec</hi> and <hi>tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith,</hi>
and ſo doth <hi>Solomon;</hi> but it is
falſe that they apply them both indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
<hi>evermore</hi> to one and the <hi>ſame
thing,</hi> for they apply them not at all,
they neither name mony nor <hi>victuals;</hi>
I can find them but once applied in
the whole Scripture, and that is by
<hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 36, there Dr. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
might have found them both nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40290:34"/>
together, and then applied, <hi>Neſhec</hi>
to mony, and <hi>tarbith</hi> to <hi>victuals,</hi> ſo that
the law of God no where in plain
termes forbids the increaſe of <hi>Mony:</hi>
which point is carefully obſerved by
the tranſlators of our Bible; for they
all conſent and agree to tranſlate <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhec</hi>
only for <hi>Vſury:</hi> the words <hi>tarbith</hi>
or <hi>marbith</hi> they have never tranſlated
by the name of <hi>Vſury.</hi> And in the
<hi>Proverbs</hi> 28. 8. whereas in the <hi>Original</hi>
it is <hi>tarbith,</hi> our Divines have rendred
it <hi>Vnjuſt gain,</hi> thereby intimating
they did not think all <hi>increaſe</hi> or gain
to be meant, but only ſuch as was
unjuſt.</p>
            <p>It will be ſaid, that ſince <hi>Mony</hi> and
<hi>Victuals</hi> are both in the ſame text, they
are both of one <hi>nature,</hi> ſo that <hi>tarbith</hi>
may be referred indifferently to either
of them. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The text doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
them, not for being of one nature
in ſpending or uſing, but the law did
intend only the mention of ſuch things
as the poor in extremity do neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
borrow for maintenance of life,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40290:35"/>
which is either victuals it ſelf, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
which doth eaſilieſt and ſooneſt
procure victuals: Otherwiſe theſe two
differ as Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> hath ſhewed in
the example of a loaf and mony, the
firſt is ſpent, the latter is uſed: victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
then when they are ſpent or quite
conſumed, and no further uſe can be
made of them, it is otherwiſe with
mony which cannot properly be ſaid
to be ſpent; the ſame 100 <hi>l.</hi> that hath
been uſed by one, may be uſed after
by a 100 men ſucceſſively: and in the
paſſing of it away ſome other Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
may be procured by it of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or equal value, which may be uſed
for increaſe; ſo that the uſe of money
is in aſort <hi>Perpetual.</hi> This difference
well conſidered, there might be a
greater reaſon to prohibit the <hi>uſury</hi>
and increaſe of <hi>Victuals,</hi> than <hi>Vſury</hi>
only of mony: But I do not rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the argument from the names of
<hi>Neſhec</hi> or <hi>tarbith,</hi> and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I think the true propriety of
them (as of many other words) is
quite loſt as to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:40290:35"/>
A third ſtrain of Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> is to
have the word <hi>tarbith</hi> to expound and
explain the term <hi>Neſhec:</hi> we find <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhec</hi>
uſed alone in <hi>Exod. Deut.</hi> and the
<hi>Pſalmes: tarbith</hi> is never uſed alone,
but is joyned with <hi>Neſhec</hi> in <hi>Levit.
Prov.</hi> and <hi>Ezek:</hi> ſo then the firſt is
uſed in all texts, the latter but in ſome.
Now the queſtion is, whether a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
word which is always uſed
ſhall expound a general which is uſed
but ſometimes; or on the contrary as
Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> thinks, for he telleth us
<hi>p.</hi> 39. it is the manner of <hi>Scripture after
a law is given and a ſin forbidden in a
ſenſible term, by the addition of a more
general to expreſs Gods meaning more
fully, leſt men ſhould ſeek liberty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining
the former termes more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly;</hi>
thus he, but what ſenſe is
there in his words <hi>to expreſs a ſenſible by
a general?</hi> he ſhould have ſaid <hi>a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
by a <hi>general,</hi> or a <hi>ſenſible</hi> by an
<hi>inſenſible,</hi> and then his error would
have been more ſenſible; for I truſt
it is the nature of things ſenſible to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:40290:36"/>
things inſenſible, and of <hi>particulars</hi>
to expound <hi>generals,</hi> as may manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear by the inſtance alleged by
Dr. <hi>Fenton,</hi> and which makes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſtrongly againſt himſelf. <hi>Theft</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>is ſet down in the Senſible term
of ſtealing, the Holy Ghoſt addeth deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
falſely or Circumventing, teaching
thereby over-reaching in bargaining by
Cunning to be theft.</hi> Here I ask if <hi>Steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
be a ſenſible term, whether <hi>deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
falſely or circumventing by cunning</hi>
be a <hi>General,</hi> ſurely Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> muſt
not ſay it, for deceit in contracts is
but a particular kind of theft or ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and therefore not a more but a
leſs general term than <hi>ſtealing:</hi> ſo that
quite contrary to Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
the general ſin of ſtealing is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
&amp; expreſſed by the particular
ſin of deceit in dealing, therefore it is
more reaſonable that the particular
term of <hi>biting</hi> ſhould expound the
meaning of the general word <hi>encreaſe,</hi>
ſince nothing is more uſual than when
a matter hath been particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40290:36"/>
to mention it afterwards in
more general termes.</p>
            <p>Beſides this ſhift of expreſſing the
<hi>Senſible</hi> by the more general term, is
to imagine the wiſdom of God <hi>ſubject</hi>
to humane infirmitie, as if God had not
been able to perfect his law <hi>till the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
of men, and their Seeking liberty to
reſtrain the termes</hi> taught him how to
mend it. No doubt if the law of God
had intended the prohibition of all
increaſe, it could have done it in plain
and ſhort termes (as it doth in <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Theft,</hi> and <hi>Adultery</hi>) by ſaying
thou ſhalt take <hi>no increaſe by lending
or letting mony,</hi> but inſtead of increaſe
the Law ſaith <hi>biting or oppreſſing of the
poor;</hi> if Murther and <hi>Vſury</hi> were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
and permitted alike, why doth
not the Commandement ſay, <hi>thou ſhalt
not murther thy poor brother, but a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
thou mayeſt murther?</hi> Surely God
doth not uſe theſe qualifications for
nought. It is demanded by Dr. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
upon the law <hi>thou ſhalt not trouble
any widow or fatherleſs Child,</hi> whether
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40290:37"/>
it follow that I may trouble a married
woman or a child that hath a father?
<hi>Anſw.</hi> I may not. But yet the reaſon
is not for that I am prohibited by this
ſpecial law for Widowes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans,
but for that by a general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of <hi>not ſtealing</hi> I am forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to oppreſs or trouble any man:
The like may be ſaid of the words of
<hi>Solomon, Thou ſhalt not rob the poor,</hi> yet
I may not rob the rich, though theſe
words forbid me not; but becauſe of
the former general Commandement.
But the like cannot be ſaid of <hi>Vſury,</hi>
there being no former general law
that forbids taking <hi>increaſe of the
rich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> ſaith that <hi>Vſury</hi>
bites the rich as well as the poor, and
doth promiſe to prove it, but it ſeems
he forgat it, I am in doubt he is never
able to do it. Indeed he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
us that to lend to the Rich is
to enable him to oppreſs the Common-wealth
and ſo conſequently the poor:
But he doth not ſhew how the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40290:37"/>
can be wronged by <hi>Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and yet no particular perſon be
firſt oppreſſed; ſure I am the text
ſpeaks not of oppreſſing the Common-wealth,
but expreſly names particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thy poor brother to whom thou
lendeſt that he be not oppreſſed. So
that the law points at an apparent
and ſenſible perſon whom <hi>Vſury</hi>
bites.</p>
            <p>But Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> comes and tells us
<hi>p. 36, Alas good ſimple widows! can
they tell when, or whom, or how many
their Vſury doth bite? nay can the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Vſurer of them all tell?</hi> Thus Dr.
<hi>Fenton</hi> becauſe he ſees that in ſome
caſes he cannot ſhew how any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
perſon is oppreſſed by <hi>Vſury,</hi>
therefore he flies for Sanctuary to the
Common-wealth, to hide himſelf in the
croud, whileſt he muſt confeſs he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell who is oppreſſed, but yet the
Common-wealth or ſome body in it
(God knows who) is oppreſſed.</p>
            <p>But let us ſee how he knowes in
general that the Common-wealth is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40290:38"/>
by <hi>Vſury,</hi> Forſooth he ſaith, it
makes <hi>things dearer</hi> and <hi>enhaunces</hi> the
prices of the <hi>Mercat.</hi> p. 36. <hi>Anſ.</hi> the
dearneſs of things is cauſed either by
the ſcarcity of the things themſelves,
or by the plenty of mony. As for the
ſcarcity of Commodities it cannot be
cauſed by <hi>Vſury,</hi> for it neither eats
up corn nor cattel, nor weares out
apparel, nor deſtroyes the native com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
of any Country. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
merchants and others (who by
<hi>Vſury</hi> are inabled to trade) do export
ſuch things as are cheaper and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller
here than in other Countries,
that ſo they may gain <hi>there:</hi> and do
bring back ſuch things as are deareſt
and of moſt neceſſity at home, that ſo
alſo they may gain <hi>here.</hi> So that <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury</hi>
doth not only not cauſe a ſcarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but it is the meanes of plenty in
a kingdom, for as it Conſumes not that
we have, ſo it procures us that we
want. As for dearneſs by reaſon of
plenty of mony, it is no miſery but
the happineſs of any Realm to know
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40290:38"/>
ſuch a dearth: thoſe places are not the
Richeſt where things are cheapeſt, for
then <hi>Scotland</hi> would excell <hi>England,</hi>
but it is the want of mony which makes
things cheap in ſuch Countries: Nor
let any man think that if <hi>Vſury</hi> were
not, things would be one whit cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
for by Dr. <hi>Fenton's</hi> confeſſion, p.
38. if <hi>Vſury were not, men would ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their wits either in trading themſelves
or imploying others,</hi> ſo that the ſame gain
would be raiſed an other way; for in
the point of <hi>Vſury</hi> the queſtion is not
whether gaines may be made of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but who ſhall have the gains.</p>
            <p>As for raiſing the mercat it is not
cauſed by <hi>Vſury,</hi> the Governours and
Rulers of the Rates and Prices of all
things are the owners of mony and
maſters of ſtocks, for the <hi>Lenders</hi> rule
the <hi>Borrowers,</hi> and the richer govern
the meaner. The monyed men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
the valuation of goods, and
by practice and cuſtom agree in a
common gain to be raiſed by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
of bargaining, ſelling, letting
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40290:39"/>
and the like. For inſtance, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of mony of this kingdom by their
trading raiſe ſo much gaines as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
amounts to 20. or 30. in the
100 at the yeares end; which being
conſidered by the meaner ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
they reckon with themſelves, that
if they can borrow at 10 in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
that then by ſuch trading their
gaines may both pay the uſe and
leave them 20 or 10 <hi>l.</hi> gainers: ſo that
the borrowers do trade by buying
and ſelling in the Mercat at the ſame
prices that the owners of money do,
and it is the rates of the Mercat that
rules their uſing, and not their <hi>Vſury</hi>
the Mercat: The difference is onely
that the owners prove the greater
gainers and grow richer than the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers
who keep but part of their
gettings, becauſe that their ſtocks are
not their own: And queſtionleſs the
Common eſtimation of men would
not valew at 8. or 10 in the hundred
if it did not ordinarily produce a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
increaſe both for borrower and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40290:39"/>
lender. If any man object that the
prime gain which comes by buying
and ſelling, and leads the rate of <hi>Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
is too great, I know no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
but this, if Common cuſtom may
not determine reaſonable gaines, I
know not how it will be reſolved,
ſince there is no rule in Scripture for
it: but that men may grow rich by
gain I find both practiſed and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by <hi>Scripture,</hi> neither are men
reſtrained from gaining more by trade
than is ſimply neceſſary for life and
being.</p>
            <p>If Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> and thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
all <hi>Vſury</hi> had been ſo obſervant
of the letter or literal ſenſe of the
Laws as they do pretend, they would
never have troubled themſelves ſo
much about Contracts which are not
named in the Law: but would rather
have Concluded that the very <hi>taking
of Vſury or increaſe</hi> (though it be not
contracted for) is utterly <hi>unlawful</hi> by
the law in <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 36. where it is
ſaid, <hi>Take thou no Vſury of him.</hi> How
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40290:40"/>
then can theſe men juſtifie the <hi>Taking</hi>
of their <hi>foenus liberale,</hi> which they
commend, or the <hi>foenus nauticum,</hi>
which they allow, <hi>or the Contractus So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietatis,</hi>
or <hi>partnerſhip,</hi> which they ſo
much extol, ſince all theſe are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forbidden by the <hi>Law, If to take
increaſe be unlawful?</hi> To the Jews
themſelves the letter of the Law did
ſeem to condemn the <hi>taking of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity,</hi>
nay, ſome of them did think it
<hi>Vſury</hi> if a man did but ſalute or bid
good morrow to him that had lent
him mony, if he did not uſe to do ſo
before he borrowed it; becauſe in the
Original it is ſaid, thou <hi>ſhalt take no
Vſury of any word, Deut.</hi> 23. our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
hath it, <hi>Vſury of anything:</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch ſaluations were not contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for, nor were of any valuable price,
or mony worth.</p>
            <p>I do not find any text brought
by Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> out of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt <hi>Vſury;</hi> for the truth is,
there is none, although Dr. <hi>Downam</hi>
and ſome others do cite two texts, firſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40290:40"/>
               <hi>Mat. 5. 42. Give to him that asketh;
and from him that would borrow of thee
turn not away.</hi> If we ask Dr. <hi>Dow
nam</hi> whether every one be bound to
lend to every one that asketh, his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
is, <hi>Reſpect is to be had of thine abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and of his neceſſity, and alſo (if it be
not a Caſe of urgent and preſent neceſſity)
of his honeſty: if his neceſſity urge him
to borrow, and thine eſtate enable thee to
lend, thou art bound to lend unto him,
eſpecially if his honeſty deſerve to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected,
Lect. on the 15. Pſalm. pag.</hi>
224. Why may not the ſame reſpects
be obſerved in the interpretations of
all texts againſt <hi>Vſury?</hi> Secondly he
cites <hi>Luke. 6. 35 Lend, looking for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
thence.</hi> Laſtly both he and Dr.
<hi>Fenton</hi> do apply all texts that do men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
lending freely, or charitableneſs
to the poor, or mercifulneſs to our
neighbour, as heaps of ſo many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
againſt <hi>Vſury,</hi> although the name
be not ſo much as to be found in the
whole New teſtament as Condemned.
For my part I do gladly hear all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40290:41"/>
to <hi>Charity,</hi> and think them
more than needful; and if any man
be ſo great an <hi>Vſurer</hi> as that he make
himſelf thereby unable to be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the poor, ſuch a man may be
juſtly condemned, and I ſhall never
defend him: But to conclude, becauſe
a man muſt give to the poor, therefore
he may not let to the rich, is no good
conſequence, The text that bids me
lend freely, doth not thereby forbid
<hi>not to let at all,</hi> but that upon ſeveral
occaſions and according to divers Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
I may do either; if the
Commanding to obſerve one ſort of
Contract were the Prohibiting of all
other kinds, it would follow that I
might neither give mony to the poor,
nor fell victuals to the rich, becauſe
I am Commanded to lend both.</p>
            <p>But let us admit that both in the
Old and New teſtament the laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Vſury</hi> had been <hi>Moral</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in as general terms as can be
deviſed: Be there not many laws and
texts which muſt of neceſſity be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40290:41"/>
otherwiſe than the bare letter
ſounds, and according to ſuch a ſenſe
as may ſtand with natural reaſon, ſo
that it contradict not any other plain
or neceſſary doctrine, nor overthrow
the <hi>analogie</hi> of Faith? There is a law
of our <hi>Saviour Chriſt</hi> that ſaith, <hi>ſwear
not at all,</hi> and again he ſaith, <hi>to him that
asketh, Give;</hi> Neither of theſe Laws
muſt be literally underſtood, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
according to the rule of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
reaſon,</hi> and diſcretion. <hi>Chriſt</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
<hi>his Diciples to carry gold, or
ſilver, or any manner of coin in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi>
I do not think that Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi>
and others have followed the letter
of this law, but I truſt they will grant
an interpretation over and beſides the
bare letter. There be divers ſuch
texts, as, <hi>if thy eye offend thee, pull it
out; pray continually; if any ſue thee for
thy Coat, let him have thy Cloak alſo:</hi> all
which if they were not otherwiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
than the bare words do
bear, would bring great confuſion
with them, and ſuch inconvenience
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40290:42"/>
as no reaſon nor law could or might
allow in any caſe. The light of <hi>Nature</hi>
muſt help to guide us in the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of many texts. It is Dr. <hi>Fentons</hi>
own confeſſion <hi>p.</hi> 34. that <hi>Vſury</hi> is a
<hi>Queſtion of that nature, as is not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable
by the law of God in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but alſo by the law of Nature, thoſe
Maximes and Principles of Common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
which are written in the hearts of
men by the finger of God;</hi> which point
had need be well conſidered, becauſe
as Mr. <hi>Hooker ſaith, a number there are
who think they cannot admire as they
ought the Power and Authority of the
word of God, if in things divine they
ſhould attribute any force to mans reaſon,
for which Cauſe they never uſe reaſon ſo

<hi>Nor let any man think</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the judgment of Natural diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we can have no aſſurance to pleaſe God;
for to the Author and God of Nature how
ſhall any operation proceeding in natural
ſort, be in that reſpect unacceptable? the
nature which himſelf hath given to work
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40290:42"/>
by, he cannot but be delighted with, when
we exerciſe the ſame any way without
Commandement of his to the Contrary. p.</hi>
60. Now if any place in the Bible may
receive an interpretation from the
rules and principles of natural reaſon,
why might not the texts of <hi>Vſury?</hi>
ſince it is converſant altogether about
<hi>Covenants</hi> and <hi>Contracts</hi> which are
grounded only upon the laws of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and <hi>Nations:</hi> and many Caſes
there be which are confeſſed by all to
be no apparent breaches of Charity,
nor any injuſtice found in them; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> is brought
thereby to ſuch a ſtraight as he is forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to maintain <hi>that there be other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
which makes uſury unlawful beſides
the hurt of our neighbour p.</hi> 44. and 125.
But if <hi>Charity</hi> be the <hi>fulfilling of the
whole law,</hi> I will give them leave to
talk their fill, yet I cannot beleeve
how <hi>Vſury</hi> can be a ſin if it hurt not
my neighbour. Their pretences of the
oppreſſion of the Common-wealth by
taking <hi>Vſury</hi> of the Rich is but a meer
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40290:43"/>
               <hi>Sanctuary of ignorance,</hi> and a fiction
which can never be proved, ſince it is

               <head>Whether the law of Vſury be

               <p>To prove the laws againſt <hi>Vſury</hi> to
be <hi>Moral</hi> and not <hi>Judicial</hi> D. <hi>Downam</hi>
produceth a main argument which is
not in Dr. <hi>Fenton,</hi> his words are, <hi>The
law which commandeth free lending is
not Judicial, but Moral; for the ſame law
which commandeth the affirmative for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
the Negative. Anſw. 1. Dr. Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi>
miſtakes in thinking <hi>free lending
and lending for gain</hi> to be termes of
<hi>affirmation and negation: Lending and
not lending</hi> which are Contradictorily
oppoſed are only <hi>Affirmative and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
terms; Lending freely or for gain</hi>
are only ſeveral ſorts of lending, and
differing in qualities, and though
their qualities differ yet they are both
poſitive and affirmative, for it is an ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iome
<hi>Contrariorum utrumque membrum
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40290:43"/>
eſt poſitivum,</hi> In Contradictions and
Privations, one term is always nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
but it is not ſo in Contraries. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
let me retort Dr. <hi>Downams</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
in a ſtronger Caſe. <hi>The law
which commandeth reſting on the Sabbath
is not Judiciall but Moral, therefore the
law which forbiddeth Kindling a fire on
the Sabbath day is Moral,</hi> for the law
which Commandeth the <hi>affirmative,</hi>
forbiddeth the <hi>negative,:</hi> what will
Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> anſwer to this his own
argument? here is affirmation and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
<hi>Reſting and not Reſting</hi> in the
kindling of a fire, not Contraries only
but Contradictories, yet I preſume Dr.
<hi>Downam</hi> will not conclude that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
a fire on the Sabbath day is a
breach of the <hi>Moral law.</hi> Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi>
is of opinion <hi>that if God doth forbid
biting and oppreſſing Vſury only by his
law, that then the law muſt needs be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and not Judicial,</hi> except we will
give <hi>liberty to Chriſtians to oppreſs and
bite their Brethren.</hi> pag. 44. The anſwer
is, <hi>The Equity of the law is ſtill in force, the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40290:44"/>
Rigor of it is abrogated;</hi> or thus, <hi>that the
poor ſhould not be oppreſſed is Moral, that
they ſhould not be oppreſsed by Vſury is
Judicial.</hi> To make the meaning of
this diſtinction clear, we muſt know
that all <hi>Judicial laws</hi> were made for
that hedging in or encloſing of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
law, and whereas the Morall law
was delivered either in <hi>General affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative</hi>
commandements, or negative
prohibitions, the <hi>Judiciall</hi> comes after
and gives ſome particular politick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
in the obſervation of them;
for example, the Moral law ſaith in
general <hi>thou ſhalt Sanctifie the Sabbath,</hi>
then comes the <hi>Judicial</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Ye
ſhall kindle no fire throughout your ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations
upon the Sabbath day, Exod.</hi> 35.
3. ſo the Moral law tells us <hi>thou ſhalt
not ſteal,</hi> the Judicial adds, <hi>if a man
ſteal an oxe, or a ſheep, he ſhould pay five
or four fold for it,</hi> and in moſt caſes but
double, <hi>Exod</hi> 22. 1. 4. So then there
is a general equity in all Judicials
which is Moral and eternal. There
is a law <hi>Levit. 25. 23. the land ſhall not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40290:44"/>
be ſold for ever:</hi> whereby ſelling of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
is forbidden, and this law
did bind <hi>Naboth 1 Kings</hi> 21. 3. that
he would not ſell his inheritance to
king <hi>Ahab.</hi> The equity of this law
which binds all men, even infidels, to
preſerve or procure an inheritance or
eſtate for their poſterity, remaines ſtill
in force; yet abſolutely, not to ſell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
land is eſteemed no otherwiſe than
a Judicial law fitted for the Common-wealth
of the Jews: ſo the perpetual
equity of <hi>Sanctifying the Sabbath,</hi> and
<hi>of not Stealing</hi> abides, although the
kindling of a fire on that day is now
arbitrary; and the Compenſation of
ſtealing is left to the poſitive laws of
each nation. The ſame law that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
us to <hi>ſteal,</hi> bids us to relieve the
poor, and ſo doth the equity of the
law of <hi>Vſury.</hi> It is ſufficient that the
general equity of this law be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the poor relieved, but that
in particular they muſt be relieved by
the not taking <hi>Vſury</hi> of them is not
neceſſary. It was a ſin in any <hi>Jew</hi> to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40290:45"/>
take <hi>Vſury</hi> of his poor, although he
did relieve him otherways, becauſe
God did reſtrain him to that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
manner of relieving the poor. But
with us it is otherwiſe; if by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes we do ſufficiently relieve
the poor, then even the taking of <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury</hi>
of them is no ſin nor oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Judicials of <hi>Moſes</hi>
we muſt alſo obſerve, that they were
not ſo particular, but that many
things were left to the Ordinance of
the Magiſtrate or high Prieſt, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ordinances (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> doth
obſerve) <hi>are many times preſuppoſed as
grounds in the ſtatutes of God, Deut.</hi>
24. 10, There is a Judicial Law which
ordereth only the manner how a
pledge muſt be taken; this neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doth preſuppoſe ſome former hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
law that did order that pledges
might be taken. Even that ill law
or Cuſtome of <hi>divorce, Deut.</hi> 24. 1. is
regulated by a Judicial law, that it
might thereby be made leſs hurtful.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40290:45"/>
The reaſon why I note theſe things is,
becauſe the law of God concerning
<hi>Vſury</hi> did preſuppoſe and was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on a former law or cuſtom of the
<hi>Jews</hi> which was then in uſe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
And the ſpeciall caution for the
Poor might leave the Rich to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
and laws of the Magiſtrates
which did always regulate all ſorts of
contracts. And wheras the law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
did allow <hi>Vſury</hi> only to <hi>Strangers;</hi>
It doth not follow but that others that
were neither <hi>Poor</hi> nor <hi>Strangers</hi> were
left to the ordinary laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
No Magiſtrate could give a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
for <hi>Vſury</hi> towards the <hi>Poor,</hi>
nor a <hi>Prohibition</hi> for it towards <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:</hi>
ſo much as God ordered no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
laws might alter; as for other
caſes not ſpecified, they were left to
the ordinary policy of the State. For
we muſt not think that God provided
all the civil laws of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> His eſpecial
care was to ordain laws for the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of ſuch ſins as had been learnt
by his people of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40290:46"/>
the prevention of ſuch as might be
taught them by the <hi>Canaanites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know that Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> doth inferre
that the law which prohibits <hi>Vſury</hi> is
<hi>Moral,</hi> pag. 45. becauſe the allowance
of it to ſtrangers is only a Judicial, for
unleſs it had been a ſin, what needs a
toleration: ſince lawful things have
no need of a permiſſion? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If
the allowing of <hi>Vſury</hi> to ſtrangers be
no Law at all but only an Exception
or <hi>proviſo</hi> annexed to a former law,
then it can be no Judicial; all laws
do Command or forbid ſomething, but
this if it be an exception doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe it leaves the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
as it is the nature of all ſuch
proviſoes in ſtatutes. But if they will
have it to be a Law, then it muſt bind
affirmatively, and not only that one
May but that one Muſt take <hi>Vſury</hi>
of a ſtranger, for in the Original it is
<hi>thou ſhalt lend upon</hi> Uſury <hi>or ſhalt cauſe
to bite;</hi> And the Hebrews underſtand
this to be a <hi>Commandement</hi> and not a
<hi>Permiſſion</hi> only.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:40290:46"/>
Secondly, whereas they Compare
the allowance of <hi>Vſury</hi> to the <hi>permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
of <hi>Divorce,</hi> they erre notoriouſly:
for the difference between <hi>allowing</hi>
and <hi>permitting</hi> is moſt manifeſt, as Dr.
<hi>Downam</hi> confeſſeth <hi>pag.</hi> 298. We al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
thoſe things only which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to be good, or at leaſt indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:
But we permit only ſuch things
as are eſteemed evill. God hath ſaid
by <hi>Moſes</hi> thou <hi>mayſt</hi> or <hi>thou ſhalt take
Vſury</hi> of a ſtranger, he never ſaith <hi>thou
mayſt divorce thy wife if ſhe diſpleaſe thee,
or thou ſhalt put her away.</hi> But the law
is, <hi>If ſhe do diſpleaſe thee, and find no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in thine eyes, and if thou ſhalt put
her away, and if ſhe do marry another,
and if he alſo put her away, Then</hi> (ſaith
the law) <hi>her firſt husband may not take
her again. Deut.</hi> 24. 1. 2, 3, 4. ſo that
the end of the whole law of divorce is
only to keep the woman from return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her firſt huſband after a ſecond
marriage; all that goeth before is but
by way of ſuppoſition: But if any man
will contend that the <hi>writing of a bill
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40290:47"/>
of divorce</hi> is enjoyned in the law, it
muſt follow that it is not a Permiſſion
but a Command, contrary to our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours</hi>
doctrine who calls it a Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 8. And if it be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
we muſt needs underſtand it as
<hi>an order only how and after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
the divorce ſhould be,</hi> to wit <hi>by bill
in writing:</hi> but not as an order that
did command men ſimply to be divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
It is very little leſs than blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to ſay that <hi>Moſes</hi> law ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
any thing that was evil. It is the
power of the law-giver to make both
the <hi>Rule</hi> and the <hi>Exception</hi> to it. It is an
over-bold ſpeech of Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> to ſay,
that notwithſtanding <hi>Moſes law</hi> had
given liberty to the <hi>Jews</hi> to take <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury</hi>
of ſtrangers, yet it was a ſin to do
it, and that they <hi>could not be abſolved
in the Court of Conſcience,</hi> although
they might be <hi>abſolved in the external
Court,</hi> pag. 45.</p>
               <p>Whereas Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> doth pretend
that a <hi>Reaſon</hi> that moved God to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
this ſin of <hi>Vſury</hi> to ſtrangers, was
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40290:47"/>
to <hi>prevent the greater oppreſſion of his
own People,</hi> and that the <hi>hardneſs of the
Jewiſh hearts</hi> was ſuch <hi>that if they might
not have taken Vſury of ſtrangers they
would have made a Prey of their own
Brethren.</hi> ib. <hi>Anſw.</hi> How much doth
this derogate from the laws of God?
as if they were not able to bridle one
ſin but by the toleration of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and if the hardneſs of mens
hearts muſt be born with, ſince mens
hearts are as much hardned in other
ſins as in <hi>Vſury,</hi> why are not ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſins tolerated as well as <hi>Vſury?</hi>
ſurely the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> was as
great as their <hi>Vſury,</hi> and <hi>their hearts
went a whoring after ſtrange Gods,</hi> yet
Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> cannot ſhew that any <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi>
was permited them in any kind.</p>
               <p>I find ſome <hi>Criticiſm</hi> uſed by Dr.
<hi>Downam;</hi> upon the Hebrew names in
Scripture which ſignifie a <hi>ſtranger,</hi> pag.
208. but I cannot find that Dr. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
doth make any uſe, the three ſorts
of <hi>Ger, Taſhab,</hi> and <hi>Nocre</hi> (which he
tranſlates to be <hi>Advena, Inquilinus,</hi> and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40290:48"/>
                  <hi>Hoſtis</hi>) are inſiſted upon by him. He
would have <hi>Nocre</hi> to ſignifie an alien
by <hi>birth, Religion, affection,</hi> and <hi>Dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
This diſtinction he labours not
to prove, neither do I think it ſound,
becauſe I am informed by thoſe that
are skilful in the tongues that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
<hi>root</hi> doth ſignifie to be <hi>ignorant</hi>
or not to <hi>know,</hi> ſo that whoſoever was
unknown, was <hi>Nocre,</hi> a ſtranger, though
he were not of another nation, if he
were but only of <hi>an unknown</hi> family;
the word is uſed by <hi>Solomon Pro.</hi> 5.
20. and 6. 24. where he calls a <hi>Whore
a ſtrange woman,</hi> no man muſt think
that he meanes ſuch <hi>whores</hi> only as are
of another <hi>nation</hi> or <hi>religion,</hi> but all
ſuch as were not to be known to them
as wives; So God forbids the <hi>Jews
Deut. 17. 15. that they ſhould not ſet a
ſtranger to be King over them:</hi> ſurely he
meant ſuch ſtrangers as dwelt amongſt
them, there was little danger that they
would chooſe an Enemy that dwelt
in another Country. I find in <hi>Levit.</hi>
22. 10. it is ſaid, <hi>there ſhall no ſtranger
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40290:48"/>
eat of the holy thing,</hi> that is, whoſoever
is not of the Prieſts family; ſo that
the word <hi>ſtranger</hi> may ſometimes ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> of another family or
tribe.</p>
               <p>D. <hi>Downam</hi> affirms that a <hi>Jew</hi> was
permitted to take <hi>Vſury</hi> of ſuch ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
only as were enemies and aliens
both in affection and religion, birth
and habitation: ſo that if a ſtranger did
but dwell or converſe amongſt the
<hi>Jews,</hi> they might not take <hi>Vſury</hi> of
him. But Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that a <hi>Brother</hi> and a <hi>Stranger</hi> in
the <hi>Levitical</hi> law are <hi>Membra dividen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
he that is not a brother is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and <hi>è contra, &amp;c.</hi> Now a brother <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi>
25. 42. is only <hi>an Iſraelite circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
brought out of Egypt,</hi> If therefore
the law had prohibited only the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Vſury</hi> of an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only the taking of it of an <hi>enemy
ſtranger,</hi> then the law had been very
imperfect and defective, becauſe there
had been no direction in the law for
ſuch ſtrangers as had been ſojourners
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40290:49"/>
or proſelytes, who are neither <hi>Brethren</hi>
nor <hi>Enemies;</hi> if any man think that a
<hi>proſelyte</hi> or <hi>ſojourner</hi> might be accompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Brother let him but read <hi>Levit.
25. verſe</hi> 39, 40, 42, 44, 45, and
46.</p>
               <p>I know Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> p. 46. would
have us think that a <hi>Jew</hi> might take
<hi>Vſury</hi> of a ſtranger, becauſe he might
alſo kill him: But I muſt deny that
any private man might kill a ſtranger
but in a publick warre; neither can
the like text be ſhewed for the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the murther of a ſtranger by a
private man. Many places there be in
which the <hi>Jews</hi> were enjoyned to be
Charitable to ſtrangers, <hi>Thou ſhalt not
vex a ſtranger,</hi> Exod. 22. 21. <hi>Love ye
the ſtranger, for ye were ſtrangers in the
land of Egypt,</hi> Deut. 10. 19. <hi>Thou ſhalt
not oppreſs a ſtranger, for ye know the
heart of a ſtranger, becauſe ye were ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
in the land of Egypt,</hi> Exod, 23. 9.
There was in many Caſes the ſelf ſame
Charity to be ſhewed to the ſtranger
as to the poor; The corners of the <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt</hi>-field,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40290:49"/>
the <hi>gleanings</hi> of it, and the
<hi>ſingle grapes, Thou ſhalt leave for the poor
and the ſtranger,</hi> Levit, 19. 9. Alſo
the <hi>third yeares tyth, the forgotten
ſheafs, the feaſts of Pentecoſt, and of
Tabernacles,</hi> were appointed for the
relief and benefit of the <hi>ſtranger, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs</hi>
and the <hi>widow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are many more laws to be
found in the book of <hi>Moſes</hi> which are
made for the benefit of the poor; the
equity of them certainly continues
unto this day; but no man but a <hi>Jew</hi>
is ſo mad as to ſay the rigorous obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of them is to be required of us;
why then muſt they law againſt <hi>Vſury</hi>
more than all the reſt be neceſſary?
It may as well be affirmed that all the
<hi>Judicial</hi> laws are <hi>Moral;</hi> let them
ſhew us by what rules they do diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
theſe laws: I do apprehend that
the <hi>Judicials</hi> were converſant about
the morality of outward actions, as
about the diſtinctions of <hi>rights,</hi> the
diſtributions of <hi>inheritance,</hi> the Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment
of <hi>crimes, as of Blaſphemy,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40290:50"/>
Perjury, Murther, Adultery, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter,
Fornication,</hi> or the like, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the rites of Marriage, of Divorces,
of Bondage, of Vſury, of Witneſſes,</hi> and
of many other actions, the equity of
all which is reducible to ſome one
Commandment or other of the <hi>Moral</hi>
law.</p>
               <p>If all the Levitical laws be read over,
it cannot be found that ever any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
was delivered with ſuch reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
qualifications, and diminiſhing
termes, as the law of <hi>Vſury: thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
thy poor brother, thy poor brother
that is with thee;</hi> the general name of
neighbour is not ſo much as uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it: it is no where ſaid <hi>thou ſhalt
take no Vſury of thy neighbour.</hi> Beſides,
this law hath an allowance which no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Judicial hath. And laſtly, this law of
<hi>Vſury</hi> taken in the ſenſe of our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
(for all increaſe from the rich
alſo) can be no breach of <hi>Charity</hi> in
ſome Caſes, and then there will be no
Equity in it, which is found even in
all <hi>Judicials.</hi> Indeed I find Dr. <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:40290:50"/>
brought to ſuch ſtraights as to
maintain that there be other <hi>reſpects
which make Vſury unlawful beſides the
hurt of the neighbour, pag.</hi> 295. But if it
be forbidden by the <hi>Moral law,</hi> and
that law be a branch of the ſecond ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(as Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> affirms) how it
can be a ſin without breach of <hi>Charity</hi>
to the neighbour, paſſeth my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
ſince Charity is the fulfilling
of the law.</p>
               <p>Whereas Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<hi>Vſury to an officious lye,</hi> which is
a ſin, though it hurt not but help the
neighbour, <hi>pag.</hi> 277. It is true an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
lye is a ſin: but a ſin againſt
the firſt Commandement of the firſt
Table as it is repugnant to <hi>Truth</hi>
which is an eſſential Attribute of
God: Every one that lyeth doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
deny and forſake the true God.
Let Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> tell us, which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of the firſt Table is by <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury</hi>
violated. It is not ſufficient to
ſay, that all <hi>Vſury</hi> is a breach of our
allegiance to God, this is but begging
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40290:51"/>
of the queſtion, unleſs this diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
can be referred to ſome particular
precept of the Decalogue, as the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
lye is to be firſt; as for general
diſobedience, it is a ſin that goeth
through all the Commandement, and
is to be referred to each particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
according to the ſeveral objects
of it.</p>
               <p>It is further inſiſted on, that the
prohibition of <hi>Vſury</hi> is coupled in
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> 18. with ſins againſt the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
law, from thence an inference is
made that it ſelf muſt be Moral.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If we look upon other
Scriptures we ſhall find Judicials and
Morals mingled together in the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Law: We may ſee in <hi>Levit.</hi>
19. 9. the prohibition of <hi>Reaping</hi> the
corners of the field, and gleaning the
Vineyards, which were Judicials, ſet
immediately before the forbidding of
Stealing, Lying, and Swearing, which
are parcels of the Moral Law. In the
13. verſe of the ſame Chapter it is
ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not defraud thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40290:51"/>
nor rob him: The wages of him
that is hired ſhall not abide with thee all
night untill the morning.</hi> The former
of theſe is Moral, the latter is Judicial.
And alſo in the 16. verſe, the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Enchantment,</hi> or Witchcraft, is
ſet between the forbidding of <hi>eating
bloud,</hi> and <hi>rounding the corners of the
head,</hi> and <hi>marring the corners of the
beard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Whereas Dr. <hi>Downam
ſaith</hi> pag 219. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt deciphers
a wicked man, that ſhould dye the death
if he did any of theſe things:</hi> We find
firſt that the words in the Orginal are,
<hi>if he do like to any one of theſe things;</hi>
or as our new Tranſlation hath it in
the Margent, <hi>or that doth to his brother
beſides any of theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whereas Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
theſe ſins by the disjumctive <hi>Or,</hi>
our new tranſlators uſe the Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>And,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, To confound Dr. <hi>Downam</hi>'s
opinion, the Text in the 13. verſe
ſaith, <hi>He hath done all theſe abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40290:52"/>
he ſhall ſurely dye.</hi> And good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
for ſome of the crimes were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
and <hi>Adultery,</hi> but <hi>Vſury,</hi> or the
taking and keeping of a Pledge hath
no kind of Puniſhment appointed by
<hi>Moſes,</hi> neither hath any man denied,
but that the law of reſtoring the
pledge was Judicial, and not Moral.</p>
               <p>But let it be granted to Dr. <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi>
(that which he can never prove)
that death is threatned by <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to
Uſury; May it not ſtill be a Judicial
Law for all that? Was not the Law
in <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 1. a Judicial, whereby
it is ordered <hi>that an Hebrew-bond-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
ſhould at ſeven years end be free
and at liberty?</hi> Yet God doth threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the People for breaking this Law,
by reaſſuming their ſervants <hi>with a
liberty to the Sword, to the Peſtilence,
and to the Famine,</hi> Jerem. 34. 17.
Alſo in <hi>Numb. 15. 35. the man that
gathered ſticks on the Sabbath day was
ſtoned by Gods appointment,</hi> and yet the
Law was but Judicial, and not Moral.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:40290:52"/>
Before I conclude this queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the nature of the Law againſt
<hi>Uſury,</hi> it is not impertinent to remove
a ſcruple that is objected. It may be
asked of me that maintain there is no
Law in Scripture now in force againſt
<hi>Uſury,</hi> what Text can be ſhewed that
it is lawful?</p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>There needeth none; for if
the Law of God do not now forbid
it, it is ſufficient that the Law of</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Reaſon, <hi>and</hi> Cuſtom <hi>doth make it
lawful.</hi> About things eaſie and manifeſt
(<hi>ſaith Mr.</hi> Hooker) by common ſenſe,
there needeth no higher conſultation—the
means of ſome things is ſuch, that
to ſearch the Scripture of God for the
ordering of them, were to derogate from
the reverend authority, and dignity of
the Scripture.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould ask Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> what
Text he hath to prove that <hi>Letting</hi> of
Land is lawful, it would ask him ſome
time to find it; or how he can war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
the ſelling of Land, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
forbidden in the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40290:53"/>
23. It may be I can alledge as good a
Text for Uſury. I think the 6th of
<hi>Luke</hi> which is alleged againſt it may
with better reaſon be produced for
it, and if we will ſtand to the literal
and common ſenſe of the word in the
Original, we may conclude that it is
not only allowed, but commanded
there; what exceptions can be taken if
a man ſhould tranſlate <gap reason="foreign">

Lord in this place did conſider what doth
many times hinder men from lending
their mony to their poor brethren (to wit
the fear leſt they loſe what they lend to the
poor) and therefore he would remove that
fear from us, and bring us to this paſs, that
as often as we help our neighbour for Gods
ſake, we ſhould never think that it may be

            <head>4. Of the Properties of Letting.</head>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> and Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure to hear that <hi>Vſury</hi> ſhould
be called <hi>Letting of mony.</hi> Many are
the properties that are (as they think)
<hi>inſeparable</hi> from <hi>Letting,</hi> and cannot
be found in the putting out of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
<hi>Hiring or Letting</hi> (ſay they) <hi>is
of ſuch things as are not ſpent in the uſe,
but have a fruitful uſe in themſelves na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally;
which uſe may be valued apart
and be let, the property remaining in the
Letter, and the thing if it miſcarry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the fault of the hirer belongeth to the
Letter only.</hi> If we ask from whence
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40290:54"/>
they collect theſe diſtinctions and
properties of Letting, or whether
they have any rule for them in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
They anſwer, though there be
no Text for them, yet the Law of
Nature and Reaſon which ordereth
and regulateth all humane contracts,
doth teach them. Let it be ſo: And
let us have leave a little to examine
by the ſame Law of Reaſon and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſenſe theſe properties of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and ſee whether any or all of
them may be applied to money.</p>
            <p>I confeſs things hired are not to be
ſpent in their uſe. Neither is money
properly ſaid to be ſpent in the uſe, it
is not to ſpeak like a Grammarian, to
ſay any thing is ſpent in the uſe,
for <hi>ſpending</hi> and <hi>uſing</hi> are in propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of ſpeech diſtinct actions, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
by reaſon of ſome ſimilitude
between them they be uſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly
by the vulgar phraſe. A
thing uſed doth remain the ſame
after the uſe to be uſed again; but a
thing ſpent periſheth or is conſumed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40290:55"/>
in the ſpending, ſo that no further uſe
can be made of it. Mony is not thus
ſpent, at the moſt it is but ſaid to be
ſpent to him that hath made no profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
uſe of it, in it ſelf it remaines <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent</hi>
and <hi>uſeful</hi> to others. Thus much
Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> ſaw very well, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he doth not urge this property
as Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> doth, but ſeems to
yield, and ſay <hi>pag. 65. That alſo of
ſpending mony in the firſt uſe, as if the
uſe and property were inſeparable, ſo ſtood
upon by School Divines</hi> (he might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
have ſaid <hi>Canoniſts) is much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to cavil, for there is ſenſible dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between ſpending a loaf of bread,
and disburſing mony for gain—a
loaf once eaten hath no ſecond uſe to him
that eat it, or to any other: mony laid
out remaineth ſtill the ſame to be uſed by
another; and the ſame in the Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to him that laid it out: and the
ſame individual peices which once deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhall never happily return again to the
ſame perſon; there may be ſome differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in a Philoſophers brain, but not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40290:55"/>
in a merchants purſe, it is all one whether
it be the ſame ſhilling or another as good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Things let</hi> (ſay they) <hi>muſt have a
fruitful uſe naturally in themſelves.</hi> If
this property were true, I would
confeſs money might not be Let.
But common ſenſe doth confute this
aſſertion. What fruitful uſe hath
a houſe naturally? doth one houſe
beget or bring forth another? is it
not an artificial thing, as tools, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
and furniture? all which
are lawfully Let, although they
have no more fruitful uſe by nature
than money hath. All things that are
uſeful either by <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Art,</hi> that
have either <hi>fructum</hi> in themſelves, or
<hi>queſtum</hi> by induſtry, are the object of
<hi>Letting:</hi> no man will deny the artificial
uſe of mony, yet I find Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> to
contradict himſelf in this point of the
uſe of mony, his words are, <hi>p. 20. The
monies of a Tradeſman be his tools by which
he getteth his living: if therefore they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
from him to his ſenſible detriment,
ſatisfaction is due in juſtice &amp; equity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40290:56"/>
touch of Vſury,</hi> In an other place
(<hi>pag.</hi> 94.) forgetting this he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
that <hi>Nothing whatſoever it be, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
or artiſicial, but it ſerveth either to
feed, or to cloath, or to work withal, or to
play withal, yet for mony there is no uſe
to be made of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mony have thus <hi>an artificial uſe</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from the ſpending of it, this uſe
of it is valuable apart, and to be guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the ſame rule which ſerves for
the true valuation of any other Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
thing: we ſee by daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that the valuation of the uſe of
mony is more certain than of other
things. It remaines then, <hi>that Money
hath an artificial uſe which is valuable,
and in that reſpect may be let as other
artificial things are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To proceed. Another property (ſay
they <hi>pag.</hi> 16.) of <hi>Letting is, that the uſe
only is paſſed over, the property reſting in
the Lender. Whereas Lending paſſeth
over the property with the uſe for the time
it is Lent.</hi> Is this true? Then a man
had need take heed of Lending, If
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40290:56"/>
when he lends he loſeth the property
of the thing lent: Surely I ſhould
think that <hi>the uſe</hi> and <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> only
(and not the property) is paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
in Lending and Letting alſo. He
that hath Lent his mony during the
time that it is Lent &amp; out of poſſeſſion,
hath power in law and a right to give
or bequeath at his pleaſure, that which
he could not diſpoſe of, if he had no
property in it. A property in the ſum
Lent, or to the equivalent, which is
all one, as Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> hath ingenuouſly
confeſſed. It is a frivolous exception
to ſay he hath not a property in that
<hi>Individual</hi> ſhilling which he lent, ſince
art hath ſo ordered it that all ſhillings
are the ſelf ſame in uſe, and as one
ſhilling. If all other natural and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
things, which are confeſſed to
be Lettable, were of equal value and
uſe; if all horſes and ſheep were alike
in all things without any real diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in their goodneſs and uſe, it
would be all one to him that had let
his horſe, to receive his own horſe or
another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:40290:57"/>
               <hi>We muſt underſtand</hi> (ſaith Dr. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton)
a ſpecial kind of Lending which for
penury of words, and narrowneſs of our
Engliſh wanteth a proper term. in</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
<hi>it is called</hi> [Mutuum] <hi>or</hi> Mutua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio—which
is (ſaith he) <hi>the free

for a time, then at the time ended the
ſame again. muſt be reſtored; why
then doth he name only the <hi>like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?</hi>
if only <hi>the like be reſtored</hi> then
the thing it ſelf is paſſed over for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> the <hi>Civilian</hi> in his Book
of <hi>Vſury</hi> puts the Caſe how hiring of
mony may be lawful; if a man bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
a 100 <hi>l.</hi> only to make ſhew of, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at ſome Bank, or otherwiſe to
perſwade the world that he hath a
100 <hi>l.</hi> of his own, and if he <hi>never</hi>
ſpend it but preſently reſtoreth the
ſelf ſame 100 pound which he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed,
in this Caſe the Lender may
lawfully take and Contract for hire or
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40290:57"/>
uſe of his mony becauſe it is not ſpent
in the uſe. This Caſe is borrowed
from the Papiſts, and allowes a man
to take <hi>Vſury</hi> for helping to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
the world, although himſelf be no
way damnified by the want of his
mony.</p>
            <p>But the grand impediment of
Letting money is, that the <hi>Borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
(ſay they, <hi>pag.</hi> 17.) <hi>ſtands to the
hazard of it,</hi> which they think to be
againſt the law of <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Concerning <hi>hazards,</hi> we
find that in the Law <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 12.
about beaſts delivered to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
only to keep, that if <hi>a beaſt be
ſtollen he ſhall make reſtitution to the
owner thereof;</hi> which Caſe ſhews
the owner doth not ſtand to the
hazard but the keeper only, who
yet hath not ſo much as the uſe
or property but only the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the beaſt, ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> tells
<hi>Laban</hi> Gen. 31. 39. <hi>that if any of
his ſheep were ſtoln by day or by
night, that he made them good;</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:40290:58"/>
therefore their rule faileth which ſaith
<hi>every thing periſheth to the right owner.</hi>
pag. 17.</p>
            <p>It may be anſwered, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Law was for things depoſited,
yet for things Let the Law is Cleer
that the borrower ſhall not make it
good or ſtand to the hazard, becauſe
<hi>it came for the hire. Exod.</hi> 22. 14. This
Text is either not underſtood, or
wreſted to a falſe ſenſe, as may beſt
appear if we cite the whole Text
which Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> hath curtail'd to fit
his own turn; the words are, <hi>If a man
borrow ought of his neighbour and it be
hurt or dye, the owner thereof not being
with it, he ſhall ſurely make it good, but
if the owner thereof be with it, he ſhall not
make it good, If it be a hired thing it
came for the hire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It may be thought the
Text intends beaſts only, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
goods or mony, becauſe the four
precedent verſes, to which the Text
hath reference, are reſtrained to
oxe, aſſe, or ſheep, or any beaſts:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40290:58"/>
and the ſame words of dying and
hurting are uſed in this verſe which
are uſed in the tenth verſe where beaſts
only are meant, which words are not
ſo proper to expreſs all ſorts of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
of other goods: withall there
is greater reaſon that the hazards
of beaſts ſhould not light upon the
borrower, becauſe, they by the courſe
of nature are daily ſubject to decay
and periſh, and many ſecret diſeaſes
lurk in them which the borrowers
cannot diſcern; whereas other goods,
and eſpecially mony, are not of ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhable
a diſpoſition, but their ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
deſtruction is moſt times by the
act or folly of man, and not from the
God of Nature. But if it be granted
that the Text underſtands all goods,
then indeed it comes home to the
point of <hi>Vſury;</hi> but it makes for it
and not againſt it: for the law is for
things let, <hi>that if they be hurt the owner
thereof not being by, he</hi> (the Borrower)
<hi>ſhall ſurely make it good.</hi> Now in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury
the owners do not, and for the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40290:59"/>
moſt part cannot ſtand by and ſee how
their mony miſcarries. Indeed when
a thing is hired for ſome particular end
wherewith the Letter is made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
then he may ſtand by and ſee how
it periſheth, and of ſuch a lending the
Text is beſt underſtood. It is plain
that the Letter (though he had the
property) did not alwayes ſtand unto
the hazard, but only when he ſtood
by, <hi>that it might appear</hi> (ſaith Dr. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
p. 17.) <hi>not to be the Borrowers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault.</hi>
The <hi>Rabbines</hi> expoſition of this
text may give ſome light to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of it, and it is thus; <hi>The words
are, if it be hurt or dye: that is, hurt in
the uſe, or dye in the work for which it
was hired: If a man</hi> (ſay they) <hi>hire a
tool for ſome particular uſe, if it be hurt in
doing the work it muſt not be made good:
ſo if I hire a horſe to plow with, and the
horſe whileſt he is in plowing dye, then I
am free. But if I borrow goods or beaſts,
and they be loſt or ſtoln, or hurt, or taken
away by violence, or dye, I am bound to
pay all, if ſuch violence do not befall it in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40290:59"/>
the time of the work. If I borrow a horſe
to plow with, and he dye either before or
after the plowing, I muſt make him good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To apply this Text to money, the
moſt that can be gathered is, <hi>that if
money be hurt in the uſing of it,</hi> without
the Borrowers default, it muſt be at
the <hi>Lenders hazard.</hi> But ſince mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
is not ordinarily hired for any
one particular uſe expreſſed, but in
general to be employed at the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers
diſcretion; how can the
Lender of money be comprehended
within that law, which did onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Borrower in caſe the thing
hired did periſh in that ſpecial uſe
for which it was borrowed? The
ground of the equity of this Law is,
<hi>if the thing hired be not able in its
own nature to do the thing for which
it was hired without periſhing, the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
is not to be at the hazard of it;</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
all men know to be able of its
own nature to do the thing for which
it was hired; if by any caſual or exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
accident money periſheth, the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40290:60"/>
Law provides no remedy in ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
It is one of the ſingular benefits
and the priviledge of mony in traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique
that it is not of a periſhable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The ends why policy found out
the uſe mony were many: the <hi>Chief</hi>
are, that it might be <hi>Durable, Porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
and <hi>Partible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to grant them that he that
ſtands to the hazard ſhould have all
the gains: Is there not hazard to be
found in the Letter as well as in the
Borrower of money? many that
have contracted for <hi>Vſury</hi> by bonds
and other ſecurity have loſt both
Principal and Uſe, and have been
thereby undone; ſurely ſuch people
find hazard in it. It is a rule in the
<hi>Civil law,</hi> that <hi>omnis mutuatio plerum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
damnoſa, eoque meretur compenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem.</hi>
It is fit therefore in equity,
<hi>that ſince</hi> the Lender ſtands in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
there ſhould be a gain due to
him alſo.</p>
            <p>But this gain they allow, <hi>So it may
be conditional, if the borrower gain.</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:40290:60"/>
And this conditional gain can only be
by <hi>Partnerſhip.</hi> As for letting of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
upon Condition of the Borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
gain, it is a courſe as miſchievous
and impoſſible as the letting of land
upon like Condition; without expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
no man can ſufficiently deſcribe
it. It would make all bargaines to
be nothing but ſutes in law, no debts
ſhould be due but upon proof and
witneſſes examined; nay there is no
poſſibility of knowing mens gaines or
loſſes without racking their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and opening a gap to perjury
for every unthrift in his own Cauſe.
Or if loſs and gain could be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
how ſhall it appear, whether it
be by default of the party or by the
act of God? many times they both
concur, and are ſo twiſted that no eye
of reaſon can diſtinguiſh them. In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
hereby every man is tyed to have
an eye to watch the disburſing of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
penny which he lends, which is a
thing impoſſible, and therefore the
law of reaſon and of all nations doth
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40290:61"/>
think it fitter to tolerate ſometimes a
miſchief which may happen by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
bargain upon an <hi>abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,</hi>
than to allow of a perpetual
inconvenience, which would follow
a <hi>Conditional Covenant</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the contracts of all Common-wealths.
In all letting there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
had of the caſualties, and
becauſe there may be a poſſibility of
extraordinary gaines it muſt counter-value
the extraordinary loſs if any
happen, both which being contingent,
and ſeldom happening, they are ſet
one againſt the other, and a middle
indifferent rate between them, which
doth ordinarily happen, belongs to
the Lender, who is not to partake in
the extremes: Becauſe it is rarely to
be ſhewed that any loſs can befall a
man in lifeleſs goods meerly by the
act of God, without the concurrence
of ſome fault of man, either of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
ignorance, indiſcretion, will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
or the like. To conclude,
the rule that guides the valuation of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40290:61"/>
all Contracts, is not what <hi>Caſually is
or may be,</hi> but what <hi>ordinarily</hi> is like
to happen.</p>
            <p>As for Partnerſhip (which is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
much magnified by the adverſaries
of <hi>Vſury</hi>) let it be examined what it
is. Thoſe are truly <hi>Partners</hi> who in
a <hi>Joynt ſtock</hi> communicate their <hi>paines</hi>
and <hi>travel:</hi> ſo that an equal induſtry
and privity goes along with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of the ſtock. There the
Truſt being reciprocal, the covenants
may be equal and the Laws do relieve
men upon their Covenants and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
agreements in ſuch <hi>Partnerſhip:</hi> But
in this their pretended Partnerſhip,
where there is but a truſt of one ſide,
no equality of paines, no privity in
trade, no partnerſhip in the matter of
ſtock, nor in the form or conſent of
<hi>negotiation,</hi> but only a Partnerſhip in
the gaines, this cannot truly be called
a Partnerſhip, but it is only the office
of Maſter and Servant under another
name, or falſe title, and differs only
in the manner of the wages, which
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40290:62"/>
this their caſe of Partnerſhip is contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and in the other abſolute. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
in this their counterfeit Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
a man may make no covenants
that can be good in Law, nor ſo much
as take a Bond for his Principal, but
he muſt only truſt to the honeſty of
his friend, ſince no articles can be
made that ſhall be legal except they
be <hi>Vſurious:</hi> nor can be drawn ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
as an honeſt man will be
bound by them, or ſo firm that a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt
man cannot ſafely break
them.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to me, that after all the
ſtir about <hi>Vſury,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fenton,</hi> and all
his fellows do allow of <hi>Vſury</hi> under
another name, <hi>Intereſt;</hi> they all agree
a man may lawfully take ſo it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his will; that is, when a man
detaines his mony from him againſt
his will; but if a man be ſo courteous
as to conſent that another ſhall keep
his mony, he muſt then ſtand to the
courteſie of the Borrower.</p>
            <p>Now that which they do call <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:40290:62"/>
they do allow in two caſes; Either
where there is, firſt <hi>Damnum contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens,</hi>
a loſs ariſing; or ſecondly, where
there is <hi>Lucrum ceſſans,</hi> gain ceaſing:
ſo that if either a man receive <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi>
or that his <hi>gain</hi> be but <hi>hindred,</hi>
he may take intereſt. Now in all
lending a mans gain is hindred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he hath not his mony to employ
when occaſion ſerveth, or ſhall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered:
Nor is it requiſite that <hi>ceaſing
gain</hi> muſt be certainly proved; for
that is impoſſible, being a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent,
but a probable eſtimation of
it may be allowed (by Dr. <hi>Downams</hi>
confeſſion <hi>pag.</hi> 166.) and in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
<hi>gain ceaſeth,</hi> or is hindred,
whereſoever there is Lending. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by this their own Scholaſtical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
there is Intereſt due for all
Lending. Only <hi>ſucceſſive</hi> or <hi>intervſury</hi>
which is before delay of <hi>Payment</hi> they
would fain exclude. But if <hi>Intereſt</hi> be
(as their own <hi>Melancthon</hi> ſaith) <hi>a debt
which he oweth by the law of Nature, who
hath been to another an effectual cauſe of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40290:63"/>
dammage, or hath hindred his gain,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Nature teacheth that no man muſt
be enriched by the hindring of another,</hi>
according to the rule of St. <hi>Paul 2 Cor.
8. 13. That one be not eaſed, that another
may be burdened:</hi> Then it will follow,
that delay of <hi>Payment doth naturally
begin</hi> from the firſt <hi>minute</hi> of Lending;
if any will abridge himſelf of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of <hi>Nature</hi> by the <hi>giving</hi> day
for payment, yet if it be by a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
conditional</hi> to pay ſo much inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
at the day appointed, then ſuch a
Contract is but the ratifying of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
debt, with a <hi>dilatory</hi> payment for
the benefit of the Borrower.</p>
            <p>Thus after all their pretended impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
of Letting mony, they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to confeſs at laſt, that an <hi>Intereſt</hi>
may be juſtly due and taken; which is
nothing elſe but a hire, a recompence,
or an <hi>increaſe of it.</hi> The ſole doubt
they make is about the <hi>contracting</hi> for
<hi>interuſury.</hi> Neither is Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> nor
Dr. <hi>Downam,</hi> ſo ſtiff againſt contracts
when they come to the point, as at firſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40290:63"/>
they made ſhew of. Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> ſaith,
<hi>pag. 64. It is great reaſon that the debtor
ſhould truſt the creditors charity, and not
the creditor rely upon the fidelity of the
debtor; and Bonds may in ſome caſes be
lawfully made, which cannot ſo lawfully be
exacted.</hi> This he ſpeaks of contracts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any condition of hazard expreſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alſo Dr.</hi> Downam <hi>doth adde,</hi> That
if there be a covenant of the one ſide <hi>in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventum
lucri,</hi> to partake of the gain, and
on the other ſide but a purpoſe of bearing
part of the loſs—I would not altogether
condemn ſuch a contract, pag 163.</p>
            <p>Thus both theſe Divines do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
that a contract may be made for
intereſt, if there be but a purpoſe in
the Lender not to exact or oppreſs
thereby. Yet like men uncertain and
doubtful what to conclude, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
allow a man to take intereſt
ſo he do not contract for it, at other
times to contract for it, ſo he do not
take it, (<hi>p. 27.) One while a bond may be
lawfully made, ſo it be not exacted; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
while it is lawful to take where it
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40290:64"/>
is not lawful to covenant or contract.</hi>
Again, Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> ſaith, <hi>pag. 129.
That the poyſon of Vſury is in ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
ſo cloſely and cunningly conveyed,
as the very turn of the intention of the
mind may alter the caſe to make it juſt
or unjuſt; the contract remaining one
and the ſame.</hi> If one and the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
may be juſt and unjuſt, then all
contracts are not unjuſt by his own
confeſſion. In another place (<hi>p.</hi> 125.)
he tells us, <hi>We may puzzle him with
ſome caſes ſo cunningly contrived where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we can find no difference either in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
or Charity from other lawful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts:
Then</hi> quaere <hi>whether it be within
the Definition of Vſury—If it appear
juſt and lawful, it ſhall not appear uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
it may perhaps border or coaſt upon
Vſury. Yet our concluſion ſhall ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
entire,</hi> That Uſury properly ſo
called is ſimply unlawful. A trim Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.
But what are we the wiſer for
knowing that all <hi>Vſury</hi> is unlawful,
unleſs he teach us what is <hi>properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Vſury?</hi> This is the main doubt,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40290:64"/>
               <hi>what is Vſury, and what is not; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all increaſe, or increaſe only from the
poor; whether all contracts for gain by
money be Vſury.</hi> If Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> may be
puzled, and be not able to tell us what
Contracts differ from Juſtice and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and what not; If one and the
ſame contract may be juſt and unjuſt;
if that <hi>uſurious</hi> contracts, <hi>as they do
approach unto equity ſo far forth do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the nature of Vſury,</hi> then are we
ſtill ignorant what <hi>properly is Vſury,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we may know that it is <hi>unlawful</hi> if we
knew what it were. This is the laſt and
ſafeſt retreat that Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> findeth.</p>

Who is perſwaded that the very conceit
of theſe grounds (of the Philoſophers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments)
hath moved many to think
more favourably of Vſury it ſelf than
there is juſt cauſe—The force of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
argument taken from the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of money, and the unnatural brood of
Vſury, being mingled with metaphors, if
it be not rightly apprehended, is obſcure
and doubtful. That alſo of ſpending mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in the firſt uſe, as if uſe and property
were inſeparable—is much ſubject to cavil.</p>
            <p>By theſe paſſages we may ſee what
little confidence Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> putteth in
the arguments of the Heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
againſt <hi>Vſury.</hi> As for the
bare authority of theſe men, the ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
determinations of ſo few Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
are no way to be compared
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40290:65"/>
with the grave wiſdom of whole States,
which by practice &amp; by Cuſtoms in all
ages have approved thereof. I know the
abuſe of <hi>Vſury</hi> hath given juſt cauſe
both to Chriſtians and Heathens to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame
bitterly againſt it. <hi>Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing</hi>
(as Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> tells us) alſo
Letting of <hi>Land,</hi> and other tradings
have their manifold abuſes, and yet
are things lawful in themſelves; and
whereas all other trades do oppreſs
but within their own Circle or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
and in ſuch particulars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they deal, <hi>Vſury</hi> dealing with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
which is uſed in all trades, hath
made the abuſe thereof more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and therefore all men have the
more frequent occaſion to ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it.</p>
            <p>The Civil Law which was gathered
out of all the beſt antient Laws both
<hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and which is
moſt in uſe at this day, doth allow
<hi>Vſury.</hi> The Laws of <hi>Venice, Genoa,</hi>
and the Low-Countries (three ſimply
the richeſt States in <hi>Europe</hi>) do allow
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40290:66"/>
thereof, and yet are free from poor,
which perſwades that <hi>Vſury</hi> is not ſo
hurtful to a ſtate. As for the ſtatute
Laws of this land they do vary, and
one ſtatute miſlikes and repeals ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but they all allow <hi>Vſury</hi> of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans;

            <p>The conſtant practice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

            <p>To end this point, if all Laws

            <p>It is to ſome Doubtful, therefore unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
becauſe Whatſoever is not of faith is
Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This argument doth not
make it ſimply unlawfull to all, but
only to ſuch as doubt, and therefore
it proves not the point. For Dr. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
his poſition is, that all <hi>Vſury</hi> is of
it ſelf a ſin, and ſo nothing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
By this Doctrine he firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexeth
the underſtanding of the
weak, and ſo makes them doubt, and
when he finds them doubtful, he uſeth
their doubting to prove it unlawful,
becauſe they doubt, whereas if it be
ſimply a ſin of it ſelf it is as well a ſin
if a man doubt not as if he doubt.
And the place of St. <hi>Paul Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 14. by
him alledged, ſpeaks not of ſins, but
of things <hi>indifferent (as eating</hi>) which
by doubting only are made ſins to the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40290:67"/>
doubters, and to no body elſe. Now if
the Cauſe why men doubt whether all
Uſury be ſin, be only for that Dr. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
and ſome others teach ſo, then the
ſin of thoſe that doubt may fall heavy
upon the Cauſers of it. And if Dr. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
allow Uſury to be doubtful, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but argue raſhneſs peremptorily
to determine there is no doubt of it,
thereby to enſnare the Conſciences of
the ſimple.</p>
            <p>Beſides the doubting ſpoken of by
the Apoſtle, though it were of things
indifferent, yet formerly before the
coming of Chriſt they were things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
preſcribed by the Law, but,
after, taken away by the Goſpel, ſo that
to doubt of them was conſequently to
condemn the Goſpel, and deny the
faith in Chriſt. But the doubting of
Uſury is no eſtabliſhing of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Law, or overthrowing of our
belief and faith in the Goſpel. Neither
is all doubting meant but ſuch only as
overcometh Faith, for there is no faith
but it is mingled with ſome doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40290:67"/>
Laſtly, it is not neceſſary that faith
ſhould be alwayes grounded upon the
Word of God, for if a man be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of any thing by the light of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
or by <hi>Senſe,</hi> he is juſtly ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it. To the confirmation of this
doctrine, I muſt produce ſome places of
<hi>judicious Hooker. The will of God</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>by which we are to judge our actions,
no ſound Divine in the world ever denied
to be in Part made manifeſt, even by the
light of Nature, and not by Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi>
pag. 97. And he adds in another
place, <hi>that there may be a certain belief
grounded upon other aſſurance than Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—we
are ſaid to believe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
we are certainly perſwaded of, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be by reaſon or ſenſe,</hi> pag. 60.
And in a third he gives this reaſon; <hi>It
is not required, nor can be exacted at our
hands, that we ſhould yield unto any
thing other aſſent than ſuch as doth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the evidence which is to be had of
that we aſſent unto: for which cauſe, even
in matters divine, concerning ſome things
we may lawfully doubt; of ſome things
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40290:68"/>
we may very well retain an opinion that
they are probable, and not unlikely to
be true. Then are our Conſciences beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
and in moſt agreeable ſort unto
God and Nature ſettled, when they are ſo
far perſwaded, as thoſe grounds of perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which are to be had will bear, which
thing I ſo much the rather ſet down, for
that I ſee how a number of Souls are for
want of right information in this point
oftentimes grievouſly vexed, when bare
and unbridled concluſions are put into
their minds: they finding not themſelves
to have thereof any great certainty Imagin
this proceedeth only from lack of faith,
and that the Spirit of God doth not work
in them, as it doth in true believers: by
this means their hearts are much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
they fall into anguiſh and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
whereas the truth is that how bold
and confident ſoever we may be in words,
when it cometh to the point of tryal, ſuch
as the evidence is, which the truth hath
either in it ſelf or through proof, ſuch
is the hearts aſſent thereto, neither can
it be ſtronger, being grounded as it
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40290:68"/>
ſhould be:</hi> page 73. 74. Thus far Mr.
<hi>Hooker.</hi> Therefore it is no argument
to conclude that becauſe the <hi>Scripture</hi>
doth not allow <hi>Vſury,</hi> therefore it may
not be uſed: for if the <hi>Scripture</hi> do
not abſolutely condemn it, it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

               <hi>I leave thoſe that doubt to conſider
what Dr.</hi> Fenton <hi>himſelf ſaith within

This Vſury which we have in hand is no
principle of faith, no myſtery of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be apprehended in the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is no argument of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
from Scripture, but of Philoſophy
from <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, If it were of force, it ſerves
only againſt <hi>Vſury</hi> of mony, but not
of all other things.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is confeſſed, that mony
conſidered as it is a <hi>metal,</hi> is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
by nature apt to generation &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe;
and yet even that may be
doubted of: But mony conſidered as
it is mony, which Art not Nature
hath produced, may be allowed an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
increaſe or gain, as well as
houſes, ſhips, and mamy other things
not natural. Policy hath ordained the
value of Metals to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
rule and meaſure for the worth
of all things vendible, and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
eſtimation it is accompted in the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40290:69"/>
place and ſtead of ſuch things; ſo that
in opinion and uſe mony is both land,
houſe, horſe, corn, or any thing that is
valued by it; even man himſelf, who
in worth exceeds all other creatures, is
by Gods own valuation, prized at a
certain ſum of mony, and fifty Shekels
of Silver were accepted by God in the
place and ſtead of a man who by vow
belonged unto him. <hi>Levit.</hi> 27, 3.</p>
            <p>It being then ſo apparent, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is by Art taken, and uſed for all
things valuable, both by man and
God himſelf (who had his peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
Coin, the Shekel of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,
for all ſacred uſes, <hi>Exodus</hi> 30.
13.) It follows in all reaſon, that
ſince the nature of moſt things that
are valued and ſold is to bring forth an
increaſe, that Mony it ſelf alſo which
is eſteemed for them ſhould doe
the like, or elſe Art is fruſtrated of
her intention, who found out the
uſe of mony only for the eaſe and
benefit of Trade, which proves to be
a diſcommoditie if the benefit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>increaſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40290:70"/>
be loſt by the converſion into
mony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is further objected by Dr.</hi> Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
that mony may not be let for hire, as
a horſe, a houſe, or a cow, becauſe theſe
things are the worſe for letting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What thinks he, may a man
take hire for a houſe when he binds
the <hi>Leſſee</hi> to leave it in as good repair
as he found it? Many times a horſe by
a moderate journey after long reſt is
the better, whether may the <hi>Letter</hi>
take mony for his hire? If this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were ſound, that no hire ought
to be taken, but where the things are
the worſe for uſing, then I believe all
the Rent that hath been paid for land
ſince <hi>Noahs</hi> Floud hath been unjuſtly
taken: For it will hardly appear that
any Acre of Land is worſe now than
in his dayes; ſince many Acres are
bettered by tillage and manuring,
which by lying waſte are hurt; and
houſes alſo decay moſt for want of
inhabiting. The true rule of Letting
is not only the Lenders loſs in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40290:70"/>
of the thing lent, but the
Borrowers gain by the uſe of it. And
we muſt conſider, as well what the
owner is the worſe by the want of that
uſe, as what the thing lent is impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
If another uſe my land, though
it be not the worſe, yet he is the better
by having the crop of it, and I am the
worſe by wanting that benefit of it
which he made; therefore I juſtly
challenge Rent for it. The like caſe
is for mony, the Borrower hath the uſe
of it, and though the mony be not
the worſe for uſing, yet the Lender is
the worſe by miſſing the commoditie
which the other makes of it, and the
Borrower is bettered by the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alſo it is objected</hi> (pag. 148.) That
mony is void of all immediate uſe in it
ſelf to the poſſeſsor while he doth enjoy
<hi>it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> So it is with Land, which
immediately neither clothes nor feeds
any man, but by the mediation of til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
and paſturage both are effected,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40290:71"/>
and though no man immediately eats
or wears mony, yet by the meanes
of it food and raiment are procured.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another objection is,</hi> That mony the
more it doth increaſe the more it may,
which is unnatural, and contrary to other
increaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is ſo in other ſorts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe;
for one ſheep brings forth a
Lamb, and that Sheep and Lamb in
time bring forth a double increaſe,
which multiplies to a third, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
ſo one hundred pound brings
forth ten pound, and both together
in time increaſe to produce eleven
pound. The only difference is, that
mony is more durable than other fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things, which by courſe of Nature
are more periſhable.</p>

ſaid <hi>Vſury belongs to the ſecond Table;</hi>
Why is it here made a breach of the
firſt?</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Vſurers</hi> ſecurity is to
arm himſelf againſt the <hi>ordinary frauds,
negligences,</hi> or other follies of the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower.
If by the hand of God an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
loſs do happen, by the like
meanes alſo an extraordinary gaine may
be raiſed ſometimes, both which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the borrower, except the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the lender, to whom he is to
truſt, relieve him. And ſurely the <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer</hi>
hath greater cauſe, and ſeems alſo
to truſt God more than any other man,
and is leaſt armed againſt him. He
had need pray againſt foul weather,
tempeſt, wind, and wrack; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he be no Husbandman, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
Tradeſman, no Labourer, yet
by the thriving of all theſe he muſt live,
if all or any of theſe miſcarry, it is not
his bonds many times which help
him. Neither againſt the hand of God
only is he unarmed, but againſt
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40290:72"/>
the frauds of men many times his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
cannot defend him. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have been defrauded of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
debts by fraudulent deeds of gift,
by concealing of goods, and divers
other wayes? It is true ſome few in a
City may ſometimes attain to a noted
wealth by Uſury; but theſe are but
as cyphers in compariſon of hundreds,
who living by the like employment of
money, do ſcarce attain to a moderate
gain whereby to maintain themſelves
in their firſt condition; and many
times as skilful Uſurers as the beſt,
what by the loſs ſometimes of intereſt,
ſometimes of Principal, and other
whiles of both, and many times by the
lying ſtill of their mony for want of
reaſonable ſecurity, have proved in
the end perfect Beggars by this trade.
And what greater Argument can
there be of the hazard and danger of
mony that is lent, than the Common
opinion of the world, which eſteems
a ſmall revenew in land of Fee ſimple,
more ſafe and certain than almoſt a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40290:72"/>
double encreaſe in mony with perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
hazard? and for this cauſe land is
dearer than mony.</p>
            <p>As for taking of Bonds for payment,
it is no more injurious to the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God than to have a bond or
covenant of a Tenant for the payment
of his rent; for although ſome years by
the unſeaſonableneſs of the year, or by
ſome other act of God, the land yields
not the rent contracted for, yet the
Tenant is abſolutely bound to pay it
without any condition of gaining ſo
much by the land: And the reaſon is
grounded upon great equity, and is
all one both for contracts of land and
mony to be <hi>abſolute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nither GOD nor Nature have
proportioned the valuation of Lands,
Commodities, or Moneys; no Text can
be brought to prove an Acre muſt be
juſt ſold at ſuch a price, or a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity

that things are not lent but let, if they goe

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> can ſhew no
reaſon why mony may <hi>not be let, as

great neceſſity to lend freely to the
poor, yet this work of Charity doth
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40290:73"/>
not hinder me from letting the ſame
thing where there is not the like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the uſe of money for a time be worth

confeſſeth (<hi>pag.</hi> 99.) The rule may
better hold in Letting, which is no
work of Charity, though both in Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and Selling Charity is to guide
us. It doth not follow that becauſe I
muſt lend a ſhilling for a day, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I may not lend a pound for a

there is often both <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>
ſhewed: As, if I let a thing for
half the value the uſe of it is worth,
to one whom others dare not truſt
with their goods. If ſome things
which are ſpent in the firſt uſe may
be ſold for increaſe, why may not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things that are uſed be let in the
ſame ſort, ſince <hi>letting</hi> is but a <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary</hi>

a perpetual kind of letting. If
ſuch things as are bought this day for

            <p>Nor can there be any reaſon ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſince money hath a gainful uſe in

            <p>Dr. <hi>Andrews</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>

from the Rule of our Saviour,
<hi>Luke 6. 31. as ye would that men ſhould
do to you, do ye alſo to them likewiſe.
Nemo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſibi vellet Vſuras in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligi,
cum fratre ſio agat igitur.</hi> No
man is willing to have <hi>Vſury</hi> taken of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40290:74"/>
him, therefore he muſt not take him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
every man deſires to borrow
<hi>freely,</hi> therefore he muſt lend freely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Rule of our <hi>Saviour</hi>
muſt neceſſarily be thus expounded,
<hi>Whatſoever ye will,</hi> that is, <hi>Whatſoever
you will according to right reaſon or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Juſtice;</hi> for if any man be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
or ſo frantick as to will
that others ſhould kill him, yet my
Lord of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> will not ſay that
therefore that man may kill another.
So he that deſires to borrow freely,
breaks the Rule of common equity
and rectified reaſon, by coveting his
neighbours goods; for he that deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to benefit himſelf by the uſe of
another mans goods, doth therein
uncharitably deſire the hindrance of
his neighbour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alſo it is objected, that the</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of gain which is made by Vſury is
unlawful. <hi>pag.</hi> 100.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is no proof againſt
all increaſe of money; but onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
exceſſive gains: whereas it
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40290:75"/>
ſhould be proved that <hi>Vſury</hi> of a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in the hundred is a ſin, as well as
of ten pounds.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By this Rule all gain of
merchandizing is condemned, which
is ordinarily far greater than that of
ten in the hundred.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The greatneſs of gain by
Lending muſt be eſtimated by the
common opinion of the Countrey:
otherwiſe how can any mans Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
warrant him to purchaſe any
inheritance? Men buy Land to them
and to their heirs for ever, that is till
Doomſ-day; which when it will come
no man knows, and yet as if every
purchaſer knew the hour, he bargain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for Land at fifteen or ſixteen
years purchaſe. But the laſt day may
come within a year, or within fifteen,
or perhaps not within fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years: howſoever it be uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
yet the publick valuation doth
eſteem it Certain; And no man buyes
land at fifteen years purchaſe, upon
Condition that Doomſ-day come not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40290:75"/>
before, becauſe perhaps then he may
have a dear penny-worth: Nor upon
Condition that if the World laſt lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than fifteen years, that thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
the Purchaſer ſhould pay a
further ſum. No, but Cuſtome thinks
fit to make an abſolute bargain, though
by the meer act of God it may be made
a dear purchaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As the Argument of the greatneſs
of</hi> gain in Vſury <hi>makes againſt trading
or merchandizing, ſo thereby alſo
bargaining for Leaſes for term of
years will be made unjuſt; And this
may the better appear if we examine
one of Dr.</hi> Fenton<hi>'s examples of</hi> Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>in this kind:</hi> If (<hi>ſaith he,</hi> pag. 21.)
purpoſely to avoid the Statute, I will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
an annuity of twenty pound <hi>per
annum</hi> with an hundred pound for ten
years, this is bargain and ſale, yet the
very ſame with Vſury, differing only in
parchment, and manner of Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſubject to the ſame iniquity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality;
poiſoned with purpoſe of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Statute and penalty of Vſury.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:40290:76"/>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If onely the purpoſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the Statute makes his Caſe to be
<hi>Vſury,</hi> then before the Statute it was
no <hi>Vſury,</hi> for there could be no
purpoſe to avoid a penalty that was
not, and this is to make <hi>Vſury</hi> a
breach only of Mans Law and not of
God's. Let us ask Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Leaſe for years and annuity
bought with money be <hi>Vſury</hi> ſimply
in it ſelf; he dares not ſay it, his
anſwer is, pag. 129. <hi>We cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
it for Vſury;</hi> and yet he ſeeth
moſt apparently it is of the very ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame
nature with <hi>Lending</hi> upon Bonds,
and differs only in the ſecurity: upon
Bond a man ties himſelf, upon a
Leaſe a man ties his Land, in both
theſe there is the like increaſe by
Money, and both pay alike at the
end.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This Caſe I find put of
a Leaſe that brings in above ten in
the hundred, thereby to make it more
odious: but give us leave to put it in
other termes, and then ask his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40290:76"/>
If with a hundred pound I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
an annuity of ten pounds <hi>per
annum</hi> and twenty ſhillings over year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for ten yeares, is this <hi>Vſury</hi> becauſe
it is an increaſe above the principal?
It is the very ſelf-ſame bargain in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with his, it differs only in the
quantity of increaſe. Now both by his
definition and argument, as well the
increaſe of a penny is <hi>Vſury</hi> as of ten
pounds in the hundred, ſo then by
his doctrine a man may not buy a leaſe
worth one penny more than his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal.
If it be pretended that bargain
and ſale of leaſes be lawful if it be
reaſonable, otherwiſe not; then if the
unreaſonableneſs only of the bargain
make it a ſin of <hi>Vſury,</hi> then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
doctrine which ſaith <hi>all increaſe is
Vſury, is thereby denied,</hi> And I confeſs
that an unreaſonable bargain is a ſin,
but of theft in general not of <hi>Vſury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The principal purpoſe in
buying an annuity or leaſe for yeares
is to gain by a hundred pound, which
ſince it could not ſafely be done by
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40290:77"/>
bonds, therefore by a ſecond intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
men labour to avoid the Statute,
ſo that to gain and in gaining to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the Statute is the purpoſe of ſuch
Contracts, and not chiefly to avoid
the Statute, which might beſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
by not purchaſing at all.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is no ſin to avoid a
Statute by lawful meanes; if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
of bargain and ſale be in it ſelf
lawful, why ſhould it be a vice and
not a vertue thereby to avoid the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of the Law, ſince laws are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
made to force men to avoid
them by lawful meanes.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Whereas Dr. <hi>Fenton (pag.</hi>
129.) concludeth, that if <hi>ſimply with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any pretence ſuch annuity of rent be
bought or ſold, we cannot condemn it for
Vſury.</hi> It follows that the pretence
or intention of the heart, and not the
Contract makes it <hi>Vſury:</hi> and that (as
he himſelf confeſſeth <hi>pag.</hi> 128.) <hi>if the
intention be right, that which formally is
Vſurious, upon the matter may in juſtice be
equivalent to a lawful Contract.</hi> If formal
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40290:77"/>
               <hi>Vſury</hi> may be no <hi>Vſury,</hi> we muſt look
for a new definition of <hi>Vſury</hi> in the
Conſciences of men, and not in Dr.
<hi>Fenton</hi>'s treatiſe; And if <hi>Vſury</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in Buying and Selling, what
Contract will be found in the world
without <hi>Vſury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Inſtance in ſome other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,
let us conſider of the abſolute
buying and ſelling of land, or of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing
an annuity for life; becauſe
theſe two Contracts are eſteemed by
moſt men to be the lawfulleſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
yet in both theſe, the juſt and
ordinary valuation both of fee ſimple
land and of leaſes for lives is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and guided by <hi>Vſury</hi> only, and as
the uſe of mony goeth higher or low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
ſo the prices of theſe riſe and fall,
ſo that in very truth he that purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
land is the greateſt <hi>Vſurer</hi> in the
world, becauſe he maketh the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and certaineſt gain by his bargain,
for example; Admit land is bought
and ſold for ſixteen yeares purchaſe,
and let the inheritance of the land be
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40290:78"/>
made away for ſo little a ſumm as the
land will bring home in ſixteen years;
what Conſcience is there to keep that
for ever, which in ſo ſhort a time pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the purchaſer his principal? There
can be no other reaſon yielded for
this great diſproportion but this, that
both the Purchaſer and Seller do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
value the uſe of the mony, and
do make the bargain accordingly. The
purchaſe-mony conſidered with the
Uſe of it would laſt about a 1000 years
in paying yearly ſo much as the Rent
of the land is, therefore the Purchaſer
expects to enjoy, and the Seller in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to part with the land for ever,
becauſe the inheritance of the land af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a thouſand yeares is not valuable,
for that ordinarily within four or five
hundred yeares the poſſeſſions of the
ancienteſt families come to a period,
or decay. In like manner, an annuity
for life is bought for nine yeares pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe,
not becauſe a mans life is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
taken to laſt but nine years, but
becauſe the mony with the uſe will
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40290:78"/>
laſt almoſt twice nine years in paying
the annuity: ſo that if the Purchaſer
of the annuity dye within eighteen
years, the Grantor may be a gainer, or
at the leaſt a ſaver, by the bargain;
but if he live above eighteen yeares
the Grantor muſt be at a loſs. This
Caſualtie of a leaſe for life, wherein
the Buyer hopes by his own life to be
a gainer, and the Seller hopes by the
death of the Buyer to be a gainer,
hath made ſome men (if we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi>) to think that
a leaſe for life is the worſt kind or
double <hi>Vſury,</hi> beauſe there is an Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
intention on both ſides, as well
in the Grantor as in the Grantee to
gain.</p>
            <p>If many men who are fit for Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
live idlely on <hi>Vſury,</hi> they ſin, but
no otherwiſe than thoſe that let their
lands: they may and ought to ſerve
God and their Country in ſome Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if they do not, it is no fault of
<hi>Vſury,</hi> but an abuſe of it. Neither
let any man fear that <hi>Vſury</hi> will bring
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40290:79"/>
idleneſs in the world, for if all men be
idle there can be no <hi>Vſury.</hi> It is the
uſury-imployment of men by their
trading that makes the uſe of mony
to be at ſo high a value, and many
muſt be idle if they borrow not a
ſtock to ſet them on work.</p>

            <head>10. Of the Vncharitableneſs of
Vſury.</head>
            <p>In the laſt Chapter of Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi>
his ſecond book, I did expect ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
argument againſt <hi>Vſury,</hi>
becauſe it treats of the breach of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
by <hi>Vſury,</hi> and the oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them: I did long to ſee it prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but now I am come to it, I find
it the ſhorteſt Chapter in his book,
both in quantity, and proof, the little
that he ſaith is in effect, <hi>that Vſurers
are commonly uncharitable</hi> pag. 106.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. did expect to have it prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that all Uſury is in it ſelf unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and he tels us that all <hi>Vſurers</hi>
are ſo: It is the fault of the men, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40290:79"/>
not of the thing. Thrift which of it
ſelf is a vertue, being abuſed is the
hinderance of Charity, and yet Thrift
is no breach of Charity: A thrifty man
and an <hi>Vſurer</hi> may be merciful to the
poor, becauſe they are many times
better able than others. If <hi>Vſury</hi> of
it ſelf were a breach of Charity: then
not to lend to <hi>Vſury</hi> were an act of
Charity: which is but a meer Privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and no Act at all. The reaſon why
<hi>Vſurers</hi> be commonly found merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
is for that in many men Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs
makes them <hi>Vſurers,</hi> and not
<hi>Vſury</hi> brings them to be Covetous.
Many <hi>Vſurers</hi> are found well diſpoſed
to Charity, and give twice as much to
<hi>Charitable</hi> uſes as thoſe that have twice
their eſtate in Lands and are no <hi>Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</hi>
Since then all <hi>Vſurers</hi> are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable,
and thoſe that be, are
found, and not made ſuch by <hi>Vſury,</hi>
it is but ſmall Charity to ſay that <hi>Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
of it ſelf is the breach of Charity.</p>
