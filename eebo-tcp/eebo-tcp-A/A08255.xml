            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

His vpper garment was a loose robe of chaungeable taffeta, skie coloured or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more bright: which had such a reflecting glasse, and was of so great a length, it couered and ouer shadowed all the rest. His pace was flow, which made me thinke him a <hi>Saturnist.</hi> His personage tall and comely, an obseruing eye, a sullen and irefull countenance: and still as I thought to take strickt view of his attire, the colour of the roabe so dazelled mine eyes, that I cleane lost it: Some strange fellow I tooke him to be, and but that I held it vnpossible, I should haue thought him inuisible: For he was but (as it were) a solid clowne cut out in the fashion of a man.

                  <hi>A</hi> couple of néere kinsmen of mine, called <hi>Pigeons,</hi> went to Lawe, and fedde their Attorneys: Either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading their Clyents their cause was good, and kept them so long in hope of had I wist, that they were faine to sell their horse to continue lawe for the bridle. To be short, one of the Brothers going to carry a couple of Capons to his Attorney to séeke spéedy dispach of his suit, hee tould him that for a couple of Angells extraordinary, hee would assure him of iudgement on his side the next Court day: The poore man glad of that newes went home, sould a couple of pretty heyfars to prouide the money, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it home. His Attorney to manifest how forward hee was in his behalfe, writ a letter to his aduersaries Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to intreate him the cause might come to present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch; and who should carry it but this <hi>Pigeon</hi>: wel glad was he of his good successe, and to the lawier hee goes; and by the way hee proued exceeding drowsie, and fell a sléepe: In his sléepe hee dreamt that hee saw the two Attorneys drinking, and excéeding merry in a stately Gallery, and two tame doues came flying in at the Casement, houe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring about them: And whilest they sate laughing the poor tame birds, flew about into the fields, and gardaines ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning, and in their beaks, brought wheat, peass, and such graine, as by their industry they could finde, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it to the lawiers, who still as they were gonne for more, laught at their folly: At last the poore birds beeing tired, would haue eaten some of the graines they had

At their vnkindnesse he awaked, and comparing the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the two doues to his brother and him, thought it might be a Morrall of their owne folly: But then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to minde his Attorneys promis, and hope of his suits dispach, hée beegan to checke his rashe iudgement. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he concluded with himselfe to sée the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the letter: with that vnripping the seale, he bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reade, and found the letter written to this effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

He shall be namelesse in this place, and yet for a groate matter you shall finde him registred in <hi>Bulles</hi> Kallender, amongst the ranke of his best Benefactors. This Francklin (I scorne to doe the attribute of gentility so much wrong, as to lay it vpon him) being one of the head men of the parish, and hauing past thorough many vnder Offices of Sir <hi>Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendshippe,</hi> as Scauenger, Sideman, <hi>cum multis alijs,</hi> hée was by the generall consent of the Towneshippe elected Church-warden, and to win the name of a Benefactor to the Church, and haue his name writ vp in <hi>Roman letters</hi> ouer one of the glasse windowes. The boyes playing at stooleball, by chaunce broke a quarry of the glasse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he complayned to the Towneship, and tither had, or did his vtmost to haue the poor boy whipt, and vnder shew of zeale (which had a little afore schorcht him, he tooke mee down the whole window, and at his owne proper costs &amp; charges built vp an other in the place: But by report of the workemen, the new was too foote euery way lesse then the old.

That day he set Thatchers a work, and in stéed of the Leade coate, clapt on a ierkin of straw: according to that of <hi>Dionisius,</hi> who comming into a Church, he saw many Idolls richly cloathed, some in gold, and some in siluer: he disroabed them all, and made them good hansome suits of Linsey-wolsey. Being askt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Oh (quoth he) these golden coates in winter were so could, that the Saints wer fain to blow their fingers ends to catch them a heate, and in sommer so heauy, they could not walke abroade for heate, priuily checking the vaine su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition of those that were prodigall in bestowing such bounty vpon a stone: but (quoth he) I out of a tender res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of their healths, haue made them good Linsey-woolsey cassocks, good &amp; warm for winter, &amp; excéeding light &amp; coole for Sommer. So this Church-warden féeling the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Church too weake for the Leaden couer, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed it in straw, and turned the leade to his priuate vse, which by the iudgement of the workemen, trebly equalled his stubble vpper garment, besides the parishes allowance which was not little. About the same time, a friend of his, as I remember, his brothers sonne, for some trespasse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lawe lay in prison vpon a repriue, and some ten pound matter would haue purchast his pardon. He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing none, or very fewe friends of ability to disburse so much money on the suddaine made meanes to him being his vncle, and sent his letter by two sufficient poore men, to enter bond for the repayment of it, his answere was, he would doe any reasonable matter for his kinsman, to his power, but he was imployed about building, and repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church, and not hauing of his owne to finish it, hee was faine to strech his credit to borrow.
