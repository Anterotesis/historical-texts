            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>His Maieſties reuniting himſelfe with the Parliament.</head>
            <p>THe methode of our happineſſe hath of a long time been anticipated and kept from us by invective and malevolent perſons, the Parliaments endeavours been extenuated by deeracting its power and priviledges, the ſafety and proſperity of the Common-wealth deferred; and the hope of the loyall ſubiects deiected by the many differences falling betwixt the King and Parliament in State affairs, through the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive deluſions of ſuch as rather deſire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the motions of evill, then propogate the truth, and labour the Kingdoms good. How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py then are we now, and how much are we bound to praiſe the name of the Almighty, that hath been pleaſed to remove theſe lets, and to inſpire his Maieſty with a care of his Kingdome, &amp; to ioyne with the Parliament to confiſcate their grievances, as by the ſequell wil appeare.</p>
            <p>The one and twentieth of Ianuary his Maieſty being at Windſor, and being often moved by ſome well-minded ſubiects, to ioyne with the Parliament for the ſetling of Religion, peace and tranquility of his Kingdome, ſhewing the divers inconveniences which were like to enſue, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb facs="tcp:62148:3"/>
of the diviſion and difference betwixt his Maieſty and the Parliament; the matter being debated before him, and finding the eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers like to follow without a ſudden agreement, was pleaſed to give this gratious anſwer: That whatſoever had beene remiſſely hitherto, and contrary to the will of the Parliament, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and authorized by him, ſhould be called in; and that hereafter hee would altogether ioyne with them for the conſummating of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes peace and happineſſe; and to that intent ſent a Meſſage to the Parliament concerning the ſame. Whereupon it was reſolved by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and his Maieſty, that on the Munday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Biſhops ſhould be called to the triall; and the Articles exhibited againſt them, to bee produced: and that they (as it is alledged) being the firſt grievance which diſturbs the preſent Parliament, as they ſhould be found guilty, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive puniſhment according to thir deſerts. And next, that the innovations concerning ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ceremonies, ſhould bee made utterly voyd: that the tyrannicall power of their Court, and exaction by them uſed, ſhould be reformed acor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſtatute made in <hi>Q. Elizabeths</hi> dayes, to that effect, <hi>Anno</hi> 1593. As for other matters concerning the ſetling of peace in this his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Kingdome, hee ſent his reſolution in this manner: That whatſoever they ſhould finde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the procuring of the aforeſaid peace, he would be conformable unto them, as far as it might ſtand with his Honour and Maieſticke di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity: againſt which he was verilily perſwaded,
<pb facs="tcp:62148:3"/>
there wus none of them that ſhould degrade or goe. As concerning the Parliaments motion to him to lay open to them who they were that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed thoſe opprobrious Articles againſt thoſe worthy Stateſmen, the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> M. <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil Hollis,</hi> M. <hi>Pym,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerig,</hi> M. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> and M. <hi>Stroud,</hi> whereby they are chalenged to be guilty of high treaſon againſt the State, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo opprobriouſly falſe and wicked, that wee humbly deſire your Maieſty to manifeſt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of the ſaid falſe accuſation againſt ſo worthy friends: for it cannot bee otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but that they who ſought to pick holes in the coats of our beſt men, cannot bee free themſelves from blemiſh: whereupon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties anſwer was, that hee would not produce them; but notwithſtanding they ſhould not bee concealed, but manifeſt themſelves as occaſion ſhall ſerve hereafter. But as for the Articles they were called in already cleared to their honor and credit. His Maieſty likewiſe made a motion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the danger of Ireland, and deſired aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by counſell of them for a remedy. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unon the Parliament ſits ever ſince concerning the Iriſh affaires. The Parliament likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated his Maieſties favour concerning ſome courſe to be taken for diſarming the Papiſts in England, at leaſt to quell their ſuperbious riſing to the great affright and diſaſter of the Citie, mentioning thier ſudden commotion about the Parliament houſe, their ioyning with <hi>Digby</hi> and <hi>Lunsford</hi> in hoſtile manner, and their continuall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>eſtering wordes and threates by ſome of
<pb facs="tcp:62148:4"/>
their adherents to the terrour of all his Maieſties loyall ſubiects; his Maieſty was pleaſed to grant this gratious reply, that ſeeing they ſo well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the grievance, they ſhould proceed to provide a remedy, and as he ſhould finde the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion honourable, he would be ready to ſigne to it; the Parliament making it ſo palpably appeare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Recuſants, concerning their ſowing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in his Maieſties Realmes, by endeavouring to ſubvert the fundamentall lawes of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and have endeavoured by many aſperſions upon the Parliament, and its induſtry, to alienate the affection of his Maieſty from Parliaments, and make it ſeeme odious unto him, and are to be ſuſpected, leſt they have invited and encouraged forraigne Nations againſt us, to invade his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Kingdome of England, as well as to detract the Kingdome of Ireland, and endeavour to ſettle it upon their owne faction, by ploting to ſubvert the very ends and being of Parliament. And for compleating their traiterous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, they have endevored as much as in them lay, by their traiterous inſinuations and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to his Maieſty to compell the Parliament to yeeld to their untollerably falſe accuſations, and to ioyne with them in their traiterous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes; and to that end have actually raiſed and countenanced tumults againſt King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for whatſoever is againſt the State, muſt needs entirely concerne his Maieſty. The King being moved with theſe reall inſtigations, gave leave and authority to the Parliament to remove
<pb facs="tcp:62148:4"/>
theſe doubts, as aforeſaid. Theſe are the briefe particulars of his Maieſties favour toward us, whoſe care i beyond expreſſion, whoſe indulgent and laborious endeavours for the ſetling of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and piety, are quotidiall, and whoſe mercies towards us in permitting us to hnioy ſuch hopes of enſuing happineſſe, are exemplary that wee ſhould prove ungratefull unto God, if not to give him the praiſe of inſpiring this influence of grace into his Maieſty; and diſloyall to his Maieſty, if not to extoll his wonderfull bounty; for whoſe honour, long life, and peace upon earth, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glory after death, wee daily pray for now and ever.</p>
            <p>The 22. of this preſent moneth of Ianuary, the Kings Maieſty was deſirous to goe to Wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocke; and to that intent ſent to the Officers of his Carriages to provide for the ſame againſt Munday; who replied, that they durſt not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out commiſſion. Whereupon returning to his Maiſtie, they received commiſſion from him; which they likewiſe denied to obey, becauſe it was not likewiſe authorized by the Parliament, their anſwer was, that without further or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they would ſtirre no further: and that they had rather, and with more alacrity carry him home then carry him further from home. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was left to further conſideration.</p>
