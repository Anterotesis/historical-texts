            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WOrthy Sir; Whileſt others are

I am thankfull for
a friendly one, this in the
meane time being mine happy aduantage
ouer them, that they expect, but I inioy a
Patron. And yet I haue not ſuch a ſcarcity
of great names, to whom I might pretend

debtor) might haue expected, others almoſt
challenged my Dedication: to whom
<pb facs="tcp:3460:4"/>
I know no other anſwer of more reſpect and
ſatisfaction then this, that I concluded
the worke to bee below their notice,
how much more their protection; and that
I would haue others to take notice more of
my Friendſhip, then of my Ambition: But it
may be that ſome will conceiue an Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in this Friendſhip, when I of ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
in ſtudy ſhall boaſt the fauours of ſo
growne a vertue, and intrude vpon his fame.
If this be an offence, I muſt profeſſe I glory
in it, this accuſation I confeſſe and am proud
of: ſuch is the ambition of him that is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
on vertue, of the man who would
be indeared to heauen; whoſe deſires would
not be ſo good, were they not ſo high, and
the Angels might ſtill haue ſtood, had theye
neuer knowne another Pride. But not to
inſiſt on that (which neuertheleſſe I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
too much inſiſt on, the remembrance of
our friendſhip) to whom could I more fitly
dedicate a Poem, then to him that hath
ſhewed ſuch excellency? or a Diuine Poem,
then to him that hath ſhewed ſuch Religion
in his compoſures? Of this truth <hi>Perſius</hi> is
a witneſſe, whom you haue taught to ſpeake
Engliſh with ſuch a grace, that wee can vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
when we heare him, and find no
<pb facs="tcp:3460:4"/>
one ſyllable in his Dialect offenſiue either to
the Elegant, or to the Chaſt Eare. Of this
truth <hi>Iuvenall</hi> may bee a witneſſe, whom
though we doe not yet heare in publike bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
his expreſſions by your exact rendring
him, yet they that haue inioy'd the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of your neerer friendſhip, confidently
and vpon the hazard of their vnderſtanding
affirme, that hee is farre vnworthy of ſuch an
impriſonment, that he ſhould bee obſcured
by that hand which cleared him. But it is
Diuinity that is the ſubiect of theſe verſes,
and it is Diuinity which is the exerciſe, and
glory of your ſtudies, which makes you an
inhabitant of the Pulpit, nay which makes
euery place where you will vouchſafe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
to be a pulpit, for ſuch is the bounty
of your religious conuerſation, that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the place may be changed, the Sermon is
perpetuall. Sermons that at the ſame time
make vs deuout and witty, which by firſt
winning the Preacher, haue the eaſier Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of the Auditory: who are neuer with
leſſe difficulty intreated to their happineſſe,
then when they ſee they doe not goe alone.
So that now when I conſider what I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and to whom, I beginne to ſuſpect the
lightneſſe of my worke, and thinke I haue
<pb facs="tcp:3460:5"/>
ſome reaſon to feare the cenſure of ſuch a
Friend, to whom if I ſhall bee excus'd, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
ſome glory from others, not becauſe the
Leuite, but becauſe He was mine; to whom,
hauing thus farre tryed his patience, I haue
nothing more to adde but this, that I am his,</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>REader, I muſt firſt intreat thy Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
afterward thy Ingenuity; thy
Patience, that thou wilt read ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
before my verſes: thy Ingenuity,
that thou wilt not cenſure the worſe of them,
becauſe thou ſhalt find them cenſur'd to thy
hand. The purpoſe of this Poem is Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Delight, which if thou ſhalt find in any
place wanting, or disjoynd, vnderſtand, that it
was either not my intent, or mine Error. And yet
I dare affirme no man ſhall be the worſe by it, and
that if there be any want, it is more of the Delight
then of the Religion: If I intended excuſes I
could tell you, and that truely too, that theſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
were not now firſt made, although they are
now firſt publiſhed, and the Compoſure was a
yonger mans, though the Edition be a Diuines.
This I could ſay, if I thought Poetry incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with Diuinity, if it were a ſerious truth, that
God could bee onely magnified in Proſe: But
when I conſider that <hi>Nazianzen</hi> could be both a
Poet, and a Saint, and that it was hereſie that
caſt <hi>Tertullian</hi> out of the Church, and not his
Verſes. I dare acknowledge theſe for mine owne
<pb facs="tcp:3460:6"/>
and feare not to ſuffer in that cauſe, wherein
thoſe Worthies were ſo magnify'd: Eſpecially,
ſince theſe Eſſayes (which I feare their weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
will too ſtrongly teſtifie) were not my ſtudy,
but my Recreation when in the vacations hauing
for a time intermitted my more ſerious affaires
I choſe Poetry before Idleneſſe; yet I haue not
choſe Poetry with the hazard of my Conſcience,
and ſo in ſtead of a Diuine haue writ a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
worke; howſoeuer Malice or Ignorance
may wreſt a paſſage vnto Popery; I meane that,
where <hi>Abraham</hi> prayes for the victory of the
Iſraelites: But beſides that the Interceſſion is
generall for the Church, which no iudicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
but will allow for Orthodox, it is made by
him, whom a Popiſh Diuine will deny at that
time to be able to intercede: there was no ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
of him they ſaw not, and God they did not
ſee (as they would tell you) till after the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion:
I haue the more fully expreſt my ſelfe
in this, becauſe I would not be eſteem'd as one of
them (whereof there is now too great an harueſt)
who play the wantons with Religion, that will
halt betweene two parties, and in ſpite of the
Prophet, at the ſame time ſcrue God and Baal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who like not Orthodoxe truth, vnleſſe deliuered
in hereticall termes, and ſo by a notable new trick
of Iuggling, call that Pacification, which is
<pb facs="tcp:3460:6"/>
Conſpiracy; of whoſe proficiency in Religion I can
ſpeake little; but this I may moſt confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that (perhaps not after the Apoſtles
mind, yet certainely in his words) they goe on
from Faith, to Faith. Of this crime, and of the
ſuſpition of it, I truſt I am ſufficiently acquitted:
for other errors which Malice and Curioſity will
aboundantly multiply, I onely referre my ſelfe to
the truely Iudicious, who know that a good Poem
is as a good Life, not wherein there are none, but
wherein there are the feweſt faults.</p>

            <l>Feele I theſe flames through my glad ſoule to ruſh!</l>
            <l>Life thoſe, which made a Chappell of the buſh</l>
            <l>VVhen God did tutor <hi>Moſes;</hi> would 'twere found</l>
            <l>That this place too were ſuch an holy ground:</l>
            <l>Then ſhould I boldly vent my Gratitude,</l>
            <l>And being Godly, not be counted Rude.</l>
            <l>The Night approacht, when by my paines I might</l>
            <l>Suſpect it would haue been my laſting Night:</l>
            <l>I had a griefe beyond a Cowards feares,</l>
            <l>And ſuch a griefe, it robb'd me of my teares.</l>
            <l>I was all Fire, the greedy element</l>
            <l>Left no one part vnſing'd, as if it meant</l>
            <l>To croſſe the vulgar notions of our birth,</l>
            <l>And proue that man was not compos'd of Earth,</l>
            <l>That he was made of Flames, that paſt all doubt</l>
            <l>To dye was nothing, but to be put out.</l>
            <l>And yet the truth of this, this truth denyes,</l>
            <l>Man is not made of that by which he dyes.</l>
            <l>And had I dy'd thus, they had beene vniuſt</l>
            <l>VVho had pronounc'd, we giue duſt vnto duſt.</l>
            <l>Aſhes they well might tearme me, and ſo turne</l>
            <l>My Chriſtian buriall to a Pagan vine.</l>
            <l>VVithout a tedious pilgrimage to <hi>Rome,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>(If that the torment make the Martyrdome)</l>

            <l>Burne in red letters, of whom none can tell</l>

            <l>Euer we liſt we may be good, and ſo</l>
            <l>Owe to our ſelues as well the Cure as Blow?</l>
            <l>Who gaue vs this ſtrange power, can any tell,</l>
            <l>Not to be Bad, and yet not to be Well?</l>
            <l>Can we command our ſinnes ſo eaſily,</l>

            <l>You will conſent to dye? and wherefore ſtill</l>
            <l>You plead not then a liberty of will?</l>
            <l>My God cry'd I, though I muſt needs confeſſe</l>
            <l>Vnto my ſhame, that all my paines are leſſe</l>
            <l>Then my demerits, yet I grant as free</l>

            <l>Then my Redeemer, thou alone canſt doe</l>
            <l>A powerfull cure on ſoule and body too.</l>
            <l>With that I felt recouery: my flame</l>
            <l>Was kindly leſſen'd to a lower name,</l>
            <l>To moderate heat. Sleepe did my ſenſes charme,</l>

            <l>Health and Deuotion ceize on me, my fire</l>
            <l>Had leſt my bones to liue in my Deſire,</l>
