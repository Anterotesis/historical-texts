            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

at laſt blurts out all.

Well, he was a wealthy old <hi>Batchelor,</hi> and my <hi>good genius</hi> did ſo farre collogue with his, that without entreaty he promiſt to diſcharge the Pariſh of my <hi>Perſon</hi> within a weeke: his <hi>action</hi> purſued his <hi>promiſe</hi> too, as faſt as a good Horſe could bring it to me, and me to him.

               </argument>
               <p>THe World had not owned me full one and twenty years when my good <hi>Patron</hi> dyed; being old, &amp; rich: but too well ſtored with <hi>Kinſmen;</hi> there were more NIMS beſides my ſelfe.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106928:8"/>
am pleaſed to extract him a ſecond <hi>life,</hi> from the true relation of the manner of his <hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He lay ſick of a <hi>burning Fever</hi> a long time, his death being deferred more for the <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians gaine,</hi> then his <hi>eaſe,</hi> or probability of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recovering: A <hi>neceſſary</hi> knavery in them, and <hi>Lawyers,</hi> to make men give money for paine and trouble.

               <p>His ſick <hi>Groans</hi> accompanying his words, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued (me-thought) with what an ill will he parted from thoſe <hi>gifts,</hi> and how ſorry he was, he could not make his ſoul <hi>Executor.</hi> A great minde he had to erect an <hi>Almes-houſe</hi> for <hi>decayed Souldiers:</hi> but a poore benefic'd <hi>Parſon</hi> (who ſtood by) ſmothers in his owne <hi>particular</hi> want, the knowledg of that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous height which <hi>generally</hi> his <hi>Tribe</hi> live in, and ſtrives by the force of <hi>zealous phraſe,</hi> to make himſelf <hi>diſpoſer</hi> of anothers <hi>Charity:</hi> pleading how much the building of a <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> with allowance for Twenty <hi>Fellowes,</hi> would encreaſe <hi>Learning,</hi> and memorize the noble <hi>Given.</hi> The <hi>Phyſitian</hi> (who till now ſat ſilent on the Bed) ſpeakes in approbation of

The Parſon being croſs'd, fell from <hi>modeſt</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to <hi>impious</hi> rayling, and mixing <hi>ſerious abſurditie,</hi> with a <hi>leaden witt</hi> he bandies <hi>Jeſts:</hi> amongſt the reſt this one was noted, becauſe he laught at it him ſelfe.

               <p>But now returne we to my ſick <hi>Patron,</hi> who hearing his charitable motion begot ſuch ſtriffe, concludes <hi>negatively</hi> both waies: and preſently after, loſt the uſe of both his Eyes, denoting it with a piercing ſhreek, whilſt we that were in the Chamber (amaz'd at ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den an alteration) tire the Collerick <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> with abſur'd queſtions.

of a Lad that went to ſeek his Fortunes.

Juſt ſuch a one encounter'd with my converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: who fed my Ears with relating, what I have here ſet down.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:106928:15"/>Two <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Gentlemen, Friends, and worthy of <hi>Fortunes</hi> envy, were both their ruines of her Conqueſt; expreſt in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtream impoveriſhment: which forc'd <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to beget diſhoneſt ſhifts. So much doth <hi>Equivocating</hi> Neceſſity <hi>ridle</hi> in her Actions; <hi>baſely</hi> preventing baſe living: amongſt the reſt, this one arrives to our knowledge.</p>
               <p>A certain rich <hi>Creditor</hi> of theirs rode into <hi>Oxford-ſhire,</hi> about a Purchaſe he had lately bought: Theſe <hi>Gallants</hi> (hearing of it) plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted now to enrich themſelves by his return; at laſt agreed, that ſix of their Companions, ſhould ſet upon him on the high-way; diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling as if they entended not only to rob him of his Money, but alſo of his life: Whilſt they two (appearing to ride that way by chance) fight ſtoutly in his defence, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Victory, by putting the reſt to flight; not doubting, but this being carried too cloſe for his diſcovery, might move him <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> to conſider their <hi>counterfeit</hi> kindneſſe, in a large requitall. He had no Kinſman on whom his love could beſtow the keeping of his Purſe-ſtrings to a peculiar profit; which ſtrengthned their hopes. Having by a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent enquirie got to know the time of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, they all attended him under a Hill; three Miles diſtant from Town or Village. One of the Six ſerv'd as <hi>Scout,</hi> to prevent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106928:16"/>
both by diſcovering his coming, and the paſſing by of others. But the Coaſt was clear, and the <hi>Sun</hi> almoſt ſet, when they behel'd their <hi>Creditor,</hi> walking down a Hill; ſinging of <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> attended on only by wone Man, who ſeem'd furniſh'd with two defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Weapons; an old ruſty Sword, and a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall Hand: not to ſtrike, but to give away his Purſe, which was his politique device, to prevent robbing. Well, if he had valour in him, he was affraid to ſhew it: beſides it dwelt at leaſt a furlong from his face; for the <hi>cowardly</hi> form of that could not but encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage an Enemy. The Six preſently (upon a watch-word) aſſault them from behind a Hedge. <hi>Stand, deliver your Purſe?</hi> are words of no force here: the Maſter being old, weak, and unable to <hi>ſupport</hi> his fear, fell down to <hi>complement</hi> with their mercy. The Servant (being lightned by flinging them his Purſe) ran away: but they (leſt he ſhould have rais'd a <hi>hue-on-cry</hi>) brought him back again faſt bound. Now pleads the old Man for his life, his <hi>Prodigall</hi> fear offering <hi>Emperors</hi> ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes: whilſt they ſeem to abandon all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, crying <hi>blood, blood!</hi> the Villain will reveal us, the Villain will reveal us. He ſwears by all oaths extant in his memory, he never will. But by this time his two <hi>Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> ſallied forth, ſaying, what noiſe is that?
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106928:16"/>
keep the Kings peace ho! and calling him by his name, they cheere him up with comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table words, and counterfeit blows, which were received by the ſuppoſed Thieves, with as little hurt as <hi>Cowards</hi> could wiſh for. The old Man (doubtfull of the ſucceſſe) conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſuch an advantage on the adverſe parties ſide; ſwore thoſe Six Gentlemen, to be his <hi>honeſt</hi> Friends, and what they did, was but in jeaſt: thinking if the other two were overcome, this would ſave his life. But it was their Qu' now to fly, as vanquiſh'd by two oppoſers, which they did with exquiſite diſſimulation; carrying along with them Fiveteen Pounds. Our two Gallants are yet to receive the Fruit of their labours: The old Man having nought about him now to beſtow upon them, but thanks, which they <hi>ſeem'd</hi> to receive in ample ſatisfaction; He earneſtly enquires after his Man, whom they all <hi>ſmelt</hi> out preſently, by reaſon of an <hi>immodeſt</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Fear: offenſive to their Noſes, and his own Breeches. It prov'd ſomthing trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to unbind him, for every man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd one of his Hands to ſtop his Noſtrills withall. At laſt (with much adoe) they all became Horſemen again, and rode a pace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the next Town: he being very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſend <hi>hu-on-cry</hi> after them for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but by the force of premeditated rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106928:17"/>
he was perſwaded to the contrary They had ſcarce enter'd their <hi>Inne,</hi> but he relates unto a publique Auditory what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto him, ſtill interpoſing between his own danger, the Valour and kindneſſe of thoſe two Gentlemen, his <hi>Debtors.</hi> But they ſtrengthen their well compoſed plot with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that he moſt ' valiantly behav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before they could come to his reſcue. <hi>Flatterie</hi> (that old ſiin) agrees beſt with <hi>Age,</hi> where <hi>Folly</hi> is grown out of her own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and oft miſtakes her ſelf for <hi>Wiſdom:</hi> the implication of the word, being loſt, when apply'd to Men of full deſert. It is a <hi>poor</hi> beggerly vice, yet ſtill accompanies the rich. It is a Thiefe that ſteals away the <hi>Heart</hi> through the <hi>Ear,</hi> and for that <hi>theft</hi> hangs on it like a <hi>Jewel</hi> ever after. It works the <hi>Soul</hi> from a <hi>compudent</hi> giving to a <hi>doating</hi> prodigality; and hath <hi>caught</hi> this man too: who though his knowledge <hi>bluſht</hi> in what it knew, and gave the <hi>Lie</hi> to his own <hi>forc'd</hi> belief; yet did he hugg a ſecond <hi>Youth</hi> within him, and talkt of what he could do, ſetting aſide great advantage: <hi>non Hercules contra duos.</hi> The next Morning they rode to his Houſe; where <hi>thanks,</hi> and <hi>welcome</hi> did no more appear <hi>ſhap't</hi> in words, but in little Baggs of Money, which were delivered with a courtlike entreaty of acceptance: he ſtriving to prove, there was no
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106928:17"/>
diſparagement in the receipt of them. Their old Bonds likewiſe he freely reſtor'd ſaying, Since <hi>Fortune</hi> (who is <hi>blind</hi> to all mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts) could not ſee theirs, he was glad this occaſion had given <hi>Eies</hi> to his Duty, that can direct him on whom he may ſtill beſtow, yet never impoveriſh himſelf. They had what they deſir'd, and therefore pretended buſineſs which muſt needs occaſion their departure from him. His humour is ſtill conſtant to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie</hi> in kindneſſe, and ſtaies them to Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, where there was good <hi>Cheer</hi> and <hi>Mirth.</hi> But by and by one knocks at the Gate, whoſe entrance being licenc'd, he ask'd for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Houſe; the Servants perceiv'd him to be drunk, therefore deny'd at firſt their Maſter was at home: Well, anon the old Man riſes from Dinner to know his buſineſſe. After a little complement between them, this drunken Gentleman diſcovers himſelf to be one of thoſe Six men that robb'd him, and beggs his pardon for it, which being granted, he reveals' likewiſe the whole drift of thoſe two Champions, who are now his Gueſts. <hi>Owles</hi> (as they were) to truſt a ſecret in a <hi>Drunkards</hi> Breaſt, whoſe love to the <hi>taſt</hi> of Wine, ſeats his <hi>Heart</hi> upon his <hi>Palat,</hi> which being ſo near his Tongue, he cannot chuſe but ſpeak his <hi>Thoughts.</hi> He (poor man) was ſtruck with a <hi>fretfull</hi> admiration; yet thought

it not a fit time to lowre now, being divers of his Friends were there at Dinner with them, who (unleſſe they could <hi>digeſt</hi> his Looks) would <hi>ſtomach</hi> his Meat in a diſpleaſing Senſe: therefore contriv'd a way to end all with merriment. Six of his Servants he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to robb the two Gentlemen in his <hi>Parlour,</hi> of what he had beſtow'd upon them, counterfeiting likewiſe an intent to kil them: whilſt he, and his <hi>Shit-breech</hi> Man, ſhould come in (as it were by chance) and ſave their Lives.

               <p>Such Tales as theſe baniſht tedious <hi>Time,</hi> and penſive conſideration, till wee arriv'd at <hi>Mayden-head,</hi> Twenty two Miles diſtant from London; where was an <hi>Inne</hi> preferd to my acceptance by my <hi>Cyttizens</hi> commendations, who knew the Servants Names, as well as if he had binne their <hi>Godfather,</hi> though the Howſe never ownde his company but one Night: men of his Coate deſiring much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, becauſe they will loſe by none.

All his owne proceedings (in Eight yeares Prentiſhip) he related to me. How long he bore the <hi>water-Tankard,</hi> ſcrapt Trenchers, and made cleane Shooes: diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering a ſelfe-admiration, that ſuch mean Offices could bring him to the height which now he lives at. Next he reported how many Servants he keeps; upon what conditions he hath bought the leaſe of his Howſe: how long his father, and himſelfe have liv'd in that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106928:19"/>
Pariſh, and what Offices they have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne, with divers other things impertinent to any Mans knowledge: not omitting to reveale (in a grave manner) how unworthy he was to be Conſtable, or <hi>Church-Warden,</hi> would willingly have fined for it, but the Pariſh (forſooth) did more need his Advice, then Money. After Supper he expreſſ't his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie (in being from home) with a <hi>diſtracted Mirth,</hi> as if he were ſuddenly to recover ſo much of his Heart blood, as he hath ſigh'd away, when pennd within the Citty Walls, It is a certaine obſervation; They are the <hi>civileſt</hi> at <hi>home,</hi> and rudeſt being abroad.</p>
               <p>But now my Hoſt and his Wife came both up to <hi>stay</hi> and taulke with us.

               <p>I had no friends in the Citty but my Gold, which I eſteem'd ſo much, that I made it Bed-fellow to my Thoughts. Yet there
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106928:21"/>
was a Marchant who hath ſworne heretofore he lov'd me, but how? as. Wiſe men love Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; for the uſe of it. Whilſt my Patron liv'd, I could have done him a courteſie; but now the caſe was alter'd, and therefore his friendſhip <hi>dead.</hi> Neither did the place ever harbor any acquaintance of mine, beſides him, but only one Man (a <hi>Cambridge</hi> Scholler) whom envious Death tooke from me at <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne;</hi> he was <hi>brought</hi> to that fatall end by a <hi>Cart,</hi> though indeed the main occaſion was his unfortunate Luſt. Let not the <hi>Reader,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me of tedious digreſſion from our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if I relate the manner of it.</p>
               <p>His violent Love ſeaſd upon the Beauty of an <hi>Inkeepers</hi> Daughter, who was thirty yeares old, and a Mayde: her Chaſtitie being <hi>ſtarv'd</hi> for want of <hi>naturall</hi> conſideration: and her Fort vanquiſht, by an <hi>unboned Member</hi> (the <hi>Tongue</hi>) for that, that is it, which charmes a Womans credulous minde to beleeve, what ſhe dares not <hi>feele,</hi> and feele becauſe tis more delightfull then to <hi>beleeve:</hi> let it ſuffice, the Scholler often <hi>knew</hi> her in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> phraſe. One Night amongſt the reſt, ſhe (being enflam'd with a covetous love, futurly to owne his Perſon, and eſtate as a Wife) contriv'd a way how her father, and Mother might (as if by chance) come into the Chamber, and finde them in the midſt of

                  <hi>immodeſt</hi> action, ſo afterwards enforce him to marry her.

From out the Bed he leaps (untam'd with his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous combat) faſtens on his good Sword, which bravely he advances in defiance. Her <hi>devided</hi> Spirits being ſent abroad, <hi>ſeverally</hi> to withſtand <hi>Feare,</hi> and <hi>Shame,</hi> ſhe creeps betweene the Sheets, and winks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a true Coward! whoſe ſenſeleſſe imagination com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the protection of his whole Body to his Eie-lids, and bullwarks it with cloſing them, as though he can <hi>feele</hi> nothing but what he <hi>ſees.</hi> The Mother (running forth to cry for helpe) is intercepted, by intercepting the Doore. The father ſtrives with a Ioynt ſtoole to beate him thence, which he by meere ſtrength tooke from him, but with looſing the forepart of his Shirt, the loſſe of which got under his ſubjection the old Woman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who bluſhing to behold his <hi>manhood,</hi> ranne (as frighted) behind the Bed, whilſt he <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſtly</hi> (though for <hi>modeſtys</hi> ſake) turn'd his Breech towards them, and ſought back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The ſcufle grew now hot, and lowde; therefore he (fearing it might wake the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants) ſwore if he once more turn'd his face, he would kill them all, which made them quieter. His Doublet, and Stockings being

neereſt his reach; were put on; in two How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſpace, not ſooner; becauſe his right Hand was wholly imploy'd to manage his Sword: leaſt the father (advantaged by any thing) might recover the Doore. The Mother came backwards to deliver him his Breeches, and ſo by chance ſtumbled over a Stoole; her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Eies look'd <hi>red</hi> as fire, ſome thought with anger, but ſure I think they <hi>bluſht</hi> to behold that, which made him put out the Candle.

O Wine! good for none but the fiery Zwitzer, who loves to have his face, richer then his Purſe: thou that <hi>ridleſt</hi> in operation, and makes this Drunkard happy by depriving him of ſenſe, for though his bare Breech kiſſ'd the cold ſtones, he ſlept ſowndly: whilſt our Scholler (walking

through the neighbour Street) is taken by a Watch. The parlous Conſtable (ſpying how unhanſom he was dreſt) ſuſpected him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſome bawdy buſineſſe, and laughing ſufficiently at him, ſent him to the <hi>Counter.</hi> But one ſorrow treads upon the Heel of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother (ſo ſwift are they in purſuit, when once running to us) the way to the <hi>Counter</hi> is through that Lane where the Drunkard was, who by this time had recovered his ſenſes, and walk'd ſhivering up and down, in ſearch of his Breeches. The <hi>Watch-men</hi> ſpying his white Shirt) ſtood ſtill, ſuppoſing him to be a <hi>Ghoſt.</hi> The Scholler perceiv'd his theft would be diſcover'd; yet was loath to run away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe loath to be taken by another Watch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he lik'd this ſo ill.

In the name of God (quoth he) what art thou? whence doſt thou come? what makeſt thou here? he anſwered, he was not himſelf half an Hour ago, but now he is a Man as others are; of Gods making; only ſome Villain had ſtoln away his Breeches.

               <p>Thoſe whom I firſt rail'd at, were Men of my own calling (<hi>Satyriſts</hi>) a new device, therefore likely to be approv'd of in this new World: wherein old waies are ſcorn'd; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>accuſtomary:</hi> though in the golden time, <hi>Cuſtom</hi> enjoy'd more able ſtrength then <hi>Law,</hi> was upheld by <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it ſelf without vain-glory.

               <p>The ſecond foyld off <hi>coorſe</hi> phraſe, and <hi>rugged</hi> Rime, with a ſawcy impudence: his ambitious Pen (made ſurely of an <hi>Eagles</hi> Quill) <hi>ſoar'd</hi> to reach the actions of great States-Men-<hi>Cynicall</hi> behaviour, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the rough, unfaſhionable rudiments of a Souldiers life, made him appear in our <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beions</hi> apprehenſion (whoſe dull <hi>gueſſing</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can only cenſure by the outſide) the thing which he had not wit enough to be.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>A Certain young Gentlewoman (enrîcht with a compudent Portion by her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſod Fathers Will) grew <hi>carnally</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a wealthy <hi>Ward:</hi> one that did not long enjoy her to himſelf, becauſe he was not alwaies ſufficiently provided to pleaſe her inſatiable Appetite: for 'tis with Maids as with <hi>Tobacconiſts,</hi> who having once <hi>taſted</hi> in <hi>delight,</hi> what before with <hi>Pain</hi> they did <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void,</hi> they cannot live without it: which made her ſtray for freſh paſture. At laſt her Fancy lighted on a <hi>Drummer,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Peel:</hi> a Fellow limm'd for <hi>prodigality</hi> in <hi>action:</hi> made to <hi>people</hi> Countries, to beget more Men, then the <hi>Plague</hi> devours. Her greedy Paſſion could not attend upon <hi>formality,</hi> or tedious Time, till <hi>Occaſion</hi> might preſent her with an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that would excuſo her <hi>immodeſty,</hi> in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering ſuch <hi>diſhoneſt</hi> Love: but boldly ſhe ſends for him to her Fathers Houſe, where firſt ſhe ſaw him (in the company of a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-man</hi>)
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106928:41"/>
and unfolds to him her mind, which he admir'd, and likld: ſo that the next Morning he ſtole her from her Friends, brought her to <hi>London,</hi> and married her. The <hi>ward</hi> hears of it, purſues them thither; and by a politique inquiſition found out their Lodging. Of late time ſhe had made his foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh dotage her mirth, wherefore now he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſhe ſhall be ſerved with the like Sawce: purpoſing to ſend her a Copy of Verſes, wherein he would bitterly deride, her &amp; <hi>Peel</hi> the <hi>Drummer.</hi> Of theſe Verſes I became Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor by this chance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bunge</hi> paſſing through Fleet-Street about my buſineſſe, met with an old Maſter of his, who accompany'd the <hi>Ward,</hi> and hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore been: viſited with my Papers.

               <p>Theſe being fairly written; <hi>Bunge</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd unto the young <hi>wards</hi> Lodging, who was privately inform'd, that the <hi>Drummer,</hi> and his Wife knew of his being in Town, therefore (to avoid his company) chang'd their aboade: but whither went they? even into <hi>Turnball</hi>-Street: juſt the politique ſhift of a poor Souldier, whoſe <hi>neceſſity</hi> is ſo well accommodated, with <hi>convenient</hi> aſſiſtance, to raiſe him to the height of a good Fortune, that he often <hi>falls</hi> in <hi>climing,</hi> but ſo low, as he can never reach it again. The Houſe was pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with a <hi>bawdy</hi> Tenant: whoſe acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance my <hi>Drummer</hi> bought dearly on a Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Night: reeling into the Door with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106928:43"/>
of baſe Companions. His love-ſick Wife was eaſily perſwaded to believe the <hi>Rawd</hi> his Mothers own Siſter: and the place very convenient to conceal this ſtoln Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Now thoſe who before enform'd the <hi>ward</hi> of their firſt lodging, <hi>dogg'd</hi> them alſo to this, and preſently brought him word, in what a ſtately Palace the poor <hi>Drummer</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd her. Out of a <hi>politique</hi> prodigalitie he gave <hi>Bunge</hi> three Pounds for the Verſes: thinking to buy a <hi>gratitude</hi> ſo potent in him, that he ſhould ſuppoſe no ſecond ſervice full in requitall, no though he ventured a beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by it. So whilſt the Gentleman (<hi>Bungs</hi> old Maſter) entertain'd him with impertient diſcourſe, the <hi>ward</hi> enclos'd the Verſes in an other Paper, which he ſeal'd and ſuperſcrib'd in the true name of his <hi>quondam</hi> Miſtreſſe, lodging at the Sign of <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball</hi>-Street: knowing, though <hi>Bunge</hi> had heard of the name of <hi>Peel,</hi> yet with hers he was wholly unacquainted: beſides to prevent all motives of ſuſpition, he gave it him in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; ſaying, we are all mortall, Fleſh and Blood: Young men muſt be tamed when they are luſty. I am now <hi>ſick</hi> of <hi>too much health,</hi> but that ſuperſcription wil direct thee to a shee <hi>Galon,</hi> one that will purge the Body of all <hi>rampant</hi> humours: wholſom ſhe is, though poor.

came within the ſmell of a City, never ſaw the Cities Face; much leſſe the <hi>ſecret parts</hi> of it, therefore is unfit to be employ'd in this buſineſſe. Now if thou wilt go, and bring her to me, by the virtue of that Letter, I ſhall exceed in a gratuity: but make haſte back, for you muſt preſently alſo aſſiſt us in the delivery of our Verſes. The Rogue <hi>Bunge</hi> ſuſpected nothing, but did <hi>impudently</hi> ſteal a <hi>modeſt</hi> laughter: turn'd aſide, not as if he were aſhamed of what he heard, but of what he was about to ſpeak: Quoth he (as though <hi>loſt</hi> in <hi>complement</hi>) O Lord Sir! you ſhall not need to take care for that neceſſarie implement: I'le provide one againſt Night; but not out of <hi>Turnball</hi>-Street: that place cannot afford a Creature worthy your Worſhips embraces. The <hi>ward</hi> was glad that he inſiſted in ſtrengthning a miſtake, thank'd him for his kindneſſe, and ſaid he would uſe none but her: he knew ſhe was wholſome, but many of your brave, glorious <hi>whores</hi> are like <hi>Tedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> Quinces; the fairer on the outſide, the rotner within. <hi>Bunge</hi> being greedy of ſudden imployment, took his leave, well ſatisfied with that reply.</p>
               <p>He vvas no ſooner come vvithin the reach of their Tongues, vvho border in that hot Continent: but every one (as their faſhion is) lured him into their Kennell, there to coole
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106928:44"/>
him according to a <hi>Philoſophicall</hi> rule, <hi>Heat expells Heat.</hi> The Sunne attracts not Cloudes faſter then theſe Whores Paſſengers: in vvhom <hi>Beauty</hi> dravves <hi>corruption</hi> to defile it ſelfe. <hi>Bunge</hi> needed not enquire for the ſigne of the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moone,</hi> becauſe the properties of both (<hi>heate</hi> and <hi>inconſtancie</hi>) did poſſeſſe a Wench, which ſtood in the ſame Doore: and thinking that he was ſome <hi>ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> Cuſtomer, enticed him to enter: vvhilſt his Eies looking on the ſigne; found it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient her requeſt ſhould be accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>After two Oathes ſworne in defiance of her <hi>ſecret-parts,</hi> and three Buſſes given in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for ſuch <hi>honeſt</hi> unkindneſſe; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires for that Gentlewoman, to whom his Letter was directed. The Whore being wholly unperfect in the knowledg of her Name, did expreſſe (by a forgetfull admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or an <hi>inquiſitive</hi> forgetfullneſſe) ſmall acquaintance; and that very <hi>young</hi> to: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bunge</hi> thought the Gentlewoman to be a wanton Country Wench, but not yet of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence long enough to know the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſeaſe: a rare ignorance!</hi> which made his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite reſolve to taſte her, before him, that ſent him to her. Up Staires he mounted, and the Wench led him through a <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of darke Cloſſers: which the Workman ſeem'd <hi>ſubtitly</hi> to hide from his owne diſcovery: or
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106928:44"/>
from every Eie, as aſhamed to acknowledge the making of ſuch ſinfull Cabinets; where aged. Beds oppoſe each other in envious ſeituation. Having (I ſay) paſſed this <hi>reall</hi> Purgatory, ſhe directed him to a Chamber; wherein he entered, and found the <hi>Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and his Laſſe <hi>warming</hi> the Fire. Beleeve it Reader, even ſo: for though the Fire would not warme them, they ſat by it to keepe away the Winde, or to encloſe the heate to a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row diſperſion, that ſo it might reflect upon it ſelfe. Though t'is a queſtion whether there were any Fire at all? for <hi>Bunge</hi> ſvvore he could not <hi>diſcerne</hi> enough to <hi>warme</hi> his Eies. Which makes me think ſhe was enflamed with <hi>burning</hi> Love, that for his ſake could be content of ſuch <hi>cold</hi> entertainment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bunge</hi> liked her face well, but ſuppoſ'd the <hi>Drummer</hi> to be ſome learned <hi>Pander;</hi> that ſat expounding to her, the myſtery of that call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When he ſtep'd in, they both <hi>ſtood up</hi> (an uſuall complement at the firſt ſight of Strangers) and gazeing upon one another with <hi>ſpeaking</hi> Eies; did (as it were) <hi>dumbly</hi> aſke, whether he vvere knowne to either? vvhilſt he took her aſide and kiſſ'd her. The <hi>Drummer</hi> did not like that, yet durſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe anger, leſt a Quarrell might call up the <hi>Bawde,</hi> and Whores; ſo conſequently, his Wife diſcover the conditions of the Houſe,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106928:45"/>
who was yet ignorant of them. But this his ſufferance did turne <hi>Bunge's</hi> likely conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (that ſhe was a Country Whore) into a ſtrong beliefe: for now he convayes her with an <hi>intreated</hi> force, and the mentioning of a Letter, into the next Chamber: <hi>Peeles</hi> creepes after them in ſearch of the event, and faſtening his Eie in a Key-hole; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved <hi>Bunge</hi> labouring to make him Cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old: whilſt the Gentlewoman oppoſ'd his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, more with a new <hi>wonder,</hi> then an old <hi>defence,</hi> as ſhreekes, or loud acclamations.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Souldier</hi> loſt his <hi>Patience,</hi> but with a <hi>conſidering.</hi> Eie <hi>found</hi> it againe: yet ſo <hi>thred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare</hi> that he ſcorn'd to <hi>weare</hi> it. Therefore through the Dores he went: demanding him, how he durſt offer his Perſon that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace? <hi>Bunge</hi> knew no ſafer anſwer then a deniall: &amp; ſuppoſ'd by theſe proceedings that <hi>Peele</hi> was ſome blunt Gentleman, who had lately undertaken to be her Lover. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deprives his Pocket of the Letter, and gave it her: telling him, how he knew the Gentlewoman would acknowledge him better wellcome, when ſhe had read that.</p>
               <p>Thus whilſt he retyr'd him ſelfe aſſide, in conſideration how he might enjoy her Body, they unſealed the Letter: found that blanke, but the Paper therein encloſed, fill'd with Verſes. <hi>Peele</hi> being loath to degenerat from
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106928:45"/>
his Brethren of the Sword (who in this kind love to expreſſe more <hi>will,</hi> then they can <hi>abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie</hi>) undertooke to read them: but indeed could not in any reaſonable time. And ſpying his own name by chance, was greedy to underſtand the cauſe of its being there, reſolving to tickle <hi>Bunge</hi> below, becauſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her help was joyn'd to his, he deſcried the wrong, and entreated her to ſtay there: leaſt <hi>Bunge</hi> (urging the baſe cuſtom of the Houſe for his excuſe) might diſgrace him for bringing her to ſuch a Lodging. But ſhe, poore Soul, was willing to be commanded, whilſt <hi>Bunge</hi> at his entreaty, and promiſe to anſwer the Letter, walks with him downe the Staires. Having deſcended one Paire, <hi>Bunge</hi> entreated him to diſpatch the Letter in the next Chamber: in the meane time he would goe up, and diſcourſe with her about it: for he remembred now he was ſo commanded by the Gentleman that ſent him. <hi>Peeles</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers itch'd to be at his face: but the Roome being towards the Street, agreed not with that purpoſe. Therefore he entreated him to viſit the Celler: where (quoth he) having drunke a Health to the Gentleman, you ſhall goe up and commit your pleaſure. The phraſe lik'd him well; ſo down they went. Juſt upon their entring into the Seller Dore,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106928:46"/>
                  <hi>Bung</hi> deſired to be acquainted with his name that he might tell the <hi>VVard</hi> to whom he was ſo much beholding. He anſwered, his name was <hi>Peel,</hi> by profeſſion a poor <hi>Drummer:</hi> at w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> 
                  <hi>Bung</hi> ſtep'd back whilſt his Breech made as many Buttons, as he thought to have broke with drinking. His reſcue (which moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly conſiſted in the dexterity of his Heels) was barr'd from him by Five ſtrong Dores. Therefore he pulls up his Spirits, even unto his Tongue: thinking to fright the <hi>Drummer</hi> with <hi>big</hi> words.</p>
               <p>Juſt in ſuch a Celler as this (quoth he) this—let me ſee a little—I, in ſuch a one as this, did my weak Arm beat Nine <hi>Rogues;</hi> that would needs enforce me to pledg my Enemies Health.

               </argument>
               <p>IN our way of relating <hi>Bung's</hi> revenge, I hold it requiſte to paſſe through <hi>Turnbal</hi>-Street: and there <hi>admire</hi> (<hi>Cuſtom</hi>) which is to be <hi>ignorant</hi> in <hi>Folly:</hi> Not like a handſome <hi>Novice:</hi> who walks by with his Eies faſtned on his <hi>Back;</hi> prying <hi>careleſly</hi> who looks upon him? who beckens him in? if no body ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that expectation, then he begins to hate his own Face, to diſcommend what before he <hi>prais'd,</hi> as purpoſing to <hi>ſell,</hi> like the poor <hi>Stallion,</hi> his maſculine beauty. No Reader; I intend to pick out from the whole rable a <hi>Whore:</hi> and prefer her in a <hi>Character</hi> to thy immaginary view. If thou affect my deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thou wilt loath her: ſuch a ſtrange <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie</hi> bears it with its own ſenſe, having (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) choſen a Subject that infects wit. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe where ſhe ſtands in a <hi>Red-Waſtcot,</hi> that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106928:47"/>
is more out of faſhion then her Face, which was made fifty years before it. No doubt ſhe hath worn a <hi>Gown</hi> too: but that was when the ſale of her Beauty could return the coſt of it into the Bawds Purſe. Talk with her, and ſhe will bring thee into an <hi>ignorant</hi> Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, or a <hi>Jealous</hi> ſuſpence; who was thy Father? For ſhe ſlanders all Women, to make her ſelf appear leſſe common in <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon:</hi> and uſually in ſuch ambiguous phraſe, which <hi>effeminiſh</hi> policy affords: as thus. <hi>It may be ſhe is, it may be ſhe is not: but alas, alas, I know what I know, i faith, yet will accuſe no body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She is afraid to go to Church, leaſt the Sermon might convert her: and hates the Story of a <hi>decayed</hi> Whore, becauſe ſhe affects not melancholly. Her Breath is <hi>ſtrong</hi> enough to <hi>overcome</hi> thy ſenſe of ſmelling, and hath already ſcorch'd up her Noſe: which to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, ſhe wears before it a green Curtain.

               </p>
               <p>But now let our relation purſue <hi>Bunge:</hi> who within an Hour after he was beaten, return'd unto the <hi>VVard's</hi> Lodging: finding him at his arrivall tickled with a mad Laughter: whilſt he carried himſelf as alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unſenſible of any beating, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands what motiv'd that mirth. The <hi>VVard</hi> miſtaking the diſſimulation, changed his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour into a ſadder: asking whether he had delivered the Letter to his Miſtreſſe? no (quoth <hi>Bung</hi>) ſhe was gone forth to Supper, in the company of a certain Sweet-Heart: but I left it with the <hi>Bawde:</hi> who told me ſhe was to meet them at Eight of the Clock in Old Exchange, and then ſhe would deliver it. The <hi>VVard</hi> ſuppos'd all this was true: but griev'd that the Verſes were ſo inſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left in <hi>Peel</hi>'s Lodging: yet in expectation of ſome accidentall merriment, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to meet him likewiſe in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106928:48"/>
at the appointed Hour. <hi>Bung</hi> (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to accompliſh his deſires) tooke his leave, and went to a <hi>Taverne,</hi> whoſe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Dore enters into <hi>Turnball</hi>-Street: where he wrote a Note to <hi>Peele,</hi> and ſent it by a Drawer; accompanied with a Gallon of <hi>Sack.</hi> The Contents of which, deſired his Friendſhip, and that by the Vertue of the Wine, he might be licenſed preſently to ſpeak with him, where they would adviſe in compoſing of a Plot, how to be revenged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>VVard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peel</hi> having received the Letter, and the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> preſent, return'd him word, he was ſorrie for what was paſt, and greatly deſir'd that he would preſently come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to receive part of the Wine, and part of ſatisfaction. <hi>Bung</hi> was glad his Plot did thrive ſo well, went thither; and having made <hi>Peele</hi> promiſe that he would be in the <hi>Exchange</hi> about Eight of the Clock (to beat the <hi>VVard</hi>) he runnes to the <hi>Poultry</hi>-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: where he did Fee a brace of Serjeants to attend <hi>Peel</hi> in <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Side,</hi> that as he came back from the <hi>Exchange,</hi> they might areſt him upon an Action of <hi>Battery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Hour of meeting was now at hand, and <hi>Bung</hi> arrived there firſt. But preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after him, marched in the <hi>VVard,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106928:49"/>
onely with the Gentleman, (of whom we have ſpoken heretofore) who came thither purpoſely to ſee the new married couple. Our <hi>revengefull</hi>-Polititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an perceiv'd now a groſſe overſight, in the firſt contrivement of this geere. For whocan ſuppoſe the <hi>VVard</hi> would come thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone? or that having another Gentleman with him, he was not able to reſtore more Blowes, then <hi>Peel</hi> could give. Therefore their Backs being turn'd, <hi>Bung</hi> ſteales out of the next Gate, and runnes almoſt as farre as <hi>Paules</hi> in ſearch of a <hi>Porter.</hi> At laſt hee hired one to flie to the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and entreat the Gentleman (relating to him his name, and faſhion of Apparell) to come preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Queene's-Armes</hi> by <hi>Holborn</hi>-Bridge: for there (quoth he) you muſt ſay his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is arriv'd very ſick. The <hi>Porter</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his errand effectually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (without inquiring who ſent that meſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age) did take a haſty Farewell of the <hi>VVard. Bung</hi> returnes thither again, and finding him walking alone, went to him. By and by in comes <hi>Peel,</hi> and ſuddenly ſpyed that Face, which his Fiſt did intend to batter: not doubting but <hi>Bung</hi> (according as he had promiſed) would aſſiſt him in the aſſault.</p>
               <p>The firſt Blow that he beſtowed upon the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106928:49"/>
                  <hi>VVard,</hi> did ſo ſtagger him, that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he was unable to reſiſt. But <hi>Bung</hi> (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Key out of his Pocket) rewarded <hi>Peeles</hi> Pate with a prodigall recompence: and in the mean time the <hi>VVard</hi> recovered ſtrength enough, to be his own Avenger. <hi>Peele</hi> felt himſelf betray'd to the mercy of two <hi>mercileſſe</hi> Men: but ſtood yet ſtiffe to his tackling, being moſt pittifully maul'd with <hi>Bung</hi>'s Key: who did not forget (nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) to lend ſome Seaven or Eight blowes with it, unto the <hi>VVards</hi> face: the which he delivered ſo cunningly, that the <hi>VVard</hi> thought they came from <hi>Peel;</hi> and cry'd out <hi>murder!</hi> ſwearing how <hi>Peele</hi> fought with a <hi>Smith</hi>'s <hi>Hammer.</hi> He replies again (with a lowd voice) that it is nothing but a trick to excuſe his own treacherie: for I my ſelf (quoth he) have received Thirteen blowes, able to kill an Oxe. The people now came thronging on to part the Combatants. <hi>Peel</hi> being loath to be brought in publique ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, ſtole ſecretly away. The <hi>VVards</hi> Beaver Hat (bordered with Pearle, and adorn'd with a rich Hatband) lay upon the Ground: which <hi>Bunge</hi> (feeling with his Foot, and favour'd by the dark time of Night) convey'd into his Codpiſſe. The owner inquires diligently for it, and <hi>Bung</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:106928:50"/>
ſeemes more diligent in the recovery: having borrowed a Light of one that ſtood by him purpoſely to ſeek it, or rather to <hi>darken</hi> the appearance of his own <hi>hypocritical</hi> Theft, at laſt proclaims it to be loſt. Thus whilſt controverſies are here decided by a buſie multitude, the poor <hi>Drummer</hi> (walking homewards) was arreſted, and carried to the Countor. A while after the <hi>Ward,</hi> and <hi>Bung</hi> were licenſed to go home to their Lodgings: for the Conſtable (whom this hurly-burly drew thither) was contented (ſince the Offenſive party could not be found) to commit a <hi>wonder,</hi> by ſtanding to <hi>reaſon.</hi> And our <hi>Ward</hi> in complementall gratulation, went home bare-headed.</p>
               <p>The next Morning <hi>Bang</hi>'s appearance was ſummon'd to anſwer that arreſt which was ſerv'd on <hi>Peele.</hi> He prepares himſelf to prove it warrantable, but thirſting for a more full revenge, he entrears an old Friend (who was a meer ſtranger in <hi>London</hi>) to enter an Action of Debt againſt him (in ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known name) for Twelve Hundred pounds; which the Knave perform'd, and within an Hour after, departed from the City. <hi>Peel</hi> was clear'd of the firſt Action by asking <hi>Bung</hi> forgiveneſſe: who bought that honour with Four Shillings beſtow'd upon a Juſtices
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106928:50"/>
Clerk. The ſecond kept <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>him in the Counter Five daies: untill at laſt (having no Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to declare againſt him in the Court) he got his liberty: though he had payed ſoundly for being a Priſoner. What became of him and his Wife afterwards, I know not. But the <hi>Wards</hi> Face did almoſt <hi>enrich</hi> a Surgeon: for <hi>Bung</hi>'s Key had batter'd it into ſuch an ugly form, that it ſeem'd ever after a <hi>Bugg-bear</hi> to his own affection.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>Though my Man <hi>Bunge</hi> was poſſeſt with a ſudden Wit, and enrich'd with all thoſe qualities that compoſe a perfect <hi>Sharke:</hi> yet <hi>Cuſtome</hi> did operat ſo potently in him, that he could not chooſe but coſen himſelf: which doth impertinently marr thoſe parts, that were bad enough before.

One morning he preſented me with a counterfeit Hat-band: verily beleeving that I would pay him forty Shillings for it. I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked the price before I knew the qualitie of the Stuffe; carried it to a Goldſmiths, who
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106928:51"/>
being aſked whether it was worth ſo much, laugh'd, and told me it was Copper. Then I return'd home againe, and demanded him, wherefore he went about to cheat me? but he enquir'd, of what? I anſwered, of Forty Shillings. Forty Shillings (ſay'd he)? that's Money. Money! (replied I) what of that? <hi>Mary</hi> (quoth he) for money I'le cheate my owne Father if I can. A gracious Sonne! but ſurely his Father begot him by <hi>ſtealth,</hi> whilſt the Servants coming <hi>ſcar'd</hi> him in the Action, for he was both a <hi>Thiefe,</hi> and a <hi>Coward.</hi> When I firſt entertained him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (perceaving me a Stranger in the knowledge of our City faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) he told me, that to let him goe in Cloaks linde with Velvet, would be much for my credit. I thankt him heartily for his care, but in the performance appeared an Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que. Such like tricks as theſe made me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to part with him the next Quarter Day. And t'was a tardy remedy: for to tell thee the plaine truth, I had by this time (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt Ten Months ſince I came to <hi>London</hi>) conſumed Six ſcore Poundes of my Eſtate; ſo there remained but Sixty Pounds behind: which conſiſted in the reſidue of thoſe Jewels, that were yet unſolde. And all this proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the prodigall directions of that damnable Rogue. Perhaps thou wilt admire
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106928:52"/>
(conſidering my Purſe was ſo ſhallow) how I could take ſo much out of it, yet never feel the Bottom, never call to mind that I dip'd not my Hand into a Fountaine. T'is true indeed, it could not ever flow, but my Hopes guided me to a flood: ſuch a one as <hi>Jupiter</hi> made, when he ſhowred down Gold to <hi>Danae.</hi> It encompaſt a certaine Caſtle; which I had built in the Aire: whoſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was layd upon a little Book (then newly finiſhed) thinking it would have made me rich, both in Credit, and Money. But when conjectures came to the triall, the <hi>Stationer</hi> durſt not buy it, alledging that I was not publiquely knovvn to the World, and how t'is the Authors name which makes a Book ſell, not the vvorth of it. Then I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; if it were printed, I ſhould ſoone be famous, and I vvas alſo contented to honor him vvith my <hi>Maydenhead.</hi> But (quoth he) I am not contented to be ſo honored.

               </p>
               <p>This Book vvas intituled <hi>An invective againſt the Cittyzens, and Plebeians of London.</hi> It treated of <hi>Plebeians</hi> firſt by reaſon of the humble courſe of my proceedings: becauſe I ever obſerved to aſcend by degrees.

               <p>The <hi>Blebeians</hi> did then much trouble the State, with inſolent behaviour. For <hi>Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> (paſſing through the Streets) were rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interrupted, pointed, and laugh'd at in ignominious contempt, beſeig'd in their Houſes, and founde no <hi>Sanctuarie</hi> in their Offices: but were almoſt fain to beg a life of them, who (irrationably) under vale wed it in themſelves. Theſe outrages were moſt commonly committed by the baſeſt me chani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſont: who ſtilde themſelves <hi>Apprentices</hi> to attract more company. When they were once ſallied forth; they needed no encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement to Action, for a raſh ſelfe will did make them blind to all impediments.

               <p>Now ſome diſcontented Foreigners gave out, theſe Mutinies did continually revive, by the wilfull permiſſion of our City-<hi>Senators:</hi> whoſe actions reliſh much of <hi>Popular</hi> inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For Authoritie, or Wealth (being but <hi>fortunatly</hi> atchieved) cannot alter the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Blood.

Conſidering (likewiſe) they muſt neceſſarily have compell'd them, to be under the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Law, before effectuall ſentence could paſſe upon them.

                  <hi>modeſt</hi> forme to hide it from a publique obſervation: excuſing it to their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with a <hi>fearfull</hi> probabilitie of Warr. They never feele <hi>eaſe,</hi> but in <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>trouble.</hi> Thoſe that are rich ſtrive to <hi>Gentilize</hi> their Female Of-ſpring: but evermore pay for that ambition. As <hi>Wealth</hi> exalts them into Office, ſo they diſcharge it with their <hi>Purſes,</hi> not with their Braines. Authoritie (though in a low degree) heaves their Heartes into their Mouthes: for they will vent their Thoughts, as if their Lips were opened by a <hi>Priveledge:</hi> peruſing the actions of the King with a <hi>ſawcy-comment,</hi> and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a great deſire to mould his Affection in their owne diſpoſure: though (indeed) they weigh <hi>worth,</hi> like <hi>Gold,</hi> in a payer of Scales: where the <hi>lighteſt</hi> peece <hi>aſcends,</hi> but the heavieſt (which is the beſt) remaines below. The politique reaſon why they love Peace, is, becauſe they hate to <hi>buy</hi> a Warr. They deſpiſe Warr becauſe t'is good ſleeping in a whole Skinne. Beſides they are not valiant, even to the <hi>Fourth</hi> degree of Compariſon, (that is <hi>desperate</hi>); for they weare their Hearts in their Purſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, like <hi>Cowards,</hi> who going to fight, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie their <hi>Ranſoms</hi> in their Pockets. They
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106928:55"/>
alwayes profeſſe themſelves poore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe t'is a <hi>chargeable</hi>-glory to be <hi>rich</hi> in the Kings Bookes. Their Religion is weake in <hi>effect,</hi> and ſtrong in <hi>forme:</hi> depending much on <hi>Cuſtome,</hi> more on <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and moſt of all on <hi>Zeale.</hi> But t'is a <hi>politique</hi> Zeale: ſuch as preſerves Government more then Religion. Or rather an <hi>exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarie</hi> Zeale; that doth beget, and warme <hi>Faith</hi> in others, but heates not their owne Soules. Now though our opinion is more <hi>logically</hi> maintain'd; in that we do not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from <hi>particulars,</hi> but make a <hi>generall</hi> accuſation: yet know (Reader) there have binne many <hi>Cittizens,</hi> whoſe Virtue lends ſome luſture to their poſteritie. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I averr the Virtue of a good <hi>Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,</hi> differeth very much from the Virtue of a good <hi>Man.</hi> For the one uſeth all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues agreeable with a pure godly life: the other obſerves only the Lawes, which were made to preſerve civill commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie.</p>
               <p>But t'is time now that I returne unto my ſelfe. One Morning (lying in the Bed) I fell deeply to conſider, how I migh accrue profit by the diſburſment of my Ffty Poundes. At laſt (according to my old Cuſtome) I built another Caſtle in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106928:56"/>
the Aire: laying the Foundation on my <hi>Face,</hi> and proper <hi>Perſon.</hi> But the ſubſtance of it, was to furniſh my ſelf with rich Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell: and afterwards aſſault the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of ſome <hi>Wealthy</hi> Lady. For my Man <hi>Bung</hi> had often told me, that divers Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen (whom he knew) were bravely maintained by their <hi>Miſtreſſes.</hi> O ſuch fruitfull Land did I deſire to till! which makes <hi>Labour</hi> a delightfull <hi>ſport,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quites <hi>eaſe</hi> with Gold. As for Divinity, I would not think on it, leſt it ſhould make me melancholy. Beſides (like a damn'd <hi>Rogue</hi>) I held <hi>Whoredome</hi> to be the holieſt Sinne that is: becauſe <hi>Repentance</hi> ceaſeth on the Heart, preſently after it is committed.</p>
               <p>Now, art thou ſtrangely deſirous to know the manner of my proceedings? to underſtand in what kind I did ſhape this purpoſed adventure? I'le tell thee: but firſt prepare to admire my Capacity, for thy knowledge never owned ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Plot before. Which was, that I ſhould go to ſee a Play in <hi>Black-Fryars:</hi> and there (by all neceſſary conſequences, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſpired aſſurance) ſome rich Lady would caſt her Eie on me, and the ſame night me on her. Be not thou aſtoniſh'd
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106928:56"/>
Reader, neither ſuppoſe it impoſſible that Nature can be ſo opulent, or he that is mortall, poſſeſſe ſuch a ſtrong Brain. For (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs Man!) heretofore I was as full of theſe learned-Stratagems, as an Egge is full of meat.</p>
               <p>Fifty Pounds accoutred me from Top to Toe: having been very thrifty in laying out my Money, and carefull to refuſe <hi>Bunges</hi> advice, for he brought me a <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> whom Cuſtome had made to ſteale from himſelf. A Slave that the Devill durſt not truſt with his old Clothes; no, though he might gaine his Soul in lue of the Theft.</p>
               <p>Thus like a true <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> (who wears his Mother too much in his Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell) I enter'd the <hi>Theater,</hi> and ſat upon the Stage: making low Congies to divers Gentlemen; not that I knew them, but I was confident, they would requite me in the ſame kinde: which made the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſuppoſe us of very olde, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar acquaintance. Beſides (that I might appear no <hi>Novice</hi>) I obſerv'd all faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Cuſtomes; As delivering my Sute to a more apparant view, by hanging the Cloak upon one Shoulder: or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it fall (as it were) by chance. I ſtood
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106928:57"/>
up alſo at the end of every <hi>Act,</hi> to ſalute thoſe, whom I never ſaw before. Two <hi>Acts</hi> were finiſhed before I could diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any thing, either for my Comfort then, or worth my relation now. Unleſſe it were <hi>punycall</hi> abſurdity in a Country-Gentleman: who was ſo caught with the naturall action of a Youth (that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a raviſh'd Lady) as he ſwore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowd, he would not ſleep untill he had killed her raviſher: and how 'twas not fit ſuch Rogues ſhould live in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. This made me laugh, but not merry.</p>
               <p>Anon after, I ſpied a Gentlewomans Eie, fix'd full upon me. Hope and Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire threw me into ſuch Diſtractions, that I was about to bid a Boy (who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonated <hi>Cupid</hi> in the Play) to ſhoot at her with his counterfeit Arrow. But ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſclaimed me her Object: and with the like inconſtancy gaz'd upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. About the beginning of the Fourth <hi>Act,</hi> my Face withſtood a freſh encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, given me by a Ladies Eie, whoſe Seate oppoſed mine. She look'd ſtedfaſt on me, till the Play ended; ſeeming to ſurvey my Limbs with amorous curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: whilſt I advanced them all, to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:106928:57"/>
her approbation. A great deſire I had to ſee her Face: which ſhe diſcovered, by unmaſquing it to take her leave of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. But if ever I beheld one ſo ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour'd? do thou abhorre my Book. She look'd like <hi>December,</hi> in the midſt of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi> old and crabbed in her Youth. Her Noſe ſtood towards the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> point: and <hi>Snot</hi> had fretted a prepoſtrous <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell</hi> in the moſt remote corner of her Lip. Sure ſhe was chaſt, <hi>chaſt</hi> becauſe <hi>defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:</hi> and her <hi>deformitic</hi> (repugnant to the common courſe of <hi>Nature</hi>) might beget that <hi>Chaſtitie:</hi> but in whom? in others, not in her ſelf; unleſſe <hi>Neceſſitie</hi> did force it. For no doubt ſhe would be as leacherous as the Mountaine-<hi>Goate,</hi> had not Natures qualmiſhneſſe proved a ſtrong contradiction to her deſire: who heaved the Gorge, at her <hi>imperfect</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting: therefore had no Stomach to make a Man fitting her embracements. Yet ſhe wore <hi>Jewells,</hi> for the which I could willingly have kiſs'd her in the <hi>dark.</hi> And perhaps too (by <hi>guilded</hi> provocation) ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Office of a Husband.</p>
               <p>Her uglineſſe made me ſuppoſe that nothing could be too baſe for her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance: therefore I (following her
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106928:58"/>
down the Staires) reſolved to diſcover a good-will to her, either by a wanton geſture of my Body, or whiſpering in her Ear juſt as ſhe came forth into the Street, (her Uſher being ſtep'd aſide to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with parting Company) I proffer'd my ſervice to attend her home, if ſhe miſſed any of her Friends. She ſuſpecting that I thought her to be a Whore, told me aloud I was much miſtaken. Her Brother (unknown to me) ſtood behind us, and asked her; what the matter was? <hi>M'arry,</hi> (quoth ſhe) this Gentleman takes me for ſome common Creature. He with all violent dexterity ſtrucke me on the Face; and afterwards went about to draw his Sword. But I ſlunk through the preſſe of people, and very <hi>tamely</hi> conveied my ſelfe home. My Man <hi>Bunge</hi> (who atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there all the Play-time, to ſave char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) ſaw this: and heard the <hi>Young-Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant</hi> ſwear (after I was gone) if ever he met me, he would make my Heart the <hi>Scabbard</hi> of his Sword. Theſe woful tydings hee brought to my Chamber, ſo that my coſtly <hi>Experiment</hi> was now concluded, and my glorious Garments altogether uſeleſſe. For I durſt not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit <hi>Theaters</hi> any more, leſt I ſhould

meete with him, or Women elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, as fearfull of the like entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>Theſe <hi>Songs</hi> were ſeaſond with bitter accuſation, and not in ſuch <hi>hypocriticall</hi> phraſe, as doth diſguiſe Senſe from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Capacities, but ſtuft with <hi>immodeſt</hi> bluntneſſe.

               <p>When thou thinkſt upon thy poore fortunes, compare them with a meaner Mans: for ſo thou mayſt leſſen in thy ſelfe the greatneſſe of an other, and by that aggravate thine own.

               <p>All this while he was a greedy Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but perceaving me about to take my <hi>ultimum vale,</hi> ſteps up and replies thus.

in meate, wellcom'd my returne. Neither was my fearfull Experience (feeling even now the lightneſſe of your Trunke) igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant how, and where it had forſooke its weight. The tract and courſe of povertie I have often traced, and know ſhe is moſt undone in her reliefe. A pox upon your grave counſell! which is fram'd as though proceeding from a beggerly <hi>Patriarke.</hi> No advice is worthy of acceptance, but what accompanies a liberall Hand: t'is Money that makes a man able to keepe it. You direct me how to behave my ſelfe in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, when I have no Maſter: an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe weake and Childiſh; juſt like your actions, ſince you became a <hi>Londoner:</hi> which if preſented to the World in Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, would beget more laughter then eſteem. Come if you will ſeaze on my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, add unto your Money Fifty Pounds: furniſh me for a journey to the Court: where, by Wit, I will get relation to ſome Man of Ranke: grow a prompt <hi>intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer;</hi> and make you a <hi>Satyriſt.</hi> Such a one as Kings with <hi>flatterie</hi> ſhall be glad to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. A plague on all beggarly occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! I affect them not.</p>
               <p>Now Reader, judge thou whether this Rogue was not able to ſeduce a Novice. I could ſooner eate Iron then part with him:
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:106928:64"/>
but the next Morning, we ſat in conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how to get this Money. At laſt it was reſolv'd I ſhould counterfeit my ſelfe to be lately Knighted, and he ride with me to my <hi>Patrons</hi> Heir: adding on all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>Sir,</hi> unto my Chriſtian-name. But ſtay awhile, and let thy memory returne, unto the laſt part of our Fourth Chapter: where I threatned to make my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance coſtly unto a Clothier; that overtook me on the high-way. He often viſited my Lodging, and now I requited him by bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing his <hi>Gelding</hi> (worth Fourteene poundes) to take the ayre as far as <hi>Fullham</hi> but indeed detaind him a longer Iourney, and bought a Nagg for my Man <hi>Bunge.</hi> I riding like a <hi>Knight-errant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how my <hi>Patron's</hi> Heir entertain'd me, when I return'd, and all the reſt of my occurences, I am reſolv'd to publiſh with great care, and induſtry. Which if you ever meane to ſee, invoke the powers above, that what's already written may take him, whoſe acceptance makes my labor, eaſe: whoſe command (by I wot not what inſtinct) ties my Soule to a more <hi>delightfull</hi> ſervice, then either <hi>Gaine,</hi> or popular applauſe.</p>
