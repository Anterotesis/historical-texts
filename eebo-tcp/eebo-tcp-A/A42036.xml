            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He had one quality more in him, an unworthy and diſhoneſt one both, and that was, he accuſtomed himſelf, when covertly ayming to gain us to his Party, at the ſame time to put on the Fox his skin upon that of the Lions, or, (as I cannot better expreſs the ſame) to cloth, under the mask of <hi>Minos</hi> his juſtice, his own cruelty, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
            <p>To abridge my diſcourſe, the reſt of his abominable actions I'le leave further to be dilated, unto thoſe hereafter that ſhall be pleas'd more largely to pen the whole Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory thereof, not doubting, but many will ſtrive to make Poſterity acquainted with things of ſuch conſequence, and whether Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or Comedy, (call them as you liſt) deſerve not to be concealed. As for my part, I'le reduce unto thoſe paſſages before ſpoken of, one, or two of his moſt ſignal acts, to let them who admire his deeds, and count him praiſe-worthy for the ſame, know, a man cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

charges enough, is not able to find faults ſo many, or reproaches ſo great and ſhameful, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p>It's a maxime among Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, (I know not whether it be practiſed with other Monarchs, but among the <hi>Romans</hi> it's exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) <hi>viz.</hi> that, in honouring them, they ſet up for the reigning Emperours, publick Statues; for, as for Crowns, and Diademes, they ſuffice not (it ſhould ſeem) no, nor Scarlet, nor ſolemne Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, nor Taxes, and Tributes, nor great number of People to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud them at their firſt entrance into Supreme Authority: but it's their pleaſure, over and above, like Gods, to be adored, that thereby they may be held for more maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical and ſublime. They will alſo have the ſame adoration done, in like manner, even to their very Pictures, and Images, that thereby their eminency may be ſet forth more abſolutely, and completely. Among theſe Images, and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations,
<pb facs="tcp:51284:57"/>
each Emperour chuſeth ſeverally unto himſelf certain of them: <hi>e. g.</hi> Some, ſetting forth to the life great Cities making Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents: Others, a famous Victory crowned with triumph: Some, Magiſtrates on their knees, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes expreſſing their Charges and Offices: Others, cruell Beaſts kill'd with Arrows, directly ſhot through again; Others certain vanquiſhed <hi>Barbarians</hi> laid proſtrate at their feet, or otherwiſe kill'd in diverſe manners. For they deſire not onely the truth of things, whereof they aſſume the glory to themſeves, but alſo, to have Repreſentations, and Pictures thereof. See now how this man plotted, what craft by him was uſed againſt the Chriſtians. As thoſe, who in drinks ſometimes mingle poiſon, ſo he infuſed, upon a time, abomination among his Imperial Ceremonies, confounding together the adoration of Idols with the Ordinance of the <hi>Romans.</hi> For which purpoſe, among the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figies of Emperours, and other
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51284:58"/>
uſual Pictures, he cauſed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed the reſemblances of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and that done, expoſed them to the People, Cities, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Governours of Provinces. Theſe Images, or Pictures were after that manner contrived, that who ſo adored the Emperour, the miſchief could not be avoided, but, at the ſame time, he muſt, of neceſſity, adore therewith Devils, the Effigies, or Pictures of Devils, being ſo cunningly interweaved with thoſe of the Emperour. Now who ſo adored not thoſe Repreſentations, the Imperial Majeſty was offended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and the Party refuſing to give honour thereunto found guilty of High Treaſon againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. There were ſome wiſer, and more adviſed, who finding out the deceit, were not taken with this ſo artificially invented ſnare; who were afterwards puniſhed for ſuch their prudence, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, they had not honoured the Emperour: when as the true cauſe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51284:58"/>
was, for their being faithful rather to the great Monarch of heaven and earth, and to the true Religion. A great number of the ſimpler and poorer ſort of people were enſnared herein: who, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, deſerved to be pardoned for their innocency, being by ſubtlety thereunto inforced.</p>
            <p>After this ſort, matters being thus deceitfully handled, 'twill be ſufficient to make this perſon infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and worthy of juſt reproof, in regard private Perſons, and Princes, ſhould not govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alike in their affairs, their actions being of different weight and importance, a private perſon not ſo much to be blamed when he doth any thing by ſubtlety, and after a covert manner, becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, perhaps, he is not able to compaſs what he would have, by force, and therefore is conſtrained to uſe art, and diſſimulation: but, as for a Prince, it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, becauſe, as it is a ſhame to be overcome by force, ſo, I eſteem it

Certain chaſt Virgins knowing little of worldly affairs, as excluded from the ſight of almoſt all other ſave themſelves, by theſe barbarous <hi>Arethuſians</hi> having been dragged ſtark-naked into the Market-place, to the intent they might be put to the more open ſhame, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to have the hair of their head cut off, after which, their fleſh cut in peices, (my God! ſcarce have I the patience to repeat it) was immediately thereupon by them ſavagely devoured with their Teeth in a Feaſt ſutable to that their execrable fury, filling their bellies alſo then with the raw Livers of thoſe Virgins, and after that, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon meat being brought in, ſome of them took the bowells and guts of the aforeſaid Virgins, yet reak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot, and mingling them with hog-waſh, threw them to the Swine, before the others faces, that they might ſee their hungry hogs tear the ſame, and, together with barly mingled amongſt it, eat it up all. A diſh of meat which till then,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51284:65"/>
never the like was fed upon, and wherewith the Inventer thereof ſhould have endeavoured to glut the Devil onely: As, the truth is, the Devil after made a fine meal of the blood of the wounds which that wicked Emperour <hi>Julian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his bowells, and whereof he was ſlain when ſhot into his body in the laſt Wars that he ever fought upon earth, with the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</hi>

            <p>Again, who is ſuch a ſtranger in our affairs, as hath not heard of <hi>Marcus Arethuſius</hi> a famous man among us? who ignorant of the ſtory of him, except I relate the ſame at preſent? who in the raign of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s giving full liberty to the Chriſtians to exerciſe their Religion, pull'd down one of the Gentiles Temples, or rather a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, or habitation of theirs for Devils, and converted a great number of them that were Pagans unto the Chriſtian faith, to the right way thereby unto everlaſting life, as well by the excellency of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51284:65"/>
as by his eloquence: and for the ſame cauſe, was not well liked of by the <hi>Arethuſians,</hi> or, at leaſt, thoſe among them that were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Devils? But, ſince the affairs of Chriſtians were troubled, and that thoſe of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and other <hi>Gentiles</hi> began to riſe high, he could not avoid the violence of the time. For the vulgar, being wont; for a time, to retain their paſſions. as fire that is hid in wood, or, as a ſtream of Water that is ſtopt, upon any the leaſt occaſion riſeth, and breaketh through all. He then obſerving the madneſſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who were not a little animated againſt him, and threatned him, was reſolved at firſt to flye from them, not ſo much for want of courage, as to obey the command of Chriſt, which wills us to retire from one City to an other, and thereby to give way to our Perſecutours. For good Chriſtians muſt not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their own particular, though never ſo vertuous and conſtant, as beware of their enemies, and that,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51284:66"/>
on their part, they give not the leaſt occaſion to do them an injury, which, without ſcandall to their weak brethren, and to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of true Religion which pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely they make unfained profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of, 'tis in their choice to put by, or make prevention of. It ſo fell out, nevertheleſſe, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving many to be apprehended, and dragged before Magiſtrates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of him, and that there were ſome in danger of the loſſe of their ſouls, by reaſon of the cruel perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions wherewith they were affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in their bodies for his ſake, he would not altogether neglect them, who for the making ſure of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, were in hazzard to loſe their own. Wherefore, being firſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily and well-adviſed, he returns back from his retirement, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf to the people, reſolved with patience to undergo whatever calamities of the times: With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whereunto, what injuries and oppreſſions were there, unto which he was not expoſed?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:51284:66"/>
What could be more lamentable? every one brought (I know not what) reſolution to adhere to that foul ſin of diverſly afflicting him, carrying neither any regard to the conſtancy of him, nor to the quality of his Perſecutours; who were the more irritated againſt him through a ſuppoſition, that his return to them proceeded rather from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or neglect that he made of their perſons, then of any virtue, or conſtancy in himſelf to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe vvhatever tribulations to be inflicted upon him by their fury. Whereupon, this holy old man, this voluntary Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt vvas led through the City (venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for his age, but more for his life to all the vvorld) expoſed to theſe tyrants, and hang-men, and conducted by people of all manner of qualities, rich and poor, young and old, men and women, ſome of one ſort, and ſome of another, hurried together: yea (and which was more ſtrange to behold) thoſe who had eſtates, and were of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51284:67"/>
the wealthieſt, ſtrove together, were emulous among themſelves, who ſhould puniſh him moſt, all indifferently eſteeming it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable thing to inflict whatever torments upon him, and to triumph over him; Whom all the people of the Town villanouſly handled, ſome halling him through the Streets, other thruſting him into the Kennels: theſe plucking him by the hair of his head, thoſe ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him upon every part-of his body: uſing further, ſhameleſſe reproaches, and not to be ſpoken of, among ſo many other miſchiefs; juſt as thoſe are wont to be done unto, vvho vvere puniſhed in thoſe Paganiſh myſteries of <hi>Mythra.</hi> He vvas alſo lifted up in the air as in a ſvving, too and fro toſſed from one ſide to the other: he had his precious body received naked upon the points of their Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knives, who acted their parts in this mournfull and ſad Tragedy againſt him: Yea further, they put his legs in a preſſe, and ſqueeſed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51284:67"/>
them to the bones: they cut off his ears with a fine ſlender thread, making him, in the mean time, ſtand upright in a basket, and rubbing, or beſmeering him all over with honey and ſalt, they expoſed him to Waſpes and Bees about noon, when the ſun ſhined hotteſt and clear: which made his fleſh ſeem, as it were, to melt, and gave thoſe animals a warm throat full of this happy meat. I call the meat, this fleſh happy, becauſe, however tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, yet ſuffering patiently for Chriſts ſake, he rendred every part of his body happy, as a bleſſed ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and moſt acceptable in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>There's an other ſtory as well worthy to be remembred, and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of him, and that is this.</p>
            <p>This good old man and young both (for the dolours which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent in his old age cauſed him not to abate of the lively chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he was indued within his youth) ſmiling in the height of his torments, was heard to utter theſe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51284:68"/>
famous and moſt remarkable words unto his tormentours, ſaying, [I eſteem very much the poſture wherein you have put me in thus lifting me up, It's a good omen to ſee my ſelf exalted, and others below me.] He had as much to ſay touching the different condition wherein himſelf was, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe that perſecuted him: the contemplation whereof ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make him feel no more pain, then as if he had been onely an aſſiſter at the tormenting of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, taking thoſe his ſufferings for an honour, and not for a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherewith they ſeemed after a ſort, but indeed were no way able to afflict him.</p>
            <p>Where is there a man never ſo little gentle and debonaire, that is not affected with this gallantry, that reverenceth not this holy Martyr for theſe brave acts? But the times permitted not to ſhew pity in ſuch caſes to the Chriſtians, neither the irregular paſſions of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, whoſe unrelenting will it
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51284:68"/>
was ſtill, that the people, Cities, and Magiſtrates ſhould, by all means, carry themſelves cruelly unto us, though many of them, for all that, were utterly ignorant of the bottome of his wicked heart. Thus went the affairs with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant old man. If you ask the reaſon? 'Twas becauſe he refuſed to give five Shillings to his Executioners: which was an argument evident and plain, that he had the patience to ſuffer for the cauſe of God, and his true Religion only. In regard, whilſt they demaunded at firſt a great ſum of money, in lieu of the Temple it's being pull'd down by him, and would abate nothing of that price, but either the whole ſum was to be laid down by him, or elſe he rebuild it at his own charge, one would have thought this refuſall of him came from want of means, and diſability to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie what was demanded, rather then from zeal to the true Religion: but after that by his conſtancy he had gained to be abated in part, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51284:69"/>
continually had ſomething cut off with reſpect unto the price former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required, ſo that the demand in the end amounted but to a little in value, yea ſo little that it was eaſie for him to pay it, the difference between them was who ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main maſter, they in making him give ſomething, though never ſo little, or he, on the contrary, (who was not to be forced,) to pay any thing at all, although very many there were that voluntarily offered to give for him more then they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, not onely becauſe of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd piety, but alſo in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his invincible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable conſtancy. At what time a man might cleerly ſee, he fought not in this liſt for money, but for Religion.</p>
            <p>Let then thoſe that ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire this Philoſophicall Emperour, reſolve us, whether theſe, and the like actions of his, were ſignes of mildneſſe and gentleneſſe, or contrarily, of much pride and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty. As for my part, I beleive
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51284:69"/>
the Queſtion is ſoon anſwered.</p>
            <p>I have not as yet declared how this Sufferer was one of them, who had formerly ſaved this deteſtable Prince, when all his Race was in dangers, by ſecretly conveyhing him away from thoſe that ſought to deſtroy him. The reaſon, it may, be, of his deſerving to be ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly puniſhed, namely, for his imprudent preſerving him then, who became after ſo great a plague to all the world. In conſideration of which whole buſineſſe, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto the patient ſuffering all manner of cruell torments, and other lamentable reproches by this Martyr of ours, A certain <hi>Greek,</hi> that is to ſay, a Pagan in Religion, (though in his behaviour otherwiſe, ſomewhat above, and beyond all other of his kind that ever lived either before or ſince his time, to be admired at) being not able any longer to behold the tormentours on his own Party, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of him that endured thus all manner of puniſhment on the

[Are not we aſhamed, Sir, to fee our ſelves ſo overcome of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that we have not the power to be maſters over one poor old man, who hath gone through all ſorts of torments, and of whom, if we had had the better, it had been no great matter? is it not a great impeachment of our credit, when all's done, to retire vanquiſhed by him? Whereupon (as it ſeemed then) the other Officers bluſh'd, but thoſe Kings, that is to ſay, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Prieſts mock'd at it. Could any thing in the whole earth be more ſhameful and wretched, not with relation ſo much to him that ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame, as, on the other ſide, eſpecially, who cauſ'd theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, and other the like abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable outrages to be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice?</p>

In this ſort, after a moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, and never the like heard of inhumanity, dealt they with <hi>Arethuſius?</hi> So that the cruelty of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> and of <hi>Echetus</hi> will ſeem ſmall, in compariſon of theirs; more eſpcially of his who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them thereunto, and was Author thereof. O that I could meet with the Creature, that had the gift to infuſe into me the Knowledge of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of <hi>Thucidides,</hi> whereby to paint out the wickedneſſe of this man; to ſet forth in livly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours to Poſterity, the whole Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thoſe ſeverall paſſages of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found villanies that were acted by him throughout all his whole life.</p>
            <p>I paſs to make mention of <hi>Orontes,</hi> or of them who had their throats cut in the night, which he hid in favour of the Emperour, being ſtaid becauſe of the body of him to whoſe death he ſeemed to conſent, for that would be more proper to be put in Verſe.

            <p>Concerning all which, it's my advice not to tax him openly; and that becauſe himſelf was aſhamed thereof. And good reaſon, for it's certain, had he not endevoured to keep them ſecret, they had turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his confuſion, after made known and diſcovered.</p>

               <hi>that goes away from God ſhall periſh:</hi> In like manner, He that troubles them, who remain faithfull, and contrives puniſhments, whereof himſelf is worthy. With reſpect whereunto, If we muſt needs be ſuch, as he will have us, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our ſelves according to thoſe aforeſaid Precepts of our Saviour, concerning the regulating our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereunto: and, as for himſelf, in the mean while it may be lawful for him to live as wickedly as he liſts, in all manner of ungodlineſs, by uſing oppreſſion, and whatever other deceit againſt Chriſtians, that deſire to live more quietly, in all righteouſneſſe towards God, and good converſation towards their Neighbour: If the actions (I ſay further) of mans life, being either vertuous or vicious, the Gods,

whom thoſe of his own Party ſeem to worſhip and obey, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of vertuous men, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thoſe that are vicious: If this be a thing confeſſed by the Teſtimony of our very Enemies, and of thoſe that perſecute us, we have then gained what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have granted, we have obtained our cauſe. If it be ſaid by them moreover, that on their ſide alſo, they have any honeſty, or fair deportment, though but in word onely, and not in deed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and are not ſo impudent and accompliſhed in wickedneſs (thereby ſuppoſing to pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though not their prophane Gods) as to maintain, that vice appertaines to them as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inheritance: Let them ſhew us how, and what Juſtice there is in it, that we ſhould be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in our ſuffering afflictions, and they not to pardon ſuch as pardon them; conſidering we have the better at one time, and you at another; ſeeing the affairs
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51284:78"/>
of this world rowle and change, firſt of one faſhion, then of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Have the Chriſtians ever uſed you, as you have uſed them? What Libertys have we deprived you of? Againſt whom is it, we have incited the Peoples fury? To whom have we ſent Captains, that that did more than was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them? What People have we reduced into the danger of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding their lives for us? Who are they we have deprived of their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Honours, appertaining unto them, as to honeſt men? In a word, what did we ever commit like unto many things which you have in part executed, and in part, threatned to practiſe againſt us? Truely, you cannot ſay what: You (I ſay) who ſo reproach us for being defective, for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhort of that meekneſſe, and gentleneſſe, that by Chriſt our Maſters counſell is required of us.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Thou, who art ſo wiſe, and well adviſed, in ſhutting us up within the narrow Precincts
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51284:78"/>
of Chriſt's ſtricter adviſes in the Goſpel, why markeſt thou not, that in thoſe very places, ſome things are injoyned us, upon promiſe of reward, if we do thereafter, which are not impoſed for all that, upon neceſſity of obeying, under pain of puniſhment, if we not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the ſame?</p>
            <p>For, though it be a thing very excellent, and to be wiſhed that all were perfect, and if poſſible, attain to the top of well-doing, in whatſoever commanded, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden us: Yet, ſeeing there's a great difference between thoſe that do thoſe duties whereunto injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſome obtaining to a great height of perfection; others unto a mediocrity only: What reaſon haſt thou, to make Ordinances, whereunto all are not bound for obſervance, and yet puniſheſt ſuch as performe them not? Every one, not deſerving a reward for what he doth, being not liable preſently unto puniſhing for what he doth not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:51284:79"/>
And therefore, in binding our ſelves unto what we ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, as much as may be, through the whole courſe of our lives, it becometh us, at all times, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate our manners and actions, by the Laws of true Philoſophy; which, as it rewardeth ever, where rewards become due to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, by doing what it commands; ſo it puniſheth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But, I will again embarque my ſelf in the diſcourſe of what he <hi>[Julian]</hi> did touching Sciences, and the uſe of Tongues; it not being poſſible to ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

In which regard, he
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51284:79"/>
never did, (I may ſpeak it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially) a more unjuſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable action, than when he would have prohibited us Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans the ſtudy thereof. Which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe reſolution of his, barbarouſly intended againſt us, every man, me thinks, that with delight, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth himſelf to the profeſſion of good literature, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn, even as I do, who cannot hold from revealing my ſelf to be of that number, and who, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and in compariſon, thereof, have quitted altogether, and wholly abandoned all other things of this life; whether they be goods, money, jewels, plate, authority, honours, or the like traſh, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon thoſe unappeaſeable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentours; the vexatious deſires of this world, that as in a dream, bring fading pleaſures, but no true joyes to the beholders thereof with their eyes.</p>
            <p>But, as for my ſelf, I have embraced the onely ſtudy of Tongues, and other Sciences, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

no manner of regret at the pains I have endured, aſwell by Sea as Land, to attain thereunto; deſiring that I, together with all my Freinds and well-wiſhers, may be abundantly furniſhed, and fortified therewith: And which I have allwayes cheriſhed, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen above all things, next unto that Soverain good, the glory of God, and Salvation of the Elect, depending on him in his Son, and our Saviour Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that if every one <hi>(as Pindarus</hi> hath it) feels, or is ſenſible of his own loſſe moſt, it's neceſſary for me to diſcourſe of this ſubject; not any thing that can be imagined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo agreeable therewith, as to render all poſſible thanks to the Word or Son of God the Father, by the words and benefit of the tongue, for that the ſtudy of Tongues, and other Liberal Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences have hitherto been left free to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:51284:80"/>
But, what ayled thee? or from whence proceeded it (O thou light and unſatisfiable man!) that thou wenteſt about to forbid the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians this ſtudy of Sciences and Tongues? which was, not onely in the number of thoſe evils, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we were threatned, but alſo, well neer ordained and publiſhed. Why ſo? And Wherefore I pray? Whoſe counſell, reaſon (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you) hath carried thine Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding? (call'd by thee, in thine own terme, and fancied phraſe, <hi>Mercury.)</hi> What will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully wicked men, what inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Devils have ſuggeſted the ſame unto thee? If thou wilt, we will tell the truth, why.</p>
            <p>It was requiſite and meet for thee, after committing ſo many foul and enormous things, that thou ſhouldeſt be reduced unto ſuch a paſſe, as to be hurried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thine own confuſion, by, in what thou reputed'ſt more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and wiſe, therein unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly to make thy ſelf appear to

all the world a very fool through thy much over-ſight, and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
            <p>For, ſay, I pray; To what did this thy Ordinance tend?

If any equall, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different? produce the ſame, and wee'l quietly be ſatisfi'd without further complaining. For, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed we are to overcome with reaſon, ſo will we never (with Gods help) be ſo deſtitute of common ſenſe, ſo void of tolerable underſtandi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yea, but reply you, Sciences and the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue belong to us; even as Barbariſme, and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance to your Religion; which conſiſts in no other great matter, then to ſay only [I beleeve.] But they among you, nevertheleſs that follow the Sect of <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi>

For after this firſt, and ſo much eſteemed maxime of theirs, in making no further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, (which was injoyned all them that followed his Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,) he accuſtomed himſelf to ſpeak little: It being certainly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved among them, upon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Queſtion asked, or reaſon demanded to reply onely, [So <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> is of opinion.] and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with without other ſatisfaction, or further reſolution given, to reſt content. So that, it was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the ſame thing, though with ſome little change of words and ſyllables; for them to remain ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with <hi>Pythagoras</hi> their Maſter's [I have ſaid it.] as for us, with reſpect unto what ſaid by Chriſt our Maſter, to ſay [We muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.]
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51284:82"/>
All this notwithſtanding, you forbear not ſtill to mock, and detract us, for that, by our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we have bound our ſelves to give credit unto that, which Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons filled with the Spirit of God, have tranſmitted unto us. Whereas, their very authority, were there nothing elſe, is proof ſufficient for what they have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, being of more power, and force, to convince the gainſayers, than all the <hi>Ipſe dixit</hi>'s of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> all the Demonſtrations, and Poſitions of whatever other Philoſophers, and humane Doctors ſince the beginning.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe the tying our ſelves to believe certain Doctrines, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto us after that ſort, be lyable in good earneſt, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and juſtly contradicted by you: How can you prove the uſe of Tongues to be in your power only? If ſo, How comes it to paſs, that we, againſt your Laws, and Ordinances, have a ſhare therein? For, to whom belongs the <hi>Greek</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:51284:82"/>
Tongue? to whom to ſpeak, and underſtand it? I ſay, to ſpeak, and underſtand it, thereby to diſtinguiſh the force of words, with which you aequiocate, when diverſe things are comprehended under one, and the ſame expreſſion; ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding one thing, and ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? But thou muſt confeſſe, the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue depends either on the Service of thy Religion; or elſe, on the pleaſure of thoſe that firſt invented, and eſtabliſhed the ſame. If on thy Religion, tell me where, and by what Preiſts, it was firſt ordained, that the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue ſhould be ſpoken therein; as we ſee it hath been reſolved, whereof, and to what Divels, we ſhould ſacrifice? For, according to the Statutes, and Rules of your Doctors and Preiſts, it's not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto all, to uſe all alike; or, to one, to uſe all after the ſame manner. In what Place, (as in the Countrey of the <hi>Lydians)</hi> is it a holy thing, proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

unto <hi>Hercules?</hi> and to beleive, they do this fained God a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in ſinging reproachfully unto him? Or, (as to the Inhabitants of <hi>Taurus)</hi> to kill Strangers? And (as in <hi>Lacedemonia)</hi> to be whip'd till the blood ſprings forth untill it touch the Altar? To whom is it a holy matter, (as to the <hi>Phrygians)</hi> to be gelt, as they were, the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick ſweetly ſounding, and they loſing their genitals in dancing? Or, (as in other places) to uſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domy, keep brothel Houſes, and make uſe of ſuch other the like myſteries?</p>
            <p>There was a cuſtome, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance alſo, to ſpeak <hi>Greek</hi> unto ſome of their Devils. Which, if ſtill it ſhould be uſed, it could not prove, or thereby be inferred as a proper, and peculiar thing for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or Pagans to apply to ſome one of their Gods, or Devils that whereof every one might be ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, every one of them make uſe of:. Even, as it is ordained to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice very many things that are
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51284:83"/>
vulgar and common: which, if thou ſayeſt, it's not ſo, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alect of this tongue appertains pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to thee, as of thy domain, and in this right, repelleſt us: I anſwer, it cannot be comprehended what reaſon thou haſt for it, or how thou can'ſt appropriate it to Devils. For, although the Service, or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball</hi> of thy Religion be performed in the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, it followes not therefore, that the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue depends on Religion: neither is it a ſufficient reaſon to proſcribe, and exclude us from making uſe of ſo good a Dialect: the concluſion would not be pertinent. As if two Qualities happen to be in one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it followes not, thoſe two are one ſame thing. For, ſuppoſing one ſame man to have the Art of Drawing Pictures, and Melting Gold, it ſhould then follow that his Gold-mel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing, and Picture-drawing ſhould be one and the ſame thing: Which but to ſuppoſe only were a very vain, and moſt abſur'd conceit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:51284:84"/>
I demand then of thee, (who art ſo jealous of the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue,) what thou meaneſt, in not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but rather going about to hinder us from making uſe of it? Forbiddeſt thou us thereby the down-right, and trivial manner of ſpeaking thereof, accordingly as the Common People are accuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omed to ſpeak it? or, that of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more elegantly therein, and with choicer tearms, that are not ſo intelligible of the unlearned, or of thoſe that are not ſo well ver'ſt in the knowledge of Tongues.</p>
            <p>A Tongue is not proper, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to them, who have invented it, or to any Art, or Profeſſion comprehended in the mind: but to all that can underſtand it. For, even as in the Artificial tuning of Muſical Inſtruments, the ſtring heightned, or looſed, renders divers ſounds, yet all, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his mind, that, to make good Harmony therewith, playeth; and governeth the Inſtrument: So uſeth the divine Word, the great

Now, (Howbeit all the Actions of this our Impoſtor towards Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, in relation to what before ſpoken of, fall out to appear frauds, only cover'd over with courteſies, &amp; conſequently, far unworthy of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſty,) I ſhall yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome finer, and fuller of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety, that were acted by him.</p>
            <p>To which purpoſe, He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving after all this, that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fideration of the Precepts, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and Divine Teſtimonies, aſwell of the Old, as New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (of the Old, by Propheſies, and evident Inſpirations of Gods Spirit: Likewiſe of the New, by the Revelations of the Son of God, and of Miracles, great, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable to confirme us in thoſe things, which, by the Fundamental Poſitions of our Religion, we make open profeſſion of,) we began to become moſt conſtant, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Truth, and Faith of Chriſt; that we might not be quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in theſe reſpects without his aſſaulting, and offending us for the

ſame, as he did others, upon the like occaſion. Behold he contrives and puts in execution his deſignes againſt us! as <hi>Rabſheketh</hi> (Leiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant to <hi>Senacherib</hi> King of the <hi>Aſſyrians)</hi> ſometime did againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> who entered with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, into the Country of <hi>Judea,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 King. 18. 17.</note> and having with great power, laid Seige before <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to take it, when he ſaw he could not carry it by force, and that the Traitors within could not deliver him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing according to his expectation, he endevoured with fine words, and in the <hi>Jews</hi> own language, to make himſelf maſter thereof; which the beſieged taking notice of, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt that, addreſſing himſelf to them, he would ſpeak in the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> tongue, and not in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> for fear, leaſt under the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their own language, they might cunningly be brought into ſervitude: So this man [the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Julian]</hi> after the ſame manner, deſiring to bring us under his ſubjection, was upon the device
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51284:88"/>
of founding Colledges in all Towns, of erecting Pulpits to Preach in, and Chairs to read and expound his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> inſtructions, as well, thoſe that concerned manners, as other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended holy myſteries: likewiſe, of publiſhing a Form of Prayers ſung by them, and anſwered one toano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: alſo, touching the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of thoſe who ſhould happen to be faulty in the Preface of their <hi>Caball;</hi> and, generally, imitated all good orders, and eſtabliſhments that are obſerved in our Religion. For he had well-nigh brought to paſſe an Ordinance for building of Hoſpitals, and other Publique houſes, alſo Recluſes for Virgins, and other that for Devotion deſire to retire themſelves from worldly affairs: again, other Places, where care to be taken in making provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for ſick folke, and other ſort of Diſtributions to poor people: alſo, as we are wont to uſe letters of recommendation from one Countrey to an other in favour of the Neceſſitous, as occaſion offered

it ſelf, ſo would he have ordained to be done on his party: with the like wholeſome conſtitutions bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from us, and ſeemingly much approved, and liked by him, in like manner.</p>
            <p>Behold then, what this new So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſter, and Teacher of ſtrange doctrines had reſolved upon! But, in that, touching theſe matters, the purpoſe and intention of this man was not accompliſh'd and effected, I cannot ſay whether it was more advantagious to us, (that were forthwith delivered from him, and his) or to him, (whoſe enterpriſes were vain as dreams:) becauſe, eaſie it had been preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſcern the difference betwixt the actions of men, and the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Apes: Of whom, though it be ſaid, they can counterfeit ſome ſubtleties which men uſe, and do b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But, there's nothing prettyer, then (as on a Theater) to obſerve, and heed well the admirable imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of theſe men, and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy wherewith they endeavour to counterfeit us.

            <p>Again, touching <hi>Homer,</hi> and thoſe many fond ſtories fabled by him, where wilt thou affixe the ſame? For it's he, who of old, compoſed Comedyes, or rather Tragedyes concerning your fained Gods.

not commixing dry things with moiſt; there might eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger follow after, to the prejudice of the whole world. Be it ſo. But what tolerable reaſon may be given? what the leaſt ſober inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation can be made of that meeting of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno,</hi> the ſame time, when at mid-noon, not at mid-night, <hi>Juno</hi> ſo ſhameleſſely entreated, and entiſed him alſo, moſtlaſciviouſly to accompany with her? Your Poets endevour, indeed to diſſemble it in their verſes, ſtrewing for them a bed of freſh hearbs, and renewing the ſame with flowers of Safron, and Hiacynths. But where? and from whom had they theſe things? To what end further? and what reaſon is there yet among you, that the ſame <hi>Juno,</hi> Siſter, and Wiſe of the aforeſaid <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſhould ſometimes hang in the Air, and in the cloudes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ballanced with chaines of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51284:94"/>
Had any of the other Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a reaſon of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that his fair Goddeſſe was put into ſuch a poſture by him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firſt asking pardon of him, for that his preſumption, he had caſt himſelf in danger of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, for that his good Office ſhewed towards <hi>Juno.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At another time, the ſaid <hi>Juno,</hi> nevertheleſſe, ſportingly encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing her ſlender waſte in the looſe girdle of ſweet love, put on, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it, ſuch blandiſhments of enticing affections, ſuch wining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bewitching charmes of wanton expreſſions, that with his own lips thereupon, he could no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain, from giving ſentence on her behalf; proteſting ſhe ſo irreſiſtibly ſurprized him, in thoſe her amorous allurements, that, of all his other Miſtriſſes, there was none to be compar'd to her. What means alſo that divine myſtery of the brown eye-brows, and the ſhaking of thoſe locks that made all the heavens tremble? What the wounding of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:51284:94"/>
               <hi>Mars,</hi> that dull lover? and of that indiſcreet Adultreſſe <hi>Venus</hi> the fair, ſhut up in a brazen nett, bound, and manacled by lame <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> who, to his own ſhame and confuſion, aſſembling the Gods to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to ſee this ſpectacle, for a little money let them depart again? If able to render a reaſon of ſuch like toyiſhneſs, tell us further, I pray, what was meant by that fright, and ſtir among the Gods, touching that unchaſt <hi>Helena,</hi> that by reaſon thereof, the Heavens fell on ſuch a thundring, the Earth on ſuch a cracking, that it wanted little, but both had been removed out of their places: the Sea like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe turned upſide-down; the gates of Hell opened, and thereupon, what before, ſo long time lay hid, made known and diſcovered.</p>
            <p>All which, and more, a great many the like ſtrange things, having been as ſtrangely and diverſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto Poſterity; who is he among you, ſo ſubtle and profound, yea, though he had the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51284:95"/>
of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that with what ever diſcurring imaginations higher than the cloudes, can reduce them to common ſenſe, or in any kind of mediocrity, make them as much as tolerable to be underſtood?</p>
            <p>Which if true, &amp; they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to confeſs as much; in like manner acknowledge them to be baſe and diſhoneſt things; then the proof thereof, (without having recourſe to a Mythologie to ſerve them for a covering, with reſpect unto what they ſuppoſe ſo finely to have found out and invented,) will be apparent and manifeſt enough. What ſhall we ſay further? Is it not a handſome thing, think ye, for thoſe men, that hold ſo firmly &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly unto what in the Ceremonial circumſtances of their profound Religion, they make profeſſion of, to abuſe and fool themſelves after this ſort with obſtruſe and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe Fables? Thus, nevertheleſſe, they are accuſtomed to do, for the moſt part, who thereby would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in what ever, though never
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51284:95"/>
ſo weakly ſaid, or done by them, to eſcape from being reprehended. But they'le reply, perhaps, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes before ſpoken of are but meer conceptions, matters, which they ſo greatly ſtand not upon, but invented on ſet purpoſe onely to take up the Peoples thoughts, and delight their fancies withall. If ſo, then let them produce, and ſhew us other things of their <hi>Theology,</hi> that are more ſolid, and naturall, that we may further confer with them about the ſame, and, in the interim, tell us, whether it be not great ſottiſhneſſe to boaſt, and make a more then ordinary account of matters that are onely fabulous, and to be bluſhed at? Again, whether it be not a foul ſhame, to publiſh to all the world hidden things, and unknown to many (ſor every one is not learned) with pictures, and figures, and (which is worſe) with great loſſe of money in Temples, Altars, Statues? alſo by Sacrifices, which put men to the coſt of ſo many crowns? When a man may
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51284:96"/>
be pious enough in the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without much coſt, is it not a folly to deſire rather to follow er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and falſehood with infinite charges?</p>
            <p>But, let them ſay, they are Fictions and Jeaſts, wherewith Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets abound in their meaſures, and in Fables, to delight, and tickle their ears therewith that hear them, mixing, after that ſort, hidden and covered ſenſes, that few but learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſcerning men know how to make uſe of: I ask the queſtion, how can others make account of, or have thoſe deites in any great eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, when thoſe Poets of theirs, themſelves abuſe after that groſſe manner, the Gods they would have honoured, that it's reward enough for them, that they are not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their ſo doing? For ſeeing, by their Law, under pain of death, they are prohibited, in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to uſe whatever Blaſphemy, or reproach towards the Gods, what puniſhment, (ſuppoſe ye) are they worthy of, that frequently, and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51284:96"/>
in publique mock, and jeſt at them, in their Poeſies, after the fouleſt manner, with the filthyeſt, and moſt injurious taunts can be thought on; yea, and leave the ſame after, as in a Comedy, unto Poſterity, for, a long time, to be laughed at?</p>
            <p>Touching their having ſome things more covered, other more manifeſt in their Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of their Gods, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that in our Religion it is ſo alſo, but with this difference: In our Books concerning the ſame, the common and litteral ſenſe hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing foul, or diſhoneſt in it: and that which is hid to the vulgar, to the learned therein it's very admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and clear: even as if a body perfect in beauty were in ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret place, covered with a veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fit, and correſpondent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Repreſentations and Reſemblances of Divine things, ought, methinks, to have nothing therein diſhoneſt, or, unworthy
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51284:97"/>
of what they ſignifie: or, be ſuch as men would take ill, if the ſame ſhould be done unto them. Yea rather, they ought to be things exquiſite in beauty, or, at leaſt, not vile and baſe: that, either diſcreet men may juſtly take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception at, or, the vulgar be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſcandalized.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, what you pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, there's no credit to be given unto, and what outwardly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by you, is as deteſtable. For, what ſenſe is there, to make a man's ſelf be led in the ſtreets through the dirt, and drawn to the Port among rocks and ſhells? What is the end? And to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are ſuch like things recorded by you?</p>
            <p>As for thine own part, thou wilt forge us Jeſts, and Allegories, of thy Travels and imaginations, but no body will give credit unto, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> beleeve the ſame. And why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what already in ſight, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-board, is plain eno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gh, and intelligible. Whereby, as thou
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51284:97"/>
gaineſt none that will give eare unto thee, ſo thou loſeſt lookers on, to behold and ſee what thou wouldeſt have taken notice of: men, aſwell ſtopping their ears, as with-holding their eyes, the while, from the apprehenſion of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, and impertinent matters. Again, the reaſon of your Theory, and Allegories is ſuch, and ſo far from the purpoſe intended by you, that it is eaſier too bring together things far apart and ſeperated aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, than to make agree, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile in one and the ſame perſon, your fictions and figures.</p>
            <p>It being thus with them touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their religious Myſteries fought and derived from Naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, what may, or will be ſaid by them with reſpect unto their Morality? What Principles and Maxims have they in uſe therein to forme men unto vertue? What remonſtrances to better by degrees and make them more perfect? They'l reply, perhaps, and ſay, for example, firſt, that Concord is

a fine thing, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſee Cities uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, People, and Families agree well together, and Every one, for his own particular, to govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf according to the right Rules of uncorrupted Nature; which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating, and yet reuniting all things, hath compoſed, though of Many Parts, yet but One onely Frame, or fabrick of the Whole world. And this they'l not ſtick (it may be) to ſhew, and ſet forth by diverſe examples. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Wars of the Gods, their Seditions and revolts one with another, and an infinite number of miſchiefs, and evils which they ſuffered, and procured thereby, and whereof the moſt part of their Poeſies are full: Inſtead of peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, they make their Auditory mutinous; in ſtead of wiſe, vain; rather than thereby render the Proud, Humble; or the Audacious, Modeſt, and well mannered by ſuch examples. For if, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch (as it were) Pictures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, it be an hard peice
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51284:98"/>
of buſineſs, to bring them from evill to good, from vice, to vertue; who naturally are inclined, and given over, in a manner, to all filthineſſe. How may we imagine it a thing poſſible, to perſwade ſuch unto a more orderly life, unto more peaceably behaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: when in proſecution of ſuch their other evilly inclined affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they ſeem but only to conform themſeves, in ſo doing, unto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of their falſe Gods? which profain Deities of theirs, being diverſly ſet forth unto them by Poets, their only Preachers, (as I may ſo ſay) ſome as Patterns of one vice, ſome of another: What are they, the People, otherwiſe thereby, then as it were, encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the ſame? What their Gods, but their Guides (I mean the Peoples Conductors) in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever manner of evill Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

For their Gods to take vengeance on thoſe men, for acting thoſe things, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof, themſelves are eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially acknowledged to be Divine, and more particularly, adored as the only Patrons of ſuch affairs, and in whoſe behalf, it's rather an honourable, than reproachfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to be Vicious; (if vicious in ſuch a caſe, it be lawfull to cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, If we prefer, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll the honour and reſpect due to Fathers, and Mothers, and for that they are the firſt mediate cauſe of our entrance by Birth into the world, give them Honour with the firſt: Doth not <hi>Theology,</hi> and Reaſon both teach that we ſhould do ſo? To which purpoſe, doth not their God <hi>Saturne</hi> do well? hath he not left them a fine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample? He, who gelt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ranias,</hi> that he ſhould beget no more gods, and then threw his genitals into the Sea, whereof a God was after engendred? And <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that, in imitation thereof, rebelled againſt <hi>Saturne</hi> his own Father? Such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of cruell Paricides among the Gods, and the like, do they not well to inſert in their Books to be imitated of Children, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring their Fathers and Mothers, after the ſame faſhion.</p>
            <p>The third point, ſhall be Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Riches; as who can ſay, the not procuring of them at all hands, is no matter how, though
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51284:100"/>
never ſo wickedly. To which end, in what matter ſhall their <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> be repreſented? What ſhall we ſay to that ſharke? what honour? and after what ſcene, are we to atribute the ſame to his budget? to the vertue and gift of grace that this filching God had to ſteal, and carry away, with a trick of nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conveyance, whatſoever he once laid his prolling fingers upon? What to <hi>Phoebus</hi> alſo, who is ſaid to give nothing without gold? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom, nothing is ſo welcome as ready coin? Behold! are not theſe rare encouragements and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, to put men, though by nature otherwiſe never ſo cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly affected, into an utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of the muck of this world, money, ſo perniciouſly ſought after.</p>
            <p>Moreover, with what face can <hi>Jove</hi>'s Preiſts exhort his worſhipers unto Continency, when <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſometimes, wholly applyes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the love of Women? at other, to <hi>Phrygian</hi> boys? for whoſe
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51284:100"/>
ſake (if Poets ſay true) he turn'd himſelf into an Eagle. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo, wherefore is it, that at a Drinking match, wherein, meeting with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of your inferiour Gods, to the end thoſe profane Deities might be more voluptuouſly attended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you feign him to cauſe them to be ſerved, and waited upon by thoſe boys, he ſo much delighted withall, in ſtead of Butlers, and other Servitours? Let <hi>Hercules,</hi> (if you pleaſe) be there alſo, who deflowered fifty of the daughters of <hi>Thyeſtes</hi> in one night: And then I know no reaſon, wherefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put an end to this thirteenth labour of his, he may not be put likewiſe into the number of thoſe other Gods. Their furious, as well as fighting God <hi>Mars,</hi> will he not be a fine fomenter of Peace? A ready reſolver upon all occaſions, to cut of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>holler? <hi>Bacchus</hi> their God of Wine, a ſober Deity to encourage his worſhipers unto a due moderation in quaffing and drinking? And that crafty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51284:101"/>
of theirs <hi>Coſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er,</hi> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold men from deceipt and cozen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age?</p>
            <p>Again, when others are ſad, that move from place to place, upon ſeeble and weak legs; will not that limping God of theirs, that halts both on the one ſide, and on the other, be a notable bar, and obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to keep light and unſeaſonable Jeſters from ſcurrill mockery, and unbridled laughter? <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who together with a foul company of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther devouring Devils, ran ſo faſt to that pompous, and magnificent Feaſt of the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> without reproach; a jolly means to remove and take away Gluttony? In like manner <hi>Hercules [Kill-Cowe]</hi> (as he is ſometimes ſtyled) who, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting upon a time, a poor La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer, devoured one of the Oxen of his Team: And for that rare act of his, got himſelf a Name, or Title of renown? and generally all thoſe other Gods, that make ſo much haſt to be fed with the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, and incenſings, and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:51284:101"/>
out of all manner of Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings made unto them, in their Sacrifices.</p>
            <p>Theſe heatheniſh cuſtomes, hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full doings, horrible abominations uſually put in practice by thoſe of your Party, approach they any thing near (think ye) to that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, that excellency, that inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of ſound faith, and good life, whereunto we are exhorted, and which we [all that unfainedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, not only to be thought, but alſo to be indeed Chriſtians] are commanded in our Religion, and Doctrine? No ſuch matter. Beſides, we have other manner of light to lead us, other Teachers, (namely Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> to inſtruct us other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and to inſtill into our hearts obedience, and reverence unto what enjoyned we are, or, upon whatever terms, councelled and adviſed by them. From whom we, upon every occaſion (whatſoever too many of us, God knowes, either through weakneſſe, or, at leaſt,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51284:102"/>
willfulneſſe, have not the power, or goodneſſe to perform as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth their Diſciples) are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs at all times lovingly invited in the words of our Saviour, <hi>[—Whatſoever ye would that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 12.</note> 
               <hi>men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them: for this is the Law and the Prophets.]</hi> Again, it is, with us a ſin, not only to commit an evil actually either in word, or deed, but alſo to do the ſame in thought, as being liable thereby unto pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment before God (who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the ſecrets of the heart) thought not ſo eaſie to be taken notice of by men, who cannot ſee the ſame, and conſequently puniſh the offenders by that means.</p>
            <p>Yea, ſo exactly are we bound to carry our ſelves in point of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency (according to the Rules of Chriſt our Maſter) that even the eye is by him forbidden us, thereby onely to luſt after any unlawfull thing. In Point of Anger not only the bloody hand, but alſo the bloody heart is reſtrained. In caſe of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51284:102"/>
ſwearing, not onely that we ſwear not falſly, but alſo that not lightly in like manner, or, not at all: not at all, that is, in our common and ordinary diſcourſe and talke, or, when as not legally called before a Magiſtrate, thereby to atteſt the truth.</p>
            <p>As for our [goods (of fortune] as we uſually call the wealth of this world) to poſſeſſe them, as if we poſſeſſed them not, by not valuing them in compariſon of our chief good repoſed in heaven. With reſpect whereunto, ſome, among us, have taken little thought for poſſeſſing any; ſome, inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of have imbraced poverty: and, not a few, having firſt renounced the voluptuouſneſſe of the belly, and vice of gluttony (a dangerous Miſtriſſe, and Mother of many ſins) have after that ſo conſumed the part Mortall, by means of the immortal, (it may be ſaid of a truth) a man could not diſcern almoſt any fleſh on them, having acquired a law of vertuous living to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51284:103"/>
by not being carried away ſo much as unto ſmaller ſins, and whereof there is no account made that they are ſo.</p>
            <p>Is it not an excellent thing, thus, whereas others puniſh onely acts outwardly committed againſt God, or Man, we, the evil intentions of our hearts likewiſe? and thereby endeavour, at leaſt to cut away not onely the branches, but the root also, to ſtay not onely the ſtreams, but to ſtop up alſo the head of that impure fountain from caſting forth that noyſomneſs which would quite poiſon us after, through its more violent, and dangerous defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
            <p>Tell me, in what place among you, and what People they are, that wiſh well to theſe that injure them? Where is it (I beſeech you) that your men do good to thoſe that hurt them? as if reproaches offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing, but the truth? Who are they on your Party, that take it patiently when perſecuted? that upon with-holding from you your
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51284:103"/>
Cloak, will render unto them your Coat alſo? pray for thoſe that curſe you? and (in a word) by a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſweetneſſe, overcome evil with goodneſſe, endeavouring, by inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently ſuffering wrong, to make thoſe that afflict you therewith bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if it be poſſible?</p>
            <p>But admit we ſhould grant you, that by your manner of endoctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating your Diſciples, in time, you might cauſe them thereby to cut off ſomewhat from their former exceſſe, and ſuperfluity of naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: how could you, for all that, by your never ſo much inſtructing them in your Precepts, make them, or your ſelves attain unto that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, whereunto our Religion aſpireth? Seeing we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with well doing only for the preſent, but think ill of our ſelves, if not make a dayly progreſſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and further in godlineſs ſo long as we live in this world, and alſo cauſe the ſame to appear evidently unto all that are acquainted with us. If not endeavour, with all our
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51284:104"/>
power, to do thereafter, we ſhould be very ſorry, and fitly enough might be thought only to reſemble <hi>Moles,</hi> who are ſaid to move con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and yet not to ſtir far from the ſame place: or otherwiſe to appear unto thoſe that look upon us, like Horſes in a Mill, who, by the force of a whip, turn all day inceſſantly in the ſame room, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out advancing from where they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at the time, when they were firſt ſet about their work in the morning.</p>
            <p>For whatever mediocrity you ſuppoſe ſufficient for thoſe of your Party, by the Laws of your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Religion, to conſiſt in: we hold it our duty to ſtrive ſtill, and labour more and more to add ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to vertue, grace to grace, one good work ſtill to another: as never thinking our ſelves perfect enough, or to have done all that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us, while living in this world: till, at length, our race be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing run out here, we are brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of our journey, unto that
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:51284:104"/>
glory which is above, and after ſhall be revealed unto us, for which we were created at firſt, and whether, through Gods mercy, we doubt not but we ſhall attain at laſt, if, by the operation of the Holy Ghoſt, we fail not to ſet our mind, and thoughts for recovering the ſame, on the love of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, through a lively faith in his onely Son, and our alone Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: who, by the mighty working of his power, whereby he is able to ſubdue all things unto himſelf, will, without all perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, change theſe vile bodies of ours, and make them like unto his glorious body, take off from us the corruption of our fleſh, and put on upon us the incorruption of his Spirit, give us in exchange for this <hi>Bochin,</hi> or vail of tears here, the endleſſe comfort, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting joyes of that heavenly <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> which is above: or that ſecure Haven, after all our ſtorms in this life, of never failing happineſſe in the life to come: <hi>where we ſhall</hi>
