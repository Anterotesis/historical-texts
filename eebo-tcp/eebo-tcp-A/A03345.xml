            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Iuers causes (most reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Father) haue moued me to present this tretise vnto your grace. The one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause your grace hath been charged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend an error, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this doctrine that Christ in Soule descended into hell. The other, for that there is like to be as great strife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the true vnderstanding of this Article in England, as there was in Germany about the true meaning of (This is my body.) For the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preuention whereof, I thought it my parte though the vnwoorthiest of all the Ministers of the Church of England, to set down in this short discourse, a plain demonstration of the truth, and a refutation of the contrary out of Gods Booke and godly Interpreters. The last reason that hath
<pb facs="tcp:4298:3"/>
moued me to evulgate these my labors is this: I see diuers Ministers whome for their learning and life, I do honor, very often to preach against the true interprutation of this branche of our Creed, wherby the Papist reioyceth, the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist is hardned: and the common sort of people deuiding themselues as they affection. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers do vpon this occasion striue more bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one against another, then either of both do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our common aduersarye: and by this meanes turning our swords into our own bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, we are a pray to our enemies, and a scorne to the world. If therefore this controuercie be not shortly by the prouidence of almighty God, and your grace his ministery, decided: there will grow among vs enuy, strife, sedition, and al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of euill workes. Sith then as there is but one God, so there is but one truth. My humble sute vnto your grace is, that if the doctrine contained in this booke be Apostolicall: It may be autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized to proceede, and they that preach the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in this respect may haue their mouths stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: for if one builde and another destroy, how can our building prosper? if one gather and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther scatter, what profit will there be in our ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering? sith it is more easie to destroy and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then to build or gather: Agathon said, Euery Gouerner must learne these 3. lessons, the one that they rule men, the other that they must rule by the laws, the 3. that they shal not rule foreuer. In that vnder her most excellent Maiestie you
<pb facs="tcp:4298:3"/>
rule men, you must vse continuall care and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy. In that you must rule by lawes, you may not for feare of superior or multitude? for loue of freends, for hatred of enemy, nor for desire of reward, leaue the lawes of your Countrie vnexe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. In that you shall not rule for euer, you are put in minde that you shall appeare one day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the God of order, being the Iudge of the quick and of the dead, who wil seuerely punish you for the disorders which are in the Church of England vnpunished, except you endeuour as much as you can to reforme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Some preach what they please, some do what they fancy, some liue as they list: and the most are impatient of vniformyty, for some weare surpleases, and they are called, Time seruers: some gownes, and they are like Citizens: some clokes, and they are like trauailers: some Coates and they are like fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues. Nazianzene saith in his oration of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be vsed in diuine matters. <q>Confusion hath engendred thunders in the aire, tremblings in the earth, shipwrackes in the Sea, warres and strifes in Cities and houses, sicknes in bodies and sinnes in the soule.</q> So that by this learned mans iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the air, the sea, the earth, euery house, Cittie, body and soule, is ouerthrown by confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.

the vnitedst things as the bodye is, it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth: the holyest things as the soule is, it profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat Christ descended into hell, it is an article of our faith, and is to be beléeued as the rest of the articles are: for it is proued by many and manifest Scriptures, as it shal here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after appeare.

               <note place="margin">Psal. 16. 9. 10. 11.</note> verses, <hi>Wherfore my hart is glad &amp; my tung reioyceth, and my flesh also shall rest in hope; for why thou shalt not leaue my soule in hell, neither suffer thy holy one to see corruption: thou shalt shew me the path of life, in thy presence is the fulnes of ioye, and at thy right hand are pleasures for euermore.</hi> They that deny this place to proue the descending of Christ into hell, say that the woord <hi>Nephesh</hi> or soule, doth signifie the person of Christ, and <hi>Sheol</hi> the graue. But the place it selfe doth confute them, for as in the 11. verse he sheweth the resurrection of Christ and his ascension, so the 10. containeth his buriall and descending into hell, from whence he did arise. Some there be that deny that <hi>Nephesh</hi> the Hebrew word dothsignifie the soule sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the body, but they are reproued in the <hi>1. of King, 17</hi>

Psalme and other places. <hi>Fulgentius</hi> in his 8. Chapter to <hi>Thrasimund</hi> thus witnesseth farther, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for the full effecting of our redemption, that man as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpted to God should descend thither, whither man being seperate from God by the desert of sinne had fallen, that is to hell, where the soule of the sinner was wont to be punished, and to the graue where the flesh of the sinner was wonte to be corrupted: and that so notwithstanding, as neither his flesh could corrupt in the graue, neither his Soule could be tormented in the sorrowes of hell: for his soule being free from sinne was not to be subiected to punishment, and his flesh being without sinne, corruption ought not to destroye it. Mark the reason of this learned Father: for because man sinning had deserued to be deuided, because he was willing by the gilt of transgression to be deuided from God (which can not be denyed) therfore it came to passe that the death of the sinner did produce sinfull flesh to be corrupted in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graue, and did mancipate the soule to be tormented in hell: but that the sinner might be fréed by a frée gift, it came to passe that the sonne of God did suffer vniustlye of sinners the death of the body, which man being a sinner had suffered iustly of the iust God, and that his flesh should go downe so farre as slesh wrapt in sinne should come, and that the Soule of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour should descend into hell where the soule of the sinner was to be tormented.</q> Thus the holye Martirs in times past thought of this matter, and if they had liued in these daies to sée so great multitudes which professe the faith, to deny it after a sorte; no doubt they would haue writen more earnestly against them. But sith their woorkes be extant, I hope they that deny this manner of descending, wil answere their reasons, which in my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t were framed and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

by the holye Ghost. Wherefore sith <hi>Athanasius, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius, Ciril, Aepinus, Pomeranus, Vrbanus Rhegius, Lucas Lossius, Beecon, Hutchinson</hi> and many others, some Gréek, some Latin, some olde, some new writers, but especiallye <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> themselues the pillers of the Church, haue thus translated <hi>Sheol</hi> to be hell, my resolution in this point is with <hi>Aepinus,</hi> 
               <q>let him that will hold this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion (that <hi>Sheol</hi> signifieth the graue) I like not of it, it is grounded vpon weak, doubtfull, vncertain &amp; wrested proofes and coniectures: they that subscribe vnto it doo without iust and necessary proofes, rashly disagrée from the translation of our Psalter, from the plain woordes of the Apostles Créede, and from the consent of the olde Church, which alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeued that the bodye of Christ did thrée daies rest in the graue, and his soule did descend into hell.</q> And this consent in this point of doctrine to be in the olde and pure Church doth M. <hi>Caluin</hi> on the 16.

else a dead mans carkas must be accounted life or a person; both which are absurd in diuinity and philosophie. Secondly that the soule of man is in a graue and so buried, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the Soule to be mortall. Thirdly that the Gréek word <gap reason="foreign">

Lastlye it is an introduction to the error of the Saduces, which denye that there is any Angell, spirite, or any soule. For if there be any, then as <hi>Ciril</hi> noteth, it was necessarye that as he was<note place="margin">Ciril. de ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra fide ad Theodosin Imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem. ca. 12.</note> in body and soule with them that then were liuing; so was it as necessary that his soule should be present among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soules, to shew that he was a true man.

S. <hi>Peter</hi> applying this sentence to the resurrection of Christ, doth as it were point out with his finger to the places from whence these two partes seuered must be brought againe, namelye the soule from hel, for hel could not holde it, and the bodye from
<pb facs="tcp:4298:10"/>
the graue that it should not corrupt.</q> Here it is opened that death is a seperation of the body and the soule, and that the resurrection is a knitting of both partes together: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ was a true man, and had in him both a very body and a true soule. S. <hi>Peter</hi> sheweth that these two partes were not onely diuided, but also where they were du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of their seperation, and that miraculously nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the flesh did corrupt in the graue, as all other mens doo; nor the soule was left in hell, as the sinners soules were. For albeit he was accounted amongst sinners, yet he was none. Therefore wonderfully he came from the graue &amp; from hell: for as euery article of our faith is an vnsearchable misterie, so is this. It is miraculous that the world was made of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that Christ was conceiued by the holy Ghoste, that hée was borne of a virgin, that hée should suffer and dye for the sinnes of the whole world, and that at his death y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sunne should be abashed, the earth tremble, the flints cleue asimder, and the valle of the Temple rent: so in his resurrection the rolling away of the stone, the appearing of the Angell, the arising of many of the dead, and especiallye the rising of Christ himselfe so mightily, naturally, spéedily, and happily, was most wonderfull: so his ascending into Heauen in a cloud was in like manner to be meruailed at, and likewise his comming into indgement shal be most wonderful: in like sorte his buriall and going downe to hell are wonderfull<note place="margin">Ciril. de ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra fide ad Theod.</note> things as <hi>Cirill</hi> noteth before, whose woords are these <q>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should this thing haue had any miracle, vnlesse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne of God by the efficacy and nature of the diuinity had tarried in hell, fulfilling all things merueilously &amp; aboue the reach of reason, in his treatise of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right faith to <hi>Theodosius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

into hell; and the third day by the power of his diuinitye he raised his flesh out of the sepulchre, and the 40. daye after his resurrection he ascended into heauen the Apostles behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him.</q> For my parte therefore I admit the counsaile of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who willeth vs in matters of faith to beléeue the poore Fishermen <hi>Peter</hi> and his fellowes, rather then the subtile Sophisters, because then <hi>Peter</hi> affirmeth in the 2. chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> 
               <q>that neither his soule was left in hell, neither his flesh did sée corruption;</q> it is therefore manifest that these two partes flesh and soule are not one, as I saide before. These 3. things then would I craue of the aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this doctrine: the one where they finde in the woord of God the coniunction <hi>nec</hi> to be a coniunction that coupleth and interpreteth: secondly where they finde in the woord of God <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> for a graue: thirdlye that those thinges which are seperated by <hi>nec</hi> the coniunction, are one. <hi>Lylly</hi> in his Latin grammar handling the vse of coniunions, hath thus taught:<q> some are coniunctions copulatiue, as <hi>et, ac, que, atque, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, etiam, item, itidem, cum, &amp; tum, &amp; tum</hi> doubled: hither pertaine they which are contrary to these, <hi>

<pb facs="tcp:4298:11"/>
and by this meanes make of none effect those Scriptures, which proue there must be a two folde resurrection in vs, as there was in Christ, a resurrection of the soule and of the<note place="margin">Col. 3. 1.</note> body. In the 3. of the <hi>Colossians,</hi> ver. 1. S. <hi>Paul</hi> vseth these words: <hi>If ye be risen with Christ, seek those things which are aboue, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of the Father.</hi> Euen (as saith the Apostle) Christ his soule did arise aswel as his body, so must you haue the resurrection of your soule, aswell as the resurrection of your bodye. And thereupon diuers learned men interpreting this parcell of Scripture, haue noted that there is a two folde resurrection in vs, of soule &amp; of body, and that our bodies shall neuer arise to glory, vnles our soules doo first arise from sinne to grace.<note place="margin">Hugo Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalis in col. 3.</note> 
               <q>And therefore this is a generall distinction in learned wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, when they open this text of Scripture, that there is a double resurrection, of our soules, and bodies: the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our soules is by the humble comming of Christ: of our bodies by his glorious comming. </q>And this is made manifest also in diuers other such like places of Scripture. In the 6. chapter of the <hi>Romans</hi> ver. 5. S. <hi>Paul</hi> thus writeth, <hi>For</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 5.</note> 
               <hi>if we be grafted with him to the similitude of his death, euen so shall we be to the similitude of his resurrection.</hi> Where the Apostle thus exhorteth vs, that euen as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of Christ teacheth vs to seperate our selues both in body and soule from sinne; so the resurrection of Christ doth teach vs to arise from sinne both in soule and body. By these places of Scripture it is to be considered, that as Christ did arise both in soule and body, so must we: and therfore as Christs resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is not a full resurrection, vnlesse both partes did arise (for otherwise he did but arise in body as we doo) so these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations grounded vpon that doctrine are to no purpose, vnlesse Christs soule did arise from hell, aswell as his bodye from the graue: and last of all there is no more miracle in the buriall of Christ, then in any other godly mans: which as I proued before ought to be in all the personall actions that Christ wrought for our saluation.

hell is vnder the earth no man doubteth, for he that descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in soule into hell, ascended with body and soule into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen.

They that say that by this place is meant Christs preaching in the spirit in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of <hi>Noah,</hi> are many waies cléerely confuted. First because that <hi>mortificatus</hi> and <hi>viuifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catus</hi> two contrary particles of one tense are attributed to Christ, so that Christ being dead was aliue, and that at one time, and in respect of his humanity. Secondlye he sheweth how he was dead, and how he was aliue, by putting to <hi>
                  <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificatus carne,</hi>
               </hi> he was killed in the flesh, and <hi>
                  <hi>viuificatus spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu,</hi>
               </hi> he was quickned in the spirit or in the soule: for to say<note place="margin">Aug. epist. 99.</note> the Godhead was quickned is a grosse error. For as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> saith in his 99. Epistle, <q>it is very euident that the Lord killed as concerning the flesh went into hell.</q> Thirdly in his soule while he was yet dead in the bodye, hée went downe into hell, the Gréek woord is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which woord must néeds be vnderstood of the soule of Christ, because it is a motion from vs to another place, and not of the Godhead, and therfore is vsed again in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 22. verse, <gap reason="foreign">

Christ, in the 18. verse, the descending of Christ into hell in the 19. verse, his resurrection in the 21. verse, and his ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into heauen in the last verse. Fourthly, the Scripture doth straightlye ioyne together the passion of Christ with this perfection and preaching, so that Christ went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly after his passion to preach to the spirits. Neither dooth he deuide them, as though now he did suffer &amp; preach long before: for the resurrection and ascension héer spoken of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded this passion, so did this iourney and going into Hell. Fiftly the Scripture doth plainely attribute the preaching of <hi>Noah</hi> properly to the holy Ghoste, &amp; not to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> second person,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 3.</note> as it appeareth <hi>Gen. 6. 3. My spirit shall not alway striue with man.</hi> As all the scripture doth ascribe the doctrine and ministry of preaching to the 3. person, and that the 3. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son receiueth it of Christ, &amp; doth speak by the mouth of holy Doctors, inspireth the scripture, and reproueth the world or comforteth. Sixtly if the woord spirit must be vnderstoode of God héere, of whom Christ is quickned as some would haue it, it must néedes also be vnderstood of the first person that he preached in hell, for the scripture attributeth the resurrection of Christ to the Father. Last of all that we heap not to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye thinges in an euident matter, the participle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which were disobedient, doth fignifie and plainely shew this inobedience to be long before this preaching: so also the woord <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in times past and all the annotation of time fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, determining &amp; circumscribing the woord <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, which were disobedient, dooth altogither seperate the time of their incredulitye from the time of this iourneye and preaching. For if the meaning of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of this doctrine were true, <hi>Peter</hi> would haue ioyned this annotation of time which the iourney and preaching of Christ: and would haue said being quickned in spirit, in the which in times past, when the patience of God was looked for, in the daies of <hi>Noah</hi> when the arke was a preparing, he went and preached to the spirites now holden in prison. But <hi>Peter</hi> ioyneth the time of disobedience not with the iourney
<pb facs="tcp:4298:16"/>
or preaching of Christ, but with the first incredulitye and preaching of <hi>Noah:</hi> and on the other side knitteth together the prison with this iourney and preaching: which if he would haue disioyned he would haue said to the spirits which are now in prison, but he simply said, he went and preached to the spirits in prison, that is, which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were in prison, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he went and preached vnto them. This also may be added, that it is to no purpose to make mention of a prison, or to name them the vnbeléeuing spirits or soules of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde world; for <hi>Noah</hi> preached not to spirits or soules only. but to whole and beléeuing men, &amp; the woord <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> cannot be taken for men endewed with bodies, for Christ prouing his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vseth these woords, <hi>Luke 24. 39. Behold my hands and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 39.</note> 
               <hi>my feet, for it is I my self, handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me haue.</hi> It was no néed also to shew where these vnbeléeuers are, or be holden, for this both maketh nothing to the matter, and also would be vnderstood he holding his peace: vnlesse it was the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the Apostle to shew that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule of Christ went down to this prison, that is to hell: and so sheweth first that death parted them, as in the 2. of the <hi>Acts.</hi> Secondly that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> was in the graue, and the soule was in hell. Thirdly that it was not in hell idle, but did manifest his death to them which beléeued it to be but a fable, to reproue their increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and to captiue them that we should not feare them. Fourthlye he did rise againe triumphing ouer them in his owne person. Lastly he did ascend into heauen, and there sitteth Lord of heauen and of the Angels, of earth and of the inhabitantes, of hell, and of the very diuels. For the diuels are of him imprisoned and chayned, that they can doo no more then hee permitteth them. Farther where as some doo affirme, that there could be no preaching in hell, because there is no conuersion: to this I answere, that this preaching was not vocal but real, neither was there in this preaching edification, exhortation, or consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but as it is saide before of <hi>Damascene,</hi> a redargution
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4298:16"/>
or vpbrayding of those vnbeléeuing soules in this or the like manner: beholde ye vnfaithfull and broodes of the serpent, how in season and out of season my eight preacher of frée righteousues and other the Patriarkes haue often preached vnto you, that there should come a blessed séed of the woman according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promise made vnto <hi>Adam,</hi> that both should iustifie the beléeuers, deliuer and saue them from the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and spirituall deluge, and also that he should destroye the serpent with the vnbeléeuing séed for euer: but to you being incredulous that promise was a fable. But now beholde (O ye wretches) me to be exhibited of the true God, and by my passion, the head of Satan and his vnbeléeuing séede is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the worlde is ouercome; and on the other side you shall be forced to know by liuely experience, that the faithful are saued. And to conclude, you now doo beholde me the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queronr of Satan and his members against your will, and to your great sorrow in soule, and shall sée me héereafter in the last iudgement both in body and soule. And this manner of spéech is vsed in the Scripture, that a verball preaching is<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 4.</note> put for the reall opperation of a thing: so <hi>Heb. 11. 4.

as <hi>Peter</hi> saith, &amp; <hi>Athanasius</hi> in his book of the incarnation<note place="margin">Athanas. de incarnat. verbi.</note> of the world hath thus written. <q>In the death of Christ, his body being carried into the graue, his soule went into hell, the places being far a sunder: and a little after he saieth, for death could not preuaile on his humaine soule to tye him there, neither corruption by tiranny inuading his bodye could shew his force on him to putrefaction, as thinges not wel séene vnto. For to think so of him were a wicked thing; and euen as <hi>Adam</hi> had a double punishment inflicted on him for his disobedience, the one was on his body, earth thou art and to earth thou shalt returne again: and so by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crée the body of the Lord departed to the earth: the other on his soule, thou shalt dye the death: héerof it commeth to passe that man is diuided into two partes, and is condemned to departe to two places: and therefore it was necessarye that by the selfe same iudge which had made this decrée, that he by himselfe being vnder the colour of a condemned man, shewing himselfe vncondemned and sincere from sinnes, should frée from that sentence all beléeuers. </q>The like hee hath in his tracte against <hi>Appollinarius</hi> of the wholesome comming of Christ, and in his Sermon against all heresies. You sée good Reader, how <hi>Athanasius</hi> a very auntient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Gréek Church, shewing the cause of Christs des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending into hell, proueth out of <hi>Gen.</hi> that as our body was punished by death for sinne, so was our soule: and for this cause both partes in Christ must descend, that our soule may be deliuered from hell, and our body rise to glory: For<note place="margin">Fulgent ad Thrasim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> li. 3. ca. 7.</note> as <hi>Fulgentius</hi> writeth in his 3. book and 7. chapter to King <hi>Thrasimunde,</hi> 
               <q>he did know that God the suscepter of whole man, was wholy with his flesh in the graue, wholy with his soule in hell, wholy in the world, wholy in heauen, wholy in the vnity of the nature in the Father of whom he came; and wholy by the omnipotency of his diuinity in all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creatures which he made. The Apostle kéeping this vnitye of person doth thus confirme the Church of Corinth in the faith of the truth. For first of all I haue deliuered you that which I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4298:17"/>
haue receiued, that Christ died for our sinnes according to the Scriptures, and that he was buried and rose againe the third day according to the Scriptures. He saith not that the body of Christ was dead, but Christ that he might kéep the vnity of the person of God and man; and that he might shew the substantial propriety of the deity and humanity. In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he sayth, for although he was crucified of infirmie, yet he liueth by the power of God.</q> Héer we are taught that the whole humanity was assumpted into the Godhead, and that death albeit it did sunder the body and the soule, yet it it did not sunder the Godhead from either parte; and for this cause the Godhead being with the flesh in the graue, it conld not corrupt; and the same Godhead vnited to the soule, the soule could not he left in hell: but euen as his body was in graue to shew him to be true man, and it rose againe without corruption to shew him very God: so his soule was iu hel to shew himself a true man, &amp; it came from hel to shew<note place="margin">Ciril. de ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra fidead Theodosiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> himself a true God, and a most glorious conquerour of al his enemies both in earth and in hell. The like hath <hi>Ciril</hi> in his treatise of the right faith to <hi>Theodosius,</hi>
               <q> the soule of Christ being coupled to his Godhead descended into hel, &amp; vsing the power of God did appeare to the soules that were there. And writing on <hi>Iohn</hi> in his 12. book and 36. chapter; and when the time was come that he should preach to the soules that were in hell (for he came to be Lord of the liuing and of the dead) he dyed for vs: and this proper passion of our nature he willingly took on him as concerning this flesh, albeit as God he is life naturally, that hell being spoyled he might be the first fruites of them that fléepe, and being made the first<note place="margin">Occume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</note> begotten of the dead, as the Scripture calleth him, he might giue to our nature a returne to life. And of this iudgement is <hi>Oecumenius</hi> interpreting the Scripture, Christ dyed for the vniust, not only for them which were after him, but also for them that were before him, and therefore went down into hell. As the death of Christ was auaileable vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that dyed before him, so the descension of Christ into hell was profitable to them that liued before Christ, as well as to those

               <q>that Christ prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in hell to them which in the dayes of <hi>Noah</hi> were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beléeuers, that is, condemned in the nethermost hell: then he alleageth the place of <hi>Ephe. 4.</hi> before by me alleadged, and therupon thus concludeth, I expound therefore this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle simply:</q> and againe, I meruaile what men meane, that they deny that Christ descended into hell. <hi>Alesius</hi> did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that any man would deny this article, because it hath so many confirmations, and in euery confirmation, in such order as they are set in the Créed, are proued the death, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending into hell, resurrection, and ascension of Christ toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For in the 16 Psalme he beginneth with the death of Christ in the 10. verse, but in the last verse he speaketh of his resurrection and of his exaltation at the right hand of<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which proue the descending<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into hell.

Secondly of his buriall in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> same verse; of his descending into hell in the 13. verse, of his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in the 32. verse, and of his ascending and exaltation to glory and his giuing of the holy Ghost in the 33. verse, so in the 4. chapter of the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> there is not onlye mention made of Christ descending into the lowest partes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4298:18"/>
but also it is saide in the 10. verse, that he ascended far aboue all heauens. And also in the 3. chap. of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> not<note place="margin">Phillip. 2.</note> only the Apostle declareth the humility of Christs death, but also setteth downe his presence in hell, and that euerye knée did bow vnto him, and euery tung did confesse him to be the Lord: and thus he sheweth, first who was highly exalted? he that hath made himselfe of no reputation: from whence he was exalted, from those that were vnder earth: where he was exalted, that is, farre aboue al heauens: and lastly, who exalted him? that is, God his Father. So in this place <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> proueth in the 18. verse the death of Christ, in the 19. verse the descending of Christ into hell, in the 20. verse the end of his descending, that is, to reproue them of ther disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the preaching of <hi>Noah:</hi> in the 21. ver. he speaketh of the resurrection of Christ, in the 22. verse he endeth the ascending vp into heauen vnto the right hand of God, that all Angels powers and might, might be subiect vnto him. In all these Scriptures the order of our Créed being kept, and all these thinges plainlye proued, very great cause of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is giuen to <hi>Alesius</hi> and many learned men, why this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle should be denyed which is confirmed by the scriptures, that the death, buriall, resurrection, and ascension of Christ are confirmed: and therefore those that deny these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to proue the descending of Christ into hell, may aswell deny the resurrection of Christ, for the resurrction being the ioyning of both partes of the manhood of Christ together, cannot cléerely be proued vnlesse it be shewed from whence both partes seuered came, which is proued before to be thus, the soule of Christ from hell, and the body from the graue.<note place="margin">Ob.</note> Further where it is héere argued by some, why should <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> héere dispute of the spirits or soules detayned in hell, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering he exhorteth to suffer afflictions: I answere that he<note place="margin">Sol.</note> might shew to the faithfull which then were persecuted ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often to death, that the soules doo not perish with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as the soule of Christ did not perish, when he descended into hell: but as the soule of Christ did triumph ouer the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
<pb facs="tcp:4298:19"/>
so shal the godly triumph ouer them that persecute them. But some will say, how did Christ triumph ouer the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell<note place="margin">Ob.</note> by descending into hell, sith it was the extreamest degrée of his humilitie. To this I reply, that euerye article of our<note place="margin">1. Tim. 19. Sol.</note> faith is a misterye, <hi>1. Tim. 1. 9. Hauing the misterye of the faith in a pure conscience;</hi> And therfore in all the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Christs humility he shewed himselfe alwaies to be a glorious God, he was borne of a poore Uirgin in a small towne, in an Inne, yea and in a Stable, he was wrapte in cloutes and layde in a cratch; yet the Shepheards of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> féeld, the noble men of the East, the starre in the firmament, and the Angels from heauen did witnes in a merueilous sorte, that he was the sonne of God. The birdes as our Sauiour saith, haue nestes, the foxes holes, but the Sonne of man hath not where to lay his head: he was called a glutton, a drunkard, a Samaritane, a fréend of Publicanes &amp; sinners, a man possessed with a diuell: his Disciples also were very poore: but yet he gaue sight to the blinde, hearing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deafe, spéech to the dumme, cleansed the Leapars, raysed the dead, commaunded the windes, the sea, yea and the very diuels, In like manner, when he was humbled to the death of the crosse, albeit he was in the state of dereliction and cryed my God my God why hast thou forsaken me: yet at that time the Sunne was abashed, the earth trembled, the vaile of the Temple was rent, the stones claue asunder, the dead arose yea, and vpon the crosse he forgiueth the théefe on the right hand: and euen as in his natiuity, in his life and death, he shewed himselfe to be both God and man, so in his descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into hell he proueth the same, and in this lowest degrée of his humility as he proueth himselfe a true man, for that his soule was among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soules in hell, so by triumphing ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sheweth himself to be a true God. And for this cause it standeth well with the mistery of our faith, that his going down to hell is both the lowest degrée of his humilitye, to shew him to be a true man, and also the beginning of his endlesse triumph, to proue him a glorious God, in all places
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4298:19"/>
and at all times, &amp; ouer all persons for euer. Some curius<note place="margin">Ob.</note> body will say, what néeded he to manifest his death to those<note place="margin">Sol.</note> in hel? it was néedful in respect of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were in hel, in respect of vs that liue now, and in respect of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue preached in times past, and in respect of Christ himself. In respect of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were in hell, because that those which would not hear the vocal preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> should sée Christ really present in soule, and so confesse that the destruction of their bodies in the deluge, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> damnation of their soules in hell was iust. In respect of vs which liue now, because that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we finde by Gods woord that he manifested his death in earth and hell, we should not remaine incredulous but beléeue in Christ, least hearing of the wondrous workes of the Sonne of God, which he hath wrought for vs. and for our saluation both in earth and hell, and despising the same, we féele by experience with the damned olde worlde, that Christ was in hell for our deliuerance from hell: and denying with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate Iewes this comfortable article of our faith, we be cast into those insufferable torments of extreme damnation, from which to deliuer vs Christ in a maruelous manner descended into hell. It was néednfull in respect of them which preached in times past, for sith <hi>Dauid</hi> and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets haue foretolde of this going downe of our Sauiour, and that his soule should not be left in hell, it was I say most requisite that the Scripture should be fulfilled. It was néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full also in respect of Christ himselfe, for he came to subdue our enemies, therefore as <hi>Dauid</hi> trampled on the face of <hi>Goliah,</hi> so was it méet that Christ in soule should triumph ouer the diuell, that he might haue all power not onlye in<note place="margin">Ose. 15: 14. 1. Cor. 15. 55.</note> heauen ouer Angels, or in earth ouer all the inhabitantes therof, but also in hell ouer the diuels. And for this cause as he hath saide, <hi>O death where is thy sting, O hell where is thy victorye?</hi> so shall all his members say: and shall for this their wonderfull and glorious deliuerance from death, bell and the diuell, sing, reioyce, and giue thankes for euer.

               <hi>Vrsinus</hi> and others, that Christ descended not into hell; I will answere them by Gods grace, and proue that it was not the meaning of the holy Ghoste to haue them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged to that purpose. The first Scripture is that which is written in <hi>Ioh. 19.</hi> ver. 30. It is finished, therfore Christ néeded not to goe down into hell: this is a false kinde of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, <hi>á dicto secundum quid, ad simpliciter:</hi> for if all had béen finished then christ néeded not to haue dyed, nor to haue shed his bloud: for he was aliue when he spake these woords. Therefore these woords, It is finished, are to be referred to all the prophecyes that precéeded the death of Christ: that is, that all the prophecies of the Iewes and Gentiles which should conspire together against him, either of <hi>Iudas</hi> that should betray him, or of the Souldiours that should appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, or of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> false witnesses which should belye him. or of the place where he should dye, or of the time when, or of the manner how, and of the Iudge vnder whome he should suffer, or of the transgressors with whom he should be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: al scriptures concerning al these things were fulfilled.

Al these interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations I haue read and doo allow off: by which it is many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that whatsoeuer was to be doone at the death of Christ was finished.

after, there remained also y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> resurrection, ascension of Christ, and sending of the holy Ghoste, but these things pertayne to his victory, not to his sight, and they are rewardes for his fight, not labours. </q>Moreouer as yée read in the birth of Christ, <hi>Mat. 1. 22.

They that so conclude are deceiued in two things, the one is, in that they imagine this woord <hi>me,</hi> to signifie the soule of Christ, which signifieth the Godhead: the other in that they take this woord <hi>to daye,</hi> to signifie the space of 12. or 24. houres, which indéed signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth for euer: both these shal be strengthened by Gods grace with proofes. First the circumstances of the place doo proue these thinges most euidentlye. For what dooth the théefe aske? deliuerance from the gilte of sinne, from the cursse of the lawe, from the wrath of God, from the terrors of death from the tormentes of hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the tirannye of of the diuell. He asketh not only forgiuenes of his sinnes, but that he may be a new creature, that the righteousnes of God may be giuen him, that he may haue the adoption and liberty of Gods children, and so after his death glory, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, peace and immortality, that is, familiarity with God; he asketh to be an heire with God, and a ioynt heire with Christ for euer. In one woord he asketh a kingdome pure<note place="margin">Mar. 2. 7.</note> in righteousnes, perfect in peace, perpetual in ioy. <hi>Who can forgiue sinnes but God only? Mar. 2. 7.</hi> Who can giue this kingdome but God? and therfore these woords <hi>with me</hi> signifie the Godhead and not the soule of Christ, as some <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> haue it.

<pb facs="tcp:4298:23"/>
at any time, he made the punishment of homicide, martyr dome, the truth being accounted among the wicked: he left th'one on the left hand, and tooke the other on the right hand, as he will doo in the day of iudgement. Where I note that Christ did on the crosse, as he will doo in the day of iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: that is, seperate the bad from the good, and cast the wicked into hell: which is the office of the Godhead, <hi>Psalm. 7. 11.</hi> God iudgeth the righteous, and him that contemneth God<note place="margin">Psal. 7. 11.</note> euery day.

               <hi>laide vp for me the crowne of righteousnes which the lord the righteous iudge shal giue me at that day, &amp; not to me only. but to all them also that loue his appearing. Augustine</hi> hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like saying also vpon this place, the crosse<note place="margin">Aug. in Luc 22. 24.</note> if you marke it was the iudgement seate, the Iudge was set on the middle, the one théefe which beléeued was deliuered, the other which blasphemed was condemned. To saue and condemne is the office of God, and therefore must néeds be vnderstoode of the Godhead. So saith <hi>Ambrose</hi> in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<note place="margin">Ambro.</note> of the holy théefe, he sawe him hanging on the crosse, and praieth to him as though he were sitting in heauen, he séeth him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned and yet he praieth to him as to a king. So <hi>Ferus</hi> on the 27. of <hi>Mat.</hi> Thou shalt be with me which<note place="margin">Ferus in Mat. 27.</note> am euery where, which am all in all. To be with me ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not spoken of the soule of Christ but of the Godhead. <hi>Damascene</hi> saith, to speake more expressely he was in the<note place="margin">Damasc:</note> Sepulcre according to his body, and in hell according to his soule; but as God he was both in Paradise with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> théefe, and in the throne with the Father aud the holy Ghost. And as <hi>with me</hi> signifieth the Godhead, so <hi>to day</hi> fignifieth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. For (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> noteth in his Metaphisicks) <hi>in aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis non est tempus.</hi> In eternall thinges there is no time: for time is the measure of those things which are subiect to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: now in hell all shall suffer, in earth all must labour, so in heauen all must rest. <hi>Apoc. 12. 13.

By the petition of the théefe, for he asked the kingdome of heauen: 2. By that which was forgiuen him, his sinnes: 3. By that which was giuen him, that was glory: 4. By the place where it was giuen him,
<pb facs="tcp:4298:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that was paradise. 5. By the time for how long it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him that is for euer: Lastlye by the person that giueth it, that is Christ, who being euerlasting as I proued before, forgiueth infinite sinnes, giueth grace alwaies in his euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting kingdome and in all eternity for euer. And of this iudgement is S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> who answering the like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection<note place="margin">Aug.</note> of the aduersaryes of this doctrine in his time, this hath left in writing: <q>there is an other meaning also much more frée from all ambiguities, if it be taken to be spoken not in respect that he is man, but in respect that he is God, to day thou shalt be with me in paradise: for the man Christ was in respect of his flesh in the graue that day, in respect of his soule in hell:</q> and the same Christ was God euery where and at all times. The last place that is alleadged by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers of this doctrine, is the last spéech which Christ vsed<note place="margin">Luk. 23. 46.</note> vpon the crosse. <hi>Luc. 23. 46. Into thy hands O Father I commend my spirite.</hi> Out of which place they thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the soule of Christ was committed to his Father in heauen, therfore it went not to hell: which is a false con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence. For they imagine héer that the hands of God sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth heauen, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be proued out of this place. For this scripture being a deriuatiue place out of the 31 Psalme and 5. verse, teacheth vs this: that as the soule of <hi>Dauid</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the figure of Christ, did not immediatly after this prayer goe to heauen, but was guided by the hand and gouernment of the Lord in all maner of perils: so it dooth not follow that the soule of Christ being committed into the hands of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (for these woords are spoken in respect of the manhoode of Christ) should passe immediatly into heauen: but should so be guided by the Godhead, that it should passe through death and hell mightily without resistance, naturally with out as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, spéedily without tarying, and happily without any returning: But for the better vnderstanding of this place, you must note how many waies this woord, (the hand of the Lord) is taken in the holy book of God: that when we sée the diuers acceptation of the woord, we may take that sence

For this being a deriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue place, is taken out of the <hi>31. Psal.</hi> and 5. ver. Therfore as the soule of <hi>Dauid</hi> did not immediatly after goe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, so did not the soule of Christ. For if he went vp immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly, then Christ did ascend before he did descend, which is contrary to the Scriptures in many places. In the <hi>Ephe. 4.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 9.</note> 
               <hi>9. Now in that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lowest partes of the earth?</hi> But if the soule of Christ went into heauen before he was bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:4298:25"/>
or descended into hell, as the gainsayers of the doctrine stoutly affirme, then he ascended before he descended, which is contrary to this Scripture: therefore good Reader marke these circumstances, 1. Who must descend: that is Christ. 2. Whether? into the lowest partes of the earth, which I haue proued before to be hell: for as ascend and descend are contrary, so is heauen and hell. 3. When must he descend? first before he ascend. <hi rend="margQuotes">And thus as many learned men before<note place="margin">Eras. in 4. ad Ephe.</note> named haue vnderstoode this place, so dooth <hi>Erasmus</hi> writing on the fourth Chapter of the <hi>Ephe.</hi> certainlye this is the thing that the Palsmists by the inspiration of the holy ghost spake of so long agoe; for Christ hauing already conquered the hell, is ascended aliue againe into the high kingdome of his Father. And a little after he addeth, after most low hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling followeth most high aduauncing; from the most high heauens, then the which nothing is higher, he deiected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe euen into the hell, the which nothing is lower. </hi>When <hi>Mare Magdalene</hi> came to Christ, <hi>Ioh. 20. 17.</hi> Christ saith<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 17.</note> to her, <hi>Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father, but to goe to my brethren, and say vnto them, Iascend vnto my Father and to your Father, and to my God and your God.</hi> Héer the truth it selfe saith, he had not yet ascended into heauen: whosoeuer therefore affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the contrary, affirmeth an vntruth. They wil answere Christ was not ascended in respect of his body: but I reply, if Christs soule being the principall parte of the humanitye had béene in heauen, as they imagine, then this speach is vntrue: marke my reason, for in death when both partes are sundered, a man is saide to be where his soule is, and not where his body is: for the man taketh his name of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall parte. In this forte Christ saith, <hi>Mat. 8. 11. Many shall come from the East and West, and shall sit with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Isaac, and Iacob, in the kingdome of heauen.</hi> Héere you sée because the soules of those Patriarkes are in heauen, they themselues are saide to be in heauen. Euen so if Christs soule were in heauen, Christ was in heauen, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4298:25"/>
then this saying can not be verefied, I haue not yet ascended to my Father, for Christ ascended visibly, and for this cause willeth <hi>Mary</hi> to goe tell his brethren, whome he calleth to this action as witnesses. For as the time of his ascending is noted to be forty dayes after his resurrection, and the place to be <hi>Bethaniel</hi> and that on a mountaine, that it might the more esily be séen, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maner of his going to be meruelous for he was carried vp in a clowde: so his faithfull Disciples and glorious Angels were witnesses of his triumphant ascension into heauen. Out of these Scriptures this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, as Christ was borne but once. dyed but once, was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried but once: so he did but once descend into hell, once arise from the dead, and once ascended into heauen, and but once shall come into iudgement. But if the soule of Christ went presently into heauen, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not only this absurditie followeth that he ascended before he descended, but also that there are two ascendings of Christ into heauen: the one inuisible of his soule, the other visible of his body. <hi>Ignatius</hi> who died in the yéere of our Lord 112. (For he was cast to beastes to be deuoured) this Father lyuing in the time of <hi>Policarpus,</hi> who was Scholler to <hi>Iohn Euangelist,</hi> in his Epistle to the<note place="margin">Ignat. epist. ad eccles. Trallis. Athanas. in Symbolo.</note> Church of <hi>Trallis</hi> thus writeth; <q>Christ descended into hell alone, but he ascended with a multitude. <hi>Athanasius</hi> in his Créed saith, who suffered for our saluation and descended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell: and interpreting the <hi>2. Cor. 6.</hi> he saith Satan was enuyous against our Sauiour, for he killed him not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it would be against himselfe: for Christ after his crosse, going downe into hell hath vanquished death, and because he knew no sinne he could not be holden of death: so saith <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ambro. in Gal. 3.</note> in his exposition on the 3: Chap. of the <hi>Galathians,</hi> for when they thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he should be slaine that he might not teach, they profited nothing, for his doctryne encreased, and he euacuated death in his passion, for descending into hell he deliuered mankinde: for that cause he suffered himselfe to be murdered, knowing that he was for vs against the Diuell. And the same Father writing on the <hi>1. Tim. 2.</hi> chap. thus
<pb facs="tcp:4298:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
confirmeth this doctrine: because man now reconciled to God was subiect to infernall death, that he could not ascend to God to whom he was reconciled, our Sauiour to bring his will to effect, suffered himselfe to dye against lawe, that descending into hell, he might condemne death for the impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it wrought on him: taking away from death those which he hid holde, that from hencefoorth whatsoeuer had the signe thereof, shovld not be detayned therewith; of which thing he shewed a testimony, when he arose.</q> Therefore to ende these woords, into (thy hands I commend my spirite) doo not shew vs the state of Christs soule, but sheweth vs how we must pray in all our tribulations, and in the houre of death. For the soule of Christ no doubt was in hell: but this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that spirite héere signifieth the soule, which in S. <hi>Peter</hi> they will in no wise confesse. Farther where it is obiected<note place="margin">Ob.</note> that <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, it is left out of the Créed of the Romane and orientall Church; I answere, that is not <hi>Cyprians</hi>

Last of all because it hath béen confidently auouched, that all the reformed Churches beyond the Seas allowe not this doctrine, I will therefore héere reproue that allegation as most false and vntrue, First as before I haue proued that <hi>Aepnius, Luther,</hi> and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Centuries confirme this doctrine, so héer I will<note place="margin">Pomera. in Psal. 16.</note> adde to them <hi>Pomeranus,</hi> who trauailed much in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Churches of Germany, who thus in his exposition of the 16.

And as this

was the iudgement of that reuerend Father, so was it no doubt the iudgment of the Synode of learned men assembled together in the conuocation house at that time, which was Anno Domini, 1571. who by an iuiunction there made tooke this order, that no other Catechisme in this Realme should be taught. Which iniunction if it had béene kept, we should not haue so many sectes in our Church as we now haue, to the great dishonour of God, the ioye of our endlesse aduersaries the Papists, and the bitter gréefe of all the good Ministers of this Land. The articles also of the Synode of London in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yéer of our Lord God 1552<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> published by the Kings authority approue<note place="margin">Artyc.

               </q> which I haue before alleadged. But because now the iudgement of boyes is more estéemed then of reuerend Fathers, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry singuler schismatique is more estéemed, then a whole Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node of chosen and expert men in diuinitye. Héereof it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, that whatsoeuer hath béene most gladlye and learnedly proued by M. <hi>Nowell,</hi> and approued by our cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations, is accounted error: and whatsoeuer euery fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall spirite dooth vtter without study rashlye, and without feare of God presumptuously, is accounted truth, as though it had béene méerely reueiled vnto them from heauen. For what a rashnes and presumption is this, to say all reformed Churches are of their opinion, whereas the contrarye dooth appeare by their own writings to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great glory of God, and to the no lesse great shame of them, which in the Pulpits af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme most impudently, that all reformed Churches beyond the seas are of their iudgement.

For <hi>Sybilla</hi> thus prophecied of Christ as <hi>Augustine</hi> witnesseth in his 18. booke of the Cytie of God, the 23. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <q>he shall come into the handes of Infidels, and they shall strike him with their filthy handes, and with their vncleane mouth shall cast on him their poysoned spittles, he shall giue simply his holy back to strips, and receiuing buffets shal hold his peace: for his meate they gaue him gall, for his thirste vinegar, shewing this table of inhospitality: for thou being a foolish nation didst not vnderstand thy God delighting in mens soules, but didst crowne him with thornes, and didst giue him bitter gall. But the vaile of the Temple shall be rent, and at noone it shall be darke for 3. houres: and he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for thrée dayes shall sléepe, and then returning from hell shall come into the cléere light, being the firste that shewed the beginning of the resurrection.</q> The same verses of <hi>Sibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> are repeated by the same <hi>Augustine</hi> in a sermon which he<note place="margin">August. li. contra Iud.

               <hi>Phil. 2. 10.</hi> If then we be led by the woord of God as we should be, then I hope I haue sufficientlye proued this article by the blessed woord of God, if Fathers, al, both gréek and Latin teach this doctrine to be true. If we estéeme the iudgements of the Ministers of the reformed Churches, if the aduersaries of this doctrine haue one to stand in their side, we haue fiue on ours: if we reuerence the authority of the Synode or conuocation of England, they allow this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certion. If we honour reuerend antiquity, this doctrine is most auntient: for it hath béen deliuered not onlye of late by <hi>Nowell, Beecon, Fox, Hutchinson, Lamier, Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir, Hipperius, Pomeranus, Lucas Lossius, Aepnius</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:4298:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Luther:</hi> But in times past by <hi>Augustine, Ambrose, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, Cyprian, Fulgentius, Vigilius, Oecumenius, Atha nasius, Epiphanius, Cyrill, Ignatius:</hi> Yea it is deliuered by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> themselues, and this antiquity ioyned with verity is very strong as <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith. All these before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with infinite others, which for breuities sake I omit, were the deuout faithfull learned and zealous defenders of Gods faith, and for this cause were hated, reuiled, persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or murdered. And besides all these not only <hi>Zacharye, Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> foretolde of this descending into hell, but as you haue heard before, <hi>Sybilla</hi> being a Prophitesse of the Heathen. And as S, <hi>Augustine</hi> truely noteth, not only the creatures in heauen, in earth, and in the graues, but also the very diuels haue confessed it; which those that are possessed with diuels, as the Iewes, <hi>Seruetus,</hi> and <hi>Carleil</hi> doo denye stubbornlye without relenting, and desperately without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, and obstinately without ceasing, notwithstanding all those honourable witnesses of Prophets, Apostles, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and Fathers before by me alleadged. <hi>Ioshua</hi> saide to<note place="margin">Ios. 24. 15.</note> the Israelites, <hi>Ios. 24. 15. And if it seeme euill to serue the Lord, chuse you this day whom you will serue, but I and my housholde wil serue the Lord.</hi> So let others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue as they list, I and all those that beléeue my doctrine, will beléeue this article litterally as it lyeth, and as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue the rest. For if hell héere should be taken metaphorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as some wil haue it, so may you allegorise the whole créed as doo the Heretiques, and so ouerthrow the whole substance of our faith. Besides no hell being in our Créed, men will not beléeue there is any hell at all, as doo the greatest parte of the worlde, as their blasphemous mouthes and abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble liues declare the same euery where. Wherfore I exhort<note place="margin">Aug. ad Euodium Epist. 99.</note> all men with S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in this sorte, epist. 99. <hi>ad Euo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> therefore let vs holde most firmelye which our faith hath, being confirmed with most grounded authoritye, that Christ dyed and was buried and rose againe the 3. daye, and all other things which are written of him: amongst which

also this one is, that he was in hell. And againe, who but an infidel will deny Christ to haue béen in hell? but because I know the Papists dooth reioyce to sée this schisme in the Church of England, therefore let them well vnderstond that<note place="margin">Hierome ad August.

for the rebuke of the Children of God, so should they refuse the damned security of the papish Synagogue, to enter into this tossed and militant Church, where great troubles cause great praier, and great praier causeth a great calme, and a great admiration of Christs power is caused by the great calme, and great admiration causeth great thanksgiuing for euer. But what is the cause of these schismes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church? <hi>Leo in Epiphania ser. 6.</hi> sheweth the same; <q>the Diuell is gréeued with the calling of the Gentiles, and is vexed with the daylye ruine and destruction of his power: sorrowing therefore that he is forsaken and the true king is woorship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of all men, he layeth snares, and raiseth discentions.</q> As héere, so in the 13. of <hi>Mathew</hi> you may learne who is the author of schismes, Satan: where dooth he sowe this wicked séede? in the féelde and Church of the Lord: how dooth he sowe it? he turneth himselfe into an Angell of light, and so doo his ministers, alleadging the woord of God contrarye to the meaning of the holy Ghoste: why dooth he raise discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? because he séeth himself forsaken and Christ worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: when dooth he sowe schismes? while the seruants slept. The sléeping therefore of the Ministers is an occasion that schismes are not onely sowen, but are rooted and doo growe<note place="margin">Chrys. in Gal. 3.</note> and fructifie.

And whereas according to one God, and one Lord, and one baptisme, there is also one faith: we fal away from that which is the only faith, and whiles moe faithes be made they begin to come to that, that there is none at all.</q> For we know that sith the Synode of the <hi>Nicene</hi> assembly there is nothing else written but the faith, but while there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention about the wordes, and question of nouelties, and while there is occasion of doubts, while there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainte of the authors, while there is strife about studies, while there is a difficulty in one consent, while one begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to cry <hi>anathema</hi> to another, almost no body belongeth to Christ Iesu.

Let vs not all vse the function of the tung, which is most readye and prompt in all: for we be not all Apostles, we be not al prophets, we be not al interpreters. For albeit it is an honourable thing to talke of God, yet is it more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to kéep our selues pure vnto God. It is a great and worthye thing to be a teacher, I heare thée: but it is with out danger to be a learner. Why doost thou being a Shéep take vpon thée the office of a Pastour? Why doost thou being a foot, take vpon thée to be a head? why doost thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Souldiour take vpon thée to be a leader of an armye? why doost thou séek for those great, but doubtful and daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous gaines of the sea, while thou maist kéepe thy self in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the land, albeit with lesse gaine? If thou be a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto Christ, and hast thy sences exercised, and doest shine in the bright light of knowledge, goe to speak the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of God, I say that wisedome which is preached among the perfect, and which is hidden in mistery, and that in such sorte at length, as if thou shalt get a fit opportunitye, and hast it committed to thy faith. For what hast thou of thy selfe, that thou hast not receiued it? but if thou be tender of age, or of a base or abiect minde, or of weaker strength then that thou art able to wade in higher matters, follow the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> be content with milke. Why doost thou desire strong meate, which thy members for weaknes can not consume and turne into nourishment? tell me if thou haue any thing better then silence? therefore where it is better to holde thy peace then to speake, be silent. And a little after he saith, if thou doost resemble <hi>Moses</hi> in vertues, enter also into the Cloude it selfe, and speake to God and heare his voice, and promulgate the Lawe: if thou also be <hi>Aaron,</hi> ascend toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truely, but stand without the Cloude, somewhat nigh. But if thou be <hi>Ithamar</hi> or <hi>Eleazar,</hi> or some third from <hi>Moses,</hi> of the order of the Senatours, and of their number, stand farther off and be content with the third place. But if thou be a lay man or of the basest sorte, let the hill it selfe
<pb facs="tcp:4298:33"/>
kéep thée back, which also if any beast touch, he shall be sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: tarry beneath and heare the voice onlye, and that after thou hast purified thy selfe, and that I may more plentifully instruct thée, who did consecrate the Préest? <hi>Moses.</hi> Who was the first that was consecrated? <hi>Aaron,</hi> who did care for the things that pertained vnto God, who was in stéed of the voice? Moreouer in the holy places, who might enter but one, and that not euer but once a yéer. <hi>Heb. 9.</hi> Who might carry the arke but the Leuytes? <hi>1. Leuit. 15.</hi> And they as they were appointed, for some were of a high office, some of a lower as euery one was worthye, and because that ought to be kept, it was appointed also, who should kéepe it euerie way:</q> for some should kéep one side, some an other side, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should any thing remaine indistincted or disordered in their smallest matters. Marke good Reader, what is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of this swéet discourse, for it toucheth most néerelye our disordered Martinists, but we if we haue gotten a little glory and excellency of name, and haue learned two or thrée woords of Scripture, not often but by chaunce, and these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully and ill couched together; by and by we furiously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell against <hi>Moses,</hi> and followe the importune contumelye and impiety of <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram:</hi> whose contumelye I becéech you let vs flée, and let vs flée their madnes, least we be ouerthrowne with the same punishments. <hi>Nazianzene</hi> affirmeth that order is beautifull in naturall thinges in sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and in reasonable, but more beautifull in houses, Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and common weales, but most beautifull in the house and Church of God. For God is not the God of confusion but of order. <hi>1. Cor. 14. 33.</hi> And for this cause all thinges in the Church must be doone in order. <hi>1, Cor. 14. 40.</hi> Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 33. 1.

In these last and dangerous times like beastes voide of reason we despise gouerment, and like diuels
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4298:33"/>
that haue come out of the horrible pit of shameles confusion, we ouerthrowe all the orders which are established in the Church of England. Obedience by the woord of God is a sacrifice, but we holde it to be a superstitious yoke. S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayeth we should obey, not for feare of wrath but for consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: but now a daies they are accounted the holyest men, which haue no conscience, and doo stubbornlye resist all the orders of the Church, and desperately continue in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused disobedience, euery man will be a head, no man a foote, euery man a tung, no man a eare: S. <hi>Iames</hi> saith we should be slow to speak and swift to heare: but we haue peruerted his woords in our déeds, and are slowe to heare and swifte to speake against Prince and Ministers. And euen as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists wrote against <hi>Augustine</hi> in his time, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharoi against <hi>Ciprian</hi> in his time, aud as the Pharasies withstoode our Sauiour and his Apostles in their time: so are the Martinistes now bent against the Church of God and Ministers in our time. For as their hart is full of enuy, so their tung is as kéene as a rasour, as sharpe as a Swoord, as hotte as coles, asvenymous as vipers, and as they are swift to speak, without number, waight or measure of their woords, so are they slowe to heare: for they will not heare the voice of the charmer, charme he neuer of wiselye. Of these men <hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi> in the place before quoted saith very well: <q>it is a shame truelye when thou doost em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace not magnificence but basenes in thy apparrell and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and to pretend humilitye in the hardnes of thy knées, in thy fastings and watchings, and in the asperitye of thy bed being laide in the ground, and in thy labours, and in al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of pyning and subduing thy body: and to challenge to thy selfe a principalitye and tirannye in diuine disputations, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to yéeld to any man, but to aduance your self aboue the Preachers of the Law, where humility hath not only glory but also securitye. What then? will some of them which are of a hotte spirite obiect: doost thou by this Oration for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid

To whome I answere gentlye and<note place="margin">Sol.</note> without bitternes of minde, that héereby we may teach al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the moderation of the minde. I doo not exhorte a wise man to silence. but I studye to feare thée from stubborne conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: neither doo I bid thée to suppresse or hide the truth, but I forbid thée that thou teach not besides Lawe. For I my selfe doo professe my selfe to be a chéefe man among them which praise wisedome and learning, and either doo spend or desire to spend their times in holy Sermons and sacred stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and God graunt that I neuer be turned aways from this busines, least of wisedome it selfe I be pronounced a wretch and an vnhappy man, because I haue despised lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and wisedome. In the mean season I auoide the excesse and doo bridle the vnsatiable desire of man and am so minded, that if I could not auoide both faults and kéep a mediocrity, I had leyffer be too slowe then a busie body, or too fearful ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then too bolde or rash. He addeth shortly after, holde fast those woords, in the which thou hast béene instructed in thy infancy, commit the care of reasoning and disputation to the learned: it is inough for thée to holde fast the foundation, let a wise maister builder build vpon it: it is sufficient for thée to strengthen thy hart with bread, leaue dainty dishes to the rich and wealthye. No sober or wise man will accuse thée if thou furnish not thy supper with liberall and bountiful fare. But if thou wilt not set bread, or giue a cup of water to the Disciple of Christ. <hi>Mat. 10.</hi> Or to any other when thou art able, then art thon iustly and worthily condemned also. Be not swift in thy woords saith the wise man. <hi>Eccle. 5.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poore compare not thy selfe with the rich, &amp; affect not to be wiser the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wise. It is a poynt of wisedom to know thy

self, and not to be immoderately proud: and so to be affected as the voices who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are strained too high, by reson of the immoderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they do altogither faint.</q> Thus this auntie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t father perswaded the people of God to a moderation in his time, that knowledge might not make them proud: for pride is the cause of singularitye, singularitye bréedeth schismes, schismes disorder, disorder confusion. God saith in the <hi>4. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe.</hi> that he hath made vs Pastors and Doctors: héereby it is manifest that we are not the ordering or appointment of man, nor of angel, but of God himself. How dare euery man then being scarse skilfull in his owne mistery, take vpon him our office being in dignety the highest, in labours the paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest, in disposing the wisest, and in abusing the most daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous function of the worlde. Meate is common vnto all, but none can dresse it so well as Cookes: Cloth is common vnto all, but none know good and bad cloth so well as the Cloth maker: a swoord is necessarye, but none can vse it so well, as a skilfull maister of defence: so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> woord of God is to be read of all, but the desciding of controuersies pertaine to the learned ministers. If the vnlearned attempt to doo this, with the good meat of the woord of God they may surfeyte, and taking this swoorde by the pointe foolishlye, when they should discréetely take holde by the hyltes, they may hurte themselues vnrecouerably. For languishing about questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>1. Tim. 4.</hi> They are euer learning and neuer comming to knowledge. <hi>2. Tim. 3. 7.</hi> And as <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>2.

               <note place="margin">Athana. de in carnat: verbi.</note> saith in his Book of the incarnation of the woord, to teach all things exactly few men can, but to kéep the faith all men are bound.

               <p>Two arguments you make against <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome.</hi> The one is, they had errors, and therefore their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation not to be admitted.

The same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I make against all new writers. All new writers haue errors, and they liue in a most corrupt time, wherein (as Christ saith) <hi>shall be many false Prophets, and many false Christs, to deceiue the very elect if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, Math. 24. 24.</hi> Therefore because men are vaine, and the time corrupt, we must beléeue no man.

                  </hi> For <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Ierome</hi> to erre it is an accident, but the substance of all Fathers is to beget men in the word of truth, <hi>1.

doubt: but as I will not haue him to be geuen vnto me, so I will not haue him to be giuen to himselfe: let him not loue me more then the Catholike faith. As I say to him, beléeue not my sayings as Canonicall Scriptures, but beléeue sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly when thou hast found that which thou beléeuedst not, but beléeue not firmely that which thou hast not séene out of Gods word. So I say to him, do not correct my writings by thine owne opinion, or of contention, but by the word of God, &amp; by the reason thereof vncontrouleable.

                     </hi> I am not moued with the authoritie of this epistle, but I cousider them out of the Canonicall bookes, and if they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée with the word of God, I receiue them with praise, if they disagrée, I refuse them with peace.

Therefore they building vpon Christ aswell as your new, ought to be beléeued rather in this point than they: for what they wrote in this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy, the same did all other godly Interpreters both Gréek and Latin, hauing a good warrant from Gods word.

               <p>You write that <hi>Ierome</hi> &amp; <hi>Augustine</hi> did hold a palpable error, that is, that Christ descended to deliuer the Fathers. I hope you will not deny, but the Fathers haue their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance by Christ from hell, therefore by the merits and works of Christ, who I am sure conquered both death and hell. Therefore where you proue that <hi>Augustine</hi> &amp; <hi>Ierome</hi> do erre, I will leaue them as I said before, but wherein they speake the truth, I will praise God for them. But let vs see how many wayes the scripture may be corrupted, that is, by adding, altring, and diminishing. <hi>Eue</hi> in the third<note place="margin">The scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by 3. means</note> Chap. of <hi>Genesis</hi> taught all her childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so to do: for in the 3. verse thus she saith, <hi>But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, God hath said ye shal not eate</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4298:39"/>
                  <hi>of it, neither shall ye touch it least ye dye.</hi> First, she chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the word of God, for God sayth <hi>Gen. 2. 17. of the tree of knowledge of good and euill thou shalt not eate.</hi> Those words (of the trée of knowledge of good and euill) she changeth, &amp; putteth in for them (in the midst of the garden.) Farther God said, they should not eate of it, she added (that they might not touch it.) God said they should surely dye, <hi>Eue</hi> said (least we dye) héere she diminished the scriptures. If then the Fathers haue added to the scriptures, that the Fathers were set out of hell, there I leaue them. And if you change hell into graue, as you doo in the <hi>16. Psal,</hi> &amp; <hi>Act. 2.</hi> I will leaue you also: for I stande not vpon mens say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but vpon the word of God. But where you boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that not one of the Fathers haue déemed that which I say, you shewe your selfe either to be malicious in hiding the truth, or else so ignorant, that you haue not read the Fathers: for diuers both old and new are of my iudgement. <hi>Ambrose</hi> on the fourth Chapter of the <hi>Ephesians</hi> thus writeth. <q>Christ therefore comming downe from heauen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the earth, was borne a man, afterward he died, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into hell, from whence rising the third day, he shewed death vanquished to euery creature.</q> 
                  <hi>Augustine <hi>de tempore</hi>
                  </hi> in his 137. sermon, and in his third sermon of the resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thus sayth:<q> Hell did restore him as a conquerour, and the Heauens did receaue him as a triumpher. And in his second sermon he saith thus. Behold, you haue heard what our defender the God of vengeance is said to haue done frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For after that he was exalted, that is, was hanged of the <hi>Iewes</hi> on the crosse, that I may touch these things briefely, assoone as he had giuen vp the ghost, the soule vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the deuinitie, descended into the bottome of hell: and when he had touched the band of darkenesse as a fearefull and glorious spoyler, the wicked and hellish Legions were afrayde, and trembling, began to enquire, saying, Who is this dreadfull and glorious man? <hi>Eusebius</hi> writing of the resurrection of our Sauiour, hath the lyke: We must
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4298:39"/>
knowe that in the selfe same houre wherein our Sauiour bowing his head gaue vp the ghost, his body béeing left, in the graue, his Soule with the Diuinitie went downe, to triumph ouer Hell.</q> 
                  <hi>Fulgentius</hi> writing to King <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>symund</hi> in his third booke and eight Chapter, not drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming but well aduised, thus writeth: <q>The true humanitie of the Sonne of God neyther was wholie in the graue, nor wholie in Hell, but in the Sepulcher he lay dead ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his true fleshe, but in his Soule descended into Hell. In his Soule he returned to the flesh which lay in the Sepulcher, but in respect of the Deuinitie, which ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is holden in place, nor limited by bond, he was who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in the graue with his flesh, and wholie with his Soule in Hell. And by this meanes was fully euery where Christ, because God was not seperated from the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie which he had assumpted, which was both with his Soule in Hell, that from Hell his Soule might returne a Conqueresse, and was with his flesh, that by reason of his spéedie resurrection, it might not be corrupted.</q> I haue héere alleaged the olde which disprooue your assertion, for all these accord with mée. Now to these will I adde also the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of some newe Writers. <hi>Mollerus</hi> a very learned Minister of <hi>Germany,</hi> on the 16. Psalme, thus teacheth: <q>Christ would shewe his victorie in a certaine sort ouer the Diuells to strike perpetuall terrors into them, and to take away from vs the feare of their tyrannie. To this agréeth <hi>Musculus</hi> on the sixtie and eight Psalme. This GOD which was in Christ, reconciling the world to himselfe, first descended into the lowest partes of the earth, then he led captiuitie captiue, and not only wée are deliuered from the captiuitie of Satan, sinne, and damnation, but also triumphing ouer them as Tyrants, he hath ascended aboue all heauens to fulfill all things.</q> The same learned Father interpreting the second Chapter of the <hi>Colossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> thus hath: <q>There are some that be perswaded it is an absurditie, if it be sayd that Christ did triumph ouer
<pb facs="tcp:4298:40"/>
the principalities and powers, but if all these things be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God the Father, that he did them with Christ, and in Christ, we may truly reade héere, triumphing ouer them in his owne person.</q> In like sort dooth <hi>Hemingius</hi> expounde this place in the second Chapter of the <hi>Colos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians:</hi> 
                  <q>As by his death he conflicted with the Diuell on the Crosse, so by his glorious descending into Hell, Resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Ascention, he triumphed, as it is <hi>Ephes. 4.</hi> leauing his Crosse lift vp as a monument of his victorie.</q> So doth <hi>M. Fox</hi> vnderstand this place in a booke which hée hath written, entituled, <hi>Christus triumphans.</hi> Therefore in this behalfe you haue tolde a manifest vntruth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall thinke you will scarce haue care to set forth the truth of God, when you will presumptuously vtter such an vntruth, which may be reproued by so many and honourable witnesses. Farther, héere you leaue out at your pleasure two other endes of Christs descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into Hell, which I taught in my Sermon: the one is, the manifestation of his death, the other is, our deliuerance from Hell. Playne dealing ought to be in this case, and therefore I exspect it at your hands.</p>

               <p>But if you will see how doubtfull <hi>Augustine</hi> was in this point, I pray you reade his 99. Epistle to <hi>Euodius,</hi> where you shall finde many his doubts and almost no other thing affyrmed for certaintie, but only that hee doubteth not that Christ went to Hell, building vpon the wordes of the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the Apostle Saint <hi>Peter: Thou wilt not leaue my Soule in Hell, nor suffer thy holie one to see corruption.</hi> Where I can not choose but wonder what should moue so worthy a wit, and so learned followers of him, seing it is apparant that the word doth signifie aswell the sorrowes of hell, as the place of hell in the scripture to passe by that significatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:4298:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the word, which the whole church of Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth to be true, that our Sauiour did suffer vpon the Crosse whole torments of hell for our redemption, and to fall vpon that signification which hath slender proofe, and led them iuto such streites as <hi>Augustine</hi> himselfe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not escape. Whosoeuer doubteth that the name of hell is vsed in the Scripture, for those sorrowes let him read that of 1. Samuel 2. 6. <hi>The Lord killeth and makaeth aliue, he casteth downe to hell and bringeth vp againe.</hi> Or that of Dauid Psal. 30. 3. <hi>Thou hast brought my soule out of Hell.</hi> Or that of Ionas 2. 2. <hi>I haue called to thee out of the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of hell.</hi> And many other places, where the woord can not signifie the pit of hell, whence there is no redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the sorrowes of hell which the Saintes of God did suffer in this life. Now seeing this is so, I would fain know of you (good M. Hill) why we may not more safely take the woord Hell in that signification, which you cannot deny, then you in that signification, which the better parte of Christians do take to be false. For that Christ descended into the pit of the damned, it hath no other warrant out of the woord, but such as is builded vpon a woord of a double signification, which standeth at the curtesie of the reader to take it as to him shall seeme probable.</p>

He doubteth whether the Fathers were in hell, or whether they were conuerted in hell by Christs preaching, as some did affirme vntruly, and many such like thinges, little or nothing appertaining to the question we

You say that hell signifieth the sorrowes of hell, sometime I graunt it dooth: Héereupon you make this argument: sometime it signifieth the sorrowes of hell, therfore it dooth so in the 16. Psalme. I deny your argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and that you haue spoken an vntruth, the holy Ghoste by <hi>Peters</hi> mouth shalbe a witnes against you. For you say it is spoken of the sorrowes which Christ suffered vpon the crosse, <hi>Peter</hi> saith it is spoken of the resurrection: and in the resurrection I am sure Christ suffred no tormentes or sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes. <hi>Peters</hi> interpretation is thus, <hi>Act. 2. 32. He knowing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soule should not be left in hell, neither his flesh to see corruption.</hi> Now then héere is an answere to your demaund: these woords are spoken of the resurrection, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ioy and not of torments, for <hi>Dauid</hi> saith in the person of Christ, <hi>Therefore did my hart reioyce, and my tung was glad. And moreouer also my flesh shal rest in hope.</hi> If Christ at this time did reioyce, how was he sorrowfull? if he were glad, how was he tormented? if he did rest in hope, how was it true also that he was afflicted with torments? And héere you vtter another vntruth, that Christ did svffer his whole torments on the crosse, which is most vntrue: for he suffered some in the Garden, when he said, <hi>Math. 26. 38.

house, aud some vnder <hi>Pilat:</hi> but all his torments and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes were ended on the crosse, which I think you would haue said. Last of all the woords of the text that commeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, aswell as the woords going before do proue, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be spoken of Christs sorrowes, for they are these. <hi>Thou shalt shew me the path of life, in thy presence is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ioy, and at thy right hand are pleasures for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> Sith then <hi>Dauid</hi> both before and after maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ioy and pleasures for euermore, and as <hi>Peter</hi> saith these woordes proue the resurrection of Christ: I maruaile how you dare to contradict the meaning of the holy Ghoste.

               <p>That he neuer was there, what better proofe would a man aske then Christs own woords? Luc. 23. 46. <hi>Father into thy hands I commend my spirite.</hi> And in another place Luk. 23. 43. <hi>This day shalt thou be with me in Paradice.</hi> Where it is a world to see how men of your side do trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themselues to put out this candle.

sence as Dauid did vse it before him. This we confesse and gather hereupon, that Christs soule did no more descend into hel then Dauids did: but say you his soule did not straite way ascend into heauen, for he liued ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeeres after. That maketh not to the question when his soule went to heauen, but whether his soule which was still in the hands of God, euer went to hell, proue this and we will giue you the goale. As for Dauid he hauing deuoured heauen in hope, did not doubt to speake that in the present time which he was sure would come to passe shortly. Furthermore seeing Dauid was a figure of Christ, and spake many thinges of himselfe in Christs person, (which were more agreeable with the thing figured then with the figure) you must think that these wordes were spoken of Christ, who was straite way to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend his soule with these words vnto his Father. Wherfore if you will answere this place, you must bring proof out of the Scriptures, that he which meanes to go to hell, doth vse to commend his soule into the handes of God, or els you shal neuer be able to darken the light of this Sonne without any cloud of Sophistry.</p>

                  <hi>Father into thy hands I wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit my spirite.</hi> Now your argument is thus: Christ commended his soule vnto his Father, <hi>ergo</hi> immediatlye he went not downe to hell. Héere is more in your conclusion then is in your premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. You may conclude his soule went to heauen. But not immedlatly: for it went to hell as I haue proued before, for hell in the 16. Psalme, doth not signifie the sorrowes of hel, but the place as I haue confirmed already. Therefore it is better to translate I will commend, then I doo commend,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4298:42"/>
as <hi>Stepanus</hi> on this place noteth. <hi>Paule</hi> sayth <hi>Eph. 4.</hi> and 10. verse, <hi>Now in that he ascended, what is it but that he first descended into the lowest parts of the earth. He that descended is euen the same that ascended farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all heauens, to fulfill all things.</hi> Now if the same Christ did first descend which did ascend, then he descended in soule and body, as he ascended in soule and body. For both these must be effected in a wonderfull maner, for they are reconed by <hi>Salomon</hi> amongst the most stupendious works of the Sonne of God. <hi>Prou. 30. 4. Who hath ascended vp to heauen, &amp; descended? who hath gathered the winde together in his fyst? who hath established all the ends of the world?</hi> By this scripture I inferre, that to ascend and descend are as miraculous works as to create &amp; gouern the world. But if the soule of Christ did go to heauen imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly as you affirme contrary to this text, then the descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Christ had not bin so maruelous as his ascending. Besides, as you after alleage, there is but one ascending, but if Christs soule first went to heauen, and then his body, then were there two ascensions. But euen as Christ was but once borne and once dyed and was once buried and once rose from the dead, and but once commeth into iudgement: so as <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith in his Sermon of the ascending of Christ,<q> Christ did once descend into hell, they shall sée God no more on the crosse, nor they that are damned in hell.</q> Wherefore may it please you to accept the iudgement of <hi>Athanasius</hi> a Gréeke Father, and a man persecuted for the truths sake by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> he in his Créede saith thus, <q>who suffred for our saluation, and descended into hell.</q> And interpreting the third Chapter of the first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he writeth,<q> Satan was enuious against our Sauiour, for he killed him, not knowing that it would make against himself, for Christ after his crosse going downe into hell, hath va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quished death, &amp; because he knew not sinne, he could not be holden of death.</q> Thus you sée, that not only <hi>Hill, Augustine &amp; Ierome</hi> doo say, that Christ after he had vtterd these words (into thy
<pb facs="tcp:4298:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hands I will commend my spirit) but <hi>Athanasius</hi> a gréeke father, who better then you, vnderstood the meaning of these words. Therfore it is a wonder to sée how those of your side labour to extinguish this euerlasting light of Gods truth, and set vp a consuming candle of your owne making. Where you teach that Christs Soule did no more descend into hell then <hi>Dauids</hi> did, therein you are deceaued, for Christ was to deliuer vs from hell and <hi>Dauid</hi> also: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Christs soule had not gone to hell, <hi>Dauids</hi> must, and mine and yours. And for this cause as you say they are true in Christ figured, but not in <hi>Dauid</hi> the figure. And héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon <hi>Peter</hi> thus reasoneth, that they could not be true in <hi>Dauid.</hi> For Christs soule was in hell, and yet not tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and his body in the graue, but not corrupted. Whereas <hi>Dauids</hi> body saw corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and if his soule had gone to hell it had found no redemption. Therefore to be in graue and returne without corruption, and to be in hell and returne with conquest of the diuell, were two peculiar things to the Sonne of God, and not to any other of the sonnes of men. And héere you vtter an other blasphemy that Christs soule had no other prerogatiue then <hi>Dauids</hi> soule, for by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same reason you may argue that Christs body had no greater prerogatiue then <hi>Dauids</hi> body, for as this is false, so is the other. For as <hi>Athanasius</hi> saith in his booke of the incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word, <q>Death could not preuaile on the humane soule of Christ to tye him there, neither corruption inuading his body by tiranny could shew her force on him to putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as things not well séene vnto, for to thinke so of him, so, were a wicked thing: for euen as <hi>Adam</hi> had a double pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment inflicted on him for his disobedience, the one was on his body, earth thou art, and to earth thou shalt returne, and so by this decrée the body of the Lord departed vnto the earth: but to the soule he said, Thou shalt dye the death. Hereof it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to passe that man is deuided into 2. parts, and is condemned to depart to 2. places, and therfore it was necessary that the selfesame Iudge which had made this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crée,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4298:43"/>
that he by himselfe being vnder the colour of a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, should frée from that sentence all beléeuers.</q> Héere you sée by this learned Father, that Christs soule went to hell to deliuer our soules from hell, and his body to the graue to deliuer vs from death, and by this meanes both body and soule personally and not potentially (as you teach) working our deliuerance from death &amp; hell, haue those prerogatiues which <hi>Dauids</hi> soule and body had not. And for this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration though the one was in the graue, &amp; the other in hell, yet both were in the hands of the Lord. Héere then we must learne what the hands of the Lord do signifie. Sometime the hand of God doth signifie the Sonne of God, <hi>Psal. 144. 7. Send thy hand from aboue.</hi> Sometime it signifieth the power of God, <hi>Psalm. 136. 12. With a mighty hand, and outstretched arme.</hi> Thirdly the bountifulnes of God, <hi>Psal. 145. Thou openest thy hand, and fillest euery li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thing with thy blessing.</hi> Fourthly it signifieth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, <hi>Ezec. 3. 22. The hand of the Lord was with me comforting me.</hi> Fiftly grace, <hi>Psalm. 118. 16. The right hand of the Lord hath done valiantly.</hi> Sixtly it signifieth the gift of prophecie, <hi>Ezec. 8. 1.

I hope you your selfe commende your soule into the hands of God euery day, but yet you minde not to goe to heauen immediatly. So said <hi>Dauid, Psal. 30. 5. Into thine hands I commende my spirit,</hi> but
<pb facs="tcp:4298:44"/>
he went not to heauen in many yeares after, neither did Christ ascend into heauen in many dayes after, but went downe to hell, where it was in the protection and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Godhead, which as you confesse descended into hell. For as we being in the damned world, are in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and hand of the highest, so Christ being in the place of the damned, after a wonderfull manner was also in the Lords aide and protection, by meanes whereof he hath wrought our deliuerance from hell. Therefore proue you that Christ went straitway to heauen, and you shall effect that which many of your side haue attempted, but neuer yet any could bring to passe. It is written of <hi>Procustes</hi> that if any were too short for his bed, he would stretch them out, and make them fit for his lodging: so you, this place being too short to fit your waste, will enlarge it with a word (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly) which is not in the place primitiue or deriuatiue, expressely, or by way of implication. Moreouer where you say, if I will aunswere this place I must proue that he that mindeth to goe to hell, doth vse these words. I wonder that you dare vse such blasphemous spéeches, for hereby you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate that Christ was but a méere man, and that other men haue a part in the worke of our redemption aswell as Christ. For as he is our only Sauiour, so as <hi>Luther</hi> saith on <hi>Gen. 21.</hi> Chapter. <q>This was singular in Christ (Thou shalt not leaue my soule in hell, nor suffer thy holy one to sée corruption,) for his soule could not be deteined in hell, nor his body in the graue.</q> For as this was singuler in Christ that he did giue vp his ghost, so was it singular in him to go to hell and returne againe. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <q>
                     <hi>
                        <hi>Tradidit spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum suum quia non inuitus amisit, quod enim emittitur vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarium est, quod amittitur necessarium.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </q> He gaue vp the ghost because he lost not his soule against his will: for that which is emitted is voluntarie, but that which is amitted is necessary. <hi>Theophilact</hi> saith,<q> he cryed out with a loude voice &amp; gaue vp the ghost, for he had power to lay down his life, &amp; take it vp again.</q> Now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you can proue that you or

any of your side haue this power in you to dye when he will, and liue againe when he will, then will I prooue that he that speaketh these wordes (Into thy hands I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende my spirit) hath an intent to goe to Hell. But as Christ his birth was a singular thing in him, so was his death buriall, descending into hell, resurrection, and ascention into heauen. <hi>Eccle. 8. 8. Man is not Lord ouer the spirite, to retaine the spirite.</hi> Aud <hi>Iohn 10. 18.</hi> Christ saith, <hi>No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it downe of my selfe: I haue power to lay it downe, and power to take it vp againe.</hi> By these two places it is euident, that no man can lay down his owne spirite, but the only Sonne of God had that prerogatiue, and therefore as the laying downe of his spirite and the taking vp of his spirite againe was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull: so was the state of the soule and body during the time of the seperation of the partes of the humanity, singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and wonderfull.</p>

                  </hi> Héere <hi>Dauid</hi> and the Apostle doo take this woord (to day) to signifie (for euer). And so dooth S. <hi>Augustine</hi> and M. <hi>Hill</hi> against all the gainsaiers of it in the world: For the circumstances of the place doo strongly conuince it. For what doth the théefe aske? forgiuenes of his sinnes: who can forgiue sinnes? God onely. He asketh for grace, who is the giuer of all Grace? God only? he desireth glory, who giueth glory and life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting? God only. That God only forgiueth sinnes, it is proued <hi>Mar. 2. 7.</hi> That he is the giuer of all grace, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest <hi>1.

Secondly where shall he receiue this glorye? in Paradice. For as much then as the thing that is giuen is eternall, the person that giueth it is perpetuall, the place where it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb facs="tcp:4298:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is euerlasting: it must of necessitie follow that the time also be world without end. And that (with me) signifieth as I doo teach the Godhaad: <hi rend="margQuotes">it is constantlye auouched by all the Fathers. <hi>Ierome</hi> on this place noteth. Christ brought the théefe from the crosse to Paradice, least any man should think conuersion to be too late at any time: he made the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of homicide Martirdome: the truth being counted among the wicked, he left the one in the left hand, and tooke the other in the right hand, as he will doo in the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It were an absurd thing to say the soule of Christ on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall giue iudgement in the last day. <hi>Augustine</hi> hath the like on this place, The crosse if you mark it was the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seate, the Iudge was set in the middle, the one théefe which beléeued was deliuered, the other which blasphemed was condemned. To saue and condemne is the office of the deity, and therfore (with me) signifieth the Godhead, as the other théefe no doubt was with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Diuell. <hi>Ambrose</hi> in his Sermon of the holy théefe writeth thus: <q>He saw him han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging on the crosse and praieth to him as though he were sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in heauen: he seeth him condemned, and yet he prayeth vnto him as to a king. To this accordeth <hi>Damascene</hi> hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this place. In respect of his bodye he was in graue, in respect of his soule in hell: and as God he was both in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice with the theefe, and in the throne with the Father and the holy Ghoste.</q> Therefore <hi>Ferus</hi> a writer not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, interpreteth these woordes thus. <q>
                        <hi>

Twise you haue told me that (thou shalt be with me) is as much as (I and thou) but you bring neither scripture nor father to confirme it in that sense that you meane it. But if you meane thus I and thou shall be together, that is, thou shalt be pertaker of the glory of the deitie, as thou hast bin pertaker of the suffrings with the humanitie it is true. For what néede had the théefe to pray for the presence of Christs soule, when he had the presence both of body and soule. But it is the presence and fellowship of the deuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that he prayeth for, wherein as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, is <hi>the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ioy and pleasures for euermore, Psal. 16. 11.</hi> In <hi>Luke. 13. 26.</hi> The <hi>Iewes</hi> say, <hi>We haue eaten and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in thy presence, and thou taught in our streetes.</hi> Christ thus aunswereth in the 27. and 28. verses. <hi>I tel you I know you not, depart from me all ye workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you shal see <hi>Abraham Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and your selues cast out of dores.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>But now to come to your reasons. First, you make much adoo about the Hebrew names of Hell, against almost all the learned of this age.

Only I stand vpon this which I haue sayd, that this word Hell doth signify the torments of the soule, and must needes in these places which you alleage be so taken, for in the place of <hi>Psal. 16. 10. Thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell, nor suffer thy holy one to see corruption.</hi> The very order of the words do ouerthrow your conceit: for seeing in these words the hell which his soule should not be left in, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before Christs buriall, wherein that holy one <hi>should not see corruption,</hi> tell you me what hell should go before Christs buriall but that of the passion, wherein he payd the full raunsome of our saluation, and nayled the hand writing that was against vs to the Crosse.</p>

               <p>Two vntruthes are in these few words. First you say I make much adoo about <hi>Sheol</hi> against almost all the learned men of this age. There are on my side <hi>Luther, Aepinus, Felinus, Pomeranus, Lucas Lossius, Selueccer, Vrbanus Rhegius,</hi> The authors of the <hi>Centuries, Erasmus, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traeus, Mollerus, Peter Martyr, Lauaterus, Prouerb. 27.</hi> In <hi>
                     <hi>England</hi> Lambert, Robert Samuel, Latimer, Becon, Hutchinson, Fox, and Nowell.</hi> Héere are 20. most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men of these latter times, as I can shewe you in my poore Library, besides that most learned and reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>M. Allen,</hi> and besides the aduised iudgement of the learned Conuocations of <hi>England</hi> not only in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> raigne, <hi>Anno Domini. 1552.</hi> but also since the raigne of her Maiestie. <hi>1571.</hi> In the which Conuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I am perswaded were as learned men as any were either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Europe.</hi> Therefore the learned reader must either thinke you a man of little reading, and that you neuer sawe these learned mens workes, or else of great malice, that you will disable all these for learning, who left a better testimonie behinde them then euer you will, vnlesse you haue more then you haue shewed in this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere. The other vntruth is, that <hi>Sheol</hi> in the <hi>16.</hi> Psalme doth signifye the torments of hell, which Christ suffred in his passion on the crosse. That this is vntrue it is manifest<note place="margin">M. Humes disagreeth with Saint Peter.</note> not by conceit, but by <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, <hi>Act <hi>2, 31.</hi> Hee knowing this before spake of the resurrection, that his soule was not left in hell, nor his flesh sawe corruption:</hi> You say it is spoken of the passion, <hi>Peter</hi> saith it is spoken of the resurrection: and good cause hath he so to say, for the words going before and comming after doo prooue it. The wordes going before are these, <hi>
                     <hi>Psalm. 16, 9.</hi> Wherefore my hart was glad, my glory reioyseth, my flesh also shall rest in hope:</hi> The words following in the <hi>11.</hi> verse
<pb facs="tcp:4298:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are these: <hi>Thou shalt shewe me the path of life, in thy presence is the fulnes of ioy, and at thy right hand are pleasures for euermore.</hi> Where can you finde your tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the word (glad) or in the word (reioiseth) or in the word (rest) or in these words (fulnesse of ioy) or in these (pleasures for euermore.) Was Christ glad of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Did he reioise or wéepe in them? Who would deliuer this doctrine but he that wanteth either science or conscience, or both. To lye once is a fault, but to affirme it twice is a greater fault. To speake a lye is hurtfull, but to write a lye aduisedly is more hurtfull. To lye in a matter politicall is dangerous, but to lye in deuine matters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spéedie repentance is damnable. You say no vantage is geuen to me nor inconuenience to you, if you graunt <hi>Sheol</hi> to be Hell: Let your friends iudge what vantage you haue geuen to the truth, and shame to your selfe by gainsaying Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and by affirming, that in the resurrection are torments, where <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> say are fulnes of ioy and pleasures for euermore. Therefore it is the saying of <hi>Peter,</hi> that Christs soule was not left in hell, and not my conceit, and it is deceit in you to affirme the contrary. Further where you say that <hi>Tremellius</hi> and <hi>Iunius</hi> are better learned in the Hebrew language then my selfe, I confesse it, so are the <hi>Iewes</hi> themselues then <hi>Tremellius</hi> and <hi>Iunius,</hi> shall I therefore beléeue the <hi>Iewes?</hi> no more will I beléeue the Translation of any other learned man, if hée disagrée with <hi>Dauid</hi> and Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to aunswere your curious question, you aske me in what hell was Christs soule before his buriall? To this I answere, in that hell whither all Infidels goe for their vnbeliefe. I reade but of one Hell, if you knowe any more let me sée your proofe, and then will I tell you into what hell Christ descended. But who but you doth thinke it an vnpossible thing for a soule to descend into hell before the body be buried? The soule in an instant passeth to heauen or hell, but the body I am sure must haue time to be buried: for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4298:48"/>
bodies are in places circumscriptiuely, Angels and soules definitiuely, and God is in all places vniuersally. And the soule came out of hell into the body, before the body could come out of the graue: therefore most aptly it is saide <hi>Acts 12. 31. Thou shalt not leaue my soule in hell, nor suffer my flesh to see corruptiou.</hi> For as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith in his 57. epistle <hi>ad Dardanum,</hi>
                  <q> That was spoken of his soule which came from hell so quickly, this of his body which could not corrupt by reason of his spéedy resurrection: and writing on the 85. Psalme he saith: wherefore this is his voice in the Psalme not by any mans coniecture, but by the expasition of th'apostle, Thou shalt not leaue my soule in hell, nor suffer thy holy one to sée corruption.</q>

               <p>Therefore to let this passe, your next reason is from that place of Paule Ephe. 4. 9. <hi>Now in that he ascended, what is it but that descended first into the lowermost partes of the earth.</hi> Where you holde out of the Hebrew, that the lowermost partes of the earth must needs signifie the pit of hell: which thing if it were so sure as you beare vs in hand, then were it a wonder that no diuine (I speake of the modester sort) did euer yet gather vpon that place hell, which they dare not dispute, where it were in the very center of the earth. But whereas you auouch so confidently, that <hi>Erets tacthioth</hi> doth signifie hel, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the Hebrew tung, as our English name Hell is vsuall for that place among vs: though I meane not to stand with you for the tung, giue me leaue to dissent from you in this, for in some of the places which you cite, in my simple vnderstanding it cannot carrye that sence. You quote the 63. Psal. <hi>They which seeke my soule, shall go into the lowermost partes of the earth.</hi> This I think cannot be hell, for first it were a presumption for the Prophet to enter so farre into Gods secrets, as to iudge
<pb facs="tcp:4298:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his enemies. 2. It standeth not (me thinketh) with the affection of a godly minde to assigne that place to his enemies, out of the horror whereof there is no redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the children of God do rather pray for their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies and wish their amendment. This place may wel be construed of the graue, and in my simple iudgement it is an argument to lay the pride of them which sought his soule, and a comfort to himselfe, that their enmitye must needs haue an end one daye, when the graue shall deuoure them. The woordes following confirme this sence. <hi>They shall fall on the edge of the Swoord.</hi> Psal. 63. which cannot be spoken but of temporall death.</p>

               <p>Indéede I brought this place <hi>Ephe. 49<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to proue that Christ descended into Hell. And whereas you charge me with immodesty for so alleadging of it, I must néeds charge you with two vntruthes in answering this allegation. The one is, that I called it the pit of Hell, which phrase I neuer vsed: The other is, you haue impudently auouched, that none of the modester sorte of deuines haue euer alleadged this place to proue the descending of Christ into hel. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and those both learned and modest haue alleadged this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> place to this purpose. <hi>Athanasius</hi> interpreting this Epistle and text thus writeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <q>Into what place did he descend? Into hell truely, which he calleth according to the common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, the lowest partes of the earth.</q> 
                  <hi>Ambrose</hi> on this place saith thus. <q>This Christ therfore comming down from heauen into the earth was borne a man, afterward he dyed &amp; descended into hell, from whence rising the third day, he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vp to heauen before all mortall men, that he might shewe death to be vanquished to euery creature. <hi>Chrisostome</hi> on this place saith. He went to those partes of the earth, then the which nothing is lower, and from thence he ascended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, then the which nothing is higher. The like hath

                     <hi>Augustine li. de Trin. cap. 19. Ierome</hi> on this text thus noteth. That Hell is vnder the earth no man doubteth, for he that descended in soule into hell, ascended both bodye and soule into heauen. </q>
                  <hi>Mollerus</hi> a learned Minister of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> on the sixtéene Psalme saith: that the descending into hel is plainely proued out of the <hi>Ephesians</hi> the fourth chapter. <hi>Musculus</hi> on the <hi>68. Psal.</hi> thus writeth. <q>This God which was in Christ reconciling the worlde vnto himselfe, first des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into the lowest partes of the earth, then he led capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie captiue, and not only we are deliuered from the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity of Satan, sinne, death and damnation: but also Christ triumphing ouer them as tirants, hath ascended aboue all heauens, to fulfill all things:</q> 
                  <hi>Hemingius</hi> on the 2. Chapter to the <hi>Colossians</hi> thus also teacheth. <q>As by his deathe he conflicted with the enemye on the crosse, so by his glorious descending into hel, resurrection and ascention, he triumphed as it is <hi>Ephe</hi> 4. Leauing his crosse lift vp as a monument of his victory.</q> To conclude, <hi>Alesius</hi> a very learned preacher of Scotland, on the 19. chapter of Iohn, affirmeth that the <hi>1. Pet. 3.</hi> and <hi>Eph. 4.</hi> do manifestly proue the descending of Christ into hell, if <hi>Athanasius, Chrysostome, Ambrose, Augustine</hi> and <hi>Ierome,</hi> of the olde fathers, and <hi>Mollerus, Musculus, Hemingius</hi> and <hi>Alesius</hi> of the new writers: be all immodest diuines, then haue you truelye saide: but if in the iudgement of the learned, all these were most reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend men, then most shameles are you to accuse them of the want of modesty. Moreouer where you saye no deuine da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to dispute where hell is: it is true in some sorte, for no deuine can circumscribe the place of hell which is infinite, nor yet of heauen: only the woord of God affirmeth that heauen is aboue, <hi>Gal. 4. 26.</hi> And hell is beneath, <hi>Prouerbs 15. 24.</hi> Therefore the lowest partes of the earth may well be taken for hell: Then you goe farther and say, that <hi>Erets tachthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth</hi> doth not signifie hel, <hi>Psal. 63.</hi> and for this you bring two reasons: the one is, that it were a presumption in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to iudge his enemies: 2, that it standeth not with the
<pb facs="tcp:4298:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
affection of a godly minde, to assigne hell to his enemies, but to pray for them: to your first reason this I answere. In the Psalme <hi>9. 18. Dauid</hi> vseth the like spéeche: <hi>The wicked shall be turned to hell, and all the people that forget God:</hi> which text <hi>Caluin</hi> thus expoundeth, the Hebrewe woord <hi>Sheolah</hi> which was doubtfull, I haue not doubted to translate hell, for though it doth not displease me that others turne it (Sepulcher) yet it is sure héere is something noted besides common death, otherwise he should speak nothing of the reprobate, but that which did generally happen to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeuers. In the hnndred and ninth Psalme also <hi>Dauid</hi> thus praieth: <hi>Let Satan stand at his right hand, let his prayer be turned iuto sinne, let the wickednes of his Father be had in remembrance in the sight of the Lord, and let not the sinne of his mother be done away.</hi> Do you think this to be spoken presumptuously? Many such texts could I alleadge to proue that <hi>Dauid</hi> inspired with the spirite of prophecye, did foretell not onely of the tragicall destruction of bodies of his enemies, but also of the extreme damnation of their soules. This then is my replye to your second reason: these enemies were not priuate enemies, but publique, and did hate <hi>Dauid</hi> for his religions sake: <hi>Dauid</hi> therefore by the gift of prophecye doth foretell, that their soules should go to hell to be tormented, and their bodies should be the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Foxes, that is, should neuer come to the graue, for what néed <hi>Dauid</hi> tell vs they should dye, which we know is common to all? or how can that betrue which you say, that they should be in graue, when <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe saith they were not in any graue, but were the portion of Foxes. And<note place="margin">Humes disa greeth with Dauid and Caluin.</note> so M. <hi>Caluin</hi> (whom I hope you will beléeue) teacheth you, writing vpon this Psalme and verse. To be the portion of Foxes, is as much as to be deuoured and torne of wicked beastes: for God (saith <hi>Caluin</hi>) doth threaten this: punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the reprobate, that they shall be a pray to Wolues and dogges, because he would depriue them of the honor of their graue. Héer you sée M. <hi>Caluin</hi> saith they came not into
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4298:50"/>
their graue, you say they did. How <hi>M. Caluin</hi> and you may be reconciled I knowe not: for <hi>Caluin</hi> addeth this reason. <q>It hapneth sometime that we know the same temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments to be common to the good &amp; the bad: but this is the difference, the bones of the godly are gathered together and kept in safety, that not one of them shall perish, but the scattring of the bones of the reprobate is a signe of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall destruction.</q> Therefore how can the lower partes of the earth signifie the graue as you say, since (as <hi>M. Calùin</hi> truly saith) they were in no graue: Aunswere me this (good <hi>M. Humes</hi>) plainely. <hi>Psal. 63, 9.</hi> The lower parts of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth signifie (not the graue) but hell. Christ descended into the lower parts of the earth, <hi>Eph. 4. 9. <hi>Ergo</hi>

               <p>First you say, the place quoted by me <hi>Syrac. 24. 37.</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not for the proofe of my assertion. If you had conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what went before, and what followeth, you would haue bin of another minde.

                  </hi> the depth of death and hell.

For the place in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> that it maketh most significantly for my purpose, I will proue it by <hi>Esay, Ezechiel,</hi> and diuers other both learned &amp; modest writers. <hi>Esay</hi> handling the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, saith <hi>14, 9.

Sith then both the prophets call it hell, how dare you to interpret it graue. But that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermost parts of the earth do signify hell, I prooue it out of the 12. ver. of <hi>Ezechiel. And the strangers haue destroyd him euen the terrible nations, and they haue left him vpon the mountaines, and in all the valleis his branches are broken. Munster</hi> on this place saith, <q>that by the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are vnderstoode the carcasses of his hoast which the beasts of the field did deuoure. <hi>Lauaterus</hi> the Minister of <hi>Tigurine</hi> agréeth with him. All the beasts of the field shall dwell vpon his ruine: the kings carkas shall not be laid vp into the sepulcher of his elders, but shal be a pray to crowes, griphins, and to other carniuorous birds. So doth <hi>Pellican</hi> a learned <hi>Linguist</hi> interpret this place. At the last there is an auersion or apostrophe to <hi>Pharao</hi> himselfe, or to the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syrian King. To whom art thou likened O thou noble and high among the trées of pleasure, thou hast passed all other in power, and yet with other kings that were in thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany they were brought to the lowermost parts of the earth (that is) to hell, among the abhominable heathen shalt thou sléepe, and lye as a wretched and miserable man.</q> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you take hold of the word sléepe, you must remember that these words are spoken ironically, as it is noted in the contents of the 14. Chap. of <hi>Esay. The derision of the king of Babilon.</hi> Moreouer <hi>Lauaterus</hi> on this place of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saith: <q>These things may be better vnderstood out of the 14. Chap. of <hi>Esay,</hi> which prophecying of the destruction of the king of <hi>Babilon Baltassar,</hi> describeth with what bitter

scoffs he is entertained in hell. To ende, <hi>Lauaterus</hi> on this place proueth these foure things, first, that there is an hell, secondly, that hell in this chapter is called by thrée names, that is, <hi>1. Sheol, 2. Erets Tacthioth, 3.</hi> and <hi>Bor.</hi> Hell, the lowest parts of the earth, and a pit: thirdly, that this hell is beneath vs: and lastly, that the tyrants and wicked of the world doo descend into it, and this he proueth out of <hi>Numb.</hi> the <hi>16, 33. Psal 55, 15.</hi> And addeth also that <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Ierome</hi> doo prooue hell to be beneath in the earth.</q> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion then is thus, forasmuch then as the <hi>Assyrians</hi> dyed with the sword, &amp; were deuoured of the beasts &amp; birds of the field, I pray tell me how that can be true that you affirme that the lowest partes of the earth doth signifye the graue: for how were they in the graue that were neuer buried: therefore they were in hell as both <hi>Esay</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel</hi> doo affirme, and as <hi>Pellican, Munster,</hi> and <hi>Lauater,</hi> thrée no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table learned men in the holy toong doo interpret it. I thinke your owne friends when they reade this will confesse you either to be ignorant of the word of God, or else to wrest it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the meaning of the holie ghost. Moreouer, where you mislike with me because I said that <hi>

                  </hi> that is, the lowermost parts of the earth doth signifye hell generally in the Hebrew toong, and you bring an instance out of the <hi>139.

In a metaphoricall signification it signifieth the mothers womb, therefore in his proper signification it can not signifie hell. <hi>
                     <hi>Argumentum a metaphora ductum non va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi>
                  </hi> an argument drawen from a metaphore is of no force. And that héere is a metaphor, <hi>M. Caluin</hi> shalbe the iudge. <q>He compareth (saith <hi>Caluin</hi>) the mothers wombe to the lowest and inward dens of the earth: and a little after, for no doubt <hi>Dauid</hi> would expresse metaphorically that inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable cunning which appeareth in the figure of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s body. The mothers womb is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to hel for the darknes of it:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4298:52"/>
for as <hi>Caluin</hi> saith, that artificer which maketh a cunning péece of work in a darke place is more to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended then he which doth the like in the light.</q> 
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> also is here said to be made in the nethermost partes of the earth, because he was by nature the child of wrath &amp; of hell, if he had not bin deliuered therehence by Iesus Christ. Bréefely, where you say that he descended into the Uirgins wombe, and that it is the true meaning of the place <hi>Eph. 4. 9.</hi> both you and your Maister B. are deceaued. For <hi>Paul</hi> reproueth you <hi>Ephe. 4. 10. He that descended is euen the same that ascended.</hi> Now the body and soule of Christ ascended into heauen, therefore the body and soule of Christ descended into the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins womb: if the body did descend into the virgins womb, then Christ took not flesh of the virgin. Thus that you may contradict me, you are not afraide ignorantly or wittinglye to deny the incarnation of our Sauiour: <q>
                     <hi>Theophilact</hi> saith well of these woords, when you read that the Sonne of man came downe from heauen, you may not think that his fleshe came downe from heauen, for this is the opinion of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,</q> which did teach that Christ brought his bodye from heauen, and did passe through the virgin, I hope you holde not this opinion, but if you holde this interpretation you must néeds fall into it, <hi>For he that descended, is euen the same that ascended.

               <p>But heere to let you alone with your Hebrew, these woords can no waies be taken as you beare vs in hand, for hell: but do purporte to vs the same that <hi>Iohn</hi> tolde vs in other woords, Ioh. 16. 18. <hi>I came from my Father into the worlde, againe I leaue the world and go to my father.</hi> For seeing the Apostle in this place bringeth his ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion as an argument of his descension, which <hi>Iohn</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelist did before: it must needs follow by necessarie consequence, that his discense was rather thither whence
<pb facs="tcp:4298:53"/>
he ascended. Now I trust you will not say he ascended into heauen from hell: but rather from the earth in the sight of his desciples. 2. If the place whence he descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded was heauen, hell could not be the place whether he descended. For if he were there at all, he went not thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 30. yeeres and more after he descended: if you will say, that he descended first into the earth and afterward into hell, then that descense could not be one motion, which was so many yeeres intermitted, but needes must be two. First from heauen into the earth, and next from the earth to hell. Lastly if hell were the place whither he descended, it must needes be also the place from whence he ascended, which cannot be: for his returning thence (if euer he was there) was when his soule retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into his body, he came again to his Disciples, from whom he was seperated before by death, which in the Scripture is called his resurrection, and not his ascenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For his resurrection (as it hath beene heertofore taught) is no part of his ascention. If it were so as you beare vs in hand. that thence his ascention beginneth, then his returning againe to his Disciples was but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding so farre in his way, and his abode with them but a resting place, which was neuer hard of to this day.</p>

Héerof I thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, Christ descended into the virgins wombe (as your selfe say) <hi>ergo</hi> he came not into the world. Or thus, Christ descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the worlde, <hi>ergo</hi> he descended not into the graue. Christ was borne of the virgin, and came into the world to reconcile vs to his Father by his death, taking away our sinnes, and triumphing in his owne person ouer death and hell, therefore not only Christ came downe into the worlde, but as our body for sinne lyeth in the graue, so his body we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into the graue: and because our soule was mancipate vnto hell, his soule went into hell, that by his discending our soules might be freed from hell.

Therefore as this is no good argument, Christ ascended from the mount <hi>ergo</hi> he ascended not from the graue, so this is also a weake argument, Christ ascended from the world, <hi>ergo</hi> he went not into hell: M. <hi>Humes</hi> lyeth in his bed and early ariseth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards many séeing him he rideth towards Bromham, <hi>ergo</hi> M. <hi>Humes</hi> came from <hi>Bath</hi> and not from his bed. Then you adde this reason, if Christ descended into hell, then it was 30. yéeres after his birth, and so it was not one moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: you charge me with cloudes of sophistry, but héere is a thick mist of sophisications: what you mean by this motion I know not, but all the actions of our Sauiour are aptly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into humility and glory: of his humilitye there are 4. degrées. First he came into the virgins womb, secondly into the world: thirdly to the graue: fourthly to hell. Of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and exaltation likewise there are foure degrées. First he came out of hell and the graue: secondly he conuersed in the
<pb facs="tcp:4298:54"/>
earth: thirdly he was carried in the aire in a cloud, and then entred the heauens with glory. Also where you say, that if hel were the place whether he descended, it must néeds be the place from whence he ascended. This as I haue said before is vtterly false, if you mean the immediate place from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he ascended, for it is known to all beléeuers, that Christ did descend into the graue, but he did not ascend immediatlye from the graue, therefore your reason is against Scripture, where you make a distinction betwéen the resurrection and the ascention: you may vnderstand if it please you, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Eph. 4. 9.</hi> The woord (ascend) containeth in it all the degrées of Christs exaltation, and therfore the resurrection also: as the woord descend doth comprehend all the degrées of Christs humilitye.</p>

               <p>Your next argument is taken from the wordes of our Sauiour to Mary Magdalen, Ioh. 20. 17. <hi>Touch me not, for I haue not yet ascended to my Father.</hi> Wherupon you ga ther, that seing the whole man is said to be there where the soule is, that Christs soule was not yet with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, seeing he doth say that he was not there himselfe.

That these words are ment of the whole, it is manifest by the text, for that which had not beene with the Father, was the same that Mary was forbidden to touch: That I trowe you will not say was his soule, but his soule and his body ioyned together, that is to say, the whole man Christ: wherefore it was the whole man that he saith here was not with his Father, and not his soule alone.</p>

               <p>My next place was not this, but a text out of <hi>Syrac. 17. 21. At the last shall he arise and reward them, and shall repay their reward vpon their heads, and shall turne them into the lower parts of the earth.</hi> In the margin is noted <hi>Math. 25. 35.</hi> So that this place sheweth that after iudgement, the wicked shalbe turned into the lower partes of the earth, that is, hell. This place, because you nor your Sinod can answere, you haue passed it ouer and said nothing to it, but are now come to your scholepoints, the which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I vse you call sophistry: and so it were indéede if I did vse them as you doo. You say an argument drawen negatiuely from the whole to the parts doth not hold. True it is if by (parts) you meane integrall parts, but not essentiall parts. My instance was this, <hi>Math. 8, 11. Many shall come from the East and the West, and shall rest with Abraham Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac and Iacob in the kingdome of heauen.</hi> Out of this place I proue that where the soule of man is after death, there is the man sayd to be, as we vsually say that these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes and all the saints are in heauen though their bodies be in the earth and are dust and ashes. If then the soule of Christ were in heauen vntill his resurrection, then could not these words of Christ be true <hi>Iohn. 20. 17. Touch me not, for I haue not yet ascended vnto my father,</hi> for it is the preterperfectense <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Therefore as this is vntrue to say that <hi>Abraham</hi> is not in heauen because his body is not in heauen: so this is false to say Christ was not in heauen, because his body was not in heauen. Our body is gouerned by the soule, and man taketh his appellation of a reasonable creature not of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body but of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule: and therfore if Christs soule went vp into heauen as you say, this can not be true (I haue not yet ascended to my father) Besides if Christs soule went first to heauen &amp; afterward his soule &amp; body together, then were there 2. ascensions: proue this, and I will geue

you the goale. You dally also with my argument in this manner. The whole race of mankinde is not in <hi>England, ergo</hi> there are no men in <hi>
                     <hi>England.</hi>
                  </hi> Do you thinke there is no more vnion betwixt Christ and his soule, then betwéene all the men of the world? then by this reason the body and soule of Christ were neuer vnited together. Your next re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance is this: <hi>Edmund Campions</hi> whole body is not ouer Newgate, <hi>Ergo</hi> no part of him. Héere is a foule error to thinke Christs soule to be an integrall or diuisible part, which is an essentiall or indiuisible: for by your reason Christs soule is mortall and may perish as the integrall partes of <hi>Campion</hi> doth. You vtter also in an other error in these words (the whole man Christ) for the whole man doth not make Christ, but God and man as you may sée in <hi>Athanasius</hi> Créede: <q>As the reasonable soule and flesh is one man, so God and man is one Christ.</q> I will ende there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with this saying of <hi>Irynaeus</hi> who liued vnder <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> in the yeare of our Lord God 125. which thus proueth the descending of Christ into hell. For he writing against Heretiques that sayd hell was in this world (as many doo now adayes) thus reproueth them in his fift booke and last Chapter. <q>As <hi>Ionas</hi> taried in the whales belly thrée dayes and thrée nights, so shall the Sonne of man be in the hart of the earth. And the Apostle saith, what is it that he ascended, but that he first descended into the lowest partes of the earth? and <hi>Dauid</hi> prophecying of this, sayd: Thou hast deliuered my soule from the nethermost hell: and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing againe the third day he sayd to <hi>Mary</hi> which he sawe first and worshipped him: Touch me not, for I haue not yet ascended to my Father, but go to my Desciples and tell them I will go to my Father and to your Father. If then the Lord kept the law of the dead that he might be the first begotten of the dead, how are they ashamed that saye hell is in this world.</q> Thus you sée it is no strange thing to sée this scripture alleaged to prooue that Christs soule was not in heauen vntill his visible and glorious ascention. <hi>Iri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>

               <p>Now let vs come to the great bulwarke of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence you choose to be your foundation and text. <hi>Peter</hi> sayth that <hi>Christ was put to death in the flesh and quickned in the spirit, by the which he went and preached to the spirits that are in prison which were in times past disobedient, &amp;c.</hi> Here following the <hi>Geneua</hi> translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I leaue some van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that the Greeke doth offer me, but I hope to finde heere matter enough to defende the truth. <hi>Beza</hi> heere (whome we also follow because he groweth neerest to the meaning of the Apostle) by this word spirit doth giue vs to vnderstand the deity of Christ, following <hi>Iohn</hi> that calleth God a spirit, <hi>Iohn. 4. 24.</hi> and by this word flesh his manhood conteining both his body and soule as he findeth the word vsed both of <hi>Paule, 1. Tim. 3. 16. God was manifested in the flesh,</hi> and also of <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe, <hi>1. Pet. 4. 1. Christ suffred for vs in the flesh.</hi> Which antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis of the deuine and humane nature <hi>Paule</hi> doth also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse in the same tearmes speaking of Christ, <hi>which was made of the seed of Dauid according to the flesh, and declared mightely to be the Sonne of God according to the spirit. Rom. 1. 3. 4.</hi> where you see he vseth the words no otherwise then he findeth them vsed in the scriptures. Now that this can not be the sence of them you reason thus. First you say that this participle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is, going doth signifye motion from some place which can not stand with the deuine Essence, which can not possibly leaue any place, being at all times in all places. To this I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that it is spoken of the same spirit or deuine es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in <hi>Gen. 18. 21. I will go downe and see whether the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4298:56"/>
                  <hi>do altogether according to the cry that is come vnto me.</hi> And in <hi>Exod. 3. 8. I am come downe to deliuer them,</hi> that is the <hi>Israelites,</hi> out of the hand of the <hi>Aegiptians.</hi> You can not be ignorant (<hi>M.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God declareth his presence in one place more then in another by some notable effect, which in this place was most necessary to expresse the continuall presence of Christ in his Church in those dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> and so in all ages either past or to come, departing as it were from all other places (which indeed he can not) and sitting as it were a perpetuall moderator and ruler thereof. Next you alleage the other participle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is quickned, that because it is passiue, it can not stand with the deuine essence which can not suffer. This we deny not, for we attribute not this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiple to the deuine essence, but to the whole Christ God &amp; man: for we say not Christ the spirit was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but Christ was quickned in spirit. Thirdly you tell vs that mortified and quickned were both participles, and both attributed to Christ at one time. We confesse they were attributed to one Christ, but we see no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to leade vs to refer them both to one time. But by the contrary (me thinks) that the order of the wordes haue sufficient matter in them to proue that he was first mortified and then quickned. As for the distinction of time, the distance was not to great as to require it. To this you adde how he was dead, and how he was aliue, by putting to killed flesh and to quickned spirit. The very text as I take it will deny you this, for it saith not that the flesh was killed and the spirit quickned, but that Christ was killed in the flesh and quickned in the spirit, which is all one, as if he had said that Christ dyed as he was man, and ouercame death as he was God. Which thing also <hi>Paule</hi> doth expresse in other words, <hi>2. Cor. 13, 4. He was crucified concerning his infirmitie, yet</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:4298:56"/>
                  <hi>liueth he through the power of God.</hi> Fourthly, you say that the scriptures do ioyn together this going &amp; preaching close to his passion, as if he had said, assone as he had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered he went &amp; preached. This (as if) concludeth no necessary matter. We expect demonstrations, &amp; cannot be caried with as, and if. Fiftly, you adde out of <hi>Gen. 6.</hi> that the preching of <hi>Noah</hi> is attributed to the 3. person, and not to the second, which putting on mans flesh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed vs. We confesse that ability to preach was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <hi>Noah</hi> by the holy ghoste, but he was stirred vp and sent by the whole Trinity. The actions whereof seeing they are common to all three, he erreth not that attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth them to any of the three. Where you saye that Christ was raised from the dead by the first person, and not by the second: I see not how that can stand with the truth of the Scriptures, which telleth me that the second person did put on man, and did neuer forsake him in all his distresses. Afterwards you tel me that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is disobedient, and sometime doo seperate the time of their disobedience and Christs going to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But I can not take it at your woord, for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is, not as you seeme to take it a Verbe but a Participle, gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is spirits in the verse before: and the Aduerb <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is, preached, so that the sence must needs be, he preached sometimes to the spirites that are in prison, and were disobedient in the dayes of <hi>Noah.</hi> Whereas you argue this can not be spoken of the preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> because he preached to men and to spirites: it is strange to me how he can preach to men and not to spirits, seeing that whosoeuer doth instruct men dooth also instruct their soules. Lastlye. you charge this construction to doo violence to the text, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the woord spirite for the diuinity in one place, and for the power thereof in another: where you doo vs great wrong, for <hi>Beza</hi> himselfe refuseth it, and proueth
<pb facs="tcp:4298:57"/>
it is not taken for the power of the deitye in this place at all. Hitherto haue I answered all that you can saye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, now will I proue that your sence which you make of this place, can not stand with the truth of the text. You take this woord (flesh) only for the bodye of Christ, which dyed and was buried: and the woord (spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite) for his soule, which you beare vs in hand descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into hell, preached to the soules which had beene rebellious in the dayes of <hi>Noah:</hi> if this your constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall goe for currant, then the apostle speaketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing heere of Christ, which may not be verified of any man. For though our bodyes dye, yet our soules liue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as his. The spirite here (as it appeereth by the text) doth signifie that which gaue life, to that which was dead: that I trust was not his soule, but his deity: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this participle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> killed, doth signifie not onelye the death of the bodye, but also whatsoeuer Christ did suffer either in body or soule for the redemption of our bodies and soules: and doth comprise his whole passion which the Spriptures doth many times terme death, which if it be so (as it is so indeed) then the woord flesh noteth vnto vs the whole subiect of his passion, that is, <hi>the whole man Christ,</hi> for it was expedient that he did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well<note place="margin">If this be true, then Christ was not dead as Peter saith.</note> suffer in soule for our soules, as in body for our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: or else he had been but halfe a redemer. Fourthly seeing his body was quickned, that is, restored from the graue aswell as his soule from the sorrowes of hell, if you take spirite there for the humane soule, then you confound those thinges which the Apostle doth distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, attributing that to the soule alone, which is also common to the body. Fiftly, seeing <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is to giue life, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to receiue life, this cannot be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the soule, which neuer lost life after that it had once liued with the body, and therefore could neuer receiue it againe. Here you tell vs that to be quickened is to be deliuered from miseries: how the English word
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4298:57"/>
may be taken I leaue it to the wise, but in the Greeke woord <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or the Latin word <hi>vi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ificari,</hi> I am sure it were strange and seldome seene to finde that sence. Furthermore, I am sure that if this deuise may stand, that then you will ouerthrowe the antithesis betweene <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap> dead and quickned, for if quickned doth not signifie a restitution to life, what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tithesis can it haue with death or dead. Lastlye, adde to those if it please you that infallible reason of <hi>Beza,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the scope and drifte of the Apostle, to whose greater notes I referre you, being not able to handle his reason so effectually as he dooth himselfe.</p>

and <hi>Crowley</hi> in his answere to the reasons of <hi>Pound</hi> the Papist. All these olde and new writers haue alleadged this Scripture as I haue doone with good warrant &amp; conscience. Now that I haue proued this my owne interpretation, I will (by Gods grace) proue your answere to be friuilous. First you confesse that killed and quickned are Participles of one tense, and yet you say they are not referred to Christ at one time, this is méerlye false, as I thus proue: Christ was after his passion dead and aliue, or neuer; if he were neuer<note place="margin">M. Humes disagreeth with Peter Paule and himselfe.</note> dead and aliue at one time, then <hi>Peter</hi> saith not truely, if he were dead and aliue at one time then you speak falsely. Now you your self co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed that he was dead and aliue at one time a little before, and proued it out of the <hi>2. Cor. 13. 4. He was crucified concerning his infirmity, yet liueth he by the power of God.</hi> Héere by your owne woordes Christ was aliue when he was crucified: so may I say with <hi>Peter,</hi> he was aliue when he was dead, and at one time, Then you say the (flesh) signifieth the manhoode, and (spirite) the deitye: this also is vntrue, for the body may be killed, but the soule cannot. Againe, shew me any Scripture where one and the same woord in one sentence and period, is taken for diuers things: for in this sentence, <hi>In which spirite he went and preached to the spirites that are in prison.</hi> Héere y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woord spirit in the beginning of the sentence signifieth the deity, in the latter ende the same woord signifieth the men that liued in <hi>Noahs</hi> time by your interpretation: but by my inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation it signifieth the soule seperat from the body in both places. For as <hi>Cirill</hi> saith, as Christ was with the liuing in body and soule, so to shew himselfe a true man, his bodye was among the dead bodies, and his soule among the soules. Then you auouch the preching of <hi>Noah</hi> is attributed to the whole Trinity, be it so, but can you proue that Christ after he was killed did preach in <hi>Noah,</hi> for this preaching was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christs death, which is mentioned in the 18. verse, and before his resurrection, which is spoken of in the 21. verse. You goe forward and tell me, that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> Now to answere your infallible reasons. First you reason against me, that if my construction be true, then nothing did happen to Christ which might not be verified of any man. And did you not blush when you wrote these things? <hi>Can any mans soule goe to hell, and returne againe?</hi> For his going downe to hell I proue in the 19. verse, and his returne from hell in the 21. verse. Seconly, you say the woord spirite doth signifie that which gaue life, what then? as God giueth life to the body effectually, so the soule giueth life to the body for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally. Your Geneua translation which you follow, saith, he was quickned in the spirite, not of the spirite. And this I note against your side <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the 18. verse you translate (In) But in the next verse as though you had not doone well in the former, you translate it (by) Now you know the preposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifieth (by) and not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as it appéereth in the 21. verse and in many places mo: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is, by the resurrection. Moreouer if you had said quickned of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then had you made a probable answere: but no diuine is able to proue this exposition, that Christ was quickned in the spirit, that is, in the deity, for the deity is life it selfe. Your third pregnant reason is, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifieth not only the death of the body, but also the whole passion of Christ. This cannot be, for the suffrings of Christ are set downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the same verse: then in this woord <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the manner of the death that Christ suffred, that is, he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4298:60"/>
was killed and suffred a violent death. For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deriued of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, must néeds signifie put to death. Now I hope you will not say Christ was put to death in soule and body, but in body only. And where you say that Christ suffered in soule aswell as in body, that is true, and that is gathered not of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is killed, but out of these words antecedent <hi>(for Christ suffered the iust for the vniust.)</hi> No reasonable man but he will say, that the sufferings of Christ are comprised rather in the word (suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered) then in the word (killed.) To your fourth reason I reply, that Christ was raysed from the dead, but it is spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially signifyed in the word resurrection, verse 21. and therefore I doo not confound those things that are distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, but your selfe: for you make suffered and killed all one, and quickned and the resurrection all one, and so make not only a confusion, but a fantology and néedelesse repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which neuer was read in the word of God. To your fift argument, where you say <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is to receaue life, I confesse it is to be made aliue. Then you vrge it can not be spoken of the soule which neuer lost life: Then by the same reason more strongly it can not be spoken of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, which hath, doth, and shall liue for euer: for God can not receaue life, but the soule is sayd to liue when he is out of the body, not because he liued not before, but because the body doth hinder the actions of the soule, <hi>Iohn. 11, 25. Hee that beleeueth in mee though he were dead yet shall he liue. Sap. 9, 15. The corruptible body is heauie vnto the soule, and the earthie mansion keepeth downe the minde that is full of cares. 2. Cor. 4, 16. Therefore wee faint not, but though our outward man perish, yet our inward man is dayly renewed.</hi> Héere <hi>Paule</hi> sayth, the weaker the body is, the stronger is the soule, therefore the death of the body is the life of the soule. To drawe to an ende, your Antithesis of the Deuinitie and humanitie is<note place="margin">Fortissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tum</note> answered before. For your Antithesis must be of things contrary or at the least diuers and separate, but as you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
<pb facs="tcp:4298:61"/>
truly the Godhead was neuer separated from the humanitie: therefore this antithesis is of the body and soule which at this time were deuided, and not betwéene the deity and humanitie which were alwayes vnited: wherefore this bulwarke I can assure you will stand, and you haue ouershot both it and your selfe in attempting to ouerthrowe it. For the very scope of the Apostle is this, All Christians must suffer afflictions for well doing, for Christ did not only suffer both in body and soule, but also was put to a shamefull death in his body, and in his soule went downe to the soules in hell, which were vnbeléeuers in the dayes of <hi>Noah:</hi> but Christ did arise againe from hell and the graue, and ascended both in body and soule to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: therefore shall you that suffer for well doing be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from death and hell by his merits, and goe vp into heauen, and be partakers of his glory as you haue bin partakers of his afflictions. Moreouer, as you referre me to reade <hi>Bezas</hi> great notes on this text, so I pray you to reade <hi>Aretius</hi> handling this place, whose wordes are these. <q>Generally (sayth <hi>Arctius) Peter</hi> repeateth thrée effects of Christs death if you marke it well. The first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the damned. The second to the elect. The third to the person of Christ. The first was declared in his des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending into hell. The second in his resurrection. The third in his ascention into heauen. This is the true and naturall meaning of this place which we will follow, leauing the intrications of other interpretations. I willinglie confesse this place is very hard, for <hi>Augustine</hi> doubteth of it, and <hi>Luther</hi> doubteth of it how it is to be vnderstoode, but this obscuritie ariseth not of the place, but of the varietie of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations. If thou marke the plainnesse of the place, the matter will be easye, but that pleaseth not all men: therefore that euery one may establish his owne sence, they apply the words of the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> to their owne conceit. But leauing these, let vs embrace that which the words do teach vs: in the which, if we attaine to the truth
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4298:61"/>
it is well, if not, yet they shall be probable, because they haue warrant out of the scripture, and leaue to the very letter <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, otherwise it is certaine the knowledge of man to be vnperfect in many questions of holie scripture, of the which the Apostle doth warne vs <hi>1. Corin. 15. For now we knowe vnperfectlie.</hi> I haue sayd héere is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thrée effects of Christs death which differ in time, and are set in order in the Créede. The first effect is, that Christ being dead, denounced eternall paines to the wicked in hell. The words of the Apostle are these. <hi>In which spirit hee went and preached to the spirits detained in prison.</hi> I take the place simply of the descence into hell, for so the words doo plainely sound, and I sée all the Fathers so to interprete them: sée <hi>Augustine Epist. 99.</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth manifestly interprete this place of the descending into Hell. Neither doth the word prison hinder this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which in the <hi>Apocal. 20. 5.</hi> is taken for hell. <hi>When a thousand yeeres shall be fulfilled, Satan shall be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed out of his prison.</hi> Therefore the prison that <hi>Peter</hi> héere speaketh of, is the place deputed to the damned. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came Christ, as we confesse in the Créede, he went downe into Hell. Where Hell is, it is a foolish and curious question to enquire, sith no man comming to that place euer returned but only Christ. Furthermore, what Christ did there, <hi>Peter</hi> expresseth, he preached to the spirits, that is, he declared that he shewed himselfe manifestly to the world, and made that dire and mournefull sermon namely to the wicked, that the merit of his death did nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto them, but by his presence were confirmed those punishments of the which <hi>Noah</hi> and other Prophets had forewarned them. And the tyme of this Preaching I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre not to the tymes of <hi>Noah,</hi> but to the tyme of hys descending into Hell. Whereunto agréeth the worde <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, spirits, for hée preached to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that is, to dead, and not to liuing men.</q> Thus farre <hi>Aretius.</hi> I could héere alleage many other newe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

whiche are of my iugement, but because you yéelde them no credite, therefore of purpose I will omit them.</p>

As for that new les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that he went thither to triumph, that is a base de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise to send him thither to triumph, who had conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hell on the crosse. For my owne part, I haue often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times read the name of hell ioyned with shame and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy, but to this day I neuer hard it <hi>ioyned with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph</hi>

Is it likely that he could tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph before the victory? You adde two other causes to binde the deuill and to deliuer vs from hell.

               <p>You aske me why Christ descended into hell, and yet you confesse I noted 3. ends of Christs descending into hell, the one to triumph ouer the Diuels: the other to binde the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, and to take away their power ouer mankinde: the 3. to deliuer vs from hell. There was also set downe a fourth end, that is, to manifest his death vnto those in hell &amp; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue them of their incredulity: and héere labouring to catch me in a snare, you are fallen into it your selfe: for firste you say Christ conquered hell on the crosse, then as hauing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten<note place="margin">Humes is contrarye to himself.</note> your selfe you aske this question with admiration. How could he conquere being in the graue? Is it likely that he would triumph before the victory?

                  </hi> Next you saye you haue not read the name of hell, but ioyned with shame and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: why doo you write then that the <hi>Godhead did tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph ouer hell?</hi> Did you not read your owne writing, I am sure in this place. <hi>1. Cor. 15. 55. O death where is thy sting? O hell where is thy victory?</hi> The name of hell is ioyned with triumph, but you answere these places with a flat negatiue. Héere is not a sillable to proue the descending of Christ into hell. I am sure <hi>Paule</hi> proueth héere the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Christ and of our selues, and how can he proue the resurrection, vnlesse he proue the knitting together of the body and soule? for as death is the parting of body and soule, so resurrection is the reuniting of them together againe, and héere <hi>Paule</hi> sheweth that the body comming out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graue and the soule from hell, Christ did conquere both. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not the deity as you say, but the humane nature of Christ did vanquish death and Hel. <hi>Heb. 2. 14. For as much then as the children were partakers of fleshe and bloud, he also himselfe likewise tooke parte with them, that he might destroye through death him that had power of</hi>

                  <q>Therefore <hi>Hemingius</hi> on the <hi>Col. 2.</hi> saith.

Christ came out of the graue, <hi>ergo</hi> he conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red death, and Christ came out of hell, <hi>ergo</hi> he ouercame hel. Therefore thus I reason against you, that did conquere which did fight, but the humane nature of Christ did fight,<note place="margin">Humes disagreeth with Peter and Paule, 1. Pet. 3. 22.

               <p>Now one thing remained wherin you seemed to run beyond your selfe, and most men doo wonder what you meant thereby, whereas Christ vpon the Crosse did vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the hearers then, and to all ages after, that he had finished the woork of our redemption in these woords, It is finished: you take on you to proue that he meant not so, alleadging these places. Ioh. 17. 4. <hi>I haue finished the woorke which thou gauest me.</hi> Act. 13. 29, <hi>And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him.</hi> Ioh. 19 28. <hi>Seeing all things were finished that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.</hi> Out of al these places say you it may be seen that there remained somewhat to doo. Good M. Hill remember your selfe and you shall finde no man of our side that will deny you so much. When our Sauiour cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out It is finished, he had not yet giuen vp the ghoste, which was the ende of his woorke: but I trust you will graunt vs this, that the meaning was this woorke there should be at ende, when he had breathed his last breath
<pb facs="tcp:4298:64"/>
for you know it is a common manner to speake that in the time past, which is meant presentlye to come. So Christ himselfe speaketh in another place. <hi>Beholde the time commeth, and it is already come, that you shall be scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> You brought vs here a distinction of <hi>Consummatum re,</hi> and <hi>Consummatum spe,</hi> out of the Dunces.

He that will holde that must needs condemne truth it self for an vntruth: for if he had but onely passed the death of the body, they which feele hell, and we also should know that he had scarsely yet beene fleabitten, in respect of that which is to come.

               <p>Héere you haue spoken much and proued nothing, for of those reasons which I haue laide down in my Sermon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this point, not one is answered. Onely as you tolde me before I was immodest, so now you tell me I am a mad man, and the wonder of the worlde. I must answere you with <hi>Dauid, I am become as a monster vnto many, but my trust is in thy law.</hi> But what will men iudge of you, that in one and the same matter affirme and deny. You con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse in the beginning, that there remained somewhat to doo,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4298:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and in the end you wonder at me because I sayd all things were not finished in the crosse. Your next words are these, when our Sauior cryed it is finished, he had not geuen vp the ghost which was the end of his worke. It is true that after the speaking of <hi>Consummatum est,</hi> it is finished, he gaue vp the ghost, but that was not the finishing of his worke, for he must also shead his bloud. <hi>Heb. 9. 22. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sheading of blood there is no forgeuenes of sins. 1. Pet. 1. 19. Iohn. 1. 7. Apoc. 1. 5.</hi> In all which scriptures it is set downe, that we are redéemed with the precious bloud of Christ. The bloud of Christ doth purge vs from all sinne: he hath loued vs, and washt away our sinnes in his bloud. Therefore the geuing vp of the ghost was not the end of his worke. Héere is a fault committed by you, but I will not woonder at you, nor say you are runn besides your selfe, but you runn against your selfe, and resist also the holy ghost. Then you scornefully reiect my destinition of <hi>Consummatum re,</hi> and <hi>Consummatum spe,</hi> that is, finished in hope, and finished in déede. I will defende it, for it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not out of the Dunces, but out of Gods sacred word. <hi>Rom. 8. 24.</hi> it is sayd, <hi>We are saued by hope. Gal. 5. 5. for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousnes through faith. Luc. 21. 24. Lift vp your heads</hi> (sayth Christ to his Disciples) <hi>for your redemption draweth nigh. Rom. 8. 23. And not only the creature but we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so which haue the first fruites of the spirit do sigh, euen we do sigh in our selues waiting for the adoption, euen the redemption of our bodyes. Musculus</hi> on the fourth Chapter of the <hi>Ephesians</hi> thus writeth, the places are these, That we are called in hope not in déede, and that the hope of future blessings is the stay of our faith as long as we are in this flesh, for we are saued <hi>nondum in re sed in spe,</hi> not yet in déede but in hope. By all these scriptures it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that our consummation is in hope and not in déede (as <hi>Musculus</hi> noteth) neither shall be actually perfited vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the day of iudgement. Therefore I did with this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
<pb facs="tcp:4298:65"/>
refute the argument which is made of those that are on your side, who thus conclude. Christ sayd on the crosse It is finished, <hi>Ergo</hi> he went not downe to hell. By the same reason I thus argue. Christ said on the crosse It is finished, <hi>Ergo</hi> he did not shead his bloud, nor was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, nor rose againe, nor ascended into heauen to fulfill all things. <hi>Ephes. 4. 10.</hi> for if all things were then fulfilled on the crosse, what néede he to ascende to fulfill all things. Therefore I did proue that this argument of yours did make no more against the descending into hell, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the sheading of his bloud, buriall, resurrection, ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or iudgement, all which are necessary to our weale and perfect consummation. Farther, to proue my distinction to be true, I did then quote that as Christ is sayd to be the Lamb slaine from the beginning of the world, so the death of Christ did reach to the first beléeuers, and shall doo to the last. Which consummation by hope is so enioyed as if we possessed it already: <hi>for all the promises of Christ are yee yee and amen, 2. Cor. 1. 20.</hi> Therefore I told you this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument It is finished, <hi>ergo</hi> Christ went not downe to hell was a fallary <hi>
                     <hi>a dicto secundum quid ad simpliciter.</hi>
                  </hi> Also I noted how these words were to be vnderstood. First, that all the scriptures and prophecies were fulfilled, for so the text noteth. Secondly, it is finished doth signifye, there is no other sacrifice for sinne: <hi>for by one sacrifice once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, he hath made perfect all that shall be sanctified, Hebr. <hi>10, 14.</hi>
                  </hi> And therefore the Papists ioyning the merits of Saints with the merits of Christ, doo erre most shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Thirdly it was finished as concerning all his labors and sorrowes. Fourthly all his suffrings both of body and soule were ended, which he finished on the crosse. Briefely his obedience to his Father was ended, for he yéelded a pure, perfect, and perpetuall obedience to his Father, and therefore had all power giuen him in heauen earth and hell. Moreouer I did proue this interpretation by this text, <hi>1. Cor. 15. 54. Then shall be brought to passe the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:4298:65"/>

Last of all, you séeme to charge me as though I had said that Christ went downe to suffer, which thing I neuer mentioned, but that he went downe to manifest his death, to triumph in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son ouer the Diuell, and personally to redéeme vs from hell. Then you call them dunces whence I had that distinction. I had it from <hi>Musculus,</hi> and <hi>Musculus</hi> from the word of God, and therefore you must embrace these distinctions, or else you will speake erroneously. <hi>

               <p>Truth it is, I did preach at <hi>Leicocke,</hi> and because I heard that M. <hi>Wisdome</hi> had set that opinion of yours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broche againe at <hi>Cosham,</hi> I did here also confirme mine. Not because I am desirous to be contentious, but because I would haue no Christian man to doubt of the articles of his Faith, you aske me what comfortable or necessarye matter you déeme, that we doo preach? I answere: and I pray you consider of it, we are borne in sinne: how are we deliuered from sinne, but by Christ, which was conceiued by the holy Ghoste: we haue the magnitude of sinnes with <hi>Peter,</hi> the multitude of sinnes with <hi>Mary Magdalen:</hi> the turpitude of sinnes with the woman taken in adultery, the infamy of sinnes with the Publican: the diuturnity of sinnes with the théefe on the gallowes: the cruelty of sinnes with <hi>Paule,</hi> and the recidiuation into sinnes with diuers of the Sainies: yet if we repent we are pardoned for Christs sake, who purely, perfectly, and perpetually obeyed the law of God. By reason of our sinnes we are subiect to all punishments, both corporall and spirituall, and to the wrath of God: All these punishments due to vs, did Christ suffer vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crosse, both in body and soule, and therefore it is called his Passion. He suffered in the Garden, in <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas</hi> house, in <hi>Pilats</hi> hall, but vpon the crosse as you say truely he suffered the agonies of death and torments of hell. Further by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of sinne this was laide vpon our first Parentes, Thou shalt dye the death: so by reason of this sentence not onelye the body was condemned to death, but the soule to damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To deliuer vs from these two punishments, the soule of Christ went to hell and returned, and the body of Christ that lay dead in the graue rose againe mightily, naturallye, spéedily and happely. Besides Christ arose in déede, he gaue himselfe to be felte and handled, hereupon we are assured that he conquered death and hell. He ascended into Heauen
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4298:67"/>
and therefore our praiers are hard, when we pray vnto him and he giueth vs gifts for our ministery, and so he shal come to iudgement at the last day to giue vs perfect blessednes. You confesse that Christ was borne in déed, liued and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the law in the likenes of our flesh (sinne excepted) he dyed in déede, he was buried indéed, he arose and ascended indéede, and yet you will not confesse that he personallye descended. How can all these articles going before and comming after be vnderstoode of the person of Christ, and of his humanity, and not this. Therefore you denying this personall descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Christ into hell, take away the great comfort of our deliuerance from hell. You say we are deliuered from hell by Christs death: so are we too by his birth. For if Christ had not bene borne he had not dyed: so if there had not béene a seperation of the bodye and soule of Christ, he could neuer haue conquered death or hell for by descending into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graue, and that personally, he conquered death, and hath deliuered vs from death, and by going downe into hell personallye, he hath conquered hell. And for this cause the Scripture appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to the death of Christ, because death was (as <hi>Paule</hi> saith, <hi>Phil. 3. A dissolution of body and soule,</hi> and these 2. partes being dissolued, Christ came from the graue and from hell, and so Christ did conquere both, and triumph ouer them in him selfe, as it is <hi>Col. 2. 15.</hi> These Iewes doo aske a signe from heauen, <hi>Math. 22, 38. Luke. 11. 29.</hi> to whom Christ said, <hi>A wicked &amp; aduoulterous Generation doth aske a signe, but no signe shalbe giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the signe of <hi>Ionas</hi> the Prophet, for as <hi>Ionas</hi> was in the whales belly three dayes and three nights: so shall the sonne of man be in the hart of the earth, three daies and three nights.</hi> Which woords <hi>Basilius Magnus</hi> interpreteth very well. These woords (a signe) is a matter made manifest contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the declaration of some thing that was hidden, as the signe of <hi>Ionas</hi> representeth the descending of Christ into hel, and the resurrection of Christ, and as <hi>Bede</hi> saith and <hi>Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi> also, he gaue them a signe but not from heauen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

they were vnworthy to see it but from the deapth of hell.. Therfore (M. <hi>Humes</hi>) this is a most comfortable doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine that Christ doth deliuer vs from hell, which albeit you agnise aswell as we, yet because you deny the meane where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it was purchased, you deny a most comfortable doctrine: for not only the body of Christ was in the hart of the earth, but the Sonne of man, which signifieth the whole humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is, the soule and the body. <hi>Ionas</hi> was in the whales belly aliue and yet came forth, Christ was in the graue dead in flesh, and aliue in hell and yet came forth. Therefore to take away this maner of descending, taketh away from the Church a singuler comfort, and openeth a gapp to many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors confuted already by the Fathers. For if Christ did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere hell by the power of the Godhead only and not as he is man, what néed had he to take vpon him our nature? but because as man he might be Lord not of heauen and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, but of the earth and the inhabitants therofand of hell and the diuells. You say the worlde is sory for me. <hi>In the worlde</hi> saith Christ <hi>you shall haue affliction. And he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth me the world will hate me.</hi> I way not these thinges, for I am no man-pleaser, nor louer of the worlde. But if in my Sermon I had disagréed with <hi>Dauid, Ezechiel, Esay, Peter, Paule,</hi> and Christ himselfe as you haue done in your answere, I hope I should be both sory and ashamed. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching M. <hi>Chalfoult</hi> whom you terme a man without iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that he spake impudently and enuiously, I neuer saw him before that time and but ouce since, but by that spéech and conference which I had with him I finde him to be learned and voide of gall. Such of his neighbours as I haue talked with, did giue him the deserued praise of a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and honest man. And forasmuch as he hath preached sound doctrine in preaching the affirmatiue, and that doctrin which is allowed by the learned conuocation of this land, it doth not become you to libell against him, for in speaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him you traduce all those reuerend and learued men, which made an Iniunction for kéeping of vnitie, that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  </hi> As you reuile at M. <hi>Chalfoult,</hi> so doo you and your freends pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily against me, calling me a Bishoppling and a timeseruer. Indéed I was brought vp vnder Bishop <hi>Iewell,</hi> who cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chised me in this faith, &amp; therfore I will not easily or rashly departe from it. I confesse my selfe also to be a timeseruer, <hi>for it is the day &amp; time of saluation accepted.</hi> Let them murmure with <hi>Martin</hi> that list, I praye God my dayes may end with this time, and my time may continue no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then these daies of the state of our Church that now is do continue. I haue séene the beginning, I haue séene the propagation of the Gospell, I haue séene God hath defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our Church mercifully and miraculously from heauen, God graunt that I and all my Auditors may walk worthy of our calling, Godly, iustly, and soberly. Therefore I end with this saying of S. <hi>Paule 1. Cor. 4. 3. As touching me I passe very little to be iudged of you, or of mans iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And in the 5. verse, <hi>Therefore iudge nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time vntill the Lord come, who shall lighten things that are hidden in darkenes, and make the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of the hart manifest, and then shall euery man haue praise of God.</hi>

               <p>M. <hi>Humes</hi> in the latter end of your answere you request me to recant: if your answere did please me as it doth you, I would be as willing to recant as you and your fréendes would be glad to heare it. But I will plainely set down my reasons why I do not recant: The first is: I alleadged
<pb facs="tcp:4298:69"/>
                  <hi>Act. 2.</hi> and proued out of <hi>Peters</hi> sermon my assertion, and to the reasons I drew out of that place you haue answered nothing. Secondly I alleadged <hi>Syrach 17. 21.</hi> To proue that this phrase the nethermost partes of the earth doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie hell, to this you haue in like manner saide nothing. Thirdly in all your answeres to my allegations, you haue disagréeed with the word of God. In answering of the 16. Psalme, you say my allegation is to be vnderstoode of the passion of Christ: And <hi>Peter Act. 2.</hi> saith it is spoken of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> resurrection, whether is to be beléeued of <hi>Peter</hi> or you, I referre it to the indifferent Reader. Then I proued that <hi>Erets tacthioth</hi> that is, the nethermost partes of the earth did signifie hell, out of 63. Psalme and 9. verse: In answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this you dissent from <hi>Dauid</hi> and M. <hi>Caluin.</hi> Now whether it be more safe to foliow <hi>Dauid</hi> or you, let my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies iudge. I alleadged <hi>Ezechiel</hi> to proue that point also 31. Chapter, 5. 16, 17, 18, 19. In answering to that place you haue gainsaide <hi>Ezechiel, Esay</hi> in his 14. chapter. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaterus, Munster,</hi> and <hi>Pellicane.</hi> Now whether it be more fit for me to beléeue you or <hi>Esay,</hi> or <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> let your owne fauourites iudge. Then I alleadged the knowne place of <hi>Peter,</hi> you trauailed much about this place, yet in your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of this woord <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is spirites, which you interprete the soules of the men that liued in <hi>Noahs</hi> time, you contradict the woords of our Sauiour <hi>Luk. 24. 39. For Christ saith a spirit hath not flesh and bones as you see me haue.</hi> And yet you and your Masters say that this word spirit may signifie a man liuing. Now whether it be more expedient for me to beléeue you or Christ, I referre it to your owne iudgement. You said my Sermon at <hi>Chip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penham</hi> did confirme you and your fréends, but I hope your owne answeres will not confute me but your selfe, and cause your selfe and them both to recant. You say you séeke to know the truth, so do I, as knoweth the knower of al harts wherfore whether you or I haue taught the truth, let not

Humes nor <hi>Hill</hi> iudge, but the learned of the vniuersities. For as <hi>Paule</hi> saith, <hi>1. Cor, 14. 32. Yhe spirits of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, are subiect to the Prophets.</hi> That is, the labours of learned men are to be iudged of the learned. <hi>The God of patience and consolation giue vs grace that we may be like minded one towards another according to Christ Iesus, that we may with one minde &amp; with one mouth, glorifie God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ.
