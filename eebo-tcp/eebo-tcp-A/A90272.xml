         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He enſuing Sermon was preached upon as

as at the deſire of very many who

Being come abroad, it was in my thoughts to have
directed it immediately in the firſt place to Her, who of
any <hi>individuall perſon</hi> was moſt neerely concerned in
Him. But having obſerved how neere ſhe hath been to
be ſwallowed up of ſorrow, and what ſlow progreſſe, <hi>he</hi>
who tooke care to ſeale up inſtruction to her ſoule
by all diſpenſations, hath given her hitherto toward a
conqueſt thereof: I was not willing to offer directly a
new occaſion unto the multitude of her perplexed
thoughts about this thing. No doubt, her loſſe being as
great as it could be upon the account of one ſubject to the
law of mortality, as many grains of grief and ſorrow are
to be allowed her in the balance of the Sanctuary, as God
<pb facs="tcp:166049:3"/>
doth permit to be laid out and diſpended about any of the
ſons of men. He who is able to make ſweet the bittereſt,
waters, &amp; to give a gracious iſſue to the moſt grievous tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
will certainly, in due time, eminently bring forth that
good upon her ſpirit, which he is cauſing all theſe things
to work together for. In the mean time, Sir, theſe lines
are to you: Your neer relation to that rare example of
Righteouſneſs, Faith, Holineſs, Zeal, Courage, Self-denial,
Love to his Countrey, Wiſdom and Induſtry, mentioned
in the enſuing Sermon, the mutuall tender affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
you whileſt he was living; your preſence with him
in his laſt triall and conflict, the deſerved regard you bear
to his worth and memory; your deſigne of looking into,
and following after his ſteps and purpoſe in the work of
God in his Generation, as ſuch an accompliſhed patern,
as few ages have produced the like; with many other
reaſons of the like nature, did eaſily induce me hereunto.
That which is here printed is but the notes I firſt took,
not having had leiſure ſince to give them a ſerious peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall,
and upon that account, muſt beg a candid interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto any thing that may appear not ſo well digeſted
therein as might be expected. I have not any thing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
concerning your ſelf, but only my deſire's that your
heart may be <hi>fixed to the Lord God of your fathers,</hi> and
that in the middeſt of all your Temptations and Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
wherewith your pilgrimage will be attended, you
may be carried on and eſtabliſhed in your inward ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
unto, and outward contending for the Kingdome of
the dearly beloved of our ſouls; not fainting, or waxing
weary until you receive your diſmiſſion to reſt, for your lot

            </list>
            <p>1 The perſon diſmiſſed is <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Writer of this prophecie,
who received all the <hi>great viſions of God</hi> mentioned therein, and I
deſire to obſerve concerning him as to our purpoſe in hand, two
things.</p>
            <p>1 His <hi>Qualifications.</hi> Secondly, his <hi>Employment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, I ſhall only name ſome of them that were moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
in him, and they are three.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Wiſdome. 2 Love to his people. 3 Uprightneſſe and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
in the diſcharge of that high place whereunto he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the firſt, the holy Ghoſt beareth ample Teſtimony there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,</hi>
Dan. 1. 17, 20. As for theſe foure children, God gave them know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and skill in all learning and wiſdome, and <hi>Daniel</hi> had underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in all viſions and dreams.</p>
            <p>And in all matters of wiſdome, and underſtanding that the King
enquired of them, he found them ten times better then all the Magicians
and Aſtrologers that were in all his Realm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In all matters of wiſdom, and underſtanding none in the whole Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian
Empire</hi> full of Wiſe-men and Artiſts, were to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto <hi>Daniel</hi> and his companions, and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> 28. 3. rebuking
the pride and arrogancie of <hi>Tyrus</hi> with a bitter ſcorn, he ſayes;
<hi>Behold, Thou art wiſer than Daniel,</hi> or thou thinkeſt thy ſelf ſo, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating
that none in <hi>wiſdom</hi> was to be compared unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:166049:4"/>
2 <hi>Love to his people.</hi> On this account was his moſt diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into the time of their deliverance, and his earneſt contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with God upon the diſcovery of the ſeaſon, when it was to be
accompliſhed, <hi>Cha.</hi> 9. 1, 2, 3, 4. Hence he is reckoned amongſt them,
who in their generation ſtood in the gap, in the behalf of others,
<hi>Noah, Daniel and Job.</hi> Hence God calls the people of the Jews, <hi>his
people, Ch. 9. 24 Seventy weeks are determined on thy people:</hi> the people
of thy Affections and deſires, the people of whom thou art, and
who are ſo dear unto thee,</p>
            <p>3 For his <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> in diſcharging of his Truſt and Office,
you have the joynt teſtimony of God and Man: his high place
and preferment you have; <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 2. he was the firſt of the three
Preſidents who were ſet over the hundred &amp; twenty other Princes
of the Provinces; &amp; the Holy Ghoſt tels you that in the diſcharge of
this high Truſt and great Employment, he was faithfull to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
<hi>Verſe 4. Then the Preſidents and Princes ſought to finde occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
againſt</hi> Daniel <hi>concerning the Kingdome, but they could finde
none occaſion nor fault: foraſmuch as he</hi> was <hi>faithfull, neither was
there any errour or fault found in him.</hi> Which alſo his enemies
confeſt, <hi>Verſe</hi> 3. Then ſaid theſe men, we ſhall not find any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
againſt this <hi>Daniel,</hi> except we finde it againſt him concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Law of his God.</p>
            <p>Theſe qualifications I ſay amongſt others were moſt eminent in
this perſon, who here received his diſmiſſion from his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is his <hi>Employment it ſelf,</hi> from which he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed,
and herein I ſhall only obſerve theſe two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 The nature of the Employment it ſelf.</item>
               <item>2 Some conſiderable Circumſtances of it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For the firſt, it conſiſted in receiving from God, and holding
out to others cleer and expreſſe Viſions concerning Gods won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
<hi>providentiall Alterations</hi> in Kingdoms, and Nations, which
were to be accompliſhed, from the dayes wherein he lived, to the
end of the World. All the Prophets together had not ſo many
cleer diſcoveries, as this one <hi>Daniel</hi> concerning theſe things.</p>
            <p>2 For the latter, this is obſervable, that all his <hi>Viſions</hi> ſtill cloſe
with ſome eminent Exaltation of the <hi>Kingdome of Chriſt;</hi> that is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:166049:5"/>
the centre where all the lines of his Viſions do meet, as is to be
ſeen in the cloſe almoſt of every Chapter, and this was the great
intendment of the Spirit in all thoſe glorious revelations unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
to manifeſt the ſubſerviency of all civill revolutions unto the
intereſt of the Kingdom of the Lord Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This then is the <hi>perſon</hi> concerning whom theſe words were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and this was <hi>his Employment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 There is <hi>his diſmiſſion</hi> it ſelf, <hi>Go thou thy wayes,</hi> Now this may be
conſidered two wayes,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 <hi>Singly,</hi> relating to his <hi>Employment</hi> only.</item>

            </list>
            <p>In the firſt ſence, the Lord diſchargeth <hi>Daniel</hi> from his further
attendance on him, in this way of receiving <hi>viſions</hi> and Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning things that were ſhortly to come to paſſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
happily his portion might yet be continued in the Land
of the living: As if the Lord ſhould ſay. Thou art an inquiring
man, thou art ſtill ſeeking for further aquaintance with my minde
in theſe things, but content thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt receive no more
Viſions; I will now imploy <hi>Haggai, Zechariah,</hi> and others, <hi>thou</hi>
ſhalt receive no more, but I cannot cloſe with this ſenſe, for;</p>
            <p>1 This is not the manner of God to lay aſide thoſe whom he
hath found faithfull in his ſervice, <hi>men indeed do ſo,</hi> but God chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
nat: whom he hath begun to honour with any employment,
he continueth them in it, whileſt they are faithfull to him.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Daniel</hi> was now above an 100 yeares old, as may be eaſily
demonſtrated by comparing the time of his captivity, which was
in the third yeare of the Reigne of <hi>Jehojakim, Chap.</hi> 1. 1. with the
time of his writing this prophecy, which is expreſly ſaid to be in
the reigne of <hi>Cyrus the King of Perſia, Chap.</hi> 10. 1. and therefore
probably his end was very nigh; and after this you heare of him
no more; who had he lived many dayes, it had been his ſin, not
to have gone up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the decree of <hi>Cyrus</hi> giving liberty
for a returne being paſſed.</p>
            <p>It is not then Gods laying him aſide from his Office ſimply,
but alſo his intimation that he muſt ſhortly lay down his morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and ſo come into the condition wherein he was <hi>to reſt</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the end; This then is his <hi>diſmiſſion,</hi> he died in his work, life
and employment go together, <hi>Go thou thy wayes.</hi>

Obſ. 1. <hi>There is an appointed ſeaſon wherein the Saints of the moſt
eminent Abilities, in the moſt uſefull employment, muſt receive their
diſmiſſion,</hi> be <hi>their work</hi> of never ſo great importance, be their
<hi>Abilities</hi> never ſo choice and eminent, they muſt in their ſeaſon
receive their diſmiſſion.</p>
            <p>Before I handle this Propoſition, or proceed to open the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words, I ſhall crave leave to bring the <hi>work</hi> of God, and
the vvord of God, a little cloſe together, and lay the parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveen
the perſons diſmiſſed, the one in our Text, the other in a
preſent providence, vvhich is very neare, only that the one lived
not out halfe the dayes of the other.</p>
            <p>Three perſonall qualifications we obſerved in <hi>Daniel,</hi> all
which were very eminent in the perſon of our deſires.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Wiſdome.</hi> There is a <hi>manifold wiſdome,</hi> which God imparteth
to the ſons of men; there is <hi>ſpirituall wiſdome,</hi> that by the way of
eminency is ſaid to be <hi>from above, Jam.</hi> 3. 17. which is nothing but
the gracious Acquaintance of the ſoule with the hidden wiſdome
of God in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. and there is a civill wiſdome, or a
ſound ability of minde for the management of the affairs of men
in ſubordination to the Providence, and Righteouſneſſe of God.
Though <hi>both theſe</hi> were in <hi>Daniel,</hi> yet it is in reſpect of the latter
that his wiſdome is ſo peculiarly extolled. And though I am very
farre from aſſuming to my ſelf the skill of judging of the Abilities
of men, and would be farre from holding forth things of meere
common report, yet, upon aſſured grounds I ſuppoſe this gift of
God, <hi>Ability of minde,</hi> and dextrous induſtry for the management
of humane Affairs may be aſcribed to our departed friend.</p>
            <p>There are ſundry things that diſtinguiſh this wiſdom from that
policie which God abhors, which is <hi>carnall, ſenſuall and devilliſh,
Jam.</hi> 3. 15. though it be the great darling of the men of the world;
I ſhall name one or two of them.</p>
            <p>1 A gracious diſcerning of the minde of God, according to his
appearance in the Affairs wherein men are employed, <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 9.
the Lords voice cryeth unto the City, the man of wiſdom ſhall ſee
thy name, heare the rod, and who hath appointed it. It is the
<hi>wiſdom of a man,</hi> to ſee the name of God, to be acquainted with his
<hi>will,</hi> his minde, his <hi>aime</hi> in things, when his <hi>providentiall voice crieth
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:166049:6"/>
to the City.</hi> All the works of God have their voice, have their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:
thoſe of ſignal providences ſpeak aloud, they cry to the
City; Here is the <hi>wiſdome of a man,</hi> he is <hi>a man of ſubſtance,</hi> a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
man, that can ſee his name in ſuch diſpenſations. <hi>This carnall
policie</hi> enquires not into, but is wholly ſwallowed up in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation
of things among themſelves, applying ſecondary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
unto events, without once looking to the <hi>Name</hi> of God, like
Swine following Acorns under the tree, not at all looking up
to the tree from whence they fall.</p>
            <p>2 Such acquaintance with the ſeaſons of Providence, as to know
the duty of the people of God in them, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 32. the children
of <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> men that had underſtanding of the times, to know
what <hi>Iſrael</hi> ought to do: this it is indeed to be <hi>a man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi>
to know in any ſeaſon the duty of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they may
walke up to Acceptation with God in the performance thereof. A
thing which is neither preſcribed in the Rules, nor followed in the
practiſe of men, wiſe only with that curſed politie which God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors:
to have a minde ſuited unto all ſeaſons and tempers, ſo as
to compaſſe their own ſelfiſh ends, is the utmoſt of their aime.</p>
            <p>Now in both theſe did this gift of God ſhine in this deceaſed
Saint.</p>
            <p>1 He ever counted it <hi>his wiſdom</hi> to look after the name of God,
and the teſtification of his will, in every diſpenſation of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
wherein he was called to ſerve: for <hi>this</hi> were his wakings,
watchings, enquiries; when that was made out, he counted not
his buſineſſe half done, but even accompliſhed, and that the iſſue
was ready at the doore; not what ſaith this man, or what ſaith
that man, but what ſaith the Lord? that being evident; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
not with fleſh and bloud, and the wiſdom of it, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
perhaps, would he have leaned to it, he was as little deſtitute
as any in his <hi>Generation,</hi> I mean the whole wiſdom of a man.) The
<hi>Name</hi> of God was as land in every ſtorm, in the diſcovery where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
he had as happy an eye at the greateſt ſeeming diſtance when
the clouds were blackeſt, and the waves higheſt, as any.</p>
            <p>2 Neither did he reſt here: what <hi>Iſrael ought to do,</hi> in every ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
was alſo his enquiry; ſome men have a wiſdome to know
things, but not ſeaſons in any meaſure; ſurely a thing in ſeaſon, is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:166049:6"/>
no leſſe beautifull then a word in ſeaſon: <hi>as apples of gold in pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of ſilver:</hi> there are few things which belong to civill affairs,
but are alterable upon the incomprehenſible variety of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.
Theſe alter and change the very nature of them, and
make them good or bad, that is uſeful or deſtructive. He that will
have the garment that was made for him one yeer, ſerve him and
fit him the next, muſt be ſure that he neither increaſe nor vvane.
Importune inſiſting on the moſt uſefull things, without reſpect to
alterations of ſeaſons, is a ſad ſigne of a narrovv heart. He of
vvhom vve ſpeak, vvas vviſe to <hi>diſcern the ſeaſons,</hi> and performed
things, vvhen both themſelves, and the vvayes of carrying them
on vvere excellently ſuited unto all coincidences of their ſeaſon.
And indeed, vvhat is <hi>moſt wiſely</hi> propoſed in one ſeaſon, may be
moſt fooliſhly purſued in another. It had been vviſdom in <hi>Joſhua</hi>
not to have made any compact, but to have ſlain all the <hi>Gibeonites;</hi>
but it vvas a folly ſorely revenged in <hi>Saul,</hi> vvho attempted to do
the ſame. He vvho thinks the moſt righteous and ſutable propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals
or principles, that ever vvere in the vvorld (ſetting aſide ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
rules of unchangeable Righteouſneſſe, and Equity compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
all times, places, wayes and forms of Government) muſt be
perform'd as deſirable, becauſe once they were ſo, is certainly a
ſtranger to the Affairs of humane kinde.</p>
            <p>Some things are univerſally unchangeable and indiſpenſable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
mem, ſuppoſing them to live anſwerable to the generall
principles of their kinde: as that a Government muſt be, without
which, every one is the enemy of every one; and all tend to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
deſtruction, which are appointed of God for mutuall preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that in Government ſome do rule, and ſome be in ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that all rule be for the good of them that are ruled, and the
like principles that flow neceſſarily from the very nature of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
ſociety.</p>
            <p>Some things again are alterable &amp; diſpenſable, meerly upon the
account of preſerving the former principles, or the like: if any of
them are out of courſe, it is a <hi>vacuum</hi> in nature politick, for which
all particular elements inſtantly diſlodge and tranſpoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to ſupply, and ſuch are all forms of Government amongſt
men, which if either they ſo degenerate of themſelves that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:166049:7"/>
directly oppoſite, or are ſo ſhattered by providential Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
as to become uſeleſſe to their proper end, may and ought
to be changed, and not upon other accounts: but now for other
things in Government, as the particular way, whereby perſons
ſhall be deſigned unto it, the continuance of the ſame perſons in
it, for a leſſe or a greater proportion of time, the exerciſe of more
or leſſe power by ſome ſorts, or the whole body of them that are
ruled, the uniting of men for ſome particular ends by bonds &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements,
and the like occaſional emergencies, the univerſal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
of them is roll'd on prudence to act according to preſent
circumſtances.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Love to his people:</hi> This was the ſecond <hi>qualification,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Daniel</hi> was ſo eminent. And our deceaſed friend, not to enter
into compariſon with them that went before, had cleerly ſuch a
proportion, as we may heartily deſire that thoſe who follow after,
may drink but <hi>equall</hi> draughts of the ſame cup; that as his pains,
labour, travel, <hi>Jeopards</hi> of his life, and all that was dear to him, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhment
of <hi>Relations</hi> and contentments, had ſweetneſſe and
life from this motive, even <hi>intenſeneſſe of Affection to his people,</hi> the
people of whom he was, and whoſe proſperity he did deſire, needs
no further demonſtration, then the great neglect of ſelf and all
ſelf-concernments which dwelt upon him, in all his tremendous
undertakings: <hi>vicit amor patriae,</hi> or certainly he who had upon
his breſt and all his undertakings <hi>ſelf-contempt</hi> ſo eminently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven,
could not have perſiſted wreſtling with ſo many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to the end of his dayes: It was <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thereof, which was preferr'd to his chief joy. Neither</p>
            <p>3 Did he come ſhort in <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> in the adminiſtration of
that high place whereto he was called? nay, then this, there was
not a more eminent ſtone in that <hi>Diademe</hi> which he had in the
earth. If he lay not at the bottom, yet at leaſt he had a ſignall
concurrence in ſuch Acts of Juſtice, as Antiquity hath not known,
and Poſterity will admire. Neither was it this or that particular
act that did in this beſpeak his praiſe, but a conſtant will and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of rendring to every one his due.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not inſiſt upon particulars, in theſe and ſundry other
perſonall Qualifications, between the perſons mentioned a Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
may lie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:166049:7"/>
2 As to Employment, that of <hi>Daniel</hi> was mentioned before: it
was the receiving, and holding out from <hi>God, Viſions</hi> of ſignal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntiall
Alterations, diſpoſing and tranſpoſing of States, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Kingdoms, and Dominions; what he had in <hi>Speculation,</hi>
was this <hi>mans</hi> part to follow in Action, he was an eminent inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the hand of God in as tremendous Providentiall Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as ſuch a ſpot of the World hath at any time received ſince
<hi>Daniel,</hi> foreſaw in generall them all: and this, not as many have
been carried along with the ſtream, or led by outward motives,
and conſiderations far above their own principles and deſires, but
ſeeingly and knowingly, he cloſed with the minde of God, with
full purpoſe of heart, <hi>to ſerve the will of the Lord in his Generation.</hi>
And on this account did he ſee every <hi>mountain made a plain before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> and ſtaggered not at the greateſt
difficulties, <hi>through unbelief, but being ſtedfaſt in faith, he gave glory
to God.</hi> And to compleat the Parallel, as <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Viſions were ſtill
terminated in the Kingdom of Chriſt; ſo all his actions had the
ſame aime and intendment. This was that which gave life, and
ſweetneſſe to all the moſt diſmall and black engagements that at
anytime he was called out unto. All made way to the comming in
of the promiſed glory. It was all the <hi>vengeance of the Lord and his
Temple.</hi> A <hi>Davidicall</hi> preparation of his paths in bloud, that he
might for ever reign in Righteouſneſſe and Peace; but be he ſo
or ſo, the truth of our Propoſition is confirmed towards him.</p>
            <p>There is an appointed ſeaſon when the Saints of the moſt eminent abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
in the moſt uſefull Employments ſhall receive their diſmiſſion,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>I ſhall briefly open the reſt of the words, and ſo take up the
propoſition again, which vvas firſt laid dovvn.</p>
            <p>2 Then, there is the term allotted to him in this ſtate of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<hi>untill the end be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three things may be here intended in this vvord <hi>end, untill the
end be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>The end of his life, Go thou thy wayes to the end of thy life,</hi> and
dayes; but this we before diſallowed, not conſenting that <hi>Daniel</hi>
received a diſmiſſion from his Employment, before the end of his
life and pilgrimage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:166049:8"/>
2 <hi>The end of the World, Go thy wayes to the end of the World:</hi> till
then thou ſhalt reſt in thy grave; but neither yet doth this ſeem
to be peculiarly intended in theſe vvords. The vvords in the <hi>cloſe
of the text</hi> do expreſly mention that, calling it the <hi>end of the dayes;</hi>
and in ſo fevv vvords, the ſame thing is not needleſly repeated:
beſides, had this expreſſion held out the vvhole time of his abode
in the ſtate of reſt here ſignified, it muſt have been, <hi>Go thou thy
wayes, for thou ſhalt reſt untill the end be;</hi> So that,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>end</hi> here is to be accommodated unto the things,
whereof the Holy Ghoſt is peculiarly dealing with <hi>Daniel;</hi> and
that is the Accompliſhment of the great Viſions which he
had received, in breaking the Kingdomes of the World, and
ſetting up the Kingdome of <hi>the holy One of God: Daniel</hi> is
diſmiſſed from further attendance in this ſervice, he ſhall not
ſee the actuall Accompliſhment of the things mentioned, but
is diſmiſſed and laid, aſide unto the end of them. The vvord, <hi>untill,</hi>
in the Scripture is not ſuch a limitation of time, as to aſſert the
contrary to vvhat is excepted, upon its accompliſhment: <hi>untill the
end,</hi> doth not ſignifie, that he ſhould not reſt after the end of the
things intimated, no more then it is affirmed that <hi>Michal</hi> had chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
after her death, becauſe it is ſaid, that <hi>untill</hi> her death, ſhe had
none, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 23. this then is that end that he is diſmiſſed unto;
<hi>the appointed ſeaſon for the accompliſhment of thoſe glorious things
which he had</hi> foreſhovvn.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> God oftentimes ſuffers not his choiceſt ſervants to ſee the iſſue
and accompliſhment of theſe glorious things wherein themſelves have been
moſt eminently engaged.</p>
            <p>3 The third thing (that vve may make haſte) is his ſtate and
condition, during the time vvhich he lies under this diſmiſſion, in
theſe vvords, <hi>for thou ſhalt reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing of difficulty in theſe vvords, but vvhat vvill
naturally fall under conſideration in the opening of the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which they hold out; which is</p>
            <p>Obſ. 3. <hi>The condition of a diſmiſſed Saint is a condition of Reſt,
Thou ſhalt reſt untill the end be.</hi> What this reſt is, and from what,
with wherein it conſiſts, ſhall be afterwards explained.</p>
            <p>4 The laſt thing in the <hi>Text</hi> is; the utmoſt iſſue of all theſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:166049:8"/>
diſpenſations, both as to his <hi>fore-going labour,</hi> and his <hi>preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi>
and <hi>following Reſt. Thou ſhalt ſtand in thy lot, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are two things conſiderable in theſe words, <hi>The ſeaſon of
the accompliſhment of what is here foretold, and promiſed unto Daniel,</hi>
and that is <hi>in the end of the dayes,</hi> that is, when time ſhall be no
no more, when a period ſhall be put to the dayes of the World:
called the <hi>laſt day,</hi> the <hi>great day,</hi> the <hi>day of Judgement;</hi> that is the
ſeaſon of the accompliſhment of this promiſe, <hi>the day wherein God
will judge the world, by the man whom he hath ordained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> There is an appointed determinate ſeaſon, wherein all things
and perſons according to the will of God will run into their utmoſt iſſue
and everlaſting condition.</p>
            <p>2 The thing foretold, and promiſed, that is, <hi>that he ſhould ſtand
in his lot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> There is an appointed lot for every one to ſtand in, and meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
portion, which in the end they ſhall receive.</p>
            <p>2 There is an eminent lot hereafter, for men of eminent employment
for God here.</p>
            <p>I ſhal not be able to handle all theſe ſeveral Truths which lie in
the words; thoſe only which are of moſt <hi>Importance</hi> and moſt <hi>ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi>
may briefly be handled unto you, and the firſt is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is an appointed ſeaſon wherein</hi> the Saints of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
abilities, in the moſt uſefull Employments muſt receive their
diſmiſſion, <hi>Zach. 1. 5. Your Fathers where are they? and the Prophets do
they live for ever?</hi> Fathers, and Prophets have but their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and they are not: They have their diſmiſſion; ſo old <hi>Simeon</hi>
profeſſeth, <hi>Nunc Dimittis, Luke</hi> 2. 29. Now thou giveſt me a <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion:</hi>
they are placed of God in their ſtation, as a Centinel in
his Watch-tower, and they have their appointed ſeaſon, and are
then diſmiſſed from their Watch. The great Captain of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
comes, and ſaith, <hi>Go thou thy wayes,</hi> thou haſt faithfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
thy duty; go now unto thy reſt. Some have harder ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
ſome have harderduty then others: ſome keep guard in
the Winter, a time of ſtorms and temptations, trials and great
preſſures: others in the ſun-ſhine, the <hi>Summer</hi> of a more flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eſtate and condition; yet duty they all do; all attend in the
ſervice; all endure ſome hardſhip, and have their appointed ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:166049:9"/>
for their diſmiſſion: And be they never ſo <hi>excellent</hi> at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
of their duty, they ſhall not abide one moment beyond
the bounds which <hi>He</hi> hath ſet them, who ſaith to all his creatures,
<hi>thus far ſhall you go and no further.</hi> Oftentimes this diſmiſſion is in
the midſt of their work, for which they ſeem to be moſt eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
qualified.</p>
            <p>The three moſt eminent works of God, in and about his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
in dayes of old, were 1 His giving his people the Law,
and ſetling them in the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> 2 His recovering them
from the <hi>Babyloniſh Captivity,</hi> and 3 His promulgation of the
Goſpel unto them. In theſe three <hi>works,</hi> he employed three moſt
eminent perſons; <hi>Moſes.</hi> in the firſt; <hi>Daniel</hi> in the ſecond, and
<hi>John Baptiſt</hi> in the third, and neither of them ſaw the work ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed,
wherein they were ſo eminently employed: <hi>Moſes
died</hi> the yeer before the people entred <hi>Canaan: Daniel,</hi> ſome few
yeers before the foundation of the Temple: and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> in the
firſt yeer of the Baptiſme of our Saviour, when the Goſpel which
he began to preach, was to be publiſhed in its beauty and glory.
They had all but their appointed ſeaſons, though their abilities
were eminent: who like unto them, and their employment excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
what like it in the earth? yet at their ſeaſons, they muſt go
their ways <hi>to reſt,</hi> and lie down, <hi>till they ſtand in their lot at the end of
the dayes.</hi>

               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. The generall condition of their mortality doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
that it ſhould be ſo: <hi>It is appointed to all men once to die, Heb.</hi> 9.
27. There is a ſtable law fixed concerning the ſons of men, that is
not upon the account of any uſefulneſs here to be diſpenſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<hi>The number of our moneths are with God; he hath fixed our bounds,
which we ſhall not paſſe:</hi> our dayes are as the dayes of an hireling,
that have a certain prefixed and determinate end: their ſtrength
is not the ſtrength of ſtones, neither is their fleſh of braſſe, that
they ſhould endure for ever. See <hi>Job</hi> 14, 10, 11, 12. This (I ſay) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
that there ſhould be an <hi>appointed ſeaſon for their Employment,</hi>
for it is ſo for their lives: and yet there is more in it then this: for
in the courſe of 5000 yeeres, God hath exempted two perſons by
his Sovereignty from the <hi>condition of mortality,</hi> who walked with
him in their generations. So that the <hi>bounds fixed</hi> to them were
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:166049:9"/>
not upon the account of their <hi>lives,</hi> but meerly of the <hi>work</hi> they
had in hand.</p>
            <p>2 God doth it, that he may be the more <hi>eminently ſeen</hi> in the
carrying on his own works, which in <hi>their ſeaſon</hi> he commits to
them. Should he leave his work always on one hand it would ſeem
at length to be the work of the Inſtrument only. Though the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<hi>oppoſed Moſes</hi> at the firſt, yet it is thought they would have
worſhipped him at the laſt: and therefore God buried him where
his body could not be found. Yet indeed he had but the lot of
moſt, who faithfully ſerve God in their generations: <hi>deſpiſed</hi>
whileſt they are preſent, idolized when they are gone. I do not
know of any great work, that the Lord carried out the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to be the beginners and enders of. He gave them all their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
that his power and wiſdome might the more evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in carrying it from one hand to another.</p>
            <p>3 God makes <hi>room</hi> as it were in his <hi>Vineyard,</hi> for the budding,
flouriſhing and fruit-bearing of other Plants which he hath plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Great Employments call for great exerciſe of graces. Even
in Employments in and about providentiall things, there is the
exerciſe of ſpirituall grace: as much Faith and Prayer, as much
communion with God, walking before him and wreſtling with
him, may be uſed in caſting down of <hi>Armies,</hi> as in ſetting up of
<hi>Churches:</hi> God exerciſeth all the graces of <hi>his,</hi> in the work he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
them out unto. He principles them, by faith and fellowſhip
with himſelf, for their Employment; and <hi>therefore He</hi> gives each
individuall, but his appointed ſeaſon, that others in whoſe hearts
he hath lodged the ſame ſpirit wherewith they are endued, may
come forth, and ſhew the fruits thereof. <hi>Daniel</hi> lieth down in the
duſt, in reſt and peace, and why ſo? the ſpirit of prophecie is pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out on <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Ze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

work, and beare my name before my people. Conſider the uſe

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. of Exhortation unto all that are imployed in the
work of God, eſpecially ſuch as with <hi>eminent Abilities</hi> are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in eminent <hi>Employments,</hi> you have but your alotted ſeaſon for
your work: your <hi>day</hi> hath its <hi>cloſe,</hi> its evening: your <hi>night</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:166049:10"/>
wherein none can work: <hi>The grave cannot praiſe the Lord, death
cannot celebrate him, it's the living, the living that are fitted for that
worke, Iſa.</hi> 38. 18, 19. It is true, men may alot you your ſeaſon,
and all in vain, but your <hi>Times are in the hand of God;</hi> that which
he hath appointed out unto you ſhall ſtand; be you never ſo <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,</hi>
never ſo <hi>uſefull,</hi> yet the dayes of your ſervice <hi>are as the
dayes of an hireling,</hi> that will expire at the appointed ſeaſon: be
wiſe then to improve the time that is in your hands; this is the
praiſe of a man, the onely praiſe whereof in this world he is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker,
that <hi>he doth the will of God, before he fall aſleep:</hi> that he faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſerves his generation, untill he be no more.</p>
            <p>For a dying man to wreſtle with the <hi>rebukes</hi> of God, and the
<hi>complaints</hi> of his own conſcience, for meeting with the <hi>end</hi> of his
<hi>dayes,</hi> before he hath attained the <hi>midſt</hi> of his <hi>duty,</hi> is a ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>You have your <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> and you have <hi>but</hi> your ſeaſon, neither
can you lye down in peace, untill you have ſome perſwaſion that
your <hi>worke</hi> as well as your <hi>life</hi> is at an end; what ever then you
finde to do, do it with all your ſtrength, for there is neither wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
nor power in the grave whither you are going, <hi>Eccleſiaſt.</hi>
9. 10.</p>
            <p>Some particular Rules may direct you herein.</p>
            <p>1 Compare yonr ſelves with the Saints of God, who were
faithfull in their generations, and are now fallen aſleep; What a
deal of work did <hi>Joſiah</hi> do in a ſhort ſeaſon? what a Light did <hi>John</hi>
ſet up in a few yeares? with what unwearied paines and induſtry
did our deceaſed friend ſerve his generation? It is ſaid of <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
that he was aſhamed of his own ſloth, when he found that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
had conquered the Eaſtern world, at the age wherein he
had done nothing. Behold here, one receiving his diſmiſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the age of 40 <hi>yeares,</hi> and what a world of work for God,
and the Intereſt of the Lord Chriſt did he in that ſeaſon? and
how well in the cloſe, hath he parted with a <hi>temporall life</hi> for him,
who by his death procured for him an eternall life, And now
Reſt is ſweet unto this labouring man. Provoke one another by
examples.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:166049:10"/>
2 Be diligent <hi>to paſſe through your work,</hi> &amp; let it not too long hang
upon your hands: Your appointed ſeaſon may come before you
bring it to the cloſe; yea ſearch out work for God. You that are
intruſted in power, trifle not away your ſeaſon. Is there no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
perſon that with diligence you might relieve? is there
no poor diſtreſſed Widow or Orphane, whoſe righteous <hi>Requeſts</hi>
you might expedite and diſpatch? are there no ſtout offenders
againſt God and man that might be chaſtized? are there no ſlack
and ſlow Counties and Cities in the execution of Juſtice, that
might be quickened by your example? No places deſtitute of the
Goſpel that might be furniſhed and ſupplyed by your induſtry and
wiſdome? can you not finde out ſomething of theſe or the like
nature to be diſpatched with vigour and diligence? nay do not
innumerable particulars in each kinde lye upon your hands? And
is not your performance of them ſuch a ſacrifice as wherewith
God is not well pleaſed? your time is limited and appointed,
you know not how ſoon you may be overtaken with it; and
would it not be deſireable unto you, that you had done theſe
things? will it be bitterneſſe in the end, that you ſo laid out your
endevours?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. All men <hi>have but their ſeaſons in any worke,</hi> onely God
abideth in it for ever: in every undertaking let your eye ſtill be on
him, with whom is the fulneſſe and the reſidue of the ſpirit. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah's</hi>
great bewailing of <hi>Joſiah's</hi> death was doubtleſſe made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of his diſcerning that none would come after him
to carry on the worke which he had begun, but the wickedneſſe
of that people was come to their height: elſe God can raiſe up
yet more <hi>Joſiahs:</hi> let him be eyed as the principall and onely abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Agent in any great undertaking.</p>
            <p>In the reſidue of the obſervations I ſhall be very brief. The
next is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2 God oftentimes ſuffers not the choiceſt of his ſervants to
ſee the accompliſhment of thoſe glorious things wherein themſelves have
been moſt eminently engaged.</p>
            <p>The caſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> is moſt eminently known, he had a large
ſhare in ſuffering the perſecutions which were allotted to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:166049:11"/>
40 yeers baniſhment he endured in the Wilderneſſe, under
the reproach of Chriſt 40 yeers more ſpent in wreſtling with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
difficulties, dangerous perils, mutinies, wars and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.
At the cloſe when he comes to look upon the Laud,
when the end of all that diſpenſation was to be wound up, and
the Reſt and Reward of all his toile and labour to be had, which
formerly he had undergone for tvvice 40 yeers; <hi>Go thou thy wayes,
ſaith the Lord, thou ſhalt reſt,</hi> take thy diſmiſſion, thou ſhalt not
enter into the good Land, lie down here in the Wilderneſſe in
peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> goes and preaches <hi>the drawning nigh of the kingdom of
God,</hi> but lived only to point out Chriſt with his finger, cryes; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Lambe of God,</hi> I muſt decreaſe, and is cut off. <hi>David</hi> makes
the great preparation for the Temple, but he ſhal not ſee ſo much
as the foundation laid. Men muſt take their appointed lot. <hi>God
will ſend by the hand of him whom he will ſend.</hi> Daniel <hi>muſt reſt untill
the end be.</hi> It is ſaid of ſome they began to deliver <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The caſe
of <hi>Zerobbabel</hi> was very rare, who ſaw the foundation, and alſo
the top-ſtone of the Temple laid, and yet the work of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
was not halfe finiſhed in his dayes, as you may ſee, <hi>Zach. chap.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. God oftentimes receives ſecret provocations from
the choiceſt of his ſervants, which moves him to take them ſhort
of their deſires. Thoſe of his own whom he employes <hi>in great
workes,</hi> have great and <hi>cloſe communion</hi> with him. God uſually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
their ſpirits in neer acts of fellowſhip with himſelf: <hi>they
receive much from him,</hi> and are conſtrained <hi>to unburthen themſelves
frequently upon him;</hi> now when men are brought into an intimacy
with God, and have received great engagements from him, the
Lord takes notice of every working and acting of their ſoules
in an eſpeciall manner, and is oftentimes grieved and provoked
with that in them which others can take no notice of: let a man
read the ſtory of that action of <hi>Moſes,</hi> upon which the Lord told
him directly he ſhould not ſee the <hi>finiſhing</hi> of the work he had
in hand, nor enter into <hi>Canaan, Numb.</hi> 20. 7, 8, 11. It will be a hard
matter, to finde out wherein the failing was: he ſmote the Rock
with the rod, with ſome words of impatience, when he ſhould one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:166049:11"/>
have ſpoken to it, and this with ſome ſecret unbelief, as to the
thing he had in hand: God deales with others viſibly, according
to their outward Actions, but in his own he takes notice of all
their unbelief, fears, withdrawings, as proceeeding from a frame
in no meaſure anſwering thoſe gracious diſcoveries of himſelfe,
which he hath made unto them, and on this account it is, that
ſome are taken off in the midſt of their work.</p>
            <p>2 To manifeſt that he hath better things in ſtore for his Saints
then the <hi>beſt and utmoſt</hi> of what they can deſire or ayme at here
below. He had a heaven for <hi>Moſes,</hi> and therefore might in love
and mercy deny him <hi>Canaan.</hi> He employeth ſome <hi>eminently,</hi> their
<hi>work</hi> is great, their <hi>end</hi> glorious, at the very laſt ſtep almoſt of
their journey, he takes off one and another, lets them not ſee the
things aymed at: <hi>this</hi> may be thought hard meaſure, ſtrict ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
exact juſtice, yea as <hi>Job</hi> complains, <hi>taking advantages againſt
them;</hi> ſee but what <hi>he calls them to,</hi> in calling them off from their
greateſt Glories and Excellencies on the earth, and all this will
appear to be love, tenderneſſe and favour in the higheſt. Whileſt
you are labouring for a handfull of <hi>firſt fruits,</hi> he gives you the
full harveſt; Whileſt you are labouring for the <hi>figure</hi> here below,
he gives you the ſubſtance above. Should you ſee the <hi>greateſt
worke,</hi> wherein any of you were ever ingaged, brought to <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
yet all were but as a few drops compared with that fulneſſe
which he hath prepared for you. The Lord then doth it to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to the children of men, that the things which are ſeen the
beſt of them, are not to be compared with the things that are not
ſeen, yea the leaſt of them, in as much as he takes them whom he
will honour, from the very doore of the one, to bear them into
the other. The meaneſt enjoyment in heaven is to be preferred
before the richeſt on earth, even then when the Kingdome of
Chriſt ſhall come in moſt beauty and glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. You that are ingaged in the work of God, ſeeke for a
reward of your ſervice in the ſervice it ſelfe. Few of you may
live to ſee that beauty &amp; glory which perhaps you aime at as the
end of all your great undertakings for God, whereinto you have
been engaged. God will proceed his own pace, and calls on us to
go along with him, and in the mean time, untill the determinate
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:166049:12"/>
end come, to wait in faith, and not make haſte. Thoſe whoſe
mindes are ſo fixed on, and ſwallowed up with <hi>ſome End (though
good)</hi> which they have propoſed to themſelves, do ſeldome ſee
good dayes, and ſerene in their own ſoules, they have bitterneſſe,
wrath and trouble all their dayes: are ſtill preſſing to the <hi>end</hi>
propoſed, and commonly are diſmiſſed from their ſtation before
it be attained. There is a ſweetneſſe, there is a wages to be found
in the work of God it ſelfe: men who have learned to hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God in every work he calls them out unto, though
they never ſee the maine harveſt they aime at in generall, yet ſuch
will reſt ſatisfied and ſubmit to the Lords limitation of their time:
they bear their owue ſheaves in their boſomes. Seeing God often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
diſmiſſes his choiſeſt ſervants, before they ſee, or taſte of
the maine fruits of their endeavours; I ſee not upon what account
conſolation can be had in following the Lord in <hi>difficult diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
but only in that reward which every duty bringeth along
with it, by Communion with God in its performance. Make then
this your aime, that in ſincerity of heart, you do the work of God
in your generation: finde his <hi>preſence</hi> with you, his <hi>Spirit</hi> gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
you, his <hi>Love</hi> accepting you, in the Lord Chriſt, and when
ever you receive your diſmiſſion, it will be <hi>Reſt</hi> and peace, in
the meane time, you will not make haſte.</p>
            <p>2 See a bottome and ground of Conſolation, when ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Inſtruments as this departed worthy, are called off from <hi>their
ſtation</hi> when ready to enter upon the harveſt of all their labours,
watchings, toylings, and expence of bloud, God hath better
things for them in ſtore, <hi>abiding things,</hi> that they ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
for a day or two, which is the beſt of what they could hope
for here, had they lived to ſee al their deſires acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed; but ſuch
as in the fulneſſe whereof, they may lie downe in peace to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Why do we complaine? for our ovvne loſſe? is not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue,
and fulneſſe of the Spirit vvith him, vvho gave him his
diſmiſſion? for his loſſe, he lived not to ſee <hi>Ireland</hi> in peace, but
enjoyes the glory of that eternall Kingdome that vvas prepared
for him before the foundation of the World, vvhich is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
held out in the third obſervation.</p>
            <p>Obſ. <hi>The condition of a diſmiſſed Saint is a condition of Reſt, Go
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:166049:12"/>
thy way, untill the end be; for thou ſhalt reſt.</hi> The Apoſtle gives it in
as the iſſue of a diſcourſe from a paſſage in the Pſalmes, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth,
<hi>Therefore a reſt unto the people of God, Heb.</hi> 4. 9. it remains,
and is reſerved for them, this the Lord hath ſolemnly proclaimed
from Heaven, <hi>Revel. 14. 13. Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord,
from henceforth, yea, ſaith the Spirit, that they may reſt from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and their works do follow them:</hi> they go into a bleſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of reſt; There is not any notion under which the State of a
diſmiſſed Saint, is ſo frequently deſcribed as this, <hi>of Reſt,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is the proper end and tendency of all things; their <hi>happineſſe
is their reſt;</hi> their reſt is all the happineſſe they can be partakers of:
<hi>Feciſti nos ad te Domine, &amp; inquietum eſt cor noſtrum, donec veniat
ad te.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Reſt</hi> holds out two things unto us, 1 <hi>A freedom from</hi>
what is oppoſite thereunto, wherein thoſe that are at reſt, have
been exerciſed, in reference whereunto they are ſaid to be at reſt.
2 Some thing which ſuites them, and ſatisfies their nature in the
condition wherein they are; and therefore they are at <hi>reſt,</hi> which
they could not be, were it not ſo with them, for nothing can <hi>reſt,</hi>
but in the full fruition, and enjoyment of that which ſatiates
the whole nature of it in all its extent and capacity. We muſt then
briefly inquire, 1 what it is that the Saints are at reſt from, and
ſecondly, what it is that they are at reſt in, which I ſhall do very
ſpeedily.</p>
            <p>1 The many particulars which they are at reſt from, may be
referred unto two general heads, 1 Sin. 2 Labour, and travel.</p>
            <p>1 Sin; this on all conſideration, whatever, is the main diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the ſoule; Temptations to it, Actings in it, troubles for it,
they are the very Egypt of the ſoule, it's houſe and place of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and vexation; either the <hi>power of it indwelling,</hi> or the <hi>guilt of
it preſſing,</hi> are here ſtill diſquieting the ſoule. For the firſt, how
doth <hi>Paul</hi> complain, lament, yea cry out concerning it, <hi>Rom. 7. 24.
O wretched man that I am!</hi> and what a ſad, reſtleſſe, and tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
condition upon this account doth he deſcribe in the Verſes
foregoing? The <hi>beſt,</hi> the <hi>wiſeſt,</hi> the <hi>holieſt</hi> of the Saints, on this
account are in a reſtleſſe condition.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a man <hi>a conquerour</hi> in every battel, in every combate
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:166049:13"/>
that he is engaged in, yet vvhileſt he hath any fighting, though
he be never foiled, yet he hath not peace. Though the Saints
ſhould have ſucceſſe in every engagement againſt ſin, yet becauſe
it vvill ſtill be rebelling, ſtill be fighting, it vvill diſturbe their
peace.</p>
            <p>2 So alſo doth the <hi>guilt</hi> of it; our Saviour teſtifieth, that a
ſenſe of it wil make a man to <hi>be weary and heavy-laden, Mat.</hi> 11. 28.
This oftentimes makes <hi>the Inhabitants of Sion, ſay they are ſick,</hi> for
though an <hi>end</hi> be made of ſin as to the guilt of it in the bloud of
Chriſt, yet by reaſon of our darkneſſe, folly, and unbeliefe, and
the <hi>hiding of the countenance of God,</hi> the conſcience is oftentimes
preſſed with it, no leſſe then if it lay indeed under the whole
vveight and burthen of it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not inſtance in more particulars, concerning this cauſe of
want of reſt, and diſquietneſſe, the perplexity of Temptations,
<hi>buffettings &amp; winnowings of Satan,</hi> Allurements and Affrightments
of the World, darkneſſe and ſorrows of unbeliefe, and the like
do all ſet in againſt us upon this account.</p>
            <p>This in general is the firſt thing, that the diſmiſſed Saints are
at reſt from: They, <hi>ſin no more,</hi> they <hi>wound</hi> the Lord Jeſus no more,
they <hi>trouble</hi> their own ſouls no more, they <hi>grieve</hi> the Spirit no
more, they <hi>diſhonour</hi> the Goſpel no more, they are troubled no more
with Satans Temptations without, no more with their own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
within, but lie down in a conſtant enjoyment of one ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
victory over ſin, with all its Attendants: <hi>ſaith the Spirit,
They reſt from their labours, Revel.</hi> 14. thoſe labours which make
them faint, and vveary, their contending with ſin to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt;
they are no more cold in communion, they have not one
thought that wanders off from God to Eternity: they loſe him
no more, but alwayes lie down in his boſome vvithout the <hi>leaſt
poſſibility</hi> of diſturbance. Even the very Remembrance of ſin is
ſvveet unto them, when they ſee God infinitely exalted, and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired</hi>
in the pardon thereof.</p>
            <p>They are free from trouble, and that both as to doing, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering:
fevv of the Saints, but are called out in one kinde or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to both theſe. Every one is either <hi>doing</hi> for God, or ſuffering
<hi>for God,</hi> ſome both do and ſuffer great things for him: in either of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:166049:13"/>
them there is pain, vvearineſſe, travel, labour, trouble, ſorrovv-and
anxiety of ſpirit; neither is there any eminent <hi>doing</hi> or vvork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for God, but is carried on vvith much <hi>ſuffering</hi> to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard
man.</p>
            <p>What a life of labour and trouble did our deceaſed friend lead
for many yeers in the fleſh? hovv vvere his dayes conſumed in
travel? God calling him to his foot, and exerciſing him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the ſvveetneſſe of that promiſe, that they that die in
him, <hi>ſhall have reſt:</hi> many ſpend their dayes deliciouſly, vvith ſo
much contentment to the fleſh, that it is impoſſible they ſhould
have any foretaſte and ſvveet relliſh of their <hi>Reſt</hi> that is to come.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tels us that there <hi>remains a Reſt for the people of God;</hi>
and yet vvithall, that they vvho <hi>believe are entred into that Reſt,</hi>
thoſe vvho in their labours, in their Travels do take in the ſvveet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of that promiſe <hi>of Reſt,</hi> do even in their labour make an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
thereinto.</p>
            <p>This then ſecondly, they reſt from all trouble and anxiety that
attend them in their pilgrimage, either in doing or ſuffering for
God. <hi>Heb. 4. 10, 7. They enter into reſt, and ceaſe from their work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
God wipes all tears from their eyes, there is no more <hi>watching,</hi>
no more <hi>faſting,</hi> no more <hi>wreſtling,</hi> no more <hi>fighting,</hi>
no more <hi>bloud,</hi> no more <hi>ſorrow,</hi> the ranſomed of the Lord
do return vvith everlaſting joy on their heads, and ſorrovv
&amp; ſighing flyavvay. There Tyrants pretend no more title to their
Kingdom; Rebels lie not in vvait for their bloud; they are no
more awakened by the ſound of the Trumpet, nor the noiſe of the
Inſtruments of death: They feare not for their relations, they
weep not for their friends, <hi>the Lambe is their Temple, and God is all
in all unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 This will not compleat their <hi>Reſt,</hi> ſomething further is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
thereto: even ſomething to ſatisfie, everlaſtingly content
and fill them in the ſtate and condition wherein they are. Free
them in your thoughts from what you pleaſe, without this, they
are not at <hi>reſt.</hi> This then you have in the ſecond place, <hi>God is the
reſt of their ſoules, Pſal.</hi> 116. returne to thy reſt, O my ſou. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed
Saints reſt in the boſome of God, becauſe in the fruition
and enjoyment of him they are everlaſtingly ſatisfied, as having
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:166049:14"/>
attained the utmoſt end whereto they were created, all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe
whereof they are capable. I could almoſt beg for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
a little to expatiate in this meditation of the ſweet, gracious,
glorious, ſatisfied condition, of a diſmiſſed Saint.</p>
            <p>But the time is ſpent, and therefore without holding out one
drop of water to quench the feigned fire of Purgatory, or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth any thing to diſcover the vanity of their Aſſertion,
who affirme the ſoul to ſleep, or to be nothing untill the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
or their's who aſſigning to them a ſtate of ſubſiſtence
and perception, do yet exclude them from the fruition of God,
without which there is no <hi>Reſt,</hi> untill the end of all, with ſuch
other <hi>by-perſwaſions,</hi> as would diſquiet the condition, or abridge
the glory of thoſe bleſſed ſoules, which yet were a facile under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
I ſhall draw towards a cloſe.</p>
            <p>There are 3 points yet remaining, I ſhall ſpeak onely to the
firſt of them, and that as an <hi>uſe</hi> of the <hi>doctrine</hi> laſt propoſed, and
I have done.</p>
            <p>1 Then you ſee <hi>there is an appointed determinate ſeaſon, wherein
all things and perſons, according to the will of God will runne into their
utmoſt iſſue and everlaſting condition.</hi> Thou art going, who ever
thou art, into an abiding condition, and there is a lot appointed
for thee, wherein lies an Eſtate everlaſtingly unchangeable. It is
the utmoſt end whereunto thou art deſigned, and when once
thou art entred into that lot, thou art everlaſtingly engaged: no
more change, no more alteration, if it be well with thee, it will
abide: if otherwiſe expect not any relief. In our few dayes we
live for Eternity, in our mutable eſtate we deal for an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
condition. It is not thus onely in reſpect of <hi>particulars,</hi> but
God hath <hi>appointed a day, wherein he will judge all the World by the
man whom he hath ordained.</hi> An End is comming unto all that
whole diſpenſation under which we are. To you who by the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of free grace have obtained union and communion with the
Lord Jeſus, Reſt and Peace, when God ſhall everlaſtingly raine
ſnares, fire and brimſtone upon the workers of Iniquity. Some
<hi>mock</hi> indeed, and ſay, <hi>where is the promiſe of his Comming?</hi> but we
know, <hi>the Lord is not ſlack, as ſome men count ſlackneſſe,</hi> but exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
patience untill the appointed ſeaſon, for the bringing about
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:166049:14"/>
of his own glorious Ends, which he hath determined concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his creatures. Why ſhould we then complain, when any one,
perhaps before our expectation, but yet according to Gods deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
makes an entrance into the end of all? All things work,
to that ſeaſon. This ſtate of things is not for continuance. That
which is incumbent, is in this uncertain ſpace of time alotted to
us, to give all diligence to make our calling and election ſure, as
alſo to ſerve the Lord faithfully in our Generations, wherein we
cannot be ſurprized: we have an example in him who is gone
before; It is true, the Lord Jeſus is our primitive pattern and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:
but thoſe alſo who have followed him, wherein they
have followed him, are to be eyed and marked as provocations to
the ſame labour of faith and love, wherein they were exerciſed.
And that this uſe may be made by this Aſſembly, I ſhall adde one
word concerning him from whom is the occaſion thereof.</p>
            <p>Every man ſtands in a threefold <hi>capacity.</hi> 1 Naturall 2 Civill.
3 Religious. And there are diſtinct <hi>Qualifications,</hi> that are ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto theſe ſeverall <hi>capacities.</hi> To the firſt as the ornaments
and perfections of Nature, are ſuited ſome ſeeds of thoſe <hi>Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
vertues, as courage, permanency in buſineſſe, &amp;c. which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in themſelves morally indifferent, have their foundations e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently
laid in the Natures of ſome perſons, which yet hinders
not, but that their good Improvement is of grace.</p>
            <p>2 To the ſecond, or mans civill capacity, there are many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies
relating as peculiar endowments, which may be referred
unto the three heads of <hi>Ability, Faithfulneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Induſtry,</hi> that
through them neither by <hi>weakneſſe, treachery</hi> nor <hi>ſloth</hi> the workes
and employments incumbent on men in their civill ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
may ſuffer.</p>
            <p>3 Mens peculiar ornament and emprovement in their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi>
capacitie, lies in thoſe <hi>fruits</hi> of the Spirit which we
call <hi>Chriſtian Graces:</hi> of theſe in reſpect of <hi>uſefulneſſe</hi> there
are three moſt eminent, <hi>viz. faith, love,</hi> and <hi>ſelfe-deniall.</hi> I ſpeak
of them upon another account then the Apoſtle doth, where he
placeth <hi>hope</hi> amongſt the <hi>firſt three</hi> of Chriſtian Graces. Now all
theſe in their ſeverall kindes vvere as eminent in the perſon decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in his ſeverall capacities, as perhaps is uſually found in any
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:166049:15"/>
one in a generation. My buſineſſe is not to make a <hi>Funerall</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
onely I ſuppoſe that without offence I may deſire, that in
<hi>courage</hi> and <hi>permanency</hi> in buſineſſe, (which I name in oppoſition
to that unſetled pragmatical ſhufling diſpoſition which is in ſome
men) in <hi>ability</hi> for wiſdome and counſell, in <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> to his
truſt and in his truſt, in <hi>indefatigable Induſtry</hi> in the purſuit of
the work committed to him, in <hi>faith</hi> on the promiſes of God,
and <hi>Acquaintance with his mind in his</hi> mighty works of providence,
in <hi>love</hi> to the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> and all his Saints, in a <hi>tender regard</hi> to
their <hi>Intereſt,</hi> delight in their ſociety, <hi>contempt</hi> of himſelf and all
<hi>his</hi> for the Goſpel's ſake, with eminent ſelf-deniall in all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments,
in <hi>impartiality</hi> and ſincerity in the execution of
juſtice, that in theſe and the like things we may have many raiſed
up in the power and ſpirit wherein he walked before the Lord,
and the Inhabitants of his Nation. This (I ſay) I hope I may
ſpeake without offence he upnn ſuch an occaſion as this;
my buſineſſe being occaſionally to preach the Word,
not to carry on a part of a Funerall Ceremonie,
I ſhall adde no more, but commit you
to him, who is able to prepare
you for your eternall
condition.</p>
