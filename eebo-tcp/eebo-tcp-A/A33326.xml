            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS <hi>Francis Drake</hi> was born neer unto South <hi>Tavistock</hi> in <hi>Devonshire</hi> of mean Parents.<note place="margin">His birth, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage.</note> His Godfather was <hi>Francis Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> who gave him his Name of <hi>Francis.</hi> His Father in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, was called in question for Religion, by reason of the six Articles set forth by the King against the Protestants, whereby he was feign to shift his habitation, and to retire into <hi>Kent.</hi> But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of King <hi>Henry,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the sixth, he obtained a place in the Navy Royal to read Divine Service: and after a while he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Deacon, and made Vicar of the Church of <hi>Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> upon the River of <hi>Medway.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet continuing poor (the place being of small value) he put forth this his Son to serve a neighbor Mariner that traded with a small Barke into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Zeland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> who brought him up in the Mariners Art, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Ingenuity, and Activity, took such liking to him, that (being a Bachelor) when he died, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed unto him his Bark.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, this <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> hearing of the preparations which were made by Sir <hi>John Hawkins</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a Voyage, <hi>Anno Christi</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1567. He sold his Bark, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59780:4"/>
joyned himself with him, which voyage proving dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asterous, at S. <hi>John de Vllva,</hi> he lost all he had, and hardly brought himself back.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His first voyage into the <hi>West-Indies.</hi>
               </note>Our <hi>Drake</hi> hereupon was forced to betake himself to his Mariners practice to repair his losses, by which, serving in a Man of War, he got good store of mony, whereupon he made a second voyage into the <hi>Spanish West-Indies</hi> to recover there what he had formerly lost, and with the ship of war, called the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and another ship, none knowing his intentions but his own Consorts, in the year 1572, on <hi>Whitsunday</hi> Eve, being <hi>May</hi> 24<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> himself being Captain of the Admiral, a ship of seventy Tuns, and his brother <hi>John Drake</hi> Captain of the Vice-Admiral called the <hi>Swan,</hi> of twenty five Tuns, having in both of them of men and boys seventy three, all Voluntiers, he so divided them that they were forty seven in one ship, &amp; twenty six in the other.</p>
            <p>These ships he furnished excellently with victuals, and apparel for a whole year; Providing also store of all manner of Ammunition, Artillery, Artificers stuff, and Tools, and whatsoever was requisite for such a man of war, in such an attempt: But especially he had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded five nimble Pinnaces, made at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken asunder, were stored aboard his ships, and ready to be set up as occasion served; with these he set sail from the sound of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> intending for <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The wind was fair and favourable, so that within twelve dayes they had sight of the <hi>Madara,</hi> and <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Islands, yet they never cast Anchor, nor made any stay for twenty five days after their setting forth; at which time they saw the Island of <hi>Guadalupe,</hi> one of the <hi>West Indie</hi> Islands, and the next morning they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred between <hi>Dominica</hi> and <hi>Guadalupe,</hi> and landed on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59780:4"/>
the South side of <hi>Dominica,</hi> where they remained three Days to refresh their men, and to take in fresh water, whereof there was plenty.</p>
            <p>The third Day in the afternoon they set sail for the Continent, or <hi>Terra firma</hi>; and the fifth day after they had fight of <hi>Sancta Martha,</hi> from which they steared their course towards <hi>Port Phesant</hi> (so named by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain <hi>Drake</hi> in his former Voyage, by reason of the great store of those Fowls in that place) and within six days after they safely arrived in that bay. Here did Captain <hi>Drake</hi> give order to his brother what to do in his absence, and well manning his Boats, went to the shore, where, upon a great Oak he found a plate of lead nailed, having in it this Inscription.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Captain</hi> Drake, <hi>if you happen to come to this Port, make hast away. For the</hi> Spaniards <hi>you here met with the last year have betrayed this place, and taken away all that you left here, &amp;c.</hi> Your loving friend <hi>John Garret</hi> of <hi>Plimouth.</hi> But notwithstanding this advertisment Captain <hi>Drake</hi> meant not to depart from this Port (which was so fit for his purpose) till he had set his Pinnaces together which he brought with him in his ships. And for his own, and his mens security, whilst the Carpenters were employed about that work, he made a kind of a Fort by the water side, by felling great Trees, and laying them one upon another.</p>
            <p>The next day after their arrival, came in also into that Port an <hi>English</hi> Bark of the Isle of <hi>Wight</hi> of Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Horseys,</hi> whereof <hi>James Rawse</hi> was Captain, and <hi>John Overy</hi> Master, with thirty men; These brought in with them a <hi>Spanish</hi> Carvel of <hi>Sivil,</hi> being sent with Advise to <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> and also a Shallop, both which they had taken by the way. And Captain <hi>Rawse,</hi> understanding the design of Captain <hi>Drake,</hi> desired to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59780:5"/>
joyn with them, and upon Articles agreed on, he was admitted.</p>
            <p>Within seven days the Pinnaces were fitted, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for service, and other businesses dispatched, so that setting sail in the morning toward <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> they held on their course till they came to the Isles of <hi>Pines</hi> upon the third day; at which place they found two Frigates of <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> lading Planks and tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from thence. The <hi>Negroes</hi> in those Frigats informed them of the state of the Town; and told them that some souldiers were daily looked for from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Panama</hi> to defend the Town of <hi>Nombre de dios</hi> against the <hi>Symerons,</hi> who were Blacks that formerly had fled from their <hi>Spanish</hi> masters by reason of their cruelty, and were by this time grown to a nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two Kings, who had almost surprised it about six weeks before.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Drake,</hi> having learned what he could of them, set these <hi>Negroes</hi> on shore, that they might go to their Countrey-men the <hi>Symerons,</hi> and to prevent any notice that they might give to <hi>Nombre de dios</hi> of his approach; &amp; so hasted his going thither. For which end he disposed of all his companies, leaving the three ships and Carvel with Captain <hi>Rawse,</hi> and chose into his Pinnaces (making the Shallop one) fifty three of his own company, and twenty of Captain <hi>Rawse</hi>'s: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding fit arms for them: <hi>viz.</hi> six Targets, six Firepikes, twelve Pikes, twenty four Muskets and Calievers, six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Bows, six Partizans, two Drums, and two Trumpets.</p>
            <p>Then leaving their company, they arrived at the Island of <hi>Catavaas,</hi> where landing early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Captain <hi>Drake</hi> there trained his men, and delivered them their several Arms, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> hitherto he had kept safe in good casks, encouraging them to the enterprise by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59780:5"/>
setting before them the weakness of the Town, being unwalled, the unexpectedness of their coming and the great Richer, and honor that was to be gained if they effected it. And in the afternoon he set sail for <hi>Nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre de Dios,</hi> and before Sun-set,<note place="margin">He comes to <hi>Nombre de Dios.</hi>
               </note> gat as far as <hi>Rio Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco</hi>: from whence, keeping close to the shore that they might not be discovered by the Watch-house, they came within two leagues of the Point of the Bay, where he caused them to strike a Hull, and to cast out their graplers, till it was dark; when night was coming, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting sail, and rowing hard and silently, they recovered the Point of the Harbour, purposing not to attempt the Town till Day-breake. But Captain <hi>Drake</hi> hearing that some of his men began to talk of the difficulty and danger of the enterprise, to put by these conceits, he tooke the opportunity of the rising Moon to perswade them that it was Day, so that they got to the Town an hour before the Day brake.</p>
            <p>In the Harbour they found a <hi>Spanish</hi> Ship of sixty Tuns, newly come in, laden with <hi>Canary</hi> Wines and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commodities, which spying so many Pinnaces, sent his Boat presently a shoar to give the Town warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which Captain <hi>Drake</hi> perceiving, cut betwixt her and the Town, and forced her to go to the other side of the Bay: so that he landed his men without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment. Vpon the Platform they found six Pieces of Ordnance ready mounted, some halfe, some whole Culverines. These they presently dismounted, and the Town tooke the Alarm, which they were the readier to do, because they were oft disquieted by the <hi>Syme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,</hi> who caused the Great Bell to be rung out, and Drums run up and down the Town.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Drake,</hi> according to the directions he had given before, left twelve men to keep the Pinnaces, that

he might assure a safe retreat, if need should be, and before he would enter the Town he thought fit to view the mount, on the east side, where, as he was informed, they had planted Ordnance to scower all about the Town; therefore leaving half his men at the foot of the mount, himself with the other half, speedily marched up to the top, where finding no Guns, they as speedily descended; and appointing his Brother, with <hi>John Oxenham,</hi> and sixteen of his men to go about behind the Kings Treasure-house, to enter the east-end of the market-place, himself with the rest, passed up the broad-street with sound of Drum, and Trumpet.</p>

               <note place="margin">and takes it.</note>The Fire-pikes in both the companies affrighted the enemy, and gave light to the <hi>English,</hi> whilst the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants stood amazed at the strange sight, and hearing Drums and Trumpets sounding in sundry places, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>English</hi> to be far more than they were. Yet by reason of the time spent in marching up and down the Mount, the Souldi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rs and Inhabitants of the Town had put themselves in Arms neer to the Governors house, &amp; not far from the gate of the town, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was only one, leading towards <hi>Panama,</hi> meaning (as it seemed) either to shew their valour in the Governors sight, or, if need were, to have the better opportunity for their flight.</p>
            <p>And to make shew of a greater number of shot than they had, they had hung lines with lighted matches overthwart the end of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, and at the approach of the <hi>English</hi> they gave them a Volley of shot, yet levelling so low that the Bullets oft grazed on the ground. The <hi>English</hi> stood not to answer them in the same kind; but having once discharged their Guns, and feathered with their Arrows, they came to the push of Pike, and their Fire-pikes being well armed did them notable service:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59780:7"/>
And with the Butt ends of their Guns, and other short weapons (Captain <hi>Drakes</hi> Brother and his Company entring at the same time another way) they charged them so furiously, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> threw down their weapons and ran away. And in the pursuit, and return of the <hi>English,</hi> many of them were wounded by the enemies weapons which lay very thick and cross one another.</p>
            <p>At their return they made a stand near the midst of the Market-place, whence Captain <hi>Drake</hi> sent some of his men to stay the Ringing of the Bell: But the Church being strongly built and fast shut, they could not get in without firing it, which Captain <hi>Drake</hi> would not suffer, and having taken two or three <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their flight, he commanded them to conduct them to the Governours House, where they ordinarily unladed their Mules that brought the treasure from <hi>Panama.</hi> But though the silver was kept there, yet the gold, pearl, and jewels was from thence carried to the King trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure-house which stood not far off.</p>
            <p>At the coming of the <hi>English</hi> to the Governors house,<note place="margin">The vast treasure found there.</note> they found the gate open, a candle lighted upon the top of the stairs, and a fair Gennet ready sadled for the Governor; by means of which light, they saw a huge heap of silver in that nether Room, being a pile of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bars of about 70 foot in length, 10 foot in breadth, and 12 foot in heigth, each bar being near 40 pound in weight. Yet did Captain <hi>Drake</hi> straitly command his men not to meddle with any of it, but to stand to their Arms, because the town was full of people, and in the Kings treasure-house, nearer the water, there was more gold and jewels than all their 4 pinnaces could carry,<note place="margin">All cover, all loose.</note> which he intended they should presently break open.</p>
            <p>No sooner were the <hi>English</hi> returned to their Guard
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59780:8"/>
but a report was brought them that their Pinnaces were in danger of being taken, and that if they staied till day they would be opprest with multitudes both of Souldiers and townsmen: wherefore Captain <hi>Drake</hi> sent his brother, and <hi>John Oxenham</hi> to the water side to know the truth, who indeed found their men much affrighted by reason that they saw great companies of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> running up and down the town (which was as big as <hi>Plimouth</hi>) with lighted matches, which also sometimes shot at them.</p>
            <p>Presently after a violent shower of rain powred down so vehemently that before the <hi>English</hi> could get the shelter of a Penthouse, some of their Bow-strings were wet, and their match and powder spoiled, which before they could renew, some of them were muttering about the strength of the enemy, which Captain <hi>Drake</hi> overhearing, said, <hi>I have brought you to the very mouth of the treasure of the world, and if you go away without it, you can blame no body but your selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The storm (which lasted about half an hour) being ended, Captain <hi>Drake,</hi> desiring to put these fears out of his mens heads, and to allow the enemy no longer respite to gather themselves together, stept forward, commanding his brother and some others to break open the Kings treasure-house, and the rest to guard the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place till the business was dispatched. But as he stept forward his strength and fight,<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Drake</hi> Swoons.</note> and speech failed him by reason of abundance of blood which he had lost out of a wound received in his leg at the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, which indeed was so much, when they looked after it, that they thought it impossible for one man to loose. Insomuch as they which were before most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, began now to prefer their Captains life before that vast Treasure: and therefore having recovered
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59780:8"/>
him with some hot water, and bound up his wound with a Scarf that stopt the bleeding, they intreated him to be content to go with them aboard, that his wound might be better searched and drest.</p>
            <p>This he would by no means be perswaded to, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it would be impossible, after such a respite to return to effect the work they came for, thinking it more honorable for himself there to die than to leave so high an enterprise unperformed. Yet some of them having already gotten some good booty, by force mingled with fair words, carried him away to his Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, judging that by his Life they might recover wealth sufficient, but if they lost him,<note place="margin">He is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away</note> they should hardly recover their own home.</p>
            <p>Thus embarquing by break of day, having (besides the Captain) many men wounded, though none slain but one Trumpeter, whilst the Chyrurgeons were busie in dressing them, before they departed the Harbor, they took the said ship of wines to cheer up their men: but before they had got her out of the haven, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had remounted one of their Culverins, and made a shot at them, which yet hindred them not from carrying away the ship to the Isle of <hi>Victuals,</hi> which lies without the Bay Westward about a League off the Town, where they staid two Days to cure their wounded and to refresh themselves in those pleasant Gardens, abounding with all sort of dainty Roots, and Fruits, besides great plenty of Poultrey, and other Fowls, no less strange than delicate.</p>
            <p>Presently after their arrival there, came a proper, and well spoken Gentleman to Captain <hi>Drake,</hi> indeed to view in what state they were, but protesting that he came of his meer good will to see the Captain for that he had undertaken so incredible an enterprize with so
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59780:9"/>
few men: Adding, that at first they suspected them to be <hi>French,</hi> from whom they could expect no mercy; but when they perceived by their Arrows that they were <hi>English,</hi> their fears were the less, because they knew that though they took their treasure, yet they would not be cruel to their persons. He told him also that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor had consented to his coming; yea, had directly sent him, because there were some in Town that said, they knew the <hi>English</hi> Captain, who the two last years had been upon their Coast, and had always used their persons civily. He therefore desired to know whether it was the same Captain <hi>Drake</hi> or no? Whether the <hi>English</hi> Arrows were poisoned with which their men were wounded? How their wounds might be cured? And lastly, whether they wanted Victuals, or other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries, with which the Governor was ready to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them so far as he durst? Captain <hi>Drake</hi> (though he took him for a Spy) yet used him courteously, and answered to his demands, That he was the same <hi>Drake,</hi> that they meant. That it was never his manner to poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son his Arrows. That their wounded might be cured by ordinary Chyrurgery: And that he could sufficiently supply all his wants in that Island. Adding, that he wanted nothing but some of that special commodity, which that country yielded, to satisfie himself and his company. He advised the Governor therefore to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant, for that before he departed, he would (by Gods leave, and assistance) share with them in some of their Treasure.</p>
            <p>To this the Gentleman replied, that if he might move the question without offence, what was the reason that being possessed of the town they should so soon leave it wherein there was above 360 tun of silver, and much more gold in value, in the Kings treasure-house; Capt.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59780:9"/>
               <hi>Drake</hi> told him the true cause of their retreat, &amp; how unwillingly he was carried aboard. The Gentleman ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that he had no less cause in departing than he had shewed valor in attempting. Thus after fair entertaiment, and some gifts bestowed upon him by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain <hi>Drake,</hi> after dinner he was dismissed, &amp; protesting that he was never so much honoured by any in his life.</p>
            <p>After his departure, a <hi>Negro</hi> that had fled to them, being examined, informed them how they might have gold and silver enough, by means of the <hi>Symerons,</hi> to whom though himself was hateful because he had betraied them to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> yet if Captain <hi>Drake</hi> would protect him, he would adventure his life to serve him therein. This gave cause of further consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and because the Island where they were was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther safe nor healthy, the next morning they set sail for the Isle of <hi>Pinos</hi> (or <hi>Port Plenty</hi>) where they had left their ships. By the way Captain <hi>Drake</hi> sent his Brother, and one <hi>Ellis Hixon</hi> to the westward to search the river <hi>Cagro,</hi> which he had discovered the year before, desiring to have further knowledge of it, because it tended Southward within six leagues of <hi>Panama,</hi> upon which river, at a town called <hi>Venta Cruz</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they used to imbark their treasures that by Mules was brought from <hi>Panama,</hi> and so to send it by water to <hi>Nombre de Dios.</hi> This cost them three days rowing to get as far as <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> but they came back in a day and a night.</p>
            <p>When Captain <hi>Drake</hi> came to his ships, Capt. <hi>Rawse</hi> suspecting that they could not now safely continue upon that coast being thus discovered, was willing to depart, and Capt. <hi>Drake</hi> was as willing to dismiss him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Aug.</hi> 7. taking his leave, he left them in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Isle, where they had remained five or 6 days. After which, having put all things in readiness, Capt. <hi>Drake</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59780:10"/>
with his two ships, and three Pinnaces to go to <hi>Carthagena,</hi> and six days after he came to Anchor with his ships between the Islands of <hi>Charestra,</hi> and S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards,</hi> and himself led the three Pinnaces about the Island into the harbor of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> where they found a Frigate at Anchor, aboard which was only one old man, who told them that the rest of his company was gone a shore to fight about a Mistress, telling Capt. <hi>Drake</hi> also that a little before, there speedily passed by a Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, calling to him and asking whether there had not lately been there some <hi>English,</hi> and <hi>Frenchmen</hi>? and being told that there had not, he hasted away; after which he saw divers small ships, bringing themselves under the Castle.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Drake,</hi> farther learned by him that within the next point, rode a great ship of <hi>Syvil,</hi> that being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaden, was the next morning bound for S. <hi>Domingo</hi>: wherefore taking this old man with him, he rowed to that ship and with his Pinnaces presently boarded her, though with some difficulty by reason of her height. As soon as they had entred they threw down their gates, and Spardecks to prevent the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from hurting them with their close fights; who seeing the <hi>English</hi> possessed of their ship, stowed themselves all in hold, except 2 or 3 that were before the Beete; then see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no further danger, they cut her Cable at half, &amp; with their Pinnaces towed her out from the Island, right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the town, yet without danger of their great shot.</p>
            <p>The town taking the Alarm, rung out their Bells, shot off 30 great guns, and drew their horse and foot, with their shot, if they could, to hinder their going out. The next morning Capt. <hi>Drakes</hi> ships took two frigates, who came from <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> to <hi>Carthagena</hi> with letters of advise, to certifie them what Captain <hi>Drake</hi> had done
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59780:10"/>
there, and therefore to wish them to stand upon their Guard.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Drake</hi> now considering that he was discovered in two of the chiefest places of all that coast, yet resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to depart till he had found the <hi>Symerons,</hi> and made a good voyage: But this requiring length of time, he resolved to burn one of his ships, and to make the other his store-house, that so his Pinnaces might be thorowly manned. But knowing how loth his company would be to part with either of their ships, being both so good Sailors, and so well furnished, he sent for the Carpenter out of the <hi>Swan,</hi> and taking him into his Cabin, he charged him privately to go down into the well of the ship, and to bore three holes as neer to the Keel as he could, and then to set something before the holes, that the issuing in of the water might not be heard. The Carpenter being dismaid with this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, desired to know the cause why he would sink so good a ship, new, and strong: Adding that if his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Master, and other Company should know it, they would surely kill him. Then did Captain <hi>Drake</hi> tell him his reasons for it, promising that it should not be known till all of them were glad of it: and so he did it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>The next morning Capt. <hi>Drake</hi> would in his Pinnace go a Fishing, and calling for his brother in the <hi>Swan,</hi> would have him go with him, who rising suddenly, said that he would follow him presently. Capt. <hi>Drake</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the work was done, asked why their Bark was so deep? whereupon his brother sent one down to know whether there were any water in the ship? the steward going down, was up to the wast in water, and cryed out that the ship was full of water. Hereupon some ran to the Pump, and others to search out the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59780:11"/>
Leak. But notwithstanding all their pains and diligence they could neither clear her of water, nor find the leak. Then Capt. <hi>Drake</hi> advised that she should be burnt that the enemy might never recover her, and to satisfie them (who were very unwilling) he made his brother Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Admiral, and placed the Master of the <hi>Swan</hi> with him, and himself would go in his Pinnace: then did every one take out what they lacked, and liked, and Captain <hi>Drake</hi> had what he desired,<note place="margin">He burns one of his Ships.</note> and men enough for his Pinnaces.</p>
            <p>The next morning they set sail for the sound of <hi>Darri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> in 5 days they recovered, and then retiring into a place out of all trade, they reposed themselves pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately for 15 days, that the enemy might think them quite gone from the coast. During which time some built them houses: others exercised themselves to shoot at Buts: others trimmed the Pinnaces to make them the sitter for sailing, and rowing: others provided fresh vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals of Fish, Fowl, Hogs, Deer, Conies, &amp;c. whereof there was great plenty. Then Captain <hi>Drake</hi> leaving his ship with his brother, took two of the Pinnaces to go to <hi>Rio Grand.</hi> By the way, seeing on the Land great store of Cattle, Captain <hi>Drake</hi> contenting them for their pains, the <hi>Indians</hi> furnished him with as much provision of them as he desired.</p>
            <p>The same day about three a clock, they entred <hi>Rio Grand,</hi> rowing up the stream till dark night, but the current was so strong that they gat but two leagues all that time; that night they had a terrible storm with thunder and lightning, after which they were extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled with <hi>Muskitos</hi> (like our Gnats) that they could get little rest. The next morning early they pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up the river, meeting none till three in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and then they spied a Canow with two <hi>Indians</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59780:11"/>
fishing: and about five a clock, they spied some houses of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to which when they came, the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants were fled, where they found store of Bacon, Cheese, Sweet-meats, Conserves, and Sugar; with these they loaded their Pinnaces, and so returned back again down the River; at the mouth whereof, they cleansed their Pinnaces, and steered Westward till they came to their ship, and company, and by the way they took two frigates well stored with live Hogs, Hens, and Maiz, which (dismissing the men) they kept for their own provision. Yea their store which then, and afterwards they took was such, that they relieved the <hi>Symerons,</hi> and two <hi>French</hi> ships that were in extreme want.</p>
            <p>During their absence, Captain <hi>John Drake</hi> in his Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace went into the Main, and espying some <hi>Symerons,</hi> had dealt so effectually with them, that leaving two of his men with their Captain, he gave him two <hi>Symerons,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to meet again the next day. These two being intelligent men, declared to Captain <hi>Drake,</hi> how glad they were of his coming, knowing him to be an enemy to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that their Captain and company would stay for him at the mouth of <hi>Rio Diego.</hi> Captain <hi>Drake</hi> having consulted about the business, resolved to take his brother, and the two <hi>Symerons</hi> and with his two Pinnaces to go to the said river, giving order that the rest of his fleet should follow him the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, because there was a place both of great safety and plenty.</p>
            <p>When they arrived there they found the <hi>Symerons</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they had promised, where after mutual kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, they took in two more of the <hi>Symerons,</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to meet them and others of their country-men at <hi>Rio Guana.</hi> In the mean time Captain <hi>Drakes</hi> ship was pittifully shaken with a great tempest; but having
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59780:12"/>
trimed her, they brought her safe into the Channel, and there moored her. The <hi>Symerons</hi> coming (as they had appointed) Captain <hi>Drake</hi> asked them how they could furnish him with some of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> gold, and silver, they answered, that they had taken store from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> not for love of it, but to despite them, which they had sunk in Rivers, which they could not now recover because the Rivers were high: and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in these rainy months used not to carry their treasure by Land.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Drake</hi> to entertain his company for these five months, commanded all his Ordnance and Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a shoar, making a fort for their safety, and by the help of the <hi>Symerons,</hi> raised two large houses for all his company. In the mean time, Captain <hi>Drake</hi> leaving his brother to look to those affairs, with three Pinnaces went againe for <hi>Carthagena,</hi> where when they arrived they let fall their Grappers between the Island of <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> and the main. The Governor sent to know why he stayd so long upon their coast? He answered, to traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique with them, having Tin, Pewter, Cloth, &amp;c. which they needed. The Governor replyed, that the King had forbidden them to trade with any, except for powder and shot of which if he had store, he would be his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant? Captain <hi>Drake</hi> answered that he came to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change his Commodities for Silver &amp; Gold, and meant not to return without it. Here he took two Frigates, whereof he sunk the one, and burned the other, not being able to man them And after a while, being out of hope of any purchase there, much of their Victuals being spent, and spoiled, they put forth to Sea though the weather was very stormy. Many days they sailed and could get no provision, the Westernly winds not suffering them to return to their ship: At last when all
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59780:12"/>
their provisions were almost spent, and they hopeless, they espied a Frigate, which proved <hi>Spanish</hi>; Her they pursued, and so soon as the weather would suffer them, boarded and took, wherein they found store of provision, which they took, as sent them by God: After this they landed on the Main, and by setting the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> lately taken at liberty, they procured more provisions from some <hi>Indians</hi> that were under a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Governor.</p>
            <p>Presently after many of Capt. <hi>Drakes</hi> men fell sick, yet it pleased God that none died but only a Quarter Master, he was also a very good Marriner, and so at last they returned to their ship, where they were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with the heavy news of the death of Captain <hi>John Drake,</hi> and another, both slain as they attempted the boarding of a Frigate, presently after the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Pinnaces from them. Here did Captain <hi>Drake</hi> continue for a month, keeping close that they might not be discovered, during which time there fell a sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness amongst his men whereof <hi>Joseph Drake,</hi> another of his Brothers, died, and some others,</p>
            <p>At last the <hi>Symerons</hi> brought him word that for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet was come to <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi>:<note place="margin">He march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es towards <hi>Panama.</hi>
               </note> yet did he send forth the <hi>Lyon</hi> to make further disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, which soon tooke a Frigate laden with Maiz, Hens, and Pompions, which assured them of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival. Then did he after advice taken prepare all things for his journey by land to <hi>Panama,</hi> and having now buried twenty eight of his men, he left <hi>Ellis Hix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with his ship and other Company, giving charge that they should not believe any messenger that should come in his name, except they saw his hand writing. And so upon <hi>Shrove-Teusday,</hi> accompanied with 48 men, whereof 18 only were <hi>English,</hi> the rest <hi>Symerons,</hi> he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59780:13"/>
began his journey, every one besides his Arms, carrying much victuals, and what was wanting by the way, the <hi>Symerons</hi> with their Arrows provided from time to time.</p>
            <p>About the midst of his journey they came to a very high Mountain,<note place="margin">Sees the south-sea.</note> upon the top whereof was a goodly Tree which when he had ascended, he saw from thence the South Sea, whereupon he besought of God that of his goodness he would giue him life and leave once to sail in an <hi>English</hi> ship in those Seas, with which resolution he acquainted <hi>John Oxenham,</hi> who present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly protested that unless he beat him from his company, he (by Gods grace) would attend him in that Voyage. At last they came into a Champion Country where, as they passed over some Hills, they saw <hi>Panama</hi> five or six times a day, and the last day they saw the ships ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Road. Coming within a League of <hi>Panama</hi> they went into a Grove wherein they might lie safely undiscovered neer the highway that leads from thence to <hi>Nombre de Dios.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thence he sent a <hi>Symeron,</hi> apparelled like the Blacks of <hi>Panama</hi> to learn the certain night, and time of the night, when the Treasure was to come by. He quickly brought back word that the treasurer of <hi>Lima</hi> was that night to come by with 14 Mules, whereof 8 were laden with gold, one with jewels, and the rest with silver; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this notice they presently marched till they came within two Leagues of <hi>Venta Cruz</hi>; and here Captain <hi>Drake</hi> disposed his men, half of one side of the way with himself, and half on the other side with <hi>John Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enham.</hi> They had not lain there above an hour before they heard the <hi>Recoes</hi> coming. And though all were charged not to stir till a fit time, yet one <hi>Robert pike,</hi> having drunk <hi>Aqua vita</hi> too freely, hearing a Cavalier
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59780:13"/>
ride by, starts up to see who it was, whereby discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself, the Cavalier galloped away to inform the <hi>Recoes</hi> of some danger which he apprehended, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded them to stop their Mules, and to send before them those which were laden only with victuals, which accordingly was done: and when these came, they seized on them, amongst which they found only two horse-load of silver, and were told,<note place="margin">Misseth the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</note> that being discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before day they would have all the forces of City, and Country come upon them: whereupon Capt. <hi>Drake</hi> being thus disappointed of his hopes, resolved rather to march by the way of <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> though it was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, than to return by so long and tedious a way as he came, the <hi>Symerons</hi> promising to stand by him in all dangers. So having refreshed his men with victuals, whereof they had plenty, they took their journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> and when they came neer, they were encountred by a Company of Souldiers, who having discharged a full Volley of shot upon them, wherein they hurt some, and wounded one mortally, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> returned them the like both with their shot and arrows, and so ran upon them with intent to come to handy blows: but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> fled most of them into a wood by, from whence they shot at them, wounding some, and killing a <hi>Symeron</hi>; then did Capt. <hi>Drake</hi> with his men enter the Town; where some got some good pillage, and so hastened away,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Venta Cruz</hi> taken.</note> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> not daring to pursue them: they passed on thorow many dangers and difficulties to their ship and company, where they were received with great joy, though many were much troubled for loss of the Gold.</p>
            <p>Then, taking further counsel, he sent <hi>John Oxenham</hi> in the <hi>Bear</hi> to the Eastward to take some ships laden with Victuals, which at that time used to go to <hi>Nombre
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59780:14"/>

            <p>A while after, having set all things in a readiness, they went out to Sea in the Frigate, together with the <hi>French</hi> ship, and Capt. <hi>Drake</hi> ordered 12 of his own men, and 16 of the <hi>Symerons,</hi> to go back and see what was become of the <hi>French</hi> Captain, and what of the

               <p>Captain <hi>Drake</hi> having in his former Voyage had a sight of the South Sea, he was restless in his desires to sail in an <hi>English</hi> bottom upon it: yet was he for some years hindred, partly thorow envy of some at home, and partly thorow employment abroad into <hi>Ireland</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Walter</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> to whom he did much Noble service both by Sea and Land. Yet against the year 1577, he procured a Commission from the Queen,<note place="margin">His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations</note> and with the help of divers Friends, Adventurers, he fitted himself with five ships. The <hi>Pellican,</hi> Admiral: of 100 Tun burden: himself the Captain. The <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Vice-Admiral, of 80 Tuns: Captain <hi>John Winter.</hi> The <hi>Marigold,</hi> of 30 Tun: <hi>John Thomas</hi> Captain.

               <p>These ships had in them 264 able men, and were well furnished with all necessary provisions: and had some Pinnaces ready framed, stowed abroad, ready to be set up when occasion served. He had also skilful Musicians, Rich Furniture, the Vessels for his Table, and some for his Kitchin of pure Silver, and divers other sorts of Curious Workmanship, to shew the Riches and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificence of His Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:59780:16"/>Being thus furnished, they set sail from <hi>Plymouth, Nov.</hi> 15. 1577. but the wind coming contrary, they were forced to put into <hi>Falmouth</hi>: and to repair dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, they were forced to stay till <hi>Decemb.</hi> 13. The first place they touched at, was the Isle of <hi>Mogadore</hi> within the Dominion of the King of <hi>Fess.</hi> From whence they departed, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 31. to Cape <hi>Barbas,</hi> and after they had refreshed themselves there for six days and stored themselves with fish, they set sail for <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> and touched at the Isle of <hi>Maio,</hi> a very fruitful place, where they found store of Figs, Coco-nuts, Plantanes, great heards of Goats, and flocks of wild Hens. From hence they passed by the Isle of S. <hi>Jagô,</hi> and came to the Isle of <hi>Fogo,</hi> in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is a steep hill of about 18 miles to the top, wherein is a fiery furnace, which four times a day sends forth flames &amp; abundance of Pumice-stones, the rest of the Island is fruitful and inhabited by <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals.</hi> Two Leagues off is another Island called <hi>Brava</hi> abounding with trees, ever green, fruits, and other Commodities: as figs, cocoes, plantans, oranges, lemons, citrons, &amp;c But the sea is so deep about it that there is no Anchoring. At <hi>Cape Verde</hi> they took in fresh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and <hi>Feb.</hi> the second, set forwards for the Straights to pass into the South-sea.</p>
               <p>By the way they came to the coast of <hi>Brasile,</hi> and passed on south-ward to the river of <hi>Plate,</hi> where they all met, and not finding a convenient Harbor there, they passed on till <hi>May</hi> 18. 1578. where, in another Bay they came to an Anchor. Here Captain <hi>Drake</hi> unloaded the <hi>Swan,</hi> and brake her to pieces that he might bring his men into a neerer compass, and neer hereto were some Islands upon which they took as many Sea-calves, and several sorts of Fowl as they pleased: and so having taken in such provisions as they needed, <hi>June</hi> 3. they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59780:16"/>
set sail from thence, and <hi>June</hi> 12. came into another Bay, where they discharged the <hi>Christopher</hi> and laid her up. <hi>June</hi> 19. they found here the ship which they had lost long before in a storm: and so they entred <hi>Port S. Jalian</hi> to refresh their wearied men, and to cherish them who in their absence had sustained much mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Here Captain <hi>Drake</hi> and some others going a shore were assaulted by the Natives, called <hi>Pentagons</hi> from their huge stature: these slew two of his men, but one of them being slain, the rest fled, and Captain <hi>Drake</hi> returned to his ships.</p>
               <p>Whilst they remained here,<note place="margin">A conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</note> there was a conspiracy discovered, a gentleman in the company having design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to murther the General, and to overthrow the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: This being proved against him before a Council of war, he at last confessed it, and being therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die, he was put to his choice, whether he would be set ashore amongst the Natives, or sent into <hi>England</hi> to answer it before the Queen and Council, or whether he would be executed there: He chose the last, and having prepared himself for death, had his head cut off.</p>
               <p>Here the General discharged the <hi>Mary,</hi> a <hi>Portugal</hi> Prize, because she was leaky, and so having wooded, watered and trimmed his ships, having now only three ships remaining, <hi>Aug.</hi> 17. they departed setting their course for the Straights, and changed the name of his own ship from the <hi>Pelicane</hi> to the <hi>Golden Hind.</hi> And in their passage thorow the Straights they came to a fair and fruitful Island, where some of them going a shore with the General they took possession of it in Her Majesties name, &amp; called it <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Island.<note place="margin">He comes to the straights.</note> Here they found on other Islands, many Penguins, of which in one day they killed 3000, which they found to be good

                  <hi>Sept.</hi> 6. They entred into the South-sea, the Straight being about 150 Leagues in length, in some places broader, and in other narrower: Their entrance into this sea was <hi>Sept.</hi> 7. presently after which, they met with a terrible Tempest which continued long, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as <hi>Sept.</hi> 30. the <hi>Marigold</hi> was separated from them whereof <hi>John Thomas</hi> was Captain,<note place="margin">He loses two of his ships.</note> which they could never after meet with.

The storm (thorow Gods mercy) being turned into a calm, they shaped their course towards the Coast of <hi>Peru,</hi> which proved very Mountainous and barren, without water and wood except some places inhabited by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> wherefore they ran off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to an Island called <hi>Mucho,</hi> which they found to be fruitful and well stored with Maiz, Sheep, and other Cattel. Here he intended to water, and take in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but the treacherous <hi>Indians</hi> killed two of his men
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59780:17"/>
on shore, and with their Arrows wounded all the men that were with him in the Boat, and himself was very dangerously wounded under the eye. Hereupon the General set sail again for the Main to get water, and fresh victuals for his weak and wounded men, and they came to an Anchor in <hi>Philips Bay,</hi> whence he sent a Boat for discovery, which brought back an <hi>Indian</hi> whom they took as he was fishing: By his means they gat some small relief, but that would not serve turn, wherefore a Captain of the <hi>Indians,</hi> being pleased with their gifts, and courteous usage, conducted them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place where they had a plentiful supply of what their necessities required. There also they met with a <hi>Spanish</hi> ship wherein they found some fine gold of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divia,</hi> and a great Cross of gold beset with Emeralds, and a God of the same metal nailed to it: of this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den they eased the ship.</p>
               <p>Then being very desirous to meet with their lost ships, they sought out an harbor where they might trim their ship, and set up their shallop, to enable them to search every creek for them. From the first place they came to they were driven by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with the death of one of their men: But <hi>Decemb.</hi> 20. they met with a place wherein they did their intended work. And after the Pinnace was fitted, himself with some others went to seek for their ships, till the wind forced them back again, and then with their ship they proceeded in their voyage.</p>
               <p>As they sailed along,<note place="margin">His boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of treasure.</note> they came to a place called <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapaca,</hi> where landing to seek fresh water, they found a <hi>Spaniard</hi> asleep, with 13 Bars of silver lying by him, weighing about 4000 <hi>Spanish</hi> Ducats: Of these they eased him, and returned to their Boat. Landing in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place they met a <hi>Spaniard</hi> driving eight <hi>Peruvian</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59780:18"/>
sheep that carried in Bags about 800 weight of fine silver, which they also took along with them. A little farther they traded with some <hi>Indians</hi> to whom they gave knives, beads, and such trifles, and received by exchange many good things that they stood in need of; and amongst others some of those <hi>Peruvian</hi> sheep, whose heighth and length was equal to a pretty Cow, and their strength exceeding their stature. They have necks like Camels; their wool is exceeding fine, their flesh good meat; and they supply the room of horses both for burden, and travel. In the Province of <hi>Cusco,</hi> the common ground, wheresoever it's taken up,in every hundred pound weight of earth, yields 25 s. of pure silver, after the rate of five shillings an ounce.</p>
               <p>From thence <hi>Feb.</hi> 7. They came to the Port town of <hi>Arica,</hi> where, in two Barks, they found forty and odd bars of silver, each weighing 20 pounds, of which they eased them. And as they passed on they met with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Bark laden with linnen, some of which they took for their own use. <hi>Feb.</hi> 15. They came to <hi>Lima,</hi> in which Port were 30 <hi>Spanish</hi> ships, yet they entred and cast Anchor all night in the midst of them. Here they heard of a ship wherein were 1500 bars of silver, besides silks, linnen, and a chest full of Royals of Plate: As also of another ship loaden with gold, and silver for <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>: Hence therefore they hasted next morning en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to overtake that gallant ship, called <hi>Caca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuego,</hi> which was gone from <hi>Lima</hi> 14 days before them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> first, They fell with Cape <hi>Francisco,</hi> where about midday they descried a ship a head of them, which was that they looked for: but by the way, they had taken a ship, laden with wine: and another, laden with tacklings,<note place="margin">The <hi>Caca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuego</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> 16. Being now quite out of hope of meeting with their lost ships, they came to the Isle of <hi>Caines,</hi> and Anchored in a fresh river, where they spent some days in taking in wood, water, and other necessaries: and in their passage they met with another ship laden with <hi>China</hi> silk, <hi>China</hi> dishes, and a Falcon of gold with a great Emerald set in his breast. <hi>April</hi> 15. <hi>Anno</hi> 1578. They came into the harbor of <hi>Guatuleo,</hi> inhabited with <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with whom they had some trading, and received of them many things which they needed, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially bread: and so being sufficiently provided of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries, they left the coast of <hi>America,</hi> yet not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take with them a pot of about a bushel in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, full of Royals of Plate, and a chain of gold, and some jewels which they met with in the Town.</p>

They set their course directly into the sea, which they continued to <hi>June</hi> third till they came into the forty second degree of North latitude, where they met with such a strange change from heat to cold that much impaired the health of many of them. This much discouraged many of them, and made them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair of finding any passage that way; yet would not the General be disheartened, but cheered them up by comfortable speeches of the Divine Providence, and of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59780:19"/>
Gods care over his children out of the Scriptures: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereto his own cheerful example, stirring them up to endure some short extremity to have the speedier comfort, and a little trouble to have the greater glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which made them resolve to see the uttermost of what good was to be done that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 5. They were forced to run in with the shoar by reason of contrary winds; the Road was bad, and dangerous by reason of extreme gusts, and flawes that beat upon them: Hereupon not staying long there, in regard of the extremity of cold they were forced to turn Southward: and <hi>June</hi> 17. they came to an Anchor in a fit Harbour, where yet they met with much cold; then some of their men went a shore to set up tents, and to make a fortress wherein to secure their goods whilst they trimmed their ship: The people of the country came in multitudes to them, wondering at every thing they saw, and esteeming them to be Gods, though they did what they could to undeceive them: They gave them shirts, linnen cloths, &amp;c. wherewith to cover their nakedness and to hide their shame, and they returned feathers, cawls of net-work: their Quivers for their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows made of Fawns-skins, &amp;c. Presently after came there King whom they called <hi>Hioh,</hi> and set his Crown upon the Generals Head, enriched his neck with chains, and by signs resigned to him his right and title in that whole Land; wherefore in the Name, and to the use of Her Majesty, he took the Scepter, Crown, and Dignity of the said Country into his hand, wishing that it had lyen fit for Her Majesty to enjoy, and that the riches, and treasure wherewith the Inland part abounds, might be conveniently transported into <hi>England,</hi> and that the Gospel might be propagated to these Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and harmless people.</p>

Near to this Country lye the Islands of S. <hi>James</hi> in one of which they stayed, <hi>July</hi> 24. where they found store of Seals, Birds and such other provision as served their turns.

As they directed their course to <hi>Tidore,</hi> the Vice-Roy of the King of <hi>Terenate</hi> came boldly aboard them, intreating the General by all means to go to <hi>Terenate,</hi> assuring him that their King would be very glad of his coming, and ready to do for him what in reason he could require, whereas if he went to their enemies the <hi>Portugals</hi> in <hi>Tidore,</hi> he would have nothing to do with him. Upon these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions the General ran with <hi>Terenate,</hi> and presently sent a messenger to the King with a velvet Cloke, as a present, requiring nothing but Provisions in exchange for such things they wanted, and whereof he had store: the King sent back the Vice-Roy and some others of his Nobles to the General to signifie that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he came from so mighty a Princess, he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly entertain amity with her, and would reserve the Commodities and Traffique of his whole Island, to trade with her Subjects if they would embrace it. In token whereof he sent the General his Signet, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that himself with his Nobles would come to his ship, and bring her into a safer Harbour.</p>
               <p>Whilst they were delivering this errand the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals Messenger was come to the Court, and by the way was met by some Nobles, who conducted him to the Kings presence, to whom he delivered his Message, and Present. The King received it very graciously, and presently prepared himself to go in great State to the General, the rather to do Honour to our Queen from whom they came. The General received him answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Dignity: His Ordnance thundred, mixed with small shot, and his Trumpets and other Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments sounded to the great delight of the King and his company. He sent him also into his Canow such
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59780:20"/>
presents as he thought would be most acceptable, and work in him a confirmation of the Friendship already begun.</p>
               <p>The King as soon as he had brought their Ship to an Anchor, left them, promising to send them necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Victuals, and provision: and accordingly they had by way of traffique Rice, Hens, Sugar-canes, Plantanes, Cocos, and Meal: and some Cloves, and more they might have had if they had pleased. <hi>Novemb.</hi> 9. They departed, seeking out a place where they might trim their ship, and provide other necessaries; and <hi>Novemb.</hi> 14. They came to an Island uninhabited, where they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad 26 days. There they set up their tents, raised a fort for their goods, set up a Smiths forg, trimmed their ship, and dispatched their other businesses to their content, finding in the Island divers sorts of excellent provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so that in that space they grew lusty, strong, and healthful, and gained rare experience of Gods won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful wisdom in many strange, and admirable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that they saw there. It was full of wood, the trees large, &amp; streight, without boughs save only at the top: Amongst which every night they saw great swarms of fiery-worms flying in the air, whose bodies gave such a light as if every twig had been a lighted Candle, and the whole place the starry Sphear. Here also were store of Reer-mice as big, or bigger than Hens: and multitudes of Cray-fish where of one would satisfie four hungry men at dinner: they live always on the Land in holes like Cony-Berries.</p>
               <p>Being thus well furnished with all necessaries, <hi>Decem.</hi> 12. They put to Sea, and <hi>Decemb.</hi> 16. Had sight of the <hi>Celibes</hi> Islands, where, amongst those Islands they were entangled till, <hi>Jan.</hi> 9. at which time apprehending themselves past all danger, passing on with full Sails, in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59780:21"/>
the beginning of the night, their ship was laid fast up upon a desperate shoal,<note place="margin">Their great danger.</note> where was no probability of saving any thing, nor of escaping with life: and the more they looked about the less they hoped of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clear off it again. Hereupon they presently fell to prayer expecting nothing but present Death. Yet that they might not seem to tempt God by leaving any means unattempted that he afforded, presently after their Prayers were ended, the General (exhorting them to have the chiefest care of the better part, the soul, and adding many comfortable speeches of the life to come, which now alone they looked for) encouraged them all to bestir themselves shewing the way thereto by his own Example: And first of all the pump was well plyed, and the ship freed of water, whereby they found their Leakes to be nothing encreased, which, though it gave them no hopes of deliverance, yet it gave them some hope of respite, in as much as it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured them that the bulk was sound, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be the immediate providence of God alone, for that no strength of wood, and Iron could possibly have born so hard and violent a shock as their ship met with, dashing her self under full sail against the Rocks, except the extraordinary hand of God's had preserved the same.</p>
               <p>Their next assay was for good ground and Anchor-hold to Sea-ward of them (whereon to hale;) by which means, if by any, the General put them in comfort that there was yet some hope left to cleer themselves: He therefore in his own Person undertook the charge of sounding, which when he had done he found that even but a boats length from the ship, there was no bottom to be found by any length of Line whatsoever: So that the beginnings of hope which they were
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59780:21"/>
willing to have conceived before, were now quite dashed again. Yea, their misery seemed to be encreased, for that their expectation was now turned into awaiting for a lingring death, of the two, the far more fearful to be chosen. Yet one thing fell out happily, that the most of their men did not apprehend that danger, which if they had done, they would probably have been so much discouraged, that their sorrow would have disabled them from looking after a remedy. But the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and those few others, that could judge of the event wisely, dissembled the same, and gave encouraging speeches to the rest.</p>
               <p>For now it seemed a clear case, that whilst the ship lay so fast moored that she could not stir, either they were there to remain on the place with her, or else leaving her to commit themselves in a most poor, and helpless estate to seek some other place of refuge, the better of which choices carried with it the appearance of worse than a thousand Deaths. For as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ship this was the only comfort that she could give them, that lying there confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned already upon the hard and pinching Rocks, they could not but continually expect her spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ruine, as soon as the sea and winds should come to be the severe Executioners of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy judgment, by the appointment of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Judge already given upon her, who had bound her there, as with Adamantine chains to a most narrow prison, against their coming
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59780:22"/>
for that purpose: So that if they stay'd with her, they must perish with her: or if by any means yet undiscovered, any of them there should chance to be delivered, their escape must needs be a perpetual misery: It being far better to perish together, than with the loss of their friends to live in a strange Land: whether a solitary life (the better choice) amongst wilde Beasts (as Birds on the mountains without all comfort) or amongst the barbarous hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in intollerable bondage both of body and mind.</p>
               <p>But put the case that the day of the ships de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction should be deferred, longer than either reason could perswade or in any likelihood could seem possible (it being not in the power of any ship whatsoever to suffer what she had already endured) yet could their abode there profit them nothing, but encrease their wretchedness, and enlarge their sorrows. For as her Store and Victuals were not much (sufficient to sustain them only for some few days, without hope of having any new sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, no not so much as a cup of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) so must it inevitably come to pass, that they should be driven to eat the flesh of their own Arms; and how intollerable a thing this would have proved may easily be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>And if they had departed from her whither should they have gone to seek relief? Nay, the impossibility of going seemed to be no less than
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59780:22"/>
those other before mentioned. Their Boat was not able at once to carry above twenty Persons, and they were fifty eight in all: The nearest Land was eighteen miles from them, and the wind from the shoar directly beat against them; Or if they had thought of setting some a shoar, and then fetching the rest, there being no place thereabout without Inhabitants, the first that had Landed must first have faln into the hand of the Enemy,and so the rest in order as they came: And suppose they should escape the Sword, yet would their lives be worse than Death, not only in respect of their woful Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and bodily miseries; but most of all in respect of their Christian Liberty, being to be deprived of all publick means of serving the true God, and continually grieved with the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Impieties, and Devilish Idolatries of the Heathen.</p>
               <p>Their misery being thus manifest, the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration thereof must needs have caused trembling to flesh and blood, if Faith in Gods Promises had not mightily sustained them. The night they passed with earnest longings that the Day would appear: the time they spent in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Prayer, and other Godly Exercises, thereby comforting themselves and reviving their hearts: striving to bring themselves to an holy submission under the hand of God, and to refer themselves wholly to his good will, and pleasure.</p>
               <p>The Day at length appearing, and it being
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59780:23"/>
then almost ful-sea, after they had given thanks to God for his forbearing them so long, and had with tears called upon him to bless their labors, they again renewed their travel to see if now they could possibly find any Anchor-hold which they had formerly sought in vain. But this second attempt proved as fruitless as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and left them nothing to trust to but Prayers, and Tears, seeing it appeared now impossible that the prudence, policy,or power of man could ever effect the delivery of their ship, except the Lord miraculously should effect the same.</p>
               <p>Then was it motioned, and by general voice determined to commend and commit their case to God alone, leaving themselves wholly in his hand, to destroy or save them as it should seem best to his gracious wisdom: and that their Faith might be the better strengthned, and their comfortable apprehension of Gods mercy in Christ be more clearly felt, they had a Sermon Preach'd by their Minister, Master <hi>Fletcher,</hi> and the Sacrament of the Lords Supper administred to them.</p>
               <p>After which sweet repast, and other holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises adjoyning to it, ended, left they should in any respect seem guilty of neglecting of any lawful means that might conduce to their safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they resolved to lighten their Ship by cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth her Goods into the Sea, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in a very short time they dispatched with much alacrity. So that even those things
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59780:23"/>
which before they judged most necessary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering their condition, they now despised, neither sparing their Ammunition for defence, nor the Food for the sustentation of their lives, but every thing as it first came to hand went overboard, assuring themselves that if it pleased God to deliver them out of that desperate strait, he would both fight for them against their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and not suffer them to perish for want of Bread. But when they had done all they could, it was not their endeavour but Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand, and good Providence that wrought their deliverance. It was he alone that having brought them to the shaddow of Death,set them at liberty again, after they had remained in that desperate condition full 20 hours, for the magnifying of his Almighty power and mercy.</p>
               <p>The manner of their delivery was thus; The place where their Ship fate so fast was a firm Rock: the Ship struck on the Larboard side: at low water there was not above six foot depth in all, on the Starboard-side, and yet within a very little distance there was no bottom to be found. The Brieze during all the time that they were thus stayed, blew stifly against their broad side, and so kept the ship upright. But it pleased God in the beginning of the Tide; while the water was yet almost at the lowest, to slack the stiffness of the wind, and then their ship that required thirteen foot water to make her float, and had not at this time on one side
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59780:24"/>
about seven at most, wanting her prop on the other side, which had already too long kept her up,<note place="margin">A won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</note> fell a heeling towards the deep water, and by that means freed her Kneel, and made them all glad men.</p>
               <p>This, of all their other dangers in the whole Voyage was the greatest, yet not the last. For of a long season they could not free themselves, from the care and fear of those shallows: nor could they possibly come to any convenient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choring amongst them: But were continually tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed amongst those many Islands and Shoals of the <hi>Celibes,</hi> till the eighth day of the following month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jan.</hi> 12. Being not able to bear any Sails by reason of a Tempest, and fearing their many dangers, they let fall an Anchor upon a shoal. And <hi>Jan.</hi> 14. being got a little farther South, they again cast Anchor at an Island, where they spent a day in taking in water, and wood. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they met with foul weather, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous shoals for many days together, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned them to leave these coasts, and to bear for <hi>Timor,</hi> the most Southerly Cape of the <hi>Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes:</hi> Yet could they not so easily clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as they expected: So that <hi>Jan.</hi> 20. They were forced to run with a small Island not far from thence; and while they were with their Boat at a good distance searching for a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent place wherein to Anchor, they were sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly environed with no small extremities. For there arose a most violent, and intollerable
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59780:24"/>
flaw, and storm from the south-west against them, making them (who were on a Lee-shoar, amongst most dangerous Rocks, and Shelves) extreamly to fear, not only the loss of their Boat and Men; but of themselves, their Ship, and Goods: or the casting of those men whom God should spare amongst Infidels; which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery could not by any Power or Industry of theirs have been prevented, had not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent goodness of God (by staying the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious extremities wherewith they were environed) wrought their present deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: By whose unspeakable goodness, their Boat and men also, were unexpectedly brought to them in safety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>January,</hi> 26. With much adoe they gat clear from this place, yet the Winde turning strong against them, they could bear no sail to the end of that month. <hi>February</hi> the first, They saw a very high Land, and would faign have born to it to have got some succour, but they could find no safe Harbour. <hi>February</hi> the third, They saw a small Island, but being still unable to bear any sail, they were carried away by the storm, and were not able to fetch it. <hi>February</hi> the sixth, They came to another Island, where they cast Anchor, and furnished themselves with water and wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>February</hi> the eighth, Departing thence they spied two Canows coming towards them, which talked with them, and conducted them to their Town called <hi>Barativa.</hi> The People were
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59780:25"/>
Gentiles, of handsome Bodies, comely Stature, Civil demeanour, very just in their dealings, and courteous to strangers: were glad of their coming, and relieved their wants with what the Country could afford. Their Island is rich, and fruitful, having Gold, Silver, Copper, Tin, Sulpher, &amp;c. And they are very skilful in working these Mettals. Their Fruits are Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, Ginger, Long pepper, Limons, Cocos, with divers others, of each of which they had from them, whatsoever they desired for their need: Having here spent two days, they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very well refreshed.</p>
               <p>After this they passed within sight of many Islands, but they neither needed nor desired to visit them, only they took in some fresh water at one of them, where they found two Turtles. <hi>March</hi> the tenth, They came to an Anchor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a high Land where they took in water,<note place="margin">They come to <hi>Java</hi> Major.</note> and then sent their Boat to traffique with the Inhabitants: and the next day the General sent his man with a Present to the King of Cloth, both Linnen and Woollen, and some Silk, which he gladly accepted, and thankfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and returned Rice, Cocos, Hens, and other Victuals. This was the Isle of <hi>Java</hi>: And <hi>March,</hi> the thirteenth, The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral himself with his Gentlemen, and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers went a shoar, and Presented the King with his Musick (who entertained him joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully) and shewed him the manner of the use of their Arms, by training of his men before
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59780:25"/>
him: and so they were dismissed with a promise that more victuals should be sent them.</p>
               <p>In this Island there is one chief King and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him many petty Governors whom they call <hi>Raias,</hi> who live in great friendship one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. <hi>March,</hi> the fourteenth, They received more victuals from them, and the day after, three of these <hi>Raias</hi> came to see the General and his ship, and warlike Ammunition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were very much pleased: and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to the King, he went to see them himself carrying some victuals with him. The <hi>Raias</hi> came daily to them, whom the General enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Courteously: and one of them brought an Ox, for which the General requited him with some Silks. Here they trimmed and washed their Ship of which she had great need, being in this long Voyage overgrown with a kind of shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish which much hindred her sailing, They traded with this People for Hens, Goats, Cocos, Plantanes, and other things whereof they had great plenty.</p>

               <p>When they were gotten out, they took their course towards <hi>Spain.</hi> And when they came neer that Coast they spied divers Sails, whereupon the General sent some Pinnaces to see what they were; who upon the sight of them, abandoned most of their Ships (being <hi>French</hi> men laden with Salt.) Amongst them there was one so well liked, which had no man in her, as being brought to the General he made stay of her for
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59780:27"/>
their service, intending to pay for her, which he accordingly performed at his return, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her the <hi>Drake,</hi> the rest were dismissed in safety.</p>
               <p>The day following, standing in again with the shore they espied a tall ship of about two hundred and forty Tun, which was chased by the Leiutenant General in the <hi>Tyger,</hi> and when he had forced her to strike sail, upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion finding her to be a <hi>Spanish</hi> ship of Saint <hi>Sebastian,</hi> laden with <hi>Poor John</hi> from <hi>Newfound Land,</hi> they juged her to be lawful prize; and therefore distributed her lading amongst the Fleet, which afterwards stood them in good stead.</p>
               <p>A day or two after they put into the Isles of <hi>Bayon,</hi> where they had no sooner Anchored, but they manned forth all their Pinnaces with an intent to surpise the City, upon sight of whom the Governour and People were much amazed; there they landed, and quartered themselves to their best advantage: but in the night there arose such a storm, that they thought fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their ships, which they did with some difficulty, many of their ships being driven from their Anchors. The tempest continued three days, which scattered the Fleet, and the <hi>Speed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> was driven into <hi>England,</hi> the rest came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether again when the storm was ended.</p>
               <p>Then the Lieutenant General was sent to see what they might do about <hi>Vigo,</hi> where he took many Boats, and Carvels, divers being laden with
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59780:28"/>
houshold stuffe: and amongst other Church orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they found a great Crosse of Silver, of fair and embossed work, and double gilt, which was of good value. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> complained that here they lost goods worth above three thousand Duckats.

and to erect Saint <hi>George</hi>'s <hi>Cross</hi> upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Fortress that it might be seen by our Navy, which was done accordingly; And it being <hi>November</hi> the seventeenth, the day of our Queens coming to the Crown, they dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all the Ordnance, being about fifty Pieces which they found in the Town, ready mounted and charged, which also was answered by the Ordnance out of all our ships, which were now come near.</p>
               <p>Here they continued fourteen days taking such spoils as the place afforded, as Wine, Oyl, Meal, Vinegar, Olives, &amp;c. but found no trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure at all in it. This City is finely seated, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a River running by it, and a Valley full of Gardens and Orchards well replenished with Fruits, Hearbs, and Trees, as Lemons, Oranges, Sugar-canes, Coco's, Plantans, &amp;c. <hi>November</hi> the four and twentieth, the General, and Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General with six hundred men marched to St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> twelve miles within Land, which they found empty also,<note place="margin">Saint <hi>Domingo</hi> taken.</note> the Inhabitants being fled into the mountains, from whence they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to St. <hi>Jago</hi>: And <hi>November</hi> the six and twentieth, they embarked their Forces, and went to the <hi>Play,</hi> where they found two pieces of Ordnance hid in the ground, and so they burned the town, and departed.</p>

In eighteen days space they came within sight of Saint <hi>Dominica,</hi> inhabited by savage people that go all naked, and paint their bodies: These helped our men to fill &amp; carry fresh water from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver upon their bare shoulders to their Boats, &amp; brought them store of <hi>Tabacco,</hi> and Bread made of the <hi>Cassavy</hi> root, very white, and savory, for which they gave them some Glass Beads to their great content.</p>
               <p>From thence they went to S. <hi>Christophers</hi> Island, where they cleansed and aired their ships, &amp; refreshed their sick People: From hence they resolved to go to <hi>Hispaniola:</hi> and by the way they met with a small Frigat, bound for S. <hi>Domingo,</hi> the chiefest and ancientest City in that Island; and the men of her being exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, one assured them that the haven of it was a barred haven, the Shoar well fortified, so that there was no convenient landing within ten <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> miles of the City, whither this man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to conduct them.</p>

which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had manned, and planted their Ordnance without the gates, and some small shot in an ambush by the way side. The <hi>English</hi> being aboue twelve hundred men divided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: the Lieutenant General leading the one halfe to one gate, and Captain <hi>Powel</hi> the other halfe to the other gate, vowing that with God's assistance they would not rest till they met in the market place.</p>
               <p>No sooner had the <hi>Spaniards</hi> discharged their Ordnance, doing some litle execution, but the Lieutenant General hasted or rather ran upon them to prevent their charging again,<note place="margin">Saint <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their ambush, entred Pell Mell with them into the gate not staying till he came into the Market place, unto whom shortly after came Captain <hi>Powel</hi> with his Companies. This place they strengthened with Baricadoes, the City be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too large to be guarded by so small, and weary an Army. And after midnight, they in the Castle, hearing some of the <hi>English</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie about the Gate of it, quitted it, some being taken Prisoners, and others escaping by Boats.</p>
               <p>The next day the <hi>English</hi> enlarged their Quarters, and fortified themselves, and held the Town for a months space. During this time the General sent a <hi>Negro</hi> Boy with a Flag of Truce to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who by the way was met by some Officers of the Galley which the <hi>English</hi> had taken, together with the City, who furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously thrust the poor Boy thorow the Body, who

returning to the General, having declared how barbarously they had used him, fell down, and died in his presence. The General being much moved herewith, commanded the Provest Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, to take two Friers, and to carry them to the same place with a sufficient guard, and there to hang them; and withal he sent one of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners to inform the <hi>Spaniards</hi> why he did it, and to tell them that till the party who had thus murthered his messenger were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, there should no day pass wherein he would not hang two Prisoners till all were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the day following, the murtherer was brought, and an offer made to deliver him to the General, who yet thought it more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to make them perform the Execution themselves in the sight of the <hi>English,</hi> which was done accordingly.</p>
               <p>During their aboad here Commissioners oft passed between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> &amp; them about the ransome of the City, but not agreeing, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> spent every morning till the heat of the day, in firing, and destroying the houses in the outward part of the City, two hundred Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners being employed therein for divers days: Yet were the Houses built so magnificenlty, and strongly of stone, that they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume one third part of the Town all that time, whereupon the General was contented to accept of twenty five thousand Duckets,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:59780:30"/>Here our Soldiers met with good pillage, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of rich Apparel; but treasure they found none: For the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by their Cruelties had so destroyed the Natives, which used to work in the Mines of Gold and Silver, that they were wholly given over, and in that Island they were forced to use Copper Mony. Yet they found store of Wine, Oyl, Vineger Wheat, Meal, Woollen and Linnen Cloth, some Silks, &amp;c. which much relieved them: there was but little Plate found but good store of Porcellaws, or <hi>China</hi> Dishes: yet some Plate they found, and very costly houshold furniture.</p>
               <p>From Saint <hi>Domingo</hi> they put over towards the Main,<note place="margin">They come to <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena.</hi>
                  </note> and at last came within sight of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> who had notice of their coming twenty days before from <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> so that they were fully provided for them. The mouth of the Harbor lay about three miles Westward from the City, where they entred without opposition: and in the Evening some of them landed under the conduct of the Lieutenant General, who about midnight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their march towards the City, keeping close by the Sea-wash for their greater safety. When they came within two miles of the town, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one hundred of their Horse met them, but upon the first Volley of shot that was given them, they retreated.</p>
               <p>Coming within half a mile of the town, the way grew narrow between the Sea, and an Arm

of it, which was Fortified with a stone wall and ditch: the wall built with very good Flankers: there was only a little place left open which was made up with very good Baricadoes of Wine-pipes filled with Earth standing very close together. This place was furnished with six De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miculverins, and Sakers, which shot directly in Front upon them as they approached: They had brought also two great Gallies with their Prowes to the Shoar with eleven Pieces of Ordnance; which flanked their coming on: In those Gallies also were three or four hundred small shot placed: and on the Land to guard that narrow Pass three hundred shot, and Pikes.</p>
               <p>These spared not their shot either great or small; but the <hi>English,</hi> taking the advantage of the dark, still keeping the Sea-wash Shoar escaped all pretty well, themselves forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to shoot till they were come to the very Wall side, then running upon the Barricadoes, down went the Pipes of Earth, and after a Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of shot in their faces they came to it with Pikes and Swords, wherein they proved too hard for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and forced them to flee. Here the Lieutenant General with his own hands killed the chiefest Ensign Bearer of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who yet fought very stoutly. Then pursuing them, they entred <hi>Pell Mell</hi> with them into the Town and wan the Market-place,<note place="margin">

carried their Wives and Children.</p>
               <p>At every streets end they had made Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does and Trenches excellently well, and had placed many <hi>Indians</hi> in corners of advantage, with Arrows so impoisoned that if they did but break the skin the wounded party died: by these some of our men were slain: They had also stuck in the ground against the coming of the <hi>English</hi> abundance of sticks with sharp ends villainously impoisoned, most of which they yet escaped by keeping the Sea-wash-shoar.</p>
               <p>Here they stayed six weeks, the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named mortality continuing still amongst them, though not so violent as at first. This the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call a <hi>Galenture,</hi> which such as were touched with, if they escaped Death continued long very weak both in mind and body. This forced them to give over their intended enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise for <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> and so overland to <hi>Panama,</hi> where they should have met with store of treasure: and here they resolved to return home-ward.</p>
               <p>During their aboad in this place there passed divers courtesies between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and them; and the Governour of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> and the Bishop of it, with divers Gentlemen came to visit the General: Yet because they could not agree about ransoming the City, they burned the out-parts of it, and at last they agreed to give the General one hundred and ten thousand Duckets for the ransome of the rest, this being
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59780:32"/>
a far richer place than S. <hi>Domingo</hi>: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they gave him a thousand crowns to spare an Abby that stood a quarter of a mile from the town, and because they professed that they were not able to ransom the Castle, it was blown up with Gun-powder.

Pinnaces well man'd, &amp; marching up the River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, at last they saw a fort, newly built by the <hi>Spaniards</hi>: whereupon the Leiutenant General took four Companies, and marched towards it: and though he went as covertly as he could, yet the enemy took the Alarm, and thinking that the whole force of the <hi>English</hi> was coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, they discharged their Pieces, and ran away. Their flight was discovered to the <hi>English</hi> by a <hi>French</hi> man, who had been a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner with them, whereupon the General him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with many others went to the place, and found it empty. On the Platform they found thirteen or fourteen pieces of Brass Ordnance, and a chest having in it about two thousand pound <hi>Sterling,</hi> lately sent from the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s treasurer to pay the Souldiers of that place.</p>
               <p>From hence they went to their town about a mile off, standing upon the River of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and when they landed, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made some few shot at them, and ran away.

the <hi>English</hi> ships got out of the Harbor, they steered by towards <hi>Calis,</hi> which the <hi>English</hi> willingly suffered them to do, that they might the more commodiously chase them in the Reer with a fore-right Wind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> the one and twentieth, Our Lord Admiral sent before him a Pinnace, called the <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> to denounce War by discharging her Ordnance, and himself following in the <hi>Ark-Royal,</hi> set upon the <hi>Spanish</hi> Admiral (as he thought) though it proved to be the ship of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonzo de Levas,</hi> where fire, smoke, and Lowd thundring Cannons began the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley: and rending Bullets (freely interchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) were the fiery messengers of each others minds.</p>
               <p>Soon after came up <hi>Drake, Haukins,</hi> and <hi>Forbusher,</hi> incessantly playing with their Ordnance upon the hind most Squadron of the Enemies which was Commanded by <hi>Recalde,</hi> whose Ship was soon so battered as that it was made unserviceable, and thereupon was with much difficulty drawn into the main Fleet.</p>
               <p>In this medly, a great Gallion, wherein was <hi>Don Pedro de Valdez,</hi> and some other Noblemen being sore battered by the <hi>English</hi> shot, to avoid the same, fell foul upon another ship, whereby her fore-mast was broken off, and she made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to follow the rest of the Fleet.

fearing to loose sight of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> passed by her, and followed the Lanthorn, which he supposed to be carried by Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> as was agreed. But this brave Kinght was eagerly pursuing five great Hulks which he judged to be <hi>Spaniards</hi>; yet when he haled them they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be <hi>Easterlings,</hi> and friends, and so were dismissed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> the two and twentieth, Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> espied the aforementioned lagging Gallion, whereupon he sent forth a Pinnace commanding them to yield, otherwise his Bullets, without any delay, should force them to it: <hi>Valdez,</hi> to seem valorous, answered, <hi>that they were four hundred and fifty strong: that himself was</hi> Don Pedro, <hi>and stood upon his Honour, and therefore propounded certain conditions: Drake</hi> replyed, that he had no leasure to Parley. If he would immediately yield, well and good: If not, he should soon find that <hi>Drake</hi> was no dastard. <hi>Pedro</hi> hearing that it was the fiery <hi>Drake</hi> (whose very name was dreadful to the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) that had him in close, presently yielded, and with forty of his Companions, came aboard Sir <hi>Francis</hi> his ship; where, first giving him the <hi>Conge,</hi> he Protested that he and all his, were resolved to have died fighting, had they not faln into such Noble hands, whose valour and felicity was so great, that <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Neptune</hi> seemed to wait on him in all his enterprises, and whose Noble, and generous mind towards the vanquished, had often been experienced even of his greatest

               <p>But Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi>'s men paid themselves well by the Plunder of the ship, wherein they found fifty thousand Duckets of Gold, which they merrily shared amongst them. <hi>July</hi> the three and twentieth, was the greatest fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two Fleets: And <hi>July</hi> the four and twentieth, the <hi>English</hi> Fleet was divided into four Squadrons, whereof the Lord Admiral in the <hi>Ark-Royal,</hi> led the first: Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> in the <hi>Revenge</hi> led the second: Captain <hi>Hawkins</hi> the third: And Captain <hi>Forbusher</hi> the fourth.

This Island yields store of <hi>Wine Wheat,</hi> and other <hi>Grain; Conies, Partridges &amp;c.</hi> From thence, passing towards the <hi>West Indies,</hi> they saild by the <hi>Island</hi> called <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino,</hi> inhabited by Barbarous People called <hi>Canibals</hi>: From thence to <hi>Dominica</hi> where they had store of Tobacco for Hatchets and Knives, &amp;c. <hi>November</hi> the twelvth, they cast anchor against a great Fort, within three or four miles of <hi>Porte-Richo,</hi> from whence they were plyed with great shot. Here died that brave Sea Captain, Sir <hi>John Hawkins,</hi> to the great grief of all the rest.</p>
               <p>The same day also Sir <hi>Nicholas Clifford,</hi> Captain <hi>Stratford,</hi> and Captain <hi>Brown</hi> were wounded with a great piece of Ordinance, as they sat at Supper with Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> whose stool also was struck from under him, as he was drinking a Cup of Beer; yet, by Gods Providence he, and all the rest escaped. And
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59780:37"/>
that night Sir <hi>Nicholas Clifford</hi> died of that wound: and Captain <hi>Brute Brown,</hi> a day or two after. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had barred up the Harbor by sinking a great Ship therein, from which they had drawn long masts on both sides to the <hi>Forts,</hi> which defended the Passage: within which were there five <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships, filled with Muski<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and stored with Ordnance; yet Captain <hi>Baskerville,</hi> putting his men into boats, &amp; Pin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naces, attempted to enter by force, &amp; fir'd one or two of those Ships, but with a shower of small shot was beaten back, with the loss of many of his men.</p>
               <p>From hence sailing to the Continent they burnt <hi>Rio de la Haak,</hi> the inhabitants wherof offered thirty four thousand Ducats to redeem the same, but over prising the Pearls they brought, it was refused; they also burnt down some other Villages thereabout. Here in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious House they found some treasure, Pearl and Marchandize, which they carried away. In this Country was great store of <hi>Beeves, Goats, Sheep, Horses, Asses &amp;c,</hi> and also Store of <hi>Fowl,</hi> as <hi>Pellicans, Red Sea Fowls,</hi> like unto <hi>Crane.</hi>

                  <hi>December</hi> the nineteenth, They came to <hi>Santa Martha,</hi> out of which all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were fled: But the English following them into the Woods, found some treasure, and other things of some value; when they depar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted

               <p>On Munday after Sir <hi>Thomas Baskervile</hi> with six hundred men began their journey by Land towards <hi>Panama,</hi> hoping there to furnish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Treasure:<note place="margin">They march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>January</hi> the tenth they came to <hi>Scoday,</hi> and took a <hi>Spanish</hi> Frigate that was sent to give In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of their being upon the Coast, but
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59780:38"/>
found nothing of worth in her. Then the General caused his sick men to be carried a shoar and to have the best comfort they were able to give them: Also there they built four Pinnaces, and took in fresh water. Here were great store of Wild-beasts in this Island but no Inhabitants.</p>
