            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Be pleased then, most honoured Sir, to give mee leave to tell you, that your eminencie of place did somwhat induce me, both now and before, to make choise of you for its Patron, but your endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with grace did invite me to it, God having bestowed upon you speciall <hi>spirituall blessings in heavenly things in Christ:</hi> for it hath beene declared unto me by them that knew you, when you were but a youth, how Christ met with you then, and by sending his spirit into your heart, first convinced you of sin, as was manifest by those conflicts which your soule then had, both with Satan and it selfe, whilst you did not believe in Christ. Secondly, of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, as was manifest by the peace and comfort which you afterwards had, by believing that Christ was gon to the Father and appeared in his presence as your Advocate and surety that had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for you.

in that you have been <hi>carefull with the true godly man, Psal. 112.5.</hi> to guide your affairs with judgement, in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the minde of Christ.</p>
            <p>I have not forgotten what desires you have expressed to know the true diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally to be acquainted with the Doctrine of free grace, the mysteries of Christ, and the life of faith.

And truly, Sir, I am confident, the more they grow &amp; flourish in any mans heart, the more will all heart corruptions wither and decay. Oh! Sir, If the truth contained in this Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, were but as much in my heart, as they are in my head; I were a happie man, for then should I bee more free from pride, vain glory, wrath, anger, self-love, and love of the world then I am, and then should I have more humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, meeknesse, and love both to God and man then I have, oh! then should I bee content with Christ alone, and live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the things in the world, then should I experimentally know, both how to abound and how to want, and then shall I be fit for any condition, nothing could come amisse unto me, oh! that the Lord would be pleased to write it in our hearts by his blessed Spirit.</p>

            <p>And yet, alas, there is no point in all practicall Divinity, that wee are naturally so much averse and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward unto as unto this; neyther doth Sathan strive to hinder us so much from doing any thing else as this: And hence it is, that we are all of us naturally apt to abide and continue, in that sinfull and miserable estate, that the first <hi>Adam</hi> plunged us into without eyther taking any notice of it, or being at all affected with it, so far are wee from comming out of it. And if the Lord be pleased by any means to open our eyes, to see our misery, and we doe thereupon begin to step out of it, yet, alas, wee are prone rather to goe backwards to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards the first <hi>Adams</hi> pure estate, in

striving and strugling to leave sinne, and performe duties, and doe good works, hoping thereby to make our selves so righteous and holy, that God will let us into Paradise againe to eat of the tree of life and live for ever, and this we do untill we see the <hi>flaming sword at</hi> Edens <hi>gate,</hi>

And is there not at hand some ignorant, miserable comforter ready to say, yet doe not despayre man, but repent of your sins, and aske God forgivenesse, and reforme your life, and doubt not, but he will be mercifull unto you, for hee hath promised (you know) <hi>that at what time soever a sinner repenteth of his sins hee will forgive him.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60509:7"/>And doth hee not hereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort himself, and say in his heart at least, ô, if the Lord will but spare my life, and lengthen out my days, I will become a new man! I am very sorry that I have lived such a sinfull life, but I will never doe as I have done for all the world: ô, you shall see a great change in me! <hi>believe it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hereupon he betakes himself to a new course of life, and it may be becomes a zealous professour of Religion, performing all Christian exercises both publike and private, and leaves off his old companions, and keeps company with religious men, (and so it may be goes on till his dying day, and thinks himselfe sure of Heaven and eternall happines) &amp; yet it maybe all this while is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Christ and his Righteousnes, and therefore establisheth his own.</p>
            <p>Where is the man, or where is the woman that is truly come to Christ, that hath not had some experience in themselves of such a disposition as this, if there be any that have refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med


<pb facs="tcp:60509:7"/>
their lives, and are become Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours of Religion, and have not taken notice of this in themselves more or lesse: I wish they have gone beyond a legall Professour, or one still under the covenant of works.</p>
            <p>Nay, where is the man or woman that is truly in Christ, that findeth not in themselves an aptnes to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their hearts from Christ, and to put some confidence in their owne works and doings; if there be any that do not find it: I wish their hearts deceive them not.</p>
            <p>Let me confesse ingeniously, I was a professour of Religion, at least a dozen yeeres, before I knew any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to eternall life, then to be sorry for my sins, and aske forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and strive and endeavour to fulfill the Law, and keepe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, according as Master <hi>Dod</hi> and other godly men had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded them: and truly I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I was in hope I should at last at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the perfect fulfilling of them, and in the mean-time, I conceived,


<pb facs="tcp:60509:8"/>
that God would accept the will for the deed, or what I could not doe Christ had done for me.</p>
            <p>And though at last by meanes of conferring with Master <hi>Thomas Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> in private, the Lord was pleased to convince me, that I was yet but a proud Pharisee, and to shew mee the way of faith and salvation by Christ alone, and to give mee (as I hope) a heart in some measure to embrace it; yet, alas, through the weaknesse of my faith, I have been and am still apt to turne aside to the covenant of works, and therefore have not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to that joy and peace in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, nor that measure of love to Christ and man for Christs sake, as I am confident, many of Gods Saints do attain unto in the time of this life, the Lord be mercifull unto mee, and increase my faith.</p>
            <p>And are there not other (though I hope) but few who being enlightned to see their misery, by reason of the guilt of sin, though not by reason of the filth of sinne: And hearing of


<pb facs="tcp:60509:8"/>
justification freely by grace through the redemption which is in Jesus Christ, do applaud and magnifie that doctrine, following them that doe most preach and presse the same, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to be (as it were) ravished with the hearing thereof, out of a conceit that they are by Christ freely justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from the guilt of sin, though still they retain the filth of sin, these are they that content themselves (with a Gospel knowledge, with meere no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the head but not in the heart, glorying and rejoycing in free grace, and justification by faith alone, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing faith in Christ, and yet are not possessed of Christ, these are they that can talke like believers, and yet do not walke like believers; these are they that have language like Saints, and yet have conversations like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils: these are they that are not obedient to the Law of Christ, and therefore are justly called <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now both these paths leading from Christ, have been justly judged as


<pb facs="tcp:60509:9"/>
erronious, and to my knowledge, not onely a matter of 18 or 20 years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, but also within these three or foure years, there hath been much a doe, both by preaching, writing, and disputing, both to reduce men out of them, and to keep them from them, and hot contentious have been on both sides, and all, I fear me, to little purpose, for hath not the strict professour according to the Law, whilst he hath striven to reduce the loose professour, according to the Gospel, out of the <hi>Antinomian</hi> path, intangled both himselfe and others, the faster in the yoke of bondage,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1.</note> and hath not the loose professour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Gospel, whilst he hath striven to reduce the strict professour according to the Law, out of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall path, <hi>by promising liberty from the Law,</hi>

            <p>For this cause I, though I be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, have, by the grace of God, endeavoured in this Dialogue, to walk, as a middle-man betwixt them


<pb facs="tcp:60509:9"/>
both, in shewing to each of them his erronious path, with the middle path (which is Jesus Christ received truly, and walked in answerably, as a means to bring them both unto him, and make them both one in him: And oh! that the Lord would be pleased so to blesse it to them, that it might be a means to produce that effect.</p>

            <p>IF thou wilt please to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use this little Book, thou shalt finde great worth in it: There is a line of a gracious Spirit drawne through it, which hath fastned many precious truths together, and presented them to thy view, according to the variety of mens spirits, the various ways of presenting known truths are profitable. The


<pb facs="tcp:60509:11"/>
grace of God hath helped this Author in his worke, if it, in like manner, helps thee in reading, thou shalt have cause to blesse God for these truths thus brought to thee, and for the labours of this good man, whose ends, I believe, are very syncere for God and thy good.</p>

            <p>OCcasionally lighting upon this Dialogue, under the Approbation of a learned and judicious Divine, I was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by induced to read it, and afterwards upon serious consideration of the usefulnesse of it, to commend it to the people in my publike Ministry.</p>
            <p>Two things in it especially tooke with me: first the matter, the main substance being distinctly to discover the nature of the two Covenants, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which all the mysteries both of Law and Gospel depend. To see the first <hi>Adam</hi> to be <hi>primus foederatus,</hi> in the one, and the second <hi>Adam</hi> in the other, to distinguish rightly betwixt the law standing alone as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and standing in subordination to the Gospel, as a servant, this I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure my selfe to be the key which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens


<pb facs="tcp:60509:12"/>
the hiden treasures of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Portis apertis paradisum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trasse, Tom.</hi> 1.</note>As soone as God had given <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> but a glimpse hereof, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that hee seemed to bee brought into Paradise again; and the whole face of the Scripture to bee changed to him: and he looked upon every truth with another eye.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the manner, because it is an <hi>Irenicum,</hi> and tends to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation and a right understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Times of Reformation have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been times of division, Satan will cast out a floud after the woman, as knowing that more die by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement of the humours of their own bodies, than by the sword, and that if men be once engaged, they will contend; if not for truth, yet for victory.</p>
            <p>Now if the difference be in things of lesser consequence, the best way to quench it were silence, this was <hi>Luthers</hi> counsell given in an Epistle written to the Divines assembled in a Synod at <hi>Norimberge, Meum consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium


<pb facs="tcp:60509:12"/>
fuerit (cum nullum sit Ecclesiae periculum) ut hanc causam sinatis, vel ad tempus sopitam, (utinam extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam) jacere donec tutiore &amp; meliore tempore, animis in pace firmatis; &amp; charitate aduatis, eam disputetis.</hi> I think it were good counsell concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many of the Disputes of our times.</p>
            <p>But if the difference be of greater concernment as this is, then the way to decide it, is to bring in more light which this Authour hath done, with much evidence of Scripture, backt with the authority of most moderne Divines: so that whosoever desires to have his judgement cleered in the maine controversie, betweene us and the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> with a small ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence either of money or time, hee may here receive ample satisfaction; this I testifie upon request, professing my selfe a friend both to truth and peace.</p>

               <p>The reason why I rather chuse to call the Law of the Ten Commandements the matter of the Covenant of works,

then the Covenant it self, is because I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the matter of it cannot properly be called the covenant of works, except the form be put upon it, that is to say, except the Lord require, and man undertake to yield perfect obedience thereunto, upon condition of eternall life and death: And therefore till then it was not a covenant of works betwixt God and all mankinde in</p>

And when they were come to mount Sinai, the Lord delivered the Ten Commandements unto them.</p>

not to be justified; even so was there amongst the Jews.

And to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond sort it was of use, to shew them what was good, and what was evill, and to be as a bridle to them to restraine them from evill, and as a motive to move them to good, for fear of punishment, or hope of reward in this life; which though it was but a forced and constrained obedience,<note place="margin">

So the people of the Old Testament being neerest to <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant and Paradise, were most prone to such conceits. And secondly, because the Covenant of Grace, and Celestiall paradise, were but little mentioned in the Old Testament, they, for the most part, had but a glimmering knowledge of them, and so could not yield obedience freely, as sonnes: therefore the Lord saw it meet to move them to yield obedience to his lawes, by their own motives, and as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants or children under age.</p>

               <p>I know right well that in our last Translation the words are so rendred, but godly and learned <hi>Tindall</hi> renders it thus, <hi>Remember yee not bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that the Law hath dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a man as long as it endureth,</hi> and B. <hi>Hall,</hi> paraphraseth upon it thus, <hi>Know yee not brethren that the Mosaicall Law hath dominion over a man that is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto it, so long as the said Law is in force:</hi> So likewise, <hi>Origen, Ambrose,</hi> and <hi>Erasmus</hi> doe all agree,<note place="margin">Alledged by Doctor <hi>Willet</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi>

               <p>Death is nothing else but a dissolution, or an untying of a compound, or a separation between matter and forme; and therefore, when the soule and body of man is separated, wee say hee is dead, so that by this double death, wee are to

               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>Truly the opposition betwixt the <hi>Jews</hi> Covenant of Grace and ours, was chiefly of their owne making, they should have been driven to Christ by the Law,<note place="margin">

               <p>And truly, Sir, it is no great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, though they in this point did so much erre and mistake, who had the Covenant of Grace made known to them so darkly, when many amongst us who have it more cleerly manifest, do the like.</p>

               <p>And truly, it is no marvell, though all men naturally do so for man naturally doth apprehend God to be the great master of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and himselfe to be his servant, and that therefore he must do his work before hee can have his wages, and the more work he doth, the better wages he shall have. And hence it it was, that when <hi>Aristotle</hi> came to speak of blessednes, &amp; to pitch upon the next means to that end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he said it was operation &amp; working, with whom also agreeth <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60509:61"/>
and let us not marvell that these men did so erre who never heard of Christ, nor of the Covenant of grace, when those to whom it was made known by the Apostles of Christ did the like, witnesse those to whom the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epistles, and especially the <hi>Galathians,</hi> for although hee had by his preaching when he was present with them, made known unto them the doctrine of the Covenant of grace, yet after his departure, through the seducement of false teachers, they were soon turned to the Covenant of works, and sought to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified either in whole or in part by it, as you may see if you doe seriously consider that Epistle, (nay, what sayth <hi>Luther</hi>) it is, sayth he, the generall opinion of mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son throughout the whole world, That righteousnesse is gotten by the works of the Law, and the reason is, because the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works was ingendred in the mindes of men in the very creation, so that man, naturally can judge no otherwise of the law then as of a Covenant of works, which was given to make righteous, and to give life and salvation, this pernitious opinion of the Law, that it justifieth and maketh righteous before God (sayth <hi>Luther</hi> again) is so deeply rooted in mans reason,<note place="margin">On <hi>Gal. p.</hi> 133.</note> and all

I have not served God with all my heart, and therefore I see I must either goe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or else I shall never be happie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I set about the keeping of the Law in good earnest, and laboured to performe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not onely outwardly, but also inwardly from my heart, I heard, and read, and praid, and laboured to bring my heart, and force my soule to every duty, I called upon the Lord in good earnest, and told him that whatsoever hee would have mee to doe, I would doe it with all my heart, if hee would but save my soule, and then I also tooke notice of the inward corruptions of my heart, the which I had not formerly done, and was carefull to govern my

went to a third Minister of Gods holy word, and told him how the case stood with mee: and what I thought of my state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he cheered me up, bidding mee be of good comfort, for howsoever my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience since my Conversion, would not satisfie for my former sinnes, yet in as much as at my Conversion I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lamented, deplored, bewayled and forsaken them: God according to his rich mercy and gracious promise had mercifully pardoned and forgiving them. Then I returned home to my house againe, and went to God by earnest Prayer and supplication, and besought him to give mee assurance of the pardon and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my guiltinesse of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne, and all my actuall transgressions before my Conversion: and as I had endeavoured my self to be a good servant before, so I would still continue in doing my duty most exactly: and so being assured that the Lord had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this my request, I fell to my businesse, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my promise; I heard, I read, I prayed, <hi>I</hi> fasted, <hi>I</hi> mourned, <hi>I</hi> sighed and groned, and watched over my heart, my tongue, and wayes, in all my doings, actions, and dealings both with God and man: But after a while I growing

better acquainted with the spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Law, and with inward corruptions of mine owne heart, I perceived that I had deceived my selfe in thinking that I had kept the Law perfectly, for doe what I could I found many imperfections in my obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; for I had been and was still sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to sleepinesse, drousinesse, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinesse in prayer and hearing, and so in other duties, I failed in the manner of performance of them, and in the end why I performed them, seeking my selfe in every thing I did, and my conscience told me I failed in my duty to God in this, and in my duty to my neighbour in that, and then I was much troubled again, for I considered that the Law of God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and is not satisfied without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and perfect obedience, and then I went to the same Minister again, and told him how I had purposed, promised, striven and endeavoured, as much as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly I could to keepe the Law of Ged perfectly, and yet by wofull experience I had found, that I had and did still trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse it many ways, and therefore I feared hell and damation.</p>
               <p>O! but sayd hee, doe not feare, for

the best Christians have their failings, and no man keepeth the Law of God perfectly, and therefore goe on and doe as you have done in striving to keepe the Law perfectly, in what you cannot doe God will accept the will for the deed, and wherein you come short, Christ will help you out, and this satisfied and contented mee very much, so I returned home againe and fell to prayer, and told the Lord that now I saw I could not yield a perfect obedience to his Law, and yet I would not despaire, because I did believe, that what I could not doe Christ would doe for mee, and then I did cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude, that I was a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian indeede, and not before, and so have I beene perswaded ever since, And thus, Sir, you see I have dcclared unto you, both how it hath been wieh mee formerly, and how it is with me for the present, wherefore I would intreat you to tell me plainly and truly what you think of my condition.</p>

Now, sayth he, both these sorts offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law, the one on the right hand, who would be justified by the Law, and the other on the left hand, who would be clean delivered from the Law: Now I suppose this saying of <hi>Luthers,</hi> may bee fitly applyed to you two, for it appears to me, friend <hi>Antinomista</hi> that you have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended on the left hand, in not walking according to the matter of the Law, and it is evident to mee neighbour <hi>Nomista,</hi> that you have offended on the right hand, in seeking to be justified by your obedience to it.</p>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60509:73"/>
is to say, whereas you have endeavoured to travail towards heaven by the way of the Covenant of works, and so have gone a wrong way, you must goe quite back again all the way you have gone, before you can tread one step in the right way. And whereas you have attempted to build up the ruines of old <hi>Adam,</hi> and that upon your selfe, and so like a foolish builder to build a tottering house upon the sands, you must throw down and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molish all that building, and not leave a stone upon a stone, before you can begin to build anew, and whereas you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that there is a sufficiencie in your selfe to justifie and save your selfe, you must conclude that in that case, there is not onely in you an insufficiencie, but also a non-sufficiencie, yea, and that suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie that seemed to be in you, to bee your losse, in plain termes, you must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny your selfe, as our Saviour sayth, <hi>Matthew</hi> 16.24.

               <p>Why then, Sir, it seems you hold that the vilest sinner in the world ought not to be discouraged from believing in Christ, because of his sins.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Surely if Christ came into the world to seek, and call, and save sinners, and to justifie the ungodly, as you have heard, and if the more sinfull, miserable and distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a man doth judge himself to be, the more willing Christ is to receive him, and relieve him: then I see no reason why the vilest sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner should be discouraged from believing on the name of Christ because of his sins, nay, let me say more, the greater any mans sins are eyther in number or nature: the more hast hee should make to come unto Christ, and to say with <hi>David, for thy name sake,</hi>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60509:83"/>
comming unto Christ by believing on his name, as he is, for if the greatnesse of his sins should be so far from hindring his coming to Christ, that they should further it, then I know not what should hinder him.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>You speak very truly indeed, and therefore, I beseech you, Neighbour <hi>Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phytus,</hi> consider seriously of it, and let nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Satan the accuser of the brethren, nor your own accusing conscience joyning with him, hinder you any longer from Christ: for, what though they should accuse you of pride, infidelity, coveteousnesse, lust, anger, envie and hypocrisie; yea, what though they should accuse you of whoredome, theft and drunkennesse, and many the like, yet doe what they can, they can make no worse a man of you then a sinner, or the chiefe of sinners, or an ungodly person, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently such a one as Christ came to justifie and save, so that in very deed, if you rightly consider it, they doe you more good then hurt hereby, and therefore I beseech you, in all such cases, or conflicts, take the counsell of <hi>Luther,</hi> who saith, when thy conscience is throughly affraid with the remembrance of thy sins past, and the Devill assayleth thee with great violence, going about to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme thee, with heaps, floods, and whole seas of sins, to terrifie thee and to draw thee

               <p>But Sir, as I conceive, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture holds forth that the Lord hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted repentance to goe before faith, for is it not said, <hi>Marke</hi> 1.15. <hi>Repent ye, and believe the Gospel.</hi>

               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, indeed, though I hold not that evangelical repentance is an antecedent of faith in Christ, yet I hold it is a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, though I hold not that it goes before faith, yet I hold that it follows after.</p>

               <p>Yea, indeed, I doe conceive that ordinarily, and in some measure they do.</p>

               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>No, indeed, for some doubtlesse are like unto <hi>Zachous</hi> and <hi>Lydia,</hi> who received Christ,<note place="margin">Luke 19.6. Acts 16.14.</note> and were received of him (as it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thought) without any measure of them.</p>

               <p>O no, there is a great difference in the measure, for some do but as it were sip of the cup, and others doe as it were drinke the very dregs; whereby wee may perceive, that though it be necessary that these Legall fits of feare and terrour be in some before their comming to Christ: yet is there no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute necessity of them on Christs part, wherefore I pray take notice that those who have them, have them not because Christ would not bid them welcome, and receive them without them, but because they will not come to Christ, except they be by this means driven unto him.</p>

               <p>For the true and cleer under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of this point, you are to consider that when Jesus Christ the second <hi>Adam,</hi> had in the behalfe of all his chosen perfectly fulfilled the Law, as it is the covenant of works, divine justice delivered that bond in to Christ,<note place="margin">Col. 2.14.</note> who <hi>utterly cancelled that hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing,</hi> so that none of his chosen were to have any more to doe with it, nor it with them and now you by your believing in Christ having manifested,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.4.</note> 
                  <hi>that you are one that was chosen in him before the foundation of the world:</hi> his fulfilling of that covenant and cancelling of it, is imputed to you, and


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60509:88"/>
so you are acquitted and absolved from all your transgressions against that covenant, either past, present, or to come, and so you are justified as the Apostle saith,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.24.</note>

               <p>But, Sir, you know, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, <hi>It is God that justifieth,</hi> and God is eternall, and as you have shewed, Christ may be said to have fulfilled the covenant of works from all eternity, and if he bee Christs now, then was he Christs from all eternity, and therefore, as I conceive, hee was justified from all eternity.</p>

               <p>Indeed God is from all eternity, and in respect of Gods accepting of Christs undertaking to fulfill the covenant of works, he fulfilled it from all eternity, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Gods electing of him, he was Christs from all eternity,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>By him, all that believe are justified,</hi> so that in the act of justifying, faith and Christ, must have a mutuall relation, and must always concur and meet together, faith as the action which apprehendeth, and Christ as the object which is apprehended,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Iohn Fox</hi> upon election.</note> for neither doth Christ justifie without faith, neither doth faith except it bee in Christ.</p>

               <p>But yet, Sir, as I remember both <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> doe speake; as though a believer were so quite freed from the law by Christ, as that hee need not make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science at all of yielding obedience to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>I know right well that <hi>Luther</hi> sayth, the conscience hath nothing to doe with the law or works;<note place="margin">On <hi>Gal. p.</hi> 59.</note> and that <hi>Calvin</hi> sayth, the consciences of the faithfull, when the affiance of their justification before God is to be sought, must rayse and advance themselves above the Law;<note place="margin">Institut. <hi>p.</hi> 403.</note> and forget the whole righteousnes of the Law, and lay aside all thinking upon works. Now for the true understanding of these two worthy servants of Christ, two things are to be concluded: First, that when they speak thus of the law, it is evident they mean only in the case of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification; secondly, that when the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath to doe with the law in the case of


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60509:96"/>
justification it hath to doe with it onely as it is the covenant of works, for as the law is the Law of Christ, it neither justifies nor condemns, and so if you understand it of the Law, as it is the Covenant of works, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their meaning, then it is most true that they say, for why should a man let the Law come into his conscience, that is, why should a man make any conscience of doing the Law, to be justified thereby, considering it is a thing impossible, nay, what need hath a man to make co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science of doing the law to be justified thereby, when he knows he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready justified another way, nay, what need hath a man to make conscience of doing that law that is dead to him, and hee to it: hath a woman any need to make any conscience of doing her duty to her husband when hee is dead, nay, when shee her selfe is dead also, or hath a debter any need to make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of paying that debt which is already fully discharged by his surety, will any man be afraid of that obligation which is made void, the seale torne off,<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10.1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>could have made the commers thereunto perfect, and have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the worshippers, then should they have had


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60509:97"/>
no more conscience of sins,</hi> that is, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science would not have accused them of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of sins, now the blond of Christ hath purged the conscience of a believer from all his sins,<note place="margin">Chap. 9.14.</note> as they are transgressions against the covenant of works, and therefore what needs his conscience be troubled about that covenant, but now I pray you observe and take notice, that although <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> doe thus exempt a believer from the Law in the case of justification, and as it is the law or covenant of works, yet doe they not so out of the case of justification, and as it is the Law of Christ.</p>
               <p>For thus saith <hi>Luther,</hi> out of the matter of justification,<note place="margin">On <hi>Gal. p.</hi> 182.</note> wee ought with <hi>Paul, to thinke reverently of the Law, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it highly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.12, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>to call it holy, righteous, just, good, spirituall and divine</hi>; yea, out of the case of justification we ought to make a God of it: And in another place, saith he, there is a civill righteousnesse and a ceremoniall righteousnesse,<note place="margin">On <hi>Gal. p.</hi> 5.</note> yea, and besides these, there is another righteousnesse, which is the righteousnesse of the Law, or of the ten commrndements, which <hi>Moses</hi> teacheth, this also we teach after the doctrine of faith. And in a third place, he having shewed that believers through Christ are far above the Law (adds) howbeit,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chos.</hi> Sermon, <hi>pag.</hi> 103.</note> I will not deny but


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60509:97"/>
that <hi>Moses</hi> sheweth to them their duties, in which respect they are to be admonished and urged, wherefore such doctrines and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, ought to be among Christians, as it is certain there was among the Apostles, whereby every man may be admonished of his estate and office.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Calvin</hi> having said (as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that Christians in the case of justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, must raise and advance themselves above the law, (adds) neither can any man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by gather, that the law is superfluous to the faithfull, whom notwithstanding it doth not cease to teach, exhort, and prick forward to goodnesse, although before Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seat it hath no place in their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

Now this is most certaine, that


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60509:98"/>
the ten commandements doe no way worke transgression, anger, curse &amp; death; but onely as they are the covenant of works, neither hath Christ delivered believers, any otherwise from them then as they are the covenant of works, and therfore wee may assuredly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that they are no otherwise abrogated then as they are the covenant of works: Neither did <hi>Musculus</hi> intend any otherwise, for, sayth he, in the words following it must not be understood, that the points of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Moses</hi> covenant, are utterly brought to nothing, God forbid, for a Christian man is not at liberty to do those things that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and wicked, and if the doing of those things which the law forbids do not displease Christ, if they be not much different yea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if they be not repugnant to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness which we received of him: let it be lawful for a christian man to do them, or else not, but a Christian man doing against those things which be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> doth sinne more outragiously, then hee that should so do being under the law, so far off is he from being free from those things that be there commanded: Wherfore friend <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mista,</hi> if eyther you or any man else, shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of your being in Christ, exempt yourselves fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being under the law of the ten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, as they are the law of Christ,

I tel you truly, it is a shrewd signe you are not yet in Christ, for if you were, then Christ were in you, &amp; if Christ were in you then would he governe you, and you would be subject unto him; I am sure, the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> tels us,<note place="margin">Isai. 33.22.</note>

I say if any man pitch upon the signe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the thing signified by the signe, that is, if he pitch upon his graces (or gifts rather) and duties, and conclude assurance from them, as they are in him and come from him without having reference to Jesus Christ as the root and fountain of them, then are they deceitfull markes and signes, but if he looke upon them with reference to Jesus Christ, then are they not deceitfull, but true eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and demonstrations of faith in Christ, and this a man doth when hee looks upon his outward actions, as flowing from the inward actions of his minde, and upon the inward actions of his minde, as flowing from the habits of grace within him, and upon the habits of grace within him, as flowing from his justification, and upon his justification, as flowing from his faith, and upon his faith, as given by, and imbracing Jesus Christ, thus I say, if hee rests not till he come to Christ, his markes and signes are not deceitfull but true.</p>

               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>Why, reward in our common sence, is that which is conceived to come from God, or to be given by God, which is, a fancying of Heaven under carnall notions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding it as a place where there is freedome from all misery and fulnesse of all pleasures and happinesse, and to be obteyned by our own works and doings. But reward in the Scripture sence, is not so much, that which comes from God, or is given by God; as that which lyes in God: even the full frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God himselfe in Christ.<note place="margin">Gen. 15.1.</note> 
                  <hi>I am, sayth God to</hi> Abraham, <hi>thy shield and thy exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great reward:</hi>

                  <hi>and I shall be satisfied, when I awake with thy like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> And the means to obteyne this reward is not by doing, but by believing: <hi>even by drawing neere with a true heart in the full as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10.22.</note> and so, indeed, it is given freely: And therefore, you are not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of that reward which the Scripture speaks of, as if it were the wages of a servant, but as it is the inheritance of sons, and when the Scripture seemeth to induce believers to obedience, by promising this reward; you are to conceive, that the Lord speaketh to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,

                  <hi>but that which is through the faith of Christ,</hi> he doth not think himselfe to be one step neerer to Heaven for all his works and performances; and if hee heare any man prayse him for his gifts and graces, hee will not conceit that he hath obteined the same by his own industry and pains taking, as some men have proudly thought, neyther will hee speak it out as some have done, saying, these gifts and graces have cost mee something, I have taken much pains to obtain them, but he sayth, <hi>Not I, but by the grace of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.10.</note> 
                  <hi>I am that I am, and not I, but the grace of God that was with me:</hi> And if he behold an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant man, or a wicked liver, he will not call him carnall wretch, or prophane fellow; nor say, stand by thy selfe, <hi>come not neere to mee,</hi>

               <p>But by your favour, Sir, if faith be the gift of God, and he give it, when, and to whom he pleaseth, then I conceive that mans using such means will not procure any greater measure of it then God is pleased to give.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>I confesse it is not the means that will either beget or increase faith, but it is the Spirit of God in the use of the means that doth it, so that as the means will not doe it without the Spirit, neither will the Spirit doe it without the means, where the means may be had, wherefore I pray you doe not you hinder him from using the means.</p>

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60509:113"/>
not be able perfectly to apprehend Christ, and so consequently shall not be able to live without sin: therefore I pray you, Sir, tell me how you would have mee to be affected, when I shall hereafter through frailty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any sin.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>Before I can give you a true and full satisfactory answer to this your necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry question, I must intreat you to consider with me.</p>
               <p>First, that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. it is sayd concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> believers, <hi>Yee are not under the Law, but under grace:</hi> And in like manner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.6. it is sayd, <hi>But now we are delivered from the Law:</hi> And yet it is said concerning a believer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.21. <hi>Being not without Law to God, but under the Law to Christ:</hi> And in like manner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. it is sayd, <hi>Doe wee then make voyd the Law through faith? God for bid, yea, by faith we establish the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.6. It is sayd,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>That whosoeuer abideth in Christ sinneth not:</hi> and in like manner, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin.</hi> And yet it is sayd concerning such, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8. <hi>If we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us,</hi> and in like manner, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. <hi>In many things we offend all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That in <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.21. It is


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60509:114"/>
sayd concerning believers, Hee (that is to say God) hath not beheld iniquity in <hi>Jacob, neither hath he seen perversnesse in Israell,</hi> &amp; in like manner, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.7. It is sayd, <hi>behold, thou art all faire my love, and there is no spot in thee,</hi> And yet it is sayd, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.21. as well concerning believers as others, <hi>that the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and hee pondereth all his goings,</hi> and in like manner, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. <hi>All things are naked and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto the eyes of him, with whom we have to doe.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, That in <hi>Isai.</hi> 27.4. the Lord sayth concerning believers, <hi>Anger is not in me,</hi> and in like manner, <hi>Isai.</hi> 54.9. it is sayd, <hi>As I have sworn that the waters of</hi> Noah <hi>shall no more goe over the earth, so have I sworn, that I would no more be wrath with thee, nor rebuke thee:</hi> and yet it is sayd, <hi>Psal.</hi> 10.40. <hi>That because the people went a whoring after their own inventions, therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against this people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance:</hi> And in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Moses</hi> a true believer sayth, <hi>The Lord was angry with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, That in <hi>Isai.</hi> 40.2. The Lord sayth concerning believers, <hi>Speake yee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her


<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60509:114"/>
iniquity is pardoned,</hi> for indeed, Christ paid God, till hee sayd hee had enough,<note place="margin">

                  </note> hee was fully satisfied, fully contented, and therefore in <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.20. it is sayd, that in those dayes, and at that time, <hi>the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none, and the sinnes of Judah, and they shall not be found:</hi> for by Christs death Satan, sinne, and Death were conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and taken captive, and whatsoever might bee brought against us was taken away as the least bill or scroule,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ball</hi> on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. <hi>pag.</hi> 41.</note> and yet it is sayd concerning the seed and children of Jesus Christ, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.30. <hi>If they forsake my Law, and walke not in my judgements, then will I visit your transgressions with the rod, and their iniquities with stripes</hi>: and in like manner, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30, it is sayd, concerning believers, <hi>For this cause many are weak and sickly amongst you, and many sleepe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now though all these Scriptures speake contrary one to another, yet they all speake truth, for they bee all of them the words of truth, and that it may appeare to you that they doe so, I pray you take notice that where belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are sayd not to bee under the Law, and freed from the Law, it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the Law, as it is the covenant


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60509:115"/>
of works, and where it is sayd that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are under the Law, and that faith esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth the Law; it is to bee understood of the Law, as it is the law of Christ, now if believers be not under, but are freed from the law of works, or covenant of works, then though they doe transgresse the law, yet they doe not transgresse the Covenant of works, and if they transgresse not the covenant of works, then cannot God see any transgression of theirs, as a transgression against that Covenant. And if he see it not, then can ye neither be angry with them, nor yet chastise them for it: But if believers be under the Law, and faith doe establish the Law as it is the Law of Christ, then if they transgresse any of the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they transgresse the Law of Christ, and if they transgresse the Law of Christ, then doth Christ see it, and if Christ see it, he will be both angry with them, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise them for it.</p>
               <p>Now then neighbour <hi>Neophytus,</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply these things to you, and so to give you a particular answer to your question, you are to know that you are not now under the Law, but are by Christ freed from it, as it is the Law of works, and therefore whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you shall hereafter through frailty trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, any of the ten Commandements, you


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60509:115"/>
are not to thinke you have thereby transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Covenant of works, neither are you to conceive, that God either sees your trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, or is angry with you, or doth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise you for them, as they are any way a transgression of that Covenant, for you being freed from that Covenant, and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from sinning against it, must needs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be freed from all wrath, anger, mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, calamities and afflictions, as fruits, and effects of any transgression, against that Covenant.</p>
               <p>But yet whilst you live, you are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that you are under the Law of Christ, and therefore whensoever you doe swerve or goe away, from the rule of any of the ten Commandements, you must perswade your selfe that you have thereby transgressed the Law of Christ, and that hee sees it, and is displeased with you for it, and if you be not grieved for it, and doe not reforme it, Christ will chastise you for it, either by hiding his face, and withdrawing the light of his countenance from you, and so by depriving you of peace and comfort in him for a time, or else by some outward losse or crosse in this World, for that is the penalty of the Law of Christ, so that if you, or any believer else, doe transgresse the Law of Christ, <hi>if need be,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.6.</note> you shall bee as sure of temporall

corrections, as an unbeliever that transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the covenant of works, shall be of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation in hell, wherefore, I beseech you, according to my exhortation, and your resolution, first, be carefull to exercise your faith, and use all meanes to increase it, <hi>that so it may become effectuall working by love,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Thes. 1.3.</note> for according to the measure of your faith,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.6.</note> will be your true love to Christ, and to his will and commandements, and according to the measure of your love to them, will be your delight in them, and your aptnesse and readinesse to doe them, and hence it is that Christ sayth,<note place="margin">Iohn 14.15.</note> 
                  <hi>If ye love me keep my commandements,</hi> and hence it is, that the believing soule, according to the measure of its faith,<note place="margin">Psal 40.8.</note> sayth with the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, <hi>I delight to doe thy will ô my God, yea, thy law is within my heart!</hi> for this is the love of God (sayth that loving Disciple) <hi>that we keep his commandements,</hi>

                  <hi>and his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements are not grievous,</hi> nay, the very truth is, nothing will be more grievous to your soule, then that you cannot keep them as you would; ô this love of God being truly rooted in your heart, will make you say with godly <hi>Joseph,</hi> in case you be tempted, as he was,<note place="margin">Gen. 39.9.</note>

gracious a Father, and so mercifull a Saviour? no, I will not doe it, no, I cannot doe it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, If in case you be at any time by reason of the weaknesse of your faith, &amp; strength of your tentation drawn aside, and prevailed with to transgresse any of Christs Comande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then beware that you do not thereupon take occasion to call Christs love to you into question, but believe as firmly that he loves you as dearly as he did before, you thus trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed, for this is a certain truth, as no good in you; or done by you, did move, or can move Christ to love you the more, so no evill in you or done by you, can move him to love you the lesse, no assure your selfe that as he first loved you freely, so will he hereafter heal your back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding, and still love you freely, <hi>Hosea</hi> 14.4. yee, hee will love you unto the end, <hi>John</hi> 13.1. And therefore as you must be nothing in your selfe, in case of your most exact obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, so must you be all in Christ in case of your most imperfect and defective obedience, the which if you be, why then the love of Christ will constrain you to mourn with an evangelicall or Gospell mourning; reasoning with your self after this manner, and is it so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, though I have thus sinned, yet will the Lord love me never the lesse for all that, and am I as much in his favour now, and as sure of erernall happinesse with

               <p>Sir, in this your answer to his que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, you have also answerd me, and given me full satisfaction in divers points, about which my friend <hi>Antinomista</hi> and I have had many a wrangling fit: for if I used to affirme with tooth and nayle (as men use to say) that believers are under the Law, and not delivered from it, and that they doe sin, and that God sees it, and is angry with them, and doth afflict them for it, and that therefore they ought to humble themselves and mourn for their sins, and confesse them, and crave pardon for them, and yet truly, I must confesse, I did not understand what I sayd, nor whereof I affirmed; and the reason was because I did not know the difference betwixt the law, as it is the law of works, and as it is the law of Christ.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
               <p>And believe me, Sir, I used to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, as earnestly as hee, that believers are delivered from the law, and therefore do not sin, and therefore God can see no sin in them, and therefore is neyther angry with them, nor doth afflict them for sin, and therefore they have no need eyther to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or mourn, or confesse their sins, or beg pardon for them, the which I believing to be true, could not conceive how the contrary could be true also, but now I plainly see, that by meanes of your distinguishing betwixt


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60509:119"/>
the law as it is the law of works, and as it is the law of Christ; there is a truth in both, &amp; therefore friend <hi>Nomista,</hi> whensoever eyther you or any man else, shall hereafter affirme that believers are under the law &amp; do sin, &amp; God sees it, and is angry with them, and doth chastise them for it, and that they ought to humble themselves, mourn, weep and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse their sins, and beg pardon for them, if you mean onely as they are under the law of Christ, I will agree with you, and never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict you again.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Nom.</speaker>
               <p>And truly friend <hi>Antinomista,</hi> if eyther you or any man else shall hereafter affirme, that believers are delivered from the law, and do not sin, and God sees no sin in them, nor is angry with them, nor afflicts them for their sins, and that they have no need eyther to humble themselves, mourne, confesse, or crave pardon for their sins, if you mean it onely as they are not under the law of works, I will agree with you and never contradict you again.</p>

               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>I rejoyce to heare you speak these words each to other, and truly now I am in hope, that you two will come back from both your extreams, and meet my neighbour <hi>Neophytus</hi> in the golden Meane, having as the Apostle sayth, <hi>the same love, being of one accord, and of own minde.</hi>

               <p>Sir, For my part, I thanke the Lord, I do now plainly see that I have erred exceedingly, in seeking to be justified, as it were, by the works of the law, and yet could I never be perswaded to it before this day, nor indeed should not have been perswaded to it: now had not you so plainly and fully handled this threefold law, and truly, Sir, I doe now unfainedly desire to renounce my self, and all that ever I have done, and by faith to adhere onely to Jesus Christ, for now I see that hee is all in all, ô that the Lord would enable me so to do! and I beseech you, Sir, pray for me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
               <p>And truly, Sir, I must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that I have erred as much on the other hand, for I have been so far from seeking to be justified by the works of the law, that I have neyther regarded law nor works, but now I see mine errour, I purpose (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) to reform it</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>The Lord grant that you may, but how do you neighbour <hi>Neophytus,</hi> for (me thinks) you look very heavily.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neo.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, Sir, I was thinking of that place of Scripture where the Apostle exhorts us to <hi>examine our selves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.5.</note> 
                  <hi>whether we be in the faith or no:</hi> whereby it seems to mee, that a man may think he is in the faith, when he is not, therefore, Sir, I would gladly heare how


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60509:120"/>
I may be sure that I am in the faith,</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Evan</speaker>
               <p>I would not have you to make any question of it, since you have grounded your faith upon such a firme foundation as will never fail you, for the promise of God in Christ is of a tried truth, and never yet failed any man, nor never will, therefore I would have you to close with Christ in the promise without making any question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are in the faith or no, for there is an assurance which ariseth from the exercise of faith, by a direct act, and that is when a man by faith directly layes hold upon Christ, and concludes assurance from thence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neo.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I know that the foundation whereon I am to ground my faith remayneth sure, and I think I have already built there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but yet because, I conceive, a man may thinke hee hath done so when hee hath not: therefore would I fain know how I may be assured that I have done so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eva.</speaker>
               <p>Wel, now I understand you what you mean, it seems you do not want a ground for your believing; but for your believing that you have believed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neo.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, indeed, that is the thing I want.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>Why, the next way to finde out and know this, is to looke backe and reflect upon your own heart, &amp; consider what acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons


<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60509:120"/>
have passed through there; for, indeed, this is the benefit that a reasonable soul hath,<note place="margin">Doctor <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> of Faith, <hi>pag.</hi> 84.</note> that it is able to returne upon it selfe, to see what it hath done, which the soul of a beast cannot do: Consider then, I pray you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the free and full promise of God in Christ hath not beene so cleered unto you, that you had nothing to object why it did not belong particularly to you: and whether you have not seen a readinesse and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in Christ to receive and embrace you as his beloved Spouse. And whether you have not thereupon consented, and resolved to take Christ, and to give up yourselfe to him: and whether you have not since that found in your heart a love to Christ and his law, and a readinesse and willingnes to doe your duty to God as a childe to his father, freely without feare of hell, or hope of Heaven: now tell me (I pray you truly) whether you have not found these things in you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Neo.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, indeed, I hope I have in some measure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>Why, then I may say with the Apostle <hi>John, You are of the truth, and may assure or perswade your heart before God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Iohn 3.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Wherefore,</hi> sayth Christ to you, <hi>I say unto thee, that thy many sins are forgiven thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 7.47.</note> 
                  <hi>for thou lovest much.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
               <p>But, Sir, shall he not in so doing


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60509:121"/>
turne back from the Covenant of grace, to the covenant of works, and from Christ, to himselfe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed if he should looke upon these things in himselfe, and thereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that because he hath done thus, God hath accepted of him and justified him, and will save him, and so make them the ground of his believing, this were to turn back from the Covenant of grace to the Covenant of works, and from Christ to himselfe, But if he look upon these things in himselfe, and thereupon conclude, that because these things are in his heart, Christ dwels there by faith, and therefore he is accepted of God, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, and shall certainly be saved, and so make them an evidence of his believing, or the ground of his believing that he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, this is neither to turn back from the Covenant of grace, to the Covenant of works, nor from Christ to himselfe, so that these things in his heart being the daughters of faith, and the of-spring of Christ, though they cannot at first produce or bring forth their mother,<note place="margin">

               <speaker>Nom.</speaker>
               <p>But I pray you, Sir, are there not other things besides these that he sayth, hee finds in himselfe that a man may looke upon as evidences of his believing (or as you call


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60509:121"/>
them) as grounds of his believing, that hee hath believed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, indeed, besides these inward qualifications that are in the heart, there are outward qualifications in the life, as having respect unto all Christs Commandements, which a man may look upon as an evidence, provided, that hee be sure it flow from those within.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nom.</speaker>
               <p>But, Sir, how should a man know that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>The sure and best way to know this is, for a man to examine himselfe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did first believe in Christ, and then reforme his life, and so made his faith the cause of the change of his life, or whether he did first reforme his life, and then believe, and so made his reformation of life the cause of his faith, if he be sure he did the former, then may he be sure that his outward qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations proceeded from his inward, and so are right and true, but if hee did the latter, then may he be sure that they are wrong and false evidences.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nom.</speaker>
               <p>Then truly, Sir, I have not as yet any right and true evidences of faith.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>If you have not then as I tell you, it is time to believe, that so you may have them that are right and true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neo.</speaker>
               <p>But, Sir, I pray you let me ask you


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60509:122"/>
one question more touching this point, and that is, suppose, that hereafter I should see no outward evidences, and question whether I had ever any true inward evidences, and so whether I did ever truly believe or no: What must I do then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed, it is possible you may come to such a condition, and therefore you doe well to provide aforehand for it. Now then if ever it shall please the Lord to give you over to such a condition, first, let mee warn you to take heed of forcing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining your selfe to yield obedience to Gods Commandements, to the end you may so get an evidence of faith again, or a ground to lay your believing that you have believed upon, and so forcibly to hasten your assurance before the time, for though this be not to turn quite back to the covenant of works (for that you shall never do) yet is it to turn aside towards that covenant, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Cotton</hi> of <hi>New England,</hi> in his thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth quest.</note> who after that he had long wayted for the promised seed, (though he was before ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by believing the free promise) yet for the more speedy satisfying of his faith, hee turned aside to go in unto <hi>Hagar,</hi> who was (as you have heard) a type of the covenant of works, so that you see this is not the right way:<note place="margin">Poore doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christian, <hi>Pag.</hi> 37.</note> but the right way for you in this case, to get your assurance again is, when all other


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60509:122"/>
things fail to look to Christ; That is, go to the word and promise and leave off and cease a while to reason about the truth of your faith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Goodwins</hi> child of light, <hi>p.</hi> 194.</note> and set your heart on work to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as if you had never yet done it, saying, in your heart, well Satan, suppose my faith hath not been true hitherto, yet now will I begin to endevour after true faith: and therefore, ô Lord! here I cast my self upon thy mercy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh, <hi>For in thee the fatherlesse finde mercy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hosea 14.3.</note> thus I say, hold to the word, goe not away, but keep you here,<note place="margin">Luke 8.15.</note>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Neo.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Sir, you have fully satisfied the concerning that point, but as I remember it followeth in the same Verse,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Know yee not your owne selves how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be repoobates:</hi> wherefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to heare how a man may know that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ is in him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>Why, if Christ be in a man? hee lives in him, as sayth the Apostle, <hi>I live not, but Christ liveth in me.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>

               <p>But how then shall a man know that Christ lives in him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>Why, in what man soever Christ lives according to the measure of his faith he executes his threefold office in him, <hi>viz.</hi> his Propheticall, Priestly, and Kingly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>

               <speaker>Neo.</speaker>
               <p>I desire to hear more of this threefold office of Christ, and therefore (I pray you Sir) tell me, first, how a man may know that Christ executes his Propheticall office in him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>Why, so far forth as any man heares and knows that there was a covenant made, betwixt God, and all mankinde in <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 5.27.</note> and that it was an equall covenant, and that Gods justice must needs enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the breach of it, and that all mankind for that cause were lyable to eternall death and damnation, so that if God had condemned all mankinde, yet had it beene but the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of an equall and just Judge, seeking ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the execution of his justice then mans ruine and destruction, and thereupon takes it home, and applyes it particularly to himself, and so is convinced that hee is a miserable lost and helplesse man; I say so far forth as a man doth this, CHRIST executes his Propheticall office in him, in teaching him, and revealing unto him the covenant of works.

               <p>But stay, Sir, I pray you, how can it be sayd that mans soule doth re-aspire towards God the Creator, when as it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that every mans soule naturally is bent towards the creature, to seeke a rest there.</p>

               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>For answer hereunto, I pray you consider, that naturally mans understanding is dark and blinde, and therefore is ignorant what his own soul doth desire, and strongly aspire unto, it knoweth, indeed, that there is a want in the soule, but till it be enlightned, it knoweth not what it is which the soule wanteth: for, indeed, the case standeth with the soule, as with a child new born, which child by naturall instinct, doth gape and cry for nutriment, yea, for such nutriment as may agree with it tender condition, and if the nurse through negligence, or ignorance, eyther give it no meat at all; or else such as it is not capable of receiving, the childe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth it, and still cryeth in strength of desire after the dug: yet doth not the child in this estate know by any intellectuall power and understanding, what it self desireth: even so mans poore soule doth cry to God as for its proper nourishment, but his understanding like a blind ignorant nurse, not knowing what it cryeth for; doth offer to the heart a creature instead of a Creatour: thus by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60509:128"/>
of the understanding, together with the corruption of the will, and disorder of the affections, mans soule is kept by violence from its proper centre, even God himselfe, ô how many souls are there in the world! that are hindred, if not quite kept from rest in God, by reason that their blinde understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, doth present unto their sensual appetites, varieties of sensuall objects.</p>
               <p>Is there not many a luxurious persons soule hindred, if not quite kept from true rest in God, by that beauty which nature hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in feminine faces; especially when Satan doth secretly suggest into such feminine harts a desire of an artificiall dressing from the head to the foot: yea, and sometimes paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the face like their mother <hi>Jezabel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is there not many a voluptuous Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures soule hindred, if not quite kept from rest in God, by beholding the colour, and tasting the sweetnesse of dainty delicate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, his wine red in the cup, and his beer of amber colour in the glasse: in the Scripture we read of a certain man that fared delicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very day, as if there had been no more but one so ill disposed: but in our times there are certain hundreds, both of men and women, that do not only fare deliciously, but volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously twice every day, if no more?</p>

soul hindered, if not quite kept from rest in God, by the harmonious sound of popular prayse; which like a load-stone draweth the vain-glorious heart to hunt so much the more eagerly, to augment the eccho of such vain windy reputation?</p>
               <p>And is there not many a covetous persons soule hindred, if not quite kept from rest in God, by the cry of great abundance; the words of wealth, and the glory of gain?</p>
               <p>And is there not many a musicall minde hindered, if not quite kept from sweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in God, by the harmony of artificiall concord upon musicall instruments?</p>
               <p>And how many perfumed fools are there in the world? who by smelling their sweet apparell, and their sweet nose-gayes, are kept from souls sweetnesse in Christ.

               <p>You say the truth, and yet let mee tell you withall, that a man by the power of naturall conscience may bee forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that his hopes of happinesse are in God alone, and not in these things, yea, and to forsake profits and pleasures, and all sensuall objects, as unable to give his soule any true contentment, and fall to the performance of religious exercises, and yet rest there, and never come to God for rest, and if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it either in the rude multitude of sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all livers, or in the more seemingly religious, we shall perceive that the religious exercises of men, doe strongly deceive, and strangely delude many men, of their hearts happinesse in God.</p>
               <p>For the first sort, though they be such as make their belly their best God, and doe no Sacrifice but to <hi>Bacchus, Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Venus,</hi> though their conscience doe accuse them, that these things are nought, yet in that they have the name of Christians put upon them in their baptisme, and for as much as they doe often repeat the Lords Prayer, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Creed, and the ten Commandements, and in that it may be they have lately accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed

themselves to goe to Church, to heare divine service, and a preaching now and then, and in that they have divers times received the Sacrament, they will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded but that God is well pleased with them, and a man may as well perswade them that they are not men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as that they are not in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>And for the second sort, that ordinarily have more humane wisdome and humane learning then the former sort, and seeme to bee more holy and devout then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sort of sensuall, ignorant people, yet how many are there of this sort, that never passe farther then the outward court of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily performances, feeding and feasting themselves as men in a dreame, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselves to have all things, and yet indeed have nothing but onely a bladder full, or rather a brainfull of winde and worldly conceptions.</p>
               <p>Are there not some who give themselves to a more speciall searching and seeking out for knowledge in Scripture, learnednesse, and Clerklike skill, in this Art, and that Language, till they come to bee able to repeate all the historicall places in the Bible, yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

some private opinion of theirs concerning Ceremonies, Church-government, or other such circumstantiall points of Religion, touching which points they are very able to reason and dispute, and to put forth such curious questions as are not easily answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>Are not some of these men called Sect-makers, and begetters or devisers of new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions in Religion, especially in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of worshiping God, as they use to call it, wherein they finde a beginning, but hardly any end, for this religious knowledge is so variable through the multiplicity of curious wits and contentious Spirits, that the life of man way seeme too short to take a full view of this variety; for though all Sects say, they will bee guided by the word of truth, and all seeme to bring Scripture, which indeed is but one as God is but one, yet by reason of their severall constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and interpretations of Scripture, and conceits of their own humane wisdome, they are many.</p>
               <p>And are there not others of this sort of men, that are readie to embrace any new way of worship, especially if it come under the cloake of Scripture learning, and have a shew of truth founded upon the letter of the Bible, and seeme to bee more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous


<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60509:130"/>
and devout then their former way, specially if the teacher of that new way can but frame a sad and demure countenance, and with a grace lift up his head and his eyes towards heaven, with some strong groane in declaring of his newly conceived opinion, and that hee frequently use this phrase of the glory of GOD! ô then these men are by and by of another opinion, supposing to themselves that God hath made known some farther truth to them, for by reason of the blindnesse of their understanding, they are not able to reach any supernaturall truth, although they doe by literall Learning, and Clerklike cunning dive never so deepe into the Scriptures, and therefore they are ready to entertaine any forme of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Exercise, as shall bee suggested unto them.</p>
               <p>And are there not a third sort much like to these men that are excessive and mutable in the performance of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Exercises. Surely Saint PAUL did perceive that this was the very GOD of some men in his time, and therefore hee willeth TIMOTHY to instruct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that <hi>bodily exercise profiteth little,</hi>

Now these bodily exercises are mutable and variable, according to their conceits and opinions, for all Sects have their severall services (as they call them) yet all bodily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for the most part onely bodily, the which they performe to establish a rest to their soules, because they want rest in God, and hence it is that their peace and rest is up and down ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their working better or worse, so many Chapters must be read, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sermons must bee heard, and so many times must pray in one day, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes in the weeke, or in the yeare, they must fast, &amp;c. or else their soules can have no rest, but mistake mee not I pray, in imagining that I speake against the doing of these things, for I doe them all my selfe, but against resting in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, the which I desire not to doe.</p>
               <p>And thus you see that mans blinde un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding doth not onely present unto the sensuall appetite, sensuall objects, but also to the rationall appetites, rationall objects, so


<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60509:131"/>
that mans poore soule is not onely kept from rest in God by means of sensuality, but also by means of formality: if Satan cannot keep us from seeking rest in God, by feedeing our senses with our mother <hi>Evahs</hi> apple, then he sets us to seeke him in away where wee shall never finde him, if he cannot doe it more grosely, then hee attempts to doe it more closely.</p>

               <speaker>Evan.</speaker>
               <p>Ineeed I am perswaded there are some men that are carefull to performe such duties in obedience to the will of God in Christ, as conceiving them to be the way, wherein he is accustomed to meete his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and give them an extraordinary visit, as also conceiving them to be the meanes whereby hee doth ordinarily beget and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease faith, whereby they are enabled to draw neer to God in Christ, and so to have peace and rest in him, and therefore if they doe omit any of these duties, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that God calls them thereunto, they are troubled in their mindes, and vexed at them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for being disobedient to the will of God, and for missing his kinde visit, and


<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60509:132"/>
omitting the meanes of increasing their faith, now such men as these may, and doubtlesse doe finde true rest to their soules in God, in the performance of Religious Exercises.</p>
               <p>But alas, I feare me, that the most part of such men as are so religiously exercised, and are of such dispositions as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, doe rather conceive, that as they have offended and displeased God by their former disobedience, so they must pacifie and please him by their future obedience, and therefore they are carefull to exercise themselves in this way of duty, and that way of worship, and all to that end, yea, and they conceiving that they have corrupted, defiled and polluted themselves by their falling into sin, they must also purge, clense and purifie themselves by rising out of sin, and walking in new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and so all the good they doe, and all the evill they eschew is to pacifie God, and appease their own consciences, and if they seeke rest to their soules this way, why it is the way of the Covenant of works, where they shall never be able to reach God, nay, it is the way to come to God out of Christ, where they shall never be able to come neere him, he being a consuming fire.</p>

               <p>Then, Sir, it seemeth to me, that God in Christ apprehended by faith, is the

               <p>I, there is the true rest indeed, there is that rest which <hi>David</hi> invites his soule unto, when he sayth,<note place="margin">Psal. 116.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Returne unto thy rest, ô my soule, for we which have believed have entred into his rest,</hi> saith the Authour to the Hebrews. And <hi>come unto me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 4.3.</note> sayth Christ, <hi>all yee that labour and are heavie laden and I will give you rest.</hi> And truly my neighbours and friends believe it, wee shall never finde a hearts happinesse, and a true soules rest untill we finde it here, for howsoever a man may thinke if hee had this mans wit, and that mans wealth, this mans honour, and that mans pleasure, this wife, or that husband, such children, and such servants, his heart would be satisfied, and his soule would be contented, yet which of us hath not by our own experience found the contrary? for not long after that we have obtained the thing we did so much desire, and wherein we promised our selves so much happinesse, rest and content, we have found nothing but vanity and emptinesse in it: Let a man but deale plainly with his own heart and hee shall finde, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he hath many things, yet there is ever one thing wanting, for indeed, mans soule cannot be satisfied with any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no, not with a world of creatures:


<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60509:133"/>
And the reason is because the desires of mans soule are infinite, according to that infinite goodnesse which it once lost in losing God; yea, and mans soul is a spirit, and therefore cannot communicate with any corporall thing, so that all creatures not being that infinite and spirituall fulnesse which our hearts have lost, and towards the which they do still re-aspire, they cannot give it full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
               <p>Nay, let mee say more, howsoever a man may in the midst of his sensuall fulnesse be convinced in his conscience, that he is at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with God, and therefore in danger of his wrath and eternall damnation, and be thereupon moved to reforme his life, and amend his ways, and endevour to seek peace and rest to his soul, yet this being in the way of works it is impossible that he should finde it; for his conscience wil ever be accusing him, that this good duty hee ought to have done, and hath not done it; and this evill he ought to have forborne; and yet hee hath done it: and in the performance of this duty he was remisse, and in that duty very defective, and many such wayes will his soul be disquieted. But when a man once comes to believe that all his sins, both past, present, and to come, are freely and fully pardoned, and God in Christ graciously reconciled unto him: the


<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60509:133"/>
Lord doth hereupon so reveale his fatherly face unto him in Christ, and so make known that incredible union betwixt him and the believing soul; that his heart becomes quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contented in God, who is the proper ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its being: for hereupon there come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> into the soule such peace flowing from the God of peace; that it fils the emptinesse of the soule with true fulnesse, in the fulnesse of God; so that now the heart ceaseth to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest the understanding and reason, in seeking eyther variety of objects, or augmentation of degrees, in any comprehensible thing: And that because the restlesse longing of the minde which did before cause unquietnesse, and disorder, both in the variety of mentall projects, and also in the sensuall and beastly exercises of the corporall and externall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, is satisfied and truly quieted, for when a mans heart is at peace in God, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come truly full in that peace and joy, passing understanding, then the Devill hath not that hope to prevaile against our souls, as hee had before, hee knows right well that it is in vaine to beat his hooke, with profits, pleasures, honour, or any other such like seeming good, to catch such a soule that is thus at quiet in God, for he hath all fulnesse in God, and what can be added to fulnesse, but it runneth over, indeed empty

hearts like empty hogsheads, are fit to receive any matter which shall be put into them, but the heart of the believer being filled with joy and peace in believing, doth abhorre all such base allurements, for that it hath no roome in it selfe to receive any such seeming contentments, so that to speak as the truth is, there is nothing that doth truly and unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly root wickednesse out of the heart of man, but only the true tranquility of the minde, or the rest of the soul in God, and to say as the thing is, this is such a peace and such a rest to the creature in the Creatour, that according to the measure of its esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment by faith, no created comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, can eyther adde to it or detract from it, the increase of a Kingdome cannot augment it, the greatest losses and crosses in worldly things cannot diminish it, a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers good works doe all flow from it, and ought not to return to it: neyther ought hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailties to molest it, howver this is most certain, neyther sin nor Satan, law nor conscience, hell nor grave, can quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish it, for it is the Lord alone that gives and mayntains it:<note place="margin">Psal. 73.25.</note>

            <sp>

               <p>For two reasons, first, because that as the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> when they were got out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> did yet wander many yeers in the wildernesse before they came into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> even so doe many men wander long in rationall and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious exercises, after they have left a sensuall life, before they come to rest in God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was a type.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because as in a wildernesse, men often lose themselves and can finde no way out, but supposing (after long travell) that they are neere the place whither they would goe, are in truth further off: even so fareth it with many, yea, with all such as walk in the way of reason, they lose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the woods and bushes of their works and doings, so that the longer they travell, the further they are from God, and true rest in him.</p>

do not contemn nor despise the use of reason, onely I would not have you to establish it to the chief good, but I would have you to keep it under, so that if with <hi>Hagar,</hi> it attempt to beare rule, and Lord it over your faith, then would I have you in the wisdome of God, like <hi>Sarah,</hi> to cast it out from having domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in few words I would have you more strong in desire, than curious in speculation; and to long more to feele communion with God, then to be able to dispute of the <hi>genus,</hi> or <hi>species</hi> of any question, eyther humane or divine: And presse hard to know God by powerfull experience, and though your knowledge be great, and your obedience surpassing many; yet would I have you to be truly nullified, anihilated, and made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and become fools in all fleshly wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and glory in nothing, but only in the Lord, and I would have you with the eye of faith sweetly to behold, all things extracted out of one thing, &amp; in one to see al, in a word, I would have in you a most profound silence, contemning all curious questions and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, and to ponder much in your heart but prate little with your tongue;<note place="margin">Iam. 1.10.</note>

                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:60509:142"/>I answer, If thou doe evill, it is a sure ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that thou art evill, and wantest faith, if thou doe good, it is an argument that thou art good, and hast faith, for a good tree beareth good fruit, and an evill tree evill fruit; yet good fruit maketh not the tree good, nor evill fruit the tree evill; so that man is good before he doe good works, and evill before he doe evill works.</p>
                  <p>Faith maketh the good tree, and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity the evill tree, such a tree, such fruit; such a man, such works; for all things which are done in faith please God and are good works, and all that are done without faith, displease God, and are evill works.</p>
                  <p>Whosoever believeth or thinketh to bee saved by his works, denyeth that Christ is his Saviour, for how is he thy Saviour if thou mightest save thy selfe by thy works? or wherefore should he have died for thee, if any works might have saved thee.</p>
                  <p>Now seeing that he hath paid the debt, thou needest not pay it, neither indeed couldst thou pay it, but shouldest be damned if his bloud were not, but sith hee was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for that thou shalt not bee puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</p>
                  <p>Finally, hee hath delivered thee from thy condemnation, and all evill, and desireth naught of thee, but that thou wilt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

what hee hath done for thee, and beare it in minde, and that thou wouldest helpe others for his sake both in word and deed, even as hee hath holpen thee, for naught and without reward.</p>
                  <p>O how ready would men bee to help o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers if wee knew his goodnesse and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse towards us, hee is a good and a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Lord, and doth all for naught, therefore let us follow his steps.</p>
                  <p>So that I doe not say, that believers should doe no good works, but I say men should not doe good works, to the intent to get the inheritance of heaven through good works, for if we believe we shall get remission of sins, or the inheritance of heaven through works, wee believe not to get the same for Christs sake, neither doe we believe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God that they are given us freely, and so we make God a lyar, for God sayth, thou shalt have the inheritance of heaven for my Sons sake, thy sins are forgiven thee for my Sons sake, but thou sayst it is not so, if thou think to win them by thy works. Thus you see that I condemne not good works, but the false trust in them, for all the works wherein man putteth any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, are therewith poysoned and become evill.</p>
