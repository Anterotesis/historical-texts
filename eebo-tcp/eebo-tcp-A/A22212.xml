            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

is the ſhert of chaſtite / without whiche no
goodnes can be vertuous / as ſaynct Gregorie
ſayth in his Omelis: Nullum bonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt ſine caſtitate.
Chaſtite is likened to Biſſe / whiche is a kynd of
lynen clothe as white as ſnowe / and it groweth
in the partes of Egypt and Hieruſalem. This
lynen clothe er it come to his whitenes / ſuffreth
moche beatynge and wryngynge: In lyke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſo doth chaſtite / er it come to the pure perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
therof: that is to ſay / hit ſuffreth great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
/ in reſiſtynge the prickynges and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptacions
of voluptuous and fleſhely pleaſure.
Alſo as the ſhert is the fyrſt veſture of euery cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature
/ ſo is chaſtite and virginite the fyrſte and
principalleſt vertue of al vertues. For the childe
bryngeth none othere thynge with it out of the
mothers wombe but onely virginite. Therfore
we ought greatly to loue hit / and dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly kepe
hit. For commonly the father and mother loue
moche better theyr fyrſt frute / than the ſeconde
or the thyrde. Virginite is a vertue that highly
pleaſeth god and his angels: to the whiche an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels as
<pb facs="tcp:13665:5"/>
ſayth ſaynt Hieronyme) virginite is nere of
kynrede. This vertue alſo is lykened to yuory / whiche
naturally is white / colde / and ſtronge.
So virginite and chaſtite is white by inocency / colde
by purenes of hert and body / ſtronge and
hardy to reſiſte the fleſſhely temptacions. Hit is
alſo to be noted / that whan yuory waxeth olde / hit
waxeth redde: So lyke wiſe chaſtite purely
and continually kept is a very martyrdome / as
writeth ſaynt Bernarde and ſaynt Hieronyme.
For why / To lyue chaſtely in this mortall body
is the lyfe of an angell: that is to ſaye it is more
to lyue chaſtely in this wretched worlde / than to
reyſe one from dethe to lyfe. Chaſtite alſo is ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
to lylies for theyr manyfolde propreties / the
whiche now I let paſſe for brefenes of time / and
alſo bycauſe I haue copyouſly writen ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

all this let vs take priſoners: one / one ſaynt: an
other / an other / orels many of them after as we
fynde our myndes inflamed with deuocion / to
take one / or to take many. For who that hath
moſte pryſoners ſhall be moſte ryche. And than
we muſte fylle and replenyſſhe our bagges and
ſackes with ſpoylynges: that is to ſay / our deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
and hartes with dyuers gyftes of the holy
gooſte / and with dyuers vertues and graces:
from ſome one the vertue of humylyte / fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome
other Charite: and ſo forthe of other / vntyll our
ſackes be fylled vp. And we enryched muſt take
hede / that we brynge with vs no ſmalle ſackes.
<pb facs="tcp:13665:24"/>
why / after oure deſyre and deuocion / we ſhall
brynge from thence grace / gyftes / indulgence / and
pardone. Nor we muſte nat meruayle / nor
yet gyue ouer the ſiege of this cite / thoughe we
be ſome tyme wounded and beaten backe: For
as it is a great preyſe and honour for a knyght / to
be wounded and ſuffre many a ſtroke / for the
loue of his prynce and mayſter: So in lyke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
hit is great honoure to vs / to ſuffre greatte
payne / and to be greuouſly wounded for goddis
ſake / and for his loue to endure great laboure / great
penance / and temtacion. For if we conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in this batayle and aſſaulte vntyll we dye / we
ſhall be greatly rewarded / and ſhall haue a
crowne of victory: whiche of duty muſte be gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

foughten in this paynefulle lyfe for goddis ſake.
For why / as Iob ſayth:<note place="margin">Iob. vii</note> Militia eſt vita hominis ſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per
