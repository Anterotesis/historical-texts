            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I find, that the main of your discourse is either granted or faintly

but rather, as it were, confessing and avoiding it: They say,
It holds in the notion, but fayles in the Practise; Being clogged with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
appendant inconveniencies, which either wholly frustrate its good
success, or overballance it with other and worse effects, The grand
Objections are these; Some affirm, It will have no influence at all;

(as Lenders they say now do,) for so small a profit, By others, it is offered by way of grave
and friendly advice to Borrowers, that they take heed what they do, For most will be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon purchasing and other dealings, and so their debts generally and ruinously called in,

            </opener>
            <p>I Am glad to find, That the maintainers of our present Rate of Interest, being driven
from their main defences, betake themselves to such Shifts and Colours; It shews.
They would only seem to say somewhat, which in Popular Causes, they think may p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ss
for Reason: In the first place, they tell us the Legal Restraint of Interest at this time will
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40688:3"/>
prove abortive, Law being subordinate to necessity; But if not now, say I, when may
it take effect? surely never, since when borrowers are few it needs not, when many, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
it boots not. Might not this Exception be equally taken against most of our Coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
Laws? And were it not reasonably answered by demanding the Experiment? Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
since the benefits promised by its success are so many and great, And the Evils threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from its miscarriage so few and flender. Yet in regard of the stress it bears, I shall
further examine its strength and substance: First, methinks these Objectours do a little
prevaricate, For if they believed themselves, they might spare their Opposition, and as
persons unconcerned, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eely give it their Passport. Secondly, Let them reflect, whether
the same Argument, having been as confidently urged against Eight <hi>per Cent.</hi> be not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
soyled; And whether though some Necessitous Borrowers have been shrewdly
bitten by Extortion, (as some ever were and will be) yet thousands, who otherwise had
certainly paid higher rates, have not borrowed at Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> and reaped such benefit
by those reducements, as without other unequal payments, would alone have enriched,
or at least fairly relieved them. Thirdly, My Errour, if such, is however charitable, in
judging better of Creditours, then it seems they do of themselves; For whereas they are
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reby represented as contemners of Authority, I rather admit them to be persons
of strict Obedience and great Caution, Presuming they will now, (as formerly most of
them have done) observe that Law, from which they challenge their only Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Warrant Fourthly, Paenal Laws are like large Nets; chiefly designed to catch
the great Fish; some Frie will escape, And it matters not greatly here though they do, For
Single Extortions weigh little in this Ballance, It is the Steady Rate of Interest, which
coming clear into the lenders own Purse, and in ease and certainty far surpassing other
courses, quite turns the scale on that side, so as the Abatement thereof must even natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
buoy up our Lands. Lastly, It seems more then morally certain, That the same
Land which is now accepted for the Loan of a Thousand Pounds at Six pawnes <hi>ipso facto</hi>
for fifteen hundred at four <hi>per Cent.</hi> (there being no other imaginable standard for
Mortgages and consequently for sales) then the computing of Rent with Interest)
whereby Security will be restored; and vastly enlarged, And the Land (acquiring as it
were a new fund) will lightly carry that burthen, which it now hardly bears, soon shake
of its fetters, and in time turn Extortion quite out of Doors.</p>
            <p>The second Objection, Namely, That if Interest be abated, Men will hoard up their
Monies, Seems only considerable from the Quality of those that urge it; who are some
of them wise men, and too wise I doubt, too mean as they speak: I might again refer
them to former Experience, since this likewise within our Memorie hath been once dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved;
Not one that ever I heard of having kept any considerable stock dead for the
Smallness of that Revenue, but too many being even charmed with the Sweetness of it
Insomuch as I have lately known divers, who upon the Overture of a convenient pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase,
consulting their Pillows, and perceiving, (as needs they must if they do no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
wink) the present disparity betwixt Interest and Rent, have parted abruptly; Neither
indeed have I observed any such treaty which this estimate did not govern, sometime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to the utter disappointment, alwayes to the notable pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the greater danger is. That too many will still continue t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to no Account, seems too Panick a fear, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40688:3"/>
we consider the reason of the thing, or temper of the Persons: The Owner of
Land in this fall and casualty of Rents, being generally a looser Accomptant of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
were likelier to incur this Prejudice; And better he might in prudence justifie
his preferring some present want of Revenue before the disparagement of his Land: He
might with good Colour pretend, it hath been overtilled and wants resting; That a
Low Rent will scarce countervail the spoil commonly committed by Tenants at will, and
short termours: However he knows the worst, and that he cannot be robbed of his
Land: Yet how few Farms do we see Vacant, where the Owner is not either by misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
distant of abode, or other more pressing occasions disabled or diverted from the
best managery? Might we not judge him worthier of a Guardian then a Freehold, who
having Land, and not wanting other requisites, should for any considerable time, both
perversely refuse to Let, and carelesly neglect to Stock it? Much more absurd were it
for monied men (no way obstructed) neither to lend nor employ their Stocks; And
therefore to be presumed, that persons so wise in their generation, will not starve for
lack of a Feast, and ruine themselves to incommode some body. Nothing is so like to
interrupt the Free course of Lending (or at least dealing) as the unsoundness of Credit,
and Scarceness of Security, which are evidently improved by Law, but undermined by
high Interest: For that which we call Money lent being upon the matter nothing else,
but Credit from the Lender to the Borrower, and security from the Borrower to the
Lender, (as I have occasion often to repeat, and as appears not only by that e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cellent
Law and Practice of transferring debts in <hi>Holland,</hi> but even by daily proof among our
selves, where a small note, nay a Promise, frequently serves to represent the payment
of a considerable sum) Plenty or Scarcity of Current Security and Credit, (the manifest
effect of high or low Interest,) must needs cause Plenty or Scarcity of Current Money.
Besides the Loan of Money corresponds in good Measure with Letting of Land: Now
the Landlord that Lets good Penny worths seldome wants substantial Tenants, who,
commonly thriveing, pay their Rents punctually, And challenging a kind of Tenant right,
securely repair and improve as upon their own Free-hold: Whereas hard Landlord's
are generally and justly met with by hinderly and troublesome Farmers, and have their
Estates often and ruinously turned into, and lying on their hands. Upon the same
grounds of Reason, may we not observe, That even in this low Ebb of Credit, such as are
known to have sound Estates, and noted to be current paymasters, shall oftimes be
trusted, upon much easier then the common terms of lending; As on the other side,
those that accept low interest, pick and chuse their security. And is it not most preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
but withal most evident, That wheresoever Trade is clogged with high Interest, there
is no end of Pledges and extreme Cautions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the rate is tolerable there appears
little use or need of them, Fame it self in effect serving as the common surety for Borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and few that have a name of honesty wanting convenient Credit? Admit then for
Arguments sake, the Land of this Kingdom most of it to be vastly over-letten, so as no
usual husbandry could raise near the Rent of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (And whether this be not now too like

those contracts; And consequently that the moderating of Interest to a Rate, which
the Land may comfortably bear, is the only means now left for men to lend safely, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
easily, and pay duely, Costly Experience, will some say, may in time rectifie all,
when most that borrow do not pay,, and few that pay borrow: When our great and
numerous incumbrances expiring and discharging themselves in the ruine of most bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers

to do, and our disease abate for want of humour to feed it: But truly I cannot fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
this Remedy, which too much resembles the decay of Nature, and in stead of real
comfort faintly bids us hope, That when things are at the worst they may mend.</p>
            <p>Their last Argument importing the danger of calling in Sums unseasonably by such as
being abridged of their former income will endeavour otherwise to repair their loss, to
the great inconvenience of borrowers, presents more shrewdly to those at least, who
spie not its fallacy and self-contradiction: For quitting all publick considerations; and
yielding, as it were the main dispute, it craftily insinuates it self, and whispers singly
to every borrower this seemingly pertinent Question, What then will become of you,
when all your debts shall be called in together? Now this meeting with the natural <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Borrowers, frights many of them into a Palsie; And the more unreasonable it is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the more unanswerable, since for a groundless and extravagant fear, no humane
wisdom can provide: Thus are the maintainers of this Policy furnished with Arguments
of all kinds and colours, accommodated to every purpose; To the sender they suggest,
that they visibly loose one third of their Revenue, without any hope of recompence, for
that all the improvements from thence expected are silly projects; To the borrower,
that however, in the end it may fare with the Publick, yet they, to be sure will in the mean
time be undone, by a general calling in of Sums to purchase Land; To persons more
indifferent, as not greatly or immediately concerned in either Condition, That abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Interest by Law wil never in any degree answer what is expected from it; For
such as have Power will use it as they list, and no man be induced to purchase or trade
one whit the sooner; To vulgar capacities, that our rich men will hoard, our best
stocks lie dead, and there will scarce be any lending. To reconcile these were indeed a
Masterpiece of wit: But in the mean time, such shifting of Scenes and shuffling of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(so inconsistent,) notably serves to amuse the unwary and embroyle discourse
which in popular causes, as I said before, proves oftimes a dextrous way of Arguing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The only way therefore to deal with such a Proteus is to confront his several Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and hold him strictly to the point, which an unsound Thesis will scarce abide
For Instance, How comes the note to be so changed say I? It was once alledged that Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
would still use their own discretion, and take no notice of any Law for Restraint; The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
in another vein, most men would be so sullen, as neither to Purchase nor Lend; Now
in full career, and, as it were in some grand conspiracy (for plots must be all along pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed)
All will call in their sums together and be dealing: What a sure Bow is this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40688:4"/>
that hath so many and so able strings! But is there no medium betwixt these extreams?
Are there not in the world persons of different Condition, genius, nay humour? Are
there not many by their Education or present Capacity qualified only to live upon Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest?
Are there not others, who being either affected with thrifty retirement, or enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the ease and immunity of good Towns, nay, addicted to special fraternities and
cabales, are so wedded to it, that a sentence of the Spiritual Court would scarce divorce
them? Are there not yet others, who being engaged in Callings and Employments
scarce consistent with Countrey Affairs or Forrain Traffick, may prudently enough
continue to lend at a lower rate, rather then entangle them with such variety of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments?
And may there still be good store of those, who meerly guided by their
natural Arithmetick, do now betake themselves to Interest for its many present advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
but were the tide and stream of Profit turned, would certainly row and Sayle
with it? He that was sent to discover the strength of the French-Army at <hi>Agencourt,</hi>

with that of other dealings, by the same good omen, it might soon appear, that among
our Legions of Creditours, there would be enough greatly to raise the value of our Lands
