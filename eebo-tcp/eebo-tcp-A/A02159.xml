            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Amongſt the reſt, there was the yellow daffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dil, a flowre fit for gelous Dottrels, who through the bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their honeſt wiues grew ſuſpitious,<note place="margin">Daffadil for dotrels that are gelous.</note> &amp; ſo proue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the end cuckhold Heretikes, there budded out the checkerd (Paunſie) or party coloured Harts eaſe an herbe ſieldome ſeene, either of ſuch men as are wedded to ſhrews or of ſuch women as haue haſtie huſbandes: yet there it grew, and as I ſtept to gather it, it ſlipt from me like <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>talus</hi> fruit that failes their maiſter. At laſt, woondring at this ſecret qualitie, I learned that none can weare it, bee they kings, but ſuch as deſire no more then they are borne to, nor haue their wiſhes aboue their fortunes.<note place="margin">Fennel wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens weed.</note> Vppon a banke bororing by grew womens weeds, Fenell I mean for flatterers, fit generally for that Sex, ſithe while they

Methought I ſaw diuers yong courtiers tread vpon it with high diſdain, but as they paſt away, an Adder lurking there bit them by the heeles that they wept: and then I might perceiue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine clownes in clowted ſhoone gather it, and eate of it with greedineſſe: which no ſooner was ſunke into theyr mawes, but they were metamorphoſed, and lookt as proud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly though peſants, as if they had beene borne to bee princes companions.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the reſt of theſe changelings whom the taſt of time had thus altred, there was ſome that lifted their heads ſo hie, as if they had beene bred to look no lower then ſtars, they thought <hi>Noli altum ſapere</hi> was rather the ſaieng of a foole, then the cenſure of a Phyloſopher, &amp; therfore ſtretch themſelues on their tiptoes, as if they had beene a kindred to the lord Tiptoſt, and began to diſdain their equals, ſcorn their inferiours,<note place="margin">Lord Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſt a proud &amp; inſolent Earle raiſed by Edwar. 4.</note> and euen their betters, forgetting nowe that time had taught them to ſay maſſe, how before they had plaid the Clarks part to ſay Amen to the prieſt. Tuſh, then they were not ſo little as Gentlemen, and their owne conceipt was the Herald to blaſon their diſcent, from an olde houſe, whoſe great grandfathers would haue bin glad of a new cottage to hide their heads in. Yet as the peacock wrapt in the pride of his beauteous feathers is knowne to be but a dunghill bird by his foule feet: ſo though the high lookes and coſtly ſutes argue to the eies of the world they were Caualiers of great worſhip, yet the churliſh illibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of their minds, bewraid their fathers were not aboue thrée pounds in the kings bookes at a ſubſidye, but as theſe

            <p>The worlde was not ſo <hi>A principio,</hi> for when veluet was worne but in kings caps, then conſcience was not a broome man in Kent ſtréet but a Courtier, then the farmer was content his ſonne ſhould hold the plough, and liue as he had doone before: Beggars then feared to aſpire, and the higher ſortes ſcornd to enuie. Now euery lowt muſt haue his ſonne a Courtnoll, and thoſe dunghill drudges waxe ſo proud, that they will preſume to weare on their feet, what kings haue worne on their heads. A clownes ſonne muſt be clapt in a veluet pantophle, and a veluet bréech, though the preſumptuous aſſe be drownd in the Mercers booke, and make a conuey of al his lands to the vſurer for commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities: yea the fop muſt goe like a gallant for a while, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at laſt in his age he beg.

            <p>Laſtly, whereas thou ſaiſt thou art a ſeuere ſenſour to puniſh ſinnes, as auſtere as <hi>Cato</hi> to correct vice, of truth I hold thée ſo in penall ſtatutes when thou haſt begged the forfeit of the Prince: but ſuch correction is open extortion and oppreſſion of the poore, nor can I compare it better M. veluet breech, then to the Wolfe chaſtiſing the lambe for diſturbing their fountaine, or the Deuill caſting out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, through the power of Belſebub, and thus much curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſir I haue ſaid, to diſplaie the follies of mine aduerſary, and to ſhew the right of mine owne intereſt. Whye then quoth I, if you haue both ſaid, it reſteth but that we hadde ſome to empanell vpon a Iurie, and then no doubt but the verdict would ſoone be giuen on one ſide. As thus I was talking to them, I might ſée comming downe the hill a braue dapper Dicke, quaintly attired in veluet and Sattin, and a cloke of cloth raſh, with a Cambricke ruffe as ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

ſet, and he as neatly ſpunged, as if he had béene a bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, only I geſt by his pace a farre off he ſhoulde bee a Tailor, his head was holden vppe ſo pert, and his legges ſhackle hamd, as if his knees had béene laced to his thighes with points. Comming more neere indeed, I ſpied a Tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors morrice pike on his breſt, a ſpaniſh néedle, and then I fitted my ſalutations, not to his ſutes but to his trade, and incountred him by a thred bare courteſie, as if I had not knowne him, and aſked him of what occupation he was? A Tailor, quoth he, marry then my friende, quoth I, you are the more welcome, for héere is a great quarrell growne betwixt veluet bréeches and cloth bréeches, for their prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue in England: the matter is growne to an iſſue, there muſt a Iury bee empanelled, and I would deſire and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to be one of the queſt.</p>
            <p>Not ſo, quoth Cloth breeches I chalenge him. And why quoth <hi>I?</hi> What reaſon haue you, dooth he not make them both? yes, quoth he, but his gaines is not alike: alas, by me he getteth ſmall, only he is paide for his workmanſhip, vnleſſe by miſfortune his ſhieres ſlippe awrye, and then his vales is but a ſhred of homeſpunne cloth: Whereas in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of veluet bréeches, where there is required ſilke lace, cloth of gold, of ſiluer, and ſuch coſtly ſtuffe, to welt, gard, whip, ſtitch, edge, face, and draw out, that the vales of one veluet bréech is more then twenty paire of mine. I hope there is no Taylor ſo preciſe, but he can play the cooke and licke his owne fingers: though he looke vp to Heauen, yet he can caſt large ſhreds of ſuch rich ſtuffe into hell vnder his ſhoppe boord. Beſide he ſets downe like the clarke of the Checke a large bill of reckonings, which for he kéepes long in his pocket he ſo powders for ſtincking, that the yoonge vpſtart that néedes it, feeles it ſalt in his ſtomach a month after. Beſides, ſir veluet breeches hath aduanſt him: for whereas in my time he was counted but goodman Tailor, now he is growne ſince veluet bréeches came in, to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a marchant or Gentleman Marchant Tailor, giuing armes and the holye Lambe in his creaſt, where before he
<pb facs="tcp:6189:12"/>
had no other cogniſance, but a plaine Spaniſh néedle with a welſh cricket on the toppe: ſith then his gaines are ſo great and his honours ſo aduanſt by veluet bréeches, I will not truſt his conſcience, nor ſhall hee come vpon my Iury.</p>
            <p>Indéed you haue ſome reaſon quoth I, but perhaps the Tailor doth this vpon meere deuotion to puniſh pride, and hauing no other authoritie nor meanes, thinkes it beſte to pinch them by the purſſe and make them paye well, as to aſke twiſe ſo much ſilke lace and other ſtuffe as would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and yet to ouerreach my yoong maiſter with a bill of reckoning that will make him ſcratch where it itcheth not. Heerein I hold the Tailor for a neceſſary member to teach proud nouices the way to wéeping croſſe: that when they haue waſted what their fathers left them by prid, they may grow ſparing and humble, by inferred pouerty: and by this reaſon, the Taylor plaies Gods part: he exalteth the poore and pulleth downe the proud: For of a wealthy Eſquires ſonne, hee makes a thredbare beggar: and of a ſcornefull Taylor, he ſets vp an vpſtart ſcuruy Gentleman. Yet ſeei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you haue made a reaſonable challenge to him, the Tay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lor ſhall be none of the queſt.</p>
            <p>As I bad him ſtand by,<note place="margin">Al this was gentlemens caſt apparel.</note> there was comming alongſt the valley towards vs, a ſquare ſet fellowe well fedde, and as briſkly apparelled, in a black taffata doublet and a ſpruce leather ierken, with Chriſtall buttons: A cloake facſt afore with veluet, and a Couentry cap of the fineſt wooll, his face ſomething Ruby bluſh, Cherry cheeked, like a ſhredde of ſcarlet or a little darker, like the lees of olde claret wine: a noſe <hi>autem</hi> noſe purphled pretiouſly with pearle &amp; ſtone, like a counterfait work, and betweene the filthye reumy-caſt of his bloudſhotten ſnowt, there appeared ſmall holes, whereat wormes heads peeped as if they meant by theyr appearance to preach and ſhew the antientie and antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his houſe.</p>

No quoth I, nor by the help of God neuer wil haue: but the reaſon is to haue you vpon a Iury. At this word, before I could enter my diſcourſe vnto him, veluet bréeches ſtart vp, and ſwore he ſhould be none of the queſt, he would challenge him, and whye quoth I, what know you by him? This baſe churle is one of the moathes of the Common wealth, he is the ſpoile of yong gentlemen a bloud ſucker of the poore, as thirſty as a horſſe leach that will neuer leaue drinking while he burſt, a knaue that hath intereſt in the leaſes of forty bawdy houſes, a receiuer for lifts, and a diſhonourable ſupporter of cutpurſes, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, he was gotten by an <hi>Incubus</hi> a he Deuill, &amp; brought forth by an ouer worne refuſe, that had ſpent hir youth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the raines of Bowbies Barne.</p>
            <p>O monſtrous inuectiue, quoth I, what reaſon haue you to be thus bitter againſt him? Oh the villaine, quoth he, is the Deuils factor, ſent from hell to torment yong Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men vpon earth: he hath fetcht me ouer in his time, onely in pawnes, in ten thouſand pounde in golde. Suppoſe as Gentlemen through their liberall minds may want that I need, money: let me come to him with a pawne worth ten pound, he wil not lend vpon it aboue thrée pounde, and hee wil haue a bill of ſale and twelue pence in the pound for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery month, ſo that it comes to ſixtéene pence, ſith the byll muſt monthly be renewed, and if you breake but your day, ſet downe in the bill of ſale, your pawne is loſte, as full bought and ſolde, you turnd out of your goodes and hee an vnconſcionable gainer. Suppoſe the beſt, you kéepe your day, yet paying ſixteen pence a month for twenty ſhillings, you pay as good for the lone as foure ſcore in the hundreth, is not this monſtrous exacting vpon Gentlemen.

they cannot be coold vnleſſe they be rubd with the oile of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but the poore man that giues but his bare fée, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps pleads in <hi>forma pauperis,</hi> he hunteth for hares with a taber, and gropeth in the dark to find a needle in a bottle of hay, tuſh theſe lawyers haue ſuch delatory &amp; forren pleas ſuch dormers, ſuch quibs and quiddits, that beggering their clients they purchaſe to themſelues whole lordſhips, it boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not men to diſcourſe their little conſcience, &amp; great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, only ſuffiſe they be not ſo riche as they be bad, and yet they be but too welthy. I inueigh not againſt lawe nor honeſt lawyers, for there be ſome wel qualified, but againſt extorting Ambodexters that wring the poore, and becauſe I know not whether this be ſuch a one or no, I chalenge him not to be of my iury. Why then, <abbr>qd</abbr> I, his worſhip maye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and then I queſtiond what he in the buff ierkin was, Mary <abbr>qd</abbr> he, I am a ſerieant, he had no ſooner ſayde ſo, but veluet breeches leapt back, and drawing his rapyer, ſwore he did not only chalenge him for his iury, but alſo proteſted if he ſtird one foot toward him, he would make him eate a péece of his poinard. And what is the reaſon <abbr>qd</abbr> I, that there is ſuch mortall hatred betwixt you and the Serieant? Oh ſir, quoth Veluet bréeches, ſearch him, and I warrant you the knaue hath precept vpon precept to arreſt mee, hath worne his mace ſmooth, with onely clapping it vpon my ſhoulder he hath had me vnder <hi>coram</hi> ſo often, oh the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is the Vſurers executioner to bring ſuche Gentlemen to Limbo as hée hath ouerthrowne with his baſe brocage and bad commodities: and as you ſée him a fat knaue with a foggie face, wherein a cup of old ſacke hath ſet a ſeale, to marke the bowſie drunkard to die of the dropſie, ſo his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is conſumed, and his harte robd of all remorſe and pitie, that for monie he will betray his owne father, for wil a cormorant but fee him to arreſt a yoong gentleman, the rakehell will be ſo eager to catch him, as a dogge to take a beare by the eares in Parriſh-garden, and when hee hath laid hold vpon him, he vſeth him as courteouſly as a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers cur would doe an oxe chéeke when he is hungrie, if
<pb facs="tcp:6189:16"/>
hée ſée the gentleman hath mony in his purſe, then ſtraight with a cap and knee he carries him to the tauerne and bids him ſend for ſome of his friends to bale him, but firſt he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenants to haue ſome braſe of angels for his paines, and beſides he cals in for wine as gréedily as if the knaues mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had bene broacht againſt a hogſhead when he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, but ſuppoſe the Gentleman wants pence he wil ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue a pawne or elſe dreg him to the counter without reſpect of manhood or honeſtie, I ſhould ſpend the whole day with diſplayeng his villanies, therefore bréefly let this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſe, he was neuer made by the conſent of God, but his ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly carkaſe was framd by the diuell, of the rotten carion of a woolfe, and his ſoule of an vſurers damned ghoſt turnd out of hell into his body to do monſtrous wickedneſſe again vpon the earth, ſo that he ſhall be none of my iurie, neyther ſhall he come nearer me than the length of my rapyer will ſuffer him. Indéed quoth Clothbréeches generally ſerieants be bad but there be amongſt them ſome honeſt men, that will doe their duties with lawfull fauour: for, to ſay truth, if ſerieants were not, how ſhould men come by their debts? marry they are ſo cruell in their office, that if they arreſt a poore man, they will not ſuffer him (if he hath not monie) to ſtay a quarter of an hower to talke with his creditor, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perhaps at the méeting they might take compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but only to the counter with him, vnleſſe he will lay his pewter, bras, couerlets, ſhéets, or ſuch houſholdſtuf, to them for pawn of paiment of ſome coine for their ſtaieng: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let him depart out of the place, for his roome is better than his company. Well then <abbr>qd</abbr> I, what ſay you to theſe three, and with that I queſtiond their names, the one ſayde he was a ſumner, the other a gaoler, and the third an infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: Ieſus bleſſe mee (quoth Cloth breeches) what a Ging was here gathered together, no doubt Hell is broke looſe, and the Diuell meanes to keepe holyday, I make chalenge againſt them all, as agaynſt woorſe men than thoſe that gaue euidence agaynſt Chriſt: for the Sumner it bootes me to ſay little more agaynſt him, than <hi>Chaucer</hi> did in his
<pb facs="tcp:6189:17"/>
Canturbury tales, who ſayd he was a knaue, a bribar, and a bawd, but leauing that authority although it be authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, yet thus much I can ſay of my ſelfe, that theſe drunken drowſie ſons go a tooting abroad (as they themſelues tearm it) which is to here if any man hath got his maid with child or plaies the goodfellow with his neighbors wife, if he find a hole in any mans coat that is of wealth, then hee hath his peremptorie ſcitation readie to ſcite him vnto the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons or officials court, there to appeare and abide the ſhame and penaltie of the lawe, the man perhaps in good credite with his neighbours, loath to bring his name in queſtion, greſeth the ſumner in the fiſt, and then he wipes him out of the booke, &amp; ſuffers him to get twenty with child ſo he kéepe him warm in the hand: he hath a ſaieng to wanton wiues, &amp; they are his good dames, and as long as they féede him with cheeſe bacon, capons, &amp; ſuch od reuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s they are honeſt, and be they neuer ſo bad, he ſwears to the officiall complaints are made vpon enuie and the women of good behauior: tuſh what bawdrie is it he will not ſuffer, ſo he may haue mony and good chere, &amp; if he like the wench wel an ſnatch himſelfe for they knowe all the whores in a country, &amp; are as leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous companions as may be, to be bréefe, the ſumner liues vpon ſins of people, &amp; out of harlotry gets he al his commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. As for the Gaoler, although I haue bene little troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in priſon to haue experience of his knauerie, yet haue I heard the pore priſoners complain how cruel they be to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, extorting with extraordinary fees, ſelling a double curtall (as they cal it) with a double iug of béere for <hi>2</hi> pence, which contains not aboue a pint and a halfe: let a poore man but be arreſted into one of the counters, though hee but ſet his foot in them but halfe an houre, hée ſhall be almoſt at an angels charge, what with garniſh, croſſing and wiping out of the boke, turning the key, paieng the chamberlain, féeing for his iurie, &amp; twenty ſuch extortions inuented by themſelues, and not allowed by any ſtatute, God bles me gaoler from your henhouſes, as I will kéep you from comming in my queſt, and to you M. Informer, you that looke like a ciuile Citizen,
<pb facs="tcp:6189:17"/>
or ſome handſome pettie ſogger of the law: although your crimſon noſe bewraies you can ſup of a coole cup or Sacke without any chewing, yet haue you as much flie knauerie in your ſide pouch there, as woulde bréede the confuſion of forty honeſt men. It maye bee ſir you maruell, whye I exclaime againſt the informer, ſith he is a moſt neceſſarie member in the common wealth, and is highly to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces aduantage for the benefit of pennall ſtatutes and other abuſes, wherof he giueth ſpecial intelligence? To wipe out this doubt I ſpeake not againſt the office but the officer, againſt ſuch as abuſe law when they ſhould vſe it, and ſuch none I geſſe this fellow to be, by the carnation tincture of his ruby noſe. Therefore let vs ſearch his bagge, and ſee what traſh you ſhall find in it: with that although the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former were very loath, yet we pluckt out the ſtuffing of his pouch, and in it was found a hundreth and odde writs: Whereat I wondred: and Cloth bréeches ſmiling, bad mee read ſhe Labels, and the parties names, and then examine the informer how many of them hee knewe, and wherein they had offended. I followed his counſaile, and of all hee knew but three, neither could he tell what they had doone amiſſe to be areſted and brought in queſtion.</p>
            <p>Cloth bréeches ſeeing me ſtand in a maze, began thus to reſolue me in my doubt. Perhaps, quoth he, you maruell why the informer hath all theſe writtes, and knowes ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the parties nor can obiect any offence to them? To this I anſwer: That it being a long vacation, he learned in the rowle all thoſe mens names, and that they were men of in different wealth: Now meanes he to go abroad and ſearch them out and arreſt them, and though they know not wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in or for what cauſe they ſhould be troubled, yet rather then they will come vppe to London and ſpende their money, they will beſtow ſome odde Angell of Maiſter infourmer, and ſo ſit at home in quiet. But ſuppoſe ſome bee ſo ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne as to ſtand to the triall, yet can this cunning knaue declare a <hi>Tam quam</hi> againſt them, ſo that though they bee cléered, yet can they haue no recompence at all, for that he
<pb facs="tcp:6189:18"/>
doth it in the Courts behalfe, I will not vnfold all his vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, but he is an abuſer of good lawes and a very knaue, and ſo let him be, with his fellowes. I both wondred and laught to heare Clothbreeches make this diſcourſe, when I ſaw two in the valley togither by the eares, the one in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the other as blacke as the Deuill: I ſtept to them to part the fray, and queſtioned what they were, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they brawled: Marry, quoth he, that lookt like Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, though I am blacke I am not the Deuill, but indéede a Collier of Croyden, and one ſir that haue ſold many a man a falſe ſacke of coales, that both wanted meaſure and was halfe full of duſt and droſſe. Indeed I haue béene a lieger in my time in London, and haue plaied many mad prankes for which cauſe, you may ſee I am made a curtall, for the Pillorie hath eaten off both my eares, and nowe ſir this ropemaker hunteth me here with his halters, I geſſe him to be ſome euill ſpirit, that in the likeneſſe of a man woulde ſince I haue paſt the pillory perſwade me to hang my ſelf for my old offenſes, and therefore ſithe I cannot bleſſe mee from him with <hi>Nomine patris,</hi> I laye <hi>Spiritus ſanctus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his ſhoulders with a cudgell, that he may get out of my companie. The ropemaker replied, that honeſtly iourney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng by the way, he acquainted himſelfe with the Colliar, &amp; for no other cauſe pretended. And whether are you a going <abbr>qd</abbr>, I? Marry ſir <abbr>qd</abbr> he, firſt to abſolue your queſtion, I dwel in Saffron Waldon, and am going to Cambridge to three ſons that I kéep there at ſchoole, ſuch apt children ſir as few women haue groned for, and yet they haue ill lucke. The one ſir is a Deuine to comfort my ſoule, &amp; he indeed though he be a vaine glorious aſſe, as diuers youths of his age bee, is well giuen to the ſhew of the world, and writte a late the lambe of God, and yet his pariſhioners ſay he is the limb of the deuill, and kiſſeth their wiues with holy kiſſes, but they had rather he ſhould kéep his lips for madge his mare. The ſecond ſir, is a Phyſitian or a foole, but indéed a phyſitian, &amp; had proued a proper man if he had not ſpoiled himſelfe with his Aſtrological diſcourſe of the terrible coniunction of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
<pb facs="tcp:6189:18"/>
and Iupiter. For the eldeſt, he is a Ciuilian, a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous witted fellow, ſir reuerence ſir, he is a Doctor,<note place="margin">Such a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard by S.

Honeſt with the deuil <abbr>qd</abbr> the Colliar, How can he be honeſt, whoſe mother I geſſe was a witch. For I haue heard them ſay, that witches ſay their praiers backward, and ſo doth the ropemaker yerne his liuing by going backward, and the knaues chéefe liuing is by making fatal inſtruments, as halters and ropes, which diuers deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate men hang themſelues with. Well <abbr>qd</abbr> 
               <hi>I,</hi> what ſay you to theſe, ſhal they be on the Iury? Veluet bréeches ſaid nothing, but Cloth bréeches ſaid, in the ropemaker he found no great falſhood in him, therfore he was willing he ſhould be one, but for the Colliar he thought it neceſſary that as he came ſo he ſhould depart, ſo then <hi>I</hi> bad the ropemaker ſtand by til more came, which was not long. For there came <hi>3.</hi> in a cluſter. Aſſoon as they drewnie, <hi>I</hi> ſpied one, a fat churl with a ſide ruſſet cote to his knee, and his hands all to tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſhifting his Ouſe, yet woulde I not take notice what they were, but queſtioned them their occupations. Marry <abbr>qd</abbr> the firſt, I am a tanner, the ſecond a ſhoomaker, the third a Currier: then turning to the plaintife and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, <hi>I</hi> aſked them if they would allow of thoſe parties. No by my faith <abbr>qd</abbr> Clothbréeches, <hi>I</hi> make challenge vnto them al, and <hi>I</hi> wil yéeld reaſons of import againſt them, &amp; firſt to you M. Tanner. Are you a man worthy to be on a iurie, when your conſcience eares not to wrong the whole Commonwealth? you reſpect not publike commodity, but priuate gaines: not to benefite your neighbour, but for to make the proude princocxe your ſonne an vpſtart Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and bicauſe you would marrie your Daughter at the leaſt to an Eſquire, that ſhe may if it be poſſible, be a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman,
<pb facs="tcp:6189:19"/>
and how comes this to paſſe, by your Tan-fats forſooth: For whereas by the ſtatutes of Englande you ſhould let a hide lie in the Ouſe at the leaſt nine monethes, you can make good leather of it before thrée monethes, you haue your Doues doong, your marle, your Aſhen barke, and a thouſand thinges more, to bring on your leather apace, that it is ſo badly tanned, that when it comes to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, then it fléetes away like a péece of browne paper: and whereas your backs of all other ſhould be beſt tanned, you bring them ſo full of horne to the market, that did you not greaſe the ſealers of Leaden Hall thoroughly in the fiſte, they ſhould neuer be ſealed, but turned away and made for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit by the ſtatute. I cannot at large lay open your ſubtile practiſes to beguile the poore communalitie with badde lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But let this ſuffiſe, you leaue no villainie vnſought, to bring the blockhead your ſonne to goe afore the Clowne his father, trimlye trickt vppe in a paire of veluet bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
            <p>Nowe maiſter Currier to your cooſenage, you cannot be content only to burne the Leather you dreſſe for fault of liquor, bicauſe you would make the ſhoomaker pay wel and you put in little ſtuffe: and beſide, when as in backes you ſhould only put in Tallow hard and good, you put in ſofte kitchin ſtuffe mixt, and ſo make the good and well tanned Leather by your villanie to fleet and waſte away, but alſo you grow to be an extorting knaue and a foreſtaller of the market. For you will buye Leather, ſides, backes, and Calues ſkinnes, and ſel them to poore ſhomakers at an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable rate, by your falſe retailing, getting infinite goods by that exceſſiue price: both vndooing the poore ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, and cauſing vs that wee pay extreamely for ſhooes. For if the Currier bought not Leather by the whole of the Tanner, the ſhoomaker might haue it at a more reaſonable price: but the ſhoomaker beeing poore, is not perhaps able to deale with a dicker of Hides, nor perhaps with a couple of backs, and the Tanner will not truſt him: then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torting and cooſening Currier coms vppe with this, I will
<pb facs="tcp:6189:19"/>
lend you for a day and ſo pincheth him, that he is ſearce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to finde his children bread. But well hath the Prince and the Honorable Lords of the priuie Counſaile prouided by Act of Parliament, that no Currier ſhall buy leather ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hides or backs of the Tanner, ſo to bridle the extorting and foreſtalling cooſenage, but craftilyer and ſubteller hath the knaue Currier croſbitten the ſtatute, in that hee deales thus with the Tanner, he makes him holde his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnreaſonably to the ſhoomaker, and ſo when he cannot ſell it, he laies it vp in the Curriers houſe, vnder a colour whereas indeed he hath ſold it him. Suppoſe this ſhifte be ſpied and preuented: then compoundeth he with ſom knaue ſhoomaker, ſome baſe rakehell without a conſcience, that neither reſpecteth God, the Commonwealth, nor his Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panie, and forſooth he is halfe with the Currier, whoe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him haue ſome hundreth marke to laye out for leather euery month, whereas he ſpends not in his ſhop a hundred marks worth in a yeere: ſo the ſhoomaker buies it to abuſe the ſtatute for the Currier, and the Currier by that means vndooeth the other ſhoomakers: thus two crafty knaues are met and they need no broker.</p>
            <p>Now to you gentle craft, you maſſe ſhoomaker: you can put in the inner ſole, of a thin Calues ſkin, when as the ſhoo is a neates leather ſhoo, which you know is cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie both to conſcience and the ſtatute. Beſide, you will ioine a neates leather vampey to a calues leather héele: is not héere good ſtuffe maiſter ſhomaker. Well for your knaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, you ſhall haue theſe curſſes which belongs vnto your craft: you ſhall be light footed to trauell farre, light witted vpon euery ſmall occaſion to giue your maiſters the bagge, you ſhall bee moſt of you vnthriftes, and almoſt all perfect goodfellows. Beſide I remember a meryieſt how S. <hi>Peter</hi> brought you to a dangerous diſeaſe, for he requeſted a boon for you, which fell out to your great diſaduantage, and to recreat vs a litle héere Gentle craft, what fel to your trade by that holy ſaint. It chanced that on a day, ſaint <hi>Peter</hi> and Chriſt walking togither, <hi>Peter</hi> was wonderfully hungry,
<pb facs="tcp:6189:20"/>
and had no money in his purſſe to buy him any foode, and at laſt to his great comfort he eſpied where a companye of Taylors were at Dinner with buttred peaſe, eating theyr peaſe with their needles pointes one by one: ſaint Peter came to them and aſked them his almes, they proudly bad him ſit downe and doo as he ſaw they did, and with that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered him a néedle. The poore ſaint being paſſing hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, could not content his mawe with eating one by one, but turned the eie of his néedle and eate two or three togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which the Taylors ſeeing, they ſtart vppe and ſaide, What fellow: a ſhouell and a ſpade to butterd peaſe, haſt thou no more manners? Get out of our companie, and ſo they ſent him packing with many ſtroakes. <hi>Peter</hi> comming backe, Chriſt demanded of him what newes: and he tolde him how churliſhlye he was vſed amongſt the Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors. Well, wandering on further, <hi>Peter</hi> eſpied where a company of ſhoomakers were at Dinner, with powdered beefe &amp; breweſſe, going to them before he coulde aſke them any almes, they ſaid, welcome good fellowe, What is thy ſtomach vppe, wilt thou doo as we doo, and taſte of beefe? ſaint <hi>Peter</hi> thanked them and ſat downe and eate his belly full, and dranke well of good double beere, And when hee had doone went home to his maiſter. Aſſoone as he came Chriſt aſked him what newes, and he ſaid: Oh mayſter, I haue lighted amongſt a crue of ſhooemakers, the beſte fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that euer I met withall, they haue franklie fed mee without grudging, and therefore maiſter grant me a boone for them. Aſke what thou wilt <hi>Peter,</hi> quoth he, and it ſhal be doone? Why then Lord, quoth he, graunt that for thys good turne they haue doone mee. they may euer ſpende a groat afore they can yearn two pence. It ſhall be granted quoth he. <hi>Peter</hi> aſſoone as Chriſt had ſaid the worde, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelfe and ſaid: Nay Lorde, but that they maye yearne a groat afore they ſpend two pence, for my tongue ſlipt at the firſt. Well <hi>Peter</hi> quoth he, it cannot be recald the firſt wiſh muſt ſtand, and heereof by ſaint <hi>Peters</hi> boone it grew, that all of the Gentle craft are ſuch good fellowes
<pb facs="tcp:6189:20"/>
&amp; ſpendthriftes. But howſoeuer, none of thoſe thrée, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhoomaker, Tanner, nor Currier, ſhall be accepted to be of the Iury.</p>
            <p>As they went away with fleas in their eares, beeing thus taunted by Cloth bréeches, we might ſee where there came a troupe of antient Gentlemen, with their ſeruinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men attending vpon them. The foremoſt was a great old man, with a white bearde all in ruſſet, and a faire blacke cloke on his backe, and attending on him hee had ſome fiue men, there cogniſance as I remember was a Peacocke without a tayle, the other two that accompanied him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med meaner then himſelfe, But yet Gentlemen of good worſhip. Wherevppon I went towards them, and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, and was ſo bould as to queſtion what they were, and of their buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>The moſt antienteſt anſwered hee was a Knight, and thoſe two his neighbours, the one an Eſquire, the other a Gentleman, and that they haue no vrgent affaires, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to walke abroad to take the freſh ayre. Then did I ſhew them both Cloth breeches, and Veluet breeches, and tolde them the controuerſie, and deſired their ayde to be vpon the Iurie. They ſmiling anſwered, They were content, and ſo did Cloth breeches ſeeme to reioice, that ſuche honeſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, Engliſh Gentlemen ſhould be tryers of his Tytle, But Veluet breeches ſtorming, ſtept in and made challeng to them all. <hi>I</hi> demanded the reaſon why he ſhoulde refuſe Gentlemen of ſo good calling? And he made me this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. Why you may geſſe the inward mind by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward apparel and ſee how he is adicted by the homly robes he is ſuted in. Why this knight is mortal enimy to pride &amp; ſo to me: he regardeth hoſpitality and aimeth at honor with releeuing the poore, you may ſee although his landes and reuenewes be great, and he able to maintaine himſelfe in great brauerie, yet he is content with homeſpun cloth, and ſcorneth the pride that is vſed nowadaies amongeſt yoong vpſtartes, he houldeth not the worth of his Gentrie to bee and conſiſt in Veluet breeches, but valeweth true fame by
<pb facs="tcp:6189:21"/>
the report of the common ſort whoe praiſe him for his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Iuſtice, liberality, houſekeeping and almeſdeedes, <hi>Vox populi vox dei,</hi> his tennants and Farmers woulde if it might be poſſible, make him immortall with their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and praiſes. He raiſeth no rent, racketh no landes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no incumbs, impoſeth no mercileſſe fines, enuies not an other, buyeth no houſe ouer his neighbours head: but reſpecteth his country and the commodity thereof, as deere as his life. He regardeth more to haue the needy fedde, to haue his boorde garniſhed with full platters, then to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous himſelfe with exceſſiue furniture in apparell. Since then he ſcorneth pride, he muſt of force proclaime himſelfe mine enimie, and therefore he ſhall be none of my Iurie, and ſuch as himſelfe I geſſe the Squire and the gentleman and therefore I challenge them al thrée. Why quoth I, this is ſtrange, that a man ſhould be drawne from a queſt for his godlineſſe. If men for vertue be challenged, whome ſhall we haue vppon the Iury? Your obiection helpes not maiſter Veluet bréeches: For if he be a man of ſo godlye a diſpoſition, he will neither ſpeake for feare or fauour, hee will regard neither the riches of the one, nor the plaine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie of the other. Wherevpon ſith you haue made mee trier, I allowe them all thrée to bee of the Iurie, and ſo I requeſted them to ſit downe till our Iury was full, which they courteouſly did, although veluet bréeches frouned at it. When I looking for more, ſaw where there came a troope of men, in apparell ſéeming poore honeſt Citizens, in all they were eight. I demaunded of them what they were, and whither they were going. One of them that ſéemed the welthieſt, who was in a furred Iacket made anſwere, that they were all friends going to the burial of a neighbor of theirs, that yeſter night died, and if would doo mee anye pleaſure to heare their names, they were not ſo daintie but that they would tell them, and ſo then he began to tell mee, that by his Art he was a Skinner, the ſecond ſaid hee was a Ioyner, the thirde was a Sadler, the fourth a waterman, the fifte was a Cutler, the ſixt was a Bellows mender, the
<pb facs="tcp:6189:21"/>
ſeuenth a plaiſterer, and the eight a Printer. In good time quoth I, it is commendable when neighbours loue ſo well together, but if your ſpéed be not ouermuch, I muſt requeſt you to be of a iurie, ſo I diſcourſt vnto them the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie betwéen Clothbréeches and Veluetbréeches, and to what iſſue it muſt grow by a verdict, they ſéemed all content, and I turned to the plaintiffe and defendant, and aſked if they would make challenge to any of theſe. I ſkorne <abbr>qd</abbr> Veluet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bréeches, to make any great obiection agaynſt them, ſith they be mecanical men, and I almoſt hold them indifferent for this I know, they get as much and more by me than by him, the ſkinner I vſe for furres, whereas this baſe cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bréeches hath ſcarſe a gowne faced once in his life, the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler for coſtly imbroidered ſaddles, the ioyner for ſéeling my houſe, the cutler for gylt rapyers, the waterman I vſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, ten times for his once, and ſo likewiſe the plaiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, for the bellowſmender alas poore ſnake I knowe him not, for the Printer by our Lady I think I am ſome tenne pounds in his debt for bookes, ſo that for my part let them all paſſe. And for me to, <abbr>qd</abbr> Clothbréeches, but yet a little to put them in remembrance of their folies, let me haue about with them all, and firſt with you maiſſer ſkinner, to whom I can ſay little but only this, that whereas you ſhould only put the backs of ſkins into facing, you taw the wombs and ſo deceiue the buier, beſide if you haue ſome fantaſtike ſkin brought you not woorth two pence, with ſome ſtrange ſpots though it be of a libbet, you will ſweare tis a moſt pretious ſkin, and came from <hi>Muſco</hi> or the furtheſt parts of <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria.</hi> The Sadler he ſtuffes his pannels with ſtraw or hay and ouerglaſeth them with haire, and makes the lether of them of morts, or tand ſhéeps ſkinnes. The ioyner though an honeſt man, yet he maketh his ioynts weake, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in ſappe in the morteſes which ſhould be the hart of the trée, and all to make his ſtuffe ſlender. And you cutler, you are patron of ruffions and ſwaſhbucklers, and wil ſel them a blade that may be thruſt into a buſhell, but if a poore man that cannot ſkill of it you ſell him a ſwoorde or rapier newe
<pb facs="tcp:6189:22"/>
ouerglaſed, and ſweare the blade came either from Turkie or Toledo. Now maiſter Waterman you will ſay there is no ſubtiltie in you, for there is none ſo ſimple but that knowes your fares and what is due betwéene Greenwiche and London, and how you earn your mony painfully with the ſweat of your browes, all this is true, but let mee whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per one thing in your eare, you will play the goodfellow too much if you be well greaſed in the fiſt, for if a yoong Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman and a pretie wench come to you and ſaye, Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, my friend and I mean to go by water and to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a night or two, I care not which way nor whether wée go, and therefore where thou thinkeſt wee maye haue beſt lodging thither carrie vs: then off goes your cap and away they goe, to Brainfoord or ſome other place, and then you ſay, Hoſteſſe I pray you vſe this Gentleman and his wyfe wel, they are come out of London to take the aire and mean to be merrie here a night or two, and to ſpend their monye frankly, when God wot they are neither man nor wife, nor perhaps of any acquaintance before their matche made in ſome bawdie tauerne, but you know no ſuch matter, and therefore waterman I pardon you. And for you plaiſterer and bellowſmender I paſſe you ouer and ſo do I the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to, only this I muſt néedes ſay to him that ſome of his trade will print lewd books, and bawdy pamphlets (by M.<hi>R.G.</hi>) but <hi>Auri ſacra fauores quid non,</hi> and therefore I am content they ſhall be all of the iurie. I was glad there were ſo many accepted of at once, &amp; hoped that now quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the iurie would be ful, looking about me, ſtraight <hi>I</hi> might ſee one alone come running as faſt as he could, I woondred what he ſhould be that he made ſuch haſt, and the Skinner told me he was an honeſt man, and one of their companye, by his occupation a bricklaier. Oh <abbr>qd</abbr> veluetbréeches, a good honeſt ſimple man, hee hath bin long in my worke in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me a ſumptuous houſe. But I challenge him, <abbr>qd</abbr> cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bréeches, for he is a iugler. How <abbr>qd</abbr> I can it be, ſée he goeth very homely in leather and hath his ruler in his hande and his trowel at his ſide, and he ſéemeth not as one that were
<pb facs="tcp:6189:22"/>
giuen to ſuch qualities. Yes (quoth clothbréeches) hee hath this policie, when he maketh a ſtately place all glorious to the eye and ful of faire chambers and goodly roomes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the houſe perhaps ſome thréeſcore chimnies, yet he can ſo cunningly caſt by his arte that three of them ſhall not ſmoke in the tweluemonth, and ſo ſpoiles hee much good morter &amp; bricke. Why <abbr>qd</abbr> I, the fault is not in the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man but the houſekeeper, for now adaies men builde for to pleaſe the eye not to profit the poore, they vſe no roſt, but for themſelues and their houſhold, nor no fire but in a little court chunnie in their owne chamber, howe can the poore bricklaier then be blamed, when the niggardneſſe of the Lord or maiſter is the cauſe no more chimnies doe ſmoke, for would they vſe auntient hoſpitality as their forefathers did, and value as lightly of pride as their greate graundfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then ſhould you ſee euery chimny in the houſe ſmoke, and prooue that the poore Artificer had doone his part. Why then <abbr>qd</abbr> Clothbreeches as you pleaſe, admit him on the queſt. But what be theſe <abbr>qd</abbr> Clothbreeches, that come here ſo ſoberly? <hi>I</hi> hope they be honeſt men, for they looke ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry demure, <hi>I</hi> will inquire ſayd <hi>I,</hi> and with that ſtepping to them, <hi>I</hi> demaunded their names and very courtiouſlye the one ſayd he was a brewer, the other a butcher, the thirde a baker, and the fourth a vitler. Hearing what they were, I was glad, gheſſing ſith they were ſo honeſt ſubſtantial men that they would helpe to make vp the iurie, when Veluet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bréeches with a grim and ſower countenaunce gaue them this challenge. I hold it not neceſſarie (quoth hee) that theſe haue any thing to deale in my cauſe, ſith I am at oddes with them al at leaſt in fortie pounds a péece, for this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yeares I haue bene indebted vnto them for bread, beefe, beare and other victuals, then ſith they haue credited mée long, and I haue had ſo little care to paye them, I doubte now they will reuenge themſelues and paſſe againſt me in the verdicte. Nay (quoth <hi>I</hi>) the rather wil they hold on your part, for if they bee honeſt wiſe men (as they ſéeme to bee) they will bee carefull of your prefermente, ſeeing
<pb facs="tcp:6189:23"/>
the more highly they are aduaunſt, the more like are they to come by their owne. If therefore you can obiect no other points of diſhoneſty againſt them, I ſée no reaſon why they ſhould be put by. If you doe not (<abbr>qd</abbr> clothbréeches) then here me and I will prooue them vnfit to haue any dealings here, and firſt for the Butcher. I praye you goodman kilcalfe, what hauocke play you with puffing vp of meat, and blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with your prickar as you flea it, haue you not your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall knaueries to ſet out your meate with prickes, and then ſweare he hath more for monie than euer you bought, to ſell a péece of an olde Cow for a chop of a yoong Oxe, to waſh your old meat that hath hung weltring in the ſhoppe with new blood, to truſſe away an olde eaw in ſtead of a yoong weather, and although you knowe it is hurtfull and forbidden by ſtatutes to flea your hides, ſkins, and backes, with cuts and ſlaſhes to the impoueriſhing of the pore ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker when he buies it, yet I pray you how many flaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe you make in a poore Calues ſkinne? Oh Butcher, a long lent be your puniſhment, for you make no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in deceiuing the poore. And you maſt Brewer that grow to be woorth forty thouſand pounds by ſelling of ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den water, what ſubtiltie haue you in making your beare to ſpare the malt and put in the more of the hoppe to make your drink (be barly neuer ſo cheap) not a whit the ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger and yet neuer ſell a whit the more meaſure for monie, you can when you haue taken all the harte of the malt awaye, then clap on ſtore of water tis cheape ynough, and maſhe out a tunning of ſmall beare, ſo thin that it ſcoures a mans maw like renniſh wine: in your conſcience how many bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels draw you out of a quarter of malt, fie, fie, I conceale your falſhood, leaſt I ſhould bee too broad in ſetting downe your faults. And as for you goodman Baker, that delight to be ſéen where moſt people reſort, euen on the pillory in the chéefe market place, the world cries out of your wilineſſe, you craue but one dere yere to make your daughter a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, you buy your corne at the beſt hande, and yet will not be content to make your bread weight, you put in

Laſt to you Tom tapſter, that tap your ſmall cannes of beare to the poore, and yet fill them halfe full of froth that card your beare (if you ſee your gueſts begin to be drunke) halfe ſmall and halfe ſtrong, you cannot bee content to pinch with your ſmall pottes and your Oſtrie faggots: but you haue your trugges to draw men on to villanie, and to bring cuſtomers to your houſe, where you ſell a ioint of meat for xii. pence that coſt you ſcarſe ſix, and if any chaunce to go on the ſkore you ſkore him when he is a ſléepe, and ſet vp a grote a daye more than he hath, to find you drinking pots with your com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panions, to be ſhort, thou art a knaue, and I like not of any of the reſt, the way lies before you, and therefore you maye be gone for you ſhall be none of the queſt. I ſmilde to ſee Clothbreeches ſo peremptory, when I ſaw fiue fat fellowes all in damaſke cotes and gowns welted with Veluet very braue, and in great conſultation, as if they were to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of ſome waighty matter, drawing neere I ſawe they were welthy citizens, ſo I went &amp; reuerently ſaluted them, and told them how we needed their aid about the appeaſing of a controuerſie, ſhewing them where the knighte, eſquier, and other ſtaid, til we might find men to fil vp the iury, they were contented, but veluetbreeches excepted againſte foure of them and ſayd they wer none of his friends, that was the marchant, goldſmith, mercer and draper, his allegations were theſe, that they were al feathered of one wing to fetch in yong gentlemen by commodities vnder the colour of len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of monie: for the merchant he deliuered the yron, tin, lead, hops, ſugars, ſpices, oiles, browne paper or whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer elſe from ſix months to ſix mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ths, which when the pore

The mercer he fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loweth the yoong vpſtart gentleman that hath no gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelfe, and he feedeth his humor to go braue, hée ſhall not want ſilkes, ſattins, veluets, to prank<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> abroade in his pomp, but with this prouiſo, that he muſt bind ouer his land in a ſtatute marchant or ſtaple, and ſo at laſt forfeit al vnto the mercileſſe mercer, and leaue himſelfe neuer a foot of ground in England, which is the reaſon that for a fewe remnaunts of veluets and ſilkes the Mercer créepeth into whole lordſhips. The Goldſmith is not behinde, for moſt of them deale with Vſurie, and let yoong gentlemen haue commodities of plate for ten in the hundred, but they muſt looſe the faſion in ſelling it agayne (which cuts them ſore) beſide they are moſt of them ſkild in alcumie and can tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per mettals ſhrewdly, with no little profite to themſelues and diſaduauntage to the buier, beſide puffe ringes, and quaint conceits which I omit. And ſo for you Draper, hée fetcheth them off for liuery cloth, and cloth for ſix months and ſix, and yet hath he more knacks in his budget, for hee hath ſo darke a ſhop that no man can well chooſe a peece of cloth it ſo ſhadowes the die and the thread, a man ſhall bee deceiued in the wooll and the nappe, they cauſe the Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worker ſo to preſſe them, beſides he impoſeth this charge to the Clothworker that he draw his cloth and pull it paſſing hard when he ſets it vpon the tenters, that he maye haue it full breadth and length, till thread and all teare and rent a péeces, what care they for that, haue they not a drawer to ſerue their turne to drawe and ſeame vp the holes ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly that it ſhall neuer be eſpied? my ſelfe haue ſeene in one broad cloth eightéene ſcore holes torne rackt and pulde by the Clothworker<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only to pleaſe the draper and deceyue the commonwealth. To be ſhort, the Clothworker what with rowing and ſetting in a fine nap, with powdering it &amp; preſſing it, with ſhering the wooll to the proofe of the thread, deale ſo cunningly that they proue themſelues the drapers miniſter to execute his ſubtilties, therefore if he chaunce to

Why no <abbr>qd</abbr> clothbreeches <hi>I</hi> am of another mind, for <hi>I</hi> hold him as deceitfull as any of the reſt, what the vintner, why he is a kind of Negromancer, for at midnight when al men are in bed then he forſooth fals to his charmes and ſpels, ſo that he tumbles one hogſhead into another, and can make a cup of claret that hath loſt his colour looke high with a daſh of red wine at his pleaſure, if hee hath a ſtrong Gaſcoigne wine, for feare it ſhould make his gueſts to ſoone drunke, hee can allaye it with a ſmall Rochell wine: hee can cheriſh vp white wine with ſacke, and perhaps if you bidde him waſh the pot cleane when he goes to draw you a quart of wine he will leaue a litle water in the bottome, and then draw it vp full of wine, and what and if he do? tis no harm wine and water is good againſt the heate of the liuer. It were infinite to rehearſe the iugling of Vintners, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of their houſes, eſpetially of the perſons that frequent them, and therefore ſith Veluetbreeches hath put by the merchant, goldſmith, mercer &amp; draper, the vintner ſhal goe with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for company. As theſe were going away in a ſnuff for being thus plainly taunted, wee might ſee a mad merrie crue come leping ouer the field as frolikly as if they ought not all the world two pence, and drawing nearer we might perceiue that either bottle-ale or béere had made a fraye with them, for the lifting of their féet ſhewed the lightneſſe of their heads, the formoſt was a plaine country ſir Iohn, or vickar that proclaimed by the rednes of his noſe he did oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner go into the alehouſe than the pulpit, &amp; him <hi>I</hi> aſked what they were and whether they were going: what are you <abbr>qd</abbr> the prieſt that ſtand by the high way to examin me and my friends, heres none in my company but are able to anſwer for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. I ſéeing they were al ſet on a merry pin, tolde him the cauſe &amp; how the controuerſie grew betwixt Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bréeches &amp; veluetbreeches &amp; that we needed them to be of the queſt.

For the Carpenter, Glouer, and Waterbearer, the Huſbandman, Dier, and Sailor, ſith you trades haue but petty ſleights, ſtand you with Mai. Vicar, you are like to helpe to giue in the verdict: but for the pedler and the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, they are two notable knaues, both of a haire, and both coſen Germaines to the Deuill. For the Tinker, why he is a drowſie, bawdy, drunken companion, that walkes vppe and downe with a trug after him, and in ſtopping one hole makes three: and if in conuenient place he méetes with one alone, perhaps riſle him or hir of all that euer they haue. A baſe knaue without feare of God or loue to any one but to his whore and to himſelfe.

pence, and that you carrie your packe but for a coulour to ſhadow your other villanies. Well howeſoeuer, you are both knaues and ſo be iogging. Well quoth I, ſuppoſe the Iurie is almoſt full, I beleeue we want not aboue three or foure perſons: Looke you where they come to make vppe the number, and they ſhould be men of good diſpoſition, for they ſeeme to be all of the Countrey. Aſſoone as they came to vs I met them, and told them the matter, and they wer content. The one ſaid he was a Graſier, the other a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the other ſhepheard to them both. What thinke you of theſe three quoth I? Marry ſaith Veluet breeches, twoe of them are honeſt men, but the other is a baſe knaue: but tis no matter, ſhuffle him in amongeſt the reſt. Naye by your leaue <abbr>qd</abbr> Cloth breeches, I wil ſhuffle out theſe two, for they are the very Cormorants of the Countrey, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure the poore people with their monſterous exactions. And firſt I alledge againſt the Graſier, that he foreſtalleth paſtures and medow grounds, for the feeding of his cattell, and wringeth leaſes of them out of poore mens handes, and in his buyeng of cattell he committeth great vſurie, for if it proue a wet yeare, then hee maketh hauocke and ſelleth deere: if it be a drie yeare, then hee buyeth cheape, and yet hauing paſture keepes them till he may come to his owne priſe: he knoweth as well as the Butcher by the feede of a bullocke how much Tallow he will yeelde, what his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters will amount vnto: what the Tanner wil giue for the Hide: Nay, what the ſowſe wiues were able to make of the inwards: ſo that he ſels it ſo déere to the Butcher, that he can ſcarſe liue of it: and therfore what ſubtlety the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher vſeth, commeth from the Graſier, ſo that I exempt him from the queſt as a bad member, and an ill friend to Cloth breeches. And for you maſſ. Farmer, you knowe how tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough you couetiſe Landelordes raiſe their rentes, for if a poore man haue but a plough land, if you ſee his paſtures beare good graſſe, and his earable ground good corne, and that he proſpereth and goeth forwarde on it and prouideth and maintaineth his wife and ſeruants honeſtly, then <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidus

            </p>
            <p>Then ſtraight enuie pricks the farmer forward, and he bids the Landelord farre more then the poore man paies yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie for it: ſo that if he be a Tenant at will, he puts him out to begge in the ſtreet: or when his leaſe comes out he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loades him in the fine, and thus bloudſucketh he the poore for his owne priuate profit. Beſides the baſe chuffe if hee ſées a forward yeare and that corne is like to be plenty, then he murmureth againſt God, and ſweareth and proteſteth he ſhall be vndoone: reſpecting more the filling of his owne coffers by a dearth, then the profit of his countrey by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall plenty. Beſides ſir may it pleaſe you, when newe corne comes into the market, who bringes in to relieue the ſtate? Not your maiſterſhip, but the poore huſbandman, that wants pence. For you kéepe it to the backe end of the yeare, nay you haue your Garners which haue corne of two or thrée yeare old, vpon hope ſtill of a deare yeare, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther letting the Weaſels eate it, then the poore ſhould haue it at any reaſonable price. So that I conclude, you are a Cormorant of the common wealth, and a wretch that liues of the ſpoile of the néedie, and ſo I leaue you to iet with the Graſier. Marry for the ſhepheard, vnleſſe it be that he kil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth a Lambe now and then, and ſaies the Fox ſtole him, I know little craft in his budget, therefore let him be among the honeſt men of the Iurie.</p>
            <p>Well Cloth breeches quoth I, you are very peremptory in your challenges, what ſay you here comes <hi>3.</hi> or <hi>4.</hi> City<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, wil any of theſe ſerue turne? I cannot tel <abbr>qd</abbr> he till I know their names and conditions. With that I ſtept afore the company, and inquired what they were. The eldeſt of them being a graue Citizen, ſaid he was a Grocer, the reſt his good and honeſt neighbors, a Chandler, a Haberdaſher, a Clothworker, and two ſtrangers, one a Wallon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Dutchman. How like you of theſe quoth <hi>I</hi> to Veluet bréeches? well enough quoth he, for <hi>I</hi> am little acquainted with them, yet <hi>I</hi> know they fauour me, bicauſe <hi>I</hi> haue on a
<pb facs="tcp:6189:27"/>
ſunday ſéene them all in their ſilkes. I marry, quoth cloth bréeches, but they neuer get that brauery with honeſtie, For the cloth worker his faultes were laide open, Before when we had the Draper in queſtion: and therefore let him bee packing. For you Chandler, I like not of your tricks; you are to conuerſant with the kitchen ſtuffe wiues you after your weeke or ſnaft is ſtiffened, you dip it in fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy droſſe, and after giue him a coat of good tallowe, which makes the Candles drop and waſt away, to the great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of the poore workeman that watcheth in the night. Beſide you pinch in your waights and haue falſe meſures, and many other knaueries that I omit, but this be ſure you ſhall not meddle in my matter: neyther the Haberdaſher, For he trims vppe olde felts and makes them verye fayre to the eie, and faceth and edgeth them neatly, and then hee turnes them away to ſuch a ſimple man as I am: and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſeth vs with his cooſenage. Beſide you buy gumd taffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, wherewith you line hats that will ſtraight aſſunder as ſoone as it comes to the heate of a mans head. To be breefe, I am not well ſkild in your knaueries, but indéed you are to ſubtle for poore Cloth bréeches, and therefore you ſhal be none of the Iurie. Marrye the Grocer ſeemes an honeſt man, and I am content to admit of him, only take this as a caueat by the way, that you buy of the Garbellers of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the refuſe that they ſifte from the marchant, and that you mix againe and ſell it to your cuſtomers. Beſides, in your beaten ſpices, as in pepper, you put in Bay berries, and ſuch droſſe, and ſo wring the poore, but theſe are ſleight cauſes and ſo I ouerpaſſe them, and vouchſafe you to be of the queſt.</p>
            <p>But I pray you what be thoſe two honeſt men, <abbr>qd</abbr> the Grocer, The one a Dutchman and a ſhoomaker, the other a Frenchman and a Myllaner in ſaint Martins, and ſels ſhirts, bandes, bracelets, Iewels, and ſuch pretty toies for Gentlewomen: oh they be of veluet bréeches acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, vpſtarts as well as he, that haue brought with them pride and abuſes into England: and firſt to the Millainer. What
<pb facs="tcp:6189:27"/>
toies deuiſeth he to feed the humor of the vpſtart Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man withall, and of fond Gentlewomen? ſuch fannes, ſuch ouches, ſuch brooches, ſuch bracelets, ſuch graundcies, ſuch periwigs, ſuch paintings, ſuch ruffes and cufs, as hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt made England as full of proud fopperies as <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon</hi> were. There is no Seamſter can make a bande or a ſhirt, ſo well as his wife: and why forſooth? bicauſe the filthy queane weare a craunce and is a Frenchwoman for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth. Where as our Engliſh women of the Exchange, are both better workwomen, &amp; wil affoord a better peniworth. And ſo for the drunken Dutchman, this ſhoomaker, he and ſuch as he is, abuſeth the Common wealth, and the poore mechanicall men and handicrafts men of London, for our new vpſtart fooles of Veluet breeches fraternity, liketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that the outlandiſh Aſſe maketh. They like no ſhoo ſo well as the Dutchman maketh, when our Engliſhe men paſſe them farre. And ſo for Chandlers, and all other occupations, they are wronged by the Dutch and French. And therefore ſith the Commons hates them, they cannot be my friends, and therefore let them be launching to Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, for they ſhall be no triers of my controuerſie. Well quoth I, now I ſuppoſe the Iury is ful, and we ſee no more comming, let vs call them and ſee how many we haue. So they appeared to their names, as followeth.</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6189:28"/>What is it not poſſible quoth I, to haue one more to make vp the foure and twenty? As I was thus ſpeaking, I eſpied a far off, a certeine kind of an ouerworne Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man attired in Veluet and ſattyn, but it was ſomewhat dropped and greaſie, and bootes on his legges, whoſe ſoles waxed thin ſeemed to complaine of their Maiſter which treading thrift vnder his féet, had brought them vnto that conſumption, he walked not as other men in the Common beaten waye, but came compaſſing <hi>Circum circa,</hi> as if we had béene Deuils, and he woulde drawe a Circle about vs, and at euery third ſteppe he looked backe, as if hee were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde of a Bayly or a ſergeant.</p>
            <p>After him followed two pert Appleſquires, The one had a Murrey Cloth gowne on, faced downe before with gray Cunnie, and laid thick on the ſleeues with lace, which he quaintly bare vppe, to ſhew his white Taffata hoſe and blacke ſilke ſtockings, a huge ruffe about his necke wrapt in his great head like a wicker Cage, a little hatte with brimmes like the wings of a doublet, wherein hee wore a Iewell of glaſſe, as broad as the Chancery ſeale: after him followed two boies in clokes like butter flies, carrieng one of them his cutting ſword of choller, the other his daunſing rapier of delight. His Camerard that bare him company was a iollie light timberd Iacke a Napes, in a ſute of wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet Taffata cut to the ſkinne, with a cloke al to be dawbed with colourd lace: both he and my gowned brother ſeemed by their paſe as if they had ſome ſutes to mounſieur bootes. At length comming neere, I might diſcerne the firſt to be a Poet, the ſecond a Player, the third a Muſitian, <hi>alias</hi> the Vſher of a Daunſing ſchoole. Well met maiſter Port <abbr>qd</abbr> I, and welcome you friends alſo, though not ſo particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne. So it is, though none of you thrée be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths men, yet vpon vrgent neceſſitye we muſt bee forced to employ you. We haue a Iury to be empanelled immediatly, which one of you thrée muſt helpe to make vp, euen he which approues himſelfe the honeſteſt man. They are all honeſt menne and goodfellowes quoth Veluet bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb facs="tcp:6189:28"/>
therefore it is no great matter whether of them wee chooſe.</p>
            <p>The Doctors doubt of that quoth Cloth bréeches, for I am of a different opinion. This firſt whome by his care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſlouenlie gate at firſt ſight I imagined to be a Poet, is a waſt good and an vnthrift, that hee is borne to make the Tauernes ritch and himſelfe a begger, if he haue fourtye poundes in his purſe togither, he puts it not to vſurie, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buies land nor Marchandize with it, but a monethes commodity of wenches and Capons. Tenne pound a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Why tis nothing, If his plough goes and his inkhorne be cleere: Take one of them worthie twentye thouſande pound and hang him. He is a kinge of his pleaſure, and counts all other Boores and peſants, that though they haue money at command yet know not like him how to Doma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>néere with it to any purpoſe as they ſhould. But to ſpeak plainelie, I thinke him an honeſt man if he would but liue within his compaſſe, and generally no mannes foe but his owne. Therefore I hold him a man fit to be of my Iurie. Nay quoth veluet bréeches, <hi>I</hi> haue more mind to theſe two, for this Poet is a proud fellowe, that bicauſe he hath a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wit in his budget will contemne and diſlike vs that are the Common ſort of Gentlemen, and thinke we are behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to him if he doo but beſtow a faire looke on vs. The plaier and the Vſher of the dauncing ſchoole are plaine, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, humble men, that for a pennie or an olde caſt ſute of apparell. Indeed quoth Cloth bréeches you ſay troth, they are but too humble, for they be ſo lowlie, that they be baſe minded, I meane not in their lookes nor apparell, for ſo they be peacockes and painted aſſes, but in their courſe of life, for they care not howe they get crownes, I meane how baſelie ſo they haue them: and yet of the two I holde the Player to be the better Chriſtian, although he is in his owne imagination, too full of ſelfe liking and ſelfe loue, and is vnfit to be of the Iurie, though <hi>I</hi> hide and concele his faults and fopperies, in that I haue beene merrie at his
<pb facs="tcp:6189:29"/>
ſports, only this I muſt ſay, that ſuche plaine country fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes as my ſelfe they bring in as clownes and fooles to laugh at in their play, whereas they get by vs, and of our almes the prowdeſt of them all dooth liue Well to be breefe let him trot to the ſtage, for he ſhall be none of the iurie. And for you maiſter vſher of the dauncing ſchoole, you are a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into all miſrule, you inſtruct gentlemen to order their féet when you driue them to miſorder their manners, you are a bad fellow that ſtand vpon your tricks and capers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> til you make yoong gentlemen caper without their lands, why ſir to be flat with you, you liue by your legges as a iugler by his hands, you are giuen ouer to the pumps &amp; vanities of the world, and to be ſhort you are a keeper of miſrule and a lewd fellow, and you ſhall be none of the inqueſt. Why then <abbr>qd</abbr> I, you are both agreed that the Poet is hee that muſt make vp the xxiiij? They anſwered both, he, and none but hee. Then I calling them all together, bad them laye their hands on the booke, and firſt I cald the knight, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the reſt as they followed in order, then I gaue them their charge thus. Worſhipfull ſir, with the reſt of the iury whome we haue ſolicited of choice honeſt men, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences will deale vprightly in this controuerſie, you and the reſt of your company are here vpon your oath &amp; oathes to inquire whether Clothbréeches haue done diſſeiſon vnto Veluetbréeches yea or no in or about London, in putting him out of franke tenement, wronging him of his right and imbolliſhing his credit, if you finde that Clothbreeches hath done Veluet bréeches wrong, then let him be ſet in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eſtate and allow him reaſonable dammages. Vpon this they laid their hands on the booke and were ſworne, and departed to ſcrutine of the matter by inquirie amongſt themſelues, not ſtirring out of our ſighte nor ſtaieng long, but ſtraight returned, and the knight for them all as the for moſt, ſaid thus So it is that we haue with equitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience conſidered of this controuerſie betwéene Veluet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breeches and Clothbreeches, as touching the prerogatiue of them both, which are moſt worthy to bee rightlye reſident
<pb facs="tcp:6189:29"/>
and haue ſeiſon in frank tenement here in Englande, and we doe find Clothbreeches is by many hundred yeares more antient, euer ſince <hi>Brute</hi> and inhabitant in this Iland, one that hath ben in <hi>Diebús illis</hi> a companion to kings, an equall with the nobilitie, a friende to gentlemen and yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and a patron of the poore, a true ſubiect, a good houſeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and generall as honeſt as he is auntient. Whereas Veluet bréeches is an vpſtart come out of <hi>Italy,</hi> begot of Pride, nurſed vp by ſelfe-loue, and brought into this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie by his companion new fangleneſſe, that he is but of late time a raiſer of rents, and an enemie in the commonwelth, and one that is not any way to be preferd in equitie before Clothbreeches, therefore by generall verdict wee adiudge Clothbreeches to haue done him no wrong, but that he hath lawfully claimd his title of frank tenement, and in that we appoint him for euer to be reſident. At this verdict pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounſt by the knight, all the ſtanders by clapt their hands, and gaue a mighty ſhout, whereat I ſtarted and awaked, for I was in a dreame and in my bed, and ſo roſe vp, and writ in a merrie vaine what you haue heard.</p>
