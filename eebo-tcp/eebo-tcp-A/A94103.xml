            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Substance of the Bill againſt <hi>Clandeſtine Trade</hi> which concerns <hi>Merchants.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. SETS forth, That all Foreign Ships hovering, or in the Limits of any Port, tho' bound elſewhere, having Foreign Goods on board, and ſhall remain in the Limits of any Port, Wind and Weather permitting to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Voyage, the Maſter ſhall declare on Oath the whole Loading, where Conſigned, and who are Proprietors; and on Refuſal, to make ſuch Oath, ſuch Refuſal ſhall be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued to make an Importation thereof; and the ſaid Goods ſhall be obliged to pay the Duties, or be liable to be ſeized as Prohibited Goods.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Every Perſon, making Entries at the <hi>Custom-Houſe,</hi> ſhall be obliged to make Oath, That he believes all the Goods that he ſo enters, are of the Country of which he enters the ſame; otherwiſe, to be liable to pay the higheſt Duties for that ſort of Goods, as that ſort of Goods pays from any Country whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All Wines to be Imported in certain Casks, that ſhall contain neither more nor leſs than the <hi>Aliquot</hi> Parts of a Tun, accounting the Tun 252 Gallons, the Butt, or Pipe, not exceeding 126 Gallons, the Puncheon 84 Gallons, the Hogſhead 63 Gallons, the Tearce 42 Gallons, the Quarter Cask 31 Gallons and ½ on Penalty of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Maſters of Ships, in Ballaſt, to make Oath he brought no Goods, nor was any Goods deliver'd out of his Ship in his Voyage; and if he be found to prevaricate, the Ship to be Forfeited.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb facs="tcp:171846:1" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <head>REASONS Humbly Offer'd againſt ſeveral Clauſes in the BILL</head>
               <p n="1">1. THIS is humbly conceived to be againſt the Law of Nations: And if it be conſider'd, how frequent it is for Foreign Ships to lie in the <hi>Downs,</hi> and other Limits of our Ports, for other Reaſons than being Wind-bound, <hi>viz.</hi> for Orders, and many other Accidents that Shipping is lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to; the Queſtion need not to have been (if they had Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Goods on board) as if the Clauſe intended to eaſe ſome Foreign Ships; but it is moſt certain, That all Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Ships have Foreign Goods on board, and therefore are all obliged to diſcover their Secrets of their Voyage on Oath, or be liable to Forfeiture.</p>
               <p>If this paſs into a Law, it will give a Liberty to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Cuſtoms to inſult Strangers, tho' never ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and conſequently we muſt expect the like Uſage all the World over.</p>
               <p>Note, <hi>All Ports, Roads, and Harbours hitherto, have been free to Foreigners in Amity, to come into, to go out of, or remain as long as their Occaſions require.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This Clauſe lays the Streſs upon the Oath of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter, and will be ſo far from preventing <hi>Clandeſtine Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> that it will encourage the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> Suppoſing an Ill Dealer, that values not his Oath, Imports 100 Tun of <hi>French</hi> Wines, and enters it, and ſwears it's of any other Country, he then pays 3000 <hi>l.</hi> leſs than the Fair Dealer, that will not make ſuch Oath.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Clauſe is to oblige a Merchant to that which is not poſſible for him to perform, there being no Cask made now in <hi>Europe</hi> ſo exact, neither is it in the Power of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, to oblige Princes and States to alter their Casks ſettled by their Laws; and if ſuch a Clauſe ſhould paſs into a Law, they ſhall be neceſſitated to give over Trade.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Clauſe ſubjects the Forfeiture of the Ship, for the Act of the Maſter or Seamen, though they have not any property in her, and will diſcourage Merchants to build, or bear any part in Shipping.</p>
