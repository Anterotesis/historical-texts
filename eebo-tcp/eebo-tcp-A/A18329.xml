            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>After manie cogitations which perplexed his mind not a little, he resolued in as secret maner as might be, to depart with one onely Squire to attend vpon his person, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to take his voyage directly into Macedon, there to make his first assay of Armes in the aduenture of <hi>Celestina</hi> the Faire, who was at that time enchaunted within a castell of

               <p>The Emperour who heard afterward ofhis secret depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was passing glad of this enterprise, and in presence of many knights began thus in his fauour: Now as God mee helpe, I haue an opinion, nay, a confident hope, <hi>Belcarin</hi> will be haue himselfe so valiantly in feates of armes, that all ye will be glad in heart to heare me make the discourse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

Soone after perceiued he the traine of this ladie, and for that he feared to be discouered by some of the companie, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his horse to be brought him, and mounted, he tooke againe into the way wherein he was going before, whereat <hi>Alde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> somewhat displeased, for she would verie faine haue knowne who he was, boorded him thus.</p>
               <p>Sir knight, stay here boldly at your ease, and forsake not this sw√©et and delectable place for our comming: for consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the great heate of the day, it is yet no time for you to trauell on your way. And if you go peraduenture to the tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which is held in Macedon, you may come thither in good time with the Duke my father, who shall b√©e verie glad of your companie, &amp; I much more, who met you here by chance first of all.</p>

                  <hi>Belcarin</hi> humblie thanking her for this curtesie, made his excuse that he could not go into Macedon, because he had many other more vrgent affairs in another quarter, whether he did pretend his voiage, therefore once more he tooke leaue of her againe, and spurred his horse that way which s√©emed fittest for his purpose: onely to get himselfe as farre as h√©e could from this companie: and m√©eting a Squire who came after the traine and carriages, he demaunded of him, if h√©e knew not the Lord who rode before with so great a traine? the Squire answered him, it was the Duke of Pontus, who was going into Macedone to the feast which king <hi>Florendos</hi>

celebrated for the mariage of the infant <hi>Denise,</hi> and that he had in companie with him his daughter <hi>Alderine,</hi> to s√©e the iustes &amp; tournaments which they were there preparing.</p>

                  </gap>or he should haue time enough afterward to perform his voiage. Thus did <hi>Belcarin</hi> forsake the way towardes the Isle of Carderie to take that of Macedon, which was little more than thr√©e daies iourney from thence. On the third day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come n√©ere the citie, he met with two knights armed, who went to this tourney, and after enterchange of salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, the two knights asked him if hee came not thither to iust.

               <p>Whereat the Duke <hi>Anemon,</hi> who saw his side put to the woorse, was in a great rage against them: and as h√©e perceiued all this to proc√©ede from the comming in of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carin,</hi> he began presently to gather in towards him, and to salute him with a great blowe of his swoorde vppon his helmet, of whome by and by he receiued quicke paiment: for that <hi>Belcarin</hi> lifting himselfe vppon his Stirrops, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him a full blow so right on his Beauer, that he set him packing in a maze vnder his horse heeles. Then passing further, made way thorow the presse, and bore downe to the ground all that euer he met, in such manner that king <hi>Florendos,</hi> and the other Nobles who did accompanie him, were in a great woonder, and none could discrie, nor giue anie knowledge who h√©e should b√©e, except <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derine,</hi> who then sitting there hard by Qu√©ene <hi>Denise,</hi> coulde not holde her tongue, but must prattle of him thus.</p>
               <p>Madame, how thinke you ofthe knight in the gr√©ene ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour? What I thinke? (quoth she) I neuer saw man at Armes who might compare with him, s√©eing that alone h√©e hath done more in this Tourney, then the rest, put all together: and I should b√©e verie glad to knowe whether hee bee of so noble bloud, as he is valiant and skilfull in the exercise of Armes.</p>
               <p>Madame, replied <hi>Alderine,</hi> I bel√©eue hee cannot be but a great personage, s√©eing that he k√©epeth himselfe so close, and will not bee discouered of anie: Moreouer, shee tolde her, howe sh√©e found him at the Fountaine bare headed, his Murrion lying by him. And knowe ye (quoth she) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c√©eding further, that if hee bee valiant at Armes, as

Now I haue a great desire (quoth Qu√©ene <hi>Denise</hi>) to know who he is, so that I thinke best to send a messenger to him for the same effect. Then (quoth <hi>Alderine</hi> interrupting her) Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, I pray you that the messenger may be one of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, who shall wait for him at the going out of the Tylt, to coniure him on your behalfe to declare his name: and if he desire not to be knowne, we will conceale it so secretly that no man shall knowe it by our meane. Your opinion liketh me best of all other (quoth the newe Bride) but I would that this errand were done from you: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Alderine</hi> then called one of her Pages, named <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> and instructed him what h√©e had to say to the Knight in the gr√©ene armour, to whome shee sent him expreslie, with instant request, ioyned with a singular desire to knowe who he was. In the meane time, <hi>Belcarin</hi> did such admirable things in his Iustes, and with such his insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable dexteritie and martiall prowesse did so canuasse his aduersaries, that being no longer able to stand before him, they got away, and departed out of the lists, where he remained alone victorious. Then the two knightes with whom he soiourned, who had beene rather occupied all this while to beholde his prowesses, than to Iust and Tilt, b√©eing woonderfull glad ofthe honour he did them, in winning the honour of this day, set him in the middest betw√©ene them, and so tooke their way towardes their Tent: whither they were followed by the Page of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derine,</hi> who neuer lost sight of them, but finding a fit place for the purpose, tooke <hi>Belcarins</hi> Horse by the Bridle, and bowing downe with a low reuerence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thus: Faire Knight, may you please to heare two woordes of a message which I haue to doe vnto you:

He, who was most courteous and affable, withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe presently from his companions, when <hi>Gracian</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c√©eded in this maner.</p>

               <p>My brother, answered <hi>Belcarin,</hi> it should be some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, nay impossible thing, if I did not vndertake it to finde pardon at so high a ladies hands as your mistres is: albeit if I haue made an offence towards her excellencie, it was onely through mine ignorance, who knew her not.

               <p>Then the page replied: S√©eing that it is your pleasure to accomplish that which my ladie <hi>Alderine</hi> would entreat you, know she hath an extreame desire to know who you are, and wherfore you keepe your selfe so close &amp; secret: for considering your valour and chiualry, she esteemeth you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all others, of whom as yet she had euer any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: promising you also by the faith ofsuch a lady as sh√©e is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Further you shall assure her from me, that I offer my selfe from henceforth to serue her as her most humble knight, hoping vnder the fauour of her famous name, to win so great reputation, that I and my posteritie shall for euer remaine her bounden seruaunts. And then when I haue done those thinges, whereby I may merite honour and commendation, I will come vnto her my selfe to make her the offer of my heart, which f√©eleth it selfe so much affectioned to obey her, that it shall not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing hereafter, which may not be to her liking and pleasure. So much she shall know in commanding me, for I haue so readie a will to employ my selfe in her seruice that notwithstanding the hazard of my life did depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doing it, I will not spare any of my best forces: Bes√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching her moreouer not to disclose my name to any one for that I would at this present visit the king <hi>Florendos</hi> and the Qu√©ene my grandfather and grandame.</p>
               <p>With this answere returned <hi>Gracian</hi> to his mistres, who staied for him in so great deuotion, that so soone as sh√©e saw him come a farre of, she could not containe, but must n√©eds aske him what successe had followed the exploit of his ambassage. Well Madame answered the page, but you must k√©epe it secret, for so is his humble request. That shal w√©e doe most willingly quoth they, and then h√©e recounted to them all that h√©e had vnderstoode of him, saying that h√©e was <hi>Belcarin</hi> the king of Hungaries sonne. What is it he?

Thrise blewe the watch which was aboue at the sentinell his horne to fortifie his champion to the battell: which continued so long that in the end <hi>Belcarin</hi> felt himselfe a little wearied, by reason he had not rested himselfe all that day. Neuerthelesse h√©e imagined with himselfe, that shewing no other valour then that which he vsed in this skirmish, in vaine had h√©e taken so great paine to come thither: which h√©e would haue counted a great shame, if the Emperour had b√©ene aduertised thereof.</p>
               <p>Being in this imagination, his stomacke began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in him maruellously, wherefore he gathered n√©ere his enemie, thinking to lay him along on the ground: but the knight of the bridge was too warie for him to be taken at that disaduauntage, for stepping a little aside, he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him so sound a blowe on his crest, that he cleft it in two p√©eces. When <hi>Belcarin</hi> saw himselfe in this daunger, h√©e threw with a mightie violence the two p√©eces at his aduersarie, and by great chaunce hit him so full ouer the shinnes, that the knight fell backeward, and turned round twice or thrice in the place.</p>

               <p>Glad was <hi>Tiraquel</hi> to find him here, that he might vpon so good quarrel, as he thought, begin his first feats of arms: <hi>Belcarin</hi> who knew him by his harnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Straight will I s√©e that (replied <hi>Belca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>) whether it be in your power to make me confesse that which I neuer once thought of, much lesse euer commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. You did felloniouslie commit the homicide, replied <hi>Tiraquel</hi> then, and take h√©ede of me vpon such an occasion, for I haue a great desire to make you repent it: Scant had he ended these sp√©eches, but they ranne full one at another: and so furious was their m√©eting, that their Launces fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in p√©eces, they dasht each other so mightily with their sh√©eldes, that they wounded one another a little. <hi>Belcarin</hi> he lost his Stirrops, and <hi>Tiraquel</hi> went to the ground, but that was by his horses fault, who being wearie and tired by the long way which he had caried his master, who was verie corpulent and mightie, was sore galled, and had his backe broken at the encounter: yet <hi>Tiraquel</hi> getting vp quickly againe, set most brauely hand to his sword, crying: Alight, knight, or I will kill thy Monture. I will alight most willingly (quoth <hi>Belcarin</hi>) but it shall be to embrace you, for that I haue no will to fight with you any longer. What, what, quoth <hi>Tiraquel,</hi> there is no n√©ed of triumph: for if I be fallen from my horse, for that you haue not van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished me. Great delight tooke <hi>Belcarin,</hi> to f√©ele himselfe so couragiously spoken vnto by his most deare and singular friend: neuerthelesse, willing to sound him better yet, he alighted forthwith, &amp; came to him directly with his sword in his hand. Knight, quoth hee, I spake to you for your great good, notwithstanding (because you will haue it so) I am content to s√©e what you can do with your sword. Then <hi>Tiraquel,</hi> who thought verily that hee was flowted, in a great chafe, hit him two great blowes betw√©en the cuirasse and the helmet: but <hi>Belcarin</hi> had no will to strike, therfore (to make no hotter sport) he laid downe incontinent on the ground his sword and sh√©eld, then came with open armes to giue him a ioyfull acolade, saying: My intire friend <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raquel,</hi> I haue ere now sufficiently knowne your valour
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23383:20"/>
and prowesse, wherefore I pray you pardon your brother <hi>Belcarin</hi> the offence he made, in not imparting to you his deliberation, when he departed from Constantinople: for I am assured you go s√©eking after him. What, quickly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Tiraquel,</hi> are you then my brother <hi>Belcarin</hi>? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the errour which I haue now committed, hath b√©ene for that I knew you not, by meanes whereof, I pray you of all fauour, that you will cast down your helmet, for that the armes which I s√©e on your backe now, haue caused in me this ouersight.</p>
               <p>Then helmets went on both sides to the ground, and these two companions many times embraced each other most louingly, when <hi>Tiraquel</hi> in this sort spake to <hi>Belcarin</hi>: In good faith sir, it cannot by any mean sink into my head, that your heart hath euer consented to commit such a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous act, as this damsell hath persuaded me to bel√©eue. Tell me, I pray you now, began <hi>Belcarin,</hi> what fellow is this? for another knight (whom I suppose I slue, or at the least sore wounded) hath already fought with me vpon that quarell: assuring you this damsell should be some bad wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, s√©eing she accuseth me thus wrongfully, and staineth mine honor with this disloialtie. She hath giuen me to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d, quoth <hi>Tiraquel,</hi> how her father hauing greatly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured you in his castell, one night that you lodged there, and the morrow morning hauing sent thr√©e of his sonnes to accompanie you on your way, how you should slay two of them outright, leauing the third sore wounded. Ah, treacherous damsell, then quoth <hi>Belcarin,</hi> how manifest a lie doe I nowe heare? My companion, most true it is, that I slept one night in the Castell that she speaketh of, where I neuer saw man, but the Lord of the place, who was a verie honourable and courteous knight: of whom taking my leaue the morrow morning all alone, when I had scant gone little more then two miles, I founde at the side of a forrest, thr√©e knights all armed, who forced me to Iust against them, and my fortune was at the first
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:23383:20"/>
encounter to lay one on the ground with my launce: which the other perceiuing, ranne both with great violence vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, but I deliuered my selfe from them as well as I might. If they were the sonnes of the Lord of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell, that knowe not I, greatly it should displease mee if they were, for the honour and good entertainement I receyued at his handes. I bel√©eue assuredly as you say, then replied <hi>Tiraquel,</hi> and this damsell can not be but some shamelesse and badde woman, who hath deceyued mee with this lie: But sh√©e maie thanke the great gladnesse which hath seased my spirites in seeing you, otherwise I should chastice her sharpelie, for her impudencie and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie malice.</p>
               <p>Sh√©e, who heard all these sp√©eches, and saw peace esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished betw√©ene the two Knights, hauing the verie teares standing in her eies, begins to exclaime thus: Oh, most accursed and vnfortunate wretch, ah what collusion is this? Certes, this knight whom I brought hither, s√©emes to me as false and disloial as the other, of whom I s√©eke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge: neuerthelesse, s√©eing he hath circumuented me, and ill performed his promise, if I die not speedily, I hope to make him repent it, and to see my selfe reuenged of them both. Hauing vttered these speeches, shee returned the same way she came, and the two knights retired into their Tents. There <hi>Tiraquel</hi> recounted to <hi>Belcarin,</hi> how the knight whom the Damsell caused first to fight against him, vpon this supposed treason, was <hi>Sergin,</hi> whom hee had also left in the Chirurgians hands: whereof <hi>Belcarin</hi> was grieuously displeased, much blaming and cursing the shamelesse woman, who had induced them both falselie to bel√©eue her. Then for his part he discoursed to <hi>Tiraquell,</hi> all that had happened to him in this aduenture<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> also what determination hee had set downe against all those, who should come thither with like intention, for as much as he could not vndoe the inchantment himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:23383:21"/>By the faith of a Knight, quoth <hi>Tiraquel</hi> then, your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt s√©emeth to me farre greater and more difficult, than the execution of that of the Castell wherein the Ladie is prisoner, in the which I haue no minde to make assay, s√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it cannot by you bee brought to an end: but well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent will I be, to k√©epe here in your good companie. So they dwelt there together, being most exquisitely serued of all that was necessarie for them, and taking all pleasure that they might best deuise, they did there passe time meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the daughters of <hi>Lipes,</hi> who came thither manie times to visite them: Albeit, <hi>Belcarin</hi> found that hee had some what to doe, for that it behoued him to make good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst so great a number of Knights, who came thither from all parts to proue themselues in the aduenture: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides against those whom the damsell conducted thither, to reuenge the death of her brethren. But this was a strange and admirable case, that all the long time that <hi>Belcarin</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourned there, neuer came any knight thither who could go beyond him in chiualrie and prowesse: so that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme, accompanied with a singular and most commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable praise, spread it selfe ouer all the kingdome of Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and moreouer in the empire of Gr√©ece. During which painefull exercise that he continued without intermission, the delicious life which by their industrie they studied to prouide, was verie necessarie for him in that place, for that it did diminish much the sorrowe and trauaile that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured. Wherein w√©e will leaue him a little to recreate his spirites, to speake of the good Knight <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> sonne of the Emperour <hi>Cleodomyr,</hi> and of the Qu√©ene of Tarsus.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Qu√©ene of Tarsus caused with great care to be brought vp <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr</hi> her sonne, whom she had by the Emperour <hi>Cleodomyr</hi> at that time, when following the exercise of arms he arriued in the Cittie of Alfarin scituate in the kingdome of Pasme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as you haue read amply in his historie<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> This child was of so good a nature, that the qu√©en and all those of the kingdome held themselues very well pleased, because the more he grew in corpulence, so much the more he shewed himselfe vertuous, and to descend of roiall and illustrious bloud: so that to put him out of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire euer to goe s√©e his father, (fearing he would haue a will to make himselfe a Christian) they would neuer tell him of whom he was engendred. But to the end he should b√©e brought vp and well instructed, as did the Heroical gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of so high and great a prince require, the qu√©en com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the charge and gouernement of him to a brother of the defunct king of Tarsus her husband, a knight both very valiant and wise: of whom he was so vertuously instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in litterature, that his naturall enclination his fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life, and good manners did appeare euery day more then other most commendable, whereby he was exc√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly made of, and reuerenced by his friends, especially because they saw a wise discretion in him, to prefer mercie before rigour: for he tooke great pleasure to doe any fauor

or charitable act to those who did require him. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les if he appeared courteous and louing towards the good, so contrariwise he shewed himselfe bitter and seuere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the wicked, so that by reason of his meruellous wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and naturall care he had in good things, from his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry infancy and tender age, he would vnderstand the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the affairs of the kingdome: wherin, within a little while (his spirit being maruellous apt to be taught, &amp; capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all good things) he ordred himself so wel, &amp; was so good a politician in his gouernment, that the qu√©en began to lay vpon him the gouernment of the whole estate. If he enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched himselfe by little and little in the perfection of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, there wanted not in him the blossome of a liuely beautie of his bodie: wherein were all comely graces so excellent well bestowed in euery part, with the which he could so well behaue himselfe with all temperance and modesty towards al braue knights, who hearing his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses published thorow al the marches of Tarsus bordering round about, came of their owne accord to offer him their seruice.</p>
               <p>So that the court was quickly ful, when on a day before he was armed knight (for in truth beside the roiall nature which he brought with him from his mothers wombe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the aspect and celestiall influence of his constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation he was born and naturally enclined to armes) there came to sit down vpon a bench in a walking place within a base court of his pallace, an old wrinckled and decrepit woman, so ragged and torne that she shewed her bare illfauoured flesh in many places: trembling so sore, that it s√©emed her soul would strait depart out of her body. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at those who went vp &amp; down there within began to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet had some compassion on the poore wretch, and as <hi>Marcomyr</hi> came forth of his chamber, he saw her in this miserable estate, and beheld her a good while, saying not a worde, and without any sp√©ech went presently from the place to sit downe to dinner. Afterward purposing to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:23383:22"/>
some where to disport himselfe, he found her sitting in the same place where h√©e saw her before: by reason whereof, h√©e begins to say to one of his cosins, named <hi>Ozalias,</hi> sonne of his ouncle and gouernour: Cannot w√©e know who is that good old woman which you s√©e lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpon that stone seate there. Then <hi>Ozalias,</hi> to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the matter truely, came n√©ere this old beldame to demaund her who sh√©e was, and whether she would haue any thing that was within the house. But the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent old trot, answering not a word, looked vpon him with a squay looke, and then turned her backe to him: whereat <hi>Ozalias</hi> disdaining, kickt her so good a thumpe with his foot, that h√©e made her fall from her seate to the ground.</p>
               <p>At this goodly spectacle, <hi>Marcomyr</hi> began to laugh a good, and all the Barons and Nobles with him, but their laughter turned into a suddaine admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for so soone as this ould mother was risen vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, sh√©e s√©emed so great and ougly, that sh√©e made them all wonder who had beheld her so little before. Then sh√©e turned her selfe all in a rage towards the Prince, taking him vp sharply thus:</p>
               <p>Ha <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> sure thou wilt neuer resemble the Emperour of Constantinople thy father, who is as m√©eld and affable to the poorest and least, as to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test lords, and other persons of higher qualitie! What a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile hast thou gotten to reioice at the iniurie which I haue receiued of thy gentleman? I pray the great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narque <hi>Cupido</hi> (quoth she, holding vp her hands to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen) that h√©e wound thy heart cruelly with the loue of faire <hi>Celestina,</hi> and suffer th√©e neuer to leaue thinking on her, that thou maiest leaue off this daintie and peaceable life which thou now leadest, to chaunge it for that wherein men endure most paines and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels. So did a good while since thy father for the Princesse <hi>Polinard,</hi> whom he loued so perfectly, that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:23383:23"/>
with all his best force and dexterity of bodie he attempted to win the roialtie that fortune prepareth for her dearest fauourits, vpon the which he is now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>eated, enioying a far greater felicity then any other Prince dwelling vnder our hemispheare. Forsake then these court delights in which thy mother s√©eketh to drowne th√©e, begin to manage armes a little, which shall eternize thy name, and make the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which thou shalt purchase immortall: for this is thy great shame (being sonne to so rare and inuincible a knight) not to aspire by this mean to imitate him and trace in his labourious steps. Then, when I shall behold th√©e vp to the eares in thine amourous passions, languishing and tormenting thy selfe out of measure, I will thinke my selfe reuenged of the wrong and dishonor that thou hast suffered me to sustaine in thy presence.</p>
               <p>The old woman had no sooner ended these sp√©eches to <hi>Marcomyr</hi> (whom from that time forward, sh√©e dubbed knight of the order of <hi>Cupid,</hi> who is to carrie for ensigne <hi>A wounded heart pierced with an arrow</hi>) she vanished out of sight incontinent, whereat they were all sore affea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red which beheld her: euen the Prince himselfe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for a while after amazed as though he had ben in a traunce: and thinking vpon that which the old beldame had said to him, he felt his heart so troubled and fiered for the loue of her whom as yet he knew not, that he was fame to burst forth into these complaints: Alas, who may that lady be, with whose loue by the only rebuke of this old woman I feele my self already so rauished? Surely, if her sp√©eches be not coloured, or too far from any truth, that I am the Emperour of Constantinoples sonne, it behoueth me to act some thinges by which I may be iudged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble him.</p>
               <p>Meane time his spirit was thus occupied in this diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of thoughts, and that none durst be so hardie as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe him, <hi>Ozalias</hi> went to the qu√©ens chamber, where he recounted to her all this whole discourse, whereat she was
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:23383:23"/>
greatly displeased: and immediatly came into the presence for thither they said her sonne had withdrawne himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: who perceiuing his mother comming towards him, came before her with a very sad countenance, and greatly perplexed, as he was. She tooke him then by the hand, and causing him to sit downe by her, thus she beginneth: Son, I know not what sollies, it s√©emeth, this old doting wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath now put into your head, cease I pray you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l√©eue them, and I will tell you the verie truth.</p>
               <p>Madam, answered <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> I am sure you will not hide it from mee in anie thing, notwithstanding, I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell much you haue hitherto concealed from me the degr√©e of my genealogie: for the Emperour <hi>Cleodomyr,</hi> being so braue and worthie a knight as he is accounted of through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, I could haue had none occasion of disdain to be his sonne, and you lesse to haue told it me. Therefore I pray you most humbly, resolue me this doubt and scruple which I haue in my minde: to the end if it be so, I may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my best endeuours to make the bud issued from so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vertuous a braunch, blossom forth and flourish the better. And feare you not for his sake, I should euer forsake you, for it were impossible for me to leaue the law, after which I haue so long time liued, for any strange law what so euer it might be.</p>
               <p>Alas, my sonne, quoth the Qu√©ene, interrupting him, I pray the gods to inspire you, and to direct so well your desseigns, that you fully accomplish what you promise me: for the onelie feare I haue to loose you, hath made me k√©epe close til this present houre, that which you desire so much to know: But s√©eing your eares haue b√©ene tickled with that which I can no longer dissemble, assure your selfe, my sonne, what the old Beldame tolde you is most true. Then recounted she to him the whole storie: how shee, to haue issue of some excellent and worthie knight (imitating <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestria</hi> Qu√©ene of the Amazonians, who for like occasions did acquaint hir selfe with the valiant king <hi>Alexander</hi>) did
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:23383:24"/>
by the counsel of a wise Magitian, amourously deceiue the emperor <hi>Cleodomyr:</hi> in conclusion shee besought him not to leaue her whilest she liued: for that being depriued and banished from his presence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> could not liue one houre.</p>
               <p>Great matters are these which you tell me, quoth the yong prince, the Emperor then knoweth not that he hath had any children by you? No surely, replied the Qu√©ene, nor would I he should for any thing in the world. That can not be long so, quoth <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> for n√©eds must I one day goe to s√©e him: but bel√©eue me, Madam, I shall not be long away, for that I haue fully determined neuer to leaue you, nor to abandon by my will the kingdome, that God hath giuen me to gouerne. Thus communed together of many things the mother and the son, who from thence forwarde shewed himselfe to his vassals verie pleasant, and well pleased in mind: so that resoluing sp√©edily to b√©e knighted, he caused to be made for himselfe an armour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect red, and another white for <hi>Ozalias,</hi> whom he loued as his brother. And after they had watched in the chappell, they had both the sword girded to them, and the long spur put on by the father of <hi>Ozalias,</hi> who was one of the best knights in all those countries. Hauing then both of them receiued of him the accollado, order was giuen for the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mnising of a great feast for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same effect. During which feast, <hi>Marcomyr</hi> bestowed many rich presents vpon diuers. But hee could neuer forget <hi>Celestina,</hi> nor put out of his mind the words of the old beldame, for that he had them so liuely imprinted therein, that they tormented him more than might do any mortall martirdome. Wherfore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to passe into Gr√©ece, to the end to visit the Emperor his father, and to learne some newes of this ladie, for well d√©emed hee, not without cause, had the enchauntresse vsed such vile sp√©eches to him: so that one day after dinner fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Qu√©ene his mother at conuenient leisure, and in a place fit for the purpose: in very modest sort hee kissed her cheeke. And as many discourses had passed betw√©ene them,

                  <hi>Marcomyr</hi> besought her humbly, she would grant him one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It fell out the duke of Fera, a verie comly and gallant yong gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, fell in loue with her, onely by report hee heard of her: for he had manie times heard tell, that in beautie and comelinesse shee did excell the most properest of all those parts: therfore did he send to the prelate to demand her for his wife, but many times as he sent, he had his labor for his trauell, because her father would neuer be farre from her.</p>
               <p>And euen as the messenger which is sent twice or thrice into one place to obtaine something of a man, would saine haue, s√©eketh by all meanes possible to satisfie his desire who requesteth it, rather to auoide the paine and shame to be alwaies talking about the matter, then for any zeale &amp; good deuotion which he hath towards him: euen so fell it out with the bearer of this embassage: being vexed to goe and come so often without doing any good, did bring at last to passe, that he talked one day with the maiden, whom h√©e gaue so sw√©ete a lesson, and set such a glosse vpon his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to make a priuie marriage, that sh√©e was rauished in loue of the Duke, and promised him, if his master would come to take her away secretly from her fathers house, she would go willingly with him.</p>
               <p>The duke vnderstanding this embassage made hast pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently

to the isle, where being arriued, he aduertised the Damsell, who sent him word backe he should goe stay for her in a certaine place n√©ere her fathers pallace, where she would not misse to m√©et him, so soone as his people should be asl√©epe. But the preist who by meanes of his Magicke had preuented all these practises, knowing the place where the lord of Fera attended for his daughter, caused from the mountaine to descend two fierce lions enchaunted: These cruell beasts rushing in with a hideous roaring vpon the miserable Duke (who by no meane knew how to preuent such ambuskadoes) began to fawne on him in pittifull manner: meane while this young prince losing at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant all power to defend himselfe against the rage and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of these infernall beastes, was quickly torne in pieces. Which his Squier beholding (too pittifull and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a spectacle) who was come alone to accompanie him, exclaimed with such a fearefull crie, as the Damsell who had her eares most attentiue to listen, heard it easely, so also did some other of the house, who running forth with burning torches to know what was the matter, found the Duke alreadie dead: Whereof the maiden being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised, she ran out of the pallace as a body possessed with a spirit or mad, to goe to finish vp the sacrifice. So vnsuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable was the griefe and sorrow she had to s√©e her future spouse lie so cruelly massacred, that taking his very sword, set the pommell against the ground and the point right vnder her breast: then cast her selfe with a great stresse of bodie vpon it, thinking to pierce right vpon her heart, to which she would not giue one onely moment of life after the death of her louer: For all that she was frustrate of her attempt, for the sword passing thorow the right side, she fell vpon the dead bodie, still full of life, where making ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny complaints with sighes and sobs as fast as one could follow another, she wrot with her owne bloud vpon a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which she found in her bosome, twelue lamentable verses in forme of an Epitaph.

least sh√©e should make awaie her selfe, and finding her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie dead, with her Epitaph as yet in her hand: h√©e was in great daunger to haue made the third person in this pitiful tragedie. So vehement was the anguish which seased his sorrowfull soule, that he remained long time without speaking worde, as a man forlorne: and sure the sorrow and indignation that he endured, had made him die in the place, if for all comfort he had not broken his silence with an imperfect sp√©ech in this sort.</p>
               <p>Alas, miserable and wretched man, if thy knowledge did serue th√©e to act and effect the death of the duke of Fera, why was it not sufficient to preuent that of thine owne daughter? Ah in a cursed houre was I counsailed euer to take that deadly oportunitie. Manie other gr√©euous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints poured hee out ouer those two dead bodies, who might be truly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>pared to <hi>Piramus</hi> &amp; <hi>Thisbe:</hi> notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding after that he had shed ouer them many teares, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with innumerable sighs, he gaue order that a faire and rich tombe of brasse should be erected, in which after he had embaulmed them, according to the ancient ceremonie of funerall rites &amp; pomps, he caused both their bodies to be buried togither, with a great conuoy of mourners, and the Epitaph aforesaid to be engrauen round about the same. Some few daies after, thorow the griefe and melancholie he tooke, s√©eing himselfe depriued of his lawful heire, and in that behalfe the order of nature peruerted, he also lest this mortal life, but first did he shut vp &amp; make fast the treasures ofthe temple by such enchantment, and with so fearefull a guard, that since the time he died, the accesse vnto it hath bin very dangerous. So that vntill the time <hi>Marcomyr</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued there, no body could euer enter into it, albeit before <hi>Baledon</hi> had seased into his hands the Isle, a great number of knights of diuers countries had b√©ene there to trie what they could do: and thither came also for the same effect the giant himselfe, who being in a great chafe, he could not tell how to approch y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ple, because the isle s√©emed to him plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:23383:29"/>
scituated, and very goodly to behold, he inuaded it by force of armes. So that the people thereof, could neuer resist his hostilitie.</p>
               <p>But returning to our purpose, <hi>Marcomyr</hi> being arriued in this isle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> one of his marriners who knew al these things wel, told him of this mischieuous giant, and besought him in any wise not to anker in this port: for we shall all abide by it quoth he either dead or prisoners. How so, quoth <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> is there no man in the world who can abate his pride, and chastise his so great tiranny? If God helpe m√©e I will s√©e, s√©eing fortune hath guided me hether, and if I be sonne of the Emperor <hi>Cleodomyr</hi> I should not feare this lubberly kind of giants, resembling rather sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les brasen pillers in their monstrous statures, then any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine creatures, and lesse any other strange aduentures, be they neuer so difficult and dangerous: for if I will win praise and immortall honour, I must a long time follow the exercise of warfare, as he did in his yong yeres, domp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many such monsters, and atcheiuing fortunatly innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable enterprises: Turne then the prow to landward, and let vs enter hardly into the hauen, without making your selues affeard of this slouenly and villanous <hi>Golias:</hi> Then the Pilots, albeit sore against their will, leauing the shore directed the helme right betw√©ene the two rockes, where they were no sooner entered, but they saw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues shut in with the chaine which was hoised vp behind thera: whereat all of them were sore dismaied, except <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comyr</hi> and <hi>Ozalias,</hi> who equipping themselues with gant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and their helmets, which they had laid downe a little before to refresh themselues, did prepare to the defence, if peraduenture it came to any matter of blowes. The giant being aduertised there was in the hauen a rich ship fast en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed within the chaine, commanded his son to take arms and goe accompanied with some others to take them all prisoners which were come in: wherevnto the yong ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant obeied, and being well armed with thr√©e knights en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:23383:30"/>
into a squiffe: then comming as fast as they could rowe directly to <hi>Marcomyrs</hi> vessell, who was alreadie vppon the hatches, began to boord him with these prowd sp√©eches:</p>
               <p>Knight how durst thou presume to enter in here, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our license? I haue truely b√©ene so saucie this once, quoth <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> and the reason is, I make small account of cowards and base companions, such as thy selfe, who by damnable treacheries entrap people within this port, that you may afterward vse all crueltie and fellonie tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard them: but now it is time you receiue the due guerdon of all your execrable brutishnes. With these wordes the giant was so eager, and fell into such a rage, that h√©e com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his rowers and marriners by and by to grapple fast to the ship of <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> thinking to enter as soone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And began to reach him very great and maruellous slashes, which h√©e might doe at his ease, for the giants barque which was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the which if they two shewed the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good will that the one owed the other, yet <hi>Ozalias</hi> and the thr√©e knights of the Isle, made it appeare that they would not be scant good freindes together againe in hast. So fierce and sharpe appeared the conflict of two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst foure, that the sonne of <hi>Baledon</hi> f√©eling himselfe put to the foile by his enemie (whom he could not strike at his pleasure) resolued to put himselfe in hazard, when rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vp with his hand vpon the side of the hatches, h√©e thought to leape into the ship. But <hi>Marcomyr</hi> who slept not a winke in this skirmish, lighted a great blow vpon his arme, which sliced it quite from his shoulder: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the giant, by reason of the extreame paine he felt,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:23383:30"/>
fell downe halfe dead within his vessell, making a noise as if it had b√©en the raine and fall of some Obelisque or Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mide. In the meane time <hi>Ozalias</hi> fetcht such a beake vpon the skull of one of the thr√©e knights, that he cleft him downe to the iawes: whereat the giants skippers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sore amated, retired as fast as they could row to get quickly to land:</p>
               <p>As soon as some of them were gotten on the sande, they ran with all sp√©ed to giue <hi>Baledon</hi> vnderstanding of the sp√©edie dispatch of his sonne. When the giant heard the newes, he began to rore like a bull, with such a horrible and hoarse voice, crying: Ah, Ah, <hi>Iupiter</hi>! As my sonne dead, If so it b√©e, I will take the most cruell reuenge that euer was heard of: neuerthelesse I cannot thinke that the gods haue so farre forgotten themselues, as to destinate my sonne to so infortunate a disaster. Hauing ended this sp√©ech, he commaunded his armes to be fetcht him incontinent, the which h√©e began to put on, when they brought vp into his chamber his sonne halfe dead, whom when his eies had s√©ene, his heart began to rise so strangelie, that it had almost burst for sorrow. And of such inward bitternesse and passion did clearely demonstrate all his outward parts of his bodie, for besides he could not hold still nor armes nor legges, it s√©emed a burning flame of fire proc√©eded from his mouth, eies, and nose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrils.</p>
               <p>The two knights who had saued themselues in their barke, and some others also which had staied on the shore, spake a thousand outragious words and villanies to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comyr,</hi> assuring him one would sp√©edilie come, to make him die a cruell death. But <hi>Marcomyr</hi> answered, their reproches and menaces did moue him but a little, for their lord being a traitour and an inexecrable ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, their gods should know, it were not lawfull to suffer him to liue any longer in this world. And to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:23383:31"/>
come vnto his desire he had good confidence in them they would giue him miraculous power. And if he be such quoth he, and so valiant as you make him, let him come hardly to encounter me in single combat, in the which if I b√©e so much fauoured of Mars and fortune that I get the victory, let him accomplish only what I shall bid him, and I will saue his life: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>trariwise if I be vanquished of him, he may doe with me and mine what he shall best thinke good. Wherefore to the end h√©e know, I haue no feare of any such brauadoes, if he wil giue me safe conduct of the single combat, and assure me I shall not be hurt, but by himselfe, I will presently come a shore to defie him to the combat.</p>

In the meane time <hi>Baledon</hi> went to attend him in a plaine, hard vnder the castell, commaunding vpon paine of death all those of his side should not once stirre against his enemie.

               <p>Already the two champions haue drawne their swords, lie close vnder their sheildes, and begin so drerie a battell, smoaking one another, that you would haue iudged a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred smithes had ben a worke, beating their yron plates vpon their And-fields. But the giant raged, because his enemie held him so long resistance, therefore he charged him such a blow, that if he had not cunningly shrunke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side vnder his target, he had ben in danger to haue ended his life there. Wherefore the prince f√©eling himself in this perill, his stomacke and courage came to him more by half then it was before: and finding himselfe in such a furie as is the wild boare at the bay of the dogs when he is chased into the toiles, hit him such a gash vnder his roundache, with his full force, that peircing his harnesse cleane tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, he cut his flesh to the bone.

               <p>When the giant perceiued himselfe in such dolefull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie, and so bad taking to defend himself, he murmured these words softly with a heauy chear.

And you knight shew me so much fauour for my soules last comfort before it depart out ofthis world, that I may once yet s√©e her whom I haue heretofore loued as my selfe. When he had ended these lamentations (which none could well vnderstand, for death which had alreadie seased vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on part of <hi>Baledons</hi> carkas, caused him to strammer and to alter his sp√©ech) he called the people to him, commanding they should forthwith bring the knight vp into the castell to consigne into his hands, all the prisoners which were in chaines, and to obey him in all things as if it were his own person. Then went <hi>Marcomyr</hi> and <hi>Ozalias</hi> with two or thr√©e oftheir people towards the pallace, where in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great base court they met with the giants wife, who lamented bitterly for the great mischance of her sonne and husband, cursing and blaspheming the knight who had plonged her in that goulfe of sorrow and anguish.

               <p>The battell betw√©ene them was bloodie and cruell, continuing so long, till in the end being both wearie and tyred, they fell downe n√©ere dead in the place, where <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comyr</hi> lay in a sownde till late in the euening, when h√©e came to himselfe againe, and rising vp verie deftly (for he felt no hurt, nor f√©eblenesse at all) he looked wishly round about him on all sides, and saw no enemie: wherefore he tooke vp his armes to enter into the Temple, the gates whereof shewed themselues alreadie open, which did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in him a farre greater desire to goe in.

Then stept downe from the sepulchre to go further into the Temple, to s√©eke for the enclosure and cabinet wherein the treasure was hidden. But ere he had gone farre, hee found in the Sanctuarie thereof an aultar where the ancient sacrifices were offered vp, verie costly enriched, and an idoll all of massie golde, which wore an imperiall crowne vpon his head, and a scepter in his right hand, so rich and full of worke, that it were impossible to behold two iewels more rare: being garnished with great collers set with manie precious stones of inestimable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.

B√©e srolicke then, and repute the happines of your renowne to surpasse that of all the aduentures of this age: for since the first beginning of this enchantment was neuer knight able to enter in here but you: wherefore by iust reason is the treasure yours, which a long time hath

Assuring you, hereafter shall b√©e by your meane accessible and frequented this temple, the which you shall consecrate to the name of Christ, who hath b√©ene a mediatour to his father to direct all your actions so well: To the end h√©e may b√©e reuerenced and serued deuoutly in this place, wherein heretofore hath b√©ene nothing vsed but blasphemie and Idolatrie, against his infinit bountie; in making vowes, offerings and sacrifices vnto mortall men. And albeit you are now no Christian, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse from hence forth for my sake become one, for the time shall come you shall say: O thrice and foure times happie houre, you met with m√©e. And when you haue giuen order for all that I tell you, make no longer tariance in these countries, for in other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions and climats is reserued for you a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant scepter, enriched with all honour and immortall praise.</p>
               <p>W√©e n√©ed not aske whether <hi>Marcomyr</hi> did meruaile, hearing the voice of the Damsell, who came to succour him in this austere desert, to decipher to him so well his affaires: For the extasie and rauish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his spirits, (who had then s√©ene his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce) did giue sufficient testimonie thereof. Yet s√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe in place fit to speake to this Damsell, h√©e called his spirits againe to him, and embouldened him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to say thus: Madame, for the honour and reuerence you beare vnto your God, I pray you not to conceale from me, who you are that know m√©e so well: and I bes√©ech you therein excuse mine vnwise request, for your rare and perfect beautie, which doth prouoke m√©e to demaund it, doth draw m√©e into greater admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, then all the other strange visions which I

haue now s√©ene: the which I held for friuolous and Diabolicall, in respect of you, who s√©eme to m√©e celestiall, and sent hether of the gods into these base regions, s√©eing that you discoursing so well of the future euent of my destinies, doe comfort my sorrowfull heart with an incredible ioy and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Courteous knight (quoth she) thinke not strange at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing I tell you, for it is long since I knew who you are, and for your prowesse and valour I loue you and est√©eme you more then any other knight of this round world, therefore am I come hether, farre from the countrey where I was borne, to make you vnderstand it: Praying you to pardon m√©e otherwise if I doe not tell you who I am, for at this present your curiositie is not to b√©e satisfied herein: well will I assure you before long time passe, w√©e shall s√©e one another at pleasure together, and then shall you know something of my doings, by a gift which I will request at your hands, which is not now to be disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. It should b√©e a great ioy and an vnspeakeable comfort to m√©e, replied <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> if you would commaund m√©e something, in which I might employ the vertue of all my forces, with the perfect deuotion I f√©ele alreadie vowed to make the world know the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affection I haue to obey you, and to rest alwaies your faithfull friend: Offering my selfe for earnest of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beisance, hereafter to serue you as your knight, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise not to transgresse the least of your commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as long as my life shall dwell in this terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bodie. And thinke not I will any more importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate you to tell me who you are, s√©eing that it is not your will I should know it, albeit to haue knowne it, had b√©ene to me a thing most acceptable, so that euerie day to me shall s√©eme a thousand yeares, vntill I s√©e the

hower which you say is so happie for me: But in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, I wil accomplish for my part all that which it hath pleased you to giue me in charge, and will dedicate this temple to the seruice of your God, whose faith alreadie hath by your meane greatlie edified m√©e in this Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call truth.</p>
               <p>Whilst the Damsel gaue him thanks for this good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and for his so many amiable sp√©eches, behold the old beldame came who enchaunted him with the loue of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestina</hi> in his Kingdome, and taking this maiden by the hand saith to her: Come away with me my daughter, and leaue this discourteous and foolish Knight alone, who suffered me to be misued before his presence in Tarsus: for which abuse I hope full soone to b√©e reuenged on him, by the extreame anguish and passion his heart shall endure hereafter.</p>
               <p>Scarsely had she spoken these last words, but both of them vanished away at the very instant, whereat <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr</hi> maruelled much, and from that time forward entered into such a d√©epe conceit of the liuely and perfect beautie of this Damsell, that he had almost died with the thought thereof: for it s√©emed to him he had neuer s√©ene her second, and in truth he was not deceiued in his iudgement in this matter, as many young louers b√©e, who in their owne loues shew themselues too fauourable iudges. By and by he thought with himselfe, because the old mother had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her away from hard by him, this Damsell must sure be <hi>Celestina,</hi> her for whom he felt so liuely imprinted in his heart, the loue which did encrease in him more euery day then other, at the onely remembrance of this ladie, and forced him first to abandon his kingdome. So great was then the perplexitie of his spirit, because of this amou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fantasie, that vnstopping the fludgates of his eies, h√©e shead a great streame of teares, which were tossed with the impetuous wind of his sighes, so thicke one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that during this torment, he was faine to exclaime
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:23383:39"/>
thus: Alas, olde mother, I knowe not what thou maiest b√©e, but well I finde thy sp√©eches to be true: O that in an ill houre for the happinesse of my life did <hi>Ozalias</hi> anger th√©e in my presence. Ah, cruell enemie, why hast thou so soone depriued my sight of the vnspeakable content it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, beholding this angelicall and diuine face? Thou diddest permit me to s√©e her, that I should loue her past all measure, albeit I know not how thy wordes haue pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced my heart so farre, that I could not taste of anie more sharpe and corosiue bitternesse: notwithstanding, if this be the obiect of <hi>Celestina,</hi> (who s√©emed to mee the fairest, and most exquisite p√©ece, that euer presented it selfe to mine eye) I will neuer rest, till I haue met her once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>In this anguish of minde remained the knight long time, so astonished, as if h√©e had come from the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes, and accusing himselfe greatly of simplicitie, and want of courage, blamed the olde woman, who had cleane taken away his strength, vnable to stay the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell with him: whose presence and gracious sp√©eces did so content him, as hee thought him selfe in eternall blessednesse for the while. To b√©e briefe, as soone as h√©e perceyued the cleare morning to chase towardes the West the darkenesse of the night, hee resolued to effect all that the vision did commaund him: wherefore he went straight to the Aultar where the riches was, and taking the golden basins, with all the other sumptuous things, hee laide them all on a heape, to carrie them out of the Temple, and spoiled moreouer the idoll of his scepter and crowne which he had about him.</p>
               <p>In the meane time were <hi>Ozalias, Rifaran,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Knights verie sadde and melancholicke, thinking they had lost <hi>Marcomyr</hi> their lorde; wherefore they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to goe see what was become of him: and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie <hi>Ozalias,</hi> who without delay called vppon all the rest to follow him thorowe the same way, which h√©e per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued

his cousin had cut out to the Temple. And b√©eing come to the place of the combate, they first found the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible boare slaine, whereof b√©eing most ioyfull, and maruailing much, they amased themselues there all a little to beholde rhis monstrous animall, except <hi>Oza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias,</hi> who b√©eing desirous to s√©e the Prince, entered as soone as euer h√©e came thither into the Temple, where sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching within a great Chest which h√©e found, h√©e percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the principall treasure of the Priest, which did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in so great riches, and so manie rare things, that the valour and excellencie thereof did make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable, and all humane wits were not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putate them.</p>
               <p>Great was the ioy that <hi>Marcomyr</hi> felt in his heart s√©eng <hi>Ozalias</hi> so neare him, so that running to embrace one another, they enterlaced a thousand courtesies, ioyes, and amiable sp√©eches to each other, when <hi>Ozalias</hi> first brake foorth into these words, Alas, Sir, howe much haue the Gods exalted this day your prayse, deliuering you from the rage of this infernall beast, and from other monstrous things which haue repaired to you in this wilde habitacle. So that <hi>Ozalias</hi> blessed and thanked the Planet which did so much fauour <hi>Marcomyr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then entered <hi>Rifaran, Lechefin,</hi> and all the other Knights, within the Temple, who all thanked the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens for so great a victorie: And after they had all one after another saluted <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> hee recounted to them from poynt to poynt, all that fortuned to him after he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them, except of the Damsell, of whome h√©e would saie nothing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When the Emperour had made an end of reading this letter, <hi>Rifaran</hi> began to make relation to him how they met in Delphos, a knight called <hi>Marcomyr</hi> whose valian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and Prowesse had no second in the world (except the Emperour himselfe, who was the myrrour and paragon of all chiualrie) to be compared vnto him: but they were sorrie for one thing, they could not tell who he was, for so much he himselfe would not let them vnderstand, but kept himselfe as close as might be: then hauing all their priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and presents in a readines, he framed this sp√©ech vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: Most illustrious and generous monarque <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr</hi> the magnanimious and hardie champion who deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs out of the most cruell prison of the giant <hi>Baledon</hi> in the Isle of Delphos, sendeth vs now (with all these priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, goods, and riches which you s√©e) to your maiesties highnesse, as to the prince and lord of the vniuersal world, whom h√©e hath knowne by your renowne most worthie thereof, assuring himself so far of your naturall lenitie, that you will pittie our disasters, and helpe to conduct vs home to our owne houses againe.</p>

               <p>Might it please God to graunt vs the fauour, quoth the Qu√©ene, that this Knight would once come into our Court, to the end w√©e might giue him condigne guerdon and thankes for the great honour he deserueth.

finished the aduenture of Delphos, h√©e could not choose but be as braue a Knight as anie liuing. In summe the Emperour did not so much maruaile at the magnificence and riches of this present, the sumptuositie whereof might not onely compare with all the treasure of <hi>Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes, Iulius Caesar,</hi> or <hi>Alexander,</hi> but also did farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c√©ede all the reuenewes of his Empyre, as at the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous feates of armes and renowmed chiualrie of the Knight whome he yet knew not, but did desire to s√©e him in his Court, to the ende h√©e might honour him according to his desart.</p>
               <p>To manie Knights of the Emperours traine s√©emed these woordes verie peremptorie and odious, who from that time forwarde purposed in themselues (if peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Marcomyr</hi> came into the Court) to proue their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours agaynst him so, that the Emperour might haue occasion to remember himselfe h√©e had spoken but by way of affection: Neuerthelesse he did not perceiue their conceyte, but replenished with a maruailous ioy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by all meanes they should giue order to get all things in a readinesse agaynst the next Triumph which was then at hande.

               <p>To conclude, the Emperour sent presentlie vnto Delphos one of his principall Knights, with a great troupe of armed Souldiers, to assure it vnto himselfe, for feare least if anie rebellion chaunced, h√©e should hardlie possesse himselfe of the Castell, and of the whole Isle in his owne name.

Then the Knight inuested himselfe, and tooke possession of the Pallace, whether all the people of the Isle resorted to s√©e him, and to accept the Emperour for the peaceable and liege Prince of that state, who in the ende translated it to one of <hi>Marcomyrs</hi> children, and it was ind√©ed a verie goodly and rich countrie.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Eolus</hi> and <hi>Neptune</hi> were so fauorable vnto him, that on the seuenth day he came to surge within the strait of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stos and Abidos, where hauing giuen commandement to strike sailes, one of his Pilots, who was aboue in the top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mast, espied at sea many foysts and ships skirmishing cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously togither: wherevpon <hi>Marcomyr</hi> got into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castell, to s√©e if he could perceiue what should be the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and hearing the great stir and noise which they made in these vessels, especially intwo of them which s√©emed the principal, and better equipped with warlike munition the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the others, he had great desire to make towardes them.

               <p>
                  <hi>Abenunq</hi> then sailing merrilie towards the coast of Thrace, he met with <hi>Olurites</hi> king of Culaquin, and sonne in law to the great Turke, who was est√©emed one of the most valiant and noble knights amongst all the Turkish nobilitie, and therefore had the barbarous tyrant bestowed on him his daughter, one of the fairest ladies which was in all the Heathen dominion. This king <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curites,</hi> who knew the emnitie and old grudge betw√©ene the Emperour and his father in law the Turke, rigd out a nauie, to gratifie him the more, and k√©eping along the coast of Gr√©ece, sent alwaies before him pinnaces and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates to discouer the Christian failes: so that he caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him many slaues and captiues then, when h√©e began to lie in the wind for the Soldans sonne. So soone as this Rouer knew the Prince of Babilon by his flagges and streamers he purposed to set vpon him with a great furie, for he knew his father was the Emperours great friend, and as he had ch√©ered vp his men to the fight, h√©e came vpon <hi>Abenunq</hi> his ship, who s√©eing this vnlooked for encounter, set his men brauely in order to receaue him:</p>
               <p>During this conflict, behold arriueth the valiant knight <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> who being astonished to s√©e these combatta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts so hot, had a meruellous desire to defend the partakers and welwillers of the Emperour <hi>Cleodomyr:</hi> wherefore h√©e commanded his marriners to grapple his ship to the kings. Which they did quickly: then drawing his good sword which he found vpon the Duke of Fera his tombe, suddainely he leapt into the vessell where <hi>Ocurites</hi> was:

then began he to lay about him furiously on euery <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Euill for thy profite didst thou euer thinke, king <hi>Ocurites</hi> to domage so good a prince as is the Emperour of Constantinople: and s√©eing <hi>Ozalias</hi> at his side readie to second him in all attempts, they ran pell mell into the thickest of the troupe, where they made so sharpe and cruell a battell, that they forced the enemies to retire towards their admirall. Who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ouer the Christians with whom he fought, those whom the Soldan had sent towards the Emperour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reproch and reuile his owne men, who ran away like dogs from the presence of two single knights. He pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to come forward to m√©et them himselfe, and mist go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the pot as narrowly as might be, for <hi>Marcomyr</hi> d√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him by his brauing and rich arms which h√©e saw on his backe, to be the king, ran vpon him incontinent with his sword in his hand, and crost him such a blow ouer his creast, that h√©e made him f√©ele it smart to the flesh, where h√©e carried a skar afterwards, as long as he liued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ocurites</hi> being not able to resist the furie ofthe stroakes which his aduersarie lighted on him so thicke and thr√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, was forced to kn√©ele on ground with one kn√©e. H√©e thought to rise vp quickly again, but <hi>Marcomyr</hi> disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, for he gaue him such a knock with his shield, that he laid him along vnder his souldiers f√©et, who s√©eing their king so easily vanquished, were put into such a feare, that it was not long after before they carried away the worst, and were taken prisoners for their labour. For the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian knights which defended the poup, came downe to their aid, so that their ship was taken, and in <hi>Marcomyrs</hi> hands, who went presently to the king, and for h√©e would not kill him nor doe him more harme, onely vncased his helmet from his head, and caused him to be put into a cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban n√©ere the k√©ele of the ship, vnder the guard of foure va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant knights. Whereof <hi>Alenunq</hi> being aduertised, who looked euery houre for his owne death or imprisonment,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:23383:46"/>
leapt quickly vpon the orlop of the ship where h√©e saw <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> and thanking him a thousand times, for this good succour, requested very courteously to tel him who be was.</p>
               <p>As the knight began to answeare the Prince of Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, perceiuing him to be the chiefe of al his crue, h√©e heard a great noise about his ship, it was the brother of king <hi>Ocurites</hi> who hauing vnderstood the ouerthrow of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and how he was prisoner, grappeled himselfe to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benunqs</hi> vessell, into which he entered brauely maugre all those who did make him resistance, knocking downe on euery side, as if it had b√©ene vpon some yron barre hamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the smiths Antfield. And as <hi>Marcomyr</hi> saw so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enemies readie with their arms in hand, h√©e left the Soldans sonne to run vpon them, which he did with such a rage, that no man can recount the warlike exploits and wonderfull feats of armes he performed in this recharge: for with one blow which he smot <hi>Ocurites</hi> brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tw√©ene the cuirasse and the head peice, he cut his head cleane from his shoulders. Many others forced he to f√©ele the strength of his arme, for ere they had long stood before him, he sent their souls one after another into the infernal lake, making such a bloudie anatomie of these dogs, that it was a great horrour to behold what a slaughter there was. Neuerthelsse so great was the furie he was faine to abide in this skirmish, that he could not escape without two wounds, which were the first he receiued, albeit h√©e had before fought with the fierce giant <hi>Baledon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when <hi>Marcomyr</hi> had so manfully behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the dispatch of so mightie an enemie, he still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued his point vpon some other ships of warre, which h√©e saw yet in fight with those of the Soldan, therefore went he aboord <hi>Ocurites</hi> gallion to rel√©eue them with some spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die succour: wherof as soone as the Turks were aware, they began to run into such a feare and perplexitie, that part of them were forced to flie disorderly, and run foule

               <p>These words came from his mouth, but in his mind he had another determination, for as soone as he heard of the iousts in Constantinople, he determined to go thether se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly without any other manifestation of himselfe, but only in shew of a strange knight, called <hi>Marcomyr</hi>: with this excuse he tooke leaue of <hi>Abenunq,</hi> who offered him many presents, but he would accept none, thanking him much for his good will, especially of the assurance he gaue him not to depart any way from the Emperours court, vntill he arriued there, for h√©e made him a promise before many daies were past, he would appeare there in person, as he requested him to giue the Emperour to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, then bidding him adiue, entered aboord his ship, commanding his maister to lanch out a contrary way.</p>

and acquaintance betw√©ene these two, hoping both one day to be companions in arms together. <hi>Abenunq</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed then the summe of <hi>Marcomyrs</hi> message, and could neuer satisfie himself with sufficiently commending his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall bountie and vnspeakeable valour, so that the good prince was stil inflamed more and more to s√©e this knight, for whom he blessed and praised God, who had infused so many perfections into him: the which <hi>Rifaran</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chefin</hi> did confirme by this little word, that there can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be so much good and honour spoken in his praise, but the merit of his vertues would far exc√©ed the capacity of the most learned and eloquent tongue which should b√©e emploied to that purpose. After that <hi>Abenunq</hi> had deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red some other matters of his embassage to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, he went to s√©e the Empresse in her chamber, and as he would haue bowed himselfe to kisse her hand with the more reuerence, the honourable ladie rising vp from her seat to saue him that labour, receaued him wonderfull courteously, and at large demanded him the newesfrom <hi>Archidiana</hi> his mother: whom the prince answered in al points very sagely, as from his childhood he had ben lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to doe: then came to embrase him sw√©etly the infant <hi>Philocrista</hi> and <hi>Esquiuela</hi> her companion, who could not tell what countenance to make for the extreame ioy sh√©e felt in her mind, hauing before her eies the second highest hope of her heart: and albeit she did all she might to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble it, she was constrained notwithstanding in the end to fill the eares of the assistants with these sp√©eches:</p>

Souldan our father hauing vnderstood the honour which the Emperour doth you in matching you with the prince <hi>Ditreus</hi> his nephew, hath sent me to giue him heartie thanks, and to offer on his part vpon conclusion of the articles of contract, such agr√©ements as shall like him well, being assured these things so well handled by him, cannot chuse but be acceptable to both parties contracted. As for madame <hi>Archidiana</hi> our mother, she presenteth you by me many Iewels, rich stuffes, and other exquisite singularities sutable to a princesse of so great a house as you are, to the end on your mariage day, you may shew the maiestie of the race whence you are descended: hereof <hi>Esquiuela</hi> and <hi>Dit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the meane time the Emperour he caused a triumph to be published thorowout all Gr√©ece, and vpon the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t√©enth day following, should the marriage be solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly celebrated, so that you might haue s√©ene what an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of knights flocked daily to the court from all parts. Amongst others thether came <hi>Linides</hi> lord of the island Liquia, he that had done more valiant acts in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture of <hi>Celestina</hi> then any other aduenturer: And of a truth was thought to be one of the best men at armes at that time in all the Empire, thorow the which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready spread the fame of this feast.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:23383:49"/>
attending the triumph, he should find two knights readie in the field, who would hold them play: for so had they the night before laid their plot.</p>
               <p>As soone as the squire had published his message in the pallace, the Duke <hi>de Pera</hi> vnderstanding thereof, made this answeare to him: Gentleman my friend, returne you to these champions, and tell them from me, there will be one in the field by and by, who taketh delight in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, &amp; will not refuse to breake a lance or two with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>. With this answere came backe the squire to the two cousins, whose embassage when the emperour had vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, he imagined with himselfe, these two knights must n√©eds be <hi>Marcomyr</hi> and <hi>Ozalias</hi> his cousin, whereof h√©e was exc√©eding glad: and sent <hi>Rifaran</hi> to take a view of them, who mounting quickly on horsebacke, found <hi>Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> disarmed at the entrance of his tent, and his cousin the Countie readie armed at al points, except his helmet, which was off his head, whom when he knew not, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded whether they were the challengers who had sent to defie the knights of the court: whereunto the lord of Liquia answered, They were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> men: to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> replied <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faran</hi> againe: You haue vndertaken a matter which you shall at your ease enioy but a small while, but I bel√©eue you haue done it expresly to m√©et with some one quicklie, who might apparantly represse and abate your pride. When it shall fall out so, quoth <hi>Linedes,</hi> we shall but k√©ep others companie, who when they cannot bring to passe their enterprises, remain only frustrate of their desseigns: therefore we pray you take no care for our affairs, or else goe arme your selfe: for it is the act of a knight to fight with his sword, and not with his tongue, otherwise you shall infringe the order which euery valiant man ought to hold deare as his life.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Rifaran</hi> had ended these words, he tooke his leaue of them to returne towards the Emperour, whom he assured it was not <hi>Marcomyr</hi> nor <hi>Ozalias:</hi> albeit they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:23383:50"/>
s√©emed to be both two braue and hardie knights, and could not be but some puissant and great personages, by their outward apparance. Then went forth many good knights to proue themselues against the County, who for all that carried away the honour from them all without any aid from <hi>Linedes</hi> at all, who all the while neuer laid hand to shield nor lance, so that the Emperour who was there in the field to see them run, said he neuer saw knight in his life that carried his lance better, nor ran with a better grace then did this champion, of whom he had much maruell, considering his smal corpulence and yong age. Through all the court there was almost none other sp√©ech but of the dexterity and fine cariage which he vsed in his Iousting, whereupon <hi>Rifaran</hi> and <hi>Lechefin</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to run against him: notwithstanding they would not doe it till the last day, to the end the County and <hi>Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> his cousin being vanquished by them, their Prowesse might be knowne, and spoken of aboue all those who should haue receiued any foile in the Iousting. But there came by chance thether some who put them out of that paine, as we shall hereafter declare.</p>

The prince marrying with the daughter of Castile, had issue of her thr√©e male, and two female, both at one burthen, and faire in all perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The elder of the brethren had to name <hi>Arnedes,</hi> who was a wise and valiant knight, and set all his delight in managing armes, and continuall exercise of matiall disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. Now king <hi>Lewis</hi> s√©eing his sonne was marriagea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, withdrew him one day aside into his chamber, where he began thus: My son, so extreame is the naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the good will I bear towards you, that I would by no means s√©eke to doe any thing which might not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent you as well as my selfe: this I speake, because your most honourable Grandfather of good memorie being in his latter age, gaue me charge to match you in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with the Emperour of Constantinoples daughter, to the end the children which should be borne of you both, might ressemble in some things their famous and so much renowned ancestors. Wherefore I am determined sp√©edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to send mine embassador to him for to sollicite this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, whereunto I bel√©eue he will giue consent most willingly, and well can I assure you my sonne, that this Princesse, named <hi>Philochrista,</hi> of age betw√©ene fift√©en and sixt√©ene yeares, is one of the fairest and most beautifull creatures, which nature euer brought forth vnder the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the spheares. <hi>Arnedes</hi> when he heard his father deale so secretly with him about such a matter, besought him humbly not to trouble himselfe any further therein, as yet, for he would put him in mind thereof another time more fit for the purpose: the king s√©eing him so cold, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the matter. But the yong prince who had heard of the

surpassing beautie of <hi>Philocrista</hi> (who had not her like in all the regions of the leuant) and of the d√©eds of Chiualrie done by knights in the court of the Emperour <hi>Cleodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr</hi> her father, he could neuer remoue her out of his mind, but in him from day to day, still encreased a most seruent desire to passe to Constantinople, with intent, if this lady liked him to demand her in mariage of her father, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto if he would not giue consent, to exploit such feats of armes in the countries of Gr√©ece, that the honour thereof should at his returne accompanie him homewards. Such was the proiect of his desseigne, which he imparted very willingly to <hi>Recindos</hi> his cousin, sonne to the Castilian king, &amp; a most valerous and hardie knight, who encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to put it in practise, that it might take effect: vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he would til death alwaies k√©epe him good &amp; loial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie: and the worst were, they could gouern themselues so wisely by disguising of their persons, places, and diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of language in this busines, that no man liuing should be able to descrie their persons, or discouer their drifts. The plot thus laid betw√©ene these two cousins, to take vpon them this voiage, he went strait to his father, who very willingly gaue him his leaue, vpon condition h√©e should stay as little while as might b√©e in those countries of the leuant.</p>
               <p>So kissing his father the kings hand, tooke his leaue in the secretst manner which might be, taking along with him but onely thr√©e or foure persons, with his dwarfe, and <hi>Recindos</hi> his cousin, whom he loued from the entierest of his heart. Towards Marsilia they made with as much sp√©ed as might be, where finding a ship ready for them equipped, they waighed ankers, and set sailes, but had the weather so contrary, that being wearie of trauelling the tempestuous sea, they were faine to put into the first port of Gr√©ece, and send awaie their ship by sea to m√©et them at Constantinople.

The County s√©eing a knight appeare vpon the barres, mounted presently on horsebacke, with a still presumption to coole quickly this assailants braua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe, but he was farre deceiued: for gallopping as fast as they could, they made such a furious encounter, that they brake their lances within their gantlets, finishing their carier without other harm: then said the countie to <hi>Arne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> Sir knight it is at your choice to haue another bout, if you think good. Content, I am readie, quoth the prince of France, s√©eing I haue done so little good with the first: then to shew their best before the emperour and other good knights who were there present, they made the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond encounter with a far greater furie then the first, in such sort, that the very earth s√©emed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

although they little deserue it: we are knights of the house of the king of France: for my part I am a n√©ere kinsman of <hi>Lewis</hi> duke of Burgondy.

Wherfore he called to him one of his squiers, commanding him to lay vpon the table all the rich iewels and rings, he had at that time, wherof he frankely gaue away the greatest to the good old man and to his daughter, praying him to marry her honourably, and he would furnish a sum of money for a dowery, and all other things necessarie for her marriage. From thence he tooke his iourney very secretly with <hi>Ozalias</hi> towards Constantinople, and lodged that night within two miles of the citie, where they aduised not to shew themselues, but only vpon the two first daies, and then to depart away to take their voiage towards the isle of Carderie.</p>

haue a sight of the princesse <hi>Philocrista,</hi> her to whom the conquest of his heart was already vowed. All thinges were in a readinesse and good order, when the Empresse came forth with <hi>Philocrista</hi> and her two other young daughters to accompanie the bride to church, who was so gorgeously attired with iewels and other rich orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts, and likewise the thr√©e infants with many other ladies of the blood roiall, that the great riches which was about their persons that day could not be valued: nor could any humane tongue, were it of the eloquent <hi>Demosthenes</hi> or <hi>Cicero,</hi> once approch to tel the worthy praise of their rare and perfect beauties, and especially that of the ladie <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locrista.</hi> Who comming in sight of prince <hi>Arnedes,</hi> did draw him into such admiration, that but he had s√©ene her, he could neuer haue bel√©eued she had beene endued with halfe so naturall perfection. For euen as the sun, the most excellent of all planets, shewing himselfe vpon the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, through the great &amp; inextinguible light of his beames dimmeth the light of all other starres, dazeling the eies of those who long time behold it, euen so was it with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant <hi>Philocrista,</hi> whose celestial portraiture, did obscure al other ladies n√©ere about her, and moreouer did much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the iudgement of <hi>Arnedes,</hi> who being confounded in his sensure, did est√©em the perfect beautie of this princesse farre aboue that of the goddesse, who appeared to <hi>Paris Alexander</hi> in the mountaines of Ida, when she had title to be fairest of the thr√©e.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Esquiuela</hi> and <hi>Philocrista</hi> arraied in this sumptuous manner, with all curiosity of iewels and womens orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, were mounted vpon two white hacknies, brauely harnessed and trapt to the ground with stones set in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and buckles of gold, finely wrought and embrodered ouer.

not the least, put himselfe on the other side to goe front by front with her, yet for all that, <hi>Arnedes</hi> (whom <hi>Cupido</hi> did impatiently maister) wrought so cunningly by his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourous deuises, that he got the place finely from him, whereby he might behold her better at his ease: whereat <hi>Lechefin</hi> fell in so meruelous an indignation, that from thence forward he began to beare him more then a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall grudge, perceauing thereby very well he loued her as well as himselfe. <hi>Recindos</hi> sorted himselfe with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant <hi>Melissa, Ditreus</hi> sister, for she s√©emed to him exc√©eding faire and gratious: with whom <hi>Rifaran,</hi> who was her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, made her quickly acquainted by saying: it was the knight who vanquished the earle, and that for his lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable vertues, he well deserued some fauour aboue the rest. By meanes wherof she began to make him discourse of many excellent matters, which she could do meruellous well by reason of the ripe vnderstanding and fine grace wherewith nature had enriched her. For she n√©eded not to betaught to vse her tongue affably and discr√©etly.</p>
               <p>Here by the way, <hi>Recindos</hi> was so enflamed with her loue, that as long as he liued, the heat so liuely kindled, dwelt in his heart that it could neuer be quenched after that time. Now if he were wel pleased in mind, the prince <hi>Arnedes</hi> was no lesse glad for his part, beholding himselfe in that pearle of beautie, which his deare ladie <hi>Philocrista</hi> inherited from the day of her birth: whom he gaue well to vnderstand by his curious and often looking on her, that he was her entire and perpetuall slaue, yet neuer was so bold to tell her the least word in the world thereof, such a strange humour felt he in his soule, which forbad him to speake.</p>
               <p>But in the meane time <hi>Lechefin,</hi> whose eies fed of her beautie, much gr√©eued at such an obiect, did rage with gr√©efe and intollerable phrensie, multiplying in his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack more and more the rage and hatred he bore against him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:23383:55"/>When all this honourable troupe was arriued within the principall church of the cittie, the solemnity of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was incontinent celebrated with great ceremonie, then after the same order it came, returned with as goodly pompe to the pallace where they did couer for the feast, which was so sumptuous and magnificent in all thinges, that it might almost compare with that of the gods, held at the mariage of <hi>Peleus</hi> and the goddesse <hi>Thetis.</hi> The ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were serued in, and the princes and princesses all set and placed in their order, then began a ioifull musicke in the which were instruments of all sorts: here might the louers behold their ladies, whereby they receiued an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c√©eding ioy in their hearts, which they could not dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble after dinner, when they shewed by the agility of their bodies in dauncing, the great desire euery one had to win the fauourable iudgement of his mistresse, to be reputed the finest reueller.</p>
               <p>In this iollitie past they that day away with great pleasure and content, till the houre the bridegroome and bride were to goe to bed: when the Empresse her selfe brought the Princesse <hi>Esquiuela</hi> into the bride chamber, where she left her in a bed, which was richly prepared for her, and the Emperor himselfe brought <hi>Ditreus</hi> into the same, and soone after euery one retired into his lodging: <hi>Arnedes</hi> amongst the rest, the ioisullest man liuing in his mind, brake thus with <hi>Recindos:</hi> How like you cousin, the beauty of <hi>Philocrista</hi>? did you euer s√©e a more rare and perfect p√©ece? Ah, I must n√©eds hasten the end of this my most vrgent businesse: to giue some howers of quiet rest to the anguish of my poore passionate heart, wherfore I am determined to dispatch a post to the king my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the end he send hether honourable embassadors, who shall conclude this marriage with the Emperour. Meane while I will sound the depth of this amourous ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and I will s√©e whether the knowledge and wisdome of the spirit of <hi>Philocrista</hi> be correspondent to her singuler
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:23383:56"/>
beautie: and if so be her inward vertue second the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, wherewith nature hath outwardly endued her, I may repute my selfe the most happie and fortunate knight, who liueth vnder the zones of the heauen, hauing her once in my power.</p>
               <p>Surely sir replied <hi>Recindos,</hi> you may truly praise her, and I pray vnto God in deuout and humble praier, our comming may succ√©ed as well in my behalfe, as I bel√©eue it will fall out shortly in yours: for as touching my mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if the grace and courtesie of <hi>Melissa</hi> doe not giue m√©e some succourable comfort, I may well assure you, it had bene better for me I had neuer set foot in these countries. Then <hi>Arnedes</hi> tooke him in his arms and embraced him, saying: O how glad and eased am I by these your words, which haue pleased my hearing aboue all other: S√©eing by them I s√©e you are my companion in all things, repose I pray you your firme hope in him, on whom depend all things, who by his deuine bounty shall direct our actions so well, that with time they shall sort a happie effect. And if it please him to fauor mine affairs that they cary aright and succ√©ed, I will worke yours till they compasse the matter you leuell at. Courage then, and let vs make the Gr√©eks know France br√©edeth as good knights and men of as great valor as any nation in the world.</p>
               <p>Upon these sp√©eches, they went to take their rest till the morrow, when the Emperour went forth into the fields with the Empresse and the new maried couple, who were conducted by the thr√©e infants to the scaffolds which were richly hanged with clothes of state &amp; tissue, where they might behold the triumph better at their ease. Hard were it to count the number of ladies, gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and others, who were assembled without the citty to view this goodly sight: the scaffolds were thorowly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished, and the presse on euery side the stages so great, that it could not hold halfe the people, for the knights on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who came within the lists to Ioust, made vp the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:23383:56"/>
of six thousand; all choice men and braue champions, when they began to come to hands, you might heare the aire ring on euery side with drums and trompets, which sounded the assault, and forthwith the combattants run together, crashing their lances, hacking and hewing one another with their cemitories and courtelaxes. There might you haue s√©ene a thousand blazing starres, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the glitring of so many braue frontstals, helmets, sheilds, and guilded armours, faire burnished and shining bright as the sun, or as the Carbuncles in a darke place. Then might you s√©e vpon their helmets so many rich plumes, mottoes, pensels and fauours, where hanged the deuises and coulors of the ladies of many knights, that it was an admirable thing to behold them: and most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for vs to recount all the other excellencies and sumptuosities of this assembly: neither is it of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of our historie to report.</p>
               <p>At the first encounter were many knights strangers laid along: the Courtiers behaued themselues gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and had surely carried away the honour of the day, had not <hi>Linedes</hi> and the Earle his cousin stept in, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling two furious lions, brusht them so thorowly on euery side (to be reuenged of the shame they had receaued by <hi>Arnedes</hi> meane) that no man durst come n√©ere them. These then did maintaine the field, and did meruellous feats of armes: but <hi>Arnedes</hi> who of purpose held on the contrarie part, s√©eing himselfe in presence of his deare Ladie <hi>Philocrista,</hi> in place where sh√©e might well iudge of his Chiualrie, thrust himselfe without feare into the thickest of them, and did meruailous actes with his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>Now the Emperour who knew well the valour and dexterity of the best, s√©eing the great and admirable feats of armes exploited by the readie addresse of his bodie, thought with himselfe the words of the lady who came into his court, would be now verified, to wit: that there
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:23383:57"/>
should arriue knights from strange countries who should surpasse his in magnanimitie and prowesse. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he did greatly reioice to s√©e <hi>Rifaran</hi> make his valor so well knowne amongst the rest, for he neuer couched launce in vaine, but some knight went to the ground. So violent was the martial furie of these men at armes who held on the Courtiers side, that their aduersaries had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ben able to stand before them, if <hi>Marcomyr</hi> and <hi>Oza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> had not by chance ioined to their succor. <hi>Ozalias</hi> came first to the conflict, where he began to strike such full stroakes, that quickly he made them know in what sports he knew best to employ the force of his armes and by and by arriued <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> carying a coat of armor red, and vpon a sheild in a gr√©ene field painted with a little flower argent, which he deuised for this purpose, because h√©e would not be knowne of <hi>Abeuunq</hi> nor of <hi>Rifaran,</hi> who had s√©ene him often in the other equippage. Before he entred into the Iousts, he staid a good while to behold the citie of Constantinople, then casting his eies very curiously one while vpon the Emperour his father, who sat aloft vpon the scaffolds, with many nobles and Barons round about him, another while vpon the empresse, and her ladies and gentlewomen, who were there to accompanie her, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled to s√©e there so great number of nobilitie and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, wherefore he said thus to himselfe: O soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne God, creator and director of all things, I find my selfe infinitely bounden to serue and obey you, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence you more then any other of your creatures, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing giuen me such a father, who beside he is reputed the best knight borne vnder the starres, you haue moreouer created him the greatest Prince who raigneth this day vpon the earth: now s√©eing you haue graunted me so ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimable a fauor to be borne of so rare and excellent a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage, I must do my best indeuour to resemble him, and to shew in somthing I am his son: for albeit I now Ioust against the knights of his court, I bel√©eue h√©e shall haue
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:23383:57"/>
none occasion to reprehend me in ought, when he shall know the good zeale I haue to doe him seruice in al other things: his courage encreased so much, as he had spoken these words, in s√©eing himselfe before the Emperor his father, that setting spurs to a strong courser which cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, he roughly entered the lists, where before he had broken his lance, he sent many knights to the ground, then began to lay about him so lustily, and with his great cemitorie to doe so many wonderfull acts, that those of his part taking courage, raunged themselues into order by him, and came vpon the courtiers till they abandoned the place. Knowing then <hi>Arnedes</hi> surpassed al the rest in feats of armes, he gaue him so sturdy a blow vpon the helmet, that he made him goe against his will astonished to the ground: at the same instant with another stroake smot <hi>Pernedin</hi> eldest son to the duke of Pera, besides his horse, who was est√©emed one of the brauest knights in all Gr√©ece. Which hardie <hi>Rifaran</hi> perceiuing, came vpon <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> his sword charged in his hand, wherewith he hit him two such blowes one after another, that he made him f√©ele the smart thereof a good while after: but he had quickly his reuenge: for <hi>Marcomyr</hi> was in such a fury a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him that he neuer left him till he had his paiment and was dismounted. Then angrie as a lion, he stroke on euery side with such a great might, that none durst stand before him. <hi>Recindos</hi> s√©eing his cousin <hi>Arnedes</hi> disarsoned, tooke in hand a great lance, to run against his aduersarie with a poulder: but <hi>Marcomyr</hi> spying him come towards him, tooke as good a one out of his squiers hands, (who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies attended n√©ere him with sword and lance to furnish him at his n√©ed) and running furiously one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they encountred as mortall enemies, <hi>Marcomyr</hi> pierced <hi>Recindos</hi> shield and armour, and giuing him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wound, bore him ouer his horse crouper to the ground: he was also a little wounded in his breast with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies sword, wherewith he was so mad, that with the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:23383:58"/>
first blow he stroke afterwards, he sent <hi>Lechefin</hi> to bear him companie in the place, who albeit he were but young in years, he was neuerthelesse skilfull in armes and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and till that hower had behaued himselfe most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly at all assaies.</p>
               <p>Who could euer declare the admirable chiualries <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comyr</hi> did in this martiall conflict? certainly the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror wondred much at them, (being ignorant who it might be) for he auered he neuer saw accomplished knight of so great prowesse. The like did <hi>Diocles,</hi> who had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame desire to know his name, wherevnto <hi>Abenunq</hi> answered, he thought it was <hi>Marcomyr</hi>: for quoth he, he resembleth him very much in the proportion of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Uery glad was the Emperor of that newes, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to send a messenger to desire him to conceale himselfe no longer, being so n√©ere him, but should come to make himselfe knowne in place where he was so much desired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abenunq</hi> would n√©eds goe himselfe with thr√©e or foure other knights in his companie, but he found it so hard to passe the throng, that he could neuer come n√©ere him, whereby he was constrained to returne without him. But <hi>Marcomyr</hi> hearing the voice of all the people giuing him the honor and price at the triumph, hauing thr√©e lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wounds, wherof the greatest was that which the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish prince gaue him<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> returned in hast to the good ould knights house, where he had lodged before. Whether <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zalias</hi> the same night retired also in good health, whereof <hi>Marcomyr</hi> was right glad: in this place he soiorned two daies to cure his wounds, from whence he tooke his way towards the kingdome of Macedon with the same arms he bare in the triumph, hauing <hi>Celestina</hi> continually in his thoughts.</p>

he endured all the length of his iourney. He past a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a great part of the night in thought of <hi>Philocrista,</hi> so that he little felt the Serena or any other night blastings, and in the morning betime betooke himselfe againe into his way, along which he demanded of all he met, if they had not s√©ene a knight wearing a coat of arms red, with a little Flower Argent vpon his sheild, but he found none who could tell him any tidings. So trauelled he on two daies, the second wherof he lodged in an hermitage built vpon the top of a little hill, where he tooke a poore but a ioifull refection: the morrow morning he tooke vp into a narrow way, not knowing well whether he went: and as he was a good bow-shoote from the hermitage, he disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered two knights comming a long way, which crossed ouer his, for whom he purposed to attend at the place where the waies met: recognishing <hi>Marcomyr</hi> as far off as he could discerne his shield: whereat he was the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest man in the world, hoping by force or faire meanes to bring him to Constantinople: therefore he stept out and thus saluted him.</p>
               <p>Sir knight I hold my selfe highly fauored by fortune, hauing here met with you now, who for none other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion am departed from the Emperor <hi>Cleodomyrs</hi> court, but to s√©eke you, and that for so much as he hath a singuler desire to vse you courteously with the kindest entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he can make you, since he saw you last in the tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. So that I pray you for the courtesie and amitie you may beare him, to come now with me, to the end I may acquite my promise, by which I find my selfe for the same effect bound to his maiestie. You haue done euil qd. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comyr,</hi> to promise a thing which dependeth of anothers will, for at this present (hauing very vrgent affaires a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad otherwise) I cannot obey his will, albeit I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to doe him seruice in all other things, as I lately sent him word, and as I request you to tell him againe from me. Knight replied <hi>Arnedes,</hi> I pray you take a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

resolution herein, and thinke these words doe in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing discharge me of mine obligation, wherefore deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine with your selfe to come quickly with me with a good will, otherwise you must goe thether by force. By force neuer, replied <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> but of mine owne accord thether will I goe when I shall thinke good. I requested you for your owne good quoth <hi>Arnedes,</hi> and your valor did induce me to pardon the hatred and grudge I beare you, notwithstanding s√©eing you will come to none other point, prepare your self to the combat, and thinke not the reputation of the discomfiture you gaue me in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph the other day can auaile you here any thing.</p>
               <p>S√©eing you force me quoth <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> yours b√©e the wrong, for as for me for the loue of the Emperor, I haue no desire to sight with you. This said, they encountred so violently, that it s√©emed the earth should open vnder their coursers, and breaking their lances in a thousand p√©eces, they went both to the ground, where <hi>Arnedes</hi> had his shield and armor pierced thorow with his aduersaries sword, (which he caried alwaies with a sharpe edge) and moreouer a wound in his breast: for al that he was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vp againe and running with a great viuacity of sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke roughly vpon him with his naked sword, fought with him couragiously a good while, making him to know what was the amitie he bore him. But by reason of the great abundance of blood which gushed out of his wound, his heart began much to faile him, by meanes whereof <hi>Marcomyr</hi> had him so much at aduantage, that in the end he gaue him a mighty blow downeright vpon his creast, wherewith he fell downe astonied in the place: which when he saw, he cared not to giue him any more, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had made cleane his sword, which was all bloodie, he put it vp into his sheath, saying: I bel√©eue you will haue little list to force any knight hereafter, but you will remember your paiment at this time: then remounting on horsebacke (albeit he was hurt in the encounter) h√©e
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:23383:62"/>
pursued his way with <hi>Ozalias,</hi> who highly commended <hi>Arnedes</hi> for an act of a right good and hardy knight, which he had s√©ene him doe in this combat.</p>
               <p>But the Hermit who beheld the battaile, moued with charitie and compassion, made apace downe the hil to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour <hi>Arnedes</hi> who lay all along vpon the grasse, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying the strings of his helmet, he puld it off his head to know in what state he was in, whereby it fortuned that the vigor of the sun sending downe his beams perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly vpon his face, restored him in an instant &amp; made all his spirits come to him againe. Then s√©eing no more the knight who was conqueror in the ioust, (but an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite hard by him) he iudged him to be very courteous and humane, who would not kill him outright, being in his power so to doe: yet felt extreame paine and was in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement choller to s√©e himselfe so foiled and hardly vsed, not so much for his wound, as for the fortune of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie which had ben so contrarie to him, that he began to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this pittifull maner: What should I now doe, but complaine of the inconstancie of fortune? Am not I accursed to come into these countries to purchase fame and renowne, and haue as yet done no act, which doth not redound more to my shame and ignominie then to any honour and praise of Chiualrie? Ah s√©eing my forces will not be correspondent to the courage of my heart, and I cannot otherwise demeane my selfe more valiantly, it were better I surcease the exercise of Chiualrie, then so il to employ my selfe in the vpholding and augmentation of so noble estate.</p>
               <p>Further would he haue prosecuted the exclamation of his bad fortune, detesting the enormitie of his life, when the Hermite exhorted and comforted him in this maner: My son, thanke our Lord who hath deliuered you out of the knights hands, who hauing you at such aduauntage, hath shewed himselfe very pittifull and mercifull, in that he did not seperate your soule from your bodie. Cease I

bes√©ech you these discourses, which cannot auaile you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then to nourish in your heart anguish and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but thinke vpon God, who in a moment can make you inuincible, and giue you all your hearts desires. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing said thus, he wrapped vp his wounds as well as h√©e could, thinking to conduct him more easily afterward to his Hermitage: but as the diuel would haue it (one mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance commeth seldome alone) euen as he was getting vp on horsebacke, there arriued <hi>Lechefin,</hi> who bare him a mortall grudge for the loue of <hi>Philocrista.</hi> Who knowing him well, and s√©eing him in so euill taking, was verie glad of his m√©eting, to the end to be reuenged at his good aduantage: for otherwise he had not the heart to haue met him face to face. Wherefore comming n√©ere him, he began with this prowd and presumptuous language: I declare th√©e as much my capitall and disloiall enemie, as thou louest her, whom thou art not so much as worthie to serue: this much I hope I shall make th√©e quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse: and pay dearly for thy rashnes and too audacious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in addressing thy loue to a ladie, whose least grace of a thousand, surmounteth in merit the most braue and excellent of all French men.</p>
               <p>These words ended, he couched his lance thinking to naile him fast to the earth, which he had assuredly done if <hi>Arnedes</hi> (who saw himselfe ouertaken thus vnprouided) had not shrunke a little on the left hand, whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to play his part so nimbly that in trauersing euery way he gaue his aduersaries horse such a sound blow, that he laid them both vnder f√©et: by which meane h√©e had leisure to put his helmet on his head: for he supposed it stood him greatly vpon to defend himselfe. In the mean time <hi>Lechefin</hi> leapt vp quickly againe, sore brused with the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:23383:63"/>
with a courage almost inuincible to deliuer him manie shrewd and daungerous strokes, which did so much the more augment the f√©eblenes of his members, wherby h√©e could not long time hold out against him.</p>
               <p>The good Hermite who perceiued him loose his blood thus, put himselfe incontinent betw√©ene them, praying <hi>Lechefin</hi> for the honor of God to hold his hand, for that the knight of himselfe did much abridge his owne life: but <hi>Lechefin</hi> who was a Moore, and by that mean more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable, would in no waies heare him, but raging in great choller, stroke the poore Hermit such a blow vpon his head, that he claue it asunder downe to his t√©eth. Ah, thou traitor and disloiall dog (quoth <hi>Arnedes,</hi> s√©eing the act of so pittifull a tragedie) ah, what blood<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Saying this, he goeth courageously to charge him with thr√©e so strange blows, that he made him f√©ele the last smart: neuerthelesse by reason of the blood which streamed incessantly from his wound (especially at the chafing and choller of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge) he waxed instantly so weake and f√©eble, that if the pitie and mercie of God had not succoured him, he had ben verily cut off by the hands of this infidell Moore.</p>
               <p>There did the soueraine dominator of this round Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, shew a most miraculous aduenture, bringing the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iust at that hower <hi>Pernedin</hi> the duke of Peraes son, one of those who had enterprised the quest of <hi>Marcomyr</hi>: who as soone as he had recognished the two combattants (all amazed to s√©e them two in fight together) came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tw√©ene them, crying out with a lowd voice: Eternall God what meaneth this? Haue you thus sworne your owne death knight? Then <hi>Arnedes</hi> who could no longer stand on his legs, falling downe on the ground, breathed out this complaint: Alas <hi>Pernedin,</hi> I bes√©ech th√©e auenge

               <p>These words made <hi>Lechefin</hi> so ashamed, that being mounted quickly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>

But when the Nunnes knew he followed the Emperours court, they did him all the honour they could deuise, and one of them who was learned and wel experienced in the art of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke and Chirurgerie, tooke charge to tend him careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vntil his perfect recouerie, and there she remained some daies with him before she could recouer him to his former health.</p>

                  <hi>Pernedin</hi> was very sorrowfull and displeased much, s√©eing the good Hermit slaine, and the knight most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously hurt: notwithstanding with the helpe of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, who helped daily the old Hermit to masse, he brought

               <p>Greatly wondred <hi>Amenada</hi> hearing him tell how so high and illustrious a prince had thrust himselfe into so many trauels and dangers for the accomplishment of this mariage, which he might haue effected by his agents em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied therein. Then she made this answere, Assuredly if I had not promised to tell my ladie and mistresse this, I should not dare for any thing in the world aduenture my selfe to discouer or manifest so great matters as these, for I should neuer be able to shew her the one halfe, but <hi>Melissa</hi> who neuer stirreth farre from her, would vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand or presume something.

               <p>This countesse was a widdow, and had b√©ene but two yeares without her husband, who in the end of his daies, for that he had no children, and loued his wife with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular affection, made her the inheretrix of all his estate and siegnorie: whereat was greatly wroth a brother of the earls, called <hi>Diolas,</hi> a fierce and hardy knight, who as a yonger brother, was little the better by succession of his father, but for a small farme, being al he could pretend for his part, and willingly would he haue made warre vpon his sister, had he not s√©ene her well beloued of all her vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals.

if she did not forsake quickly that possession sh√©e held vniustly (surrendring it willingly into his hands) he would cast her out by force and violence: as he who next after the death of the deceased earle his brother, ought by right and reason to inherit.</p>
               <p>The countesse was in a great perplecity through these threatning sp√©eches, yet determined to defend her selfe, if he went about to molest her, and by good fortune the same day <hi>Rifaran</hi> came that way, when <hi>Diolas</hi> went the round without the fortresse, with fiue other knights well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to espie the f√©eblest part where they might scale and surprise it.

But <hi>Rifaran</hi> being valerous, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect warrior, shewed within a little space, he would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carie away the victorie, for he made his fight with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous dexterity, &amp; neuer profered blow but hurt his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie: so as in lesse then halfe an hower he tamed him so well, that with a stroake which he lighted aloft on the creast of his helmet, he made him fal from his horse to the ground: Then <hi>Rifaran</hi> alighted from his, and running hastely vpon him, cut a two the laces of his helmet, and withall his head from his shoulders, saying to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse, who looked on thorow the loopeholes of the platform: Madame, now are you secure from the vexation which this peasant did worke you, so that from henceforth you n√©ed not feare him any more.</p>
               <p>The ladie was much abashed at his suddaine spectacle, and much more affraid were <hi>Diolas</hi> fiue knights, who s√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their maister alreadie dead, came like mad dogs to charge vpon <hi>Rifaran,</hi> crying to him: thou art dead, cruel and inhumane Barbarian, s√©eing thou hast not had pittie of a better and more courteous knight then thy selfe. H√©e knowing it was time to bestir something els then his tongue, and not to be all day in doing it, put himselfe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:23383:71"/>
brauely in defence: when with the first stroake of his sword, he sent one of them to k√©epe <hi>Diolas</hi> company in the other world. But the other foure held him so liuely play, that he receiued two or thr√©e wounds, yet not mortall nor dangerous, for he droue them so before him, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one nor other could once come n√©ere him, but they should find him ready to receiue them. And although they gaue him his hands full, as doubtlesse the match is too vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall of foure against one, yet he neuer shewed himselfe coward or fainthearted, but in warding stil their blows, mist not their bodies an inch, at euery aduantage where they lay open, and he made the sweat drop down his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head for feare, whom he could sometimes by chance light vpon.</p>
               <p>The countesse s√©eing her champion in perill of death, sent many of her people to his rescue, so that there salied out of the fortresse more then twentie knights all very well armed to goe sacage and take prisoners those foure assailants: for all that, they could take but two of them al hewen and massacred of their bodies, whom they caried afterwards within the castle: for as for the others, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry feare had made to take their h√©eles so soone as they saw the supplie of enemies come forth of the castell to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile them. In the meane while two young knights, kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the countesse, came humbly to thanke <hi>Rifaran,</hi> and to inuite him to refresh himselfe within the fortresse, as well because it was n√©edfull for him to rest, as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the ladie and mistresse thereof had a great desire to know him, and to doe him all the honour she might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, for the suddaine and miraculous aid she had receiued at his hand. Gentleman quoth the knight then, smal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are these I haue now exploited, in respect of that I would endeuour to accomplish, as far as my life would goe, for her and her p√©eres. Notwithstanding I will goe willingly to visit her, to the end to doe her that reuerence which I ow to all the honest and vertuous paragons of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:23383:71"/>
her sex. So he walked forth towards the castle, and as he drew n√©ere it, behold the countesse who met him, who thanking him in most humble manner for the knightly act he came from performing in the defence and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of her good right, required him most instantly and with a very amiable grace he would declare her his name, to that end her spirits might be setled, knowing him by whom she had receiued this aid.</p>
               <p>Madame quoth <hi>Rifaran,</hi> I am a gentleman of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours court, whence I am come not long since to s√©eke a knight who departed thence very secretly this other day: and arriuing here by chance as you may s√©e, I could not endure you should be thus villanously outraged by your aduersarie, against whom I haue as I thinke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all blame attempted that which euery aduised and noble knight is bound to doe in the like occurrence. With this talke they mounted vp the staires of the great hall, where being arriued, the countesse did with her owne hand disarme <hi>Rifaran,</hi> then laid him in a rich bed, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his wounds to be looked vnto with all care, giuing commaund the same euening to make an honourable tombe, to inter therein the bodie of <hi>Diolas</hi> her brother in law, with ceremonies of funerall pomps, as were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit, for the yonger brother issued of so high a house as that of Iseland. And afterward causing al her vassals to b√©e as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, she aduised that <hi>Rifaran</hi> and the two knights which she held prisoners should recount vnto them the discourse of this battaile, the happie issue whereof made them more then content: In respect whereof they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine sware and promised vnto her loiall fidelitie, and she remained in tranquillity and peaceable possession of her estate. So that hereby her thoughts being no more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the continuall vexations and alarmes that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olas</hi> was wont to giue her, she occupied her selfe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in tricking vp of her naturall beautie, and in doing of things which might please the knight, whom she per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:23383:72"/>
alreadie a little entangled in her loue, which on the other side fiered her owne thereby with an vnquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble flame, hauing vnderstood he was nephew to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse of Constantinople, but she knew not he was a Moore: this reciprocall amitie grew so hot betw√©ene them, that it rauished quite the spirits of this countesse, euen to make her forget the chast and vndefiled lawes of her widdowhood: for the impatient desire of <hi>Rifaran,</hi> and the guerdon of his merit, whereof she was in silent manner required, did prouoke her so liuely that sh√©e was persuaded to let her heart swim in the streame of all deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ioissance: so it fell out afterward by the subtiltie and secret practises of <hi>Cupid,</hi> wherof not any liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but they two, and one of her most faithfull ladies of honour were priuie: and <hi>Rifaran</hi> loued her afterward so strangely, that for the loue of her, fearing least his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might cause her sorrow &amp; insupportable griefe, he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourned a great while longer in that place then h√©e was determined to doe.</p>

               <p>To returne to the prince of Tarsus, as soone as <hi>Tira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel</hi> saw him approch the bridge, he made out against him, as he did against all others who in great number re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted continually into this place, rather to combat with <hi>Belcarin</hi> then to trie themselues in the aduenture of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestina,</hi> and had alreadie vanquished six since his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons departure: whereof <hi>Marcomyr</hi> aduertised at his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the night before, resolued rather to die then to take the place of the seuenth. Wherefore he laced his helmet, then gallopping to the end of the carrier (for at the other end he beheld <hi>Tiraquel</hi> all in a readines) gaue him such a

braue encounter, that with a shrewd blow he sent him to the ground: for all that he lost one of his stirrops by the counterbuffe which he receiued of <hi>Tiraquel,</hi> who lay there a good while before he could rise againe, he felt such paine by his fall.</p>
               <p>Those who beheld this encounter meruelled much, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the Qu√©ene of Thessalie, <hi>Celestinaes</hi> mother, who arriued there foure or fiue daies before: for that the last of the thr√©e Fairies who wrought the enchantme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t of the castle, fores√©eing she could not liue longer, procured the arriuall of <hi>Marcomyr</hi> as before you haue read, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward sent the qu√©ene word that soon after her decease she should s√©e all her desires accomplished.

Notwithstanding he who saw himself in eminent peril of life, fearing to be torne in p√©eces and deuoured by these beasts (which s√©emed to him more terrible and mad then the infernall furies) began to lay at them with downright blowes, and then thrust vpon thrust so liuely, that he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wearied himselfe then hurt them in any wise, for that his sword could not pierce their skin, being diobollically enchanted. Wherefore not well knowing what to doe in this perplexitie, he said in great brauerie, How is this?

Ah too great an enemie should be to me that old mortall Chimere, if she should make an end of me here before her, in whom lieth the perfection of all my future glorie. As soone as he had ended this sp√©ech, letting his sword hang at the chaine of his arme, and taking in either hand one of these sauage and horrible beastes, he put them finely vnder his armepits, where he thratled them so hard, that they were quickly strangled: neuerthelesse he remained so wearie and senceles, that scantly could he well stand vpon his f√©et a good while after.</p>

And as she shewed (still in her going) many signes of congratulation to her louer, the knight certified her how ten or twelue daies past her officers arriued at the end of the bridge, and she her selfe the next morrow after accompanied with many Barons and ladies, whereof <hi>Marcomyr</hi> was well a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that her spirits vncapable to conceiue it, she fell downe in a traunce betw√©ene <hi>Ozalias</hi> armes, who had almost born her companie through the content and ease suddainely stroken into his heart, s√©eing <hi>Marcomyr</hi> seated vpon the top of Fortunes wh√©ele.

wherefore faire knight (whom God blesse from all mischance) s√©eing you haue brought into so great gladnes the soule which floated among the waues of this tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous sea of aduersity, restoring <hi>Celestina</hi> into my hands, so also I must entreat you with an affection proc√©eding from a heart, which shall f√©ele it selfe for euer bounden to you, to doe so much that this ioy may be entire and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, to giue me her father as he is by the fatall destiny appointed: to the end we may liue together the rest of our old age in al tranquility of spirit.</p>
               <p>The knight had great pittie on the qu√©ene, and quickly tooke her vp by the hand, saying: Madame, I pray you vex not your selfe any further, for I haue determined to die or to worke these matters so about, that you shall passe the rest of your old yeares with more content then of the qu√©ene of Thessalie may be imagined. Then the good ladie thanked him, and kissing his ch√©eke very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously she replied thus againe: I bel√©eue vndoubtedly my son, you wil assuredly hold your promise, s√©eing our Lord hath so wel acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>plished you in all things, that he doth not permit you to speak ought with your mouth but your hart is pricked with a desire ready to perform it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vttermost.</p>

delightfull and a place of pleasant recreation. By meanes whereof, they remained there thr√©e daies with as much pleasure and solace, as any humane spirit might wish: nor could they saciat themselues with beholding the strange things, especially those of the dongeon wherein <hi>Celestina</hi> had bene so long time enclosed: wherby it chaunsed that <hi>Marcomyr</hi> finding the seat of this isle in so good and fertile a climat, purposed to transport thither a colonie of people out of his kingdome of Tarsus, to inhabit it the better, and to the end also this countrie might immortalise the remembrance of him and of <hi>Celestina,</hi> to the future ages of his posteritie.</p>
               <p>There were they serued sumptuously, and with all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance by the siegnior of the island, but the qu√©en could not glut her selfe in beholding her daughter, and talking to <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> who loued her surely no lesse then her selfe did: in such manner that they two one day being both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether far in talke, he praied the qu√©ene most louingly to conduct her daughter to Constantinople, to put her on his behalfe vnder the protection of the Emperor, whom sh√©e should tell moreouer, that so soone as he could dispatch his voiage into Turkie, he would kisse his hand, and so acquit himselfe of that promise, which he had by the mouth of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers made vnto him diuerse times. Lord <hi>Marcomyr</hi> qd. the qu√©ene then, I will with all my heart doe that which you prescribe me, yet would I faine know, whether you meane to goe against the Turke with a puissant armie, for as much as if the case stand so, I will send into Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salie for as many companies as you will haue, and for a n√©ed will demaund aid at the Emperours hand, who will succour m√©e willingly with so many legions as I would demand.</p>
               <p>Madame replied <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> my mind is to take none other companie with me, then such as I brought hether, considering this busines shall be brought to an end, rather by aduenturous hazard, than by any forces which I may

march into the field: and were all those of the Emperour vnited together, they shall not be able to bring it so quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about. Neuertheles, s√©e here my resolution: You must vnderstand how I met not long since at sea with the king of Culacin son in law to the great Turke, beating vp &amp; downe the coast of Thrace, accompanied with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rouers, and a great consort of like faction, that with all his power he might endomage the Empire: I tooke him by faire war, and sent him forthwith fast bound and manacled as an arch pyrat and king of Rouers vnto the power of the Emperour. If perhaps I cannot by my car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and secret drists preuaile in mine attempts, being in that countrie, I will politickly s√©eke to make exchange of these two kings, vnder pretext of some good and colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable practises. In br√©efe, I will worke as the occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of time and place will giue me leaue: wherein I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s√©ech the diuine bountie to shew me the sp√©ediest and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctest course, whereby I may quickly bring to a fortunate end this my so affectionat desire.</p>
               <p>Exc√©eding glad was the Qu√©ene to heare of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of the king of Culacin, so that being put in great comfort through this hope, she hastened with al diligence the departure of <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> thinking euery day as long as a thousand yeares till she saw at libertie the king her husband: the same thought <hi>Celestina</hi> also, who with her amorous becks and signs shewed vnto her louer al the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour she could deuise, for that neuer going from her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they could not giue such contentment to their hearts as they desired in amorous talke and deuise only: &amp; more priuie habitude then kissing, had not as yet bene permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their sportings, nor did it happen at all till the day of their mariage, when <hi>Marcomyr</hi> vndid the impolluted girdle of hir virginitie, which till that day she had euer worne vntouched.</p>

And who had taken <hi>Arnedes</hi> for the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle shepheard <hi>Paris Alexander,</hi> his deare ladie <hi>Philocrista</hi> should full soone haue ben in possession of him: because loue did so sway his heart, that he found her the perfectest of al, though <hi>Celestina</hi> excelled her in some gifts of fauor: so that all the assistants concluded by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mon resolution, they had neuer s√©en a fairer lady, except the Empresse whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> she was in flower of her yong yeares.

The emperour intreated <hi>Celestina</hi> to tell him who this <hi>Marcomyr</hi> was, if she could shew him so much: whom the princesse answered very modestly, If it please your grace, I cannot giue you any thing to vnderstand of him, but this, he commaundeth a kingdome and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seigmories of very great estate, and when I should know of him more, yet were I to be excused though I did not discouer so much (for it is his pleasure to conceale it) till he come himselfe in person to manifest his countrie and his progenie.</p>
               <p>For this modest answer was <hi>Celestina</hi> greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended of the emperour, who iudged her to be very wise and well aduised, when he began to behold h√©edfully her gestures: so that spieng on her finger the ring which her louer gaue her to keepe in testimonie of his seruice, he d√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it presently to be much like that whereof the qu√©ene of Tarsus made him a present at his departure from her.

penuance which you shall please to put him vnto: and for my part I promise to shew you such courtesie, as you shal one day haue occasion to thanke me for that it was my hap to moue you therein.</p>
               <p>To that will I neuer consent while I liue (qd. the damsel) for I had rather s√©e <hi>Belcarin</hi> die presently before my eyes, then to haue the monarchie of the thr√©e parts of the world vnder my power, considering the hainous and detestable treason whereby he hath so villanously abused my father, and all his posteritie: and lesse will I euer absolue my knight of the promise which he hath made me. The king entreated her once more with great instancie, and so did likewise all those who did accompanie him: neuertheles it was all in vaine, for she was so fixed in her most deadly grudge, that she tooke no pleasure in any thing, but in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerating the hainousnesse of the case.</p>
               <p>When the qu√©ene (who felt her selfe in a great agonie through the perill wherein she saw <hi>Belcarin</hi> was) vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the refusall of this damsell vpon the truce and accord of the two knights, she herselfe went to speake to her with the duches of Pontus, and the princesse <hi>Alderine</hi> her daughter, entreating altogether that she would acquite <hi>Recindos</hi> of his promise, and the qu√©ene would retain her for one of the ladies of honour of her house. But all those entreatings auailed no more then those of the king, to mooue that inexorable damsell to pittie, whom when the qu√©ene saw her so full of mutinie and crueltie, she swore in great anger, vnlesse she would pardon quickely both the knights, she would make her die a shamefull death, for there was a murmuring before, that the accusation layd against <hi>Belcarin,</hi> was false and malicious. The Damsell hearing the qu√©ene speake in so great a rage, was greatly affeard, and had also some compassion on the tears which she saw stream incessantly downe faire <hi>Alderins</hi> ch√©eks, so that alighting from her palfrey, she prostrated her selfe at the qu√©ens <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:23383:92"/>The knight was very glad of this good hap, accepted of him for the master of the ship: and not concluding any thing toward what coast they should first set saile, at the last aduised to thrust into the n√©erest hauen to the cittie of Tubanta: wherefore he demanded the Turke, if there were any port there abouts, which was a good and safe harbor. Sir quoth he, I will carrie you if you will into a cr√©eke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sea very secret, where very seldome come any great vessels: for that on the shore there is none other then that of my father, who fisheth there abouts: &amp; this cr√©eke lieth within one daies iourney of Tubanta, and within another of the castel of Albase, in which the great Turke holdeth at this present the king of Thessaly priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and al his treasur, vnder the guard of a hardy knight who is captaine thereof. And well can I assure you sir knight, there is not any handfull of earth in all that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which I know not (as well by night as by day) as wel as the coasts of the hauen, whereof I speake vnto you now: Where you may remaine in safetie, and doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer you shall please, no man to say you nay in any thing, for the benefit which I now receiue at your hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcomyr</hi> was still more ioiful, s√©eing so good a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning laid before hand for the execution of the matter h√©e went about, therefore he praied his Turke that he would make a short cut of it. All his equippage was soone in a readinesse, and as good luck serued, hoising vp his saile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, a prosperous and fauorable gale blew them so far, that in few daies they came to surge in the coast of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banta, and afterward to cast anckers in the same port. There went the Turkish mariner a shore to giue order to prepare a chamber for the knight, and finding not his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at home, aduertised his mother and two yonger bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren he had, who shewed themselues very glad of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne: but far gladder was <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> s√©eing himselfe in so secret and remote a place, moreouer n√©ere the castell of

Albase, wherein was captiue the king of Thessaly whom he sought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orican</hi> was the Turkish mariners name, who hauing told his mother of the great fauour that the knight whom he conducted had done him, returned aboord presently, praying <hi>Marcomyr</hi> to come a shore to refresh himselfe a little in their house, which he willingly did, being wearie and annoied with the pestred aire of the ship: after that he had equipped himselfe with his rich blacke armor which the Fairies left him in the castell of Carderie, and with the sword which had force to enchant and cast in sl√©epe whomsoeuer he would, by vnsheathing it: It was a large one, and short like a cemitorie, but grauen very artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and guilded, garnished beside with thr√©e sorts of ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, whereof she sheath was made of the one, the hilts and the pommell of another, and the handell of a most rare and pretious Calamite that might be found, the blade of most pure and fine st√©ele, and the best temper that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer giuen to a sword: in briefe it was iudged the rarest p√©ece of worke that euer was s√©en in that kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oricans</hi> mother receiued <hi>Marcomyr</hi> and <hi>Ozalias</hi> with the greatest entertainement and welcome she could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, and in the euening came home the old fisherman who was very glad to s√©e his sonne whom he accounted forlost and forlorne: notwithstanding he was much abashed to s√©e what companie he had gotten and made to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore, to entertaine them after marriners manner in so poore a house as his. And as he began to aske of his wife whence proc√©eded this good fortune, <hi>Marcomyr</hi> demanded of him from what part he came, whervnto the good man answered him very courteously: from a cittie sir, not far distant, whether I went this morning to sell some fish, which I made away quickly, because there is assembled a great number of knights to be present at the mariage of the daughter of the lord thereof, whom he marieth to the sonne of the captaine of Albase: &amp; there
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:23383:93"/>
I staid some what the longer, to the end to s√©e the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome and a sister of his which he brought with him who is est√©emed the most beautifull and the finest yong Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of all the round world. The which is of very many great lords demanded in mariage, but she will not accept of any, saying that she wil neuer marie with any but with him, who shall deserue her by his Prowesse and dexterity of armes: so that many braue and valiant knights are come to s√©e her for this intent, and haue ordained vpon the third day of the feast, a triumph for the loue of her, who in the mean space goeth so pompously attired, that she draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into great admiration all those who looke vpon her: &amp; I tell you sir, there is such a concourse of people, that it s√©emeth to be the court of the great turke with his bassoes and Ianissaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcomyr</hi> who listened to him most attentiuely, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned some little while pensiue, and afterward bethought himselfe, if he might but once by his subtil deuises enamor this Damsell, he might easily at his pleasure enter into the castell of Albase, where he should haue better meane to set abroch his statagems <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The morrow morning <hi>Marcomyr</hi> made the fisherman know he would be one at the triumph, by reason whereof he bestowed something on him in gift, praying him to haue in speciall regard his ship and mariners: then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted accompanied with <hi>Ozalias</hi> and <hi>Orican,</hi> who was his guide and did him much seruice in his practises about this busines. They were not far gone before they met by the way one of <hi>Leifidaes</hi> pages (so was the Damsels name who was daughter to the lieutenant of Albase, for whom they should Ioust) who was sent from his mistres to goe s√©e a sister of hers maried there n√©ere at hand, lying
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:23383:93"/>
then in childbed. <hi>Marcomyr</hi> comming towards him, gaue him a courteous and affable salutation, &amp; demanded of him if the triumph were held the next day following. Yea ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily quoth the yong youth, at least they haue all so agr√©ed, and if you come thether you shal find many hardy knights within the palissadoe: but I bel√©eue the partakers of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polo</hi> (so is the name of the bridegrome) wil cary away the honor of the tourney, because many hardie and valiant champions are come to this feast for the loue of <hi>Lefida</hi> his sister my mistresse, and to the end to find better meane to present him their seruice, would take his brothers part being one of the chiefest in the triumph.</p>
               <p>Then the prince recalling in mind the perfections of his <hi>Celestina,</hi> breathed forth a d√©epe fetcht sigh, and on the other side was maruelous glad to haue met with the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of this damsell: wherefore by this meane to win his acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce, he proc√©eded thus with him. Gentleman I may d√©eme the excellent graces of your mistresse to b√©e so amiable, that in an instant they will captiue and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap those who doe behold it, but I can well assure you, there is one readie with his entire will and most sincere affection to serue her, who neuer yet appeared before her face: which I speake for my selfe, who abandoning the place of my natiuitie, haue trauersed (wish almost insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable trauell) many and diuers countries, to come he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make her vnderstand the extreame deuotion I haue to be her perpetuall and faithfull seruant. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto only the renowne of her excellent beautie, which I thinke hath pierced thorow the whole circuit of the earth, hath induced me. And s√©eing my good hap is so fauorable at this present as to m√©et you so fitly, albeit you know m√©e not yet, and that I haue towards you merited nothing, I would neuerthelesse of fauor entreat one thing of you, which you should doe for me: by the effect whereof beside you shall purchase notable reputation of courtesie and gentlenes, which all noble borne of your age ought to

They found there, all a large plaine couered quite ouer with pauillions: where <hi>Marcomyr</hi> chose out for himselfe a place which liked him best, commaunding to erect there a rich and faire tent.</p>
               <p>In the meane time the young man tooke honestly his leaue, and entred full glad into the citie, where was heard of euery side great triumph and magnificence, for that was the first day of the mariage. <hi>Leifida</hi> had no sooner spied him, but she asked what newes from her sister?

When he saw her withdraw her selfe late in the euening into her cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ber (knowing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> or neuer was the fitest time to deliuer his other message) he followed her at an inch for the same purpose, &amp; taking her aside a litle fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> hir damsels, as though he would haue imparted some secret to her fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> hir sister, he made the whole discourse vnto her as <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr</hi> had informed him. I cannot bethink me qd. she then, who may this knight be who hath ben so hardy as to send me these presumptuous messages, being he saith he is a stranger, &amp; that he hath for my loue abandoned his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>try.

As for his courtesie and liberality, behold here (in shewing her the earnest of their deathes, albeit nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them thought thereof) what largesse he hath vsed, causing to be deliuered me by his Squiers these rich pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents which he hath giuen me.</p>
               <p>Truly I wonder much replied the Damsell, that this

knight commeth from so far a countrie to s√©e me, well might I be reputed very ingratefull (whosoeuer he be) if I did not thinke well of his so great trauell. Therefore faile not to shew me him to morrow, so soone as h√©e shall enter within the lists, to the end I may marke well his doings.</p>

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:23383:95"/>
Then assembled the knights together which were for both parties, about two thousand, all men of cheife, and very braue champions, and being entred within the bars, euery one began to shew his prowesie and dexteritie: but because the number of valerous champions was far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the bridegroomes part then on the contrarie side, they fetcht about the aduersaries so well, that they had borne away the price of the battel, if <hi>Marcomyr</hi> and <hi>Oza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> had not come into the bickering: who knowing this kind of skirmish a little better then those of that Region, made themselues known what maner of men they were by the trial that they made of them, especially <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> who emploied himselfe in such maruellous d√©eds of arms, that before the page sayd any thing, <hi>Leifida</hi> knew him by his incomparable exploits, whereof she and all the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers on, were in a great woonder: because if hee shocked fiercely, yet he knew better to manage and voltidge his horse, so well, that there was no knight who durst stand before him, so that at last being thorowly heated, as a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger following his prey, he chased all his enemies to the retreit. Then s√©eing the tourney ended to his honour, h√©e returned into his tent with <hi>Ozalias,</hi> who had behaued himselfe also for his part very valiantly, but they did not disarm themselues till night, mistrusting least they would s√©eke to lay some ambuscado for them: as happeneth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in such sports and pastimes, when the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed being prouoked with malice and enuie, conspire to lay rods in pisse against the vanquishers.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Ripolo</hi> perceiued his people were put to foile and vanquished, he was very angrie in his stomacke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he loued affectionatly <hi>Leifida</hi> his sister, and doubted least she would impute the fault to proc√©ed from him: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding she had not her heart vpon any other thing but on the knight to whom the honor of this victorie was truly due, commending him to the heauens for his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable addresse and magnanimitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:23383:96"/>Faine would she haue vnderstood the whole processe of his historie, and knowing no better mean, tooke to her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side her Embassador of the day before, whom she setteth thus aworke: vnspeakeable s√©emeth to me the generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this strange gentleman, who knew full well how to put in effect the resolution, whereof he sent me word yesternight by you, for which you must n√©edes goe thanke him from me, and also for the great trauel and pain which he hath sustained, to come for mysake thus far: moreouer as he hath in ample sort shewed me his force and prowesse in armes, tell him that I desire no lesse to s√©e his person being disarmed: Wherein to satisfie me, (if he will be this euening at the banket with my brother who is new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly espoused) he shall doe me this pleasure<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> which I wil not faile to account in the number of the kindest which I may receiue from him.</p>
               <p>The yong man went to dispatch this message. In the meane time while they did couer in the great chamber, al their talke was of nothing else but of the great prowesse of the knight who had won the Tourney, and that which drew the people into more admiration was that no bodie knew him, not <hi>Ripolo</hi> himselfe, who would very faine haue knowne the certaintie what he might be, but none could giue him any certaine newes. At the last <hi>Leifidaes</hi> page being come to <hi>Marcomyrs</hi> tent, deliuered him his message in wise manner, whereof the knight was merue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous well apaid, and returned him this answer. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I pray you certifie your mistresse from me, that I would not for any thing disobey her commaundement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no other thing in the world forced me to come so far from mine owne countrie, but an extreame desire I had to present vnto her my humble seruice, reputing my selfe most happie if she will but employ me in any thing which may be pleasurable vnto her. To goe sup with the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, it s√©emeth to me a thing a little repugnant to the small acquaintaunce which I haue as yet with him, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:23383:96"/>
with those of his companie: neuertheles I thinke verily to be there soone after supper, to the end mine eies may take their full repast at the obiect of the celestiall visage and comely grace of your mistresse, bes√©eching you in all deare affection, that you doe not make knowne to any who I am. And if peraduenture I may speake a little in secret with her, I shall tell her thinges which shall make her liue in ioifull content all the rest of her life. Wherein if you will be a third agent, loiall, and fauorable, to b√©e a meane of her good and your owne, I will return you such recompence that you shall call a hundred and a hundred times happy the hower, wherein through appointment of the destinies you met me by the way: for albeit you s√©e me now alone, and in this simple equippage of a knight errant, I possesse neuertheles great wealth, rich prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and great state. Sir, answered the messenger, I will employ willingly my person, to doe you all the seruice I may deuise in things which shal not empaire mine honor, nor that of my mistresse: and I will take beside very good order that you shall not be knowne of any but of hir who desireth extreamely to come to that point. Then <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr</hi> disarmed himselfe, and cast a Turkish gowne about him, carying vnder it his sword only, &amp; came along with the yong man into the great chamber wher the feast was kept: there standing in a corner, where he might s√©e and be s√©ene of <hi>Leifida,</hi> began to eie her with none other then a demure, smiling, and fained looke, to the end thereby to worke a cautelous meane to deliuer thence ere long the king of Thessalie.</p>
               <p>And whilst he plaied his counterfeit pageant very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly, the page went vnto <hi>Leifida</hi> his mistresse, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her softly in her eare: S√©e yonder madam the knight vanquisher of the Tourney, who praieth you in all deare loue, you will not disclose him to any of this countrie, whether he directed his voiage, onely to s√©e if your beauty and excellent graces did second your renowne which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sounded
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:23383:97"/>
into his eares, euen into his owne countries, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping if it be so, (for he hath alreadie opened to me the most secret gate of his heart) so to employ himselfe in matters of all difficultie to come by your acquaintance, that you shall haue none other occasion but to loue him, at the least to thinke your selfe much beholding to him for the trauell you your selfe shall s√©e him take for the same effect. The rest that h√©e told mee, I will recount it you at leasure in a place that may s√©eme fit to make vnto you so long a discourse.</p>
               <p>The Damsell who was sage and well aduised, left off at that time to conferre any longer with her new secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, fearing least the assistants might misd√©eme the loue which had alreadie too lightly ouercome her: but being not able to dissemble it long time, she cast her eies vppon <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> who imagined still his plot how he might bring his matter about. And she perceiuing him so pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue, interpreted this Saturnine stilnes to her good, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it proc√©eded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rom the rauishment that her beauty &amp; graces might haue driuen him into, according to the news which her messenger had brought her before. Ouer and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, iudging in him more comelinesse, forme and sw√©et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of phisiognomie, then in any other whom she knew, she was so enamoured in the very place with his enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing looke, that for the quenching of this flame, she desired then no greater thing, then to speake vnto him to know who he was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcomyr</hi> neuer departed from the place, till euery bodie almost was retired, and his long tarying there s√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not to be in vaine, assuring himselfe it would returne some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In fine, when she saw them depart, afterward she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:23383:97"/>
by and by into her chamber, who calling aside to her the messenger of her loue, she began thus: Ah page, most true are the words thou didst tell me of the knights beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whose comely gesture and s√©emely grauitie (if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not my selfe too much) with his prowes and valor in armes, make me d√©eme him the flower of the best accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished gentlemen that I euer yet beheld: Madame, said the young counsellor, if you will s√©e many perfections in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused into one bodie, I bes√©ech you speake vnto him as soon as you may, and let not slip out of your hands the happie and inestimable good which the destinies haue sent you hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fatally: wherein his eloquent and fluent tongue shall witnes sufficiently the rest of his vertues, whereof you shall find your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>elfe so well satisfied, as he may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that thing at your hand, which you can well denie him. How can I speake vnto him, quoth <hi>Leifida</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out incurring blame, and wronging mine honor which I haue hitherto carefully preserued, if it be not by your meane in some secret place, whether he may be brought, to take away all suspition from people, who are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies so prompt and readie to make the very innocents examples of their mallice? I will tell you quoth the yong man: you remember that my lord your father praied you the other day to returne to him as sp√©edily as you might possiblie: that will serue you in st√©ed of a good occasion to take your honest leaue of this companie, and if you will depart too morrow in the late of the day, you shall goe to bed to my mothers house, whether I will goe before you with the knights, to entreat her to say: they be her two ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews who come thether oftentimes to visit her. So may you at your discretion deuise and parly together. You say well replied <hi>Leifida,</hi> neuertheles you must looke you be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry discr√©et herein, least our deuise be discouered.</p>
               <p>This plot being taken and concluded vpon for good, the yong man went the morrow morning to be with <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr</hi> at his vprising, and hauing made him a glad ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> with
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:23383:98"/>
this newes, they mounted incontinent on horsebacke to get betimes to his mothers house, being seated in a verie pleasant place, iust in the halfe way betw√©ene Tubanta and the castell of Albase, n√©ere which streamed a fresh ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, whose bankes were planted with many goodly tr√©es, whereof al that countrie therabout was abundant, which appertained to the father of <hi>Leifida</hi> who was lord therof: when the good gentlewoman saw the two cousins she was greatly abashed, but her son had aduertised quickly how she was to behaue her selfe in that businesse, and well might she call such knights her nephewes, b√©eing that she was a stranger, and of a country farre distant from this place.</p>
               <p>The mother hauing had her sons instruction, how to gouerne her selfe herein, said only this one word: God grant this busines come to a good end. Doubt you not thereof mother, quoth the guide, but it will succ√©ed euen as you and we would wish, for this gentleman is one of the honest and best gouerned knights that I euer saw in my life, <hi>Marcomyr</hi> and <hi>Ozalias</hi> liked maruellous well the situation of this place, where they tarried alone with the good gentlewoman of the house, for that the messenger was gone backe to his mistresse, who made such diligence to depart that the new maried couple could not get her to stay a day nor an hower longer, for she thought the time so long before she was with him, for whom her heart felt so extreame passion, that by no mean he could be remoued out of her fantasie: Therefore taking her congie of al the companie, she would take along with her but foure of her Damsels and two of her fathers squiers. And she tooke the time of the day so iust, that she came about sunsetting to the place appointed, from whence her pages mother (who had made good prouision of all things she thought might s√©eme necessarie against her comming) went to meet her, with shew of maruellous gladnes: the entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her with no lesse ioy and welcome then she would
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:23383:98"/>
haue done her owne daughter, because that in her infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie she suckled her alwaies with her breast: and after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny welcomming and entertainments, <hi>Leifida</hi> demaunded her who might these two knights be, who had saluted her so graciously. They are quoth she, two of my nephewes, who come oftentimes to visit me, to know if I n√©ed any thing that they may doe for me, and likewise to present their seruice to my lord your father, if he may please to employ them.</p>
               <p>They are very welcome quoth the Damsell, and for my part I thanke them with all my heart for the good wil they beare to my lord and father: by means whereof and of the n√©ere affinitie betw√©ene them and you, I shall loue them no lesse, then mine owne proper brethren and kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Then <hi>Marcomyr</hi> bowing himself towards her with a lowly reuerence, thanked her courteously for the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable offer she made him, and so entring into further talke <hi>Leifida</hi> could not hold her eies off him, his s√©emely counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, good grace, and naturall beautie did rauish her so much, that from thence forward the liuely portraiture of his face was so far imprinted in her thoughts, that she did inherite nothing else thereby but an excessiue loue, which by this occasion did increase daily more and more in her.</p>
               <p>Whilest they were in treatie of their amours, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman commaunded to spread the table amidst a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant tuft of tr√©es, which was hard by the castle, wher <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fida</hi> did eat very little, by reason of the soueraigne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure which she toke indeuising with the knight: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards s√©eing they were both by themselues alone (because <hi>Ozalias</hi> and their hostesse were walked together abroad, and the rest went to supper presently after) the Damsell bespake him in this manner: Sir knight, I maruell very much at one thing in my selfe, that I being neuer moued for the loue of many braue gentlemen, who haue hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore oft times offered me their seruice, I f√©ele now for you (whom I haue s√©en but these two daies) my hart so woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

These words did he vtter with a maruellous grace because of the ioy and gladnes which had seised his heart, s√©eing the cariage of his busines come to so good passe as he could desire: and the damsel on the other side she found her selfe so much rauished with his loue, that she could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer glut her eies in surueying his beauty, and lesse for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake his companie, so that constrained at last to go to bed, could not sl√©epe of all the night but a little, all sl√©epe being driuen away by plurality of amorous discourses swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in her fansie, which had before gotten so much the vpper hand of her spirit, that incontinent they put away all other imaginations from her. With the rigour of this scourge did <hi>Leifida</hi> f√©ele her selfe most gr√©euously plagued: a far diuerse torment to that of <hi>Marcomyr</hi> who sought but by his dissimulation to worke in short time the recouerie of the good king of Thessalie: so that he past almost all that night in conferring with <hi>Ozalias</hi> about his sleights and stratagems which he was to worke for that effect: Praying him of all deare loue (being entred once into the castle) to shew himselfe hardy and valerous, putting all those who came before him to the edge of the sword, so soon as euer he should heare him giue the word of assault.</p>
               <p>The morrow morning being come, <hi>Leifida</hi> attired her selfe very richly, and before she did depart, tooke her walke thorow the delectable enclosures of her lodging, with the two knights alarmed, except their helmets, who praied her agood to take them both with her to Albase: to the end they might haue better and more honest mean to present themselues before the captaine of the castell, to whom they desired so extreamly to doe seruice. <hi>Leifida</hi> thanked them very gratiously, and said her father should be right glad of their comming: then mounting alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Approching the gates, the Damsell alighted from her hackney and the knights tooke her quickly by the hand, whom the garders suffered to enter, without making any reckoning nor enquiring otherwise of their estate, s√©eing them so well acquainted with <hi>Leifida,</hi> whom the lieutenant loued so dearely, that whatsoeuer she commanded or did, might not in any wise be gainsaid. Presently were the draw-bridges pulled vp, the gates well barred as they were wont, and the princes were caried into the hall, where <hi>Marcomyr</hi> vewed euery place exactly, and thinking euery hower a thousand years before he were at the skirmish in so sure a place, thanked God who had so well and prosperously conducted him thether.</p>

               <p>For all that his purpose was otherwise, because the more his daughter commended them, the more angry was he to see them within the castle, their very presence striking into him a feare and suspition: neuertheles to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble it, and not to let them perceiue therof, he proc√©eded thus with a pleasant countenance: daughter goe you in to salute your mother, &amp; in the meane time these knights well disarme them. This he spake, meaning to cause their armes to be lockt vp, and kept safe from them till they were out of the castell. But <hi>Marcomyr</hi> who heard those sp√©eches, doubting some such euent, cared not much to talke with him any further, but went strait away with the page of <hi>Leifida,</hi> who brought him vp into a very faire chamber, where in st√©ed of disarming themselues, they caused their squiers who carried their armes alwaies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them to lace their helmets quickly, then betaking

them to their shields with vnconquerable courage, they salied out hauing their naked swords ready drawn in their hands. Which the yong man s√©eing, (was more amased then if at the same instant he had lost his forme by some new metamorphosis) began to crie out in strange maner: O detestable and vile act of disloialtie, running downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to aduertise the gard, wherein he was soone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented: for <hi>Marcomyr</hi> knowing he might not delay his enterprise any longer, made sp√©edily down into the court, where he saw the captain blaming and rebuking the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for letting him in, who made their excuse vpon <hi>Leifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> that brought him in with her.

This constrained the knight (who would not haue stroke him otherwise, for the loue of his daughter) to strike againe, so that he gaue the old man such an ataint with a blow returned to his head that he cleft his skull downe to his iawes, giuing the like entertainment to thr√©e or foure other knights who let driue at him, thinking to massacker him quickly: but in a small space he made so cruell a slaughter of al those which came to encounter him, that the most hardie and valiant remained in the place either dead or dangerously woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And if peraduenture any coward made to the gate,

thinking to get out that waies to saue himselfe by flight, he fell into <hi>Ozalias</hi> hands, who shewed them but small courtesie: so that in this skirmish there remained not one man of the castle aliue, except the page which was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the ship that brought the two cousins into this good hauen: who ran imediatly to his mistres <hi>Leifida</hi> telling her thus.

When the Damsell and her mother heard these piteous tidings, they ranne forth almost out of their wits not knowing what to do, &amp; s√©eing this horrible discomfiture, they bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to wring their hands and poure forth the most pitifull complaints that euer any liuing person heard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leifida</hi> who accused her selfe of all this blame, fell downe halfe dead vpon her fathers corpes, vttering a sp√©ech in this sence: Alas deare father, pardon me who am the only cause of your death, which s√©eing I haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced innocently thorow the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How long wilt thou linger before thou send my woefull soule out of this languishing passion which it endureth in this my dying bodie? Tell me Barbarian, what moued th√©e to render this sorrowfull recompence for the extreame loue I bare th√©e, now conuerted into all deadly hatred, and more then mortall malice? How durst thou deceiue a poore maiden thus trecherously, considering the great familiarity into which I so soone admitted th√©e at the first sight? Ha dissembler, that hast thus surprised me through the false apparence of thy faire and sugred words, saying thou wert a king, a prince, a great siegnior, I thinke it wel, but of th√©eues and murderers, who camst hether but to pillage the treasure in this place. O foolish &amp; more then miserable girle, to credit so lightly thy cogging and deceitfull persuasion: whose issue is but too tragicall and full of calamity. Surely if all those who knew me e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue reputed me a sage and an obedient daughter, now they shall from henceforth account me for the most disloiall and wickeddest maiden that liues, hauing thus wrought the death of mine owne father. And although it be against my will, shall I for that cease to exclaim of the inconstancie of fortune, which by the only report of, I know not what cloked and friuolous ostentation, hath so easily chaunged my heart: What will you my lord the great Turke say, when you shall vnderstand the tidings of this massaker, which hath ben so cautelously wrought to steale hence your treasor? Alas why doe I not call to mind the aduersitie and dommages that your brother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the Emperor of Constantinople, when h√©e tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled the world as a knight errant, I should f√©ele no more the perplexitie which this too suddaine confidence that I reposed in this stranger driues me into: but what!

               <p>This was the tragicomicall act that <hi>Marcomyr</hi> began to play at Prissa &amp; continued at Albase, where the Casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and his gards of the castle, finished miserablie their liues.

Therefore most willingly preparing himselfe to the sacrifice, he cried out alowd: Red√©emer of humane nature, I commend vnto th√©e the poore soule which must presently passe out of his vile prison, vouchsafe then pittiful father to accept the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels and miseries that I haue so long time patiently suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for pennance of my sins: and s√©eing he hath knowne my bodie vnworthie of his protection in this world, b√©e to him a mediatour for my soule in his celestiall kingdome, to the end his Iudgement may not banish it, from the place of eternall felicitie, which he hath promised to the blessed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcomyr</hi> being stricken dumbe at this lamentable sp√©ech, <hi>Ozalias</hi> began to speake thus vnto the king: let not your maiestie feare that we are come to wrong you, but to deliuer you out of this sufferance, and to bring you to Constantinople, where you shall find your Qu√©ene with <hi>Celestina</hi> your onely daughter (by whose meane you are presently set at libertie) who attendeth there for you in all deuotion.

               <p>So that the Qu√©ene who scantly knew the king her husband (so much did his long grisely haire, and his beard grown out of fashion mishape him) m√©eting him at aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thus bespake him: fair lord are you that king of Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salie for whom this wofull heart of mine hath endured so much sorrow? I bes√©ech you tell me quickly and hold not her long in suspence, who now knoweth you not, being so much changed as you are. Madame answered the king, I maruell not if you misknow me now, considering the lapse of time that your eies haue discontinued their office vpon me, the which surely the integrity of loue hath made it s√©eme far longer to vs both, albeit the accustomable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolution of yeares doth neuer augment nor diminish his natural course one onely minut: notwithstanding I am the same king your husband who haue felt more passions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Great was the gladnesse of the king, seeing a damsell so beautiful and well nurtured being his daughter, whom he held long time in his arms before he could let her go, taking both of them such pleasure in this recognisance, and naturall homage of father and daughter, that with simple reiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherein me thinketh to veryfie the renowne that is daily spread abroad of you, you ought to take pittie at mine aduersitie, and rather to lament and be sorrie for it, then to glory and mocke as I s√©e you doe: considering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant fortune is so fickle and variable that she turneth her smiling and fauourable countenance at euery winke of an eie.</p>
               <p>This I say not to induce you to gratifie or honour m√©e the more in your court, because death were far more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to me then any life, such as I alreadie endure: wherefore I require you againe (if request I must n√©eds make to such an aduersarie) to aduise hereafter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue your reputation so, that I purchase no blame which may offend mine honour, and you shall doe much as well for my sorrowfull consolation, as for the increase of your owne praise. When she had vttered these sp√©eches, the princesse began to complaine in such strange maner, that the emperour himselfe did pittie her, and could not chuse but answer her thus: I vnderstand very well what you say, and I know better that feminine choller which now enrageth your spirit, making you transgresse the limits of good manners and modestie: not being ignoraunt how the puissance of princes is lesse then nothing, when God doth resist and stand against them: wherevpon we must make our full resolution, that we cannot doe any good act but according to his will, by the which I was carried as it pleased him into the Gransiegniors your vncles court, and I sweare and protest before him to whome all things are knowne (I will not otherwise be saued at the end of my daies) if I slue him, or euer thought to doe it, hauing then intoo too fresh memorie the honour which a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I receiued of him: this ind√©ed, I depriued him of the damsell which he detained by force, to put her againe into

And for that the sage and wise alwaies take in good part as well aduerse as prosperous fortune, I assure my selfe madame, you shall haue no more cause to be sorie hereafter, when you shall vnderstand you were conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the most courteous and braue knight who liues at this day vnder the stars, <hi>Marcomyr</hi> by name, the very same who vanquished in Hellespont king <hi>Ocurites</hi> your husband.

O Fortune how dooest thou in all things shew thy selfe too much mine enemie, bringing me into such perplexity that I cannot giue my self the mortal attaint, to send my soule out of this gulfe of affliction, in which I f√©ele my selfe so d√©epely plunged, that I s√©e no better remedie to get out, then to launch my selfe cruelly vpon the dart of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable <hi>A tropos.</hi> Surely thou art so spightful against me that I can haue no hope by praiers to mooue thy mercie, but may say iustly, the heauen hath bene far better aspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted towards me then thou prosperous or fauourable: and so it is better I resolue to indure patiently my mishaps, s√©eing all things crosse me so, that I cannot in them find the least sparke of fauour.</p>

There made he vnto him the whole discourse of the old beldame, who appeared to him sitting vpon the foot of a stone pillar, in the cloisters of his palace, and what she told him, blaming him for the idle and delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life he led. K√©eping silent neuerthelesse how she certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him to be his sonne, because he reserued that to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest it vnto him last of all other matters, if he did not sollicite him more instantly.

to become a Christian, and to receiue the holy sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of baptisme.

And this act hath not so much displeased God, but he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be procreated thereby a deuout creature of his, who euidently knoweth the Predestination, vnto which euer since his nauitie he submitted it. Which is my selfe your most humble son and obedient seruant: to whom it s√©emeth impossible this extream desire, should not giue you some presumption of the matter, when you shall haue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine assurance, by the remembrance which may now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh your memorie of that which happened betw√©ene you both.

Surely far more then any humane tongue is able to expresse: for the vnspeakeable ioy wherewith I f√©ele my heart ouercome, surpasseth the capacitie of the most eloquent and learned clarke who euer for this effect might put pen to paper.

So great was the ease and pleasure of those who vnderstood this good newes, that all the night they could not sl√©epe nor take any rest, for that some made bonefires, others sounded trumpets, and many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments for ioy and gladnes, in briefe he did not thinke himselfe the son of a good mother who did not welcome <hi>Marcomyr</hi> as the Emperors sonne: or who did not shew some signe of reioicing at that vnexpected parentage: but all this was nothing in respect of that which the Emperor did on the morrow morning, who sent one of the richest and most sumptuous presents to <hi>Marcomyr</hi> and <hi>Ozalias,</hi> that euery one might easily discerne common loue from that which is naturall: wherein <hi>Ozalias</hi> shewed himselfe not too much pleased, for no other cause but to s√©e <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr</hi> thorowly resolued to become a Christian, presaging alreadie in his heart what would befall the Qu√©ene his aunt, when she should be aduertised of that miserie: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles <hi>Marcomyr</hi> comforted him in the most amiable sort he might, assuring him to crowne him king of Tarsus, where he might lead a ioifull life with his faire <hi>Marenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da:</hi> which assuaged his miscontented mind a little.</p>
               <p>And if the Emperor did giue rich presents vnto <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr,</hi> the Empresse sent no lesse to <hi>Celestina,</hi> some whereof were presently bestowed vpon her person, which was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to be adorned to goe to the ceremonie of the baptisme of hir loue <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> who should be affianced to hir present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after: for this occasion did all the Barons and knights of the court mount on horsebacke, who did much more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> then before when they knew not his descent.

               <p>Gratious lord replied <hi>Arnedes,</hi> I bes√©ech you in all humility not to vse these sp√©eches vnto me, for I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not my selfe worthie thereof, and lesse of the honor which I haue receiued in your countries, assuredly farre surmounting that little which I know I haue merited: assuring you my spirit had neuer taken rest, before I had come to see the magnificence of your court, to doe you my best seruice according to my power which is but small. Small ind√©ed in respect of the good will which surpasseth that of the best affectionate seruants which you haue: in
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:23383:124"/>
whose number, I bes√©ech you to account me the very first as him who by deuotion and sinceritie of heart none li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing can goe before in this behalfe: Wherein I find my selfe greatly disfauored of the heauen, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or none occasion hath as yet ben offered to shew it you in that sort as<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> I haue liuely imprinted it in my thoughts. It sufficeth then quoth the Emperor againe, of that which you haue done alreadie: being proofe of a truth very sufficient to raise you to this reputation of one of the best and most perfect knights of this our age: and as for me, if I be not shent for this fauor, considering the amitie I beare you, I shall be alwaies the formost in this opinion, wherein I do not thinke my selfe much ouers√©ene, as I should repute my self very happy to purchase you for my son in law, when you would giue therevnto your consent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arnedes</hi> who saw the passage opened, by which he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to conduct his soule into rest, and by none other but by him who had the true key thereof, felt himselfe almost ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished with ioy, whentaking the Emperor by the hand to kisse it in signe of thanks, went on thus: wel may I now vaunt my selfe to attaine the perfect fruition of al worldly blisse, s√©eing I am by you offered so honorable alliance, for which I cannot returne you so many thankes (to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite my self therby of the obligation wherin I am yours bounden) but I shall find my selfe still more and more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to you in a new bond which shall bind me in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this kindnes. Neuertheles if the extreame affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I haue to continue for euer your obedient seruant and humble sonne (if it s√©eme good vnto you) may by any meane serue you in st√©ed of an earnest, I bes√©ech you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it such as I can present you, to the end hereafter you may vse me as your right hand and as your left, as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily as your two eies at the only thought of your spirit. For euen as the thunder crack following the lightening which goeth before it, striketh more suddainely then any thing els his blow where he hitteth, far more prompt shal

I be at the only coniectures which I shall gather of your desires, to satisfie you therin without attending to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded therevnto.</p>
               <p>The Emperor meruellous ioifull to heare him profer these honest speeches, knew very well with what arrow he was wounded, and that which moued him to come and seeke in his court the balme and perfect cure of his wound: therefore he caused him to sit downe by him, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated him many other matters, whereat the Emperour maruelled not a little, especially when he vnderstood the historie of his cousin <hi>Recindos.</hi> Of this was <hi>Melisla</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad, for sh√©e loued the Spanish Prince most ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>

On the morrow the Emperor caused all his pallace to be hanged round with cloth of gold, and all his most exquisit iewels and sumptuous riches to be set o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly sorth, to the end the French Embassadors might s√©e his magnificent pompe.
