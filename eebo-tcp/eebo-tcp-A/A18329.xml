            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>After manie cogitations which perplexed his mind not a little, he resolued in as secret maner as might be, to depart with one onely Squire to attend vpon his person, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to take his voyage directly into Macedon, there to make his first assay of Armes in the aduenture of <hi>Celestina</hi> the Faire, who was at that time enchaunted within a castell of

               <p>The Emperour who heard afterward ofhis secret depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was passing glad of this enterprise, and in presence of many knights began thus in his fauour: Now as God mee helpe, I haue an opinion, nay, a confident hope, <hi>Belcarin</hi> will be haue himselfe so valiantly in feates of armes, that all ye will be glad in heart to heare me make the discourse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

Soone after perceiued he the traine of this ladie, and for that he feared to be discouered by some of the companie, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his horse to be brought him, and mounted, he tooke againe into the way wherein he was going before, whereat <hi>Alde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> somewhat displeased, for she would verie faine haue knowne who he was, boorded him thus.</p>
               <p>Sir knight, stay here boldly at your ease, and forsake not this swéet and delectable place for our comming: for consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the great heate of the day, it is yet no time for you to trauell on your way. And if you go peraduenture to the tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which is held in Macedon, you may come thither in good time with the Duke my father, who shall bée verie glad of your companie, &amp; I much more, who met you here by chance first of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Belcarin</hi> humblie thanking her for this curtesie, made his excuse that he could not go into Macedon, because he had many other more vrgent affairs in another quarter, whether he did pretend his voiage, therefore once more he tooke leaue of her againe, and spurred his horse that way which séemed fittest for his purpose: onely to get himselfe as farre as hée could from this companie: and méeting a Squire who came after the traine and carriages, he demaunded of him, if hée knew not the Lord who rode before with so great a traine? the Squire answered him, it was the Duke of Pontus, who was going into Macedone to the feast which king <hi>Florendos</hi>

celebrated for the mariage of the infant <hi>Denise,</hi> and that he had in companie with him his daughter <hi>Alderine,</hi> to sée the iustes &amp; tournaments which they were there preparing.</p>

                  </gap>or he should haue time enough afterward to perform his voiage. Thus did <hi>Belcarin</hi> forsake the way towardes the Isle of Carderie to take that of Macedon, which was little more than thrée daies iourney from thence. On the third day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come néere the citie, he met with two knights armed, who went to this tourney, and after enterchange of salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, the two knights asked him if hee came not thither to iust.

Let vs go then togither in companie, if it please you, said they, because we are for the same effect departed from our countries. So they road on their waies talking of many matters toward Macedon, where being ariued, they found a large plain co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with tents of the nobilitie which were already come to sée the solemnitie.

               <p>Whereat the Duke <hi>Anemon,</hi> who saw his side put to the woorse, was in a great rage against them: and as hée perceiued all this to procéede from the comming in of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carin,</hi> he began presently to gather in towards him, and to salute him with a great blowe of his swoorde vppon his helmet, of whome by and by he receiued quicke paiment: for that <hi>Belcarin</hi> lifting himselfe vppon his Stirrops, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him a full blow so right on his Beauer, that he set him packing in a maze vnder his horse heeles. Then passing further, made way thorow the presse, and bore downe to the ground all that euer he met, in such manner that king <hi>Florendos,</hi> and the other Nobles who did accompanie him, were in a great woonder, and none could discrie, nor giue anie knowledge who hée should bée, except <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derine,</hi> who then sitting there hard by Quéene <hi>Denise,</hi> coulde not holde her tongue, but must prattle of him thus.</p>
               <p>Madame, how thinke you ofthe knight in the gréene ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour? What I thinke?

               <p>Madame, replied <hi>Alderine,</hi> I beléeue hee cannot be but a great personage, séeing that he kéepeth himselfe so close, and will not bee discouered of anie: Moreouer, shee tolde her, howe shée found him at the Fountaine bare headed, his Murrion lying by him.

Now I haue a great desire (quoth Quéene <hi>Denise</hi>) to know who he is, so that I thinke best to send a messenger to him for the same effect. Then (quoth <hi>Alderine</hi> interrupting her) Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, I pray you that the messenger may be one of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, who shall wait for him at the going out of the Tylt, to coniure him on your behalfe to declare his name: and if he desire not to be knowne, we will conceale it so secretly that no man shall knowe it by our meane.

                  <hi>Alderine</hi> then called one of her Pages, named <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> and instructed him what hée had to say to the Knight in the gréene armour, to whome shee sent him expreslie, with instant request, ioyned with a singular desire to knowe who he was. In the meane time, <hi>Belcarin</hi> did such admirable things in his Iustes, and with such his insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable dexteritie and martiall prowesse did so canuasse his aduersaries, that being no longer able to stand before him, they got away, and departed out of the lists, where he remained alone victorious. Then the two knightes with whom he soiourned, who had beene rather occupied all this while to beholde his prowesses, than to Iust and Tilt, béeing woonderfull glad ofthe honour he did them, in winning the honour of this day, set him in the middest betwéene them, and so tooke their way towardes their Tent: whither they were followed by the Page of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derine,</hi> who neuer lost sight of them, but finding a fit place for the purpose, tooke <hi>Belcarins</hi> Horse by the Bridle, and bowing downe with a low reuerence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thus: Faire Knight, may you please to heare two woordes of a message which I haue to doe vnto you:

               <p>My brother, answered <hi>Belcarin,</hi> it should be some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, nay impossible thing, if I did not vndertake it to finde pardon at so high a ladies hands as your mistres is: albeit if I haue made an offence towards her excellencie, it was onely through mine ignorance, who knew her not.

               <p>Then the page replied: Séeing that it is your pleasure to accomplish that which my ladie <hi>Alderine</hi> would entreat you, know she hath an extreame desire to know who you are, and wherfore you keepe your selfe so close &amp; secret: for considering your valour and chiualry, she esteemeth you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all others, of whom as yet she had euer any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: promising you also by the faith ofsuch a lady as shée is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Further you shall assure her from me, that I offer my selfe from henceforth to serue her as her most humble knight, hoping vnder the fauour of her famous name, to win so great reputation, that I and my posteritie shall for euer remaine her bounden seruaunts. And then when I haue done those thinges, whereby I may merite honour and commendation, I will come vnto her my selfe to make her the offer of my heart, which féeleth it selfe so much affectioned to obey her, that it shall not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing hereafter, which may not be to her liking and pleasure. So much she shall know in commanding me, for I haue so readie a will to employ my selfe in her seruice that notwithstanding the hazard of my life did depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doing it, I will not spare any of my best forces: Besée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching her moreouer not to disclose my name to any one for that I would at this present visit the king <hi>Florendos</hi> and the Quéene my grandfather and grandame.</p>
               <p>With this answere returned <hi>Gracian</hi> to his mistres, who staied for him in so great deuotion, that so soone as shée saw him come a farre of, she could not containe, but must néeds aske him what successe had followed the exploit of his ambassage.

               <p>Then helmets went on both sides to the ground, and these two companions many times embraced each other most louingly, when <hi>Tiraquel</hi> in this sort spake to <hi>Belcarin</hi>: In good faith sir, it cannot by any mean sink into my head, that your heart hath euer consented to commit such a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous act, as this damsell hath persuaded me to beléeue. Tell me, I pray you now, began <hi>Belcarin,</hi> what fellow is this? for another knight (whom I suppose I slue, or at the least sore wounded) hath already fought with me vpon that quarell: assuring you this damsell should be some bad wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, séeing she accuseth me thus wrongfully, and staineth mine honor with this disloialtie. She hath giuen me to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, quoth <hi>Tiraquel,</hi> how her father hauing greatly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured you in his castell, one night that you lodged there, and the morrow morning hauing sent thrée of his sonnes to accompanie you on your way, how you should slay two of them outright, leauing the third sore wounded. Ah, treacherous damsell, then quoth <hi>Belcarin,</hi> how manifest a lie doe I nowe heare? My companion, most true it is, that I slept one night in the Castell that she speaketh of, where I neuer saw man, but the Lord of the place, who was a verie honourable and courteous knight: of whom taking my leaue the morrow morning all alone, when I had scant gone little more then two miles, I founde at the side of a forrest, thrée knights all armed, who forced me to Iust against them, and my fortune was at the first
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:23383:20"/>
encounter to lay one on the ground with my launce: which the other perceiuing, ranne both with great violence vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, but I deliuered my selfe from them as well as I might. If they were the sonnes of the Lord of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell, that knowe not I, greatly it should displease mee if they were, for the honour and good entertainement I receyued at his handes. I beléeue assuredly as you say, then replied <hi>Tiraquel,</hi> and this damsell can not be but some shamelesse and badde woman, who hath deceyued mee with this lie: But shée maie thanke the great gladnesse which hath seased my spirites in seeing you, otherwise I should chastice her sharpelie, for her impudencie and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie malice.</p>
               <p>Shée, who heard all these spéeches, and saw peace esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished betwéene the two Knights, hauing the verie teares standing in her eies, begins to exclaime thus: Oh, most accursed and vnfortunate wretch, ah what collusion is this? Certes, this knight whom I brought hither, séemes to me as false and disloial as the other, of whom I séeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge: neuerthelesse, séeing he hath circumuented me, and ill performed his promise, if I die not speedily, I hope to make him repent it, and to see my selfe reuenged of them both. Hauing vttered these speeches, shee returned the same way she came, and the two knights retired into their Tents. There <hi>Tiraquel</hi> recounted to <hi>Belcarin,</hi> how the knight whom the Damsell caused first to fight against him, vpon this supposed treason, was <hi>Sergin,</hi> whom hee had also left in the Chirurgians hands: whereof <hi>Belcarin</hi> was grieuously displeased, much blaming and cursing the shamelesse woman, who had induced them both falselie to beléeue her. Then for his part he discoursed to <hi>Tiraquell,</hi> all that had happened to him in this aduenture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> also what determination hee had set downe against all those, who should come thither with like intention, for as much as he could not vndoe the inchantment himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:23383:21"/>By the faith of a Knight, quoth <hi>Tiraquel</hi> then, your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt séemeth to me farre greater and more difficult, than the execution of that of the Castell wherein the Ladie is prisoner, in the which I haue no minde to make assay, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it cannot by you bee brought to an end: but well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent will I be, to kéepe here in your good companie. So they dwelt there together, being most exquisitely serued of all that was necessarie for them, and taking all pleasure that they might best deuise, they did there passe time meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the daughters of <hi>Lipes,</hi> who came thither manie times to visite them: Albeit, <hi>Belcarin</hi> found that hee had some what to doe, for that it behoued him to make good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst so great a number of Knights, who came thither from all parts to proue themselues in the aduenture: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides against those whom the damsell conducted thither, to reuenge the death of her brethren. But this was a strange and admirable case, that all the long time that <hi>Belcarin</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourned there, neuer came any knight thither who could go beyond him in chiualrie and prowesse: so that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme, accompanied with a singular and most commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable praise, spread it selfe ouer all the kingdome of Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and moreouer in the empire of Gréece. During which painefull exercise that he continued without intermission, the delicious life which by their industrie they studied to prouide, was verie necessarie for him in that place, for that it did diminish much the sorrowe and trauaile that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured. Wherein wée will leaue him a little to recreate his spirites, to speake of the good Knight <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> sonne of the Emperour <hi>Cleodomyr,</hi> and of the Quéene of Tarsus.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Quéene of Tarsus caused with great care to be brought vp <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr</hi> her sonne, whom she had by the Emperour <hi>Cleodomyr</hi> at that time, when following the exercise of arms he arriued in the Cittie of Alfarin scituate in the kingdome of Pasme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as you haue read amply in his historie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This child was of so good a nature, that the quéen and all those of the kingdome held themselues very well pleased, because the more he grew in corpulence, so much the more he shewed himselfe vertuous, and to descend of roiall and illustrious bloud: so that to put him out of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire euer to goe sée his father, (fearing he would haue a will to make himselfe a Christian) they would neuer tell him of whom he was engendred. But to the end he should bée brought vp and well instructed, as did the Heroical gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of so high and great a prince require, the quéen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the charge and gouernement of him to a brother of the defunct king of Tarsus her husband, a knight both very valiant and wise: of whom he was so vertuously instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in litterature, that his naturall enclination his fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life, and good manners did appeare euery day more then other most commendable, whereby he was excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly made of, and reuerenced by his friends, especially because they saw a wise discretion in him, to prefer mercie before rigour: for he tooke great pleasure to doe any fauor
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:23383:22"/>
or charitable act to those who did require him. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les if he appeared courteous and louing towards the good, so contrariwise he shewed himselfe bitter and seuere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the wicked, so that by reason of his meruellous wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and naturall care he had in good things, from his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry infancy and tender age, he would vnderstand the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the affairs of the kingdome: wherin, within a little while (his spirit being maruellous apt to be taught, &amp; capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all good things) he ordred himself so wel, &amp; was so good a politician in his gouernment, that the quéen began to lay vpon him the gouernment of the whole estate. If he enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched himselfe by little and little in the perfection of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, there wanted not in him the blossome of a liuely beautie of his bodie: wherein were all comely graces so excellent well bestowed in euery part, with the which he could so well behaue himselfe with all temperance and modesty towards al braue knights, who hearing his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses published thorow al the marches of Tarsus bordering round about, came of their owne accord to offer him their seruice.</p>
               <p>So that the court was quickly ful, when on a day before he was armed knight (for in truth beside the roiall nature which he brought with him from his mothers wombe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the aspect and celestiall influence of his constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation he was born and naturally enclined to armes) there came to sit down vpon a bench in a walking place within a base court of his pallace, an old wrinckled and decrepit woman, so ragged and torne that she shewed her bare illfauoured flesh in many places: trembling so sore, that it séemed her soul would strait depart out of her body. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at those who went vp &amp; down there within began to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet had some compassion on the poore wretch, and as <hi>Marcomyr</hi> came forth of his chamber, he saw her in this miserable estate, and beheld her a good while, saying not a worde, and without any spéech went presently from the place to sit downe to dinner. Afterward purposing to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:23383:22"/>
some where to disport himselfe, he found her sitting in the same place where hée saw her before: by reason whereof, hée begins to say to one of his cosins, named <hi>Ozalias,</hi> sonne of his ouncle and gouernour: Cannot wée know who is that good old woman which you sée lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpon that stone seate there. Then <hi>Ozalias,</hi> to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the matter truely, came néere this old beldame to demaund her who shée was, and whether she would haue any thing that was within the house. But the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent old trot, answering not a word, looked vpon him with a squay looke, and then turned her backe to him: whereat <hi>Ozalias</hi> disdaining, kickt her so good a thumpe with his foot, that hée made her fall from her seate to the ground.</p>
               <p>At this goodly spectacle, <hi>Marcomyr</hi> began to laugh a good, and all the Barons and Nobles with him, but their laughter turned into a suddaine admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for so soone as this ould mother was risen vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, shée séemed so great and ougly, that shée made them all wonder who had beheld her so little before. Then shée turned her selfe all in a rage towards the Prince, taking him vp sharply thus:</p>
               <p>Ha <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> sure thou wilt neuer resemble the Emperour of Constantinople thy father, who is as méeld and affable to the poorest and least, as to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test lords, and other persons of higher qualitie! What a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile hast thou gotten to reioice at the iniurie which I haue receiued of thy gentleman? I pray the great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narque <hi>Cupido</hi> (quoth she, holding vp her hands to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen) that hée wound thy heart cruelly with the loue of faire <hi>Celestina,</hi> and suffer thée neuer to leaue thinking on her, that thou maiest leaue off this daintie and peaceable life which thou now leadest, to chaunge it for that wherein men endure most paines and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels. So did a good while since thy father for the Princesse <hi>Polinard,</hi> whom he loued so perfectly, that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:23383:23"/>
with all his best force and dexterity of bodie he attempted to win the roialtie that fortune prepareth for her dearest fauourits, vpon the which he is now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eated, enioying a far greater felicity then any other Prince dwelling vnder our hemispheare. Forsake then these court delights in which thy mother séeketh to drowne thée, begin to manage armes a little, which shall eternize thy name, and make the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which thou shalt purchase immortall: for this is thy great shame (being sonne to so rare and inuincible a knight) not to aspire by this mean to imitate him and trace in his labourious steps. Then, when I shall behold thée vp to the eares in thine amourous passions, languishing and tormenting thy selfe out of measure, I will thinke my selfe reuenged of the wrong and dishonor that thou hast suffered me to sustaine in thy presence.</p>
               <p>The old woman had no sooner ended these spéeches to <hi>Marcomyr</hi> (whom from that time forward, shée dubbed knight of the order of <hi>Cupid,</hi> who is to carrie for ensigne <hi>A wounded heart pierced with an arrow</hi>) she vanished out of sight incontinent, whereat they were all sore affea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red which beheld her: euen the Prince himselfe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for a while after amazed as though he had ben in a traunce: and thinking vpon that which the old beldame had said to him, he felt his heart so troubled and fiered for the loue of her whom as yet he knew not, that he was fame to burst forth into these complaints: Alas, who may that lady be, with whose loue by the only rebuke of this old woman I feele my self already so rauished? Surely, if her spéeches be not coloured, or too far from any truth, that I am the Emperour of Constantinoples sonne, it behoueth me to act some thinges by which I may be iudged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble him.</p>
               <p>Meane time his spirit was thus occupied in this diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of thoughts, and that none durst be so hardie as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe him, <hi>Ozalias</hi> went to the quéens chamber, where he recounted to her all this whole discourse, whereat she was
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:23383:23"/>
greatly displeased: and immediatly came into the presence for thither they said her sonne had withdrawne himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: who perceiuing his mother comming towards him, came before her with a very sad countenance, and greatly perplexed, as he was. She tooke him then by the hand, and causing him to sit downe by her, thus she beginneth: Son, I know not what sollies, it séemeth, this old doting wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath now put into your head, cease I pray you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue them, and I will tell you the verie truth.</p>
               <p>Madam, answered <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> I am sure you will not hide it from mee in anie thing, notwithstanding, I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell much you haue hitherto concealed from me the degrée of my genealogie: for the Emperour <hi>Cleodomyr,</hi> being so braue and worthie a knight as he is accounted of through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, I could haue had none occasion of disdain to be his sonne, and you lesse to haue told it me. Therefore I pray you most humbly, resolue me this doubt and scruple which I haue in my minde: to the end if it be so, I may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my best endeuours to make the bud issued from so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vertuous a braunch, blossom forth and flourish the better. And feare you not for his sake, I should euer forsake you, for it were impossible for me to leaue the law, after which I haue so long time liued, for any strange law what so euer it might be.</p>
               <p>Alas, my sonne, quoth the Quéene, interrupting him, I pray the gods to inspire you, and to direct so well your desseigns, that you fully accomplish what you promise me: for the onelie feare I haue to loose you, hath made me kéepe close til this present houre, that which you desire so much to know: But séeing your eares haue béene tickled with that which I can no longer dissemble, assure your selfe, my sonne, what the old Beldame tolde you is most true. Then recounted she to him the whole storie: how shee, to haue issue of some excellent and worthie knight (imitating <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestria</hi> Quéene of the Amazonians, who for like occasions did acquaint hir selfe with the valiant king <hi>Alexander</hi>) did
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:23383:24"/>
by the counsel of a wise Magitian, amourously deceiue the emperor <hi>Cleodomyr:</hi> in conclusion shee besought him not to leaue her whilest she liued: for that being depriued and banished from his presence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> could not liue one houre.</p>
               <p>Great matters are these which you tell me, quoth the yong prince, the Emperor then knoweth not that he hath had any children by you? No surely, replied the Quéene, nor would I he should for any thing in the world. That can not be long so, quoth <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> for néeds must I one day goe to sée him: but beléeue me, Madam, I shall not be long away, for that I haue fully determined neuer to leaue you, nor to abandon by my will the kingdome, that God hath giuen me to gouerne. Thus communed together of many things the mother and the son, who from thence forwarde shewed himselfe to his vassals verie pleasant, and well pleased in mind: so that resoluing spéedily to bée knighted, he caused to be made for himselfe an armour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect red, and another white for <hi>Ozalias,</hi> whom he loued as his brother. And after they had watched in the chappell, they had both the sword girded to them, and the long spur put on by the father of <hi>Ozalias,</hi> who was one of the best knights in all those countries. Hauing then both of them receiued of him the accollado, order was giuen for the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mnising of a great feast for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same effect. During which feast, <hi>Marcomyr</hi> bestowed many rich presents vpon diuers. But hee could neuer forget <hi>Celestina,</hi> nor put out of his mind the words of the old beldame, for that he had them so liuely imprinted therein, that they tormented him more than might do any mortall martirdome. Wherfore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to passe into Gréece, to the end to visit the Emperor his father, and to learne some newes of this ladie, for well déemed hee, not without cause, had the enchauntresse vsed such vile spéeches to him: so that one day after dinner fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Quéene his mother at conuenient leisure, and in a place fit for the purpose: in very modest sort hee kissed her cheeke. And as many discourses had passed betwéene them,

                  <hi>Marcomyr</hi> besought her humbly, she would grant him one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I would madame, quoth he then, you take no displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, if I make shortly a voyage to Constantinople, to sée the emperor my father, &amp; the braue knights of his court: for I féel dayly augment in me the desire, which euer since you assured me to be his son, commeth euery houre into mine imagination: but I promise you by the inuiolable &amp; sincere faith which the child aboue all things oweth the mother, to returne with as great speed, as shall be possible.</p>
               <p>Alas, my sonne, cried out the Queene, and sighed, your wordes haue so farre wounded and pierced my heart, that I behold plainlie <hi>Atropos</hi> alreadie cutting off the thread of my sorrowful life: yet if to auoid the extremitie into which I see my selfe now reduced, I feared alwaies to manifest to you my ruine, seeing I cannot now preuent it, nor with honestie denie, that whereunto I haue so rashlie consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is good reason I suffer patiently my misfortune.

he found any knight that did resist or would not obey his will, he ouercame them by force of armes, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to thrust them into a stinking and darke prison.</p>
               <p>The marchants and others traffaking by sea, spoiled of all they caried, he caused them cruelly to be put to death: so that all who had notise of this tyrannie, did shun this road as a daungerous quicksand or gulf. In this Isle was there moreouer a greater aduenture: for in the time of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles there was a rich priest, a great Magitian, and a sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher out of secret things, high priest of the sanctuarie of the Temple, and beside chief of the Economicall and politicall gouernment of this prouince: who hauing one very faire daughter, chast and adorned with all vertues requisit in a virgin, did consecrat her to the seruice of the Oracle. It fell out the duke of Fera, a verie comly and gallant yong gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, fell in loue with her, onely by report hee heard of her: for he had manie times heard tell, that in beautie and comelinesse shee did excell the most properest of all those parts: therfore did he send to the prelate to demand her for his wife, but many times as he sent, he had his labor for his trauell, because her father would neuer be farre from her.</p>
               <p>And euen as the messenger which is sent twice or thrice into one place to obtaine something of a man, would saine haue, séeketh by all meanes possible to satisfie his desire who requesteth it, rather to auoide the paine and shame to be alwaies talking about the matter, then for any zeale &amp; good deuotion which he hath towards him: euen so fell it out with the bearer of this embassage: being vexed to goe and come so often without doing any good, did bring at last to passe, that he talked one day with the maiden, whom hée gaue so swéete a lesson, and set such a glosse vpon his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to make a priuie marriage, that shée was rauished in loue of the Duke, and promised him, if his master would come to take her away secretly from her fathers house, she would go willingly with him.</p>

to the isle, where being arriued, he aduertised the Damsell, who sent him word backe he should goe stay for her in a certaine place néere her fathers pallace, where she would not misse to méet him, so soone as his people should be asléepe. But the preist who by meanes of his Magicke had preuented all these practises, knowing the place where the lord of Fera attended for his daughter, caused from the mountaine to descend two fierce lions enchaunted: These cruell beasts rushing in with a hideous roaring vpon the miserable Duke (who by no meane knew how to preuent such ambuskadoes) began to fawne on him in pittifull manner: meane while this young prince losing at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant all power to defend himselfe against the rage and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of these infernall beastes, was quickly torne in pieces. Which his Squier beholding (too pittifull and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a spectacle) who was come alone to accompanie him, exclaimed with such a fearefull crie, as the Damsell who had her eares most attentiue to listen, heard it easely, so also did some other of the house, who running forth with burning torches to know what was the matter, found the Duke alreadie dead: Whereof the maiden being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised, she ran out of the pallace as a body possessed with a spirit or mad, to goe to finish vp the sacrifice. So vnsuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable was the griefe and sorrow she had to sée her future spouse lie so cruelly massacred, that taking his very sword, set the pommell against the ground and the point right vnder her breast: then cast her selfe with a great stresse of bodie vpon it, thinking to pierce right vpon her heart, to which she would not giue one onely moment of life after the death of her louer: For all that she was frustrate of her attempt, for the sword passing thorow the right side, she fell vpon the dead bodie, still full of life, where making ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny complaints with sighes and sobs as fast as one could follow another, she wrot with her owne bloud vpon a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which she found in her bosome, twelue lamentable verses in forme of an Epitaph.

So vehement was the anguish which seased his sorrowfull soule, that he remained long time without speaking worde, as a man forlorne: and sure the sorrow and indignation that he endured, had made him die in the place, if for all comfort he had not broken his silence with an imperfect spéech in this sort.</p>
               <p>Alas, miserable and wretched man, if thy knowledge did serue thée to act and effect the death of the duke of Fera, why was it not sufficient to preuent that of thine owne daughter? Ah in a cursed houre was I counsailed euer to take that deadly oportunitie. Manie other gréeuous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints poured hee out ouer those two dead bodies, who might be truly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to <hi>Piramus</hi> &amp; <hi>Thisbe:</hi> notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding after that he had shed ouer them many teares, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with innumerable sighs, he gaue order that a faire and rich tombe of brasse should be erected, in which after he had embaulmed them, according to the ancient ceremonie of funerall rites &amp; pomps, he caused both their bodies to be buried togither, with a great conuoy of mourners, and the Epitaph aforesaid to be engrauen round about the same. Some few daies after, thorow the griefe and melancholie he tooke, séeing himselfe depriued of his lawful heire, and in that behalfe the order of nature peruerted, he also lest this mortal life, but first did he shut vp &amp; make fast the treasures ofthe temple by such enchantment, and with so fearefull a guard, that since the time he died, the accesse vnto it hath bin very dangerous. So that vntill the time <hi>Marcomyr</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued there, no body could euer enter into it, albeit before <hi>Baledon</hi> had seased into his hands the Isle, a great number of knights of diuers countries had béene there to trie what they could do: and thither came also for the same effect the giant himselfe, who being in a great chafe, he could not tell how to approch y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, because the isle séemed to him plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly

               <p>But returning to our purpose, <hi>Marcomyr</hi> being arriued in this isle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> one of his marriners who knew al these things wel, told him of this mischieuous giant, and besought him in any wise not to anker in this port: for we shall all abide by it quoth he either dead or prisoners. How so, quoth <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> is there no man in the world who can abate his pride, and chastise his so great tiranny? If God helpe mée I will sée, séeing fortune hath guided me hether, and if I be sonne of the Emperor <hi>Cleodomyr</hi> I should not feare this lubberly kind of giants, resembling rather sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les brasen pillers in their monstrous statures, then any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine creatures, and lesse any other strange aduentures, be they neuer so difficult and dangerous: for if I will win praise and immortall honour, I must a long time follow the exercise of warfare, as he did in his yong yeres, domp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many such monsters, and atcheiuing fortunatly innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable enterprises: Turne then the prow to landward, and let vs enter hardly into the hauen, without making your selues affeard of this slouenly and villanous <hi>Golias:</hi> Then the Pilots, albeit sore against their will, leauing the shore directed the helme right betwéene the two rockes, where they were no sooner entered, but they saw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues shut in with the chaine which was hoised vp behind thera: whereat all of them were sore dismaied, except <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comyr</hi> and <hi>Ozalias,</hi> who equipping themselues with gant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and their helmets, which they had laid downe a little before to refresh themselues, did prepare to the defence, if peraduenture it came to any matter of blowes. The giant being aduertised there was in the hauen a rich ship fast en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed within the chaine, commanded his son to take arms and goe accompanied with some others to take them all prisoners which were come in: wherevnto the yong ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant obeied, and being well armed with thrée knights en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred

I haue truely béene so saucie this once, quoth <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> and the reason is, I make small account of cowards and base companions, such as thy selfe, who by damnable treacheries entrap people within this port, that you may afterward vse all crueltie and fellonie tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard them: but now it is time you receiue the due guerdon of all your execrable brutishnes. With these wordes the giant was so eager, and fell into such a rage, that hée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his rowers and marriners by and by to grapple fast to the ship of <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> thinking to enter as soone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

In the which if they two shewed the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good will that the one owed the other, yet <hi>Ozalias</hi> and the thrée knights of the Isle, made it appeare that they would not be scant good freindes together againe in hast. So fierce and sharpe appeared the conflict of two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst foure, that the sonne of <hi>Baledon</hi> féeling himselfe put to the foile by his enemie (whom he could not strike at his pleasure) resolued to put himselfe in hazard, when rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vp with his hand vpon the side of the hatches, hée thought to leape into the ship. But <hi>Marcomyr</hi> who slept not a winke in this skirmish, lighted a great blow vpon his arme, which sliced it quite from his shoulder: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the giant, by reason of the extreame paine he felt,

fell downe halfe dead within his vessell, making a noise as if it had béen the raine and fall of some Obelisque or Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mide. In the meane time <hi>Ozalias</hi> fetcht such a beake vpon the skull of one of the thrée knights, that he cleft him downe to the iawes: whereat the giants skippers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sore amated, retired as fast as they could row to get quickly to land:</p>
               <p>As soon as some of them were gotten on the sande, they ran with all spéed to giue <hi>Baledon</hi> vnderstanding of the spéedie dispatch of his sonne. When the giant heard the newes, he began to rore like a bull, with such a horrible and hoarse voice, crying: Ah, Ah, <hi>Iupiter</hi>! As my sonne dead, If so it bée, I will take the most cruell reuenge that euer was heard of: neuerthelesse I cannot thinke that the gods haue so farre forgotten themselues, as to destinate my sonne to so infortunate a disaster. Hauing ended this spéech, he commaunded his armes to be fetcht him incontinent, the which hée began to put on, when they brought vp into his chamber his sonne halfe dead, whom when his eies had séene, his heart began to rise so strangelie, that it had almost burst for sorrow. And of such inward bitternesse and passion did clearely demonstrate all his outward parts of his bodie, for besides he could not hold still nor armes nor legges, it séemed a burning flame of fire procéeded from his mouth, eies, and nose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrils.</p>
               <p>The two knights who had saued themselues in their barke, and some others also which had staied on the shore, spake a thousand outragious words and villanies to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comyr,</hi> assuring him one would spéedilie come, to make him die a cruell death. But <hi>Marcomyr</hi> answered, their reproches and menaces did moue him but a little, for their lord being a traitour and an inexecrable ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, their gods should know, it were not lawfull to suffer him to liue any longer in this world. And to

come vnto his desire he had good confidence in them they would giue him miraculous power. And if he be such quoth he, and so valiant as you make him, let him come hardly to encounter me in single combat, in the which if I bée so much fauoured of Mars and fortune that I get the victory, let him accomplish only what I shall bid him, and I will saue his life: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwise if I be vanquished of him, he may doe with me and mine what he shall best thinke good. Wherefore to the end hée know, I haue no feare of any such brauadoes, if he wil giue me safe conduct of the single combat, and assure me I shall not be hurt, but by himselfe, I will presently come a shore to defie him to the combat.</p>

In the meane time <hi>Baledon</hi> went to attend him in a plaine, hard vnder the castell, commaunding vpon paine of death all those of his side should not once stirre against his enemie. Who be holding but only his countenance and grim lookes trembled like an aspen leafe, meruelling this knight had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the heart to méet him face to face.</p>
               <p>Already the two champions haue drawne their swords, lie close vnder their sheildes, and begin so drerie a battell, smoaking one another, that you would haue iudged a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred smithes had ben a worke, beating their yron plates vpon their And-fields. But the giant raged, because his enemie held him so long resistance, therefore he charged him such a blow, that if he had not cunningly shrunke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side vnder his target, he had ben in danger to haue ended his life there. Wherefore the prince féeling himself in this perill, his stomacke and courage came to him more by half then it was before: and finding himselfe in such a furie as is the wild boare at the bay of the dogs when he is chased into the toiles, hit him such a gash vnder his roundache, with his full force, that peircing his harnesse cleane tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, he cut his flesh to the bone.

At length <hi>Baledon</hi> saw he could not strike his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie as he would by reason of his admirable dexteritie, wherewith he saued himself, and beat aside still his blows: purposed to come within him, to the end he might crush him in péeces with his foule great fiftes, so that he put his sword in his yron hangers, and then fell loutishly vpon him like a heauie log of wood: but <hi>Marcomyr</hi> holding his point firme against the giants bellie, which by chance had lighted in the iointing betwéene two plates, thrust it so farre in, that <hi>Baledon</hi> hauing his belliefull, waxed pale and chaunged his coulour: And although he pulled it out with his hands, yet by the aboundance of bloud that he lost by the two woundes which weakened more and more his strength, hée could not deale with him as hée de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.

               <p>When the giant perceiued himselfe in such dolefull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie, and so bad taking to defend himself, he murmured these words softly with a heauy chear.

When he had ended these lamentations (which none could well vnderstand, for death which had alreadie seased vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on part of <hi>Baledons</hi> carkas, caused him to strammer and to alter his spéech) he called the people to him, commanding they should forthwith bring the knight vp into the castell to consigne into his hands, all the prisoners which were in chaines, and to obey him in all things as if it were his own person. Then went <hi>Marcomyr</hi> and <hi>Ozalias</hi> with two or thrée oftheir people towards the pallace, where in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great base court they met with the giants wife, who lamented bitterly for the great mischance of her sonne and husband, cursing and blaspheming the knight who had plonged her in that goulfe of sorrow and anguish.

               <p>Unspeakeable was the pleasure and content they all receiued to become the Emperours vassals, wherefore he caused them all presently to sweare allegeance to him, and then to burne openly the bodie of <hi>Baledon</hi> for the most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norme and cruell a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Such is his rage, that so often as any offers himselfe to enter into the temple, this beast rowseth himselfe from his thorney and wild leare, shaking his head, cracking his téeth, and foming in fearefull sort: then shaking his bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellie bodie, hée launceth forth his bristles more sharpe then so manie rasors or arrowes with such a violence, that they pierce quite thorow the best armor, which may

But most of all, he torments them with his great tusks, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he committeth such carnage and slaughter vpon them, who assaile him, that he kils them as fast as they come néere him. You tell me wonders, quoth <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> yet is there no so difficult aduenture in the world, which may not and ought not to be by m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Soone prouided he what was necessary for such a voiage, for all his companie, both knights, marchants, and others which he had deliuered out of the prisons before, with whom they tooke some of the Isle to conduct them to the temple: Now had <hi>Marcomyr</hi> caused to be made by subtill and meruellous cunning workemanship, a coat of arms of many canuasses, glued together with waxe sticking fast together, with which he couered all his harnesse, to the end, the boores bristles being launced at him, might not hurt him at all but sticke fast therein: and with this his new gabardine did he march very merrie among the troupe towards the temple, néere vnto which they were now come, where he and <hi>Ozalias,</hi> vewing the place round about as far as they could sée, could perceiue nothing but thick briars, brambles, thornes and other prickly bushes, so enuironing the temple on euery side, that <hi>Marcomyr</hi> could find no way to enter in with his horse, which grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him much, wherefore he resolued to make abode there two daies, to sée what might be done: in the meane time came thither to him the people from all places néere hand, who had before heard of his fame spread abroad, for the victorie hée had obtained against the giant and his sonne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:23383:35"/>The third day after he armed himselfe with all his har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and put on vppermost vpon his habergion his new iacket, then taking in his hand a great mace of stéel, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he thought to aid himself in this passage, he went co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously towards the Temple, commaunding all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to tarry behind, wherat <hi>Ozalias</hi> and <hi>Rifaran</hi> were greatly grieued: neuerthelesse, not to contemne his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement they remained behind, &amp; fell to deuout praier, that it would please the gods to preserue him from daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death. <hi>Marcomyr</hi> began to enter the thickets (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king way with his great Mace) when hee saw a knight winding a great base horn before him: at the noice wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the furious and fearefull boare rushed out of his den, and setting his taile against the gate of the Temple, staid there for <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> with such a horrible crackling of his téeth, that the verie sight would haue affrighted the best man liuing.</p>
               <p>The Prince in the meane time had scant gotten a place large inough, which was on the side ofthe Temple, by which the brute animall spying him to come in amain, shewed himselfe farre more fierce and cruell than before. For then setting an ende his sharpe and ineuitable bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, he launced them so thick against him, as you would haue thought a dozen Archers could not so soone haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their arrows out of their bowes: but for as much as they lost their force by the defensible stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of his coat made of waxe for the nonst, they did not pierce his armor, as they had done to many other knights: by means were<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the boare hauing shot away all his darts, came furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie vpon him with an open mouth. Then <hi>Marcomyr</hi> (who stoode firme without stirring one way or other) lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp valiantly his great Mace, stroke him such a blow vpon the groyne, that hée tooke away one iawe, with part of his lower téeth. The boare féeling such a deadly stroke, would haue taken holde of him, to haue pulled him to the ground. But <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> drawing out
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:23383:36"/>
quickly his falchion, saued him that labour, by thrusting it déepe into his throate with all his force, pushing it still further in: The boare not able to endure the paine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyled backeward more and more, casting out so great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of gore blood at his mouth, that the knight was alberaied therwith: neuertheles, holding still his falchion firm in his throat with his left h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd, with the right he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled such monstrous blows with his mace of stéel, that he laid quickly along the infernal beast dead on the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. And albeit this were a naturall boare, yet hee was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted by some diuelish arte: for béeing come into this place by the exorcismes of the high priest, as were the Lions which slue the Duke of Fera, hée had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes charmed him to garde his treasure locked fast within the Temple, neuerthelesse hée was fatallie to die by <hi>Marcomyrs</hi> hand. And euen as that of Calidonia, which was sent thither to plague that Countrie, died by the hand of <hi>Meleager,</hi> who afterward sent his head in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the faire Ladie <hi>Atalanta,</hi> to shewe her the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of his strength: in like manner the Prince of Tarsus, to make his valour appeare to all those who should come thither, cut off the head of this, and in signe of spoyle and trophée, raysed it on the ende of a pole, which he planted in the same place, where he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcomyr</hi> hauing then dompted this terrible mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, he thanked the gods for so great fauour, and puld off his false iacke, which he had put ouer his armour, because the boares bristles sticking so thicke therein, it did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what annoy him. But hee had no sooner laid it downe, when he sawe the knight of the horne making towardes him with a great club in his hand, calling aloude to him with a horrible voice, In a cursed houre hast thou entred this desert, caitife Knight, for thou shalt presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue the recompence of thy presumptuous rashnesse. With that he gaue <hi>Marcomyr</hi> a vile knocke which made
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:23383:36"/>
one of his knées double to the ground vnder him: but hée béeing valiant and nimble, rose vp quicklie, and began to fetch about so brauely his stéele Mace in the ayre, that a furious and sharpe encounter began betwéene them: The blowes they laid one at the other were very easily heard to those who attended without for <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> whose eyes might verie well perceiue them by the sparkes of fire, which they sawe flie out of their harnesse, no more nor lesse then dooth the lightning which goeth before the rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the thunder, when the thunderbolts crackes and breakes asunder.</p>
               <p>The battell betwéene them was bloodie and cruell, continuing so long, till in the end being both wearie and tyred, they fell downe néere dead in the place, where <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comyr</hi> lay in a sownde till late in the euening, when hée came to himselfe againe, and rising vp verie deftly (for he felt no hurt, nor féeblenesse at all) he looked wishly round about him on all sides, and saw no enemie: wherefore he tooke vp his armes to enter into the Temple, the gates whereof shewed themselues alreadie open, which did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in him a farre greater desire to goe in. As soone as he was come néere the great portall, two brazen images which were placed on both sides the wall, began to blowe out thorow two tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pets which they held in their mouths, such a hot and sulpherie aire, that <hi>Marcomyr</hi> thought hée was fallen into the middest of a furnace perpetually bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And albéeit by this ayre he was many times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed backeward, yet stoode he not still in the way, but went forward with all his force (with great wearinesse and paine of his bodie) and still thrust himselfe onwarde till hee past the threshold, where as soone as hee had set his foote within the Temple, hee felt no more that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement heate, but in a moment became so coole and fresh as the day hee departed from Tarsus.

the high priests daughter, whereat he wondred much, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sumptuositie and riches thereof, besides the rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Art wherewith the building of the monument was supernaturally beautified. He beheld it on both sides, and viewing vpon the lamines of mettell which couered it, the rich sword wherewith she slue the most perfect of all damsels, there came into his minde an extreame desire to make it his owne: so he mounted vpon the iron bars and grates which compassed about the sepulchre, and tooke it in his hand to view it better at his ease: after he had curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie remarked the artifice thereof, wrought and grauen curiously, he put it to his girdle, and purposed to carrie it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with him. Then stept downe from the sepulchre to go further into the Temple, to séeke for the enclosure and cabinet wherein the treasure was hidden. But ere he had gone farre, hee found in the Sanctuarie thereof an aultar where the ancient sacrifices were offered vp, verie costly enriched, and an idoll all of massie golde, which wore an imperiall crowne vpon his head, and a scepter in his right hand, so rich and full of worke, that it were impossible to behold two iewels more rare: being garnished with great collers set with manie precious stones of inestimable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. Round about the aultar were set in order manie Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins of golde, filled with myrrhe, incense, and other swéete drugs, which did yéeld a most swéete and redolent sauour all ouer the place. Round about on the walles, did hang lampes of siluer alwaies burning, the light whereof did giue such a diuine splendour vpon the pearles and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stones, that it seemed there was some diuine maiestie before whom they did shine. <hi>Marcomyr</hi> was rauished in beholding these things, wherefore séeing it was then late and within night, he aduised not to depart thence till the morrow morning, to the end hee might contemplate bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at his pleasure all the singularities of that place.</p>

                  </gap>arth trembled vnder him round about, so that hée thought the temple would rent in sunder, or be swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp into the earth, and that the foure elements would haue all resolued into their ancient chaos. Such hideous cries, sighes, gronings and lamentations were heard by him, as he was in such a maze he could not tell what to do: and albeit fearing some new ambuscadoe, he drew forth his sword, yet could he not for all his magnanimitie and martiall valour stand vpon his legs, but fell downe astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and out of all sense, as if he had ben stroken with a thunderbolt. During this trance, a faire damsell richly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, (whom the old beldame, who did threaten so many things to him in Tarsus, had sent thither for the nonst) came to take him by the hand, saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And albeit you are now no Christian, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse from hence forth for my sake become one, for the time shall come you shall say: O thrice and foure times happie houre, you met with mée.

               <p>Wée néed not aske whether <hi>Marcomyr</hi> did meruaile, hearing the voice of the Damsell, who came to succour him in this austere desert, to decipher to him so well his affaires: For the extasie and rauish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his spirits, (who had then séene his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce) did giue sufficient testimonie thereof. Yet sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe in place fit to speake to this Damsell, hée called his spirits againe to him, and embouldened him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to say thus: Madame, for the honour and reuerence you beare vnto your God, I pray you not to conceale from me, who you are that know mée so well: and I beséech you therein excuse mine vnwise request, for your rare and perfect beautie, which doth prouoke mée to demaund it, doth draw mée into greater admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, then all the other strange visions which I

               <p>Courteous knight (quoth she) thinke not strange at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing I tell you, for it is long since I knew who you are, and for your prowesse and valour I loue you and estéeme you more then any other knight of this round world, therefore am I come hether, farre from the countrey where I was borne, to make you vnderstand it: Praying you to pardon mée otherwise if I doe not tell you who I am, for at this present your curiositie is not to bée satisfied herein: well will I assure you before long time passe, wée shall sée one another at pleasure together, and then shall you know something of my doings, by a gift which I will request at your hands, which is not now to be disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.

hower which you say is so happie for me: But in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, I wil accomplish for my part all that which it hath pleased you to giue me in charge, and will dedicate this temple to the seruice of your God, whose faith alreadie hath by your meane greatlie edified mée in this Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call truth.</p>
               <p>Whilst the Damsel gaue him thanks for this good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and for his so many amiable spéeches, behold the old beldame came who enchaunted him with the loue of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestina</hi> in his Kingdome, and taking this maiden by the hand saith to her: Come away with me my daughter, and leaue this discourteous and foolish Knight alone, who suffered me to be misued before his presence in Tarsus: for which abuse I hope full soone to bée reuenged on him, by the extreame anguish and passion his heart shall endure hereafter.</p>
               <p>Scarsely had she spoken these last words, but both of them vanished away at the very instant, whereat <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr</hi> maruelled much, and from that time forward entered into such a déepe conceit of the liuely and perfect beautie of this Damsell, that he had almost died with the thought thereof: for it séemed to him he had neuer séene her second, and in truth he was not deceiued in his iudgement in this matter, as many young louers bée, who in their owne loues shew themselues too fauourable iudges. By and by he thought with himselfe, because the old mother had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her away from hard by him, this Damsell must sure be <hi>Celestina,</hi> her for whom he felt so liuely imprinted in his heart, the loue which did encrease in him more euery day then other, at the onely remembrance of this ladie, and forced him first to abandon his kingdome. So great was then the perplexitie of his spirit, because of this amou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fantasie, that vnstopping the fludgates of his eies, hée shead a great streame of teares, which were tossed with the impetuous wind of his sighes, so thicke one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that during this torment, he was faine to exclaime
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:23383:39"/>
thus: Alas, olde mother, I knowe not what thou maiest bée, but well I finde thy spéeches to be true: O that in an ill houre for the happinesse of my life did <hi>Ozalias</hi> anger thée in my presence. Ah, cruell enemie, why hast thou so soone depriued my sight of the vnspeakable content it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, beholding this angelicall and diuine face? Thou diddest permit me to sée her, that I should loue her past all measure, albeit I know not how thy wordes haue pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced my heart so farre, that I could not taste of anie more sharpe and corosiue bitternesse: notwithstanding, if this be the obiect of <hi>Celestina,</hi> (who séemed to mee the fairest, and most exquisite péece, that euer presented it selfe to mine eye) I will neuer rest, till I haue met her once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>In this anguish of minde remained the knight long time, so astonished, as if hée had come from the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes, and accusing himselfe greatly of simplicitie, and want of courage, blamed the olde woman, who had cleane taken away his strength, vnable to stay the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell with him: whose presence and gracious spéeces did so content him, as hee thought him selfe in eternall blessednesse for the while. To bée briefe, as soone as hée perceyued the cleare morning to chase towardes the West the darkenesse of the night, hee resolued to effect all that the vision did commaund him: wherefore he went straight to the Aultar where the riches was, and taking the golden basins, with all the other sumptuous things, hee laide them all on a heape, to carrie them out of the Temple, and spoiled moreouer the idoll of his scepter and crowne which he had about him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Abenunq</hi> then sailing merrilie towards the coast of Thrace, he met with <hi>Olurites</hi> king of Culaquin, and sonne in law to the great Turke, who was estéemed one of the most valiant and noble knights amongst all the Turkish nobilitie, and therefore had the barbarous tyrant bestowed on him his daughter, one of the fairest ladies which was in all the Heathen dominion. This king <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curites,</hi> who knew the emnitie and old grudge betwéene the Emperour and his father in law the Turke, rigd out a nauie, to gratifie him the more, and kéeping along the coast of Gréece, sent alwaies before him pinnaces and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates to discouer the Christian failes: so that he caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him many slaues and captiues then, when hée began to lie in the wind for the Soldans sonne. So soone as this Rouer knew the Prince of Babilon by his flagges and streamers he purposed to set vpon him with a great furie, for he knew his father was the Emperours great friend, and as he had chéered vp his men to the fight, hée came vpon <hi>Abenunq</hi> his ship, who séeing this vnlooked for encounter, set his men brauely in order to receaue him:</p>

Euill for thy profite didst thou euer thinke, king <hi>Ocurites</hi> to domage so good a prince as is the Emperour of Constantinople: and séeing <hi>Ozalias</hi> at his side readie to second him in all attempts, they ran pell mell into the thickest of the troupe, where they made so sharpe and cruell a battell, that they forced the enemies to retire towards their admirall. Who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ouer the Christians with whom he fought, those whom the Soldan had sent towards the Emperour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reproch and reuile his owne men, who ran away like dogs from the presence of two single knights.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ocurites</hi> being not able to resist the furie ofthe stroakes which his aduersarie lighted on him so thicke and thrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, was forced to knéele on ground with one knée. Hée thought to rise vp quickly again, but <hi>Marcomyr</hi> disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, for he gaue him such a knock with his shield, that he laid him along vnder his souldiers féet, who séeing their king so easily vanquished, were put into such a feare, that it was not long after before they carried away the worst, and were taken prisoners for their labour. For the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian knights which defended the poup, came downe to their aid, so that their ship was taken, and in <hi>Marcomyrs</hi> hands, who went presently to the king, and for hée would not kill him nor doe him more harme, onely vncased his helmet from his head, and caused him to be put into a cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban néere the kéele of the ship, vnder the guard of foure va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant knights. Whereof <hi>Alenunq</hi> being aduertised, who looked euery houre for his owne death or imprisonment,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:23383:46"/>
leapt quickly vpon the orlop of the ship where hée saw <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> and thanking him a thousand times, for this good succour, requested very courteously to tel him who be was.</p>
               <p>As the knight began to answeare the Prince of Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, perceiuing him to be the chiefe of al his crue, hée heard a great noise about his ship, it was the brother of king <hi>Ocurites</hi> who hauing vnderstood the ouerthrow of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and how he was prisoner, grappeled himselfe to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benunqs</hi> vessell, into which he entered brauely maugre all those who did make him resistance, knocking downe on euery side, as if it had béene vpon some yron barre hamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the smiths Antfield. And as <hi>Marcomyr</hi> saw so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enemies readie with their arms in hand, hée left the Soldans sonne to run vpon them, which he did with such a rage, that no man can recount the warlike exploits and wonderfull feats of armes he performed in this recharge: for with one blow which he smot <hi>Ocurites</hi> brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the cuirasse and the head peice, he cut his head cleane from his shoulders. Many others forced he to féele the strength of his arme, for ere they had long stood before him, he sent their souls one after another into the infernal lake, making such a bloudie anatomie of these dogs, that it was a great horrour to behold what a slaughter there was. Neuerthelsse so great was the furie he was faine to abide in this skirmish, that he could not escape without two wounds, which were the first he receiued, albeit hée had before fought with the fierce giant <hi>Baledon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when <hi>Marcomyr</hi> had so manfully behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the dispatch of so mightie an enemie, he still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued his point vpon some other ships of warre, which hée saw yet in fight with those of the Soldan, therefore went he aboord <hi>Ocurites</hi> gallion to reléeue them with some spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die succour: wherof as soone as the Turks were aware, they began to run into such a feare and perplexitie, that part of them were forced to flie disorderly, and run foule

               <p>These words came from his mouth, but in his mind he had another determination, for as soone as he heard of the iousts in Constantinople, he determined to go thether se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly without any other manifestation of himselfe, but only in shew of a strange knight, called <hi>Marcomyr</hi>: with this excuse he tooke leaue of <hi>Abenunq,</hi> who offered him many presents, but he would accept none, thanking him much for his good will, especially of the assurance he gaue him not to depart any way from the Emperours court, vntill he arriued there, for hée made him a promise before many daies were past, he would appeare there in person, as he requested him to giue the Emperour to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, then bidding him adiue, entered aboord his ship, commanding his maister to lanch out a contrary way.</p>

emperor being aduertised, demanded what meant this troupe of prisoners, when one of the principal knights of <hi>Abenunq</hi> who went before to make them march in order, answered in this sort, If it please your maiestie, it is the king of <hi>Culaquin,</hi> sonne in law to the great Turke, who departed his countrie with a puissant and huge armie to endomage and ruin your empire. By this traitor had the prince <hi>Abenunq</hi> son to the Souldan of Babilon your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, and all his traine ben put to sword or to the chaine, had it not ben for the succour of a knight called <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr,</hi> second to none other, who rescued vs, and hath now sent him prisoner to you.</p>
               <p>These good newes much pleased the Emperour, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Marcomyr</hi> had béene come with <hi>Abenunq,</hi> neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, as soone as he vnderstood he had left him beehind at the streight of <hi>Sestos</hi> and <hi>Abidos</hi> he was wroth and sore displeased: surely quoth he, albeit it gréeueth me I cannot haue him in my house to recompence him as his prowesse and courtesie deserueth, yet hereof may the king <hi>Ocurites</hi> well vaunt himselfe: for were it not for respect of the knight by whom he is vanquished and sent vnto me, I should torment him all the daies of his life with sharpe and cruell punishment, to make him call to mind the fellonie he hath heretofore shewed towards my vassals freinds and confederats.

and acquaintance betwéene these two, hoping both one day to be companions in arms together. <hi>Abenunq</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed then the summe of <hi>Marcomyrs</hi> message, and could neuer satisfie himself with sufficiently commending his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall bountie and vnspeakeable valour, so that the good prince was stil inflamed more and more to sée this knight, for whom he blessed and praised God, who had infused so many perfections into him: the which <hi>Rifaran</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chefin</hi> did confirme by this little word, that there can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be so much good and honour spoken in his praise, but the merit of his vertues would far excéed the capacity of the most learned and eloquent tongue which should bée emploied to that purpose. After that <hi>Abenunq</hi> had deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red some other matters of his embassage to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, he went to sée the Empresse in her chamber, and as he would haue bowed himselfe to kisse her hand with the more reuerence, the honourable ladie rising vp from her seat to saue him that labour, receaued him wonderfull courteously, and at large demanded him the newesfrom <hi>Archidiana</hi> his mother: whom the prince answered in al points very sagely, as from his childhood he had ben lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to doe: then came to embrase him swéetly the infant <hi>Philocrista</hi> and <hi>Esquiuela</hi> her companion, who could not tell what countenance to make for the extreame ioy shée felt in her mind, hauing before her eies the second highest hope of her heart: and albeit she did all she might to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble it, she was constrained notwithstanding in the end to fill the eares of the assistants with these spéeches:</p>

               <p>In the meane time the Emperour he caused a triumph to be published thorowout all Gréece, and vpon the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téenth day following, should the marriage be solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly celebrated, so that you might haue séene what an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of knights flocked daily to the court from all parts. Amongst others thether came <hi>Linides</hi> lord of the island Liquia, he that had done more valiant acts in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture of <hi>Celestina</hi> then any other aduenturer: And of a truth was thought to be one of the best men at armes at that time in all the Empire, thorow the which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready spread the fame of this feast.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:23383:49"/>
attending the triumph, he should find two knights readie in the field, who would hold them play: for so had they the night before laid their plot.</p>
               <p>As soone as the squire had published his message in the pallace, the Duke <hi>de Pera</hi> vnderstanding thereof, made this answeare to him: Gentleman my friend, returne you to these champions, and tell them from me, there will be one in the field by and by, who taketh delight in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, &amp; will not refuse to breake a lance or two with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. With this answere came backe the squire to the two cousins, whose embassage when the emperour had vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, he imagined with himselfe, these two knights must néeds be <hi>Marcomyr</hi> and <hi>Ozalias</hi> his cousin, whereof hée was excéeding glad: and sent <hi>Rifaran</hi> to take a view of them, who mounting quickly on horsebacke, found <hi>Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> disarmed at the entrance of his tent, and his cousin the Countie readie armed at al points, except his helmet, which was off his head, whom when he knew not, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded whether they were the challengers who had sent to defie the knights of the court: whereunto the lord of Liquia answered, They were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> men: to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> replied <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faran</hi> againe: You haue vndertaken a matter which you shall at your ease enioy but a small while, but I beléeue you haue done it expresly to méet with some one quicklie, who might apparantly represse and abate your pride. When it shall fall out so, quoth <hi>Linedes,</hi> we shall but kéep others companie, who when they cannot bring to passe their enterprises, remain only frustrate of their desseigns: therefore we pray you take no care for our affairs, or else goe arme your selfe: for it is the act of a knight to fight with his sword, and not with his tongue, otherwise you shall infringe the order which euery valiant man ought to hold deare as his life.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Rifaran</hi> had ended these words, he tooke his leaue of them to returne towards the Emperour, whom he assured it was not <hi>Marcomyr</hi> nor <hi>Ozalias:</hi> albeit they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:23383:50"/>
séemed to be both two braue and hardie knights, and could not be but some puissant and great personages, by their outward apparance. Then went forth many good knights to proue themselues against the County, who for all that carried away the honour from them all without any aid from <hi>Linedes</hi> at all, who all the while neuer laid hand to shield nor lance, so that the Emperour who was there in the field to see them run, said he neuer saw knight in his life that carried his lance better, nor ran with a better grace then did this champion, of whom he had much maruell, considering his smal corpulence and yong age. Through all the court there was almost none other spéech but of the dexterity and fine cariage which he vsed in his Iousting, whereupon <hi>Rifaran</hi> and <hi>Lechefin</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to run against him: notwithstanding they would not doe it till the last day, to the end the County and <hi>Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> his cousin being vanquished by them, their Prowesse might be knowne, and spoken of aboue all those who should haue receiued any foile in the Iousting.

The elder of the brethren had to name <hi>Arnedes,</hi> who was a wise and valiant knight, and set all his delight in managing armes, and continuall exercise of matiall disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. Now king <hi>Lewis</hi> séeing his sonne was marriagea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, withdrew him one day aside into his chamber, where he began thus: My son, so extreame is the naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the good will I bear towards you, that I would by no means séeke to doe any thing which might not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent you as well as my selfe: this I speake, because your most honourable Grandfather of good memorie being in his latter age, gaue me charge to match you in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with the Emperour of Constantinoples daughter, to the end the children which should be borne of you both, might ressemble in some things their famous and so much renowned ancestors. Wherefore I am determined spéedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to send mine embassador to him for to sollicite this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, whereunto I beléeue he will giue consent most willingly, and well can I assure you my sonne, that this Princesse, named <hi>Philochrista,</hi> of age betwéene fiftéen and sixtéene yeares, is one of the fairest and most beautifull creatures, which nature euer brought forth vnder the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the spheares. <hi>Arnedes</hi> when he heard his father deale so secretly with him about such a matter, besought him humbly not to trouble himselfe any further therein, as yet, for he would put him in mind thereof another time more fit for the purpose: the king séeing him so cold, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the matter. But the yong prince who had heard of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:23383:51"/>
surpassing beautie of <hi>Philocrista</hi> (who had not her like in all the regions of the leuant) and of the déeds of Chiualrie done by knights in the court of the Emperour <hi>Cleodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr</hi> her father, he could neuer remoue her out of his mind, but in him from day to day, still encreased a most seruent desire to passe to Constantinople, with intent, if this lady liked him to demand her in mariage of her father, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto if he would not giue consent, to exploit such feats of armes in the countries of Gréece, that the honour thereof should at his returne accompanie him homewards. Such was the proiect of his desseigne, which he imparted very willingly to <hi>Recindos</hi> his cousin, sonne to the Castilian king, &amp; a most valerous and hardie knight, who encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to put it in practise, that it might take effect: vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he would til death alwaies kéepe him good &amp; loial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie: and the worst were, they could gouern themselues so wisely by disguising of their persons, places, and diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of language in this busines, that no man liuing should be able to descrie their persons, or discouer their drifts. The plot thus laid betwéene these two cousins, to take vpon them this voiage, he went strait to his father, who very willingly gaue him his leaue, vpon condition hée should stay as little while as might bée in those countries of the leuant.</p>
               <p>So kissing his father the kings hand, tooke his leaue in the secretst manner which might be, taking along with him but onely thrée or foure persons, with his dwarfe, and <hi>Recindos</hi> his cousin, whom he loued from the entierest of his heart. Towards Marsilia they made with as much spéed as might be, where finding a ship ready for them equipped, they waighed ankers, and set sailes, but had the weather so contrary, that being wearie of trauelling the tempestuous sea, they were faine to put into the first port of Gréece, and send awaie their ship by sea to méet them at Constantinople. One whole day soiourned <hi>Arnedes</hi> &amp; <hi>Recindos</hi> in this hauen, and on the morrow hauing put on

The County séeing a knight appeare vpon the barres, mounted presently on horsebacke, with a still presumption to coole quickly this assailants braua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe, but he was farre deceiued: for gallopping as fast as they could, they made such a furious encounter, that they brake their lances within their gantlets, finishing their carier without other harm: then said the countie to <hi>Arne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> Sir knight it is at your choice to haue another bout, if you think good. Content, I am readie, quoth the prince of France, séeing I haue done so little good with the first: then to shew their best before the emperour and other good knights who were there present, they made the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond encounter with a far greater furie then the first, in such sort, that the very earth séemed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that without breaking, <hi>Arnedes</hi> caried him to the ground with his courtelax, neuerthelesse he lost his stirrops with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out euer stirring out of his seat.</p>
               <p>The Emperour and all the other lords were very glad séeing the pride of the county laid along, so that they did al highly commend the vnknowne knight. <hi>Linedes</hi> was full wroth when he saw his cousin lie on the ground before him, in very ill taking by reason of his fall, wherfore cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his helmet to be laced (being before armed at al other points) he was soone mounted, and taking a great launce in hand, <hi>Arnedes</hi> and he rusht vpon one another in a great rage. <hi>Linedes</hi> was so chollericke; that hée mist his blow, neuerthelesse his enemie mist not to hit him so full that he bore him backward ouer his horse crouper, and because he would not let goe the raines of the bridle, thinking to saue himselfe from the ground, his horse rose an end, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ell backward vpon him, which brused him very sore, whereby he felt great paine a good while after. But <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedes</hi> was as fresh after this Iousting, as if he had not ben in it at all, therefore retiring to his companion, thus quoth he to him: Come let vs goe kisse the Emperours hand, for here is nothing more for vs to doe. Off did they their helmets, and went toward the troupe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led greatly at the valiancie of the Frenchman: For eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one knew how much <hi>Linedes</hi> was estéemed through al the land of Gréece.</p>
               <p>The Emperour séeing they made the next way to him, went before apace to welcome them: when they offered to kisse his hand: he would not permit, because he did not know them, but embraced them both louingly, saying: My friends ye are most welcome into my countrie, where you haue made me wonderfull ioifull by your great valor performed in your persons: therefore I pray you tell me who you are, and I shall loue and estéeme you a great deale the better: then quoth <hi>Arnedes,</hi> It is the grace and vertue of your maiesty, who honoureth alwaies knights,

although they little deserue it: we are knights of the house of the king of France: for my part I am a néere kinsman of <hi>Lewis</hi> duke of Burgondy. In good faith quoth the Emperour, your phisiognomie, feature, and all the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments of your body doe bewray you: for that in them you doe very much resemble him, and therefore do I loue you so much the more, for the great honour and pleasure that I haue heretofore receiued of him and his brother. So taking the one in his right hand and the other in the left, he conducted them both into his pallace, where after they were disarmed, he did them the greatest honor which he and all his might possibly deuise.</p>

In the meane while he and <hi>Ozalias</hi> disguising their armours, for fear to be discouered, departed with foure squiers onely for their seruice. That night they lodged by chance at the foot of a hill in the house of a knight, poore in goods, but noble in heart and person, who inuited them very chearfully, and

               <p>At supper time after much other talke, the old knight demanded of his guests, if they went to the triumph at Constantinople, for, quoth he, I came from thence yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, wondring much at the great number of nobles, who are come thether alreadie to be present thereat.

Of a truth sir, answered the good old man, it is euen as I say, neuerthelesse I am of this beliefe, if <hi>Belcarin</hi> sonne to the king of Hungarie, and brother to the betrothed <hi>Ditreus</hi> had ben there, he would haue depriued the French man of the victory, which he won from the County and <hi>Linedes</hi> his cousin: séeing they haunt chiualries and worthy feats of armes, for the which he is more and more renowned daily, in guarding the aduenture of <hi>Celestina.</hi> Nor was there euer knight who arriued there to proue himselfe in the enchaunted combat, since he made his assay in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, whom he hath not surmounted and happily van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished, so that <hi>Celestina</hi> is yet fast enclosed within the Fairies tower, and shal be vntil some knight morefortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and aduenturous then <hi>Belcarin,</hi> deliuer her thence.

                  </gap>eised in such manner his members, that in an instant he changed his coulour many times, and his very soule altered all her powers at this only word of <hi>Celestina.</hi> Wherefore with all instancie the knight praied his host to declare of what race this Damsell was descended, and to discourse at large to him the aduenture, wherein these knights went to trie themselues, thinking to deliuer her: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in what countrie was the castell where the Fairies had deuised this enchantment, for that oftentimes he had heard spéech therof, but neuer man could tel him the truth thereof. Sir, then quoth the old man, vnderstand the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell (one of the fairest and most gracious princesses, as is knowne in this terrestriall habitation betwéene the two tropicks of heauen) is daughter to the king of Thessalie, now prisoner to the great Turke, and was from her cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle fatally enclosed in the castell of Carderie by thrée en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanteresses, ladies of that Isle: who foresaw by their art Magick, that her father who was their great freind, should neuer get out of captiuitie from the infidell, but by the meane ofsome accomplished and perfect knight. So did they deuise the inchantment, that the fame ofthe beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this damsel, which they had spread throughout al the regions round about, or els the desire to win the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Thessalie (for he who could set her frée from thence, espousing her to wife, should inherit it after the death ofthe captiue king) would prouoke good knights to trie their fortune in that aduenture: and indéed many repaire thether vpon hope to exploit so happie a conquest, as <hi>Belcarin</hi> himselfe, who thought to atchieue it at the first: but his strength comming too short, as also that of many others, he resolued to make the accesse to this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse more difficult, vntill he for whome the princesse of Thessalie was destinated, should arriue there, endued

with so much valour and magnamitie as should make him by force auoid the place.</p>
               <p>This good gentleman told <hi>Marcomyr</hi> many stories of <hi>Celestina,</hi> the which he heard attentiuely: with the which his spirit was so much moued, that then he beléeued the words of the old beldame would proue true, and séeing she was able to tell him so many things of <hi>Celestina,</hi> shée might be very well one of the Fairies which did deuise this enchantment, the abolition whereofhe supposed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer afterward was only reserued to him: whereof he felt an incredible ioy in his heart, which prict him forward to prosecute the aduenture. Wherfore he called to him one of his squiers, commanding him to lay vpon the table all the rich iewels and rings, he had at that time, wherof he frankely gaue away the greatest to the good old man and to his daughter, praying him to marry her honourably, and he would furnish a sum of money for a dowery, and all other things necessarie for her marriage. From thence he tooke his iourney very secretly with <hi>Ozalias</hi> towards Constantinople, and lodged that night within two miles of the citie, where they aduised not to shew themselues, but only vpon the two first daies, and then to depart away to take their voiage towards the isle of Carderie.</p>

By meanes wherof she began to make him discourse of many excellent matters, which she could do meruellous well by reason of the ripe vnderstanding and fine grace wherewith nature had enriched her. For she néeded not to betaught to vse her tongue affably and discréetly.</p>
               <p>Here by the way, <hi>Recindos</hi> was so enflamed with her loue, that as long as he liued, the heat so liuely kindled, dwelt in his heart that it could neuer be quenched after that time.

               <p>In this iollitie past they that day away with great pleasure and content, till the houre the bridegroome and bride were to goe to bed: when the Empresse her selfe brought the Princesse <hi>Esquiuela</hi> into the bride chamber, where she left her in a bed, which was richly prepared for her, and the Emperor himselfe brought <hi>Ditreus</hi> into the same, and soone after euery one retired into his lodging: <hi>Arnedes</hi> amongst the rest, the ioisullest man liuing in his mind, brake thus with <hi>Recindos:</hi> How like you cousin, the beauty of <hi>Philocrista</hi>? did you euer sée a more rare and perfect péece? Ah, I must néeds hasten the end of this my most vrgent businesse: to giue some howers of quiet rest to the anguish of my poore passionate heart, wherfore I am determined to dispatch a post to the king my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the end he send hether honourable embassadors, who shall conclude this marriage with the Emperour. Meane while I will sound the depth of this amourous ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and I will sée whether the knowledge and wisdome of the spirit of <hi>Philocrista</hi> be correspondent to her singuler
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:23383:56"/>
beautie: and if so be her inward vertue second the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, wherewith nature hath outwardly endued her, I may repute my selfe the most happie and fortunate knight, who liueth vnder the zones of the heauen, hauing her once in my power.</p>
               <p>Surely sir replied <hi>Recindos,</hi> you may truly praise her, and I pray vnto God in deuout and humble praier, our comming may succéed as well in my behalfe, as I beléeue it will fall out shortly in yours: for as touching my mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if the grace and courtesie of <hi>Melissa</hi> doe not giue mée some succourable comfort, I may well assure you, it had bene better for me I had neuer set foot in these countries. Then <hi>Arnedes</hi> tooke him in his arms and embraced him, saying: O how glad and eased am I by these your words, which haue pleased my hearing aboue all other: Séeing by them I sée you are my companion in all things, repose I pray you your firme hope in him, on whom depend all things, who by his deuine bounty shall direct our actions so well, that with time they shall sort a happie effect. And if it please him to fauor mine affairs that they cary aright and succéed, I will worke yours till they compasse the matter you leuell at. Courage then, and let vs make the Gréeks know France bréedeth as good knights and men of as great valor as any nation in the world.</p>

of six thousand; all choice men and braue champions, when they began to come to hands, you might heare the aire ring on euery side with drums and trompets, which sounded the assault, and forthwith the combattants run together, crashing their lances, hacking and hewing one another with their cemitories and courtelaxes. There might you haue séene a thousand blazing starres, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the glitring of so many braue frontstals, helmets, sheilds, and guilded armours, faire burnished and shining bright as the sun, or as the Carbuncles in a darke place. Then might you sée vpon their helmets so many rich plumes, mottoes, pensels and fauours, where hanged the deuises and coulors of the ladies of many knights, that it was an admirable thing to behold them: and most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for vs to recount all the other excellencies and sumptuosities of this assembly: neither is it of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of our historie to report.</p>
               <p>At the first encounter were many knights strangers laid along: the Courtiers behaued themselues gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and had surely carried away the honour of the day, had not <hi>Linedes</hi> and the Earle his cousin stept in, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling two furious lions, brusht them so thorowly on euery side (to be reuenged of the shame they had receaued by <hi>Arnedes</hi> meane) that no man durst come néere them. These then did maintaine the field, and did meruellous feats of armes: but <hi>Arnedes</hi> who of purpose held on the contrarie part, séeing himselfe in presence of his deare Ladie <hi>Philocrista,</hi> in place where shée might well iudge of his Chiualrie, thrust himselfe without feare into the thickest of them, and did meruailous actes with his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>Now the Emperour who knew well the valour and dexterity of the best, séeing the great and admirable feats of armes exploited by the readie addresse of his bodie, thought with himselfe the words of the lady who came into his court, would be now verified, to wit: that there
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:23383:57"/>
should arriue knights from strange countries who should surpasse his in magnanimitie and prowesse. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he did greatly reioice to sée <hi>Rifaran</hi> make his valor so well knowne amongst the rest, for he neuer couched launce in vaine, but some knight went to the ground. So violent was the martial furie of these men at armes who held on the Courtiers side, that their aduersaries had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ben able to stand before them, if <hi>Marcomyr</hi> and <hi>Oza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> had not by chance ioined to their succor. <hi>Ozalias</hi> came first to the conflict, where he began to strike such full stroakes, that quickly he made them know in what sports he knew best to employ the force of his armes and by and by arriued <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> carying a coat of armor red, and vpon a sheild in a gréene field painted with a little flower argent, which he deuised for this purpose, because hée would not be knowne of <hi>Abeuunq</hi> nor of <hi>Rifaran,</hi> who had séene him often in the other equippage. Before he entred into the Iousts, he staid a good while to behold the citie of Constantinople, then casting his eies very curiously one while vpon the Emperour his father, who sat aloft vpon the scaffolds, with many nobles and Barons round about him, another while vpon the empresse, and her ladies and gentlewomen, who were there to accompanie her, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled to sée there so great number of nobilitie and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, wherefore he said thus to himselfe: O soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne God, creator and director of all things, I find my selfe infinitely bounden to serue and obey you, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence you more then any other of your creatures, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing giuen me such a father, who beside he is reputed the best knight borne vnder the starres, you haue moreouer created him the greatest Prince who raigneth this day vpon the earth: now séeing you haue graunted me so ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimable a fauor to be borne of so rare and excellent a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage, I must do my best indeuour to resemble him, and to shew in somthing I am his son: for albeit I now Ioust against the knights of his court, I beléeue hée shall haue
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:23383:57"/>
none occasion to reprehend me in ought, when he shall know the good zeale I haue to doe him seruice in al other things: his courage encreased so much, as he had spoken these words, in séeing himselfe before the Emperor his father, that setting spurs to a strong courser which cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, he roughly entered the lists, where before he had broken his lance, he sent many knights to the ground, then began to lay about him so lustily, and with his great cemitorie to doe so many wonderfull acts, that those of his part taking courage, raunged themselues into order by him, and came vpon the courtiers till they abandoned the place. Knowing then <hi>Arnedes</hi> surpassed al the rest in feats of armes, he gaue him so sturdy a blow vpon the helmet, that he made him goe against his will astonished to the ground: at the same instant with another stroake smot <hi>Pernedin</hi> eldest son to the duke of Pera, besides his horse, who was estéemed one of the brauest knights in all Gréece. Which hardie <hi>Rifaran</hi> perceiuing, came vpon <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> his sword charged in his hand, wherewith he hit him two such blowes one after another, that he made him féele the smart thereof a good while after: but he had quickly his reuenge: for <hi>Marcomyr</hi> was in such a fury a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him that he neuer left him till he had his paiment and was dismounted. Then angrie as a lion, he stroke on euery side with such a great might, that none durst stand before him. <hi>Recindos</hi> séeing his cousin <hi>Arnedes</hi> disarsoned, tooke in hand a great lance, to run against his aduersarie with a poulder: but <hi>Marcomyr</hi> spying him come towards him, tooke as good a one out of his squiers hands, (who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies attended néere him with sword and lance to furnish him at his néed) and running furiously one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they encountred as mortall enemies, <hi>Marcomyr</hi> pierced <hi>Recindos</hi> shield and armour, and giuing him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wound, bore him ouer his horse crouper to the ground: he was also a little wounded in his breast with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies sword, wherewith he was so mad, that with the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:23383:58"/>
first blow he stroke afterwards, he sent <hi>Lechefin</hi> to bear him companie in the place, who albeit he were but young in years, he was neuerthelesse skilfull in armes and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and till that hower had behaued himselfe most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly at all assaies.</p>
               <p>Who could euer declare the admirable chiualries <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comyr</hi> did in this martiall conflict? certainly the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror wondred much at them, (being ignorant who it might be) for he auered he neuer saw accomplished knight of so great prowesse. The like did <hi>Diocles,</hi> who had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame desire to know his name, wherevnto <hi>Abenunq</hi> answered, he thought it was <hi>Marcomyr</hi>: for quoth he, he resembleth him very much in the proportion of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Uery glad was the Emperor of that newes, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to send a messenger to desire him to conceale himselfe no longer, being so néere him, but should come to make himselfe knowne in place where he was so much desired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abenunq</hi> would néeds goe himselfe with thrée or foure other knights in his companie, but he found it so hard to passe the throng, that he could neuer come néere him, whereby he was constrained to returne without him. But <hi>Marcomyr</hi> hearing the voice of all the people giuing him the honor and price at the triumph, hauing thrée lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wounds, wherof the greatest was that which the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish prince gaue him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> returned in hast to the good ould knights house, where he had lodged before. Whether <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zalias</hi> the same night retired also in good health, whereof <hi>Marcomyr</hi> was right glad: in this place he soiorned two daies to cure his wounds, from whence he tooke his way towards the kingdome of Macedon with the same arms he bare in the triumph, hauing <hi>Celestina</hi> continually in his thoughts.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Shamed and greatly abashed were the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed knights at the hard vsage they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> and <hi>Arnedes</hi> more then the rest, for he had bentwise vnhorsed before his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <hi>Philocrista:</hi> whereupon he purposed to auenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self or to die in it, as likewise did many others afterward, who fell in a mutinie against him. The Emperor soone perceiued it well, and came to <hi>Arnedes, Recindos</hi> and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faran</hi> to remoue this fantasie out of their heads: he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them a smiling and merrie countenance, bidding them neuer to be vexed further for the matter: because they had well made knowne their great valor and chiualrie, and therefore he requested them at the next tourney, by some meane to recognish the knight who was vanquisher. If he come quoth <hi>Arnedes,</hi> it shal be peraduenture smally to his aduantage, for hauing foiled so many as he hath, the sport cannot well end, but he will smart for it After these spéeches the Emperor conducted them to his pallace, where he feasted them very louingly, and long continued this roiall feast throughout all his court, wherein was heard no other talke butof the knight of the Flower.</p>

meruelling at these spéeches, purposed to goe in quest after him so soone as the tourney was ended, if peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he returned not in the meane season thether againe: and those who had this determination were <hi>Arnedes, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cindos, Rifaran, Lechefin</hi> and <hi>Pernedin</hi> the Duke of Pera his sonne, who without saying word to each other resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to die euery man, or to bring the knight of the Flower before the Emperor, if they could méet with him in any part of the world. Supper done, <hi>Diocles</hi> and <hi>Ditreus</hi> tooke with them <hi>Arnedes</hi> and <hi>Recindos,</hi> and went to sit among the ladies, where <hi>Arnedes</hi> compassed so much fauor as to sit next his <hi>Philocrista,</hi> and <hi>Recindos</hi> hard by the Infant <hi>Melissa.</hi> There receiued they vnspeakeable pleasure and content, séeing themselues néere the quicke and burning flame which heated them more strangely a farre off, then néere hand: so that through the extreame ioy which by little and little crept into their hearts, they began some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to blush, as falleth out most often in such amorous alarmes. Neuerthelesse letting their eies gaze their fill, to glut them with the liuely beautie obiect to them (albeit the heart desired ioissance of a far greater ioy) they began to chat of many things with them, and among the rest of the great prowesse which the vnknowne knight had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the tourney: but the infant <hi>Philocrista</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing how these purposes might be griefesome to <hi>Arnedes,</hi> wherefore she encountred him thus:</p>
               <p>Sir knight, you haue none occasion to be vexed or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie for any thing happened vnto you, for the best knights remaine sometime surmounted: we haue well beheld your valiancie, nor haue the vanquishers lesse cause to bée sorrie and gréeue at your comming thether; then the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished had at that of the knight with the Flower: whom none of vs know. <hi>Arnedes</hi> was so glad to heare these words out of <hi>Philocristaes</hi> mouth, that scant could he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere one word: yet loue which had fast hold of him, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouldened him in the end to speake (with a voice which

well might witnes the delight his heart conceiued in this suddaine and vnexpected ioy:) Madame quoth he, the courtesie and excellent grace wherewith nature hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinely accompanied the perfection of your beautie, inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth you to giue me this praise, albeit my valor merit not to approch the least part of that which it pleaseth you to say: and if I haue neuer so little, I should there shew it, séeing my selfe before her, who hath such preheminence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer me that with one winke of her eie she may augment my courage, and make my force inuincible: therefore shall my desire neuer be satisfied, till I haue reconquered my fortune which hath brought me from so farre to this tourney, the successe whereof giueth me a pain and griefe more intollerable, then doth to <hi>Sisiphus</hi> the stone which he rouleth continually in the infernall lake. I pray God hasten your attempt therein, procéeded <hi>Philocrista,</hi> I wish it with all my heart: for it were against al reason (hauing taken so great paine as you haue, to come from so remote a countrie to sée my father the Emperor) you should reape so bitter fruit of your trauell. With this swéet and fauora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reply the ioy of the French prince was redoubled, so that he softly thanked <hi>Philocrista</hi> with many amorous signes and tokens, whereby she strait knew the passion of his heart whence they procéeded was vehement, and in a meruellous disturbance. <hi>Recindos</hi> in like case entered so far in discourse with <hi>Melissa,</hi> that he discouered to her the affection he had to be her knight, which she accepted most willingly, pleasing her selfe more then of any other, with his beautie, valor, and modest behauior, whereof the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall and stedfast regard of his eies beholding this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse were a manifest argument.</p>
               <p>Whilst these did swim indelights with their ladies, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing their hearts inflamed with the burning sparkes of loue, <hi>Lechefin</hi> felt himselfe gnawne with an insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble iealousie, séeing <hi>Philocrista</hi> talking with his corriuall, insomuch that he wisht to haue him at his ransoming in

And if the Emperor did call for him in the meane time, he should make him that answere: in like manner to his cousin <hi>Recindos,</hi> who was for his part in a great perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, séeing no meane how he might quickly enioy <hi>Melissa</hi> to himselfe. Moreouer that he should in any wise speake oftentimes to <hi>Philocrista,</hi> giuing her alwaies to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the sincere and perpetuall deuotion he had vowed to her seruice, and for to be able to satisfie the same in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manner, he was by maner of recreation, gone to take a little the aire of the countrie: which the dwarfe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to accomplish in euery point, for he desired neuer to disobey him all the daies of his life in the least thing hée should command.</p>

               <p>Great was the ioy and pleasure of the Emperour that his knights had gotten the honour of the day, and hée did neuer cease to praise sufficiently, the two gallant knights of France, and the others also who had done their vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most endeuours not to let the victorie slip out of their hands: but when he arriued afterwards at his palace, and could set eye of none of these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In bréefe, when the solemnitie of the mariage was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, all the strange knights departed, euery one into his owne countrie, and soon after departed the new espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Ditreus</hi> and <hi>Esquiuela,</hi> to go for Hungarie, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many hardie knights, whom the emperour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to guard them, least peraduenture some Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish pyrat should set vpon them to take away their great riches that the Souldan of Babylon had sent them after the departure of his sonne <hi>Abenunq.</hi>

Then thanking much the Emperour (by a letter which he wrote vnto him) for the honour which hée had done his sonne, sent backe all his knights enriched with many goodly presents, which he gaue them.

So trauelled he on two daies, the second wherof he lodged in an hermitage built vpon the top of a little hill, where he tooke a poore but a ioifull refection: the morrow morning he tooke vp into a narrow way, not knowing well whether he went: and as he was a good bow-shoote from the hermitage, he disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered two knights comming a long way, which crossed ouer his, for whom he purposed to attend at the place where the waies met: recognishing <hi>Marcomyr</hi> as far off as he could discerne his shield: whereat he was the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest man in the world, hoping by force or faire meanes to bring him to Constantinople: therefore he stept out and thus saluted him.</p>
               <p>Sir knight I hold my selfe highly fauored by fortune, hauing here met with you now, who for none other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion am departed from the Emperor <hi>Cleodomyrs</hi> court, but to séeke you, and that for so much as he hath a singuler desire to vse you courteously with the kindest entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he can make you, since he saw you last in the tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.

This said, they encountred so violently, that it séemed the earth should open vnder their coursers, and breaking their lances in a thousand péeces, they went both to the ground, where <hi>Arnedes</hi> had his shield and armor pierced thorow with his aduersaries sword, (which he caried alwaies with a sharpe edge) and moreouer a wound in his breast: for al that he was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vp againe and running with a great viuacity of sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke roughly vpon him with his naked sword, fought with him couragiously a good while, making him to know what was the amitie he bore him. But by reason of the great abundance of blood which gushed out of his wound, his heart began much to faile him, by meanes whereof <hi>Marcomyr</hi> had him so much at aduantage, that in the end he gaue him a mighty blow downeright vpon his creast, wherewith he fell downe astonied in the place: which when he saw, he cared not to giue him any more, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had made cleane his sword, which was all bloodie, he put it vp into his sheath, saying: I beléeue you will haue little list to force any knight hereafter, but you will remember your paiment at this time: then remounting on horsebacke (albeit he was hurt in the encounter) hée
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:23383:62"/>
pursued his way with <hi>Ozalias,</hi> who highly commended <hi>Arnedes</hi> for an act of a right good and hardy knight, which he had séene him doe in this combat.</p>
               <p>But the Hermit who beheld the battaile, moued with charitie and compassion, made apace downe the hil to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour <hi>Arnedes</hi> who lay all along vpon the grasse, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying the strings of his helmet, he puld it off his head to know in what state he was in, whereby it fortuned that the vigor of the sun sending downe his beams perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly vpon his face, restored him in an instant &amp; made all his spirits come to him againe. Then séeing no more the knight who was conqueror in the ioust, (but an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite hard by him) he iudged him to be very courteous and humane, who would not kill him outright, being in his power so to doe: yet felt extreame paine and was in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement choller to sée himselfe so foiled and hardly vsed, not so much for his wound, as for the fortune of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie which had ben so contrarie to him, that he began to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this pittifull maner: What should I now doe, but complaine of the inconstancie of fortune? Am not I accursed to come into these countries to purchase fame and renowne, and haue as yet done no act, which doth not redound more to my shame and ignominie then to any honour and praise of Chiualrie? Ah séeing my forces will not be correspondent to the courage of my heart, and I cannot otherwise demeane my selfe more valiantly, it were better I surcease the exercise of Chiualrie, then so il to employ my selfe in the vpholding and augmentation of so noble estate.</p>
               <p>Further would he haue prosecuted the exclamation of his bad fortune, detesting the enormitie of his life, when the Hermite exhorted and comforted him in this maner: My son, thanke our Lord who hath deliuered you out of the knights hands, who hauing you at such aduauntage, hath shewed himselfe very pittifull and mercifull, in that he did not seperate your soule from your bodie. Cease I

beséech you these discourses, which cannot auaile you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then to nourish in your heart anguish and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but thinke vpon God, who in a moment can make you inuincible, and giue you all your hearts desires. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing said thus, he wrapped vp his wounds as well as hée could, thinking to conduct him more easily afterward to his Hermitage: but as the diuel would haue it (one mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance commeth seldome alone) euen as he was getting vp on horsebacke, there arriued <hi>Lechefin,</hi> who bare him a mortall grudge for the loue of <hi>Philocrista.</hi> Who knowing him well, and séeing him in so euill taking, was verie glad of his méeting, to the end to be reuenged at his good aduantage: for otherwise he had not the heart to haue met him face to face. Wherefore comming néere him, he began with this prowd and presumptuous language: I declare thée as much my capitall and disloiall enemie, as thou louest her, whom thou art not so much as worthie to serue: this much I hope I shall make thée quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse: and pay dearly for thy rashnes and too audacious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in addressing thy loue to a ladie, whose least grace of a thousand, surmounteth in merit the most braue and excellent of all French men.</p>
               <p>These words ended, he couched his lance thinking to naile him fast to the earth, which he had assuredly done if <hi>Arnedes</hi> (who saw himselfe ouertaken thus vnprouided) had not shrunke a little on the left hand, whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to play his part so nimbly that in trauersing euery way he gaue his aduersaries horse such a sound blow, that he laid them both vnder féet: by which meane hée had leisure to put his helmet on his head: for he supposed it stood him greatly vpon to defend himselfe. In the mean time <hi>Lechefin</hi> leapt vp quickly againe, sore brused with the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:23383:63"/>
with a courage almost inuincible to deliuer him manie shrewd and daungerous strokes, which did so much the more augment the féeblenes of his members, wherby hée could not long time hold out against him.</p>
               <p>The good Hermite who perceiued him loose his blood thus, put himselfe incontinent betwéene them, praying <hi>Lechefin</hi> for the honor of God to hold his hand, for that the knight of himselfe did much abridge his owne life: but <hi>Lechefin</hi> who was a Moore, and by that mean more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable, would in no waies heare him, but raging in great choller, stroke the poore Hermit such a blow vpon his head, that he claue it asunder downe to his téeth.

Saying this, he goeth courageously to charge him with thrée so strange blows, that he made him féele the last smart: neuerthelesse by reason of the blood which streamed incessantly from his wound (especially at the chafing and choller of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge) he waxed instantly so weake and féeble, that if the pitie and mercie of God had not succoured him, he had ben verily cut off by the hands of this infidell Moore.</p>
               <p>There did the soueraine dominator of this round Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, shew a most miraculous aduenture, bringing the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iust at that hower <hi>Pernedin</hi> the duke of Peraes son, one of those who had enterprised the quest of <hi>Marcomyr</hi>: who as soone as he had recognished the two combattants (all amazed to sée them two in fight together) came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them, crying out with a lowd voice: Eternall God what meaneth this?

But when the Nunnes knew he followed the Emperours court, they did him all the honour they could deuise, and one of them who was learned and wel experienced in the art of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke and Chirurgerie, tooke charge to tend him careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vntil his perfect recouerie, and there she remained some daies with him before she could recouer him to his former health.</p>

Wherefore he caused a mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning béere to be made, litter fashion, and vsed so great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that within two daies after he got him to the court: where when the Emperour had heard what was
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:23383:65"/>
befortuned him, he was highly displeased against the Moore. Of a troth quoth he, <hi>Lechefin</hi> cannot resemble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one better then the Souldan of Persia his father, who was neuer other but a receptacle and harbour offellony: and I cannot deuise who hath moued him to outrage so honest a prince as is this knight of France, then presenly he went to visit him, and gaue his Phisitions charge hée should be carefully looked vnto, and beside prouided of whatsoeuer should be necessarie for his spéedy recouery.</p>
               <p>Then began <hi>Arnedes</hi> the discourse of his encounter with <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> vpon the end whereof the Emperour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him: I maruell greatly this knight sheweth so ardent a desire to doe me seruice, and yet will conceale himselfe in this manner and flie from me? Undoubtedly he goeth to trie himselfe in the aduenture of <hi>Celestina,</hi> sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he followeth the rout you tel me, and it may be by his great Prowesse he will bring it to an end. If so it bée, God kéepe my nephew <hi>Belcarin</hi> out of his hands: herein many of the assistants were of the same opinion: and from thence forward was <hi>Lechefin</hi> estéemed of al for a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and a fellon.</p>
               <p>The Emperour returned into his chamber, and would that the Empresse should goe on the morrow to visit <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedes,</hi> which she did with a right good will accompanied with <hi>Philocrista</hi> and <hi>Melissa,</hi> to whom this mischiefe and iniurie done to the French knight greatly displeased, and pierced them to the verie heart, but to <hi>Philocrista</hi> most of al, albeit she was frée from all sinister thought, for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie which she alreadie bore him, procéeded of no other cause but of the gentility and vertue which she saw shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning most apparant in him: and moreouer there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this world, which she had in more singular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, then the kéeping of her own chastity both in thought and déed incontaminated.</p>
               <p>You may well iudge whether <hi>Arnedes</hi> were glad or not, séeing before his eies her whom he loued so ardently,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:23383:65"/>
to bée sorrowfull for his hurt, to blame <hi>Lechefin</hi> as a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and disloiall: for the sole obiect of her countenance, and the féeblenes of her spéech, did sufficiently bewray what an alteration the heat of the fatall fire had alreadie wrought in her. These foure discoursed a long time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, meane while <hi>Amenada</hi> the dwarfesse of <hi>Philocrista</hi> &amp; <hi>Risdena</hi> her nephew came to <hi>Bruquel, Arnedes</hi> dwarfe, whom they saw strangely lamenting for the mischance and disaster befalne his maister. <hi>Amenada</hi> comforted him as well as she could, telling him it was nothing, the worst was past, and none of the wounds found to be mortall, how the Emperour had sent him excellent Phisitions and Chirurgeons, who promised to set him quicklie on foot againe.</p>
               <p>Were it Gods will quoth <hi>Bruquel,</hi> it were so, and that my maister might once find the meane to sup vp the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote, which alone might corrupt and annihilate the so penetrating force of the swéet poison which was lately gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him: and then leauing this circumstance of words, he fetcht a déepe sigh almost from the ground, for hée had very short legs, and would vse no more circumelocution, but followed this point in this sort: Ah my lord <hi>Arnedes,</hi> how dearely doe you buy her beautie, for whose sake you departed out of your countries?

               <p>
                  <hi>Melissa</hi> also who desired with a singular affection to know who <hi>Recindos</hi> her louer was, hauing séene these two Myrmidons prate together, and vnderstanding some inkeling of their talke in passing by them, so soone as they were retired into their chambers, demaunded <hi>Amenada</hi> what were the matters debated betwéene her and <hi>Arne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> dwarfe. Wherevpon the dwarfesse made her a long discourse, whereof <hi>Philocrista</hi> was wonderous glad, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thereby to vnderstand something of the French prince. And as she heard say, he was departed out of his house for the loue of a Damsel, imagined this imediately meant by her selfe: for it falleth out alwaies euery one best fauours himselfe in iudgements relying vpon bare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iectures: for this cause she bid <hi>Amenada</hi> that she should cal vpon <hi>Bruquel</hi> to performe his promise. The dwarfe as soone as he had opportunitie to speake vnto his maister, made him vnderstand at length all which had past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene himselfe and the dwarfest of <hi>Philocrista</hi>: whereat he was the gladdest man in the world, and gaue him now a great charge to be carefull to bring this practise to a good end.</p>
               <p>The next day when the Emperour and <hi>Diocles</hi> dined together, <hi>Amenada</hi> went to take <hi>Bruquel</hi> in his lodging, who séeing her come, began thus to prattle aloud: madam, I haue giuen order for that I promised you the last night.

And requireth her in the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest manner he may, she would vse with some little cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie and benignitie the heart that she hath so secretly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished from him, and if in the meane time she wil employ his bodie in any other then familiar and domesticall affaires, it would please her to send backe his heart with some comfort, accepting the offer which it hath now late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made her: so shall he repute himselfe the most happie and fortunate champion, that euer entered battell in the seruice of any ladie, moreouer should find himself quicklie recouered and healed of all his wounds: otherwise should not be able to liue foure &amp; twentie howers in this world, which were a way to purchase the death of infinit others besides his, especially that of <hi>Recindos</hi> his cousin, sonne of the king of Castile, who louing him as himselfe, would néeds beare him companie in this voiage, and be partaker of the same trauels and diseases he endured, for the great amitie and néere parentage betwéene them. So cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could this Pigme file his language to second his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters intention, that it reaped that fruit to these two yong princes, as hereafter you shall heare: which might well
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:23383:67"/>
be compared in loiall and perfect amitie to the two pitha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorean companions, <hi>Orestes</hi> and <hi>Pilades,</hi> or to <hi>Nisus</hi> and <hi>Eurialus,</hi> who would die the one for the other.</p>
               <p>Greatly wondred <hi>Amenada</hi> hearing him tell how so high and illustrious a prince had thrust himselfe into so many trauels and dangers for the accomplishment of this mariage, which he might haue effected by his agents em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied therein. Then she made this answere, Assuredly if I had not promised to tell my ladie and mistresse this, I should not dare for any thing in the world aduenture my selfe to discouer or manifest so great matters as these, for I should neuer be able to shew her the one halfe, but <hi>Melissa</hi> who neuer stirreth farre from her, would vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand or presume something. It skilleth not for <hi>Melissa,</hi> quoth the dwarfe, I care not if it were done in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, for I estéeme her so modeste and sage a princesse, that she will shew her selfe rather silent to disclose it, then inconsiderate and giddie headed to reueale it to any, and I assure my selfe she will but take all the matter in good part. This spake he, to the end she should be an act or in the comedie, for the loue of <hi>Recindos:</hi> and if peraduenture <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locrista</hi> were slacke and backward in her loues, she might counsell her not to refuse this good fortune offered her: breifely they should reciprocally take aduise the one of the other, as hauing both their hearts pierced with one dart: for it falleth out many times two thoughts afflicted with like martyrdome, receiue mutually more comfort, then being with others who féele not the like torment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bruquel</hi> hauing so well done his deuoire for the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Philocrista</hi> to his maisters bow, returned inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to him, whom he found attending in great deuotion to vnderstand the euent of this amourous stratageme.

               <head>CHAP. XIX. How Rifaran after he had put himself inquest of Marcomyr, passed before a castle which appertained to the countesse of Iseland, for whom he combated a brother of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and fiue other knights, who besieged the same: and how the countesse entertained him very courteously into her castle, where he fell in loue with her at the same instant.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T gréeued greatly <hi>Rifaran</hi> to haue made eight or nine daies iourney without hearing any news of the knight whom he sought, and as he perceiued his trauell was in vain (for in troth he held a contrarie way to that <hi>Marcomyr</hi> had taken) knowing not what to resolue on, whether to returne to the court, or to goe on still to séeke his man, it chanced he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This countesse was a widdow, and had béene but two yeares without her husband, who in the end of his daies, for that he had no children, and loued his wife with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular affection, made her the inheretrix of all his estate and siegnorie: whereat was greatly wroth a brother of the earls, called <hi>Diolas,</hi> a fierce and hardy knight, who as a yonger brother, was little the better by succession of his father, but for a small farme, being al he could pretend for his part, and willingly would he haue made warre vpon his sister, had he not séene her well beloued of all her vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals. By reason whereof he feared to loose his labour, and all the time he should employ therein, thinking to get more another way, caused her daily to be sollicited and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:23383:69"/>
if she did not forsake quickly that possession shée held vniustly (surrendring it willingly into his hands) he would cast her out by force and violence: as he who next after the death of the deceased earle his brother, ought by right and reason to inherit.</p>
               <p>The countesse was in a great perplecity through these threatning spéeches, yet determined to defend her selfe, if he went about to molest her, and by good fortune the same day <hi>Rifaran</hi> came that way, when <hi>Diolas</hi> went the round without the fortresse, with fiue other knights well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to espie the féeblest part where they might scale and surprise it. The countesse thereof aduertised, presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her selfe presently vpon the battlements of the wall, where leaning ouer the top of a rampire, iust at the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall of <hi>Rifaran,</hi> she began these pittifull and sorrowful la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations: Alas why will you thus ruine me? What hath moned you to be so angrie and furious against a poor damsel, a widow, to dishonour her, to outrage her vassals and best friends, who neuer committed against you the least offence, which in any thing might exasperate the choller of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (were he neuer so malitious or mutinous) to take so austere and rigourous vengance, as you séeke to offer me? I pray you in the fauour and for the deuoire of that honest and vertuous amitie, you haue alwaies séene in me towards you, you permit me to liue in peace, suffering me to enioy without disturbance during my life, that little which it pleased him to inuest me with, by the ordinance of his last wil, &amp; I promise to render it you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly at the end of my daies: for now to depart with it, were to me a heartsgriefe vnspeakeable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diolas</hi> returned her a thousand villanous spéeches to terrifie her, saying she had empoisoned her husband, and that he would otherwise haue dispossessed her of all that she did wrongfully possesse by the law of the twelue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.

                  <hi>Rifaran</hi> who staid there to heare those alterica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions betwéene them, perceiued well what the cauill

The explorator was in a rage and ful of indignation, hearing <hi>Rifaran</hi> speake to him in this sort, who in great choller cut him of thus:</p>

from the place, and that none of them should bée so hardie as to come to his aid, whereat the countesse great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meruelled, because she knew not the knight who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke her defence. Meane while the two knights who had great desire to grapple, encountred with such courage and furie, that breaking their lances to their gauntlets, they brusht one another so puissantly with their shieldes and bodies, that <hi>Diolas</hi> was dangerously wounded in one of his shoulders, and turning bridle incontinently began to hew on another fiercely with their swords: all the time of this recharge, the countesse, who wel knew how valiant a knight her enemie was estéemed in these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, praied God deuoutly for her champion, wondering much how without great cause his heart serued him to enter this combat. But <hi>Rifaran</hi> being valerous, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect warrior, shewed within a little space, he would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carie away the victorie, for he made his fight with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous dexterity, &amp; neuer profered blow but hurt his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie: so as in lesse then halfe an hower he tamed him so well, that with a stroake which he lighted aloft on the creast of his helmet, he made him fal from his horse to the ground: Then <hi>Rifaran</hi> alighted from his, and running hastely vpon him, cut a two the laces of his helmet, and withall his head from his shoulders, saying to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse, who looked on thorow the loopeholes of the platform: Madame, now are you secure from the vexation which this peasant did worke you, so that from henceforth you néed not feare him any more.</p>
               <p>The ladie was much abashed at his suddaine spectacle, and much more affraid were <hi>Diolas</hi> fiue knights, who sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their maister alreadie dead, came like mad dogs to charge vpon <hi>Rifaran,</hi> crying to him: thou art dead, cruel and inhumane Barbarian, séeing thou hast not had pittie of a better and more courteous knight then thy selfe. Hée knowing it was time to bestir something els then his tongue, and not to be all day in doing it, put himselfe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:23383:71"/>
brauely in defence: when with the first stroake of his sword, he sent one of them to kéepe <hi>Diolas</hi> company in the other world. But the other foure held him so liuely play, that he receiued two or thrée wounds, yet not mortall nor dangerous, for he droue them so before him, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one nor other could once come néere him, but they should find him ready to receiue them. And although they gaue him his hands full, as doubtlesse the match is too vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall of foure against one, yet he neuer shewed himselfe coward or fainthearted, but in warding stil their blows, mist not their bodies an inch, at euery aduantage where they lay open, and he made the sweat drop down his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head for feare, whom he could sometimes by chance light vpon.</p>
               <p>The countesse séeing her champion in perill of death, sent many of her people to his rescue, so that there salied out of the fortresse more then twentie knights all very well armed to goe sacage and take prisoners those foure assailants: for all that, they could take but two of them al hewen and massacred of their bodies, whom they caried afterwards within the castle: for as for the others, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry feare had made to take their héeles so soone as they saw the supplie of enemies come forth of the castell to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile them. In the meane while two young knights, kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the countesse, came humbly to thanke <hi>Rifaran,</hi> and to inuite him to refresh himselfe within the fortresse, as well because it was néedfull for him to rest, as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the ladie and mistresse thereof had a great desire to know him, and to doe him all the honour she might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, for the suddaine and miraculous aid she had receiued at his hand. Gentleman quoth the knight then, smal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are these I haue now exploited, in respect of that I would endeuour to accomplish, as far as my life would goe, for her and her péeres. Notwithstanding I will goe willingly to visit her, to the end to doe her that reuerence which I ow to all the honest and vertuous paragons of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:23383:71"/>
her sex. So he walked forth towards the castle, and as he drew néere it, behold the countesse who met him, who thanking him in most humble manner for the knightly act he came from performing in the defence and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of her good right, required him most instantly and with a very amiable grace he would declare her his name, to that end her spirits might be setled, knowing him by whom she had receiued this aid.</p>
               <p>Madame quoth <hi>Rifaran,</hi> I am a gentleman of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours court, whence I am come not long since to séeke a knight who departed thence very secretly this other day: and arriuing here by chance as you may sée, I could not endure you should be thus villanously outraged by your aduersarie, against whom I haue as I thinke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all blame attempted that which euery aduised and noble knight is bound to doe in the like occurrence. With this talke they mounted vp the staires of the great hall, where being arriued, the countesse did with her owne hand disarme <hi>Rifaran,</hi> then laid him in a rich bed, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his wounds to be looked vnto with all care, giuing commaund the same euening to make an honourable tombe, to inter therein the bodie of <hi>Diolas</hi> her brother in law, with ceremonies of funerall pomps, as were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit, for the yonger brother issued of so high a house as that of Iseland. And afterward causing al her vassals to bée as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, she aduised that <hi>Rifaran</hi> and the two knights which she held prisoners should recount vnto them the discourse of this battaile, the happie issue whereof made them more then content: In respect whereof they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine sware and promised vnto her loiall fidelitie, and she remained in tranquillity and peaceable possession of her estate. So that hereby her thoughts being no more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the continuall vexations and alarmes that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olas</hi> was wont to giue her, she occupied her selfe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in tricking vp of her naturall beautie, and in doing of things which might please the knight, whom she per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued

alreadie a little entangled in her loue, which on the other side fiered her owne thereby with an vnquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble flame, hauing vnderstood he was nephew to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse of Constantinople, but she knew not he was a Moore: this reciprocall amitie grew so hot betwéene them, that it rauished quite the spirits of this countesse, euen to make her forget the chast and vndefiled lawes of her widdowhood: for the impatient desire of <hi>Rifaran,</hi> and the guerdon of his merit, whereof she was in silent manner required, did prouoke her so liuely that shée was persuaded to let her heart swim in the streame of all deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ioissance: so it fell out afterward by the subtiltie and secret practises of <hi>Cupid,</hi> wherof not any liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but they two, and one of her most faithfull ladies of honour were priuie: and <hi>Rifaran</hi> loued her afterward so strangely, that for the loue of her, fearing least his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might cause her sorrow &amp; insupportable griefe, he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourned a great while longer in that place then hée was determined to doe.</p>

But that you desire to purchase the name of a true champion of <hi>Celestina,</hi> by the meruellous exploits of armes that you do daily in garding her, by this meane making a more memorable fame of her excellence, and kindling a greater desire in al gentlemen to come to that island, to be for her aduenturers? so it séemeth to mée you are not my knight, nay by good reason you may be called <hi>Celestinaes</hi> knight, which induceth me to beléeue the words reported to me in your behalfe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you tooke your leaue of the tourney at Macedonie, were but fained and dissembled: which I must thinke to procéed of a very suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient act (if spéedily I perceiue not the contrarie) to place you in reputation of the most ingratefull and disloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all prince who euer entered into quest of Chiualrie: but least the persuasion (wherewith the popular voice hath

               <p>To returne to the prince of Tarsus, as soone as <hi>Tira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel</hi> saw him approch the bridge, he made out against him, as he did against all others who in great number re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted continually into this place, rather to combat with <hi>Belcarin</hi> then to trie themselues in the aduenture of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestina,</hi> and had alreadie vanquished six since his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons departure: whereof <hi>Marcomyr</hi> aduertised at his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the night before, resolued rather to die then to take the place of the seuenth. Wherefore he laced his helmet, then gallopping to the end of the carrier (for at the other end he beheld <hi>Tiraquel</hi> all in a readines) gaue him such a

braue encounter, that with a shrewd blow he sent him to the ground: for all that he lost one of his stirrops by the counterbuffe which he receiued of <hi>Tiraquel,</hi> who lay there a good while before he could rise againe, he felt such paine by his fall.</p>
               <p>Those who beheld this encounter meruelled much, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the Quéene of Thessalie, <hi>Celestinaes</hi> mother, who arriued there foure or fiue daies before: for that the last of the thrée Fairies who wrought the enchantme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the castle, foreséeing she could not liue longer, procured the arriuall of <hi>Marcomyr</hi> as before you haue read, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward sent the quéene word that soon after her decease she should sée all her desires accomplished.

And as soone as he had done his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, going a pace neither too swift nor too slow, he came to the gates of the second turret, which clapt together with a more horrible creaking then they were wont to doe at the comming of any other knight: for al that, he who saw them going a far of before they were quite sparred toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, pusht betwéene his sword, which he then bare naked in his hand, therefore could they not shut close together: and being nothing amated at the noise, he quickly thrust his fingers betwéene the two dores which he opened so easily, as if they had ben two leaues of paper. Quicklie was he in at them, thrust on with an vnspeakeable glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, knowing neuer any other knight had gone so far in this aduenture.

blowes, that he kept them far inough off him: albeit so sharpe and cruell did this battell séeme vnto him, that hée affirmed oftentimes afterward, he neuer saw himselfe so sore handled in any assault, where euer he had ben before nor afterward. In fine, he vsed so well the force and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie which God had giuen him, that he made them cease the fight, forcing them to recoile to the end of the bridge, from whence they vanisht out of sight, and at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant with them the knight gardian of the bridge, and the dwarfe, who neuer boudged from the watch tower, being then heard a most great and horrible earthquake in all parts round about the castel.</p>
               <p>The quéene perresuing the same, fell downe on her knées to the ground to thank God of this good beginning: as did also those who were in companie with her, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Ozalias,</hi> who being desirous to follow <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> would leape incontinently after vpon the bridge, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse could not plant one step sure, for that neither hée nor any others of the companie might passe ouer at that present, albeit many assaied to doe it, and yet tooke much paine in vaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcomyr</hi> on the other side was so ioifull he had set his foot so far, that he neuer reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred to take any rest: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he went directly to the castell, &amp; going almost round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to séeke the entrance into it, séeing the countermure and the enclosure of the wals which did enuiron the great chamber, were very high and too stéepe to be climed vp, past a little farther, where he found the posterne gate of the garden garded by two enchanted dogs, thorow which he saw (hard by a fountaine within) many Damsels stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp. Among whom she in the middest (sitting vpon a chaire wrought with imbroderie) was <hi>Celestina,</hi> so pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing faire, and most sumptuously attired, that she had not only prouoked the tender and passionate hearts of ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured knights, but also made ioifull, yea moued stones, plants, and other insensible creatures.

then hauing thus séene and curiously beheld her, as a bodie rauished and franticke, thrust from him the dore so violently without al feare, that at the third time he brake it open: and entring ioifully into the place of his blisse, the dogs ran vpon him forth with, tearing with their sharp téeth, all the plates buckles and leathers of his harnesse. Notwithstanding he who saw himself in eminent peril of life, fearing to be torne in péeces and deuoured by these beasts (which séemed to him more terrible and mad then the infernall furies) began to lay at them with downright blowes, and then thrust vpon thrust so liuely, that he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wearied himselfe then hurt them in any wise, for that his sword could not pierce their skin, being diobollically enchanted. Wherefore not well knowing what to doe in this perplexitie, he said in great brauerie, How is this? Now I am before the eies of the most excellent of all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, shall my force and stomack faile me, that I cannot defend my self against these hideous and brutish animals? Ah too great an enemie should be to me that old mortall Chimere, if she should make an end of me here before her, in whom lieth the perfection of all my future glorie. As soone as he had ended this spéech, letting his sword hang at the chaine of his arme, and taking in either hand one of these sauage and horrible beastes, he put them finely vnder his armepits, where he thratled them so hard, that they were quickly strangled: neuerthelesse he remained so wearie and senceles, that scantly could he well stand vpon his féet a good while after.</p>

               <p>The like was it with the yoong ladie, maruelling as much or more, at the beautifull forme and the wel accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished proportion of the knight, not for all that, without inwardly thanking the God of heauen to giue her such a husband: and in veritie these two louers were one of the most beatifull couples that euer man saw matched toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, woorthie to compare with <hi>Hero</hi> and <hi>Leander,</hi> those two glistering stars of their time.</p>

But small chéere serued the two vassals of the sonne of <hi>Citherea,</hi> for that they saciated themselues with looking one vpon another: for there is nothing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious to a louer, then to behold the obiect which he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth: because loue making a breach vpon the body, and planting his seat round about the heart, debarreth the passage to all nourishment, while it is fed with this amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conceit, which is such, that all you who haue tasted it, may iudge of the swéetnesse or bitternesse thereof.

How Marcomyr and Celestina going towards the queen of Thessalie who was yet at the end of the bridge, met at the issuing out of the castle many ladies and knights of that isle, who attended there for them: and how the lord of the same island after he had done great honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to them, brought them to the queen, who carried them backe to lodge within the castell, and of the sequel.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O great was the ioy of <hi>Celestina</hi> (hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her future spouse to say he was son to the Emperour <hi>Cleodomyr</hi>) that all that night no sléepe nor any desire to sléepe could enter into her head: by meane whereof she and <hi>Marcomyr</hi> past it away in deuising together what they had best to doe, and in the end laied down the plot which liked them best.</p>
               <p>After the cléere morning had chaced away the darknes of the night, and spread ouer the horison his blew and azu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mantle, to prepare a passage for her swéet louer <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> against he left his ruddy couch, they both together went into the dungeon of the castle, where <hi>Marcomyr</hi> wondred greatly at the riches and magnificence of the lodging of his lady <hi>Celestina.</hi> There would she néeds search him to sée if he were wounded in any place dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, and finding none but brusing blowes she caused him to be bathed diligently with swéet hearbs, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted with many sorts of fomentations, and to put on a rich blacke armour, which the Fairie left there expresly for him, with a sword by which he might cast a sléepe whomsoeuer he would: the helmet and lance were born by two damsels: then descending out of the tower, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing thorow the gréene garden, they came away by the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:23383:81"/>
bridge holding all hands together. <hi>Celestina</hi> was finely tricked vp with a carcakenet full of great collets set thick euery where with carbuncles, diamants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rubies, Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rawdes, and Orientall saphires, clothed in cloth of gold cunningly wrought ouer with many litle pretious stones, embossed in figures set like vnto Silenes, or little apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carie boxes, whose fashion and rare artifice surmounted far the valour of the things. In one whereof was séen so great quantitie that you would haue iudged nature had bestowed in that place the most excellent and rarest gems of her treasure. Hauing moreouer wich a fillet garnished with great pearles, quainlie attired her haire yellower then the gold-twind hanging round about adowne her shoulders, and vpon her two little apples on her breast, more to be desired then those of the garden <hi>Hesperides,</hi> thus she marched with a grace no lesse gratious then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séeming a Uirgin, who saw at her side so valiant and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimious a knight to defend them, better then any dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon could doe.</p>
               <p>As they then came forth in this pomp and ioy second to none other, they found many gentlemen and ladies of the island, who attended there for them in great deuotion, and among the rest one faire and very braue knight kin vnto the Fairies, whom they did inuest with the siegniorie of that place after their death: he bowed himselfe very low, and set one of his knées to the ground before <hi>Marcomyr</hi> and <hi>Celestina,</hi> vttering with a verie good grace these spéeches:</p>

And as she shewed (still in her going) many signes of congratulation to her louer, the knight certified her how ten or twelue daies past her officers arriued at the end of the bridge, and she her selfe the next morrow after accompanied with many Barons and ladies, whereof <hi>Marcomyr</hi> was well a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When the quéene saw her daughter come so pompeou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly attired, she was seised with so much pleasure and ioy,

that her spirits vncapable to conceiue it, she fell downe in a traunce betwéene <hi>Ozalias</hi> armes, who had almost born her companie through the content and ease suddainely stroken into his heart, séeing <hi>Marcomyr</hi> seated vpon the top of Fortunes whéele.

wherefore faire knight (whom God blesse from all mischance) séeing you haue brought into so great gladnes the soule which floated among the waues of this tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous sea of aduersity, restoring <hi>Celestina</hi> into my hands, so also I must entreat you with an affection procéeding from a heart, which shall féele it selfe for euer bounden to you, to doe so much that this ioy may be entire and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, to giue me her father as he is by the fatall destiny appointed: to the end we may liue together the rest of our old age in al tranquility of spirit.</p>
               <p>The knight had great pittie on the quéene, and quickly tooke her vp by the hand, saying: Madame, I pray you vex not your selfe any further, for I haue determined to die or to worke these matters so about, that you shall passe the rest of your old yeares with more content then of the quéene of Thessalie may be imagined. Then the good ladie thanked him, and kissing his chéeke very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously she replied thus againe: I beléeue vndoubtedly my son, you wil assuredly hold your promise, séeing our Lord hath so wel acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plished you in all things, that he doth not permit you to speak ought with your mouth but your hart is pricked with a desire ready to perform it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vttermost.</p>

By meanes whereof, they remained there thrée daies with as much pleasure and solace, as any humane spirit might wish: nor could they saciat themselues with beholding the strange things, especially those of the dongeon wherein <hi>Celestina</hi> had bene so long time enclosed: wherby it chaunsed that <hi>Marcomyr</hi> finding the seat of this isle in so good and fertile a climat, purposed to transport thither a colonie of people out of his kingdome of Tarsus, to inhabit it the better, and to the end also this countrie might immortalise the remembrance of him and of <hi>Celestina,</hi> to the future ages of his posteritie.</p>
               <p>There were they serued sumptuously, and with all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance by the siegnior of the island, but the quéen could not glut her selfe in beholding her daughter, and talking to <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> who loued her surely no lesse then her selfe did: in such manner that they two one day being both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether far in talke, he praied the quéene most louingly to conduct her daughter to Constantinople, to put her on his behalfe vnder the protection of the Emperor, whom shée should tell moreouer, that so soone as he could dispatch his voiage into Turkie, he would kisse his hand, and so acquit himselfe of that promise, which he had by the mouth of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers made vnto him diuerse times. Lord <hi>Marcomyr</hi> qd. the quéene then, I will with all my heart doe that which you prescribe me, yet would I faine know, whether you meane to goe against the Turke with a puissant armie, for as much as if the case stand so, I will send into Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salie for as many companies as you will haue, and for a néed will demaund aid at the Emperours hand, who will succour mée willingly with so many legions as I would demand.</p>
               <p>Madame replied <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> my mind is to take none other companie with me, then such as I brought hether, considering this busines shall be brought to an end, rather by aduenturous hazard, than by any forces which I may

march into the field: and were all those of the Emperour vnited together, they shall not be able to bring it so quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about. Neuertheles, sée here my resolution: You must vnderstand how I met not long since at sea with the king of Culacin son in law to the great Turke, beating vp &amp; downe the coast of Thrace, accompanied with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rouers, and a great consort of like faction, that with all his power he might endomage the Empire: I tooke him by faire war, and sent him forthwith fast bound and manacled as an arch pyrat and king of Rouers vnto the power of the Emperour. If perhaps I cannot by my car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and secret drists preuaile in mine attempts, being in that countrie, I will politickly séeke to make exchange of these two kings, vnder pretext of some good and colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable practises. In bréefe, I will worke as the occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of time and place will giue me leaue: wherein I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séech the diuine bountie to shew me the spéediest and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctest course, whereby I may quickly bring to a fortunate end this my so affectionat desire.</p>
               <p>Excéeding glad was the Quéene to heare of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of the king of Culacin, so that being put in great comfort through this hope, she hastened with al diligence the departure of <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> thinking euery day as long as a thousand yeares till she saw at libertie the king her husband: the same thought <hi>Celestina</hi> also, who with her amorous becks and signs shewed vnto her louer al the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour she could deuise, for that neuer going from her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they could not giue such contentment to their hearts as they desired in amorous talke and deuise only: &amp; more priuie habitude then kissing, had not as yet bene permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their sportings, nor did it happen at all till the day of their mariage, when <hi>Marcomyr</hi> vndid the impolluted girdle of hir virginitie, which till that day she had euer worne vntouched.</p>

But before their departure the spirits of this trinitie could not contain, but they must poure out a great streame of tears, which was so tossed by the wind of their sighes, that the storme did depriue their tongues of their office, and especially that of <hi>Celestina.</hi> Wherewith <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comyr</hi> had his heart so griped, that he could not endure to sée her in such paine, but departed without further adieu, and tooke his way with his cousin <hi>Ozalias</hi> towards the seacoast of this isle, where he had commanded his marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to attend him with his ship.

               <p>

Then being arriued at the last néere Constantinople, the quéene sent before one of her knights to aduertise the Emperour of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, who meruelling much therat, demanded the name of him who had conquested <hi>Celestina.</hi> My lord, quoth the knight, he is called <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> one of the most valiant and courteous knights who liues this day vnder the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament.

               <p>With these words she consigned vp her daughter into his hands, whom the Emperour receiued very amiably, and shewing himselfe most ioifull of their arriuall, offered them frankely all thinges which might be necessarie for the content of their spirits. Moreouer praied God he would so well direct all the actions of <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> that he might quickly set frée the king her husband out of his long captiuitie: assuring her, if the knight had ben willing to haue had forces along with him in this enterprise, he would haue aided him with a huge armie.

the rich seats of tapistrie which were in the presence, where the knights beholding these thrée ladies, thought there should be amongst them a second iudgement of the apple of beautie. And who had taken <hi>Arnedes</hi> for the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle shepheard <hi>Paris Alexander,</hi> his deare ladie <hi>Philocrista</hi> should full soone haue ben in possession of him: because loue did so sway his heart, that he found her the perfectest of al, though <hi>Celestina</hi> excelled her in some gifts of fauor: so that all the assistants concluded by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon resolution, they had neuer séen a fairer lady, except the Empresse whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she was in flower of her yong yeares. And a thing most true it was, <hi>Philocrista</hi> neuer attained to the perfection of her mothers beautie, but she had two sisters, named <hi>Fleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> and <hi>Basilia,</hi> which resembled her very much, especially <hi>Flerida,</hi> which was iudged the fairer, as you shall heare hereafter. The emperour intreated <hi>Celestina</hi> to tell him who this <hi>Marcomyr</hi> was, if she could shew him so much: whom the princesse answered very modestly, If it please your grace, I cannot giue you any thing to vnderstand of him, but this, he commaundeth a kingdome and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seigmories of very great estate, and when I should know of him more, yet were I to be excused though I did not discouer so much (for it is his pleasure to conceale it) till he come himselfe in person to manifest his countrie and his progenie.</p>
               <p>For this modest answer was <hi>Celestina</hi> greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended of the emperour, who iudged her to be very wise and well aduised, when he began to behold héedfully her gestures: so that spieng on her finger the ring which her louer gaue her to keepe in testimonie of his seruice, he dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it presently to be much like that whereof the quéene of Tarsus made him a present at his departure from her. Therefore he could not chuse but demaund her in what place she had recouered so rare a ring, and so néere resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling one which he estéemed the fairest of his Cabinet.

                  <hi>Alderine</hi> was ouercome with ioy at so good an answer, and as she was recounting it to the Quéene <hi>Griana,</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Tiraquels</hi> post, he doing his message to <hi>Belcarin,</hi> made him very heauie with the newes: for that he would faine haue then ben present in the guard of the bridge to haue tride himselfe against this so redoubted a knight: albeit it fell out better for him: for although he was of all men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for valiant and skilfull in Armes, yet his valor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer could come so high as to make compare with that of <hi>Marcomyr.</hi>

Then the knights appearing within the listes, set vpon the one side of the pallace, when the signe was giuen, they ran with such a tempest one at another, that their lances flying in péeces, they fell both downe to the ground: neuertheles both of them being quick and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they were with a trice vp againe: So they began to strike at one another without all pittie, and desiring both to be victors, they burst and beat asunder their armour on their backes as in open war at all defiance: so that they were both wounded in diuers parts of their bodies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:23383:90"/>Therefore the king and the other lookers on, maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to sée them so obstinate in their fight, said they neuer saw so much magnanimity in any two knights before: wherevpon the king supposed that <hi>Belcarins</hi> aduersarie was the very same who had deliuered <hi>Celestina</hi> out of the enchanted isle: for reputing his nephew a most braue and hardie man at armes, he saw him then in great danger of his person.

Then he went strait to the damsel (who was the ioifullest in her heart that might be, séeing her enemie <hi>Belcarin</hi> in such an ill taking, for of a troth was neuer knight brought into so low an extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) and began thus to tempt her: Faire gentlewoman I pray you let me entreat you not to cause the death of two so valiant champions as those are, and I beséech you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>Belcarin</hi> (for my sake) if he hath in ought offended you, for I hope he shall make you such amends, and doe that

penuance which you shall please to put him vnto: and for my part I promise to shew you such courtesie, as you shal one day haue occasion to thanke me for that it was my hap to moue you therein.</p>
               <p>To that will I neuer consent while I liue (qd. the damsel) for I had rather sée <hi>Belcarin</hi> die presently before my eyes, then to haue the monarchie of the thrée parts of the world vnder my power, considering the hainous and detestable treason whereby he hath so villanously abused my father, and all his posteritie: and lesse will I euer absolue my knight of the promise which he hath made me. The king entreated her once more with great instancie, and so did likewise all those who did accompanie him: neuertheles it was all in vaine, for she was so fixed in her most deadly grudge, that she tooke no pleasure in any thing, but in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerating the hainousnesse of the case.</p>
               <p>When the quéene (who felt her selfe in a great agonie through the perill wherein she saw <hi>Belcarin</hi> was) vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the refusall of this damsell vpon the truce and accord of the two knights, she herselfe went to speake to her with the duches of Pontus, and the princesse <hi>Alderine</hi> her daughter, entreating altogether that she would acquite <hi>Recindos</hi> of his promise, and the quéene would retain her for one of the ladies of honour of her house. But all those entreatings auailed no more then those of the king, to mooue that inexorable damsell to pittie, whom when the quéene saw her so full of mutinie and crueltie, she swore in great anger, vnlesse she would pardon quickely both the knights, she would make her die a shamefull death, for there was a murmuring before, that the accusation layd against <hi>Belcarin,</hi> was false and malicious. The Damsell hearing the quéene speake in so great a rage, was greatly affeard, and had also some compassion on the tears which she saw stream incessantly downe faire <hi>Alderins</hi> chéeks, so that alighting from her palfrey, she prostrated her selfe at the quéens <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Orican</hi> was the Turkish mariners name, who hauing told his mother of the great fauour that the knight whom he conducted had done him, returned aboord presently, praying <hi>Marcomyr</hi> to come a shore to refresh himselfe a little in their house, which he willingly did, being wearie and annoied with the pestred aire of the ship: after that he had equipped himselfe with his rich blacke armor which the Fairies left him in the castell of Carderie, and with the sword which had force to enchant and cast in sléepe whomsoeuer he would, by vnsheathing it: It was a large one, and short like a cemitorie, but grauen very artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and guilded, garnished beside with thrée sorts of ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, whereof she sheath was made of the one, the hilts and the pommell of another, and the handell of a most rare and pretious Calamite that might be found, the blade of most pure and fine stéele, and the best temper that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer giuen to a sword: in briefe it was iudged the rarest péece of worke that euer was séen in that kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oricans</hi> mother receiued <hi>Marcomyr</hi> and <hi>Ozalias</hi> with the greatest entertainement and welcome she could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, and in the euening came home the old fisherman who was very glad to sée his sonne whom he accounted forlost and forlorne: notwithstanding he was much abashed to sée what companie he had gotten and made to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore, to entertaine them after marriners manner in so poore a house as his. And as he began to aske of his wife whence procéeded this good fortune, <hi>Marcomyr</hi> demanded of him from what part he came, whervnto the good man answered him very courteously: from a cittie sir, not far distant, whether I went this morning to sell some fish, which I made away quickly, because there is assembled a great number of knights to be present at the mariage of the daughter of the lord thereof, whom he marieth to the sonne of the captaine of Albase: &amp; there
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:23383:93"/>
I staid some what the longer, to the end to sée the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome and a sister of his which he brought with him who is estéemed the most beautifull and the finest yong Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of all the round world. The which is of very many great lords demanded in mariage, but she will not accept of any, saying that she wil neuer marie with any but with him, who shall deserue her by his Prowesse and dexterity of armes: so that many braue and valiant knights are come to sée her for this intent, and haue ordained vpon the third day of the feast, a triumph for the loue of her, who in the mean space goeth so pompously attired, that she draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into great admiration all those who looke vpon her: &amp; I tell you sir, there is such a concourse of people, that it séemeth to be the court of the great turke with his bassoes and Ianissaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcomyr</hi> who listened to him most attentiuely, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned some little while pensiue, and afterward bethought himselfe, if he might but once by his subtil deuises enamor this Damsell, he might easily at his pleasure enter into the castell of Albase, where he should haue better meane to set abroch his statagems <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The morrow morning <hi>Marcomyr</hi> made the fisherman know he would be one at the triumph, by reason whereof he bestowed something on him in gift, praying him to haue in speciall regard his ship and mariners: then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted accompanied with <hi>Ozalias</hi> and <hi>Orican,</hi> who was his guide and did him much seruice in his practises about this busines. They were not far gone before they met by the way one of <hi>Leifidaes</hi> pages (so was the Damsels name who was daughter to the lieutenant of Albase, for whom they should Ioust) who was sent from his mistres to goe sée a sister of hers maried there néere at hand, lying
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:23383:93"/>
then in childbed. <hi>Marcomyr</hi> comming towards him, gaue him a courteous and affable salutation, &amp; demanded of him if the triumph were held the next day following. Yea ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily quoth the yong youth, at least they haue all so agréed, and if you come thether you shal find many hardy knights within the palissadoe: but I beléeue the partakers of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polo</hi> (so is the name of the bridegrome) wil cary away the honor of the tourney, because many hardie and valiant champions are come to this feast for the loue of <hi>Lefida</hi> his sister my mistresse, and to the end to find better meane to present him their seruice, would take his brothers part being one of the chiefest in the triumph.</p>
               <p>Then the prince recalling in mind the perfections of his <hi>Celestina,</hi> breathed forth a déepe fetcht sigh, and on the other side was maruelous glad to haue met with the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of this damsell: wherefore by this meane to win his acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he procéeded thus with him. Gentleman I may déeme the excellent graces of your mistresse to bée so amiable, that in an instant they will captiue and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap those who doe behold it, but I can well assure you, there is one readie with his entire will and most sincere affection to serue her, who neuer yet appeared before her face: which I speake for my selfe, who abandoning the place of my natiuitie, haue trauersed (wish almost insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable trauell) many and diuers countries, to come he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make her vnderstand the extreame deuotion I haue to be her perpetuall and faithfull seruant. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto only the renowne of her excellent beautie, which I thinke hath pierced thorow the whole circuit of the earth, hath induced me. And séeing my good hap is so fauorable at this present as to méet you so fitly, albeit you know mée not yet, and that I haue towards you merited nothing, I would neuerthelesse of fauor entreat one thing of you, which you should doe for me: by the effect whereof beside you shall purchase notable reputation of courtesie and gentlenes, which all noble borne of your age ought to

haue in singular recommendation, I hope to make you know it is no ingratefull person whom you shall gratifie with such a pleasure, and that you should not repent to make me your debter in a far greater good turne. What would you haue me to doe, quoth the yong man? For as much as you séeme to me vertuous and a man at arms (if it be to me a thing possible and honorable) I will doe my best indeuor willingly.</p>
               <p>Thanks for your good will replied <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> &amp; know that I would obtaine of you nothing else, but if it would please you to tell your mistresse, a strange knight who commeth into this country but to sée her graces and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, commendeth himselfe most humby to her good grace, and praieth her with a most inward affectionate loue that she would accept him for her knight in the tourney: with intention to shew himselfe second to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>The page séeing <hi>Marcomyr</hi> beautifull, and richly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, déemed that he must néeds be some great personage, wherefore he framed this answer thus to him modestly: Sir, I should not dare to enterprise this for any man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, without some acquaintance before, or knowing that he had some familiaritie with my mistresse: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, estéeming it a thing of small consequence, and that you deserue more fauor at my hands then this, I will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly carrie her this message, for your sake who entreat me with such instance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Marcomyr</hi> thanked him againe, and to make him more beholding to him, that he might

beare well in mind this businesse, caused his Squiers to giue him something for a present, which well contented the messenger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and deuising together of many other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they came at last to <hi>Prissa</hi> (so was the cittie of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the bridegroome called.) They found there, all a large plaine couered quite ouer with pauillions: where <hi>Marcomyr</hi> chose out for himselfe a place which liked him best, commaunding to erect there a rich and faire tent.</p>
               <p>In the meane time the young man tooke honestly his leaue, and entred full glad into the citie, where was heard of euery side great triumph and magnificence, for that was the first day of the mariage. <hi>Leifida</hi> had no sooner spied him, but she asked what newes from her sister? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto he answered, that he left her making good cheare, and praying him to present her humble commendations to all those whom she knew would be glad to receiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. When he saw her withdraw her selfe late in the euening into her cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber (knowing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or neuer was the fitest time to deliuer his other message) he followed her at an inch for the same purpose, &amp; taking her aside a litle fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hir damsels, as though he would haue imparted some secret to her fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hir sister, he made the whole discourse vnto her as <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr</hi> had informed him. I cannot bethink me qd. she then, who may this knight be who hath ben so hardy as to send me these presumptuous messages, being he saith he is a stranger, &amp; that he hath for my loue abandoned his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try. In sooth nor I, qd. y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of this can I wel ensure you, he sheweth himself descended of great pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, &amp; is one of the most beautiful &amp; fairest personages that I euer saw in my life. As for his courtesie and liberality, behold here (in shewing her the earnest of their deathes, albeit nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them thought thereof) what largesse he hath vsed, causing to be deliuered me by his Squiers these rich pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents which he hath giuen me.</p>
               <p>Truly I wonder much replied the Damsell, that this

knight commeth from so far a countrie to sée me, well might I be reputed very ingratefull (whosoeuer he be) if I did not thinke well of his so great trauell. Therefore faile not to shew me him to morrow, so soone as hée shall enter within the lists, to the end I may marke well his doings.</p>
               <p>Most willingly will I doe your commaund, answered then the yoong man, and I can better then any other sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie you, for I know him very well by the rich armes which he beareth, and by a goodly courser vpon which ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday he was mounted. So did the page begin the train which came to end in the damsels braine, who (after that she had set it on fire her selfe) felt such a burning all that night, that she could not sléepe any winke: thinking and imagining still who might this knight be that came so far from a strange countrie to sée her.</p>

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:23383:95"/>
Then assembled the knights together which were for both parties, about two thousand, all men of cheife, and very braue champions, and being entred within the bars, euery one began to shew his prowesie and dexteritie: but because the number of valerous champions was far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the bridegroomes part then on the contrarie side, they fetcht about the aduersaries so well, that they had borne away the price of the battel, if <hi>Marcomyr</hi> and <hi>Oza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> had not come into the bickering: who knowing this kind of skirmish a little better then those of that Region, made themselues known what maner of men they were by the trial that they made of them, especially <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> who emploied himselfe in such maruellous déeds of arms, that before the page sayd any thing, <hi>Leifida</hi> knew him by his incomparable exploits, whereof she and all the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers on, were in a great woonder: because if hee shocked fiercely, yet he knew better to manage and voltidge his horse, so well, that there was no knight who durst stand before him, so that at last being thorowly heated, as a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger following his prey, he chased all his enemies to the retreit. Then séeing the tourney ended to his honour, hée returned into his tent with <hi>Ozalias,</hi> who had behaued himselfe also for his part very valiantly, but they did not disarm themselues till night, mistrusting least they would séeke to lay some ambuscado for them: as happeneth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in such sports and pastimes, when the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed being prouoked with malice and enuie, conspire to lay rods in pisse against the vanquishers.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Ripolo</hi> perceiued his people were put to foile and vanquished, he was very angrie in his stomacke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he loued affectionatly <hi>Leifida</hi> his sister, and doubted least she would impute the fault to procéed from him: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding she had not her heart vpon any other thing but on the knight to whom the honor of this victorie was truly due, commending him to the heauens for his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable addresse and magnanimitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:23383:96"/>Faine would she haue vnderstood the whole processe of his historie, and knowing no better mean, tooke to her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side her Embassador of the day before, whom she setteth thus aworke: vnspeakeable séemeth to me the generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this strange gentleman, who knew full well how to put in effect the resolution, whereof he sent me word yesternight by you, for which you must néedes goe thanke him from me, and also for the great trauel and pain which he hath sustained, to come for mysake thus far: moreouer as he hath in ample sort shewed me his force and prowesse in armes, tell him that I desire no lesse to sée his person being disarmed: Wherein to satisfie me, (if he will be this euening at the banket with my brother who is new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly espoused) he shall doe me this pleasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I wil not faile to account in the number of the kindest which I may receiue from him.</p>
               <p>The yong man went to dispatch this message. In the meane time while they did couer in the great chamber, al their talke was of nothing else but of the great prowesse of the knight who had won the Tourney, and that which drew the people into more admiration was that no bodie knew him, not <hi>Ripolo</hi> himselfe, who would very faine haue knowne the certaintie what he might be, but none could giue him any certaine newes. At the last <hi>Leifidaes</hi> page being come to <hi>Marcomyrs</hi> tent, deliuered him his message in wise manner, whereof the knight was merue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous well apaid, and returned him this answer. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I pray you certifie your mistresse from me, that I would not for any thing disobey her commaundement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no other thing in the world forced me to come so far from mine owne countrie, but an extreame desire I had to present vnto her my humble seruice, reputing my selfe most happie if she will but employ me in any thing which may be pleasurable vnto her. To goe sup with the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, it séemeth to me a thing a little repugnant to the small acquaintaunce which I haue as yet with him, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:23383:96"/>
with those of his companie: neuertheles I thinke verily to be there soone after supper, to the end mine eies may take their full repast at the obiect of the celestiall visage and comely grace of your mistresse, beséeching you in all deare affection, that you doe not make knowne to any who I am. And if peraduenture I may speake a little in secret with her, I shall tell her thinges which shall make her liue in ioifull content all the rest of her life. Wherein if you will be a third agent, loiall, and fauorable, to bée a meane of her good and your owne, I will return you such recompence that you shall call a hundred and a hundred times happy the hower, wherein through appointment of the destinies you met me by the way: for albeit you sée me now alone, and in this simple equippage of a knight errant, I possesse neuertheles great wealth, rich prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and great state. Sir, answered the messenger, I will employ willingly my person, to doe you all the seruice I may deuise in things which shal not empaire mine honor, nor that of my mistresse: and I will take beside very good order that you shall not be knowne of any but of hir who desireth extreamely to come to that point. Then <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr</hi> disarmed himselfe, and cast a Turkish gowne about him, carying vnder it his sword only, &amp; came along with the yong man into the great chamber wher the feast was kept: there standing in a corner, where he might sée and be séene of <hi>Leifida,</hi> began to eie her with none other then a demure, smiling, and fained looke, to the end thereby to worke a cautelous meane to deliuer thence ere long the king of Thessalie.</p>
               <p>And whilst he plaied his counterfeit pageant very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly, the page went vnto <hi>Leifida</hi> his mistresse, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her softly in her eare: Sée yonder madam the knight vanquisher of the Tourney, who praieth you in all deare loue, you will not disclose him to any of this countrie, whether he directed his voiage, onely to sée if your beauty and excellent graces did second your renowne which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sounded

into his eares, euen into his owne countries, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping if it be so, (for he hath alreadie opened to me the most secret gate of his heart) so to employ himselfe in matters of all difficultie to come by your acquaintance, that you shall haue none other occasion but to loue him, at the least to thinke your selfe much beholding to him for the trauell you your selfe shall sée him take for the same effect. The rest that hée told mee, I will recount it you at leasure in a place that may séeme fit to make vnto you so long a discourse.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Marcomyr</hi> neuer departed from the place, till euery bodie almost was retired, and his long tarying there sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not to be in vaine, assuring himselfe it would returne some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

by and by into her chamber, who calling aside to her the messenger of her loue, she began thus: Ah page, most true are the words thou didst tell me of the knights beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whose comely gesture and séemely grauitie (if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not my selfe too much) with his prowes and valor in armes, make me déeme him the flower of the best accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished gentlemen that I euer yet beheld: Madame, said the young counsellor, if you will sée many perfections in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused into one bodie, I beséech you speake vnto him as soon as you may, and let not slip out of your hands the happie and inestimable good which the destinies haue sent you hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fatally: wherein his eloquent and fluent tongue shall witnes sufficiently the rest of his vertues, whereof you shall find your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elfe so well satisfied, as he may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that thing at your hand, which you can well denie him. How can I speake vnto him, quoth <hi>Leifida</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out incurring blame, and wronging mine honor which I haue hitherto carefully preserued, if it be not by your meane in some secret place, whether he may be brought, to take away all suspition from people, who are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies so prompt and readie to make the very innocents examples of their mallice? I will tell you quoth the yong man: you remember that my lord your father praied you the other day to returne to him as spéedily as you might possiblie: that will serue you in stéed of a good occasion to take your honest leaue of this companie, and if you will depart too morrow in the late of the day, you shall goe to bed to my mothers house, whether I will goe before you with the knights, to entreat her to say: they be her two ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews who come thether oftentimes to visit her. So may you at your discretion deuise and parly together. You say well replied <hi>Leifida,</hi> neuertheles you must looke you be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry discréet herein, least our deuise be discouered.</p>
               <p>This plot being taken and concluded vpon for good, the yong man went the morrow morning to be with <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr</hi> at his vprising, and hauing made him a glad ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with

this newes, they mounted incontinent on horsebacke to get betimes to his mothers house, being seated in a verie pleasant place, iust in the halfe way betwéene Tubanta and the castell of Albase, néere which streamed a fresh ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, whose bankes were planted with many goodly trées, whereof al that countrie therabout was abundant, which appertained to the father of <hi>Leifida</hi> who was lord therof: when the good gentlewoman saw the two cousins she was greatly abashed, but her son had aduertised quickly how she was to behaue her selfe in that businesse, and well might she call such knights her nephewes, béeing that she was a stranger, and of a country farre distant from this place.</p>
               <p>The mother hauing had her sons instruction, how to gouerne her selfe herein, said only this one word: God grant this busines come to a good end. Doubt you not thereof mother, quoth the guide, but it will succéed euen as you and we would wish, for this gentleman is one of the honest and best gouerned knights that I euer saw in my life, <hi>Marcomyr</hi> and <hi>Ozalias</hi> liked maruellous well the situation of this place, where they tarried alone with the good gentlewoman of the house, for that the messenger was gone backe to his mistresse, who made such diligence to depart that the new maried couple could not get her to stay a day nor an hower longer, for she thought the time so long before she was with him, for whom her heart felt so extreame passion, that by no mean he could be remoued out of her fantasie: Therefore taking her congie of al the companie, she would take along with her but foure of her Damsels and two of her fathers squiers.

They are quoth she, two of my nephewes, who come oftentimes to visit me, to know if I néed any thing that they may doe for me, and likewise to present their seruice to my lord your father, if he may please to employ them.</p>
               <p>They are very welcome quoth the Damsell, and for my part I thanke them with all my heart for the good wil they beare to my lord and father: by means whereof and of the néere affinitie betwéene them and you, I shall loue them no lesse, then mine owne proper brethren and kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Then <hi>Marcomyr</hi> bowing himself towards her with a lowly reuerence, thanked her courteously for the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable offer she made him, and so entring into further talke <hi>Leifida</hi> could not hold her eies off him, his séemely counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, good grace, and naturall beautie did rauish her so much, that from thence forward the liuely portraiture of his face was so far imprinted in her thoughts, that she did inherite nothing else thereby but an excessiue loue, which by this occasion did increase daily more and more in her.</p>
               <p>Whilest they were in treatie of their amours, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman commaunded to spread the table amidst a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant tuft of trées, which was hard by the castle, wher <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fida</hi> did eat very little, by reason of the soueraigne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure which she toke indeuising with the knight: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards séeing they were both by themselues alone (because <hi>Ozalias</hi> and their hostesse were walked together abroad, and the rest went to supper presently after) the Damsell bespake him in this manner: Sir knight, I maruell very much at one thing in my selfe, that I being neuer moued for the loue of many braue gentlemen, who haue hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore oft times offered me their seruice, I féele now for you (whom I haue séen but these two daies) my hart so woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

These words did he vtter with a maruellous grace because of the ioy and gladnes which had seised his heart, séeing the cariage of his busines come to so good passe as he could desire: and the damsel on the other side she found her selfe so much rauished with his loue, that she could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer glut her eies in surueying his beauty, and lesse for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake his companie, so that constrained at last to go to bed, could not sléepe of all the night but a little, all sléepe being driuen away by plurality of amorous discourses swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in her fansie, which had before gotten so much the vpper hand of her spirit, that incontinent they put away all other imaginations from her. With the rigour of this scourge did <hi>Leifida</hi> féele her selfe most gréeuously plagued: a far diuerse torment to that of <hi>Marcomyr</hi> who sought but by his dissimulation to worke in short time the recouerie of the good king of Thessalie: so that he past almost all that night in conferring with <hi>Ozalias</hi> about his sleights and stratagems which he was to worke for that effect: Praying him of all deare loue (being entred once into the castle) to shew himselfe hardy and valerous, putting all those who came before him to the edge of the sword, so soon as euer he should heare him giue the word of assault.</p>
               <p>The morrow morning being come, <hi>Leifida</hi> attired her selfe very richly, and before she did depart, tooke her walke thorow the delectable enclosures of her lodging, with the two knights alarmed, except their helmets, who praied her agood to take them both with her to Albase: to the end they might haue better and more honest mean to present themselues before the captaine of the castell, to whom they desired so extreamly to doe seruice. <hi>Leifida</hi> thanked them very gratiously, and said her father should be right glad of their comming: then mounting alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Presently were the draw-bridges pulled vp, the gates well barred as they were wont, and the princes were caried into the hall, where <hi>Marcomyr</hi> vewed euery place exactly, and thinking euery hower a thousand years before he were at the skirmish in so sure a place, thanked God who had so well and prosperously conducted him thether.</p>

Hée is then quoth the father, very welcome hether, &amp; in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his good will, he shal haue the best cheare we may prouide for him.</p>
               <p>For all that his purpose was otherwise, because the more his daughter commended them, the more angry was he to see them within the castle, their very presence striking into him a feare and suspition: neuertheles to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble it, and not to let them perceiue therof, he procéeded thus with a pleasant countenance: daughter goe you in to salute your mother, &amp; in the meane time these knights well disarme them. This he spake, meaning to cause their armes to be lockt vp, and kept safe from them till they were out of the castell. But <hi>Marcomyr</hi> who heard those spéeches, doubting some such euent, cared not much to talke with him any further, but went strait away with the page of <hi>Leifida,</hi> who brought him vp into a very faire chamber, where in stéed of disarming themselues, they caused their squiers who carried their armes alwaies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them to lace their helmets quickly, then betaking
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:23383:102"/>
them to their shields with vnconquerable courage, they salied out hauing their naked swords ready drawn in their hands. Which the yong man séeing, (was more amased then if at the same instant he had lost his forme by some new metamorphosis) began to crie out in strange maner: O detestable and vile act of disloialtie, running downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to aduertise the gard, wherein he was soone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented: for <hi>Marcomyr</hi> knowing he might not delay his enterprise any longer, made spéedily down into the court, where he saw the captain blaming and rebuking the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for letting him in, who made their excuse vpon <hi>Leifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> that brought him in with her. And perceiuing him to make furiously against him, he cried alarme, O my loiall and faithfull knights take armes, slay me these vilaines who are come to betray vs in this rash manner: then the prince (hauing instructed <hi>Ozalias</hi> before to win the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket and kéepe it against all those that would come in to succour or goe forth to flie) remembring his lady <hi>Celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> that he must either die in the place, or deliuer the king her father out of prison began to strike without pity those of the gard: the captaine séeing his honor and life redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to so pitiful an exigent, laid suddainly hold on a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This constrained the knight (who would not haue stroke him otherwise, for the loue of his daughter) to strike againe, so that he gaue the old man such an ataint with a blow returned to his head that he cleft his skull downe to his iawes, giuing the like entertainment to thrée or foure other knights who let driue at him, thinking to massacker him quickly: but in a small space he made so cruell a slaughter of al those which came to encounter him, that the most hardie and valiant remained in the place either dead or dangerously woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And if peraduenture any coward made to the gate,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:23383:103"/>
thinking to get out that waies to saue himselfe by flight, he fell into <hi>Ozalias</hi> hands, who shewed them but small courtesie: so that in this skirmish there remained not one man of the castle aliue, except the page which was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the ship that brought the two cousins into this good hauen: who ran imediatly to his mistres <hi>Leifida</hi> telling her thus.

When the Damsell and her mother heard these piteous tidings, they ranne forth almost out of their wits not knowing what to do, &amp; séeing this horrible discomfiture, they bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to wring their hands and poure forth the most pitifull complaints that euer any liuing person heard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leifida</hi> who accused her selfe of all this blame, fell downe halfe dead vpon her fathers corpes, vttering a spéech in this sence: Alas deare father, pardon me who am the only cause of your death, which séeing I haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced innocently thorow the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Tell me Barbarian, what moued thée to render this sorrowfull recompence for the extreame loue I bare thée, now conuerted into all deadly hatred, and more then mortall malice? How durst thou deceiue a poore maiden thus trecherously, considering the great familiarity into which I so soone admitted thée at the first sight? Ha dissembler, that hast thus surprised me through the false apparence of thy faire and sugred words, saying thou wert a king, a prince, a great siegnior, I thinke it wel, but of théeues and murderers, who camst hether but to pillage the treasure in this place. O foolish &amp; more then miserable girle, to credit so lightly thy cogging and deceitfull persuasion: whose issue is but too tragicall and full of calamity. Surely if all those who knew me e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue reputed me a sage and an obedient daughter, now they shall from henceforth account me for the most disloiall and wickeddest maiden that liues, hauing thus wrought the death of mine owne father. And although it be against my will, shall I for that cease to exclaim of the inconstancie of fortune, which by the only report of, I know not what cloked and friuolous ostentation, hath so easily chaunged my heart: What will you my lord the great Turke say, when you shall vnderstand the tidings of this massaker, which hath ben so cautelously wrought to steale hence your treasor? Alas why doe I not call to mind the aduersitie and dommages that your brother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the Emperor of Constantinople, when hée tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled the world as a knight errant, I should féele no more the perplexitie which this too suddaine confidence that I reposed in this stranger driues me into: but what!

               <p>This was the tragicomicall act that <hi>Marcomyr</hi> began to play at Prissa &amp; continued at Albase, where the Casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and his gards of the castle, finished miserablie their liues. Hauing then dispatcht them all, they made search in all corners of the castle to find out the prison wherein the king was enclosed: at the last they found him locked vp fast within a tower, whose windowes were all yron bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, so leane and poore that he made them almost agast to behold him. <hi>Marcomyr</hi> who séeing him in this pittifull ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, remembring how he was father to his deare ladie <hi>Celestina,</hi> could not chuse but wéepe for compassion.

Therefore most willingly preparing himselfe to the sacrifice, he cried out alowd: Redéemer of humane nature, I commend vnto thée the poore soule which must presently passe out of his vile prison, vouchsafe then pittiful father to accept the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels and miseries that I haue so long time patiently suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for pennance of my sins: and séeing he hath knowne my bodie vnworthie of his protection in this world, bée to him a mediatour for my soule in his celestiall kingdome, to the end his Iudgement may not banish it, from the place of eternall felicitie, which he hath promised to the blessed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcomyr</hi> being stricken dumbe at this lamentable spéech, <hi>Ozalias</hi> began to speake thus vnto the king: let not your maiestie feare that we are come to wrong you, but to deliuer you out of this sufferance, and to bring you to Constantinople, where you shall find your Quéene with <hi>Celestina</hi> your onely daughter (by whose meane you are presently set at libertie) who attendeth there for you in all deuotion.

Some ran like mad men among the trées, thinking she had hidden her selfe vnder the thick bowes: and finding her in no part, they began to pull off their beards, teare their haire, strike themselues on the breasts as hard as they might with their fistes, calling oftentimes for death which was their last refuge: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was no way of escape for them, if the Turke were once aduertised of this misaduenture: to be briefe in this pittifull spectacle was there séen nothing but tragical actions.</p>
               <p>Thus did these poore desolate men remaine and could not tell what were best for them to doe: for none of them durst carrie these sorrowfull newes to the Turke: till at the last some going one way and some another, all scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themselues and neuer would returne vnto the court afterward, leauing behind them, the heauie and woefull damsels of <hi>Marencida</hi> bewailing the losse of their Ladie and mistresse in that infortunate place.

               <p>He had good hope to vnderstand some good news of him, because the enchaunted bird had that day presaged many signes of gladnes: Therefore demanded what tidings he brought. Sir, quoth the knight, I am the affectionate ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> him whose renowne alreadie hath so much resounded into your ears, who next after you (the péereles paragon of chiualrie) is estéemed to be the best by triall and touch: he sendeth me in al humblenes to beséech you that you will entertaine the king of Thessaly, whom he bringeth backfro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Turkie, with such honor as his worth requireth: assuring you they cannot be far from the hauen by this time, for they were entering the mouth thereof, when the pilots began to strike their sails and to cast their ankers as fast as they could.</p>

If it please your maiestie. qd. he, this hath beene one of the most admirable aduentures you euer heard talke of, and fortune hath ben so prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and fauorable to him, that he hath not only deliuered
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:23383:110"/>
the king of Thessalie, but he bringeth with him moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a very fair ladie which is daughter to the great Turk. Of this was the Emperor more astonished, when he praied <hi>Ozalias</hi> to tell him by what meane he had conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the damsell: which when the knight had very quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recounted him, he went to put on his robes, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Diocles</hi> and all the other Nobles of his court to doe the like. At the last <hi>Ozalias</hi> withdrew himselfe a little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his cousins louer, to tell her the newes which shée longed so faine to heare of a certaintie: but she who had ben aduertised of all thinges before by one of her pages, came hand in hand with her mother towards him, being both lifted into so suddaine ioy, that they therewith sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med both rauished of their senses. The Quéene embraced him not without apparant token of great amitie, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him if <hi>Marcomyr</hi> were néere at hand, and whether he brought in his company the king her husband: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he answered, they might wel be both in the hauen, and it will not be long before they arriue in the pallace, for they are here expected.</p>
               <p>By the helpe of God I shall goe méet them, quoth the Quéen, for I cannot remain so long idle vntil they come: saying thus she tooke her way with <hi>Celestina</hi> and all her damsels, as quickly as they could set forward, so that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comyr</hi> (who was in the forecastle of the ship with the king beholding the godly cittie) knew them as farre off as he could diserue them. For the ardent desire wherewith hée loued <hi>Celestina,</hi> did administer probable coniectures to his iudgement therefore he said thus to the king, my lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold without doubt the Quéene and your daughter, who as far as I can sée now, could not tarie for our comming. I request you let vs goe on shore to entertaine them, and let vs not make the time long, which they thought to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, taking the paine to come so far to méet vs. So presently they went both on land, for the great desire they had both to be néere her, whose remembrance could

neuer out of their minds, by no distance of place which might depriue them of their presence.</p>
               <p>So that the Quéene who scantly knew the king her husband (so much did his long grisely haire, and his beard grown out of fashion mishape him) méeting him at aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thus bespake him: fair lord are you that king of Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salie for whom this wofull heart of mine hath endured so much sorrow? I beséech you tell me quickly and hold not her long in suspence, who now knoweth you not, being so much changed as you are. Madame answered the king, I maruell not if you misknow me now, considering the lapse of time that your eies haue discontinued their office vpon me, the which surely the integrity of loue hath made it séeme far longer to vs both, albeit the accustomable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolution of yeares doth neuer augment nor diminish his natural course one onely minut: notwithstanding I am the same king your husband who haue felt more passions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But séeing the immortall God doth me this fauor to sée you yet once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, before this passible bodie abandon my soule (the most affectionat desire that it had during my tribulation) let mortal <hi>Atropos</hi> come now when she pleaseth: Assuring you I shall not féele the stinging prick of his dart if she fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorise me neuer so little betwéene your arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When this spéech was done, they embraced one another by the middles, remaining a good while in one anothers arms so fast, that none might behold them without sheading some tears of compassion: in the mean while <hi>Celestina</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>Marcomyr</hi> with so many amourous cherishings, that the ease and content she receiued in her hart did make the superficies of her chéekes, and all the rest of her visible parts very good witnesses thereof.

               <p>Great was the gladnesse of the king, seeing a damsell so beautiful and well nurtured being his daughter, whom he held long time in his arms before he could let her go, taking both of them such pleasure in this recognisance, and naturall homage of father and daughter, that with simple reiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the meane time the Emperour had commaunded two hacknies and a palfrie richly harnessed to be brought to the hauen, and would by all means go thither himselfe with all his barons: by means whereof, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then went the king to bow himselfe before the Emperour, who imbraced him in most amiable manner, saying: My déere brother let vs praise our soueraigne Lord God, who hath deliuered you from out of the hands of our common enemie, wherein if I be now a most ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man for your recouerie, I receiued no lesse displeasure and grée<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherein me thinketh to veryfie the renowne that is daily spread abroad of you, you ought to take pittie at mine aduersitie, and rather to lament and be sorrie for it, then to glory and mocke as I sée you doe: considering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant fortune is so fickle and variable that she turneth her smiling and fauourable countenance at euery winke of an eie.</p>
               <p>This I say not to induce you to gratifie or honour mée the more in your court, because death were far more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to me then any life, such as I alreadie endure: wherefore I require you againe (if request I must néeds make to such an aduersarie) to aduise hereafter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue your reputation so, that I purchase no blame which may offend mine honour, and you shall doe much as well for my sorrowfull consolation, as for the increase of your owne praise. When she had vttered these spéeches, the princesse began to complaine in such strange maner, that the emperour himselfe did pittie her, and could not chuse but answer her thus: I vnderstand very well what you say, and I know better that feminine choller which now enrageth your spirit, making you transgresse the limits of good manners and modestie: not being ignoraunt how the puissance of princes is lesse then nothing, when God doth resist and stand against them: wherevpon we must make our full resolution, that we cannot doe any good act but according to his will, by the which I was carried as it pleased him into the Gransiegniors your vncles court, and I sweare and protest before him to whome all things are knowne (I will not otherwise be saued at the end of my daies) if I slue him, or euer thought to doe it, hauing then intoo too fresh memorie the honour which a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I receiued of him: this indéed, I depriued him of the damsell which he detained by force, to put her againe into

his hands, to whome by right she appertained: wherein in mine opinion, I committed none offence, séeing he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly withheld her, profaning the sacred lawes of royall equitie. And for that the sage and wise alwaies take in good part as well aduerse as prosperous fortune, I assure my selfe madame, you shall haue no more cause to be sorie hereafter, when you shall vnderstand you were conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the most courteous and braue knight who liues at this day vnder the stars, <hi>Marcomyr</hi> by name, the very same who vanquished in Hellespont king <hi>Ocurites</hi> your husband. O thrise accursed that I am (exclaimed the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell then) whose rauisher, who hath shut me in here by the means of an inexorable gut of sea, caused the imprisonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the king my déere husband: Now should I assuredly hasten on the last hower of my life, séeing that hauing him in my countrie, where by a cruell and shamefull death I might haue bene reuenged of him easily, I knew not hée was the rouer and pyrat who betraied my husband. O Fortune how dooest thou in all things shew thy selfe too much mine enemie, bringing me into such perplexity that I cannot giue my self the mortal attaint, to send my soule out of this gulfe of affliction, in which I féele my selfe so déepely plunged, that I sée no better remedie to get out, then to launch my selfe cruelly vpon the dart of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable <hi>A tropos.</hi> Surely thou art so spightful against me that I can haue no hope by praiers to mooue thy mercie, but may say iustly, the heauen hath bene far better aspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted towards me then thou prosperous or fauourable: and so it is better I resolue to indure patiently my mishaps, séeing all things crosse me so, that I cannot in them find the least sparke of fauour.</p>
               <p>The end of these words brought downe such aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of tears from <hi>Marencidaes</hi> eyes, and so great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of sighs began to rise from her heauie heart, that shée remained a long while resembling nothing but some mad sencelesse creature, filling the aire with such lamentable

Surely far more then any humane tongue is able to expresse: for the vnspeakeable ioy wherewith I féele my heart ouercome, surpasseth the capacitie of the most eloquent and learned clarke who euer for this effect might put pen to paper.

So great was the ease and pleasure of those who vnderstood this good newes, that all the night they could not sléepe nor take any rest, for that some made bonefires, others sounded trumpets, and many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments for ioy and gladnes, in briefe he did not thinke himselfe the son of a good mother who did not welcome <hi>Marcomyr</hi> as the Emperors sonne: or who did not shew some signe of reioicing at that vnexpected parentage: but all this was nothing in respect of that which the Emperor did on the morrow morning, who sent one of the richest and most sumptuous presents to <hi>Marcomyr</hi> and <hi>Ozalias,</hi> that euery one might easily discerne common loue from that which is naturall: wherein <hi>Ozalias</hi> shewed himselfe not too much pleased, for no other cause but to sée <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr</hi> thorowly resolued to become a Christian, presaging alreadie in his heart what would befall the Quéene his aunt, when she should be aduertised of that miserie: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles <hi>Marcomyr</hi> comforted him in the most amiable sort he might, assuring him to crowne him king of Tarsus, where he might lead a ioifull life with his faire <hi>Marenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da:</hi> which assuaged his miscontented mind a little.</p>
               <p>And if the Emperor did giue rich presents vnto <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr,</hi> the Empresse sent no lesse to <hi>Celestina,</hi> some whereof were presently bestowed vpon her person, which was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be adorned to goe to the ceremonie of the baptisme of hir loue <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> who should be affianced to hir present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after: for this occasion did all the Barons and knights of the court mount on horsebacke, who did much more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to <hi>Marcomyr,</hi> then before when they knew not his descent.

                  <hi>Diocles</hi> maruelling all these knights and French Nobles did so much honor and reuerence to the prince <hi>Arnedes,</hi> imagined presently he must néeds be their kings son.

               <p>My lord answered the Duke, he is our prince and soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne siegnior, who through the ardent desire which hée had to offer his seruice to the Emperor your father, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to come vnknowne into this court, and to remaine here, dissembling his person till he might sée the things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed by him to come to so good issue as he desired: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I hope according to the embassage, which the king his father hath committed to our charge to set some good and happie end, with the helpe of him whom I pray to send vs so good successe that we be not therein made frustrate of our attempt. In good faith quoth <hi>Diocles,</hi> turning himselfe towards the French prince, I haue great cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of you <hi>Arnedes,</hi> who haue hid your self so long time from me: for although you had resolued in comming he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not to discouer your selfe to any person, me thinketh

There <hi>Arnedes</hi> interrupted him &amp; said, Ah?

to find <hi>Recindos</hi> there, to whom he came to bring the newes of his brothers death, and how all the Barons and the common people of Castilia did most willingly accept him for their liege soueraign, after the decease of the king his father. Of this newes was the Frenchman very glad on the one side, séeing his cousin <hi>Recindos</hi> (whom he loued as himselfe) inheritor of the scepter of Castilia: but very sorrie because he heard no newes of him. Neuerthelesse assuring <hi>Arnedes</hi> that he did hope shortly for his returne, put him out of fantasie of going any further to séeke for him: for that quoth he, very hardly will he faile to bée at the tourney held at my mariage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the which I haue purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to publishe thorowout all the marches and frontiers, bounding this empire of Gréece.</p>
               <p>But the Emperor who had knowledge before of some that made hast before him to the court, concerning the busines of prince <hi>Arnedes,</hi> when he saw him enter into the presence with his son <hi>Diocles,</hi> he rose vp from his state to embrace him, saying: What meanes this siegnior <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedes,</hi> you would so cunningly dissemble your state with vs, we could neuer perceiue your cariage therein, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vs thereby to commit a great discourtesie, in not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring you according to your merit?

                  <hi>Arnedes</hi> who saw the passage opened, by which he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to conduct his soule into rest, and by none other but by him who had the true key thereof, felt himselfe almost ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished with ioy, whentaking the Emperor by the hand to kisse it in signe of thanks, went on thus: wel may I now vaunt my selfe to attaine the perfect fruition of al worldly blisse, séeing I am by you offered so honorable alliance, for which I cannot returne you so many thankes (to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite my self therby of the obligation wherin I am yours bounden) but I shall find my selfe still more and more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to you in a new bond which shall bind me in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this kindnes.

               <p>The Emperor meruellous ioifull to heare him profer these honest speeches, knew very well with what arrow he was wounded, and that which moued him to come and seeke in his court the balme and perfect cure of his wound: therefore he caused him to sit downe by him, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated him many other matters, whereat the Emperour maruelled not a little, especially when he vnderstood the historie of his cousin <hi>Recindos.</hi> Of this was <hi>Melisla</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad, for shée loued the Spanish Prince most ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
