         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no man that can plead igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the universall Decree of God concerning the necessitie of Mans mortalitie: <hi>It is appointed for all men once to die:</hi> and every man can say as that wise woman of <hi>Tekoaeh, wee are all as water spilt upon the ground.</hi> There is no Age, Estate, Condition or ranke of men, but have beene foyled with that invincible Champion death; who ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up and downe the world upon his pale Horse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove these five thousand yeares, hath with an impartiall stroke laid all flat before him: some in their Infancie have proved what it is to die before they knew what it was to live; others in the strength of Youth; some in their Old age: rich and poore, high and low, of all sorts; young men may die, old men must die; even those that are stiled Gods (and that by no fawning Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophant, but by God himselfe) their mortality proves them to be men to themselves, though they be as Gods to others: and as <hi>Epictitus</hi> once told the Emperour, <hi>That to be borne, and to dye was common both to Prince and Beggar.</hi> The sicknesses and miseries of this world have made the proudest <hi>Painims</hi> to confesse with St. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Cornelius, Even I my selfe also am a mortall man:</hi> so that experience (as well as Scripture) concludes, <hi>what man is he that liveth and shall not see death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14764:3"/>
There are no ingredients in the shop of Nature that are sufficiently cordiall to fortifie the heart against this King of terrors or his harbingers: the velvet slipper cannot fence the foote from the gout, nor the gold ring the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from a fellon; the richest Diademe cannot quit the head-ach, nor the purple Robe prevent a Fever: Beauty, strength, riches, honour, friends, nor any, nor all can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale that sentence, <hi>Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt returne.</hi> Every fitt of an ague, and every distemper of this fraile constitution being as a light skirmish before the maine battell of death, wherein weake man being vanquished, is led captive to his long home: and when once the lines of mortalitie are drawne upon the face of the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest mortall, hee becomes a ghastly spectacle (how love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly soever before) and the conclusion is, <hi>bury my dead out of my sight.</hi> This inevitable necessitie, however it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and acknowledged of all; yet lamentable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth that in the Christian world most men so live as though they should never die, and at length they so die as though they should never live againe, and when the time of their dissolution commeth, their soules are rather chased out by violence, then yeelded to God in obedience.</p>
            <p>Indeed to a wicked man death is the <hi>beginning of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,</hi> it is a trap-dore to let him downe to the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting dungeon of Hell; but the children of God (though they cannot scape the stroke, yet) they are freed from the sting of death, they can play upon the hole of this aspe without danger, and welcome the grimmest approch of this Gyant with a smile, being freed from the hurt of him, by <hi>Him</hi> that is the <hi>Captaine of the Lords Hoste, who hath abolished death, and brought life and immortalitie to light;</hi> so that the sting of it being plucked out, and the suffering san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by Christ, death is become to every beleever but a <hi>darke entry</hi> to the glorious Pallace of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as it is Gods tender mercy to his children, that
<pb facs="tcp:14764:3"/>
their conflict and misery should be temporary, but their perfect happines eternall; so it should be their care in this little space of time alotted them, (whereupon their everlasting condition depends) so to provide that they may live happily where they shall live eternally: and since we cannot escape death, to prepare for it, that we may get the sight of this Basiliske before it approach; and so avoid the danger of it. Wretched is the estate of that man, who when these spirituall <hi>Philistims</hi> (the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of death) make warre upon him, shall have just cause to say, <hi>The Lord is departed from me:</hi> the death of such a one will bee like the sleepe of a franticke man, who when the malignant humour is concocted, awakes in a greater rage then he lay downe; whereas to him that is wise to consider his latter end, death is no way dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; death may kill him, but it cannot hurt him; it doth free him from temporary misery, but cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from eternall felicity: and as that noble Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>Thebes,</hi> who having gotten the victory over his enemies, but withall, received his mortall wound, he made this his grand enquirie, <hi>whether his weapons were safe or no? whether his buckler was not in his enemies hands?</hi> and when it was replied all was safe, he died with a great deale of cheerefulnes and fortitude. So when a Christian is to grapple with death, his maine care is that his Buckler of <hi>faith,</hi> and the helme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> of his <hi>salvation,</hi> his <hi>hope,</hi> that they be safe to guard his soule, and then he passeth not much what becomes of his outward man, hee dies in peace and confidence.</p>
            <p>Now that wee may bee fitted to encounter with this last enemy (besides the manifold helps which God hath reached to us in his word, in the passages of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in the frequent examples of mortalitie before us continually, and in our owne sensible approaches to the gates of death; I say, besides these and infinite more,) this ensuing Volume (with so much care and paines
<pb facs="tcp:14764:4"/>
compiled) by Gods blessing, and our endeavours, may prove no small furtherance in our Pilgrimage; <hi>Each Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon therein being as a severall Legacie bequeathed by those, upon the occasion of whose deaths they were preached as by so many Testators, who themselves have made a reall experiment of mortality, and left these for our instruction that survive them.</hi> It is true the dayly examples of mortaltie are so many reall Lectures, that by a kinde of dumbe oratorie perswade us to expect our end, but as they are transient, so our thoughts of them vanish, therefore it can bee no small ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ntage to have in continuall readines that which may furnish us abundantly with meditations in this kind.</p>
            <p>It was a custome in former times for men to make their sepulchres in their gardens, to mind them of death in the midst of the pleasures of this life. This present worke may not unfitly be tearmed a Garden, wherein whosoever takes a dayly walke, may gather in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall beds thereof those wholsome flowers and hearbs, which being distilled by serious meditation, will prove water of life to a fainting spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in some hee shall finde instruction, in some incitation, in others consolation, in all profit. Here thou shalt finde that <hi>Lethall gourd</hi> sprung up by <hi>Adam</hi> his transgression, that makes all his posterity cry out, <hi>There is death in the Pot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There thou mayst gather hearbs of grace, as a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-poyson against the malignity of death: in a third there is the spirituall <hi>Heliotro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ium</hi> opening with joy to the Sunne of righteousnesse, the hope of a blessed resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Doe the glittering shewes of outward things make thee begin to over-fancie them? heere thou shalt finde how little they will availe in death: the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof will make them like that precious stone which being put into the mouth of a dead man loseth it's vertue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are thou over-burthened with afflictions? here thou art supported in the expectation of <hi>a farre more exceeding weight of glory:</hi> art thou ready to faint under thy

            <p>Certainely, there is no man can sleight and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value so deserving a Worke, but hee shall discover himselfe either to be ignorant, or idle, or ill affected; especially when so judicious and learned men have thought it a fit concomitant for their severall labours, which they have added for the accomplishment of it: Therfore take it in good worth, improve it for the good of thy soule; that being armed and prepared for death when it shall approach; thou mayst have no more to doe but to die, and mayst end thy dayes in a stedfast assurance, <hi>That thy sinnes shall be blotted out when the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of the</hi> LORD.</p>

The Pharisees were a people that hardned their owne hearts, and scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed at every thing that Christ delivered: therefore now in this Chapter, hee commeth to summon and warne them to appeare before God, the great Master of the world, to <hi>give an account of their stewardship;</hi> that by the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Gods proceeding in the day of judgement, they might know the better how to prize the remission of sinnes in the day of grace; This hee doth, by presenting to them a Parable, of a certaine <hi>rich man,</hi> that had <hi>a steward who was accused unto him, that hee had wasted his goods,</hi> calleth him to an <hi>account:</hi> and to the end that the Pharisees might not thinke that it was a matter to be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted withall, and that such considerations as these were to be slighted; hee telleth them, how the <hi>unjust steward</hi> having receiued this summons and warning from his Master, that hee must come to a reckoning, hee forthwith for his owne temporall good, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth about that hee may the better be fitted to give up his <hi>account:</hi>

                  <p>Of the Persons: in the first verse. A Rich man, and his ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>Of the proceeding, in the second verse, the Rich man, upon the information made against his <hi>steward</hi> that hee had <hi>wasted his goods,</hi> calleth him to an <hi>account. Give an account of thy stewardship, for thou maist bee no longer steward.</hi> The steward (in the third and fourth verses) upon this summons falleth first to consult, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to resolve, as wee shall see afterward.</p>
                  <p>In this verse then that I have read, you see here is first the Summons or warning. <hi>Give an account.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the reason of that Summons, <hi>for thou mayest bee no longer Steward.</hi> The day is ended, now <hi>give an account</hi> of thy worke, thou must goe out of thy office, <hi>now give an account</hi> how thou hast behaved thy selfe in thy office: thou must be no longer steward, therefore <hi>give an account of thy stewardship.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the first, the Summons and calling of this <hi>Steward</hi> to an <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi> yee have cleerely offered to yee these two propositions, Considerations, or Conclusions.</p>
                  <p>First; That every man in the world is Gods steward. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Propos.</hi> 1. Every man in the world is Gods Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly; That every one of Gods stewards must bee brought to a reckoning.</p>
                  <p>First (I say) <hi>Every man in the world is Gods steward.</hi> If yee aske me who it is that is here called a <hi>Steward?</hi> The text tels yee, that it is he that <hi>must give an account</hi> to his Master.</p>
                  <p>If you aske me who is the Master? It is God. If then God be the Master, and if every man must <hi>give an account</hi> and reckoning to God, then every man is the <hi>Steward</hi> here intended in this Text. That every man must give a reckoning to God, it appeareth 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 10. Wee must all appeare before the judgement seat of Christ, to give an account of the things wee have done in this life, whether they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14764:10"/>
bee good or evill.</hi> All men: That which is here expressed by the Apostle in plaine termes, <hi>All men.</hi> Is more parrabollically and obscurely expressed by Christ in this word <hi>Steward. Give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thy stewardship.</hi> So that the <hi>Conclusion</hi> remaineth cleare, and is directly gathered from the text. <hi>That every man in the world is Gods steward.</hi> There is no man or woman in the world, but in some respect or other, is the <hi>steward</hi> here, that must be called to an <note place="margin">Proved.</note> 
                     <hi>account.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That every man is a <hi>Steward,</hi> will appeare if wee consider two things.</p>
                  <p>First, what every man receiveth from God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what God expects from every man.</p>
                  <p>Man receiveth from God, that which a Steward doth from his Lord.</p>
                  <p>God expects from every man, that which a Lord expects from his Steward.</p>
                  <p>First (I say) man receiveth from God that which a steward <note place="margin">1. By what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth from God.</note> doth from his Master: That is, such goods, such abilities, as whereby hee may be of use for such a place, as the Master shall set him in the familie. All the world is but Gods great familie, all the fittings and endowments of men, are the talents, the gifts, that God hath intrusted men with: some have the gifts of the world, riches, and places of authoritie, these are gifts committed to those kind of <hi>stewards:</hi> Others have the gifts of the body, as health and strength, their senses, and lives, and the like: these are gifts committed to these kind of <hi>stewards:</hi> others have the gifts of the mind, understanding, and wisdome, and policie: and to all these some have spirituall graces. According as men are furnished with these gifts, and according to their severall qualifications with these endowments, they all receive them from God as <hi>stewards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly: if wee consider what God expects from men: he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects <note place="margin">2. By what God expects from every one.</note> that which a Lord doth from his Steward.</p>
                  <p>First, that they acknowledge him to be the chiefe, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they hold all from him, that they have it not from themselves or for themselves, this is that which every Master ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects from him to whom hee committeth his treasure: And this would God have all men doe. God speakes that truly that <hi>Benha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi> spake proudly, and falsly to the King of Israel: <hi>thy silver is mine, and thy gold is mine, and thy daughters and wives are mine, and thy vineyards and thy orchards are mine.</hi> So may God say truly, All are his, <hi>the Earth</hi> (saith <hi>David) is the Lords and the fulnesse thereof.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal 24. 1.</note> Hee is the great possessiour of all things.</p>
                  <p>God (as hee possesseth all things) so hee letteth out parcels of his possessions to the sonnes of men. To some a larger portion of the earth then to others, yet they are but Tenants at will;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14764:11"/>
and Tenants upon certaine conditions and reservations, wherein <note place="margin">m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>n doe not waste his goods.</note> this great Lord bindeth those that hold any thing of him.</p>
                  <p>And the first Condition, or reservation that hee ties all his <hi>stewards</hi> unto is this, that they waste not his goods, that they scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them not abroad vainly or unprofitably. Now a man that hath riches, if hee releeveth not the poore: a man that hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and helpeth not the oppressed; a man that hath wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and instructeth not the ignorant. In a word, A man that hath any abilities, if hee be not of use unto others with it, this man scattererh his Masters goods, and is like that <hi>unprofitable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that hid his Talent in a napkin,</hi> and therefore was <hi>bound hand and foot, and cast into utter darknesse.</hi> This was the accusation that was brought against this <hi>steward</hi> here, that <hi>hee had wasted the goods of his Lord,</hi> that is, that hee had spent them vainly, he was no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his Master, there came no profit to the houshold by it. That's the first.</p>
                  <p>The second thing that this great Lord expects of all his <hi>ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> is, that as they doe not scatter his goods, nor vainly waste <note place="margin">2. That they doe not abuse them to ill ends.</note> them, so that they should not abuse them to ill ends. There are a generation of men in the world that fight against God with his owne weapons, and that use all their strength, and wisdome and power, to maintaine a faction of rebellion against him: that side with the wicked of the world against his lawes and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and this is the greatest unthankfulnesse that can bee. If a king should raise a servant to honour, and bestow offices and dignities upon him, and yet if hee should raise an Armie against him, and set himselfe against all his lawes, what greater unthankfulnesse? what greater enmitie? therefore it was the speech of that parra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall King in the 19. <hi>Luke</hi> (which is Christ the king of the Church) <hi>these mine enemies that would not that I should reigne over</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 19. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>them, bring them hither, and slay them before mee.</hi> Such is the state of all those men that have wealth and abuse it, <hi>consume it upon their lusts,</hi> (as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speakes) upon their pride, in excesse in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, <note place="margin">Iames 4. 3.</note> meates, &amp;c. that have wit, and spend it like <hi>Turtullus</hi> to crie downe the wayes of God, to harden themselves and others in the course of sin: that have greatnesse and authoritie, and mis-imploy it to the crushing of good persons, and good causes: these and the like are <hi>stewards</hi> that abuse their Masters goods, mis-imploy them to his dishonour, these Christ counteth his enemies, and hee will not beare it.</p>
                  <p>There is a third thing that God expects of all his <hi>stewards,</hi> and <note place="margin">3. To doe him Homage.</note> that is this, that they should doe him Homage, that they should appeare at his Court dayes. Gods Sabbaths are Gods Court dayes, wherein hee calleth and assembleth his servants together. Hee will have every one to waite there upon him, that they may
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14764:11"/>
know his will: as <hi>Cornelius</hi> bringeth his familie together, and saith he, <hi>Wee are all present to heare what is commanded thee of God.</hi> So God <note place="margin">Acts 10. 33.</note> (I say) will have his servants present at his Court dayes: and not only so, not only to be present there, to heare his will, and to understand his mind, but to submit to his orders, to yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his lawes, to be governed by his rules. God hath certaine rules to which hee will have every man subject, there be rules for Magistrates, for Ministers, for Masters, for Parents, for servants, for children, for all: and hee is a rebell, and carrieth not himselfe as Gods <hi>steward,</hi> that doth not keepe the rules that God hath set up in his owne house.</p>
                  <p>Againe fourthly. God expects this from all his stewards, that <note place="margin">3. To returne him fruit.</note> whensoever hee sendeth his Bayliffs for rent, that they returne him the fruit of his owne ground. Every soule is Gods ground, from which God expects some fruit or other, and hee sends his Bayliffs, his servants, continually to gather these fruits from men. When hee sends a poore man to the rich, there's a Bayliffe sent to him, to gather some fruit of his wealth. When hee sends an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed man to those that are in authoritie, there's a Bayliffe sent to him, to gather the fruit of his power and greatnesse. When he sends an ignorant man to those that have wisedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, there's a Bayliffe sent to him, to gather the fruit of his knowledge. And so wee may say of all things whatsoever: whatsoever indowments of body, or mind, or estate, any man hath, if another need it, that other is Gods Bayliffe, sent to him to call for his rent, to call for the fruit of his ground, and thou must returne it by such a one, for thou art but a <hi>steward:</hi> and you know how fearfull, the proceedings of the great King was in the 21. Matt. <hi>Hee sent his servants to the husbandmen,</hi> to those to whom <note place="margin">Matt. 21. 33.</note> hee had let out his ground, to receive the fruits of it, and there was none; what was the issue of it? <hi>Hee was full of wrath: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth upon the husbandmen and slew them.</hi> So when God shall send the poore to thee for reliefe, and thou helpest him not: shall send the ignorant to thee for instruction, and thou informest him not: shall send any one to thee that may have use of thy gifts and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and thou doest not imploy them that way, thou deniest the great Lord the fruit of his owne ground, and art of the number of those husband-men that must expect this at his hands to bee slaine in his wrath.</p>
                  <p>Yee see the point opened, that all men are Gods <hi>stewards,</hi> both in respect of what God hath bestowed on them, and what God doth expect from them.</p>
                  <p>I come briefly now to make some use of this.</p>
                  <p>Are all men Gods <hi>stewards?</hi> Then certainely there is some <note place="margin">Vse.</note> worke required of every man in the world by vertue of this title
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14764:12"/>
put upon him, that hee is Gods <hi>steward.</hi> It concernes therefore Every one to looke to his place.</p>
                  <p>There are two things required of every <hi>steward.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Two things required of a Steward.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First a dispensation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a right ordering of his dispensations.</p>
                  <p>First a Dispensation. For a <hi>steward</hi> yee know is appointed for laying out, hee is made for others, not for himselfe, for the good <note place="margin">1. Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> of the familie in which hee is set, not for his owne benefit. God hath made every creature to bee for the use of others, and not for it selfe: those heavenly bodies. the Sunne, and Moone, and Stars, their motion and influences are for us, for the service of the world: the Earth with the fruits of it; the Beasts, and all are for the service of man. So every man in his severall place, hath some worke to doe for others, some abilities given him for the service of others. Hence it is that the Magistrate is said to bee <hi>the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom 1. 3. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>minister of God for the peoples good.</hi> Hence it is that Ministers are said to be <hi>the servants of the Churches.</hi> I am <hi>a debtour</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) to the Iew, and to the Gentiles,</hi> to the <hi>Greekes, and to the Barbarians.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 14. 1 Tim. 5. 8.</note> Hence it is, that a Master of a familie is said to bee <hi>worse then an infidell,</hi> if hee provide not for those of his owne house. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very other Christian (though hee stand not in these relations to others) hee hath some gifts or other, that are to bee layed forth for the use and advantage of others, and every private person in the world, hee may be of some use or other in the place in which hee is set. Hence it is that the name of <hi>Brother</hi> is common to all Christians, and yee know <hi>Ioseph</hi> acknowledged that hee was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to those honours, and that authoritie and place, for the good of his brethren, for his fathers house: so should all Gods people acknowledge other Christians their brethren, and that whatsoeuer parts they have, they have them for the good of the familie. Hence it is that Christians are called <hi>members</hi> one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Every member is of use to the whole bodie, so must every Christian bee of use to another, to some by the riches of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to some by the riches of the mind, to some by the abilities of their estates, every one according to the treasure hee is intrusted with, and the Talent that is committed to him.</p>
                  <p>This is the first thing, that men must make conscience to doe, to be dispencers of their goodnesse, of any thing they have, to bee communicative, to defuse and extend themselves to others, as occasion shall bee offered. And indeed where there is any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in a man hee will expresse it this way, by doing all the good to others he can.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is required of a <hi>steward,</hi> that hee consider of the <note place="margin">2. Right orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> manner, and right ordering of his dispensations.</p>
                  <p>There be two rules for that.<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14764:12"/> That hee dispense<list>
                        <item>faithfully.</item>
                        <item>wisely.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who (saith the Lord in that 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 42.) is a <hi>faithfull and wise steward, whom his Lord shall make ruler over his houshold,</hi> &amp;c. Gods <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 42.</note> 
                     <hi>stewards</hi> yee see must in their dispensations bee faithfull and wise.</p>
                  <p>First, they must be faithfull.</p>
                  <p>Fidelitie appeares in this, when they have a right End, and a <note place="margin">1. Faithfully.</note> right rule to walke by.</p>
                  <p>What is the End and rule of a faithfull <hi>steward</hi> in all his dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations in the house of his Master?</p>
                  <p>His Masters credit, and his Masters will. His masters honour, and his Masters command.</p>
                  <p>So it must be in the house of God. If wee would bee faithfull in our places, let Gods glory be our end, and his Word our rule. That is, let a man consider, what God in his Word commands him in such a place, in such a qualification, having such indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, such parts, such abilities, and let him dispense these by that rule, according to that command, to the glory of God that gave them him. Thus was <hi>Moses</hi> a faithfull <hi>steward, faithfull as a servant in all the house of God,</hi> so the Apostle saith of him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 5. His <note place="margin">Heb 3. 5.</note> Masters glory was his end, and therefore when once hee saw his Master dishonoured by <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> hee could not then containe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but his <hi>Anger waxed hot,</hi> though <hi>hee was the meekest man upon</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>earth.</hi> And his Masters will was his rule, therefore hee came downe from the mountaine with the Tables in his hand, that it might appeare what he made his guide, and direction in all his cariage amongst the people: and wee shall find that in all the doubts of the people, either in matter of Command or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hee alwayes sought direction from God. Hee is no faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full servant that doth not doe this.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. As hee must be a faithfull <hi>steward</hi> in dispensing, so <note place="margin">2. Wisely.</note> hee must be wise in his dispensing too.</p>
                  <p>What is the wisdome of Gods <hi>stewards?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not the wisdome drawne from the writings of <hi>Machivile,</hi> or the wisdome of the World, or of the flesh, <hi>for that is enmitie against</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> God, not drawne from the rules that politicians walke by: But that wisdome that is drawne out of the Scriptures, the word of God: <hi>The word of God</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>is able to make the man of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>God wise to salvation:</hi> this is the wisedome that Gods servants must expresse, and manifest in dispensing of their gifts, they must be made wise by the Word, they must seeke wisedome from the Word the rule of Wisedome, from the Examples in the Word, of those that were guided by the spirit of Wisedome, if they would be wise <hi>stewards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:14764:13"/>
They must compare the precepts of the Word, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 19.</note> of the Saints together: see what God commandeth in such a place, in such a condition, see what Gods servants that are gone before have done in such a condition. Marke how <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> and others of Gods Saints have imployed their wealth and authority, it was for the releeving of the poore, for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods glory, for the ease of those that were opprest: Marke how <hi>Nehemiah</hi> bestirred himselfe for the sanctifying of the Sabbath, for the furtherance of Gods worship: Marke againe how S. <hi>Paul,</hi> as a Minister watched against the wolves, and how hee spends himselfe to the uttermost for the Church of God. Marke how <hi>Abraham</hi> as a master of a familie, governed his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, <hi>teaching and commanding his children and his houshold to walke in the way of the Lord:</hi> Marke how other of Gods servants have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their gifts; As <hi>Sampson,</hi> all his strength for the Church: and so <hi>Solomon,</hi> all his wisedome, and whatsoever gift any of them had, they acknowledged that the talents that were committed to them, were for God, and for the service of his Church, for the furtherance of his glory in the particular places that hee had set them in. I say if men would be wise <hi>stewards</hi> they must doe thus. But I cannot stand upon this, lest I bee prevented in that which I most intend in that that followeth.</p>
                  <p>Yee have heard who is the <hi>Steward:</hi> It is Every one that hath received any abilitie from God to doe him seruice; God expects that he should imploy that abilitie in his service.</p>
                  <p>Wee come now in the second place to consider the reckoning which every man must make, the account that every man must give of his stewardship. And that (as yee haue heard) is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point of Doctrine that offers it selfe to us out of the first part of the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> That all Gods stewards must give a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one time or other unto God. <note place="margin">Propos. 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>As every man in the world is Gods steward, so every steward <note place="margin">All Gods stewards must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</note> must give an account.</p>
                  <p>In opening of this I will shew yee two things.</p>
                  <p>First, I will shew yee what time of Reckoning God hath with his <hi>stewards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, I will shew yee why God judiciously proceedeth in this manner, called a reckoning or an account.</p>
                  <p>For the first. There are two times of reckoning that God will <note place="margin">Two dayes of reckoning.</note> have with his stewards.</p>
                  <p>The first in this life.</p>
                  <p>The second after death.</p>
                  <p>First, hee calleth them to account in this life, while they live <note place="margin">1. In this life.</note> on the earth, and that two wayes;<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14764:13"/> By his<list>

                  <p>First by his Word, hastning every man to an Account by the Gospell, and the Doctrine of repentance. This course God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe tooke with <hi>Adam</hi> called him to account for his cariage in the garden: <note place="margin">By the Word.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>And because there are many, that like the Adder, stop their <note place="margin">By the Rod.</note> eares at the voyce of the Charmer; and if God speake but in his Word they passe it by, as <hi>Elihu</hi> in <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>God speakes once, yea</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iob 33. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>twice, yet man perceiveth it not,</hi> therefore when the Word doth not prevaile, God calleth them to a reckoning by his rodde. <hi>Micha</hi> 6. <note place="margin">Mic. 6. 9.</note> 9. <hi>Heare the Rodde, and him that appointeth it,</hi> that is: God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed scourges and afflictions for men, to awake them to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the voyce that calleth them to a reckoning.</p>
                  <p>Now afflictions are outward or inward, corporall or spirituall. God sometimes calleth men to an account by corporall afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>Hee smiteth man</hi> (as he saith) <hi>with paines upon his bed,</hi> and <hi>the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iob 33. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>multitude of his bones with strong paines.</hi> What's the reason of this, but that man may come to this conclusion with himselfe, that hee may bring his owne heart to a reckoning for his former cariage? This is that the Apostle saith, <hi>for this cause many are weake and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11 30.</note> 
                     <hi>among you, and many sleepe:</hi> some were taken with sicknesse, upon others there was a consuming weaknesse, and others were strucken with death, what is the end that God propounds in all this? For this reason, <hi>that wee should judge our selves, for if wee judge our selves, wee shall not be judged of the Lord, but when wee are judged, wee are chastned of the Lord, that wee should not bee condemned of the world.</hi> As if hee should say; God now calleth you to a reckoning in this life, to the end you may prevent that heavy and grievous one that comes after this life.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus God in this life calleth men to a reckoning, sometimes by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>That there is such a Iudgement to come it appeareth; By the <list>

                  <p>Frst (I say) in respect of God, there is a necessitie of it. That <note place="margin">1. In respect of God his decree. Acts 17. 31. Isa. 46. 10.</note> his Decree may bee fulfilled and executed. <hi>Hee hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in righteousnesse. And his counsell shall stand, and hee will doe all his pleasure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is necessarie, that Gods honour may be vindicated. Now things seeme to goe in some confusion, and disorder in the <note place="margin">His honour.</note> world; Good men, the children of God are not alwayes best in the place of judgement; <hi>I have seene</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) an evill under</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 3. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>the Sunne, that in the place of judgement wickednesse was there, and in the place of righteousnesse, that iniquitie was there;</hi> this observation <hi>Solomon</hi> makes, <hi>therefore I said, God will bring to judgement every thing, both good and evill, for there is a time for every worke, and every purpose.</hi> God hath a time to doe that great worke that he hath now purposed: What is that worke? that is, to <hi>bring every worke to judgement, whether it bee good or evill.</hi> I say, if wee consider this, it is necessary that there should come a judgement, that shall set all right againe.</p>
                  <p>It is necessarie likewise in respect of the Saints. <note place="margin">2. In respect of the Saints. 2 Thes. 1. 5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The very tribulations of the Saints in 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 5. are called <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digma,</hi> an evident demonstration, or a manifest token of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgement of God.</p>
                  <p>There is a necessitie of it in respect of them, in two regards.</p>
                  <p>First, that their innocencie that is traduced here may bee mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest. <note place="margin">For the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</note> They undergoe many disgraces, and hard censures amongst men: the world accounts them proud, hipocrites, singular, foolish,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14764:14"/>
vaine-glorious, and I know not what: now saith <hi>Iob, my witnesse is in heaven;</hi> and saith Saint <hi>Paul, I care not to bee judged of you, or of mans judgement, hee that judgeth me is the Lord.</hi> The Word, in the Greeke is, <hi>mans day;</hi> as if hee should say, Men have their day here, but God hath a greater day after, the Lord will judge in another manner, and upon other grounds then men doe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is necessary also, that their workes may be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. When we speake of reward, wee meane not the reward of <note place="margin">For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their workes.</note> merit, wee meane the reward of grace, called a reward, because God is tied to it by his promise. The servants of God, though they serve him with all care, they have not the fatte of the earth, as sometimes the Ishmaels of the world have, they doe not abound with outward things as many others doe: nay, sometimes they are in the worst condition, and that makes Gods wayes the more despised, as if God were not able to maintaine his servants in the world in his wayes and worke. God therefore hath a time when his servants shall <hi>have full measure, heaped up, pressed downe, shaken together, and running over.</hi> When God shall <hi>make up his jewels</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, it is necessarie in respect of the wicked too: that is, <note place="margin">3. In respect of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, that Gods righteousnesse may fully be manifested.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that their unrighteousnesse may fully bee punished.</p>
                  <p>First, I say, that Gods righteousnesse may fully bee manifested, <note place="margin">For the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding against them. Rom. 2. 5.</note> therefore the day of Iudgement in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5. is called a <hi>day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgement of God:</hi> As if hee should say: As God will manifest his wrath against the <hi>vessels of wrath,</hi> so hee will make it appeare to the world, that hee proceedeth in a right manner, and by a right rule in judging.</p>
                  <p>For wee must know, that howsoever God cannot bee unjust, and howsoever that the ungodly men in this life contend with their owne consciences, such is the hardnesse of their hearts, and abundance of corruption that they would faine justifie themselves amongst men: and againe, howsoever it bee true that the soule when it is departed out of the body is under Gods particular judgement by an intelectuall elevation of it, that it may receive the sentence of the Iudge, by an illumination, and by such a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and contemplative discourse, and observation, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of Gods actions, as that by reflection upon it selfe, it may know it selfe to bee accursed, or acquitted, and accordingly is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14764:15"/>
entred into the possession either of happinesse or miserie. Yet all this is secret in the world, till the day of Gods tribunall come, wherein <hi>secret things shalbe made manifest,</hi> and things that have been done in darknesse, shall appeare before men and Angels.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. As Gods justice must be cleared, and fully manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, so the wicked and unrighteous must bee fully punished. <note place="margin">For the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secting of their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> They are not fully punished, when they are under the sense of Gods wrath in this life, or when the soule is judged at death, there must bee yet a further degree for all this. And there be these two reasons for it.</p>
                  <p>The first is, because the wicked not only sinne in soule, but in body too, the body hath beene the instrument of the soule in sinning, and therfore it cannot serve the turne, that the soule is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and the body lie in the graue; no, but those that have joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in sin, must also joyne in punishment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, howsoever the sinfull actions of the wicked are transcient, and seeme to die with them, yet in respect of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion and evill effects, these actions worke upon others, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on posteritie by the ill example of their predecessors, the actions, I say, of those wicked men continue to the day of Iudgement. Thus wee shall see the <hi>Iewes</hi> in <hi>Ierem.</hi> 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>. reuived the sinnes of their fathers. <hi>Our fathers</hi> (say they) <hi>made cakes to the Queen of heaven, and so willwee.</hi> So the succeeding Kings of Israel, that went on in the steps of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> who made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin, they continued the sin of <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.</hi> As long as men go on in the steps, and sins of their forefathers the sins of their forefathers live: so that some mens sinnes by a continued imitation, are perpetuated to the day of Iudgement, therefore there must be a judgement then, that may fill up a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure proportionable to their sinne. This was that that <hi>Dives</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Hell, and that made him crie out as hee did, that <hi>one might goe and tell his brethren upon earth,</hi> that they <hi>might not come into that place;</hi> Why would hee have them tell his brethren? was there such love to the kingdome of Christ in hell, that <hi>Dives</hi> would have his brethren converted? no such matter. Was it love to the soules of his brethren, that hee would not have them damned? no such matter neither. What then? Certainly it was nothing else, but a sense of his owne guilt, hee knew what evill example hee had giuen, and what a counseller hee had beene to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and if they should goe on in his steps, and their children follow the same steps, all this would but adde to his punishment, and torment in the great day, when soule and body shall bee joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, to make up the full measure of their torment. For this reason, I say, it is therefore necessary that there should bee a judgement after this life, at the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>The second thing remaineth, and that is, why the holy Ghost
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14764:15"/>
expresseth Gods proceedings, by way of reckoning, or <hi>calling to an account?</hi> What need the Lord reckon with men, he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <note place="margin">Why God is said to call all men to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</note> by way of a Iudge, but he saith, come give an account of thy <hi>stewardship?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer; There are foure things implied in this, all shewing the manner of Gods proceedings, at the day of judgement with his <hi>stewards,</hi> that it shall bee like the proceedings of a Master with his seruants in an <hi>account</hi> and reckoning.</p>
                  <p>The first is this, that it shall bee a proceeding in particulars. <note place="margin">1. Because he will proceed in particular.</note> God shall then proceed not by grosse sums, and in the totall; yee have done evill in the generall: none will deale thus with an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countant, but he will run over the particulars, and Account for pounds, for pence, for every thing. Thus God will deale with all his <hi>stewards,</hi> when hee bringeth them to a reckoning, hee will reckon on particulars, for all things that hee hath enabled them with for his service.</p>
                  <p>Those that are rich men, first, how they have gotten their estates, whether <hi>they have built their houses as a moth,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> speakes, <note place="margin">Job 27. 18.</note> that is, raised their estates to the hurt of others, as men doe that raise themselves by Vsurie, and oppression, and fraud, and bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and such like courses.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, how they have kept their wealth, whether with the injurie of others, <hi>with-holding the goods from the owners therof,</hi> from the poore, for I call them in case of want the owners of their goods, because God hath given them to his <hi>stewards</hi> for their sakes: therefore marke how Saint <hi>Iames</hi> expresseth it, <hi>Goe to now,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 5. 1, 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>yeerich men, weepe and howle, why so? your riches are corrupted, and your garments moth-eaten, your gold and silver is cankered,</hi> &amp;c. As if hee should say, you have beene hoarding up your treasures, you had rather bee laying of it up, then laying of it out, and therefore because you have not layed out your estates for the service of your master, <hi>rust is come upon your gold, and the moth hath eaten into your garments, yee have heaped treasure together for the last day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, how they have spent what they have had, whether on their lusts or no; <hi>Yee aske and have not</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Iames) because yee</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">James 4. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>aske amisse to spend it on your lusts,</hi> so yee lay out amisse, yee spend it on your lusts. When men for pride in apparell, for excesse at their tables, for vaine buildings, for sinfull upholding of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for unnecessary, and injurious proceedings in law sutes, or in whatsoever indirect course men lay out their estates, it is a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spending of their Masters goods. And as hee that hath got his wealth unjustly, and hee that keepeth it unjustly, shall <hi>give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi> so hee that layeth it out in a confused, sinfull, profuse way shall be called <hi>to give areckoning</hi> for that.</p>
                  <p>And not only for matter of estate, but besides, for matter of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14764:16"/>
place and authoritie. <hi>Moses</hi> knew this well enough, and therefore when hee was to goe out of the world, hee first cleares all recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings with the people of Israel: I have beene a Ruler thus long, let any man come and stand up and say, I have done him wrong: let every man come and cleare me this day before the Lord, that I have walked all my life time unblameably, inoffensively, promoting the glory of God, and suppressing all the evill that I could with my might: this was the account that <hi>Moses</hi> made with the people of Israel before hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ed, that hee might <hi>lift up his head with comfort in the day of the Lord.</hi> Thus it must bee with you, yee must give an <hi>account</hi> of your places.</p>
                  <p>And so for the state of your bodies. The health thou hast had: how hast thou spent thy strength and thy health? Marke the speech of the Wise man to the young man, <hi>Rejoyce</hi> (saith hee) <hi>in the dayes of thy youth;</hi> as if hee should say: Doe if thou wilt, doe if thou dare, but <hi>know that for all these things thou must come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Now thou hast a great deale of health, a great deale of strength, but hast thou beene the better for Gods service? hast thou imployed it for Gods glory or no?</p>
                  <p>And so for the members of thy body, thou must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for thy imployment of those instruments. Thy tongue: <hi>every idle word</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>that men shall speake, they shall give an</hi>

Thou must give an account for thy tongue. And so for every member, and for every sense, I cannot stand upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>

                  <p>In a word, whatsoever abilitie thou hast, whereby thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test have beene beneficiall, and serviceable to the Church and Common-wealth, thou must give an account of it in particular unto God, hee will call thee to a reckoning of every parcell by it selfe.

                  <p>Secondly, it is called a reckoning, because in this reckoning, God will goe by a method, keepe an order, such an order as men <note place="margin">2. Because he will proceed by method and order.</note> doe in reckoning with their accomptants, every thing hath his due place: God will proceed to give every one in the day of judgement his due place; and yee shall find then, many sinnes that yee have accounted the lightest of all, will bee the most heaviest, and grievous at that day. <hi>I will set thy sinnes in order before thee,</hi> saith God in <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. Hee had reckoned them up confusedly here, <note place="margin">Psal. 50.</note> 
                     <hi>these things thou hast done,</hi> but, <hi>I will set them in order before thee.</hi> God will observe such an order, as every thing shall have its due place, its due head.</p>
                  <p>In the first place shall be that Apostacie, whereof all <hi>Adams</hi> posteritie are guiltie. This <hi>David</hi> saw, and therefore when hee judged himselfe, hee judged himselfe as one borne in sinne. <hi>I was borne in sinne, and in sinne hath my mother conceived mee.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place shall bee that concupiscence, that deprava<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>n of nature, from whence all actuall sinnes proceed. This Saint <hi>Paul</hi> knew, and therefore hee bewaileth it as the originall, and root of <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> all other actuall sinnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. God will begin first with the sins of the heart, because thence commeth all the outward actions of the whole man.</p>
                  <p>Then all the outward actions. Hee will begin first with those against the first Table, Atheisme, infidelitie, prophanenesse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God, and his service, neglect of his glory, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities hee hath given us.</p>
                  <p>And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>hen the Law and the Gospell come together, hee will proceed more severely, for the sinnes against the Gospell, then the Law. That is the reason that our Saviour telleth us, that it shall bee <hi>easier for Sodome and Gomorah, then for Capernaum at the day of Iudgement.</hi> Why so? <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorah</hi> had the Law, but <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum</hi> had the Law and the Gospell too: And (saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Heb,</hi> 10.) <hi>If they that obeyed not Moses Law died, of how much sorer judgement shall they bee guiltie of, that disobey the Gospel of Christ, the law of faith?</hi> Thus God will proceed.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, when yee would exercise repentance, follow Gods order, mourne more for impenitencie, and infidelitie, then <note place="margin">A direction in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> for other things.

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>econd, though these must bee lamented, and repented of too. Againe, be more in lamenting the inward sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full disposition of thy heart, then thy outward sinfull actions: and forget not the originall root of all, which we brought with us into
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14764:17"/>
the world. I say, marke Gods method, and his order: that which hee takes most notice of at the day of Iudgement, lay that to thy thoughts, and take greatest notice of it now.</p>
                  <p>It is a grievous thing for a man to be borne in sinne, but to adde actuall sinnes to that, it is more grievous. For a man to sinne in thought, and in heart is grievous, but to adde actuall sinnes to those, it is more grievous. It is a grievous thing for a man to sin against righteousnesse, to deale unjustly with men, but to deale unrighteously with God in point of his worship, is more grievous. It is a grievous sinne for a man to disobey the law of God, but to disobey the law of faith, to delay repentance, to deferre turning unto God, is far more grievous. Thus we should marke Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that hee will observe, when he bringeth us to a reckoning.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is called a reckoning, because God will proceed with men at that day (as Masters with their servants) by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, <note place="margin">3. Because he will proceed by books. Dan. 10. Rev. 20.</note> by bookes. In the tenth of <hi>Daniel, the booke was opened,</hi> and in the 20. <hi>Revel.</hi> there is mention made of <hi>bookes that should bee ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> God will proceed with all his <hi>stewards,</hi> upon bookes that shall be opened. The bookes are either the booke of the Law, that shewes what wee should have done: <hi>The words that I speake</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>the same shall judge you at the last day.</hi> And there <hi>is</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 48.</note> 
                     <hi>one that judgeth you, even Moses that is read daily.</hi> And then second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is the booke of Conscience, that shewes what wee have done here: God will put the memories of men to the taske, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> did <hi>Dives, Sonne remember that thou in thy life time hadest thy pleasure.</hi> So, remember that thou in thy life time haddest riches, but how didst thou imploy them? remember that thou hadest Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and office, and place in the Church or Common-wealth, but what service didest thou doe to God? remember that thou haddest wisedome, and learning, and knowledge, but what good had the Church or Common-wealth by it? God I say, will put every mans memorie to the taske, what opportunities are lost carelesly; nay, what opportunities he avoided wilfully, when hee might have done God better service, yet lest he should bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantaged in his by-respects in the world hee bauked them: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The sinnes of Iudah</hi> (saith God) <hi>are written with a penne of Iron, and with the point of a Diamond, they are graven upon the table of their</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 17. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>hearts.</hi> God hath the sinnes of men graven on the table of their hearts. Little doest thou that art an old man, thinke of a thousand things, that God will bring against thee, that were done in thy youth. <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> little thought till the day of his affliction, when <hi>God made him possesse the sinnes of his youth,</hi> that there was such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of guilt against him as there was. God will remember that, that thou hast forgot;</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:14764:17"/>
God will proceed by bookes, and this will cleare Gods justice in his proceedings, and make every thing appeare righteous in the sight of men and Angels, because every mans conscience shall te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie against himselfe, and therefore the mouth of all ungodly men shall be stopped at the day of the Lord, they shall have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to say for themselves, why justice should not proceed against them. Here (will God say) I find so much given to usurie; so much gotten by usurie; so much spent in vaine; so much kept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriously from the furtherance of Gods worship, and planting the gospell where it was wanting; so much kept from benefitting the Church and Common-wealth, in publike, in private; so much from helping the poore: here I find it, how comes it here? was it not written with thy owne hand? was it not thy selfe that made this impression upon thy conscience by thy owne guilt? What wilt thou say for thy selfe? hath any one accused thee wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? hath any one wrote it by mistake? No, all is done with thy owne hand, and you cannot deny your owne hand writing, when it is brought to your face. Hath any one had the keeping of this booke of thy conscience? hast thou not alwayes had it in thy owne possession? what canst thou alledge for thy selfe?</p>
                  <p>I know (beloved) and it is true, that there are many other waies whereby ungodly men shall be accused at the last day: God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe shall accuse thee, and <hi>bee a swift witnesse against thee,</hi> the Saints shall accuse thee, wicked men shall accuse thee, the divels shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse thee: but the maine proceeding, and that that shall cleare Gods justice, and stop the mouthes of all ungodly men is this, that the accusation is by their owne hand-writing, their owne booke shall accuse them, that they have wasted their Lords goods and mis-spent them.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and last thing wherein this proceeding at the last day, shall be like a reckoning is this. That there shall an account <note place="margin">4. Because God will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act of every one, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what he hath been trusted with.</note> be made in measure, and proportion to the trust committed to men. The Master when hee reckoneth with his servant, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him to account, not for some lesser summes, or for some one or two things, but for all that he hath intrusted him with, and if one servant have more then another, his account shall be greater then anothers, according to the greatnesse of that that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, so shall the largenesse of his reckoning be, <hi>to whom much is given, of them much is expected,</hi> and to whom little, <note place="margin">Luke 12. 48.</note> little is expected, but of every one something is expected, because every one is a <hi>Steward.</hi> The reckoning, I say, it shall bee according to the difference of gifts and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherewith wee are intrusted. When the Master in the Gospell, called his servants to an account for the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, wee see he that had ten Talents, made account for ten, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14764:18"/>
he that had five, for five, and he that had one, was called to an account, but for one, every one for so much as hee had received. Hee that hath received bodily abilities of health, and strength shall account for that: Hee that hath had wealth, and an estate in the world, shall make an account further for that. Hee that hath had all these, and authoritie and place, wherein he had power to doe right, and to glorifie God amongst men, he must make an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for so much the more.</p>
                  <p>Alas beloved, if men consider, that the more wealth, they heape up, and the more places of authority, and preferments, they have in the world, their accounts shall bee greater at the day of the Lord, certainly it would make them more sober, and walke more humbly, and watchfully, it would make them so much the more industrious, to improve their talents, to the best advantage of their Lord that intrusted them with them.</p>
                  <p>So much for the opening of the point. I will conclude briefly with a few usesof it.</p>
                  <p>Yee see (Beloved) not onely that all are Gods <hi>stewards,</hi> but that all Gods <hi>stewards</hi> shall be brought to a reckoning, brought <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. For confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to it in this life, and in another. Yee see why it is called a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, why God will proceed with men in this manner. The first Vse then shall be for confutation of those Atheists, that put far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e from them the feare of the day of Iudgement.</p>
                  <p>Is it possible that there should be a generation in the world, <note place="margin">Atheists in the Church.</note> that should doubt of the Iudgement to come? Nay, shall wee goe further and come neerer, not onely in the world, but in the Church, that there should be such as doubt of that time and day? By that that is done daily, it appeares that there be many at this day in the Church, that doubt of a Iudgement day.</p>
                  <p>First, doe but trie mens courses. What sinnes doe they most feare, and most avoide? by that yee shall know what Iudgement they feare, and what they feare not. They feare only such sinnes as in the course of justice, men and their lawes take hold of: such as are only a breach of the second table. Men will not be injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to men, lest men proceed in mans justice against them. But how commeth it to passe that there is so little regard of God? of reverence of his name? of setting up his worship in their houses, and in their hearts? Certainly you doe not thinke that God will be as exact in his judgement, in matters that concerne his own honour immediately, as any man will be in cases that are brought before him.</p>
                  <p>Againe, doe not men feare those outward actions which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to the censure of men on earth, and unto punishment here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But in the meane time they feare not evill affections, and the motions of sinne in their owne hearts. A man would not bee
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14764:18"/>
tooke with open theft, yet neverthelesse hee useth fraud, when men cannot discerne it. A man would not be tooke with mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet neverthelesse he is full of malice, and envie, and repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Why is this, but because men acknowledge not a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come? They feare not the judgement of God, wherein he will bring the breaches of the first Table to an account, as well as those of the second, and the secret thoughts, and sinnes of the heart, to a reckoning, as well as outward actions.</p>
                  <p>Such mockers there were in the time of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> against whom he speakes in his second Epistle, and third chapter. Wee <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.</note> will a little observe the method of the Apostle, that we may see how he discovereth them. Say the mockers, <hi>there shall bee no</hi> Iudgement. There shall, saith the Apostle. How can that bee? <hi>Have not all things continued as they were, since the beginning of the Creation for so many thousand yeares?</hi> And why should we thinke that there should come any alteration after, more then before? Yee are deceived (saith he) all things have not continued alike, the <hi>world was drowned by water.</hi> But if they doe continue, <hi>it is by the word of God,</hi> and that Word that gave a beeing to them, that Word will put an end to them, God can as easily by his word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all things, as by his Word hee made all things. But some will say, by what instrument will he destroy the world? <hi>By fire.</hi> How can that be, for that is one of the maine parts, the maine matter whereof things were made, and shall that be the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that whereof it is made? Yes (saith the Apostle) All things were made by water too, and yet they were destroyed by water, and why not then by fire? But <hi>God deferreth the promise of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming?</hi> What of that? He putteth it not quite off, though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, yet <hi>it is not long with God,</hi> for there is no time long to him that is eternall: and in that he deferreth, it is that some men may be brought to salvation, and others made inexcusable. Thus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle takes off all objections of the Atheists of the world, and sheweth that there shall be a day of Iudgement.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it serveth for instruction. If there shall be such a <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. For instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. 1. Not to judge others.</note> Iudgement to come, if God will have such a time of reckoning with all his <hi>stewards</hi> in the world. Then it teacheth us first, not to busie our selves in judging one another, why? because there shall a time come of Gods Iudgement. <hi>Who art thou</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>that judgest thy brother? wee shall all stand before the judgement seate of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ.</hi> Asif he should say; What a bold part? what a presumptuous part is this, that thou shouldst judge thy brother? Dost thou not know that there is one that shall judge him and thee? is it fit that he that is a prisoner at the Barre should come and leape up into the place of the Iudge, and sit in his seat? Yee are all fellow prisoners together, and yee must all stand before the judgement seat of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14764:19"/>
Christ. So in another place the same Apostle, when hee would take men off from judging, saith hee; <hi>Iudge nothing before the time:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Why? for the Lord will come, who both will bring to light, the hidden things of darknesse, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then shall every man have praise of God.</hi> As if hee should say; Thou art not able to judge aright, it may bee that man that thou dispraisest at that day, may find praise with God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. Turne the judgement on thy owne heart, bee more in judging of thy selfe, that thou mayest not bee judged of the <note place="margin">2. To judge our selves here.</note> Lord. Will God call thee to a reckoning? then begin to call thy selfe to a reckoning first.</p>
                  <p>How shall that bee done?</p>
                  <p>There is a double reckoning that every man must undergoe, that will avoid this reckoning with God. <note place="margin">A twofold reckoning to be made here.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, hee must reckon with his owne heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, with others.</p>
                  <p>First with his owne heart. Every man must take all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and opportunities that God hath given, to reckon with <note place="margin">1. Reckon with our selves.</note> himselfe. Doth God awaken thy conscience by the preaching of his word? Descend into thy owne heart; It is that that the Lord lookes for, that a man should say, <hi>What have I done?</hi> Doth God smite thee with someafflictions, if with losses? reckon with thy <note place="margin">Jer. 8. 6.</note> selfe how thou hast gained thy wealth: If with disgraces, reckon with thy selfe about thy pride, and ambition, and vanitie of thy heart. If God smite thy body with sicknesse: reckon with thy selfe about the imployment of thy health, and the well usage of the times and seasons of grace. Every evening call thy selfe to an account; What have I done this day? where have I beene? In what company? how have I carried my selfe there? what good have I done? what good have I received? In the matters of thy calling, reckon with thy selfe, with what heart thou hast follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, with what care to conforme thy selfe to Gods word, the rule of righteousnesse. If thou hast been in pleasures, whether they were lawfull, and if they were, whether they were lawfully used. Thus must every man reckon with his owne heart; as the Church in <hi>Lament. 3. 39. Wherefore is the living man sorrowfull? Man suffereth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 39.</note> 
                     <hi>for his sinne, let us search our wayes, and turne againe to the Lord.</hi> There are many that thinke to out-face God, and men, in their sinnes: but know this who-ever thou art, that if thou forbeare to reckon with thy owne heart, God will assuredly reckon with thee, thou must reckon here, or hereafter, with thy selfe, or with God: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith <hi>David</hi> Psal. 4. <hi>Commune with your owne hearts upon your</hi>

                     <hi>beds;</hi> that is, bee sure to take time from your sleepe, rather then to neglect this businesse of reckoning with your owne hearts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Reckon with others too. Let that man that is in <note place="margin">2. Reckon with others.</note>

authoritie, a Magistrate, so carry himselfe in his imployments, that he may reckon with the people, and give an account to them if need be, as <hi>Samuel</hi> did, <hi>Whose oxe have I taken? or whose asse have</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? The Lord</hi> (saith hee) <hi>is a witnesse that yee have not found any thing in my hand.</hi> And not only so, but that they may bee able to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that they have beene great instruments of Gods glory, and of the good of others.</p>
                  <p>Let Ministers reckon with the people committed to their charge, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, when hee tooke his leave of the Ephesians, and was to goe up to <hi>Ierusalem; I take you to record this day</hi> (saith he) <note place="margin">Acts 20. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>that I am pure from the bloud of all men, for I have not shunned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to you the whole counsell of God, and I have kept backe nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and taught you publikely, and from house to house.</hi> And because I know that <hi>after my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there will somewhat</hi> remaine to be done, for <hi>Grievous wolves will enter in, not sparing the flocke,</hi> therefore I will be carefull that there be a succession of faithfull Ministers after me, and therefore I give charge to the rest that follow, that <hi>they take heed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to the flocke over which the holy Ghost hath made them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers, to feed the Church of God, which hee hath purchased with his owne bloud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let Masters, reckon with their Families, their servants and children, whether they have done their dutie as faithfull Masters, not only in furthering the service of God, but also in furthering of them by instruction, and example to all good.</p>
                  <p>Let those that are in a way of traffique, learne to reckon with those that they deale withall. If thou hast wronged any by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just gaine, thou must reckon with him by restitution: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that thou hast gotten unjustly, for which thou dost not rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon now, but (as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith) at that day <hi>shall eat thy flesh as it were fire.</hi> Therefore <hi>Zacheus, when salvation was brought to his</hi>

                     <hi>house,</hi> If <hi>I have done unjustly, and wronged any, I restore it.</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse there are many men that cloathe themselves in Sattin and Velvet, and abound in all varietie and bravery, that would now be houselesse and monilesse, and apparellesse, it may bee, if they should make restitution of their unjust gaine. Well, doe it, as yee love your owne soules: you shall reckon as you are Gods <hi>stewards</hi> with him, how you have come by every penny that you have in the world, and therefore goe about it now.</p>
                  <p>Reckon with others also for workes of mercie, what thou hast beene wanting in to thy breth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>to die, and after that the Iudgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You have now a spectacle of mortalitie before you: one of <hi>Gods stewards</hi> tooke away, and called by death to give up his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Concerning whom, it cannot bee expected that I should say much, orany thing at all, specially by those that know both the condition of his living, and of his dying.</p>
                  <p>For his living. It was not in the Citie, but for the most part, it was from us in the Countrey.</p>
                  <p>For his dying. Hee was here but a day or two before hee was taken hence. Hee came to the Citie in the extremitie of his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and it tooke him with some violence, as the nature of that disease, the stone, is. There was much expression expected from him: but it pleased God to make a sudden change more then wee looked for, for (as I said) his disease seized on him with such violence, and extremitie, that he had no space for any thing but to pray us, to pray with him, and for him.</p>
                  <p>That which wee may learne from such examples as these, is this; That wee therefore bee good <hi>stewards</hi> in the time of our life. Wee know not what violent sicknesse may seize upon us, and how it may dis-inableus, to expresse our selves to men, or to set our reckonings even with God. Bee serious therefore in the point, while you have health and strength. All of you are now called to a reckoning by the preaching of the Word and Gospell, if this will not prevaile, expect another calling by sicknesse, by terrours of conscience, by death. You are not sure but that the next calling may bee by death, as it was with this our brother; let mee put this therefore as a remembrance to every one of you, that you behave your selves as dying daily; Remember thou art a <hi>Steward,</hi> and <hi>must give an account of thy stewardship. Alexander</hi> had his Remembrancer. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> had another Remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, <hi>Whether I eate or drinke</hi> (saith hee) <hi>or whatsoever I doe, mee thinkes I heare the voyce of the last trumpet, and of the Arch-Angell, Arise you dead, and come to judgement.</hi> Let mee now bee thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer. Remember thou art a <hi>Steward,</hi> and that thou must bee called to an <hi>account</hi> of thy <hi>stewardship.</hi> When thou art in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties, remember thou must give an account with what strength thou servest God. When thou art in businesse, in thy familie, remember thou must give an account how thou hast walked toward thy servants, toward thy children, toward them that God hath given thee. Thou that hast an estate, remember that thou must give an account to the great Lord, of the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and of the spending of that estate.

how thou commest to them, how thou hast behaved thy selfe in them. Let every one remember, that hee must give an <hi>account</hi> of what service hee hath done to his Master; of what use hee hath beene unto God, and what to others. The more God hath beene glorified, and others benefited, the more shall our soules be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted at that great day of appearance, when the least smile of GODS countenance, will bee worth a thousand worlds, and the testimonie of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will bee preferred before all the treasures of the Earth.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former Chapter, the Wise man had <note place="margin">The Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> beene shewing the vanitie, and insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of all earthly things to make a man happie, and how much the world is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken, in seeking happinesse in any thing here below. In this Chapter, and those that follow, he commeth to direct men in the right way to find it, and sheweth them where they should seeke it, and where they should finde it: First he telleth them of a <hi>good name,</hi> in the first verse. <hi>A good name is better then precious ointment.</hi> The second meanes is, <hi>a good death, the day of death is better than the day of ones birth.</hi> The third is, a right <hi>mourning, it is better to goe to the house of mourning, then to the house of feasting.</hi> Afterward he proceedeth to other particulars. But this he bringeth in upon the former, to prevent an objection that some might make: for having said that <hi>the day of death, is better then the day of ones birth;</hi> some might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: What goodnesse can there be in death? as for those that are
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14764:24"/>
dead, they cease to be, and they that are alive reape no benefit by it, but mourning, and there is little good, little happinesse in this, to exercise a mans thoughts about mournfull objects; Yes (saith he) it is <hi>better to goe to the house of mourning, then to the house of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the living will lay it to his heart.</hi> And upon this he spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth some time, because naturally we are exceeding backward, to beleeve that it is good for a man to be mourning upon earth.</p>
                  <p>Others make the dependance of the words thus; That <hi>Solomon</hi> having before shewed the vani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ie of riches, he doth in the six for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verses of this Chapter, preferre even death it selfe, before wealth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> abundance. And he sheweth wherein it is better.</p>
                  <p>First in the Adjuncts. The Adjunct of <hi>death</hi> is <hi>mourning:</hi> the Adjunct of wealth and abundance is <hi>feasting:</hi> yet <hi>mourning</hi> is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>feasting.</hi> And because it seemeth a Parradox to every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man, he commeth to confirme and prove it.</p>
                  <p>By the Effects. In the third verse; <hi>Sorrow is better then laughter, for by the sadnesse of the countenance, the heart is made better.</hi> Sorrow can doe that for us that wealth cannot, it <hi>makes the heart better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the different subjects in which they are. That same world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>mirth is in the heart of fooles.</hi> In the fourth verse: <hi>the heart of fooles, is in the house of mirth:</hi> but this <hi>mourning</hi> it is in the <hi>heart of the wise: the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the Efficient cause. One cause of <hi>mourning</hi> is the <hi>rebukes of the wise.</hi> In the fifth verse; <hi>It is better to heare the rebukes of the wise, then for a man to heare the song of fooles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then in the sixth verse by a <hi>Prolepsis</hi> he prevents an obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that some might make. For whereas he had said that <hi>mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> was better then joy, some might say. It seemeth otherwise, there is delight in <hi>joy,</hi> there is none in <hi>mourning.</hi> Hee telleth them that that delight, it is but a very short delight, but <hi>as the cracking of thornes under a pot, it is but vanitie. As the cracking of thornes under a pot, so is the laughter of a foole, this also is vanitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We will not stand much about the matter. So many severall men as handle this booke, doe severally connect and joyne the words together, according to their owne conceits and opinions of them.</p>
                  <p>It is evident, that in this verse that I have now read to you, the Wise man speakes of such a <hi>mourning,</hi> as is occasioned by the <hi>death</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The meaning of the words.</note> of friends. And he saith of that <hi>mourning,</hi> that <hi>it is better then to bee in the house of feasting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That he speakes of such a <hi>mourning,</hi> appeares by that which followeth: first he saith, that that is <hi>the end of all men,</hi> he speakes therefore of such a <hi>mourning,</hi> as is upon the <hi>end</hi> of men, upon the departure of men out of this world: and secondly he saith, <hi>the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving will lay it to his heart:</hi> hee speakes of such an <hi>end</hi> of men, as is opposite to the <hi>life</hi> of men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:14764:24"/>
In a word. <hi>By the house of mourning,</hi> he meaneth a house where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in some one is dead, which giveth occasion to the parties that dwell there, of sorrow and <hi>mourning</hi> for their departed friend. <hi>It is better to goe to such a house.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the <hi>house of feasting,</hi> hee meaneth not onely such a house wherein there is feasting, but also all manner of abundance: as commonly men shew their wealth in feasting.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>the end of all men,</hi> he meaneth that which the Schooles calls the <hi>end of termination.</hi> Now there is a twofold <hi>end of termination</hi> (as they speake) either <hi>Positive,</hi> or <hi>Privative.</hi> A <hi>Positive</hi> end, as a point is the end of a lyne, and an instant is the end of time: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the lyne resolveth it selfe into a point at last, and all time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveth it selfe at last into an instant. A <hi>Privative</hi> end, and that is that that causeth a cessation of beeing, that is the end of action, wherein all the worke, and invention, and enterprizes of a man cease. Of such an end here he speakes, such an end of a man as that he ceaseth to be as he was upon earth, and ceaseth to doe as he did upon earth.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>laying to heart,</hi> he meaneth more then a bare knowing, or a bare observing, and taking notice of things. There is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood here, a serious pondering, an often considering of it, as it is said of <hi>Marie, Shee layed those sayings to heart;</hi> and so <hi>Iacob, hee layed the sayings of Ioseph to heart.</hi> It is such a serious considering, and pondering, and discussing of every thing, as they may bring it to some use, may draw some fruit, and benefit out of it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>So that the summe and substance of the words is thus much; <hi>It is a better thing for a man to bee conversant about the thoughts of death, and to take hold of all occasions that may bring the serious consideration thereof into his heart, then to delight himselfe in those worldly pleasures, and sensuall delights, wherein for the most part men spend their lives.</hi> The reason is, <hi>because there is some benefit that ariseth thereby to the inward man, some advantage gained to the soule: whereas by the other, there is none at all, there is much hinderance and hurt, but no furtherance and benefit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words then you see consist of a Proposition; And a proofe <note place="margin">The devision of the words.</note> or confirmation of that Proposition.</p>
                  <p>The Proposition. <hi>It is better to goe to the house of mourning, then to goe to the house of feas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Confirmation or proofe of it, is double; first, because <hi>this is the end of all men:</hi> secondly, because <hi>the living will lay it to his heart.</hi> This latter part is that which I purpose most to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon.</p>
                  <p>In the former. Hee calleth the house wherein any one dies, <hi>the house of mourning. It is better to goe to the house of mourning.</hi>

                  <p>The holy Ghost would not have described the house wherein a man dies in this manner, if there were not some equitie, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in mourning, upon such an occasion. For hee speakes not here (as I conceive) only with reference, and respect to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon custome of naturall and worldly men; but with respect to the naturall disposition, and affection, that is in the heart of man, and the equitie of the thing.

                     <hi>mourne for Sarah, and to weepe for her.</hi> And <hi>Esau,</hi> when he speakes of the death of his father <hi>Isaac,</hi> he calleth the time of his death, the <hi>time of mourning, the dayes of mourning for my father are at hand.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 41.</note> So <hi>Ioseph</hi> when his father was dead, it is said that <hi>hee mourned for</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 50. 10. 2 Sam. 25. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>his father seven dayes.</hi> When <hi>Samuel</hi> was dead, all the Israelites <hi>were gathered together, and lamented him.</hi> When <hi>Iosiah</hi> was dead, there was such a great lamentation for him, that it became a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of excessive mourning; <hi>In that day there shall be a great mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Zach. 12. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>in Ierusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giddon.</hi> Our Saviour Christ, when he looked upon <hi>Lazarus,</hi> hee <hi>wept,</hi> because he was dead. And those Ephesians, this was it that <note place="margin">John 11.</note> broke their hearts, they <hi>sorrowed most of all for the words which S. Paul spake, that they should see his face no more.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 20. 38.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I need not stand upon the proofe of the point. There is great reason for it. First, if we respect men in their usefulnesse to others. <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> There is no man but is of some use: and so farre as a man is usefull to another, there is just ground of mourning, for the losse of such a one. Therefore <hi>David,</hi> he mourned for the death of <hi>Saul,</hi> though he was a wicked man, because he was usefull in his time by way of gouernment. And as there is more usefulnesse, so there is more cause of mourning, as we see in the death of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Iosiah,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because when those that are usefull, are taken away, a man seeth some effects partly of his owne guilt, and partly of <note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> Gods displeasure. Of his owne guilt; If those die that are evill, that he did not doe them that good that he might, while they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he did not converse so profitably, as he might have done, to further their spirituall good. If they be good and gracious, that he received not benefit by them, that he did not mannage the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, as he might have done, to have made that use of their societie and conference, of their prayers, and spirituall helpes, of all those gifts and endowments that they had. And as in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, so likewise in the excesse there is guilt. When a man idoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the creature too much, and trusteth too much to the arme of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14764:25"/>
flesh: when he setteth too great a price upon men, he may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the displeasure of God, taking away his brother, that was (as it were) a curtaine that stood betweene God and him, taking away those that hid God from his eyes.</p>
                  <p>Vpon these occasions and grounds, the servants of God have reflected upon themselves, seeing the death of others, that are neere, and deare unto them, and have drawne from thence, matter and cause of mourning.</p>
                  <p>Nay, it is a thing that the Lord lookes for: <hi>Thou hast smitten</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 5. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>them, and they have not grieved.</hi> When God takes away any that are usefull to us, there is a smiting, and a correction in it, even to those that live, to those that were intimate and inward with him, and God expects that men should <hi>mourne,</hi> and grieve for it.</p>
                  <p>I briefly note this (for I intend not to stand upon it) against that <note place="margin">Vse.</note> Stoicall Apethy, that stupiditie, I cannot say whether it have sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on the spirits of men, or whether men affect it in themselves: but they account this a matter of praise, a vertue praise-worthy, to see nothing dolefull, nothing worthy of mourning in the death of any one. We see it is quite contrarie to the very course of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>But it will be objected. We are bid to <hi>mortifie our earthly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note> and if we must mortifie our affections, we must mortifie all our affections, that of sorrow, as well as anger, and the like.</p>
                  <p>I answer briefly. The Scripture indeed biddeth us <hi>mortifie our</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                     <hi>affections,</hi> but it doth not bid us take away our affections: it bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us only mortifie, and purge out the corruption of our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Now there is a twofold corruption, and distemper in the <note place="margin">A twofold distemper in mens affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> affections of men. The first is, when they are misplaced, and set upon wrong objects: so we mourne for that we should rejoyce in, or wee rejoyce in that we should mourne for. Secondly, when <note place="margin">1.</note> they are either excessive or defective: either we over-doe, or wee <note place="margin">2.</note> doe not, either not at all, or not in that proportion, and measure that we should. Thus, when we over-grieve for worldly crosses, and too little for sinne; too much for the losse of earthly friends, and too little for the losse of Gods favour, and spirituall wants: this is a distemper of the affections in the defect, the heart growes earthly, and fixed upon the creature, and is drawne away, and estranged from God. Then there is the excesse: that the Apostle speakes of, when he exhorts them, <hi>not to mourne as men without</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>hope:</hi> whether he spake there of the Gentiles, as some thinke, that cut their heads, and made themselves bald, in the day of their mourning, an affected kind of outward shew they had to mourne, which the Lord forbad the people of <hi>Israel</hi> to doe: or whether <note place="margin">Deut. 14.</note> (as indeed it is) because they did not restraine inwardly, and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the exorbitant excesse of their affection, wee should not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14764:26"/>
mourne as the Gentiles, but as men of hope: mourne as men that can see the changes that God makes in the earth, and in your Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and can see how neere God commeth to you, and what use God would have you make of every particular tryall and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: mourne so farre as you see your owne guilt, in not making use of the opportunities you have had in enjoying your friends, and so farre as you see any evidence of displeasure from God: so farre we should mourne, but not as men without hope.</p>
                  <p>But I briefly passe this, intending not to insist upon it, only by occasion, because <hi>Solomon</hi> makes the place where any die, the <hi>house of mourning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee come now to the proofe of the point, why going to the <hi>house of mourning,</hi> taking these occasions to affect our hearts, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>then to goe to the house of feasting,</hi> then to take occasions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting our selves in outward things. What's the reason? It is double.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>This is the end of all men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is <hi>the end of all men? The house of mourning.</hi> That which he meaneth by the <hi>house of mourning</hi> here, is that which he calleth <hi>the end of all men,</hi> that which putteth an end to all men, and to their actions upon earth, and that is Death.</p>
                  <p>So that the maine point, that in this place the wise man intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is but thus much, I will deliver it in the very words of the Text, we need not varie from them at all.
<q>
                        <l>Death is the End of all men. <note place="margin">Observat. 2</note>
                        </l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Death is that which every man must expect, to be the end of <note place="margin">Death the end of all men.</note> his life, and of his actions. It is the common, the last condition of all men upon earth.</p>
                  <p>I will give you but two places of Scripture, that include all men in Death. One in <hi>Iob</hi> third, from the fourteenth verse, to the 20. verse of that Chapter, <hi>Iob</hi> sheweth there how <hi>Death is the End</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iob 3. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>of all men,</hi> he beginneth with the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Counsellers of the Earth,</hi> with <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>great warriours,</hi> and descendeth afterward to <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners and meane persons, to labourers, to servants, to small and great, all</hi> (saith he) <hi>lie downe in the dust, and goe to the place of silence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other place is in <hi>Zachar. 1. 5. Your fathers where are they? and the Prophets, doe they live for ever?</hi> That is, looke to all your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, <note place="margin">Zach. 1. 5.</note> that have beene in all times before you, whether they be those Fathers that you glory in, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and the rest, or those Fathers that disobeyed the word of Prophesie (which indeed is the principall thing here intended) all these An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient persons they are dead; or as S. <hi>Peter</hi> speakes, of those that were disobedient in the dayes of <hi>Noah, they are in prison,</hi> they are
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14764:26"/>
in the grave: yea, and the Prophets too, that preached to you, they are dead: the generations before you, both of Prophets and people, are all dead.</p>
                  <p>You see then, that <hi>Death is the common condition of all men.</hi> Kings and Subjects, Prophets and people, this is the last thing that shall be said of them all, they are dead.</p>
                  <p>And it must be so; First in regard of Gods decree. It is that <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. In regard of Gods decree.</note> that God hath appointed, and determined, concerning all men, that they must die: there is a statute for it in heaven, that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be reverst. It is appointed to all men once to die, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 17. <note place="margin">Heb 9. 27.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of that matter whereof all men are made, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. In regard of the matter whereof men are made. Job 13. 12.</note> of earth: <hi>Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt returne. Your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances</hi> (saith <hi>Iob) are like unto ashes, and your bodies, to bodyes of clay.</hi> How easie is it for the wind to blow away ashes? for a potter to breake in pieces a vessell of clay? so easie it is to put an end to the memories, and bodies of men, they are but ashes and clay.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in regard that every man hath in him, that that is the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. In regard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man in him, hath the cause of death.</note> cause of Death: sinne. It is that that is as poison in the spirits, and as rottennesse in the bones. Sinne brought in Death, and Death seizes upon all men; it consumeth all men from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by degrees. Shew me a man without sinne: without it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the committing of it, or without it in the guilt of it, you may then shew a man that shall not die: while all men are under sinne, they are under Death. Even our blessed Saviour Iesus Christ himselfe, though he did not sinne actually, yet because hee stood guiltie of our sins, Death seized upon him.</p>
                  <p>So then. Looke to Gods decree, that is, All men shall die. Looke to the matter whereof every man is made; that is, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying dying substance. And looke to the cause of death in all men, that is sinne. If any man can either escape Gods decree, or bring a man that is not made of such a mouldring matter, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and shew a man that hath no sinne in him: then you may shew a man that shall not die: but till then this conclusion remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that the wise man setteth downe, <hi>this is the end of all men, that they shall die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here it will be objected; Wee find some men that did not <note place="margin">Object. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>b.</hi> 11. 5.</note> die. It is said of <hi>Enoch, that he was translated,</hi> that <hi>hee should not see death,</hi> Heb. 11. 5. And of <hi>Elijah, that he went up by a whirle-wind into</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 King. 2. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>heaven in a chariot of fire. 2 King.</hi> 2. 11. These men did not die.</p>
                  <p>To this, I answer briefly. Particular and extraordinary exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> doe not frustrate generall rules: God may sometimes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence with some particular men, and yet the rule remaine firme. I say it may be so.</p>
                  <p>But secondly we answer. They had that that was in stead of Death to them, some change, though they did not die after the <note place="margin">2.</note>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:14764:27"/>
manner of other men. So at the end of the world, it is said, <hi>that those that are alive shall be caught up, and changed, in the twinckling of an eye;</hi> there shall be a sudden, and almost undiscernable, unperceivable change, which shall be to them in stead of death.</p>
                  <p>But it will be objected further. There is a promise made in <hi>Ioh. 11. That those that believe shall never die.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> Joh. 11.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I answer with that common distinction; There is a twofold death, which the Scripture calleth, the <hi>first and the second</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                     <hi>death:</hi> The <hi>first death,</hi> is the death of the body, that ariseth from a dis-junction, and separation of the body from the soule; And there is a <hi>second death,</hi> that ariseth from the dis-junction, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the soule from God. The <hi>first death,</hi> is no death proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>second death</hi> is that which is truly Death: and so they shall not die. A man may have a body separated from the soule, and yet not his soule separated from God, nor himselfe from Christ. <hi>Who shall separate us from the love of God in Christ? neither life, nor</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>death, nor principalities nor powers,</hi> &amp;c. Death you see shall not bee able to separate us from God: it cannot separate the soule: Nay, it doth not separate the body from Christ: the body remaineth a member of Christ, as well while it is still in the grave, as before: <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. <note place="margin">Matt. 22.</note> And therefore he proveth, that even <hi>Abraham</hi> was not dead in that sense, that they then tooke it, but hee remaineth yet alive, in as much as God was his God. <hi>Abraham</hi> (whole <hi>Abraham)</hi> was Gods by vertue of Covenant, so are all his posteritie, the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> by faith, in a spirituall sense they remaine with Christ, and they are united to him, as members to the head, even when their bodies are in the grave. So that (I say) they die not in that sense, so as to have their soule separated from God; though they die in the first sense, that is, to have their bodies separated from the soule. But our Saviour in that place of <hi>Iohn</hi> speakes of the <hi>second,</hi> of that death, which is an everlasting separation of the soule from God. As we say of wicked men, that while they are alive, they are dead; so the Apostle speakes of the <hi>widow that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in pleasures, while she lived, she was dead;</hi> and the Church of Sardis, <hi>had a name to live, but she was dead.</hi> This is true death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when that the soule of a man is separated, and dis-joyned from God, and from Christ: And it is the state of every man by nature, of every man under sinne, though they walke up and downe, and doe the actions of the living, yet they are but dead men. And as truly, as they are said to be dead while they live, so truly it may be said of the children of God, that while they are dead, they live: as it is said of <hi>Abraham,</hi> so it may bee said of all Gods servants, they die not properly, but remaine still in union with God, and with Christ: with God through Christ, they are
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14764:27"/>
Christs, and therefore Gods in him, and therefore they die not. Looke what the soule is to the bodie, that is God to the soule: the soule is the life of the body, and God is the life of the soule; they are still living men, that have God; the soule is alive, even when the body lieth downe in the grave. This shall serve for the opening of that, they are not dead, but alive: they doe die in the first sense, and in the common acceptation, in respect of the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the body from the soule; but they doe not die in the second sense, in respect of the separation of the soule from God, they doe not die eternally, they doe not die properly.</p>
                  <p>Now briefly to make some use of this, and to hasten to that I most intend to stand upon.</p>
                  <p>Is it so then, that <hi>Death is the end of all men.</hi> Let us make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it for ourselves.</note> of it for ourselves. This seemeth but a plaine point, and so indeed it is: but I know there is nothing more usefull, and I know there is nothing lesse regarded, and lesse considered of seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously then this, that we must die. It is true, wee all acknowledge it in the generall, and every man, the very worst, the most igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and most prophane in the world will yeeld to this in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, that all men must die, and let a man come and tell them, that they themselves must die, they will grant it too, but this is that that undoes us all, we rest in generals, and doe not seriously insist upon a serious application of it, to a mans owne particular case, and bring it home to a mans selfe; to conclude thus, I must die, I may die soone, this may be the last day of my life upon earth, this may be the last time I may breathe, this may be the last word that I shall speake, the last action that I shall doe; I know I must die, and it may be I may die now. This is that wee should principally intend, and labour most after, that when we reade the stories of the Scripture, and see that Death is the end of all men, that all must die, and their houses must be, <hi>houses of mourning,</hi> to conclude the same for our selves. All those worthies spoken of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. it is said, <hi>they all died in faith;</hi> I read such a man was a King, but he died; such a man was a Prophet, but hee died; such a man was Noble, but he died; such a one died in his youth, such a one in his strength, these died, and I must die; the same thing must be said of mee, that is said of them. I say, let us not only say it, but resolve, and conclude upon it; conclude for our selves, that the same thing must be said of us, that is said of all men; All men <note place="margin">The benefit of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of death to a mans selfe.</note> must die, we must die.</p>
                  <p>The benefit that floweth from it will be this;</p>
                  <p>First, when a man bringeth it to his owne particular case, it will make sinne more odious to him. What is it that brought Death <note place="margin">1. Sin will be made more odious. Rom. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>1.</note> into the world? what bringeth death upon us? Sinne. <hi>By one man sinne entred into the world, and death by sinne, and so death passeth upon
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14764:28"/>
all men, for that all have sinned.</hi> This I say is it, that will make sin odious to a man, it will make a man looke upon sinne as a deadly evill. A man will avoid an infectious disease, that is mortall and deadly, and pestilentiall, and the like; Why? because it is deadly, it is as much as his life is worth. The same is sinne, it is that that brought death upon all man-kind, and will bring it upon thee. When doth the creature forfeit his beeing to the Creator, but when he doth not use it in the service, and for the glory of the Creatour. God hath given the creature a beeing for himselfe, I have forfeited my beeing, when I glorifie not God with it; that man forfeiteth his wit, his memorie, his strength, his time, his life, and all that he is or hath, when he doth not imploy them in Gods service, to Gods glory. Now sinne is that that makes us deny the service and glory we owe to God; sin is that that makes a forfeiture of our lives, and all unto him. Here is the first thing, God hath given the creature a beeing for himselfe, he preserveth the creature in beeing for himselfe, when the creature therefore sinneth it forfeiteth its life and beeing to the Creator. This makes sinne odious.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this is it, that declareth the wonderfull justice, and <note place="margin">2. The truth and justice of God will bee the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged.</note> truth of God. Hee said to <hi>Adam</hi> in the beginning, assoone as ever he had fallen, <hi>hee should die:</hi> and we find it true on him, and all his posteritie: for <hi>Adam</hi> stood and represented the person of all men before God, that one man was all men: in him all men were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the sentence of death. And we see it is true to this day. Wee find God true in this, let this make us beleeve his word in every thing else. He hath beene as good as his word, he hath declared his justice, and his truth in the death of all man-kind upon the sin of <hi>Adam:</hi> he will declare it in every thing else, in every promise, in every threatning, in every passage of his word: let us giue him the glory of his truth, as we find it in this.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is advantageous very much for our selves, as a <note place="margin">3. Death will be the better prepared for.</note> meanes to prepare us for death the better. When a man seriously concludeth, <hi>Death is the end of all men,</hi> then if I reckon and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count my selfe amongst men, it will be my end too, and it may be my end now. And we shall see what use <hi>Iob</hi> makes of this: <hi>All the dayes of my appointed time, I will waite till my change shall come.</hi> I <note place="margin">Job 14. 14.</note> make account a great change will come, such as hath beene upon all my fathers before me, so it will come upon me, I will make account of it, and therefore <hi>I will waite all my dayes:</hi> So should we, make account every day, that this may bee the day of my change; in every thing you doe, make account that your change may begin then in that very action, and this will be a meanes to make you <hi>waite for your change,</hi> make you prepare for death. It is that that <hi>Drusius</hi> noteth of <hi>Rabbi Eleazer,</hi> that he gave this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14764:28"/>
and advise, that <hi>a man should be sure to repent one day before he died.</hi> Hee meant not that a man should deferre his repentance till it did evidently appeare, that Death had seized upon him: But, because a man may conclude, if it be possible I may live to day, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable I may die to morrow, therefore I will repent to day. Doe it now, and doe not delay it till to morrow.</p>
                  <p>This is that we are to doe, to account of every day, as that <note place="margin">Three things wherein there is to be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of death to a man.</note> which may be the day of our change, and so to carrie our selves in all our actions and occasions, as if wee should have no more time to doe our worke. And this is especially to be observed in three things.</p>
                  <p>First, in matter of sinning, be carefull to amend sinne every <note place="margin">1. In matter of sinning.</note> day, labour to mortifie sinne this day, as if thou shouldest have no more dayes to mortifie it in, take heed of sinning now, as if thou shouldest die now. Some we see have beene taken away in the very act of sinne: <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> were taken away in the <note place="margin">Acts 5.</note> very act of sinning, when they were telling a lie to the Apostle they died: <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Corbie</hi> were slaine in the very act of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, they died in the act of murmuring, and resisting of God, and his ordinances, and ministers. Let a man now reason with himselfe, these were taken away in their sinnes, it may be my case aswell as theirs, if I be found in sinne. That is the first.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, bring it home to this particularalso, in another case, <note place="margin">2. In redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the time of life:</note> and that is, in redeeming of the opportunities of the time of our life. Besides, the generall time of life, there be certaine opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, certaine advantages of time, that the Scripture calleth sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: be carefull to redeeme them: though you may enjoy your lives, yet you may have none of these; such as are seasons of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying God, seasons of doing good, seasons of gaining good to a mans selfe, be carefull therefore (I say) to mannage those oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, and advantages of time, so that you may glorifie God: <hi>Whether you eate or drinke, or whatsoever you doe, doe all to the glory of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 35.</note> 
                     <hi>God.</hi> Which way soever you may most advance Gods glory, and promote his worship, which way soever yee may promote the cause of God, drawing men to God, and incouraging them in the wayes of God, which way soever you may bee usefull, employ your selfe at that time, the present time, because you must die, and you may die now, you may have no more opportunities to doe it in. And so likewise in all advantages, wherein men may doe good to men, <hi>Exhort one another while it is called to day, and while you have</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 13. Gal. 6. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>time doe good unto all:</hi> Doe all the spirituall good, and all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good that you can, while you have seasons to doe good. <hi>Happy is that servant, that his Master shall find so doing, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,</hi> leading a fruitfull and profitable life. So, doe good to your
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14764:29"/>
owne soules while you have time: pray, while you have time to pray, heare the Word, while you have time to heare it: exercise repentance, while you have time to repent: perfect the worke of mortification, while you have time to mortifie your corruptions: doe your soules all the good you can, by the advantages of all the ordinances, of all the opportunities that God hath given you. This is the end of all men: it hath been the end of good and bad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and it shall be the end of good and bad now; men must die, their houses will be <hi>houses of mourning,</hi> therefore mannage the time in doing all the good you can, that God may be glorified, men may be benefited, and your owne soules furthered; That is the second thing.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, in the manner of your conversation, consider the time that <note place="margin">3. In the manner of our conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> you have to doe every thing in. Will a man be found idleing in the market-place, when hee should be working in the Vineyard? Would you be feasting, when God would have you mourning? you shall see some that have beene taken away, when they little thought of it: <hi>Belshazzer,</hi> he was in his feasts, and then commeth the sentence of death against him, and other the like examples you may see in the Scripture. Consider therefore the particular actions that you doe, whether they bee such as hold agreement with the state of a dying man. So for the manner of doing holy duties. Would you be found praying perfunctorily, and careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Would you be found comming to the Sacrament unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? What though you doe holy actions, that are good for the matter, would you be found doing of them, with unfit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared hearts? You see what the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. For this cause many are sicke, and weake, and many sleepe:</hi> they slept, they were dead for this, even because they came unworthily to receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. Would you therefore bee found doing of holy duties, and not in a right manner? The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious consideration of this, that <hi>Death is the end of all men,</hi> with the particular application of it to a mans selfe, that as it is the state of all men, so it is mine in particular, I must die, and I may die now; it hath an influence into all the actions of a mans life.</p>
                  <p>To conclude. In the last place; This point is of use to us, also <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. In respect of the death of others.</note> in the death of others.</p>
                  <p>First, to moderate the mourning of Christians for the death of others. Why? It is <hi>the end of all men,</hi> it is that that is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">1. To mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our mourning for the death of others.</note> condition of all men, it should not be too grievous, nor too dolefull to any man. Wee would not have our friends to bee in another condition in their birth then others, wee would not have them have more fingers, or more members then a man, and would wee have them have more dayes? Let this serve as a briefe touch upon that.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14764:29"/>
Secondly, it teacheth us to make good use of our fellowship <note place="margin">2. To im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the life of others.</note> while we are together. Not only we may die, but those that are usefull to us may die also: let us make good use of one another, while we live therefore. This will make the death of others bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and will be worse then the death, and losse of our friends, the guilt upon a mans conscience, that hee hath not made that use of them while they were alive, that he might have done: let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make the death of our friends easie, by making good use of them while they live. It did smite the heart of those Ephesians, that they <hi>should see the face of Paul no more,</hi> specially above the rest it grieved them, that they should see him no more, how would it have grieved them thinke you, if they had alwayes hardned themselves against his ministrie before? Thinke with your selves seriously, here is such a Minister, such a Christian friend, that hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife, that parent and child, a time of parting will come; let us make it easie now, by making good use of one another while we live, that when friends are tooke away, we may have cause to thanke God, that we have had communion, and comfort of their fellowship and societie, the benefit of their graces, the fruit of their lives: and not sorrow for the want of them by death. So much for that.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the second, and principall reason, why it is <hi>better to goe to the house of mourning, then to the house of feasting,</hi> it is this, <hi>because the living shall lay it to his heart,</hi> What shall <hi>hee lay to his heart? That that is the end of all men,</hi> hee shall lay the death of men to heart.</p>
                  <p>The point I observe from hence is thus much.</p>
                  <p>It is the dutie of those that live, to lay to heart the death <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obser.</hi> 3. It is the duty of the living, to lay to heart the death of others.</note> of others.</p>
                  <p>That is, seriously to consider, and make use for themselves of the death of others. You see the Text is cleare for the point. And there is good reason why it should be so.</p>
                  <p>First, in respect of the glory that commeth to God. <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in respect of the good that commeth to our selves by it. First, God is glorified by this, when wee lay to heart the <note place="margin">1. God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by it.</note> death of others: there is a dishonour done to God, when wee slight the death of others, good or bad. It is a dishonour to God to slight any of his actions: this is one of Gods workes in the world, the death of men: this is a thing wherein Gods hand is seene: he saith to the sonnes of <hi>Adam, Returne. The spirit returneth to God that gave it.</hi> It is <hi>hee that hath the power of life and death.</hi> If a <hi>sparrow fall not to the ground, without the providence of God;</hi> much lesse the servants of God, the precious ones upon the earth, the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14764:30"/>
                     <hi>excellent ones,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> calleth them. I say, God is seene much in these workes, and it is a great dishonour to God, when men doe not consider the workes of his hands: <hi>David</hi> by the spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie in <hi>Psal. 28. 5. wisheth a curse upon ungodly men,</hi> and for this <note place="margin">Psal. 28. 5.</note> reason among the rest, <hi>because they consider not the operation of his hands:</hi> this is that that puts men into a curst estate, and exposeth them to the wrath of God, when they <hi>regard not the workes of the Lord.</hi> The actions of Princes, and great men upon earth, every man considereth of them, and weigheth them: It is that, wherein wee give God the glory of his wisedome, and of his truth, of his power, of his justice, of his mercy, of his soveraigntie and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and Lordship over the whole earth, when wee labour to draw to a particular use to ourselves, the workes of God in the world, specially the death of men, of all men, good and bad, for we must give it the same latitude, and extent, and scope that the Text doth here: he speakes here of the death of men in generall, and he saith of all men, that their <hi>death shall bee laid to heart by the living.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, as there is reason that we should take to heart the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Our selves are benefited by it.</note> death of others, in respect of the glory that commeth to God thereby: so in respect of ourselves also, much benefit commeth to ourselves, by laying to heart the death of other men. There be three speciall things considerable in the death of any one, that is matter of profit, and benefit to those that live, and survive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them.</p>
                  <p>Therein we see the <list>
                        <item>certainty</item>
                        <item>nature</item>
                        <item>cause and end</item>
                     </list> of Death.</p>
                  <p>First, therein we see the certainty of death: For now we have not only the word of God that tels us that we shall die, but the <note place="margin">2. Thereby we come to see the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of death.</note> workes of God taking others before us: that as the Sacraments are called Visible instructions, because they teach by the eye, and the outward senses: so the death of others are visible instructions to the living, it teacheth by the eye: a man is guided by the eye, to see his owne condition, and as it were in a glasse, there is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to him his owne state: what we are, they were once: the time was that they converst with men as we doe, that they spake for Gods glory upon earth as we doe; and what they are now we shall be, there will come a time when our workes shall cease as theirs doe, when we shall be in the <hi>place of silence,</hi> as they are. I say, it confirmeth to us the former certaintie, and assurance of our death, when we see others fall before us. And there is great profit and benefit that ariseth out of this. This is necessary to awaken mens drowsinesse, and to quicken up mens dulnesse to a serious
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14764:30"/>
consideration of that that is so usefull to themselves. A man would wonder, that in the Wildernesse, where so many thousands died, (for the hand of God was out against them, for their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and rebellion, and they were destroyed by the destroyer, as the Apostle speakes 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.) that there <hi>Moses</hi> should pray, <hi>Lord teach us to number our dayes, that wee may apply our hearts to wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi> though they had a sight of so many dying before them, and that continually, yet they needed to bee stirred up to pray, that God would teach them to make use of it. So it is with us. Wee have seene not only one or two die before us, but there was a time not long since (and you cannot forget it) wherein the destroying Angel did walke at libertie about the Citie, and kill thousands in our streets, yet when so many died, what securitie was there even among those that lived? insomuch, that after a while the sicknesse grew common, and usuall, and so, unregarded. Have we not need then as much as ever <hi>Moses</hi> had in the Wildernesse, to crie to God, <hi>to teach us to number our dayes, that wee may apply our hearts to wisedome?</hi> Nay, much more now, when there is scarce one, or none, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of those multitudes that were swept away in that visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we have need of such helpes as these are, and to joyne our prayers with them too, that we may be stirred up to a serious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it to our selves. That's the first thing, it is necessary for living men to take to heart the death of those that are depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they may see, and be brought seriously to thinke of the certainty of their owne death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, therein also wee see the nature of death, what the <note place="margin">2. Thereby we come to see the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of death.</note> proper worke of it in the world is; It is of singular use too. The nature of death, the proper worke of it, is to disunite, to separate, to dis-joyne things: here you have the soule separated from the body: the estate separated from the man; the man separated from <note place="margin">The proper worke of death.</note> his friends, and all by Death. First (I say) yee have the body se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the soule: and this is a usefull consideration. The <note place="margin">1. To sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the body from the soule.</note> soule and the body, while they keepe together in a man, they may be helpfull, and usefull one to another; the time will come when they must be separated. Alas! the not considering of this, is the cause of those great errours, that are in the lives of men: that they bestow so much time upon their bodies, that they so much minde the present things of this life, and their outward welfare, as if they had no soules at all to regard; as if there never should bee a separation of body and soule one from another. What is the reason that there is all that care tooke, for food for the body? for apparell for the body? for health for the body? and such an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter neglect of the soule? but because that men doe not dreame, doe not thinke of a time of separation, of a time of dis-junction, of a time of parting these two. All the worke of a mans life,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14764:31"/>
should now be to make a good use of the faculties of his soule, that the body may be happy by it: the soule will draw the body after it to its owne estate. Now they are together, if they joyne now in sinne: after their separation, there shall come a time, when they shall be joyned in punishment: if they joyne now in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God; after they have beene separated a while by death, there will come a time, when they shall be againe joyned in glory and happinesse. That is the first; There will bee a separation of soule and body: therefore make good use of them, while they are together: let the body be serviceable to the soule, by all its senses and members: let the soule rule, and order the body, by its under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and affections, &amp;c. that both body and soule may bee made blessed in an eternall conjunction together after death, and in an everlasting union in the sight of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Death makes a separation betweene a man, and all <note place="margin">2. To sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a man from his estate.</note> his outward estate in the world. The rich man in Saint <hi>Luke</hi> 12. thought not upon this: <hi>Soule, thou hast much goods layed up for many yeares;</hi> hee thought his soule, and his goods, should never have parted, <hi>therefore take now thine ease,</hi> saith he. See what the end of it was; <hi>Thou foole</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>this night they shall fetch away thy soule, and then whose shall these things bee?</hi> The time is comming, that these things shall bee none of thine, they shall bee another mans, they shall be some bodies else, they shall be taken from thee. How necessary is this consideration, to take off mens affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from the world, and to stirre them up to use their wealth, and their estates, while they have them, so as may make for the glory of God? A time shall come, that they shall not have it to use, that nothing shall be left them, but a bare account to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up, <hi>Give an account of thy stewardship, Luke</hi> 16. The maine busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is now to be done, while a man and his wealth are together, while a man and his estate continueth together, to use it to Gods glory, otherwise it will be a woefull, and heavy parting, when death shall come to make a separation. The young man went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way sorrowfull, when Christ would have his wealth from him, because he had great possessions. How sorrowfull will a man goe out of the world, when he hath a great deale of wealth, but he hath not prepared his account, he cannot give up a reckoning of his getting of it, of his using and imploying of it? It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary therefore (I say) that men take to heart the death of those that die before them, that when they see the bodies, and soules of men parted, men and their estates parted, they may learne how to use their bodies and soules, themselves and their estates, while they are yet joyned together.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Death doth not only part a mans body and soule, a <note place="margin">3. To sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a man from his friends.</note> mans selfe and his wealth, but it parteth a man from his friends,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14764:31"/>
from all his worldly acquaintance, from all those that he tooke delight in upon earth: Deathmakes a separation betweene hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife: see it in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> though <hi>Abraham</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Sarah</hi> dearely, yet Death parted them, <hi>Let me have a place to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>burie my dead out of my sight.</hi> It parteth father and child, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing soever they be: see it in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Absolom, Oh Absolom, my sonne, would God I had died for thee:</hi> and <hi>Rachel mourned for her children, and would not be comforted, because they were not.</hi> It parteth the Minister and the people: see it in the case of the people of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels lamenting the death of <hi>Samuel;</hi> and in the case of the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, at the parting of S. <hi>Paul, sorrowing especially when they heard they should see his face no more.</hi> It parteth those friends who were so united together in love, as if they had but one soule in two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; see it in the separation that was made by death, betweene <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> that were so knit together in their love, that <note place="margin">2 Sam. 1. 9.</note> he bewaileth him, <hi>Woe is mee for my brother Ionathan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a necessary consideration for us that live, that wee may learne to know how to carrie our selves towards our wordly friends, and how to moderate our selves in our enjoyment of these worldly comforts. Looke upon every worldly thing as a mortall, as a dying comfort. Looke upon children and friends, as dying comforts. Look upon your estates, as that that hath wings, and will be gone. Looke upon your bodies, that now you make so much of, as a thing that must bee parted from the soule by death, and that ere long.</p>
                  <p>See what advise the Apostle giveth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 19. the time is <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 19.</note> short (saith he) therefore <hi>let those that marry, bee as if they married not: and they that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not: and they that buy, as though they possessed not: and they that use this world as not abusing it.</hi> A man abuseth the world, when he useth it beyond the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the shortnesse of enjoying these things: when hee lookes upon these things, as things that hee shall enjoy alwayes. But if we would use it aright, looke upon things, as things that we shall enjoy, but for a short time. This body that seemeth now to have some beautie in it, yet it must die, and be laied in the dust: these friends that seeme now to haue some pleasure, and delight in them, yet I must die, and be tooke from them: this estate and wealth, that now I set so much prize upon, I must die, and death will part me and it. So I say, lookeupon every thing as separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from us.</p>
                  <p>Moderate your affections likewise to them. Vse them onely as comforts in the way, as a traveller doth the pleasures of his Inne, hee stands not to build himselfe houses against every pleasant walke he lookes upon, he stands not to purchase lands, and to lay them to every Inne he comes to lie at; No, he knowes that he is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14764:32"/>
now but in his passage, in his way, he knowes that hee is not at home, that is the place he is going to, and after a time hee shall come thither. So make account that you are not now at home, it is death that must helpe you to your home. Let this therefore take you off from all these things that are in the way.</p>
                  <p>It is a strange thing, to see how Sathan besotteth, and befoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth men. They strive, and labour to compasse many worldly things, as if their happinesse stood in the enjoyment of them, as if they should have their wealth, and their comforts for ever. What care is there amongst men to get wealth, and many times lose their soules in getting the world? Alas! Death will part, soule and body, them and their wealth and all. Doe wee not see this daily in the death of others before us: such a one is dead, where is his body now? in the dust. Where are his friends, and his companions now? Where is his wealth and his estate, for which many flattered him, and fawned upon him? are they not all separated from him? they have nothing now to doe with him: he cannot dispose of one penny of his estate now, it is left he knowes not to whom, others now have the mannaging of it. As now you can say this of others, so there will a time come, that other men will say the like of you, I had such a friend, but death hath parted him from me, hee had such an estate, but death hath parted him and his estate. Let us therefore make this use of the death of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to conclude with our selves, that there will be a parting of all those outward things, that now wee are so apt to dote upon.</p>
                  <p>The third speciall thing considerable in the death of others, that will be matter of profit, and benefit to those that live, and <note place="margin">3. Thereby we come to see the end, and cause of death.</note> survive after them is, the end and cause for which God sendeth Death abroad into the world with such a large commission, that it goeth on with such libertie to every familie, to every place, that it seizeth upon every person. What's the reason of it?</p>
                  <p>You shall see in the severall deaths of men, severall causes. There is judgement and mercy; sometime a mixture of both, and sometime but of one of these.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes, wee see an apparant judgement of God in the death of some.</p>
                  <p>A judgement of God upon themselves. Thus the young Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet that disobeyed the word of the Lord, a Lyon met him in the way and slew him. So those Corinths, that <hi>did eate and drinke unworthily in the Lords Supper,</hi> though they were such as were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved after, yet neverthelesse <hi>for this very cause</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>some of them were sicke and weake, and some slept, they died, they were judged of the Lord, that they might not bee condemned with the world.</hi> When you see death seizing upon men, as an act of divine judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of divine displeasure, let it make you more fearefull of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14764:32"/>
against God, lest you provoke against your selves the same wrath, in the very act of sinne.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes againe it is a judgement of God upon others. Thus God takes away divers of his servants, because the world is not worthy of them.</p>
                  <p>And as this is an act of judgement upon the world, so it is an act of mercie to them; God in mercy taking of them away from the evill to come, and from the evill present. A judgement of God to others that are unworthy of them: A mercie to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they are tooke away, from their owne evill; from sinne, from temptations, from all the effects and fruits of sinne; and taken away from the evill that is to come upon others.</p>
                  <p>An act (I say) of mercie to them. So it was to the child of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,</hi> he should die, and should not see the judgement that was to come upon his fathers house, <hi>because there was found some good</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 14. 13 2 Chro. 34. 28</note> 
                     <hi>thing in him toward the Lord.</hi> So it was to <hi>Iosiah, Hee should bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to his fathers in peace, and his eyes should not see all that evill which the Lord would bring upon Ierusalem, and upon the inhabitants thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An act of judgement to others. <hi>Righteous and mercifull men are</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 57. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>taken away, and noman layeth it to heart:</hi> they consider not the causes wherefore God takes away those good men. A Land, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, a State, a People, a place is much weakned, when those that are righteous, and mercifull men; when those that stand in the gappe, and use their endevours to prevent judgements, are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. The house will certainly fall, when the pillars are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. They are the people of God only, that hold up a state; that hold up the world. Assoone as <hi>Noah</hi> is put into the Arke, presently commeth the deluge upon the World. Assoone as ever <hi>Lot</hi> was got up to <hi>Zoar,</hi> presently the Lord rained downe fire and brimstone upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> Assoone as ever the mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are marked, presently commeth the destroying Angell upon <note place="margin">Ezek. 9. 4. 5.</note> the rest.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, when wee see those that are mourners for the evils of the times, and places where they live tooke away, we should lay it to heart, and consider it as a signe of Gods displeasure, as a signe that hee is a going, and departing, when he takes away his jewels, as a signe that he is a comming to judge the world, when hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to separate, to take to himselfe his owne. Certainly, as soone as ever that number of the elect shall bee accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, when the company of those that God hath determined to eternall life shall be fulfilled, when the sheepe of Christ, that are yet to be brought into his fold, are gathered together, when the fulnesse of the Gentiles is come in, and the nation of the <hi>Iewes</hi> added, then the world shall bee burnt with fire, and the day of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14764:33"/>
Iudgement shall come, nothing shall hinder that generall destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that shall be the end of all things here below. As it is with the generall Iudgement of the world, so with particular Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Nations, when God takes away his people, when the Saints goe out of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to <hi>Pila,</hi> then commeth the sword of the enemie upon <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> when God drawes out his owne people, presently commeth judgement upon the rest. It is good to observe Gods method and order, that he takes in governing of the world at this day, that in the death of the servants of God, wee may consider our owne time, that wee may prepare for those evils that are a comming, and for those greater judgements that are hastning.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see what use may bee made of laying to heart the death of others; God is much glorified thereby. For all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes are seene in all his workes, and the glorifying of God, is a declaring of God to be as glorious, as hee hath revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be in his attributes, which is, by shewing of them forth in his workes. When men can see the wisedome, the justice, the power, the mercie, the truth, the soveraigntie of God, and all in the death of others, then they glorifie God in taking to heart the death of others.</p>
                  <p>You see likewise what good commeth to a mans selfe by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to heart the death of others. He sees thereby the certainty of his owne death. He sees the nature of death, and what the proper worke of it is, <hi>viz.</hi> to separate betweene him and all those out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts, all those props and staies whereupon his heart rested too much on earth, in the daies of his vanitie. And lastly, he sees the end, and cause, why God sendeth Death into the world: sometime in judgement, that men should take heed of sin: sometime in mercie; in mercy to the men themselves, and in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy also to those that live, that they seeing the servants of God lodged up before the tempest, may learne to feare, and to hide and secure themselves under Gods speciall providence, who can either hide them amongst the living, or the dead, in the worst times.</p>
                  <p>Now let us conclude with some application to our selves. In <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. For reproofe of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall neglect of this duty.</note> the first place, it serveth for the just reproofe of that great neglect that is in the world at this day, <hi>that men lay not to heart the death of others.</hi> I wish that this were only the sinne of worldly men. I know to a worldly man it is of all things the most unpleasant thought that can be to thinke of death: hee cannot endure to heare this, <hi>they shall fetch thy soule from thee.</hi> It is as unpleasant to him, as it is to a bankrout to heare of a Sergeant comming to arrest him: as unpleasant as it is to a malefactour to heare of being brought before the Iudge. And that is the reason why men in the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14764:33"/>
time of feasting, cannot endure such discourses at their Tables, as might put sad thoughts of death into them; oh! these are to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy thoughts. Yea, but in the meane time it is thy folly, thy want of wisedome. Hee that was guided by the spirit of wisedome, and had now bought some wisedome at a deare rate, by wofull experience of his former follies; hee now seeth that it was farre better to goe to the house of mourning, that is, seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to consider of that, which men account the most ordinary cause of mourning, that is, the death of others, and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: then to goe to the house of feasting, that is, to sport a mans selfe in the pleasures of the world, and to give libertie to a mans selfe to all manner of delights.</p>
                  <p>But (I say) I wish that this were their fault onely, and that it may die with them. But it is too much the fault of Gods owne people. <hi>Moses</hi> is faine to pray for <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wildernesse, where they saw so many die before them, <hi>that God would give them wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to number their dayes.</hi> And Ministers have still the same cause to pray for the people, and Christians to pray one for another, that God would give them wisedome to lay to heart the death of other men.</p>
                  <p>Have you well considered of Death, when you can only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, that such a one that was profitable in his instruction, is dead: such a one by whom we have had good in conversing with, is dead, such a one that was young, and likely to live many yeares longer, is dead? What of all this? this is but idle, and emptie discourse. What use makest thou of this to thy selfe? dost thou gather from thence the certaintie of thy owne death? Dost thou consider what Death will doe to thee when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth? how that it will separate betweene thee and all things in the world, as it hath done them. Dost thou consider for what cause God sendeth Death abroad into the world? Dost thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider this with thy selfe, as thou oughtest to doe? This is an act of wisedome. This is that wee call due consideration, when the soule reflects upon it selfe; it is their case now, and it will be mine, and mine in the same manner, therefore it is good for me, to set my accounts straite with God. When thou accompaniest ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the grave, dost thou conclude thus with thyselfe, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next time that any death is spoken of, it may bee mine? or as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speakes to <hi>Saphira</hi> after the death of <hi>Annanias, The feet of those that have buried thy husband are at the doore, and shall carrie thee out also?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the reason of all that worldly-mindednesse, of all that earnestnesse, and intention, to gaine the favour of men by indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect meanes, this is the reason of all that immoderate care about our businesse with the neglect of our soules, this is the reason of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14764:34"/>
all that carnall securitie, of all that forgetfulnesse of God, and the account that shall be made at the day of Iudgement, this is the reason of the unfruitfulnesse of our lives, of our unprofitable spending of our times, or of whatsoever else it be, this is even the very reason of all, because even those that professe themselves to be the people of God, and to give God the glory of his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes in all his workes, yet they lay not to heart the death of those that are before them. Men durst not, they could not, passe away their time in such unprofitablenesse, and unfruitfulnesse as they doe, if they did seriously consider, and lay to heart, the death of others before them</p>
                  <p>Againe secondly; As it condemnes the generall neglect that is <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. For reproofe.</note> amongst men of this dutie, so it serves to reproue, that sinfull laying to heart of the death of others, that is too frequent and common in the world. <note place="margin">1. Of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for dead friends.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, first, when men with too much fondnesse, and with too great excesse and distemper of affection, looke upon their dead friends, as if God could never repaire the losse, nor make amends for that he hath done in taking of them away. <hi>Rachel mourneth, and will not bee comforted. David</hi> mourneth, and will scarce bee comforted, <hi>Oh Absalom, my sonne, my sonne, would God I had died for thee.</hi> What is all this, but to looke on friends, rather as Gods then men, as if all sufficiencie were included in them only? Men looke on their friends, as <hi>Micah</hi> did upon his Idoll, when they had bereaved him of it, they took away all his comfort and quiet, <hi>You have taken away my Gods</hi> (saith hee) <hi>and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Judg. 8. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>what have I more?</hi> or as <hi>Laban,</hi> that when his Idols were stolne away, his heart was dead, hee could not stay in his house, hee could not enjoy himselfe, <hi>wherefore have you stollen away my gods?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>. 30.</note> saith hee. So, I say, men looke on their dead friends as they should looke upon the Creatour, and not as upon the creature: they take their death to heart, but not in a right manner.</p>
                  <p>This is the very reason why God many times makes your Christian friends so unprofitable to you when they live, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you idolize them, you advance them above God.</p>
                  <p>This is the reason also, why you are so unable to beare the losse of them when they die, God beating you now with your owne rodde, and making you feele the fruit and effect of your owne folly. This now is an ill taking to heart the death of friends, to mourne as men without hope.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a taking to heart, and considering of the <note place="margin">2. Of the rash censuring of the manner of others death.</note> death of men, but it is an unrighteous considering, an unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judging of the death of others. If men see one die, it may bee a violent death, then they conclude, certainly there is some apparent token of Gods judgement on such a one. If they see
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14764:34"/>
another die, with some extremitie of torment, and vehement paines, certainly there is some apparant evidence of Gods wrath upon this man. If they see another in some great and violent tentation, strugling against many tentations, they conclude pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, certainly such are in worser case then others. I may say to all these, as Christ said once to those that told him of the eighteene men upon whom the tower in <hi>Siloe</hi> fell, thinke you that <hi>they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Hierusalem?</hi> Or rather as <note place="margin">Luke 13. 4. Eccles. 9. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, All things come alike unto all, there <hi>is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the cleane, and to the uncleane; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is the sinner, and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.</hi> Learne to judge righteous judgement, to judge wisely of the death of others, take heed of condemning the generation of the just.</p>
                  <p>But rather, in the last place. Make this use of the death of every <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3. For instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> one. Doth such a man die by an ordinary sicknesse, having his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and memorie continued to the end? Doth such a man die in inward peace and comfort, with cleare and evident appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of Gods love, so that he can with <hi>Simeon</hi> say, <hi>Lord now</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 2. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>lettest thou thy servant depart in peace?</hi> What use shouldest thou that livest make of this now? Certainly, let the sweetnesse of their death, make thee in love with the goodnesse of their lives. That is the only way to a happy death, to a comfortable end in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the leading of a fruitfull and profitable life.</p>
                  <p>Againe, dost thou see the children of God full of temptations, full of feares and disquietnesse of spirit in their death? Sometimes so overcome with the violence of the disease, as that (it may be) they speake impertinently and idlely, it may bee sinfully? What use shouldest thou make of this now? Certainly let the terrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the example of such a mans death, let it bee a terrour to thee, and a meanes to stirre thee up to more carefulnesse of making good use of thy time in this life. <hi>Nabal</hi> dieth, <hi>and his heart is in him as a stone.</hi> If ever God quicken thee, if ever God breath upon thy soule, or enliven thee by the inward motions of his Spirit, embrace those opportunities, and seasons of grace, lest God smite thee with an everlasting deadnesse. Againe, hath God caused the light of his countenance to shine upon thy heart? Doth hee offer a gracious message of peace to thy soule? Doth hee speake peace at any time by the ministerie of his Word? Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace those offers, yeeld to those conditions of peace, lest thou bee deprived of peace at the end. Againe, hath GOD given thee any strength over temptations? Hast thou prevailed over the assaults of Sathan, and other of thy enemies? Hath hee made thee a conquerour? take heed how thou insnarest thy selfe againe, how thou inthrallest thy selfe in yeelding to Sathans
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14764:35"/>
yoke, lest hee buffet thee by him in a worse manner at thy end.</p>
                  <p>Thus (I say) thou canst see nothing befall any of GODS servants in their death, or in the manner of their death, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee more pleasing, or more sorrowfull; more calme and quiet, or more tempestuous, and full of trouble; whether it bee more comfortable, or more lamentable, but it may be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto thee. If it bee good, it may bee it shall bee so with thee; if it be bad, it may bee it shall bee so with thee too. The maine businesse that a man hath to doe, is to make sure of himselfe in this life. It was the question that Saint <hi>Austin</hi> made to those that told him of a violent death that seized upon one. <hi>But how did he live?</hi> (saith hee.) He made no matter how he went out, but how he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himselfe in the world. And truly this is the great Question, that every man should put to his soule. I must out of the world, how have I lived when I was in the world? had GOD any glory by mee? had men any good by me? have I furthered my account against the day of reckoning, that I may give it up with joy? it makes no matter how I goe out of the world, I am sure if my life have beene serviceable to God, and beneficiall to men, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture shall be for gaine and advantage, it is for a better world.</p>
                  <p>Thus much shall serve briefly for the opening of these words, and for that that is appliable from them.</p>
                  <p>For the present occasion a word.</p>
                  <p>Funerall Sermons are not intended for the praise of the dead, but for the comfort of the living. Therefore I have chosen such an argument to handle at this time, as might bee of use, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to you that live. Besides that, I am in particular, and by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular order, debarred of speaking any thing concerning our deceased Sister, though I might have spoken much, and that very usefull to you. The best use that you can make will bee this, to consider the life that shee led amongst you. Shee was a patterne, and example of holinesse, of a wise and upright carriage in her wayes: follow her in that: <hi>Marke the Godly and upright man, the end of that man is peace.</hi> There was none that knew her, but upon good assurance are perswaded of her happinesse now. Would you then have the same happinesse after? take the same course that shee did, be much in prayer, and dependance upon the ordinances, and in fellowship with the servants of God; be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in doing good, profitable in receiving good: mannage the opportunities and times well that God giveth you, as she did, gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning much in little: she did much worke in a short space: let that be your care, and then this will be your comfort in the end. Thus if you make this use of the death of others before you, you shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for your own death, and that shalbe only a passage for you to Eternall life.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The persons that are kept under this <hi>feare,</hi> are said to bee the <hi>children;</hi> Gods owne children, those for whom Christ died, yet they were <hi>kept under the feare of death,</hi> and that not at some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular time, when tentation had got some speciall advantage over them, but it was a trouble, and a burden to them <hi>all their life long,</hi> and that not a small burthen, or an easie trouble, but such as kept them as <hi>in bondage.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Observat.</hi> Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the feare of death.</note> 
                     <hi>bloud</hi> (it is taken either for the humane nature, or the infirmities of that nature) even these children were <hi>held under the feare of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will shew the grounds of it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>feare of death</hi> in the children of God, ariseth either from some causes without, or from somewhat within them.</p>
                  <p>From without them, and so the feare ariseth from God, an act <note place="margin">The outward causes of the feare of death.</note> of his providence upon his children.</p>
                  <p>Or from Sathan, a worke of his malice. These are the causes from without.</p>
                  <p>For the first, God in his providence, and that in his speciall and <note place="margin">1. God.</note> fatherly providence, whereby he doth order all things for the good of his children, for the present increase of their grace, and the fitting them for glory hereafter; Hee (I say) in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ordereth it thus, that they shall be kept (many of them) a great while <hi>under the feare of death,</hi> and this he doth for speciall good ends.</p>
                  <p>The first is, to humble them. <note place="margin">To humble his children.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> as soone as he had sinned against God, as his fall was by pride (he would haue had a higher condition then he was in) so when God would bring him backe againe, he beginneth first to humble him: and how doth he that? <hi>Dust thou art</hi> (saith he) <hi>and to dust thou shalt returne:</hi> he sheweth him, that he was a dead man by sinne, and so would have the meditation of death to humble <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him all his posteritie after him.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>David,</hi> when he desired that some meanes might worke upon his enemies for their good, he prayeth, <hi>Put them in feare, that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 9. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>they may know that they are but men:</hi> He doth not onely pray that mortalitie might be presented to them, but so presented, that it might leaue an impression of <hi>feare</hi> upon their affections, that they might know what they are, that they have not their beeing, or the power of subsisting in themselves, but that they must looke for it above themselves, to <hi>him that hath the issues of life and death</hi> in his owne hande.</p>
                  <p>And this is necessarie, that all the servants of God should bee kept humble by some meanes or other. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> (you see) he had attained a great measure of grace, yet he standeth in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:14764:37"/>
need of something to humble him, <hi>therefore the messenger of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>was sent to buffet him, that hee should not bee exalted above measure,</hi> that he might be kept humble.</p>
                  <p>God intendeth to raise up his children to a glorious estate, therefore as men lay a low foundation, when they intend to erect a high building; so God layeth the foundation, of all grace and comfort in his servants, in humiliation: therefore he will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have them mortall, but he will have them apprehend their mortalitie, and dying condition with <hi>feare,</hi> that they may be humbled by this feare. That is the first thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God aymeth at the strengthning of faith in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. <note place="margin">To streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their faith.</note> While a man lookes to sense, and is upheld by sensible comforts, there is not that exercise of faith: now every grace is strengthened by exercise, that God therefore may have faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised, and so strengthned in his servants, he will expose them to the <hi>feare of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> found this: <hi>wee received</hi> (faith he) the <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 9. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>of death, that wee might not trust in our selves, but in him that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth us up from the dead.</hi> Hee doth not onely say thus, we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this to be a truth, that we must die, but <hi>wee received the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death,</hi> received it as a man receiveth a sentence of death from a Judge, received it so, as it made some impression upon our hearts, received it with some inward sense, with some inward feare: which was a violent worke, such a worke as knocks us off of all holds, and takes us off from all sensible, and visible props, and humane supports, and makes us to see nothing in the creature to doe us that good we looke for, to make us eternally happy: therefore we were taught (saith he) <hi>not to trust in our selves;</hi> if a man trust any, he might trust himselfe first; yea, but wee are dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and cannot enjoy our selves long, therefore <hi>wee trust in him that raiseth us up from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, another end that God aymeth at, in holding his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <note place="margin">To encrease their watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse.</note> many times <hi>under the feare of death,</hi> is, that hee may make them more watchfull, and holy in the course of their lives.</p>
                  <p>This our Saviour expresseth under two parables, the one of <note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> the <hi>Virgins</hi> that were to <hi>watch</hi> for the comming of the <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome,</hi> they knew that he would come, but they knew not when, therefore they were alwayes to keepe their <hi>watch, with oyle in their lampes.</hi> And the other of a Master, that left Talents with his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he told them that hee would come, but hee told them not when, that they might be sure to employ them to the best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                  <p>And the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> raiseth an exhortation to this purpose, on this very ground: <hi>Since</hi> (saith he) <hi>that all these things must bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>what manner of persons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ght we to be in all holy conversation and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:14764:38"/>
godlinesse, looking for, and hastning to the appearance of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> We know that the Lord Jesus Christ will come, but hee hath concealed the particular time of his comming, that wee might alwayes keepe our watch, and be prepared for him, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he commeth.</p>
                  <p>Now, this is necessary for all the servants of God, for they are apt to be secure, and to be carried away with worldly busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and delights, and to neglect that which concernes their eternall good, and therefore God will affect them with the <hi>feare of death,</hi> that they may be stirred up to more watchfulnesse and holinesse, in a godly course of life.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God doth it, that by the feare of Death they may <note place="margin">To prepare them for death.</note> be better prepared for death, that it may not come upon them as a stranger, that they never thought on before, that it may not <hi>come as an armed man</hi> upon them: therefore is it that God will have them, not onely to have thoughts of it, but <hi>feare</hi> of it; <hi>feare</hi> (you know) is an affection, that quickneth a man to action, keepes him to a constant observing of God. <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> when God did not onely bring a multitude of enemies upon him, but <note place="margin">2 Chro. 20. 3.</note> also sent the report of them to him, and that in such a manner, as he might be affected with <hi>feare;</hi> What did all this worke in him? The text saith; <hi>Iehosaphat did seeke the Lord with all his heart, and proclaimed a fast in Iudah,</hi> and <hi>provided such other defence,</hi> as was necessarie; he saw nothing but feare and danger in the creature, <hi>Wee know not what to doe with this great company, that commeth against us,</hi> this set him aworke to <hi>seeke the Lord with all his heart,</hi> and to make other provision against them. So the Lord will have his servants apprehend death as an <hi>Armed</hi> enemie comming upon them, that they may be better prepared to receive it, that they may get evidences of comfort, and assurance of heaven, and so may be fitted upon good grounds to entertaine death with joy when it commeth.</p>
                  <p>And this the servants of God have need of, because if there be not somewhat to quicken to this, there are other things enough to pervert them from it: and then when men are most weake, and full of paine and wearinesse, the divell takes advantage to cast them off from all comfort, so that at the least they shall die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortably; if not miserably, if they be not prepared before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to receive Death, and have gotten assurance, and evidence of a better condition afterward.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have the first thing, that is, Gods act, and for what reasons hee keepeth his servants in this <hi>bondage of the feare of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe secondly, another cause from without, is from the malice of Sathan. His maine aime is, to keepe men from a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <note place="margin">2. Sathan.</note>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:14764:38"/>
course altogether: if that cannot be done; his next worke is to make men goe on as uncomfortably in it, as he can possibly: therefore he will present them with as many feares, as may be: and because that this is that that nature most abhorreth (for it is the most naturall desire of man to preserve his beeing) I say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nature most abhorreth this; this dissolution and destruction of it selfe, therefore he striveth to affect them with the <hi>feare of death,</hi> especially and above all other. I say, this is Sathans ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he came to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> that he might doe the worke of the Lord, with lesse diligence and comfort, saith <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 5.</note> he, <hi>Wee had feares on every side, horrors within, and terrors without:</hi> It was Sathans devise, that the Apostle might doe the worke of the Lord with lesse strength and comfort, to afflict them with as many feares and horrors as he could. And he hath the same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice still, and still getteth much advantage of men, making men to goe on with lesse comfort in a godly life, adorning their professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of religion lesse, with unchearfull walking, because they have beene <hi>held under the feare of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These are the causes that are from without.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there are some causes from within, from the seruants <note place="margin">The inward causes of the feare of death.</note> of God themselves. And these causes whence <hi>the feare of death ariseth,</hi> are either naturall or sinfull.</p>
                  <p>First, the naturall causes of it are; The apprehens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>on of Death, <note place="margin">1. Naturall.</note> as a thing contrary to nature: and according to the strength of mens apprehension, so is there feare.</p>
                  <p>Now Death in this naturall respect, is fearefull to every man, whether we consider the object, or the subject, the thing or the person in whom it is, we shall find a naturall cause of this, even in the servants of God.</p>
                  <p>First for the object, looke upon Death it selfe, it hath all that in <note place="margin">In respect of the object it selfe: death.</note> it, which makes it a fit object of feare. There bee three things which makes a thing the object of feare, which makes a thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the heart with feare.</p>
                  <p>First, when it is considered as an ill.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when it is considered as an ill, difficult, and hard to be avoided.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when it is considered as an ill to come.</p>
                  <p>For if it be not conceived a thing that is ill, but good; it is not feared, but rather desired.</p>
                  <p>And then againe, if it be but a slight ill, such as hath but a weake strength in it, which a man may easily master, it is not fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but disdained.</p>
                  <p>And then thirdly, if it be an ill that hath strength it, and can hardly be resisted and overcome, if it be present, it is not feared, but grieved for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:14764:39"/>
It must be evill apprehended as future, apprehended as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and apprehended as ill, if it be a thing that is to be feared.</p>
                  <p>Now all these things are in Death, in the apprehension of Gods servants while they live. First, I say, they apprehend it as Ill.</p>
                  <p>Ill is twofold, either that which is contrary to mans will, and <note place="margin">The appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of death as an Ill.</note> so it is called <hi>Malum tristitivum;</hi> or else contrary to mans nature, and so it is <hi>Malum corruptivum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Death is contrary to man in both these senses, both to his nature, and to his will. It is a thing he would not have, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is contrary to his nature: and that is contrary to his nature, that seekes the destruction of nature. Now, when a man appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth Death, as a thing that would destroy nature, that would overthrow, and dissolve, &amp; break in pieces, that goodly Fabrique, (as he conceiveth it) and make that something to become nothing, it is a thing that nature cannot beare, it abhorreth. So the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, as they have nature in them, they have this naturall affection to preserve their beeing: and this in it selfe is not simply sinfull, but so farre as it exceedeth the rule.</p>
                  <p>Therefore you see that because men apprehend Death, as an Ill contrary to nature, they preferre other things that are Ill, in a lesse regard, in a lesse degree before that: A man would rather part with his wealth, then part with his life, as wee see in <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. A man would give God a ransome for his soule if hee could, hee would give all his goods to ransome his life. Hee would rather be poore then not at all: Nay, a man will part with his ease, with his health, rather then with his life: hee will be in paine, rather then he will not bee: <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath, will hee give for his life:</hi> Nay, a man will part with his credit and estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rather then with his life, he will rather be disgraced, then not be: <hi>A living dogge, is better then a dead lyon;</hi> this is the speech <note place="margin">Eccles, 9. 4.</note> of a man naturall: he preferreth a dogge that hath life in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Lyon that is dead; he would rather be a meane living man, then a dead Prince. That is the first thing, men naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Death, as a thing contrary to nature. So it is a naturall Ill.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as man conceiveth Death an Ill contrary to nature, <note place="margin">The appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of death as an ill unavoidable.</note> so he apprehendeth it an Ill not easily overcome. When <hi>Goliah</hi> looked on <hi>David,</hi> on the meannesse of his stature, and the slender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his preparation to fight, he considered him as an enemie, but as a weake one, and therefore in stead of fearing, he disdained him; <hi>Dost thou come to mee as a dogge? I will give thy flesh to the fowles of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth,</hi> hee scorned him: But when the Host of Israel looked on <hi>Goliah,</hi> as a mighty enemie, that they could not easily resist, much lesse overcome; the Text saith, they were full of feare, because of <hi>Goliah:</hi> the strength of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14764:39"/>
adversarie was that that filled them with feare. So when a man lookes upon Death, and seeth it come as a mightie armed man, provided with all weapons of warre, seeth it come in to the most populous Cities (as in the pestilence) and slayeth tenne thousand before it, seeth it come on the most strong and valiant men, and breakes their bones, and destroyeth them; Who can stand before this <hi>Goliah, hee that defieth the Host of God, the host of Israel?</hi> not onely the wicked, but the servants of God are overcome by this enemie: I say, thus nature discourseth, and thus a naturall man apprehendeth Death, and therefore he conceiveth Death to bee a fearfull Ill, because it is a thing that he cannot easily overcome; That is the second.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he conceiveth it as a thing Future, as an Ill to come. <note place="margin">The appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of Death as an ill future.</note> I am yet living and in health, but how soone this health may turne to sicknesse, and this life to Death, I know not; this is that that holdeth downe the spirit <hi>under feare.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>I shall fall one day by the hand of Saul:</hi> one day; so saith a man that liveth now in the multitude of his businesse, in abundance of strength, and abilitie every way, I shall one day fall into the Grave, I shall one day fall into the hands of Death. <hi>Peter</hi> wee know how he affected <hi>Saphira,</hi> with telling her of the death of her husband, and faith he, <hi>the feet of those that carried out thy husband, shall carry thee out;</hi> this affected her with feare so that she fell downe dead upon the apprehension of it.</p>
                  <p>Thus, I say, if we looke upon the object, Death, considered as an Ill, that is, a thing contrary to nature. Death considered againe as a strong and mightie Gyant that none can overcome, but it overcommeth them. And then considered againe as a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon men now in the approach, and wee know not how soone he will graspe a man in his hands, and seaze upon him: this is that, I say, that causeth that naturall feare, that is in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</p>
                  <p>Then againe consider the Subject, the person in whom the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension <note place="margin">In respect of the subject; men.</note> of such an object is, and so likewise we shall see some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in the dispositions of men, or in their state and condition here, that may affect them with a naturall feare of Death.</p>
                  <p>The first is, some men by constitution are more melancholy, and are naturally of a more fearefull temper, indeed distemper. The braine is distempered, the heart is distempered. The braine apprehends things, and lookes upon them through a false glasse, through a deluded fancie, and so makes a false report to the heart, presenteth things more terrible then they are: so sometimes the heart is ill affected, by the misreport that is brought to it by the understanding: sometimes both are distempered, as that humour prevaileth more strongly in the body. So also there are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14764:40"/>
raised up turbulent, and disquieting, and violent passions that make some full of feare, as we see in <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> whose knees did smite together, and all through the apprehension of death, and so <hi>Felix</hi> when he heard of death and judgement to come, hee trembled. Though the feare of these men did not rise from me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, but from inward guilt of conscience, yet the effect sheweth, that when men are affected with the apprehension of Death in the worst sight and apprehension of it, it causeth feare and terrour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it commeth in others, and generally in all from weaknesse of nature, which in some is more then others, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their different constitutions and educations; so the rich many times are more fearefull of Death then the Poore, because they have more to lose, so likewise voluptuous persons, are more fearefull of Death, then those that are more temperate, because by voluptuousnesse they have dis-joynted, and weakned their spirits. So young men many times are more fearefull of Death, then those that are old, as we see in the storie, <hi>Iudg. 8. 20. Iether the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Judg 8. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>sonne of Gideon,</hi> when he should have killed <hi>Zeba,</hi> and <hi>Zalmunna,</hi> the Text saith, <hi>Hee was afraid because hee was a young man,</hi> but <hi>Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> that was elder did it willingly, as a man better accustomed, and experienced with observations of changes, and varieties of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents amongst men.</p>
                  <p>We shall see the servants of God themselves have discovered this weaknesse of spirit, specially upon sudden apprehensions of things. <hi>Abraham</hi> upon the sudden and violent apprehension of Death, was put to asinfull shift: <hi>I thought</hi> (faith he) <hi>the feare of God</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 20:</note> 
                     <hi>is not in this place, and they will slay me for my wives sake, therefore I said, this is my sister.</hi> So <hi>Samuel,</hi> when God sent him to anoint <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> he discovered this weaknesse, <hi>If Saul should know what I am a doing, he will slay me;</hi> therefore hee desired to have some other <note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.</note> message, under the colour whereof he might put <hi>Saul</hi> off. So <hi>Peter</hi> out of a sudden apprehension of death, and feare of it, he denyed his Master: This weaknesse of spirit is in man naturally.</p>
                  <p>Further, there is another thing that causeth this naturall feare, and that is, the unacquaintednesse men have with Death, there is somewhat in this matter, that is strange to men; notwithstanding they heare, and see many die before them daily, they heare things spoken of by the Minister, and they reade the Scripture, and many excellent comforts, but who hath seene these? what becommeth of these men? they see Death the strict Porter of the world, let men out of the earth, but he locks the dore of the Grave upon them, and none commeth backe againe to tell what is done <hi>in that place of silence,</hi> to tell what is become of men, when they are in the Grave, how they speed in that world of soules; there is no
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14764:40"/>
man returneth from the dead to report these things to them. Now this affecteth the naturall man, nay all men naturally are affected with the fearefull apprehension of death, because they <hi>know not what will come after,</hi> as the naturall man speakes in Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astes. When <hi>Ioram</hi> set out a watch-man to see what was abroad, and spied an Armie comming, he sent a servant, but <hi>Iehu</hi> biddeth <hi>him goe behind him,</hi> he sendeth another, and <hi>hee goeth behind him</hi> still: saith he, <hi>I see the men goe; but they come not backe:</hi> the Text saith, <hi>hee was afraid. Make ready the Chariot,</hi> saith <hi>Ioram;</hi> If this be the issue that men goe, but never come backe againe, it is high time to looke about us. Certainly (beloved) such are the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of death: Wee see men (saith the naturall man) goe downe to the Grave, and not come backe againe, wee see that a man ceaseth to bee, and to doe those actions that we doe, when we are upon the earth, therefore let us consider the matter more seriously. When the <hi>Captaine of the fifty,</hi> that came to the <hi>Mount</hi> to <hi>Elijah,</hi> saw the two former <hi>Captaines,</hi> and their <hi>companies</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, saw that they were all dead, that they ceased to bee, but he saw not what became of them afterward, therefore he commeth with feare to the Prophet, and intreateth him that <hi>his life might be precious in his sight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All strange things we know affect men, and every thing, as it is more strange; so it more affecteth man naturally: Let there but come a beast out of the Wildernesse, assoone as ever he commeth unto a man and seeth him, he flieth from him, because he is not used to the sight of man, it is strange to him; but now take a beast that is brought up in the pasture, in the field, he will come to a man without feare, because he is used to the sight of him. So it is here, Death is apprehended as a strange thing, as a thing that a man never knew by experience; Men have seene thus much, that people have died, but they never heard of any that came backe againe to tell them how it fared with them after death. This (I say) that men should goe to the <hi>place of silence,</hi> and have all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hushed, all things kept secret downe there, there commeth no report thence, this affecteth men with feare.</p>
                  <p>These are the naturall causes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there are other causes within, that affect men with <note place="margin">2. Inward causes sinfull.</note> the feare of death, and those are sinfull causes.</p>
                  <p>First, the want of the feare of God; and as this is lesse, so the <hi>feare</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. The want of the feare of God.</note> 
                     <hi>of Death</hi> is more: therefore we shall find that wicked men that cast off the feare of God in their lives, they are slavishly <hi>held under the feare of death,</hi> this you shall see in those examples of <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> a man that set himselfe with a high hand against God, went on in a contemptuous course against God, and prophaned the <hi>holy vessels,</hi> when there was <hi>a hand writing upon the wall,</hi> some terrible thing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14764:41"/>
presented to him, his <hi>knees smote together,</hi> hee could not hold his joynts still: And so <hi>Felix,</hi> a man that lived without the feare of God, when he <hi>heard of judgement,</hi> and other things; the text saith <hi>he trembled;</hi> and so likewise <hi>Cain,</hi> and divers others, I need not stand on it.</p>
                  <p>It was one of the Judgements threatned in part, 28. <hi>Deut. Because</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 28. 65. 66. &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>thou dost not feare the Lord thy God, therefore wheresoever thou goest, thou shalt find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have any rest, but the Lord shall give thee a trembling heart, and thy life shall hang in doubt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee</hi> (that is, thou shalt be in continuall feare of death) <hi>and thou shalt feare day and night, and shall have none assurance of thy life; in the Morning thou shalt say, would God it were Even, and at even thou shalt say, would God it were morning, because of the feare of thine heart where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou shalt feare; and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.</hi> This is this is the first thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another thing is this, when mens hearts are too much <note place="margin">2. Inordinate love of the world.</note> glued to the world, and marke it, according as there is worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and worldly-mindednesse in the hearts of Gods servants, so the feare of Death is more in them: according to the strength of the one, is the feare of the other. What is it that disquieteth men ordinarily, and makes them that they cannot think of Death with comfort, but this? now they must lose their company, part with all their friends when they die once. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> complained of that, <hi>I shall see man no more</hi> (saith he) <hi>with the Inhabitants of the world.</hi> This <note place="margin">Isa. 38. 11.</note> I say, is that that affecteth the heart exceedingly, that they must lose all their friends, specially when husband and wife must part, parents and children must part, and familiar and deare acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance must part, this causeth the <hi>feare of death,</hi> because the heart is too much set upon the creature. So likewise worldly businesse, when a man loveth much employment, much businesse, he cannot abide to thinke of death, Why so? because <hi>all worke, all enterprises cease in the grave</hi> (as <hi>Iob</hi> saith) A man hath neither the workes of his hands, nor the enterprises of his head in the grave, all actions cease, both of the mind and bodie there. So when a mans heart is set upon pleasures below, <hi>there is neither love nor hatred in the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>grave</hi> (saith <hi>Solomou.)</hi> That is, those things that affected the heart, that men love, they cease there, all his pleasures and comforts are gone. So if a man love honour, and applause amongst men, it ceaseth in the grave, all honour there is laid in the dust, <hi>contempt is cast upon Princes:</hi> this is that that affecteth men exceedingly, that they shall lose their honours and pleasures, and acquaintance, and businesse, and all when they come to the grave, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause mens hearts are set too much upon these things. That is the second reason. <note place="margin">3. Want of the assurance of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a third thing, which is a sinfull cause of this feare of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14764:41"/>
Death, and that is the want of Assurance. There be two things that a man not being assured of, makes him feare Death, and these may be in the children of God, and as they are more in any one, so the <hi>feare of death</hi> is more in them.</p>
                  <p>The first is, when they are not assured of reconciliation with God, that God is at peace with them, pleased with them in Christ. The want of this assurance makes death fearefull, for now they looke upon Death, as a Sergeant, as a Jaylour, either it is a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant to take them off their present comforts, or as a Jaylour to hold them under those bonds and fetters, that they would faine escape: Now when a man looks upon Death either way, it is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible. As a Sergeant; so the rich man in the Gospell, <hi>This night</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>they shall fetch thy soule from thee:</hi> they shall come to thee as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant to a Debtour, to require a debt; they shall require thy soule of thee; Now, we all know, that a man that is in debt, and either hath it not to pay, or is unwilling to part with that he hath, such a man cannot indure the sight of a Sergeant above all men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he commeth to fetch that from him, that he would not part with. Or if he looke upon Death as a Jaylour, so Christ saith; <hi>Agree with thy adversarie quickly, lest hee deliver thee to the Iudge, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mar. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>hee give thee to the Iaylour,</hi> and then he holdeth thee <hi>in prison, from whence thou shalt not goe out, till thou have paid the uttermost farthing.</hi> Now when a man looks on Death as a Jaylour, that holdeth all in the grave, till the great Judge of heaven and earth calleth for them, at the generall day of Assizes, that great day of appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when all the world shall be gathered together, and every prison shall giue up their prisoners, <hi>The sea and the grave shall give up their dead.</hi> I say, when a man standeth thus as unreconciled to God, or at least, as one that doth not apprehend this reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is not perswaded of this, that God is reconciled to him, it is no marvell if Death be terrible to him. Therefore in the sixth of the Revelation; <hi>The Kings and Captaines, and the great and mighty men,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>they cryed to the mountaines to fall upon them, and to hide them, from the presence of the Lambe, because the great day of wrath was come, and who could stand.</hi> So we see in 33. <hi>Isa.</hi> 14. there is crying out concerning the comming of God, <hi>the sinners in Sion, the hypocrites are afraid,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 33. 14.</note> what is their feare? <hi>who shall dwell with everlasting burnings? and who shall remaine with consuming fire?</hi> when they shall see nothing but terrourand wrath in God, fire and consumption, when they see nothing but such terrible things, then feare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth upon them. Now marke, hypocrites stand altogether unreconciled, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no marvell if they be afraid: and the Saints of God, so farre as they are defective in the assurance of Gods love, so farre they conceive themselves in the state of Hypocrites, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are so full of feares.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:14764:42"/>
Againe, a second thing that they stand unresolved of, is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the future estates of their soules and bodies after death, they are not sure of this, that there is a better condition afterwards: this is that great question, <hi>Whether goe wee?</hi> I goe now out of the bodie, and whither then? I goe out of the world, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then? I am going out of the company of men, and whither then? shall I goe to Angels and Saints, or to divels? shall I goe to Heaven or to Hell? shall I have a beeing or not, in miserie or in happinesse? They know not what shall become of them, they are unresolved of this point, of their owne state to come, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they shall be in happinesse or horrour after death, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Death is terrible, You have the point opened. I will answer an objection or two, and then come to the use.</p>
                  <p>It may be objected: It seemeth the servants of God are not <note place="margin">Obiect. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>kept under the feare of death:</hi> all those that are in the state of grace, have faith; faith, that spendeth these feares, and therefore since they are in the state of beleevers, how can they be <hi>held under the feare of death?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I answer briefly; there is faith in all the children of <note place="margin">Answ.</note> God that are effectually called, but wee must know that Faith is considerable two wayes, first as it is in conflict, and secondly as it is out of conflict. Now the Faith of Gods servants in conflict, so sometime it is in conflict with feare, and sadnesse of spirit, <hi>Why</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 42.</note> 
                     <hi>art thou cast downe, oh my soule? why art thou disquieted within me?</hi> &amp;c. Sometime it is in conflict with reason and sense; thus the people of Israel, when they came into the Wildernesse, they looked for <note place="margin">Exod. 14. 11.</note> nothing but dying, and destruction of nature (for sense presented it to them,) therefore saith <hi>Moses</hi> (which is the voyce of Faith) <hi>Stand still, and see the salvation of God,</hi> &amp;c. Now in this conflict the successe is doubtfull, sometime (as it was betweene <hi>Amalek</hi> and Israel fighting together) <hi>Amalek</hi> prevailed, &amp; Israel had the worst: sometime Israel preuailed, and <hi>Amalek</hi> had the worst, so sometime Faith prevaileth against sense, and those fears that arise from sense, and somtime again carnal fears, and Sense prevaileth against Faith, now accordingly are those effects in the hearts of Gods children.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, sometime Faith is out of conflict, it now trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheth in assurance, it is come now to full assurance of Faith, as it is called in the Scripture, and then there is nothing so comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and desirable as death it selfe to the servants of God. So wee see <hi>David</hi> in the 23. Psal. <hi>Though I walke through the valley of the shadow of death, I will feare none ill, for thou Lord art with mee:</hi> And <note place="margin">Psal. 23.</note> so the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> triumpheth over all things, <hi>Nothing shall separate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> from the love of God in Christ, neither principalities nor powers, nor life, nor death, nor things to come,</hi> nothing shall doe it, the Apostles faith now was out of conflict, it had got the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14764:42"/>
field, the day of Sense, and now he lookes on Death with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. So that I say in that measure that Faith workes in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, <hi>feare of death</hi> ceaseth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it may be objected. But we see the servants of God <note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> are said <hi>to love the appearance of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Paul</hi> is said <hi>to desire to bee dissolved, and to bee with Christ,</hi> How can these stand with the <hi>feare of death,</hi> under which Gods servants <hi>are held.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I answer briefly. Gods servants must be considered in <note place="margin">Answ.</note> their desires two wayes. First, in their generall desires; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in a particular state wherein they are. In their generall course, their desire is most for the <hi>appearing of Christ,</hi> they most desire to be with him as <hi>best for them:</hi> but take them in some particular state wherein they are lesse provided, and lesse fitted and prepared, then, they may be at a stand in their desires, they may have the feare of death in them. As a wife, her generall desire is for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much as for the presence of her husband, yet she may be under some particular unfitnesse, there may be something or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the way, that she would not have him come in at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, though her desire be for nothing so much as for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. So it may be the case of the servants of God, they may say sometimes, <hi>Lord spare mee a little before I goe hence</hi> to strengthen my faith, to perfect my repentance and holinesse, to doe some particular worke, and the like. <hi>David</hi> considered this, that there was something that he might doe that he had not done, and that he would faine doe before he went: and so <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and the rest of the servants of God. The point is cleare. I come to the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> For exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It shall be a word of exhortation (to cut of otheruses) and that is this.</p>
                  <p>To stirre up the servants of God, that if they be disposed to distempers <hi>under which they are held,</hi> that they are afraid to die, that therefore they labour by all good meanes, to shake off <hi>the feare of death.</hi> Why? Consider and note well those two things that are in the Text.</p>
                  <p>The first is this, that it is an uncomfortable state to be <hi>held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">To be under the feare of death an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable estate.</note> 
                     <hi>the feare of Death,</hi> you see it is called <hi>a Bondage</hi> here, and that is enough to show the uncomfortablenesse of it, he saith, by the <hi>feare of death, they were held in Bondage all their life long.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the feare of Death is a bondage principally in these two <note place="margin">The feare of death a bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage in two respects.</note> respects, first, because it is with them, as it is with a Bond-slave. A Bond-slave is afraid to looke on him that hath the command of him, he apprehendeth him as no friend, therfore he doth not love to looke on him: so it is in this case, when a man lookes upon Death as a thing that is no friend to him, he cannot abide to looke
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14764:43"/>
on him, every thought of Death, is a presenting of death to him, and it is a miserable bondage, when a man cannot present Death to himselfe without feare.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is this in it that makes it a bondage, it holdeth <note place="margin">2.</note> downe the spirit of a man. A bond-slave (you know) is bound with fetters and chaines in his captivitie, so that he hath neither freedome of spirit, nor freedome of action: So it is with a man that is <hi>held under the feare of Death,</hi> he cannot doe what he would, he cannot rejoyce in God; he cannot delight in the apprehension of glory to come; he cannot entertaine a thought of parting with things present, with that securitie, and comfort of heart, that he should doe, and all because this feare, (as the fetters) bindeth his hands and his feet, and keepeth him in bondage. This is the first thing, the feare of death, to be held under it, it is an uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble state.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as it is uncomfortable, so it is possible that the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <note place="margin">It is possible to be freed from the feare of death.</note> of God, may be free from these feares under which they are held. We see the text sheweth it, <hi>Christ came for this end, that having destroyed him that hath the power of death, that is the divell, hee might deliver those, that for feare of death were held under bondage.</hi> Did Christ come for this end? then it is possible to bee had, for certainly Christ would not lose his end he came for: this was his end, not onely to deliver them from eternall death, but also from the feare of temporall death; It is possible therefore; The ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God have found it, and therefore you shall see them brought in insulting, and triumphing, and glorying over Death; <hi>Oh death, where is thy sting? oh Grave, where is thy victory? thankes be to God that hath given us victory, through Christ our Lord:</hi> When they looked upon Death through Christ, they looked on it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this feare, the sting and power is tooke out, the very nature of it is changed, and it is made now every way beneficiall. I say it is possible, for we are regenerate, and begotten againe to a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope, to an inheritance immortall and undefiled, and in what measure the hope of heaven is in the heart of man, in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the <hi>feare of death</hi> falleth in that heart, now it is possible that we may attaine this fulnesse of hope, and therefore it is possible that we may be freed quite from the feare of Death.</p>
                  <p>This may suffice by way of motive. A word or two by way of direction. If this be possible to be had, how shall the servants of God get it? you see some of Gods servants <hi>are held under the feare of death, and that all their life long,</hi> how shall we be freed from this feare? <note place="margin">Meanes to be freed from the feare of death.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I should now orderly take up the particulars laid downe as causes, and shew that by these it is cured: as for instance. Doth God doe this for this end, that he may humble a man? then the <note place="margin">1. Humilitie.</note>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:14764:43"/>
more humble thou art, the lesse thou shalt be in the feare of Death, for God layeth these feares upon men to humble them, therefore labour for perfect humiliation, and thou shalt perfectly ridde these feares out of thy heart: as we see plainly, the servants of God, the more humble they have growne, the lesse carefull they have beene of life, and the lesse fearefull of Death: And so those servants of God that have beene brought to deny themselves, and to renounce all their worldly expectation and advancements, they have alwayes beene ready to die. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> was growne humble, and the Lord had prevailed upon him, kept downe his spirit from <hi>being exalted above measure,</hi> and now (saith he) <hi>my life is not deare to mee,</hi> he was content to lay downe his life and all when he was humbled. Beloved, pride in some outward excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies or other, setteth a man above his place, therefore when a man is tooke off from all that puffes up the spirit of a man, he will be content, to lay downe any of those things, even life it selfe if need be.</p>
                  <p>Againe secondly; Doth God doe it to strengthen faith in a <note place="margin">2. Faith.</note> man? then the more thou strengthenest faith, the more thou shalt be freed from these feares; you know faith lookes upon Christ as the proper obiect of it, and the more a man interesteth himselfe in Christ, the more by Christ, hee is freed from the feare of Death. Christ hath redeemed us from the Grave and from Death, and therefore when by faith hee lookes upon Christ, and through him upon Death; hee lookes upon that, as a thing made, instead of poison a medicine; in stead of a destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a Saviour and deliverer, as a meanes to free him from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of sinne and miserie and afflictions, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly; Doth God doe this, that he may make men more holy <note place="margin">3. Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> and watchfull in their course? then certainly the more thou canst purge out thy sinne in the course of thy life, the lesse thou shalt feare death. <hi>The sting of Death is sinne,</hi> then if thou wilt have Death comfortable, let thy life be conformable to Gods rule and word, or else every sinne will present it selfe in death before thee, specially those sinnes, thou allowest thy selfe in, will make Death as bitter as Hell.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly; Doth God doe it for this end, that he may make thee <note place="margin">4. Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> better prepared for death? Then the more thou art prepared for Death before hand, the lesse thou shalt feare it, when it commeth upon thee, it will not come as a stranger, but thou wilt be ready to receive it, as one with whom thou art acquainted already.</p>
                  <p>It is a great matter if men could learne this wisedome <hi>to die dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> that is, be every day imployed, as dying daily: I meane for the manner of your carriage, not for the matter, for the substance of the dutie. If a man were sure to die this day, he would lay aside
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14764:44"/>
all businesse, and set himselfe to be prepared for judgement, and would lay aside the use of any other comforts and delights. But that is not the meaning, but this, that we carry our selves in busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse every day, as if Death should seize upon us in that businesse, that we <hi>might be found well-doing;</hi> that is, when a man followeth his earthly businesse with a heavenly mind, when he keepeth to the rule of righteousnesse, and truth in his ordinary calling, when he is doing, or receiving good in his company, when he useth his pleasures and recreations, as the whet-stone to the Sithe, to make him fitter for God; I say, when thus we doe things to a right end, and in a right maner; if Death now should seize upon us in such an action, it should find us well-doing: And this is that we perswade you to, if you would have death comfortable, and not terrible, be so imployed, as that your actions may be good, both for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and forme, that you are now about, because Death may strike you in such an action. But I cannot stand on these particulars.</p>
                  <p>Againe, for the causes in our selves; If you would be freed <note place="margin">5. Right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of Death.</note> from the terrours of Death, then rectifie your apprehensions and opinions of Death, thinke of it as it is, as it is I say to beleevers, to those that are in Christ.</p>
                  <p>It is not the destruction of nature, and so a naturall Ill, as you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it; It is rather a cure of nature, for assoone as ever we live, we are dying, and all our life, it is but a living death, a continuall decaying and dying. Now when death commeth, it putteth an end to all the decayes of nature, and setteth all right againe. It is but asleepe, and sleepe it is not a destruction, but a helpe of the bodie, and that which inableth to vigour and strength, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to action,</p>
                  <p>Againe, it is not the destruction of any part of a man, the body it selfe is not destroyed: indeed it is in the Grave, but it is in the grave, as in a bed of peace, <hi>They shall come and rest in their beddes</hi> (saith the Prophet;) The grave is but as a bed wherein the body lies asleepe, and no man (you know) is troubled with feare that hee goeth to bed. The grave is but as Gods chest to keepe in all his Treasure, whereof the bodies of his servants are apart, precious to him, even in the grave, in death, <hi>Precious in the sight of the Lord, is the death of his Saints;</hi> and God will open this Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, and the Chest of the Grave, in the great day of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and bring the body out againe, and then it shall be as good as ever it was, nay, I say not onely as good, but much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too, for our <hi>vile bodies shall bee made like the glorious bodie of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ. Phil.</hi> 3. No man when he goeth to bed, thinkes much to have his old cloathes taken off, that they may be mended, and made better against morning. When we sleepe in the Grave, it is no more but this, the garment of the soule, the body, the old ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14764:44"/>
that is taken off, that it may be made better, and a more glorious body, this is all, we lose nothing by it, but our estates, even our bodily estate is bettered by it.</p>
                  <p>And for the Soule, Death doth not destroy that neither, for know this, the soule liveth for ever, the <hi>bodie</hi> indeed <hi>returneth to the Earth as it was,</hi> but <hi>the soule returneth to God that gave it;</hi> The soule I say liveth, that is the thing that Christ himselfe proveth in 22. <hi>Mat. Abraham</hi> is alive, why so? <hi>For God is not the God of the dead, but of the living;</hi> for God said, <hi>I am the God of Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. How can this be, that God is the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet he is dead? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he is dead, if wee looke to the separation of the soule and body, in the cessation of bodily actions; but if we looke to the better part of <hi>Abraham,</hi> his soule, that continueth, the ever-living God hath made an everlasting Covenant with him, and therefore he dieth not.</p>
                  <p>Againe it is not onely, not the destruction of nature, but not of your actions neither, Death doth not destroy them neither; Indeed there is a cessation of bodily actions, but it is, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may have better strength, and be the fitter instrument of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse after: But for those actions of the soule, that depend not upon the body, they are as perfectly done, when we are dead, as when we are alive, and better too. When a man liveth upon the earth (you see,) his soule is much hindered by the body; A dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered sicke crazie body, or a full well-fed body, is a hindrance to the soule, because of that tie that is betweene the body, and the soule, and the spirit: so there is a simpathy, the soule is affected some what in this sense. But it is not so then, the soule shall bee loosed from the body, and so freer for spirituall actions then now it is. <hi>The soules under the Altar,</hi> they crie, <hi>How long Lord, holy and just, wilt thou not revenge our bloud upon them that are upon the earth?</hi> The soules of Gods servants you see then are glorified, when they are out of the body, and therefore shall glorifie God more perfectly, and enjoy God more freely and fully, then now while their soules are in these mortall bodies. And at that very instant, when the soule of Gods servant is carried out of the body to heaven, it more perfectly injoyeth Christ, and is more sensible, and more fit to answer the love of Christ to him, then ever when it was in the body. So then here is a cessation of baser actions and imployments, to give place to more noble, and heavenly, and excellent actions, wherein the soule shall bee employed in heaven. There is then no losse of actions neither.</p>
                  <p>Againe, there is no losse of company. This is a thing that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth men, husband and wife to part, friends to part. But we lose no company by death, howsoever we lose the company of men, that we cannot assure our selves are friends indeed: for of all the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14764:45"/>
friends we speake of in the maine point, when they come to be tryed, there are few to be found to be friends: But then, we goe to them whose love is perfect, that you may be sure of, and have the truth of their love. Againe, how little comfort, nay how little have you company with those friends you desire? Is not much part of our life spent without any fight of our friends? is not halfe of it spent in sleep in the night? and the other halfe in businesse and pleasure? Alas! how little time have we to enjoy our friends we rest on? But then, we shall perfectly enjoy them, when there shall be no need of sleepe, when there shall be perfection of love, and freedome from distraction and imployment, when the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God shall fully, and freely, and sweetly, and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enjoy one the other. <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and the meanest of the Saints, shall meet in the expression of love, in such a perfection as we cannot speake of. And this is certaine, you shall goe to many. <hi>Who can tell the dust of Iacob?</hi> Now you have some one, or two, or three, or a few men or women that you account friends, and dote much upon, but then you shall have ennume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable company, a world of friends of men and women, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, they cannot be numbred, they are as the starres of heaven for number. I say there is no losse of company by this meanes.</p>
                  <p>Againe, you shall lose no pleasures by death, it may be you shall lose some few sensuall bruitish pleasures, a few mixed, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt pleasures, pleasures that have the mixture of sorrow and feare in them, that imbitters them to the soule of a man, but it shall not be so then: you shall be freed from imperfect pleasures, and have perfect ones at Gods right hand for evermore, pure pleasures.</p>
                  <p>Againe, you lose no necessary convenience neither, the rich man loseth no riches by death; he loseth his money, doth he lose his riches therefore? No; The Angels are rich, but they have no money; the Saints are rich, they want nothing, but they have no money. It may be thou losest a child, thou shalt find a Father; it may be thou losest a weake friend, that loveth not long, or it may be not so truly as thou thinkest he doth; and thou findest friends that are many and perfect, and pure in their love, that love with a perfect heart; And what then are all those losses, when you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that which shall make the soule happy for ever?</p>
                  <p>Thus I say you should rectifie your opinions concerning Death, looke upon it aright, have true apprehensions of it.</p>
                  <p>Get an intrest in Christ, and looke on death through him, get faith, and then all these things that I haue spoken shall be your <note place="margin">Assurance of Gods favour.</note> advantage, so the Apostle concludeth, <hi>Christ is to us in life and in death advantage;</hi> If we live he is gaine to us in life, and if we die, he is advantage to us in death. And death is reckoned amongst
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14764:45"/>
the speciall favours and priviledges Christ hath given to his Church; <hi>All are yours,</hi> what all? <hi>life and death, things present, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>things to come; all are yours, and you are Christs, and Christ is Gods.</hi> So we see that Death is amongst the priviledges that Christ hath given his Church, therefore rectifie your opinions concerning Death, make good that I spake before, and you shall find this good that I now speake.</p>
                  <p>And for the last, the unacquaintance with Death: let not that trouble you, none come from the dead to tell you what is done there, but looke on the servants of God before, and when they die, and you shall find enough how they apprehended Death, when they have looked on it in the glasse of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>Looke upon them before death, <hi>Iacob</hi> being to close up his dayes with blessing of his children; <hi>Lord</hi> (saith hee) <hi>I have wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for thy salvation.</hi> Hee looked upon Death through Christ, the Saviour of the world, that he should bee saved by him: and though it be true that there is a further meaning for the Tribes in those words of <hi>Iacob,</hi> yet this was proper to <hi>Iacob</hi> himselfe, hee looked upon Death now approching, as that that he was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from, and set into that freedome purchased by Christ. So old <hi>Simeon, Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy word, for mine eyes have seene thy salvation; Iacob</hi> accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it his salvation, old <hi>Simeon,</hi> a departure from a worse place to a better, from worse company and comforts to a better; A change for the better still, and a departing in peace.</p>
                  <p>Againe secondly, looke on the servants of God in death, see what they have said too: <hi>Iosiah,</hi> a man that was upright in heart, he <hi>went to the grave in peace,</hi> he was <hi>gathered to his fathers in peace, that he should not see the evill that should come upon his people:</hi> here is all: it was but a peaceable taking of him away from a more troubelous condition if he had lived longer. Beloved, he died in warre, yet it is said he was <hi>gathered in peace;</hi> he had inward peace with God, though he failed in that particular action. And the Apostle in the 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 4. This is our desire that wee may bee clothed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>not that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortalitie may bee swallowed up of life.</hi> A strange speech, he counteth death life to him, he counteth the death of this life, to be the death of morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, by laying <hi>aside this earthly tabernacle</hi> (as he saith in the first verse) <hi>mortalitie is swallowed up of life:</hi> And therefore you give wrong names to things, for while you live, you die, because your life it is a dying condition, and while you die, you live, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause then the cessation of life it is as the river <hi>Iordan</hi> to the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> no more but a passage to <hi>Canaan,</hi> not a floud to drowne them, so it is with the servants of God, death is but a passage to heaven, it is not destructive to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:14764:46"/>
So that if men did but rectifie their opinions of Death (as I told you before) when their hearts are right set, when they are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and not lifted up with worldly things, when their faith is strengthned, and setled in them, when they are made watchfull in a holy course, looking for Death, when they are established with the assurance of Gods favour, then I say they may find that all these naturall feares of death were upon mistake, they did not rightly apprehend the thing. Other things I should have added, but I am loth to hold you too long.</p>
                  <p>A word for the occasion; and so I will conclude; The depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our Sister here was the occasion, as of this meeting here, so of this Text in particular. Shee gave good evidence to those that knew her more inwardly, that she was in Christ, that she was <hi>delivered not onely from eternall death, but from feare of temporall death too.</hi> It pleased God to exercise her a great while under the <hi>feare of death,</hi> the apprehension of it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> of some terrour to her, but neverthelesse when God called her to it indeed, then the <hi>feare of Death</hi> was hid from her, and Christ then applied the fruit of his death, in <hi>freeing</hi> her from those feares. Shee was not freed from them out of a Stoycall Appethy, or want of naturall affection and passion, but out of a spirituall and faithfull application of Christ to herselfe upon good grounds. Shee looked upon God as her Father, and much delighted to expresse her apprehension of him under that notion, and shee very often manifested her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in that interest she had in God, as his child: no marvell then if the <hi>feare of death</hi> were taken away: we see here in the text, that <hi>they are children that are delivered from the feare of death.</hi> When we are in the state of Gods children by adoption and grace, then there is rather a desire, then a feare of death: It is but as our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>white Horse,</hi> so it is called in the Revelation. A child at schoole, when he seeth one riding post through the streets, as if he would runne over him, or tread upon him, he cryeth out: But if he sees that it is his fathers man sent to bring him from schoole to his Fathers house, all his feare is past, and he laugheth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth. So when we are the sonnes and daughters of God by adoption, we apprehend Death as our Fathers pale Horse, sent by him to bring us, from a place of prison on earth, home to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house, a place of libertie in heaven; So it was with her.</p>
                  <p>She looked upon Christ as her Husband, and though she left a husband upon earth, yet (it was her owne expression) <hi>shee was to goe to her Husband in heaven, which was farre better for her.</hi> And therefore (I say) having these apprehensions of God as her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that she was adopted to the state of a child by grace, and looking upon Christ as her husband, no marvell shee was freed from the feare of Death. And that these were upon good grounds,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14764:46"/>
those that knew her course best, knew that she expressed it by her abundant care to please God, by her desire to serve God, by her endevour to mortifie and subdue ill in her selfe, by her growth in grace in her latter times, these good evidences did shew that it was not a rash and groundlesse perswasion, but a true and reall appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of God and Christ that freed her from this <hi>Feare of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beloved, many times the life of Gods servants is uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to them, because (for some of those reasons I have spoken of before) they are afraid of Death, and they apprehend it not with comfort, and this they doe, because they see not the interest they have in better comforts then Death can take from them; I have the rather therefore spoke this of her, that you may take notice of it, and apply it to your selves.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude, make this use of all, to grow more humble, and watchfull, and holy, to strengthen faith more, and by dying daily to prepare more for Death: For faith is the rectified appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of things: Death it is not so fearefull as you thinke it is, you lose not so much as you thinke you lose. Nay againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this trouble, and this feare dishonoureth God, therefore when God calleth us to Death, he hideth these feares from us, as he did from this servant of Christ at this time before us, though she were fearfull before, yet she was exceeding comfortable all the time, when the apprehension of Death approched upon her. So it shall be with thee, if thou bee carefull to use the meanss to prepare for Death: mind thou the dutie that God enjoyneth thee in thy life, and leave the event and issue to him; either hee will glorifie himselfe by thy feares, or else he will glorifie himselfe by delivering thee from thy feares.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Patience</hi> (in a word) <hi>it is a grace or fruit of Gods spirit, whereby the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Definition of Patience.</note> 
                     <hi>heart of a beleever willingly submitteth it selfe to the will of God in all afflictions, and changes in this life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I say, <hi>it is a worke or fruit of Gods spirit.</hi> In respect of this worke, the efficient is called, <hi>The God of Patience.</hi> And <hi>long suffering</hi> (which <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 5. Gal. 5. 22.</note> is the same with <hi>Patience)</hi> is made a <hi>fruit of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 22.</p>
                  <p>The subject of this, is <hi>the Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The act of this <hi>Patience,</hi> is <hi>to submit a mans selfe willingly to God in afflictions:</hi> I say <hi>willingly,</hi> for there is a submission which is by force; when God subjects a man to himselfe, not by a graci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> and sweet inclining of the will, but by a powerfull subduing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the person.</p>
                  <p>Now, when I say there is such a <hi>willing submission to God in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;</hi> the meaning is thus; That there may be in a beleever, in a child of God, a <hi>Velietie,</hi> an inclination of the will, a naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be freed from Afflictions, yet neverthelesse there is in him that willingnesse that is here the <hi>Patience</hi> of a Christian. There may be a willingnesse, and an unwillingnesse in one and the same person arising from divers principles. In every renewed soule, there is a principle of nature, and a principle of grace (I speake not now of corrupt nature, but of pure nature, for we may so speake.) There is a desire that ariseth from nature, and that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the conservation of a mans beeing, and to the conservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a man in all the comforts, and contentments of his beeing: This is, and may be in a child of God. But then it is overswayed by grace, which makes a man now resigne up this will of his to Gods hand, to be content (against his owne naturall desires,) to bee disposed of according to Gods will. This wee may see in our Lord and Saviour: <hi>Father</hi> (saith he) <hi>if it be possible, let this cup</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>passe from mee.</hi> Here is a desire to keepe, not onely in his naturall beeing, but to keepe in the comfort of nature and life: And this is lawfull and a good desire; for these affections, are the workes of God upon the soule of man. The will of man moveth naturally by these affections, these desires they are the fruits of nature, and so the workes of God in nature, and therefore not simply to be blamed. But now that which keepeth them within compasse, is an over-ruling worke of grace, whereby the creature is made to acknowledge his distance from the Creatour, and that subjection he oweth to God, as the soveraigne Lord of nature, and of all creatures. And in this sense our Saviour Christ doth check his naturall desires; <hi>If it be possible let this cup passe from me, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14764:49"/>
not as I will, but as thou wilt,</hi> saith he. So here is a worke of grace, ordering and over-ruling nature, that it might not exceed that proportion of the creature, and those desires that should be in nature.</p>
                  <p>So then you see what kind of willingnesse we meane, such a kind of willingnesse, as in the issue and close resteth in Gods will.</p>
                  <p>The object of this <hi>Patience,</hi> is <hi>Afflictions, and the changes of this life.</hi> Affliction is properly any thing that is grievous to a mans sense, any thing that crosseth a mans will. There are some things that indeed are Afflictions, but not to this or that person, because heis not sensible of them, or because he is not carried with any desires against them: But when a man is crost in his will, that is an affliction to him; but specially when this is set on him with a change, when God brings, as <hi>Iob</hi> speakes, <hi>changes upon him,</hi> when a man is in another turning and course of life, this is an affliction indeed. A man that hath tasted the sweetnesse of prosperitie, now to be left in affliction, this was <hi>Iobs</hi> case, and this is specially the object of <hi>Patience. You have heard of the patience of Iob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how did <hi>Iobs patience</hi> appeare in the Afflictions, in the changes of his life? That notwithstanding he had felt the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a prosperous estate, and the comfort of friends, yea, and the comfort of Gods favour shining upon his heart, and many other particular mercies, yet when God turned his hand, and tooke away the comforts of his life, the comfort and societie of his friends, the comfortable expressions of his owne love to his soule, and threatned the taking away even of life it selfe; <hi>Iob</hi> could now in this case resolve to rest in the determination, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and will of God. Here is <hi>Patience</hi> now.</p>
                  <p>Thus briefly you have heard what the duty is, to which the Apostle exhorteth; It is <hi>patience,</hi> that is, <hi>a willing resigning of our selves to Gods appointment in the changes of our life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now that is not enough, the Apostle contents not himselfe <note place="margin">What it is to let patience have her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect worke. Rom. 15. 13.</note> to say, <hi>Have Patience,</hi> but, <hi>let Patience have her perfect worke;</hi> Hee would have them grow in <hi>Patience,</hi> to grow from one degree to another, to <hi>abound</hi> in <hi>Patience</hi> (as the Apostle speakes of <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Ioy</hi> in the 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.) that they might not onely have <hi>patience,</hi> but have it brought to <hi>perfection,</hi> which in the 1. <hi>Coll.</hi> 11. is called <hi>all long suffering,</hi> that there might not be the least defect, that they <note place="margin">Collos. 1. 11.</note> might have a measure of <hi>patience</hi> proportionable to the measure of Tryals: that look as God increased the measure of their tryals upon them, so they might have <hi>patience</hi> to answer those tryals, somewhat to support the heart, when the greatest weight should be laid upon the soule to presse it downe: so the word <hi>Hipomene,</hi> that is translated <hi>patience</hi> signifieth, to beare up a man, to support him under a burthen, that he be not prest downe by it. So hee
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14764:50"/>
would have them have such a measure of <hi>patience,</hi> as might beare up the soule in the greatest pressures, that though they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, they might not be broken in their afflictions. Thus you have the duty opened; <hi>Let Patience have her perfect worke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reason is, <hi>that you may be perfect and intire wanting nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That you may be intire.</hi> Some understand it thus, that you may <note place="margin">What is meant by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing.</note> be <hi>intire</hi> in respect of every grace, in respect of all gracious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, that you may have one grace as well as another, that as you have <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> so you may have <hi>patience</hi> too, that which is so necessary a grace for a Christian, as well as any other.</p>
                  <p>Others, by <hi>intirenesse</hi> here, and <hi>wanting nothing,</hi> thinke that the Apostlemeanes this, that they might have that which might sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply comfort to their soules in all their wants, A man is then said to <hi>want nothing,</hi> when he is content and satisfied with that estate wherein he is, as if he had all things: So <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>Ziglag</hi> was <note place="margin">1 Sam. 20. 6.</note> burnt, his Wives carried away captive, his souldiers began to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinie, and threaten him, yet neverthelesse he seemed to want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when he could <hi>comfort himselfe in the Lord his God. Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is great gaine;</hi> (but how?) <hi>with contentment,</hi> that is, there is such a sufficiency with contentment of heart, as if a man had the things he wants. So then here is the thing, <hi>that you may be intire,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of all gracious habits, necessary to the beeing of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that you may have that inward store and supply of comfort, that may support your hearts in all outward wants. Thus you have the meaning of the words.</p>
                  <p>The parts are two. <note place="margin">The parts of the text.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>An exhortation to duty.</p>
                  <p>An argument to enforce that exhortation.</p>
                  <p>The duty whereto they are exhorted is, that they should bee <hi>perfect in Patience, let Patience have her perfect worke.</hi>

                  <p>We will observe two Conclusions hence, which we shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low at this time. The first is this;</p>
                  <p>That Patience is necessarie to the perfection of a Christian. Or, A Christian is not perfect without patience. <note place="margin">Conclus. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second is this;</p>
                  <p>That every Christian should strive for a perfection of degrees of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. <note place="margin">Conclus. 2.</note> Or, that a Christian must labour to attaine the highest degree and perfection in Patience.</p>
                  <p>These two Conclusions we will handle apart in the Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14764:50"/>
and proofe, and joyne them together in the application and use.</p>
                  <p>For the first then, that <hi>A Christian is not perfect without patience.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Conclu.</hi> 1. A Christian not perfect without pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Mat. 5. 48.</note> Our Saviour exhorting his Disciples to patience (in the fifth of <hi>Matth.)</hi> because they should meet with many enemies, and injuries in the world, he concludeth, <hi>bee perfect</hi> (saith he) <hi>as your heavenly father is perfect.</hi> What <hi>perfection</hi> speakes he of here? Such a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> such a worke of Grace, as might inable them to carry themselves, as became them in the middest of those many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and opposites they should meet withall.</p>
                  <p>I will not stand upon this, I will endevour to make it appeare <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> to you. First it may appeare thus.</p>
                  <p>There is a twofold <hi>perfection</hi> of a Christian; There is a <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A twofold perfection of a Christian.</note> of parts, and a <hi>perfection</hi> of degrees. A child is a perfect man in respect of parts, but not in respect of degrees, because it is not come to that measure of strength (for that age is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it) which a man hath.</p>
                  <p>Now there is a necessitie that there should bee a <hi>perfection</hi> of parts.</p>
                  <p>First, the <hi>perfection</hi> of parts in a Christian, is but the making up <note place="margin">Perfection of parts what it is.</note> of all those graces which are necessarie to a Christian, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he cannot obey God, nor walke according to the rule: All these are necessarie: Now <hi>Patience</hi> is one of those parts, one of those habits of grace with which every renewed soule is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, and without which a man is not truly sanctified, without which a man expresseth himselfe not to be regenerate. And for this observe what the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>Adde moreover to your</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet, 1. 5, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>faith, vertue, to vertue knowledge, to knowledge temperance, to tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance patience, to patience godlinesse, to godlinesse brotherly kindnesse, to brotherly kindnesse love;</hi> What is the reason of of it? <hi>If these things bee in you and abound, you shall neither be idle, nor unfruitfull in the worke of the Lord.</hi> As if hee should say, you will bee idle and unfruitfull professors, unlesse that these graces bee in you, and abound in you. Now what are the Graces? you shall see the necessitie of every one of them; The Apostle exhorteth belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers there, to the <hi>giving all diligence to the making their calling and election sure,</hi> to make it certaine to themselves that they are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called. But might some say, there are many graces neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to a Christian, but there is one principall, which we call the radicall and maine grace of all, Faith? I but saith the Apostle, there are many others necessary besides that, as you must have faith towards God, so you must also carry your selves so, as may adorne your profession amongst men, therefore <hi>adde vertue to faith.</hi> But they might say, <hi>vertue,</hi> that is that that guideth a man in all Morralls, in all the course of his life and conversation?
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14764:51"/>
You shall have many provocations to sinne, therefore <hi>adde to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue temperance.</hi> But we have many discouragements to good? therefore <hi>adde to temperance Patience.</hi> But what though you should have both <hi>temperance and Patience,</hi> these are but morall vertues? Therefore <hi>adde to Patience godlinesse,</hi> that you may in all things you doe, ayme at God, and approve your selves to him. But when we have carried our selves in a holy manner, according to the rule and word of God, yet neverthelesse there are many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians that require offices of love from us, and what shall wee doe to these? Therefore <hi>adde to godlinesse brotherly kindnesse.</hi> But then againe beside that conversation we have with beleevers, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e are many men in the world that expect certaine duties from us? Therefore <hi>adde</hi> to that, <hi>Love,</hi> that extendeth to all men according to their necessities. So you see how the Apostle takes all graces, as it were into severall parcels, and sheweth how they cannot bee without one parcell of grace, they cannot goe through the course of Christianitie, except they have every thing: they cannot car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry themselves toward God without <hi>faith:</hi> they cannot adorne their profession without <hi>vertue;</hi> they cannot escape temptations without <hi>temperance;</hi> neither can they be encouraged against dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements without <hi>patience,</hi> Therefore he bringeth <hi>patience</hi> in amongst the rest, as a necessary part and dutie of a Christian without which hee cannot goe through the worke of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and religion.</p>
                  <p>Againe in the second place, as it appeareth by the parts of a <note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> Christian and Christianity, that a man cannot be perfect without <hi>Patience,</hi> so it appeareth by another argument, and that is this; A Christian cannot be perfect without that, without which hee cannot keepe that grace he hath. Looke what ever grace is in the soule, a man cannot keepe it without <hi>Patience. By Patience possesse</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 21. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>your soules.</hi> The soule which is the seate and subject of Grace, cannot it selfe be kept without <hi>Patience,</hi> therefore neither can any grace be kept in the soule without <hi>Patience:</hi> because as the riches and treasures in a Castle cannot be kept, when the walls are bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten downe, so those treasures of grace in the heart of man cannot be kept, when once <hi>patience,</hi> which is as the wall of the soule, that keepes it from the batterie of tentations, from the enemie that would steale them away while men sleepe; I say, unlesse these walls, these supporting graces, specially this of <hi>Patience</hi> be in the soule, it cannot stand intire.</p>
                  <p>For indeed let impatience once into the soule, and you let in all sinne with it; impatience is a destroying of all grace, a pulling downe of the wall. Nay, what is sinne indeed, but impatience in a sense? What is pride, but the impatience of humilitie? What is uncleannesse, but the impatience of chastitie? What is drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14764:51"/>
but the impatience of sobrietie? Every sinne beginneth in impatience, when a man cannot beare with that abstinence, and forbearance as formerly, cannot keepe that strict course in his wayes, but groweth impatient against the rule of God, he runneth into a course of sinne presently. So you see that for the very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the soule, the subject of grace, and grace the treasure of the soule, it is necessary that wee should have <hi>patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then againe thirdly; It will appeare thus to you, that a <note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> Christian cannot be perfect without <hi>patience,</hi> because hee cannot doe his worke without <hi>Patience,</hi> he cannot doe the workes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the taske that God layes upon him without <hi>Patience.</hi> Looke in what measure <hi>Patience</hi> is defective, in that measure hee halteth in his dutie, in the very actions of Religion hee goeth about.</p>
                  <p>Take any one duty of Religion that you can name, see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">No dutie can be rightly performed without pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Not Prayer.</note> a man can doe that without <hi>Patience.</hi> Suppose it be Prayer; How can a man goe on in the duty of prayer without <hi>Patience?</hi> Sometime God delayeth the grant of a mans petition: A man will now sinke, and give over in discouragement, if hee have not <hi>Patience</hi> to support the soule. The <hi>Canaanitish woman,</hi> when shee <note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> came to Christ, and spake once to him, and hee did not answer a word; she had so much <hi>Patience</hi> as to make her speake the second time to him, then he answered her, but churlishly; but yet her <hi>Patience</hi> held her to the third tryall, at last she received her desire: had she not beene <hi>patient</hi> to goe on with her request, shee had lost her petition. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor. 12. for this thing</hi> (saith <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12:</note> he) <hi>I besought the Lord thrice.</hi> Hee would have given over at the first seeking of the Lord, if he had not had <hi>Patience</hi> to uphold him to the second, and third petition, to the renewing of his suit twice, nay thrice.</p>
                  <p>Come from praying to hearing the Word preached; how can a <note place="margin">Not hearing.</note> man heare the word profitably without <hi>patience?</hi> therefore the good ground is said to heare the Word, and <hi>to bring forth fruit</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 8. 15. Rev. 3. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>with Patience:</hi> and it is the commendation of the Church of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, Thou hast kept the word of my Patience.</hi> There is a necessitie of <hi>Patience,</hi> if a man will profit by the Word.</p>
                  <p>For first if a man will obey the Word, he shall be sure to have many set against him in the world, he had need of <hi>patience</hi> then, or else he will leave the rule of the Word, because of the reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the world.</p>
                  <p>Againe, there are many secret corruptions in his owne heart that will be met with in the preaching of the Word, which a man cannot abide to heare of, but hee will be vexing and fretting, and discontented at it (as we see in <hi>Ahab</hi> and divers others) unlesse hee have <hi>Patience</hi> to keepe him from raging against the Preacher, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14764:52"/>
preaching of the Word. You <hi>have need of Patience</hi> then (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>as the <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 36.</note> Apostle saith) that you may beare the reproofes, and exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Word. Therefore saith the Apostle <hi>Iames, Receive</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>with Patience the ingraffed Word, or receive with meeknesse, the ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed Word, that is able to save your soules.</hi> There is no ingrafting the Word in the heart, except those formes of impatience, those hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances of the growth of the Word be taken away.</p>
                  <p>But further, there is yet a further end: the whole life of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is a continuall exercise of <hi>Patience,</hi> there is a necessitie of it, <note place="margin">Reas. 4.</note> for he cannot persevere without <hi>Patience,</hi> it is impossible for a man to begin in the spirit, but he shall end in the flesh, if he have not <hi>Patience</hi> to persevere in well doing, Therefore saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>You have need of Patience, that after you have obeyed, you might receive the promise.</hi> You have need of <hi>Patience,</hi> for betweene the time of the making of the Promise, and the time of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the Promise to the soule, there is a great distance many times, therefore <hi>yee have need of Patience,</hi> to waite, that <hi>after you have obeyed the Word, you might receive the promise. Let us runne with Patience the race that is set before us, looking to Iesus the Authour,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>and finisher of our faith.</hi> Our Lord Jesus himselfe had not perfected the worke of our redemption, if he had wanted <hi>Patience:</hi> neither can we finish our course of Christianity (wherein we must follow Christ) and <hi>runne the race that is set before us,</hi> except we have <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> added to other graces.</p>
                  <p>You see then a Christian cannot be perfect without <hi>Patience;</hi> First, because he cannot have all the parts of Christianitie, that is one thing. Secondly, because he cannot keepe and preserve the graces he hath, that is another thing. Thirdly, because he cannot act and worke according to the rule, that is the third. Lastly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he cannot persevere in the course he is in, except hee have <hi>Patience.</hi> There is a necessitie of <hi>Patience</hi> to the perfection of a Christian.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the second point was, that it is the duty of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to strive to bring <hi>patience</hi> to the uttermost perfection, to be as <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Conclus.</hi> 2. A Christian must labour for perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Coll. 1. 11.</note> perfect in the degrees of <hi>patience</hi> as he can attaine to, to make this the strife of his life, that <hi>patience</hi> may have her perfect worke, that there may be no defect in it. The Apostle prayeth for the <hi>Collos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> that <hi>they may be strengthned in the inward man to all long suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</hi> And when our Saviour setteth God as a patterne before men, <hi>Bee you perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect;</hi> What ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <note place="margin">Mat 5. 48.</note> he at in that place but this? that we should strive to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost extent, and highest degrees of <hi>Patience,</hi> for our Saviour intendeth of <hi>patience</hi> in that place. This then is the dutie of a Christian.</p>
                  <p>Why so?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:14764:52"/>
First, because a Christian is to follow the best patterne: the <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> best patternes are propounded in the Scripture. And God doth not propound examples and Patternes to men in vaine: but as he giveth them rules to tell them what they should doe, so he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them examples and patternes to lead them to that degree, and direct them in the manner of doing. Therefore yee have God himselfe set as a patterne of <hi>Patience: Follow God as deare children;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 5:</note> wherein? In all those examples wherein you have a rule. For all the examples of God, and Christ, and the Saints, binde no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then there is a rule in the Word. There are many things wherein we cannot follow God and Christ, and we need not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low every one of the Saints; but those things that are injoyned by the rule, these examples are set to direct us in obedience to that rule. Among other things, the <hi>Patience</hi> of God is set forth as a patterne for us to follow. In that glorious proclamation made of him, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 7. 8. Among other of his attributes, hee is set out to bee <hi>a God long suffering and Patient. You see how patient</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 34. 7. Rom. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>God is</hi> (saith the Apostle.) <hi>And God that hee might shew his long-suffering and Patience, bore with the world,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> With what world? <hi>with the world of ungodly men.</hi> God hath borne with <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 2 Pt. 2:</note> the world many Ages of yeares, many thousand yeares already, and yet beareth still with the world. The most holy God that perfectly hateth wickednesse, yet to shew his <hi>Patience,</hi> he beareth with <hi>ungodly ones:</hi> Yea, and he beareth with men too: the mighty God, that is able to destroy all the world, with the very breath of his mouth, that as with a word hee made the world, so with a blast he is able to bring it to nothing, yet this mighty God bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with men, this holy God with ungodly men; yea, and this God that might suddenly destroy the earth, as hee did the old World with water, he beareth so many thousand yeares with the world of ungodly men, that his <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>long-suffering</hi> may appeare. You have God for an example then.</p>
                  <p>And Christ for an example too: and <hi>you are predestinated for</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>this very end, to be like the Image of the Sonne,</hi> to be made conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto Christ; Wherein? In all imitable and necessary graces. I say, in all those graces that are necessary, by vertue of a rule, and that are imitable, wherein we may or can follow him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest this is one, his <hi>Patience.</hi> See the <hi>Patience</hi> of Christ. In his carriage toward his Father, how he bore the displeasure of his Father: In his carriage toward men, when hee might have commanded <hi>fire from heaven,</hi> yet you see how hee bore with them, and rebuked his Disciples, <hi>You know not of what spirit you are.</hi>

my brethren</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Iames) the Prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an ensample of suffering affliction, and of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">James 5. 10.</note> The Prophets suffered long, and endured the frownes of the world, and the rage of Princes, they endured a thousand mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, and all to discharge their duty. But amongst all the servants of God, <hi>You have heard of the Patience of Iob, and what end the Lord</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">verse 11.</note> 
                     <hi>made with him.</hi> Every man can speake of the <hi>patience</hi> of <hi>Iob,</hi> but this was written for our ensample, to teach us to be patient as hee was: <hi>Whatsoever things were written afore-time, were written for our</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>learnings, that wee through Patience, and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe secondly, as it is necessary for a Christian to strive for the <note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> perfection of <hi>Patience</hi> in the degrees of it, because of the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie that should be betweene him, and those examples of God, of Christ, and of the Saints, betweene God the Father, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers his children; betweene Christ the head, and beleevers his members; betweene the Saints of God, children of the same Father, and servants of the same Master, that should honour him in the same grace of <hi>Patience.</hi> So there is a necessitie likewise of it, in respect of the tryals whereunto a Christian may be put: you had need to strive that you may be <hi>perfect in Patience,</hi> because you know not what tryals yee shall be put to, what times yee are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to. Every man must expect troubles and afflictions, they are called <hi>Tribulations,</hi> and you know what <hi>Tribulum</hi> was, the Iron ball that was full of pikes round about, so that wheresoever it was cast it did sticke; an Engine used in warre: Tribulations are unavoydable, they will fall and sticke, yee cannot escape them on any side, by any turning to the right hand, or to the left. <hi>It is</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Acts 14 22. 2 Tim. 3. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>the will of God, that through many tribulations wee should enter into the kingdome of heaven: and whosoever will live Godly in Christ Iesus must suffer persecution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now (beloved) is this so, that this is a Statute in heaven, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, and ordained by God, and will not be reversed, like the lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> that every man must passe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven through tribulation, and affliction upon earth; then it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes every one to be armed, to get such a measure of <hi>patience,</hi> as may support him in such afflictions. Yee know not what affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions yee may have, what particular tryals God may put yee to: In what a miserable case then is a man, if he be to seeke of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, when he is in the middest of the pikes; if he be then to get <hi>patience,</hi> when he is in the middest of tryals, when he is disturbed and distracted with vexation of spirit? What foolish disorderly speeches proceed from men in the time of affliction? We may see it in <hi>David, so foolish was I and ignorant, and in this point a beast before</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 73. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>thee.</hi> What foolish, sensuall, beastly speeches, unreasonable ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:14764:53"/>
passages proceed from men in those times of trouble, if they have not got to themselves before hand this grace, and are not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Christian caraiage in time by <hi>patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus yee see the necessitie of <hi>patience</hi> to the perfection of a Christian, and the necessitie of the perfection of <hi>patience,</hi> to the ornament of a Christian.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to make use of both these together. First, it <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. For reproofe.</note> serveth for the just reproofe of Christians that are carefull for other parts, and acts of religion, and are not so seriously mindfull of this duty of <hi>Patience</hi> as they should be, but are so farre from striving for <hi>patience,</hi> that they seeme rather to strive for impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that make their crosses more heavy, and their afflictions more bitter then they would be. Indeed we make Gods Cuppe (that of it selfe is grievous enough to nature and to sense) by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into it our owne ingredients, that are inbred in our owne passions, and pride and selfe-will, and our owne earthly mindes, farre more bitter then else it would be.</p>
                  <p>But how doth a man make afflictions worse?</p>
                  <p>There are divers wayes that men take, wherein they are so farre <note place="margin">W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ies how men increase impatience in themselues.</note> from perfecting <hi>patience</hi> in themselves, that they wholly destroy <hi>patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first is, by their agravating of their afflictions, by all the severall circumstances that possibly they can invent. All their <note place="margin">1. By aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</note> eloquence is used in expressing the grievousnesse of that crosse and affliction that is upon them. They that in the times of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy could scarse ever drop a word in thankfulnesse, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of Gods goodnesse to them, now they can poure out flouds of sentences in expression of Gods bitter, and heavie dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with them in such afflictions, and crosses, and distresses that befall them. As the Church speakes in the <hi>Lamentations; Consider all that passe by, is there any Affliction like my affliction, wherewith the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Lam. 1. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord hath afflicted me?</hi> The like speech you have ordinarily in the mouthes of persons; Is there any affliction like mine? there is no body so wronged in their name as I; nor hath such paine in their body, nor never went with such a heavy heart as I; never any man suffered so many injuries by friends and enemies, and all sorts of people, as I have done: as if all the afflictions in the world, the flouds and waves of tryals, were all met upon one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. This is the language of men, whereby they aggravate their afflictions, and increase impatience in themselves.</p>
                  <p>Againe, another way whereby they doe it, is this; By giving vent and free course to their passions. Passions are like a wilde <note place="margin">2. By giving liberty to their passions.</note> horse, if they have not reines put upon them, if they be not pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in, they will flie out to all excesse. If once we give our Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vent, there is no stopping of them. <hi>David,</hi> wee see, checks
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:14764:54"/>
himselfe, he had a curbe to bridle his passions; <hi>Why art thou cast downe, oh my soule?</hi> But otherwise when men give the reines to their passion, and doe not stop their course, but thinke they have reason for it, they breake out into all exorbitancie. <hi>Ionah,</hi> when the Lord chalenged him for his anger, <hi>Dost thou well to bee angrie? I</hi> (saith he) <hi>I doe well to be angrie even to the death.</hi> So <hi>David, Oh Absalom, my sonne, would God I had died for thee; oh Absalom, my sonne, my sonne.</hi> What hurt was done to <hi>David?</hi> what wrong had the man to take on thus? his sonne was tooke from him; but it was <hi>Absalom: Absalom</hi> died, but it was <hi>Absolom</hi> that would have killed his father: and yet he takes on, as if the father could not live, because the sonne that sought his death, was tooke from him. Such unreasonable Passions, such causelesse distempers oft-times are in the soules of men, that they mistake Gods wayes, and that very way that he intendeth them good in, they complaine of, as if it were their utter undoing.</p>
                  <p>Againe thirdly, another way whereby men increase their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience <note place="margin">3. By refusing comfort.</note> and distemper, is, when they will not give way to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: they will not onely bee exceeding vehement, and intent upon their Passions, but besides, stop all passages and in-lets, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst comfort; It was <hi>Iacobs</hi> fault concerning the death of <hi>Ioseph:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 37. 34.</note> When he heard that <hi>Ioseph</hi> was dead, not onely his heart sunke within him, but hee rends his garments, and covereth himselfe with sack-cloth, he takes on so, that when his sonnes and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren rose up to comfort him, he would not be comforted: Why? Because <hi>Ioseph</hi> was not, and <hi>I will goe to the grave to Ioseph:</hi> nothing would comfort <hi>Iacob,</hi> but he would goe <hi>downe to the grave to Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> by all meanes. What a great matter was this? He only heard that <hi>Ioseph</hi> was dead, he was alive, he knew not so much, but hee heard a present sound of feare, and he was carried away with that. So it is with us, the very apprehension of our feares are as bad to us, as the things themselves could possibly be. Nay, we multiply upon our selves, our feares, and we will not heare counsell and comfort, as <hi>Rachel, that mourned for her children, and would not bee comforted, because they were not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, a fourth thing whereby men increase impatience in themselves, and aggravate their sorrowes, is this, when men <note place="margin">4. By looking only on affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, not on mercies.</note> looke onely upon the present afflictions, and not upon the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies they have: as if they had but one eye to behold all objects with, as if they could looke but upon one thing at once: there should bee a looking upon the affliction, and there should bee a looking upon the mercy too. This was <hi>Hamans</hi> case: when he was vexed that <hi>Mordecay</hi> did not doe him reverence, all his wealth and his honours could doe him no good: he had much wealth, and the <hi>glory of his house was increased,</hi> he had the favour
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14764:54"/>
of the King, and was inclining to have the honour of the Queene put upon him; <hi>yet all this availeth me nothing</hi> (saith he) <hi>so long as I see</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Est. 5. 13:</note> 
                     <hi>Mordecay the Iew sitting in the Kings gate.</hi> Hee lookes onely on this particular that vexed and grieved him, and not upon the rest. So it is with us, if there be but one particular affliction upon us, we fix our eyes upon that: Like a Flie, that flieth about the glasse, and can sticke no where till she come to some cracke: or as a Gnat that commeth about the body of a beast, that will be sure to sticke on the galled part, or some sore or other. So it is with these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted thoughts of men, that are of no other use, but to further Sathans ends, to weaken their faith, and discourage their owne hearts; men sticke on the gall, on the sore of any affliction, there they will rest. It is true, God hath given us such and such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and mercies, hath offered us such and such opportunities, but what is this? this and that particular affliction is upon me. This is that, that increaseth impatience, when a man will not looke on the mercies he receiveth, but onely lookes on that that he wanteth.</p>
                  <p>Againe, a fifth course that men take to aggravate their sorrows, <note place="margin">5. By looking on the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not on God.</note> and increase impatience in themselves is this. They looke upon the instrument of their sorrows and afflictions, but never looke up to God that ruleth, and over-ruleth these things; Men looke upon such a person, such a man and no more. Yee see how <hi>David</hi> was disquieted at this: <hi>If it had beene an enemie that reproached him, then he could have borne it;</hi> but it was <hi>thou my friend, my equall, my</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 55. 12. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>guide, my acquaintance that sate at my table, wee tooke sweet counsell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and walked unto the house of God in company;</hi> This troubled him; and see how he multiplied his sorrowes, when hee looked upon the instrument, till he looked upon God, and then <hi>I was dumbe, I opened not my mouth, because thou didst it.</hi> There is no quiet <note place="margin">Psal. 39. 9.</note> in the heart, when a man lookes upon man, till hee lookes upon God that ordereth all things by his wisedome and counsell.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, men aggravate their sorrowes, and increase their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, <note place="margin">6. By looking on the smart and not on the benefit of affliction.</note> by another course they take, that is, when they looke on their sorrows and afflictions onely, and not upon the benefit of affliction: they looke only upon that that flesh would avoyde, but not that which if they were spirituall and wise they would desire. <hi>No affliction</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>is joyous for the time,</hi> that <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 11.</note> is, to flesh and nature, <hi>but grievous, neverthelesse, afterward it yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the peaceable fruit of righteousnesse to them which are exercised there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</hi> Now men looke upon that only which is grievous in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon the smart of it, but not upon the profit of Affliction, the quiet fruit of righteousnesse that commeth by it. As a man when he hath a Corroding plaister put to a sore, he cryeth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of the smart it putteth him to, but takes no notice of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14764:55"/>
healing that commeth by it, and the cure that followeth. Thus it is with men, they complaine of God, as if he envied them the comfort of their lives, as if he intended to robbe them of all conveniencies, and to make them utterly miserable, to begin a Hell with them on earth, when they never looke how God by this meanes fitteth them for heaven, by this meanes purging out corruption, and strengthening grace in them: <hi>Wee are afflicted of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>the Lord, that we may not be condemned of the world;</hi> Men looke upon the affliction, not upon their freedome from condemnation.</p>
                  <p>So much for that. I come now to a second use.</p>
                  <p>You see here the way whereby men aggravate afflictions, and get causes of impatience in themselves, and if we seriously consider it, wee shall find one of these, the ordinary causes of all distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and impatience in losses, in sicknesses, in distresse of mind, in crosses upon a mans name, or whatsoever befalleth him amisse in the world, that which makes him flie out, that which makes him, that he cannot submit unto God, it is some of these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars here spoken of.</p>
                  <p>Let it therefore in the second place, stirre us up every one in <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. For exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the presence of God to set our selves upon this taske of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, to labour for <hi>Patience,</hi> that we may be perfect Christians, and to be perfect in Patience, <hi>Let Patience have her perfect worke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all the question is, how a man may get it.</p>
                  <p>As there are two sorts of afflictions in a mans life, so <hi>Patience</hi> hath two offices. One affliction is, those present evils that a man undergoeth and suffereth, here <hi>Patience</hi> is to support him in those present miseries and calamities.</p>
                  <p>Another sort of tryall is, when the good that a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects is delayed, and is not presently granted, and here <hi>patience</hi> is necessarie in this case also. I will shew yee how a man may set <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> a worke in both these, and so conclude.</p>
                  <p>First, for the present calamities of a mans life, (For crosses of <note place="margin">How to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent crosses.</note> any kind, in name, state, friends, or familie, or in whatsoever a man hath, or goeth about they may all be reduced to this one head) when a man commeth from a state of health to a state of sicknesse; from a state of comfort to a state of sorrow; from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and societie, to be as a <hi>Pelican in the wildernesse</hi> (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> speakes) destitute of all friends and helpes; from inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in his heart, in the assurance of Gods love, to spirituall disertions, wherein he seemeth to be as in a cloude, under the frownes of God. When a man is in this case, how shall he exercise <hi>patience?</hi> how shall he come to it?</p>
                  <p>Briefly, the way for a man to get <hi>patience</hi> in such cases as these is this. <note place="margin">1. Consider God the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of all conditions. Therefore</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First to consider, that there is no change in my life, there is no
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14764:55"/>
condition whatsoever that I am cast into, but it is ordered by God. Set thy soule aworke now, to give God his glory in that change of thy life. First give God the glory of his absolute So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and Dominion. Secondly, give him the glory of his wisdome. Thirdly, give him the glory of his mercy in those changes of thy life that seeme most grievous to thee.</p>
                  <p>First, I say, give him the glory of his absolute soveraignty. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <note place="margin">give him the glory of his soveraignty.</note> him an absolute in-dependant Lord, that doth what he will among the creatures. His will is the rule of all his actions upon the creatures here below, and uncontrould, unquestionable. It is high arrogancy, and presumption, and pride of spirit, for the creature to contest with his Creator, concerning his actions on earth. Let every man reason thus; I must give God the glory of his Soveraignty, and acknowledge that he hath power and right, to rule all the <hi>families of the earth;</hi> and why not mine as well as another? Why not my person as well as anothers? Why not to order all the changes of my life, as well as another mans? That which <hi>Benhadad</hi> spake proudly to <hi>Ahab, thy silver, and thy gold, thy</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 20. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>wives and thy children, and thy house, and thy Citie are mine;</hi> That may God speake truely, and by right; All that thou hast, and all that thou art, is mine, therefore give him that glory that <hi>Iob</hi> did in the change of his life; <hi>The Lord hath given, the Lord hath taken</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job 1. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>away, blessed bee the name of the Lord.</hi> The Lord that gave hath right to take what he will. There is nothing that will keepe the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his due place, but the consideration of Gods absolute so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigntie. This consideration was that that meekned the spirit of <hi>Eli,</hi> when that heavy message was brought to him, that there <note place="margin">1 Sam. 3. 18.</note> should come such miserie upon his house that <hi>whosoever heard it, both his eares should tingle,</hi> well, saith he, <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe what seemeth him good:</hi> It is the Lord, and it becommeth not ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to stand and contend with their Lord. So <hi>David,</hi> when the <note place="margin">2 Sam. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>. 25</note> Priests offered him their service to goe along with him to the field from <hi>Absolom; If</hi> (saith he) <hi>I shall find favour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me back to Ierusalem, and his tabernacle, but if he thus say, I have no delight in thee, behold here am I, let him doe to mee as seemeth good unto him.</hi> Here was that that humbled the spirit of <hi>David,</hi> when he considered that he was under the hands of an absolute Lord, let the Lord do with me what seemeth him good.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as thou must give him the glory of his soveraignty, <note place="margin">Of his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> so of his wisedome. Know that God <hi>ordereth all his wayes with wisedome</hi> and counsell; he knoweth what is good for his children. Yee are content when yee are sicke, that the Phisitian should diet yee, because yee account him wise, and one that hath skill in that course. If God diet thee for the purging out of some corruption, and for the curing of some spirituall disease in thy soule, submit
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14764:56"/>
to God in this case, be willing to resigne thy selfe up to be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him. A man that hath a Gangreene, or such a dangerous disease in his body, submitteth to the Surgeon in his course, though it be to the cutting and sawing off of a limbe, though it bee never so painfull, and the losse be never so great, yet hee is (for the saving of his life) willing to have that taken away. God is a wise God, that knoweth what estate is best for thee; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when tryals are better then comforts, but what one kind of tryall is better then another: it may be it is better to exercise one with povertie, another with disgrace, another with spirituall trouble, another with restraint of libertie, which particular try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all is necessary to cure that disease, and which this, that is in my soule: the heavenly Phisitian will bring that upon thee as a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall prescription, and a heavenly course that he takes in infinite wisdome to cure thee.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, give him in all this the glory of his mercie. What hast thou lost, but thou maiest have lost a great deale more? What <note place="margin">Of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> dost thou suffer, but thou maiest have suffered a great deale more? As <hi>Alcibiades</hi> when he was told that one had stolne halfe his plate, <hi>I have cause</hi> (saith he) <hi>rather to bee thankefull that hee tooke no more, then to be troubled that he tooke so much;</hi> I am sure it is true of God in this case: what hath God tooke from thee? some part of thy estate, some friend, some comfort of thy life, some one or other particular comfort: could he not have done more? Hee afflicteth thee in thy body, hee might have afflicted thee in thy soule, and <hi>a wounded spirit who can beare?</hi> Hee hath afflicted thee in some one member of thy body, he could have <hi>cast body and soule into Hell.</hi> There is not a tryall upon thee, but God could have made it hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier: let that make thee therefore to submit with a more meeke heart, and willing spirit to God, as a mercifull God: as the Church in the Lamentations; <hi>It is the Lords mercy that wee are not consumed:</hi> the Church was in great affliction, when the Babiloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <note place="margin">Lam. 1.</note> came upon them, and they were driven from the house of God, and their owne houses, but yet <hi>it was Gods mercy that they were not consumed.</hi> So the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> telleth <hi>Baruch</hi> in the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, <note place="margin">Ier. 45. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Seekest thou great things for thy selfe? thou shalt have thy life for a prey: Baruch</hi> was wondrously disquieted, he complained that the <hi>Lord had added griefe to his sorrow;</hi> What griefe was that? that <hi>Hee must goe to Egypt,</hi> and after <hi>to Babylon;</hi> Well saith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, thy case is not so heavy, as thou seemest to make it, <hi>thou shalt have thy life for a prey, in all places wheresoever thou goest.</hi> God might have taken away life and all, but <hi>thy life thou shalt have for a prey;</hi> Therefore be content with so much. So I say to thee, when great afflictions come upon thee, they might have beene greater, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore consider that, that thou maiest give God the glory of his
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:14764:56"/>
mercy. And so much for the first direction; that is, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God in all the changes of life that befalleth thee.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, looke to sinne, as that deserving cause that draweth on <note place="margin">2. Consider the desert of sinne.</note> all the afflictions of this life. Consider, thou hast fallen by thy sinne into Gods displeasure, therefore whatsoever affliction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falleth thee, thy sinne hath deserved that at the hands of God. The Lord now dealeth with thee as a just God; though not in the extremity of rigour, yet neverthelesse there is a righteous proceeding in it, as the Church confesseth; <hi>Righteousnesse belongeth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 9. Ezra. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>to thee, O Lord,</hi> though they were in great affliction, yet God was righteous in it. It is profitable to consider this, nay, and not only that thou sufferest righteously, (as the Theefe on the Crosse said, <hi>Wee suffer according to our deserts)</hi> but thou sufferest not so much as thy sinnes deserve; thy sinnes deserve greater things at the hands of God, then yet he hath infflicted on thee. Wee see, that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation, and change of punishment, a lesse for a greater, hath the place of a mercy upon a malefactor that deserveth greater, when he deserveth to be executed and to die, he is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be burnt in the hand, but he confesseth it to be a mercy of the Prince. So it is with us, whatsoever affliction God hath lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on thee, thou maist conclude, I have deserved greater. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, saith the Church, <hi>Why is the living man sorrowfull? Man suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Lam. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>for his sinne, let us search and trie our wayes, and turne againe to the Lord.</hi> So let this be the maine businesse of thy life in this case, rather bethinke thy selfe how to get the favour of God, then to be eased of such a trouble. Let a man looke to sin in all this.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, consider the gracious and comfortable fruit of Affliction <note place="margin">3. Consider the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table fruit of affliction borne with <hi>patience.</hi>
                     </note> that is born with <hi>patience:</hi> For first <hi>patience</hi> lesseneth the judgement, impatience increaseth it on a man. The strugling child hath more stripes; A man in a Fever, the more he strugleth and striveth, the more he increaseth his paine. The more <hi>patiently</hi> a man yeeldeth himselfe to the hands of God, the more (by the mercy of God) he findeth ease, and mittigation of the affliction. And this God <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 10:</note> promiseth, <hi>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee in the time of trouble.</hi> God will take off the affliction, when once he hath perfected <hi>Patience</hi> by affliction: for you must know this, that all that God aymeth at in all afflictions that hee layeth on men, is to perfect <hi>patience</hi> in them: therefore the issue will be good. There will for the present be more ease to the heart, and afterward a gracious issue and deliverance from trouble, when thou art <hi>exercised by patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, there are otherafflictions of our life, and that is not <note place="margin">How to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise patience in Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying of mercies.</note> onely in those cases wherein some positive evell, as wee account it naturally, some affliction grievous to nature and sense are upon a man: but mercies are delayed, <hi>and hope deferred makes the heart
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14764:57"/>
faint.</hi> It is an affliction to a man, to be kept and delayed in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of that good he hath not: if he seeme to catch at it, it is drawne from him further and further. There are many men that have sent many a prayer to God, yet the thing they aske is not granted to this day: Many a man hath waited long, and sought the Lord, yet he hath not that his soule desireth. How shall a man come to exercise <hi>Patience</hi> in such a case as this?</p>
                  <p>In such a case when God delayeth, know first that Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes <note place="margin">1. Consider that delayes are not deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</note> are not denyals: though God delay the thing, hee may and wil in time certainly grant it, yea though he delay it a great while: As we see in other servants of God, we may see it in <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Iob,</hi> in <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Canaanitish woman, and in others; <hi>The Vision is for an appointed time</hi> (saith <hi>Habakkuk) waite for it, it will come, and it will not tarrie, it will not lie.</hi> God will bee knowne a God of truth, what he hath promised he will performe in due time: only what doth he expect of thee? to waite for the present. Now this is an act of faith; <hi>Hee that beleeveth will not make hast.</hi> Glorifie God by beleeving, <hi>put to thy seale that hee is true:</hi> Whatsoever God hath promised in the Word, and thou hast a warrant to beleeve, waite for it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods delayes are not onely not denyals, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements <note place="margin">2. That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies increase mercies.</note> of Gods favour; God increaseth and commendeth the excellencies of his mercies by delayes, hee recompenceth our expectation, and waiting for them with putting in greater sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse into those favours when they come: I say, God increaseth the comfort answerable to the delay, as in the 61. <hi>Isa.</hi> 7. God to <note place="margin">Isa. 61. 7.</note> comfort the distressed Church in the time of calamitie, <hi>for their affliction</hi> (saith he) <hi>they shall have double;</hi> Double what? Double comforts for their tryals; <hi>Our light afflictions</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>that are but for a moment, cause us a farre more excellent and surpassing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>weight of glory.</hi> A weight of glory for light Afflictions, an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall weight of glory for momentany afflictions. Here is the issue; <hi>As our afflictions have abounded, so our consolations abound much more.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.</note> This is the course of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, know that Gods delayes are never long: at the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <note place="margin">3. That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies are but short, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> they are but for a short time: what if he delay a yeare? what if twenty, thirty, fourty yeares? what if the life of a man? this is no great delay. Compare this time of thy waiting for mercie, with the time to come of thy enjoying of mercie. A small time of waiting on earth, to an eternitie of recompence in heaven. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare eternitie with the time of thy suffering. Alas how little, what a small or no agreement is betweene them? A moment to eternitie. If the life of a man should extend to a hundred yeares, to a thousand yeares (to which age never man yet lived) yet that is but a point, a moment, to eternitie. A <hi>thousand yeares</hi> past and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:14764:57"/>
to come, <hi>they are but as yester-day to God,</hi> Take the eternity past, in God himselfe that is without all beginning, and the eternitie to come, that shall be without all end, and put the life of man in the middest of these two, and we will conclude, it is as a point in the middest of a circumference, it is but a moment; nay, not so much as a moment of time. Stretch out the dutie of <hi>Patience</hi> then; hast thou waited a weeke? waite a moneth, a yeare, seven yeares, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventie yeares, nay seventie Ages, all the ages of the world if it were possible; All these are but a moment to eternitie.</p>
                  <p>And where is there a man that hath waited so long, but God, that his servants may not faint in their expectation, either sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them with other comforts, lest they should faint in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, or else giveth them that which they desire before their hearts faint. Know therefore, that it is no such great matter for a man to waite upon God, it is but a short time: and resolve in the time of thy waiting upon this, that when thou art fittest for mercie, it shall come, and when it commeth, it shall come with an abundant waight and sweetnesse, such as shall countervaile all thy expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and waiting.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have told you how men should exercise patience by exercising their faith: and how they should strengthen patience by hope: and how they should perfect <hi>patience</hi> by selfe-denyall.</p>
                  <p>The reason why I tooke this Text for the present occasion is, that there might be a concurrence betweene the rule and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. Here is the rule, <hi>Let patience have her perfect worke, that you may be perfect, and intire wanting nothing.</hi> One reason among others was this, because wee know not what changes and tryalls, God hath reserved any of us to, therefore we <hi>had need of Patience.</hi> Our Sister here is the example; a patterne to others of those tryals of life, wherto a Christian may be exposed even to extremitie. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it pleased God to give many other mercies to her, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse she had a continual exercise of <hi>patience,</hi> in extream anguish of body, in a vexing tormenting paine, that a long time, for many yeares together held her under such extremitie of torture, that a man on the racke, or in any other extremity, could hardly have greater torments then she sometime felt, in the time of that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity upon her. God laid this affliction upon her to <hi>perfect</hi> her <hi>Patience,</hi> and that she might be a patterne of <hi>Patience</hi> to you, that you might studie and pray for <hi>Patience,</hi> and endevour after it, that when afflictions fall upon any of you, you may not be found wanting, and destitute of <hi>Patience.</hi> So much for this time.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese words containe <hi>Davids</hi> answer to a <note place="margin">Coherence.</note> question that was put to him (in the verse going before the Text) by some of his servants. The question was grounded upon their observation of his divers car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, when the child was sicke, and when the child was dead. When the child was sicke <hi>hee fasted, and wept, and lay upon the ground, and prayed;</hi> When the child was dead, he forbeareth, <hi>weeping, washeth himselfe, calleth for bread,</hi> &amp;c. And now they aske him the reason, for they thought rather that hee would have exprest a greater sorrow, then he had done before, as it may bee discerned in the consultation among themselves: every man was loth to tell <hi>David</hi> of the great losse that was befallen him, that his child was dead. When he heard of it, and altereth his carriage, and sheweth himselfe more chearefull, contrary to their expectation; they plainly put the question to him, What should be the reason of this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:14764:60"/>
The words I have read to yee, are an Answer to that question. Hee telleth them the reason, both of his fasting, and weeping in the time of the sicknesse of the child, and of his calling for meat, and forbearing to weepe now at the death of the childe.</p>
                  <p>The reason of his former carriage, he giveth in the 22 verse; <hi>While the childe was yet alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, whether the Lord may bee gracious to mee, that the child may live?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reason of the alteration of his carriage, why he exprest himselfe in another manner, upon the death of the childe, hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in the 23. verse. <hi>But now, hee is dead, wherefore should I fast? I shall returne to him, hee shall not returne to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the former part (the reason of his sad and mournfull carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, <note place="margin">Division.</note> during the time of the sicknesse of the child, <hi>then</hi> (saith he) <hi>I did fast.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yee have first the declaration of his action, and behaviour, and carriage at that time; <hi>While the childe was yet alive, I fasted and wept.</hi> And the reason of this action and carriage, <hi>for I said, Who can tell whether the Lord will be gracious to mee that the child may live?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall be briefe in speaking of this part only.</p>
                  <p>First for his carriage, <hi>I fasted and wept.</hi> These are but externall <note place="margin">1. <hi>Davids</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage during his childes sicknesse. Meaning of the Words. 1 Cor. 8. 8. Rom. 14. 17.</note> actions: fasting, of it selfe, is not a worship of God, but as it helpeth and furthereth another end, as it helpeth a man in prayer, as it furthereth, the worke of humiliation, and declareth that; <hi>For neither if wee eate are wee the better, nor if wee eate not, are wee the worse,</hi> as the Apostle speakes; <hi>And the kingdome of God consisteth not in meat and drinke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a fast inforced by necessitie, that which either is by sicknesse or want, and is meerely civill and outward, without any respect to God. And there is a fast too, which hath a pretence of respect to God, which is not acceptable, as that of the Pharisees, that rested only in the externall action. There is a fast that is reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and accepted of God, and that is that which is both a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the inward humiliation of the soule, as also a helpe and furtherance of it. Such a fast was this that <hi>David</hi> speakes of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Davids</hi> Fast a religious fast.</note> here. A Fast that did arise from a sense of his unworthinesse of the creature, and did expresse the sorrow of his heart for sinne; A Fast which he did set upon only for this end, that he might be more free, and more fit for prayer.</p>
                  <p>And so likewise for the mourning, and weeping, he speakes of. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Davids</hi> tears proceeded not from a naturall,</note> It was not such a weeping as ariseth meerely from the temper of the body, as in some that are more apt for teares: Nor a weeping that did arise from the distemper of the mind, such as those curst, froward, passionate, vexing, fretting teares, are; such as the teares of <hi>Esau</hi> to his father, <hi>hee lift up his voyce and wept, hast thou not one
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:14764:60"/>
blessing more? blesse mee, even me also, oh my father.</hi> But they were teares that did arise from a holy affection, from a gracious dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition <note place="margin">but from a spirituall principle.</note> of heart, from inward contrition and sorrow; like the teares that <hi>Peter shed, when hee went out and wept bitterly.</hi> They were teares that discovered the inward vehemency of his spirit in prayer: like those teares of <hi>Iacob,</hi> when he wrestled with the Angell; the <note place="margin">Gen. 32. Hose. 12.</note> Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> telleth how he wrestled, <hi>hee prayed and wept.</hi> Such teares were these; as did expresse the fervencie of his spirit in prayer, the earnestnesse of his desire, in putting up this request he had now to God: like those of <hi>Hezekiah; I have heard thy prayer,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>and seene thy teares,</hi> saith God: such teares as God <hi>putteth into his bottle:</hi> such teares as hee takes speciall notice of. There are no teares that are shed for sinne, out of an inward sorrow of heart, that are shed in prayer, to expresse a holy desire, that proceed from an inward inflamed affection and fervency of spirit, but they are very precious with God: as farre (I say) as they declare the inward truth of the heart, and the inward sense of our wants, and the weight of the petitions we put up to God. Such were these teares here: <hi>I fasted and wept.</hi> I will not stand upon this.</p>
                  <p>The reason of this action, why he fasted and wept. I did it for <note place="margin">2. The reason of <hi>Davids</hi> carriage.</note> this end, <hi>for</hi> (saith he) <hi>I said, who knoweth whether the Lord will bee gracious to mee, that the childe may live?</hi> A man may wonder if he read the former part of the chapter, whence this perswasion and hope should come into the heart of <hi>David,</hi> that there should be a possibility of having the life of this child by his prayer, whereas the Lord had said before by <hi>Nathan</hi> to him, <hi>that the child should die. Nathan</hi> had told him in expresse tearmes that the child should die, yet he putteth up his prayer for it, and said, <hi>Who knoweth whether the Lord will bee gracious to me, that the child may live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We must know therefore that God sometime, even in those <note place="margin">Gods abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute sentence implies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</note> sentences that seeme absolute, implies, and intends a condition. <hi>David</hi> had respect to such a course as God ordinarily tooke: hee knew well that God at other times had threatned things, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse upon the repentance, and prayers, and teares, upon the humiliation, and contrition of the hearts of his servants, he hath beene pleased to alter the sentence, to suspend, nay (it may be) wholly to take away and change the Execution. Thus it hath beene; It was so in the case of <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> The Lord sentas expresse <note place="margin">Isa. 38.</note> a message by <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> as he did by <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David: Set thy house in order, for thou shalt die and not live.</hi> Yet neverthelesse <hi>Hezekiah turneth his face to the wall,</hi> hee wept, and laid open his request before the Lord: <hi>Remember now, oh Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee, how I have walked before thee, in truth, and with a perfect heart,</hi> &amp;c. Yee see, the Lord presently sendeth the Prophet to tell him, that he had <hi>added fifteene yeares to his life:</hi> and yet the message
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14764:61"/>
was carried in expresse words, and in as peremptory termes, as a man would have thought it had beene absolute, and no condition intended.</p>
                  <p>The like in the case of <hi>Niniveh. Ionah</hi> commeth to <hi>Niniveh,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jonah 3. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>and began to enter the City, a dayes journey, and hee cried,</hi> and said, <hi>Yet fortie dayes, and Nineveh shall be destroyed.</hi> Here was the time limited, the Judgement declared, and no condition exprest: yet the King of <hi>Nineveh humbleth himselfe, and the people, they fast and pray, and goe in sackcloth,</hi> &amp;c. and the Lord was pleased to alter this sentence.</p>
                  <p>But some will say, these Examples were after <hi>Davids</hi> time, What were these to him? upon what ground did hee take this course? had he any promise or example before time of any such thing as this, that did give him incouragement to fast and pray, in hope that though God had said the child should die, yet it should live?</p>
                  <p>Certainly <hi>David</hi> had examples before time of the like nature, when God had threatned judgements, and they did not know, whether the issue would prove or no as they desired, yet they sought God. As in the case of <hi>Saul.</hi> When the Lord sent an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressemessage by <hi>Samuel,</hi> that the kingdome should be taken from <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.</note> him and given to another, because he had not dealt faithfully in the execution of Gods command concerning <hi>Amaleck,</hi> yet saith thetext, <hi>Samuel mourned for Saul still.</hi> Insomuch as the Lord que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioneth <note place="margin">Verse 35.</note> him; <hi>How long wilt thou mourne for Saul, seeing I have reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Chapt. 16. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>him from raigning over Israel:</hi> Yet <hi>Samuel</hi> continued in seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God: as if hee should say, Who knoweth what the Lord will doe?</p>
                  <p>But more expresly <hi>David</hi> had examples before his time, not onely of seeking the Lord, but of a gracious successe, and answer that those had that sought him. As in the case of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when there was a discontent amongst the people, because of the ill report that the Spies put upon the good land, the people began now to murmur against God: <hi>Well</hi> (saith the Lord to <hi>Moses,) let</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>me alone, and I will destroy this people at once. Moses</hi> setteth himselfe to seeke the Lord, and prayeth, and presseth the Lord with many arguments, for his owne glory, for his peoples sake, for his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants sake, and many other wayes to spare them. What was the issue of it? He was heard, the Lord told him that hee had heard his prayer, and granted his request, <hi>though hee would fill the earth with his glory,</hi> and all the world should know what a jealous God he was, another way: yet in this particular hee had granted his request, they should not be cut off at this time.</p>
                  <p>So that <hi>David</hi> had good experience, that though judgement hath beene threatned before, yet neverthelesse courses have beene
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14764:61"/>
taken that the sentence hath beene altered, without a change of Gods purpose at all. For God ever intended it to be understood with a condition, if they returned not to him he would goe on, if they returned to him, he would not goe on. So the purpose of God remaineth unchangeable, yet the sentence according to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall expression seemeth altered to us: so the change is in us, and not in God.</p>
                  <p>Hence let us note something (briefly) for our selves, and that <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. For instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> is this; First, how to understand all those threatnings in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that seeme peremptory and absolute, by this rule. A judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is threatned, against a nation, against a person, or family, &amp;c. Yea, and it is absolutely threatned in divers places; because thou hast done such and such evils, therefore such and such things shall come upon thee. All such as these, are to be understood conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, though they seem to be expressed absolutely. And the rule, God himselfe giveth. <hi>At what instant I shall speake concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdome, to plucke up, and to pull downe, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 18. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>to destroy it. If that nation against whom I have pronounced, turne from their evill, I will repent of the evill that I thought to doe unto them.</hi> Whatsoever I threatned in my Word, if they turne to me by true repentance, I will turne all that evill from them, that I have threatned against them, and would certainly have brought upon them, if they have not returned.</p>
                  <p>I say, thus we are to understand all these: and upon this ground <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. For incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</note> we may build some further uses, that I will but touch. First, to take off those discouragements that lie upon the hearts of many; When they find themselves guiltie of a sin against God, when they see, that, sinne threatned with severe punishment, and judgement in the word of God: now they conclude their case to be desperate, it is in vaine to seeke further, to use the meanes, the Lord will proceed in judgement, and there is no stopping of him. This is an addition to a mans other sinnes to conclude thus. Marke how the Lord expresseth himselfe in the 33. <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> The people were much troubled about such things there, say they; <hi>Our transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 10. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>and our sinnes bee upon us, and wee pine away in them, how should wee then live?</hi> The Prophet had incouraged them notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their great sinnes to returne by true repentance, and they should not perish; neverthelesse they are muttering, discouraged with feare, breaking their spirits, withdrawing themselves from God: the judgements of God are begun upon us, the hand of wrath is gone out against us, <hi>wee are pining away in them,</hi> though we are not wasted yet, yet we are like a man in a consumption, that wasteth by degrees, how shall we live? certainly wee shall die. Saith the Lord, say not thus among your selves, but know if yee turne, yee shall live; <hi>As I live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14764:62"/>
the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turne from his way and live: turne yee, turne yee from your evill wayes, for why will yee die, oh house of Israel?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beware of discouragements therefore, it is Sathans devise, that when once he hath drawne men from God by a path of sinne to hold them under discouragements, that so hee may ever after keepe them from turning to God againe. It was his devise where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he would have kept <hi>Adam</hi> from turning to God, after he had committed that great sinne in eating of the forbidden tree; Hee thought of nothing but hiding himselfe from God, and so he did hide himselfe amongst the bushes of the Garden: <hi>I heard thy voyce,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>and was afraid, and I hid my selfe:</hi> Marke, here was a feare of discouragement in <hi>Adam,</hi> that whereas he should have come and fell downe before the Lord, and have begged mercy, and said as <hi>David</hi> here, <hi>Who knoweth whether the Lord will bee gracious to mee?</hi> He ranne cleane away from God. There is a feare of reverence that keepeth a man with God, and there is a feare, that draweth a man to God: but this feare of discouragement driveth a man from God: and that is the temptation of Sathan, to keepe a man from God, when once he hath turned aside from him. Therefore (that is the first thing) take heed of such inward discouragements as may drive you quite off.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; Take incouragement then to seeke the face of God in his owne meanes and way. He hath threatned judgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst others for the same sinnes that yee find your selves guiltie of, when they have returned to him, they have found mercie. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne yee to him in truth, and seeke his face aright, and yee shall find the same mercie. In the prophesie of <hi>Ioel,</hi> yee shall see there, <note place="margin">Joel 2. 12, 13.</note> that though God had threatned judgements; nay, though he had begun judgement (for that was the case of those times, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was begun upon them) yet neverthelesse the Prophet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them to fasting and weeping, and telleth them, <hi>that the Lord is gracious and mercifull, and ready to forgive; and who knoweth if he will returne, and repent, and leave ablessing behind him?</hi> Therefore let us doe our parts, and seeke God in truth, amend our lives, and then no question of this, but that God will returne.</p>
                  <p>It is an old device of Sathan, to draw men, in stead of Gods revealed will, to looke to Gods secret will: whether I be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely rejected or cast off or not. But this is not the thought wherein a Christian should exercise himselfe: his maine businesse is this, to make his calling and election sure, by all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>vidences of it; by a holy life: walke obediently to Gods revealed will, and be certaine thou shalt not be rejected by Gods secret will. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rejecteth those by his secret will, and purpose, and decree, to whom he giveth a heart to walke obediently to his revealed will. So much for that.

                        <p>Who knoweth that the Lord will be gracious to me, that the child may live?</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The incouragement is this: <hi>That the child may live.</hi> But marke his expression; <hi>Whether the Lord will bee gracious to [me] that the child may live.</hi> If he had said no more but this, <hi>Who knoweth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the childe may live?</hi> A man would have thought this would fully enough have expressed his mind, but there is more in it that could not be expressed without this addition, <hi>Who knoweth whether the Lord will bee gracious to me, that the child may live?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The life of a child is a mercy to the father. <hi>David</hi> expresseth herein both his Pitty, and his Pietie.</p>
                  <p>His Pittie; He accounteth all the good or ill that befalleth his childe, as his owne: if death befalleth it, he accounteth it as a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie <note place="margin">Observe first <hi>Davids</hi> pitty.</note> that befalleth himselfe: if sicknesse befalleth his child, hee accounteth it as an affliction upon himselfe. This is his naturall pittie, that same naturall affection of a Father to his Child. See such an expression of the woman of <hi>Canaan; Have mercie on mee, thou sonne of David, my daughter is miserably vexed of a divell.</hi> The <note place="margin">Matt. 15. 22.</note> Daughter was miserably vexed, and the mother cryeth out, <hi>Have mercie on me.</hi> There is such a simpathy ariseth hence from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and free course that love hath in descending from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Child. There are not only morall perswasions that may invite and draw on love, but besides that, there is a course of affection, that floweth naturally, and kindly, from the Father to the child: as it is with those rivers that fall downward, they fall more vehemently then those that are carried upward: so the more naturall the affection is, the more vehement it expresseth it selfe in the motion to such objects. Now when the Father ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth his affection to his child, this is more vehement, because it is more naturall, there is more strength of nature in it.</p>
                  <p>I cannot stand upon this, only a word by way of inference, and application to our selves.</p>
                  <p>First; are naturall parents thus to their children? Then here is a ground of faith for the children of God, that he is pleased to <note place="margin">Comfort to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> stile himselfe by the name of Father, and to receive them into the adoption of sonnes and daughters. This was <hi>Davids</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of God, <hi>As a father hath compassion of his children, so hath the Lord on those that feare him.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> expresseth <note place="margin">Psal. 103:</note> it fully: <hi>In all their affliction, hee was afflicted, and the Angel of his presence saved them; in his love and pittie hee redeemed them, and bee</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 63. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>bare them all the dayes of old, hee bore them upon his wings.</hi> This gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth confidence, and boldnesse to Gods children, in making their requests knowne to him. This was it that incouraged the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14764:63"/>
                     <hi>I will arise and goe to my father, and say, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>God</hi> (saith S. <hi>Bernard) alwayes grants those petitions that are sweetned with the name of father, and the affection of a child.</hi> I should hence speake somewhat to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to stirre them up to answer the love of their Parents; but other things that follow forbids me any long discourse of this.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here is <hi>Davids</hi> pietie expressed in this, <hi>Who knoweth whether the Lord will bee gracious to mee?</hi> Hee exprest not only the <note place="margin">2 Observe <hi>Davids</hi> piety.</note> Pittie and affection of a naturall father to a child, but pietie also, arising from the sense of his guilt. Hee was guiltie of sinne, and by sinne he had brought this sorrow upon himselfe, and therefore <hi>who knoweth whether the Lord will bee gracious to me,</hi> in sealing to me the pardon of my sinne this way, in adding this mercy as a further assurance of his love, in granting me the forgivenesse of my sinne. God had told him by <hi>Nathan,</hi> that his sinne was pardoned, though he told him the Child should die: it may be by the same mercy he will release me from this sentence of death upon my Child, whereby he released me from the guilt of my sinne before. Here (I say) is the sense of his owne sinne.</p>
                  <p>The point I note hence is; <hi>That Parents in the miseries that befall</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Parents in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries should remember their owne sins. 1 King. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>their children, should call their owne sinne to remembrance.</hi> All the sorrowes, and sicknesses, and paines, and miseries that befall children, should present to Parents the remembrance of their owne sinne. It was the expression of the Widow of <hi>Sarepta</hi> to the Prophet <hi>Eliah; Art thou come to call my sinnes to remembrance, and to slay my childe?</hi> Shee saw her sinne in the death of her Child; So I say in all the afflictions and crosses that befall children, the Parents should call to remembrance their owne sinne.</p>
                  <p>But some men will here say; There seemeth to be no need of such a course, for God hath said plainly, <hi>That the child shall not die</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Object. 1. <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>for the sinne of the Parent.</hi> And after God cleareth his owne waies from inequalitie and injustice by that argument, <hi>The sonne shall not</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>beare the iniquitie of the father.</hi> Therefore what reason is there that Parents should call their sinnes to remembrance, in the miseries that befall their children?</p>
                  <p>I answer; Though he say, <hi>the child shall not die</hi> for the Parents <note place="margin">Answ.</note> sinne, yet we must understand it a right, for what doth hee meane by the sinnes of the Parent? And what doth hee meane by death?</p>
                  <p>By sinnes of the Parent, he meaneth those sinnes that are so the parents, as that the children are not at all guiltie of those sins: then the children shall not die.</p>
                  <p>By Death, he meaneth (as the word signifieth) the destruction of nature. So death shall not befall the child for that sinne that himselfe is not guiltie of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:14764:63"/>
But how then come little children to die before they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <note place="margin">Obiect. 2.</note> any sinne actually? was this for their owne sinne, or for the sinne of their Parents?</p>
                  <p>I answer, for their owne sinne they die, <hi>for the soule that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                     <hi>it shall die,</hi> and all children have sinned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they brought sinne into the world, <hi>and sinne brought death</hi> (as the Apostle speakes) <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>therefore death reigneth over all, even over those that have not sinned according to the similitude of Adams transgression;</hi> that is, that have not sinned actually as <hi>Adam</hi> had done, yet neverthelesse they die, because they have sinne upon them, they have the corruption of nature: <hi>In sinne they were borne, and in iniquitie their mother conceived them, and the wages of sinne is death:</hi> therefore they die for their owne sinne.</p>
                  <p>But what if temporall judgements and afflictions befall them, <note place="margin">Quest.</note> is this for their owne sinne, or for the sinne of their Parents?</p>
                  <p>I answer for both; both for their owne, and for the sinne of <note place="margin">Answ.</note> their Parents: for as death, so all the miseries of this life are fruits of originall sinne, which is an inheritance in the person of every child by nature, as soone as it is borne: but yet if the sinne of the Parents be added to it, that may bring temporall judgements. There are many instances and examples of this, how God hath visited upon the posteritie of wicked persons, the sinnes of their Fathers, according to that threatning in the second Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this you shall see, either in godly children of wicked parents, or in ungodly children of godly Parents. Suppose a man leave a great deale of wealth to his children, and have one that feares God amongst them: it may please God to lay some losse or crosse upon him, to the undoing of him, he may utterly be impoverished, and beggered, and deprived of all that meanes that his father left him by unrighteousnesse; <hi>Hee getteth an heire, and in his hand is nothing</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon)</hi> that is, God deprived him of all that estate his father left him by unrighteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>Now I say, here is a judgement upon the father, and yet a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon the child. A judgement upon the father, that all that he hath laboured for, that which hee lost his soule for, should bee vaine, should come to nothing, and not benefit his posteritie as he thought. Yet it is a mercy to the childe, to the child of God; He by this meanes is humbled, it draweth him from the world. Nay, when God emptieth him of these things that were unrighteously gotten, he giveth him (it may be) an estate another way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he shall see God his Father provide for him without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct and unlawfull courses.</p>
                  <p>So sometimes the very shame and reproach that falleth upon wicked children here, it is a judgement to the parents, and to the children too. Vpon the Parent, as farre as hee is guiltie of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14764:64"/>
neglect of his dutie, and of evill example, and the like, so hee is punished in the shame that befalleth his posterity. As it is a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon a man <hi>that hee is not ashamed to sit in the Gates</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 31.</note> speakes) no man can upbraid him with his children; So it is a correction to Gods children, even when their children prove ungodly, so farre as they have beene negligent, and carelesse of their duty. This was the case of old <hi>Eli,</hi> a good man, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse the hand of God was gone out against his house and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, and what was the reason of it? <hi>Because thou honourest thy</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam 2. 29. chap. 3. 12. 13</note> 
                     <hi>sonnes above mee, they made themselves vile, and thou restrainest them not, therefore will I bring a judgement upon thy house, at which both the cares of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</hi> I say it may come to passe (and that by reason of that naturall affection that is in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents) that that miserie that befalleth their children, may bee an exceeding crosse and affliction to them. God layes sharpe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections on them, when he makes those children which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as comforts, and the hope of their life, to bee the very crosse, and vexation of their life.</p>
                  <p>There is then yee see, such a course of Gods dealing with men, to visit the sinnes of the Fathers upon the children: that is, if the children walke in their fathers steps, if the child and the father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in a course of sinne: if the father by omission or commission make himselfe guiltie of the sinne of the child, &amp;c. and so if the child, either by imitation, or allowance goe on in his fathers way, he draweth a greater judgement upon himselfe, by adding to his fathers sinne: and as they are alike in sinne, so they shall be alike in judgement.</p>
                  <p>You see likewise for temporall judgements, that God may, and often-times doth lay many sicknesses, and crosses upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for the sinne of their parents, that they may bee smitten by the judgement that is upon their children, and yet neverthelesse the children may be free from sinne, <hi>for who ever was afflicted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing innocent?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is this so? then in the first place it should teach Parents to take heede of making themselves miserable in their posteritie by sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. To Parents.</note> against God.</p>
                  <p>There are specially three sorts of sinnes in Scripture, for <note place="margin">The sinnes that bring judgements upon mens posterity.</note> which God continueth his judgements upon mens posterities and families.</p>
                  <p>The first are, sinnes against the first Table, against the worship of God, Idolatrie, and such like; for these God smiteth mens <note place="margin">1</note> posterities, as wee may see in <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and others; And so the neglect of dutie, prophanenesse, and negligence in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: <hi>Let thy wrath come upon the heathen, and on the families that call not upon thy name.</hi> A familie I know, in a large sense, signifieth a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14764:64"/>
Nation, but in a strict sense; a familie, or posterity; in that place it signifieth both. A Familie or people, that lay aside the worship of God, and the sanctifying of his Name, those that lie under this charge of not <hi>calling upon the name of God: let thy wrath come upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A second sort of sinnes, are those against the second Table, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse, <note place="margin">2</note> injustice, uncleannesse, and the like: for those sins God visiteth mens posterities, punisheth them in their children: sometime by taking them away, sometimes by smiting them with such sicknesses, and temporall afflictions, and chastisements, as Parents have continuall matter of sorrow, and humiliation, and calling their sins to mind; The Scripture is full of instances of this kinde.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for the neglect of dutie to their children, when Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents <note place="margin">3</note> are too fond and remisse in their education, and carelesse in their dutie: therefore <hi>Iob</hi> was fearefull of this, lest his sons should sinne against God, and he was continually in prayer, that God would keepe them in his feare, Parents, if they would have a blessing continued on their posteritie, they should be carefull of sanctifying their Families, by the worship of God, and by their <hi>walking with an upright heart in the middest of their house,</hi> by dealing righteously with men in all their businesses, not to strive to reare their posteritie by wealth, but by grace, to leave them heires of the blessing, rather then of much money. That is the way to have comfort in children and posterity.</p>
                  <p>Yee see how few of those that in this Citie, or other places that have got such wealth, thrive in many generations, nay, it may be not in the next generation, but come some to notorious beggarie in the sight of others, that others may be warned how they get estates by unjustice and unrighteousnesse, to leave to their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. There is the judgement of God going along with unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gaine, and a sinfull life, and falleth upon posteritie, as farre as they approve of, or walke in their fathers waies.</p>
                  <p>In the second place it should teach children to take heed of the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. To children.</note> sinfull courses of their Parents, if they will not joyne with them in their punishment; nay, if they will not have the increase of their punishments, take heed, I say take heed of going on in their sinnes. Remember the charge that the Lord gave concerning <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon, Come out of her if you will not partake of her Plagues:</hi> if yee will not partake of their plagues, take heed of partaking in the sinnes of your Parents.</p>
                  <p>Here was <hi>Davids</hi> pietie, he calleth his sinnes to remembrance. So ought Parents in all crosses that befall their families or posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if any child be sicke or weake, or if there be any crosse in their estates, or trade, or successe in their businesse, whereby they
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14764:65"/>
should maintaine their Families, to call their owne sinnes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, to looke over the severall commands of God, to see what sinnes they are guiltie of, that they have not yet repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of.</p>
                  <p>Now wee come to <hi>Davids</hi> carriage, when the childe was <note place="margin">2. <hi>Davids</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage when his child was dead.</note> dead. <hi>But now hee is dead, wherefore should I fast: Can I bring him backe againe? I shall goe to him, but hee shall not returne to mee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here yee have <hi>Davids</hi> carriage, and the reasons why he did not <note place="margin">The reasons of it. 1</note> fast. First, because it was against reason, <hi>wherefore should I fast?</hi> in this expression, he implieth that he saw no reason for it, and that made him forbeare it. Secondly, it is altogether bootlesse <note place="margin">2</note> and needlesse; <hi>Can I bring him backe againe?</hi> Thirdly, <hi>I shall goe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3</note> 
                     <hi>to him:</hi> I have somewhat else to doe, then to spend my time in unprofitable sorrow, there is a matter that concerneth mee more neerely to thinke upon, that is, concerning my owne death, to prepare for that. And lastly, the last reason is, <hi>Hee shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to mee.</hi> These are the reasons of the alteration of his <note place="margin">4</note> carriage upon the death of the child.</p>
                  <p>Concerning sorrow for the dead, ye must understand it of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive sorrow. Here is not forbidden a due measure of sorrow, that is allowed; but he speakes of sorrow in the excesse. Why should I doe this?</p>
                  <p>The reasons he giveth against excessive sorrow, are first (I can but give you the heads of things) because it is a thing against rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. <note place="margin">Observation from the first reason.</note> Hence I will note this to you;</p>
                  <p>That one way to moderate our sorrowes, and to regulate them aright, is to bring them to the examination of reason and judgement.</p>
                  <p>When passions sway, when they doe not looke to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of reason, to bee subject and ordered according to that, but usurpe a rule in the soule above reason, then there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but confusion, and distemper, and disorder in a mans af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and actions, and in his whole course. A man should therefore consider, what reason there is for every thing. If hee sorrow for a thing, what reason have I for it? If hee rejoyce in any thing, what reason have I for it? Is it worth this sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or this joy? I say this is the way to rectifie and moderate our passions, and to order them aright, if wee trie them all by sound reason.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> tooke this course at other times, <hi>Why art thou cast downe, oh my soule, why art thou disquieted within mee?</hi> Is there any good <note place="margin">Psal. 44.</note> reason for it? Reason I say, is a curbe and bridle, to stop passion when it is running on in its free course.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:14764:65"/>
If <hi>David</hi> had done thus, would hee have runne out to that excessive expression for his sonne? <hi>Oh Absalom, my sonne, my sonne,</hi> &amp;c. What great reason had hee for this? that <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> a rebellious son was tooke away that sought the death of his father; that God glorified himselfe in the punishment of a diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, proud, insolent childe in the sight of all the world? Was this a matter for <hi>David</hi> so much to grieve, and to be troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at?</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Ionah</hi> had done thus, if hee had considered what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hee had to bee angrie; (as GOD putteth the question to him; <hi>dost thou well to bee angrie?)</hi> Would he not have stopped that Passion?</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Cain</hi> had done thus; if he had put the question to himselfe as GOD did, <hi>Why art thou wroth? why is thy countenance fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len?</hi> Or as that great King said to <hi>Nehemiah; Why is thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance sad?</hi> So if men would put the question to themselves concerning their affections: as, concerning love, why doe I set my heart upon such and such things? and so likewise concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their sorrow and anger, and every thing, Why is it thus? As <hi>Rebecca</hi> said when the children did striue in her womb, so when there is a conflict of passions in the soule against reason, since it is so, <hi>why am I thus? Who art thou that fearest mortall man?</hi> saith <hi>Isaiah</hi> to the Church. If men I say did thus, they would not breake out into such exorbitancie of passions, as commonly they doe.</p>
                  <p>The way then to order any affection aright, is to reduce <note place="margin">The way to order our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections is to reduce them to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied reason.</note> it to the principles of sanctified, and rectified reason and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let reason be guided by the Word of GOD, and let the affections be ordered by that reason so rectified. Thus it was with man in the state of innocencie; and experience telleth us, that in the state of corruption, all disorder commeth from the want of this subordination of the affections, to reason in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall actions and motions. When a man goes hood-winkd up and downe, hee is in danger of stumbling, and falling into one hole or other: this is for a man to <hi>walke in darknesse:</hi> then a man walketh in darknesse, when hee is not guided in all his actions and affections, by the light of truth shining in his understanding. A man should therefore strive to checke himselfe, and to suffer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to checke him, Why is it thus? If a man cannot give a cause and a reason, it is a passion to be rejected, a distemper to be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of. This is the first thing; He saw no reason, therefore hee would not doe it.</p>
                  <p>The second is this. It was altogether bootlesse, <hi>Why should I fast? I cannot bring him backe againe.</hi> Hee meaneth, bring him backe againe to live on the earth. So <hi>Iob</hi> meaneth, when hee speakes
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14764:66"/>
in the same manner, <hi>If a man die, shall hee live againe?</hi> hee cannot <note place="margin">Job 14, 14.</note> be brought backe againe to live, and converse among men.</p>
                  <p>The point I not hence is this.</p>
                  <p>That all the actions, and opportunities of this life cease <note place="margin">Observation from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reason.</note> in death.</p>
                  <p>There is no calling of them backe againe. No bringing of a man backe to take new opportunities, to enjoy the comforts he hath lost, and to make use of the meanes he hath neglected, and to redeeme the time he hath slackly let passe. When the request was put to <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Dives,</hi> that some might <hi>come from the dead</hi> to tell his brethren upon earth where he was: No, saith he, that request shall never be granted, that a man should come from the dead, to give warning to the living, much lesse that a man himselfe should returne from thence, to begin upon a new score, a new rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, to have a new time appointed, when that time is past over: <hi>They have Moses, and the Prophets, let them heare them.</hi> God hath appointed the meanes, and a time to use the meanes; <hi>Now they have Moses and the Prophets;</hi> After this life, they shall have none of those meanes, no time of using them; <hi>The child shall not come back againe,</hi> nor the man shall not come backe againe. Death is a strict doore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, all that passe out that way, the doore is shut on them, they shall never returne backe. Wee reade of many severall Ages that have gone to the place of silence, we never read of any that came thence, to tell what is done there: we never heard of any yet, that came backe againe to reforme his course. A friend with all his prayers and teares, cannot bring backe a friend that is dead.</p>
                  <p>It teacheth us a point of wisedome to make good use of our <note place="margin">Vse.</note> time, the time of grace we have. We draw neerer death eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day then other, and when once we are dead, we shall never be brought backe againe upon the earth; If a man had all the world, and would give it to obtaine an houres time upon earth, to doe what he neglected before, he cannot have it: therefore <hi>while it is called to day harden not your hearts: yet a little while and you shall have the light</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>while yee have the light, walke in the light;</hi> Make use of the meanes of grace: the time may come, when yee may wish (as <hi>Dives</hi> is described to wish) that some body, much more that you your selves might come from the dead.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, if those in Hell were to come from the dead againe, though it were to live a hundred yeares on earth a holy, strict, and conscionable life, to watch over all their wayes, to keepe a good conscience toward God and men, they would not omit a duty, nor slight a duty, they would not omit an opportunity, a minute, but spend their whole life in <hi>working out their salvations with feare
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14764:66"/>
and trembling,</hi> they would sleepe and awake with feare, lest they should sinne, they would be carefull that they had no sinfull thought, they would be patternes of the strangest expressions of conformitie to the rule that can be imagined, if it were possible to be granted. You may easily be perswaded of this, doe you that now which they wish for, and wish in vaine: make use of the time of grace now, there is no comming backe againe afterward.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. A third reason is this; <hi>I shall goe to him.</hi> As if hee should have have said, I have another businesse in hand, now the child is dead, it is not for me to stand blubbering, and spending my time for a dead Child; I am going to him. The word here is, <hi>I shall returne to him.</hi> Returne signifieth, to goe backe to a place where one was before; So <hi>David</hi> shall returne to his Child: for he was there before; there, in respect of his body, the principles of that is in the earth where the Child is, and in heaven in respect of his soule where the Child is: <hi>The Body returneth to dust</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>whence it was taken, and the soule to God that gave it.</hi> The body is of the dust, and returneth to dust, the soule commeth from God, and returnes to God againe. Therefore he saith here, I shall returne to him, because I came from him. When things are reduced to their first principles, the body to the earth, and the soule to God, they are said to returne. Yee see the phrase then.</p>
                  <p>The point (briefly) is this;</p>
                  <p>That the greatest care of a mans life, the greatest businesse he hath to doe <note place="margin">Observation from the third reason,</note> on earth, is to prepare for death.</p>
                  <p>His businesse is not to care for his children that are dead, and to spend unprofitable sorrow for them: the maine businesse of my life is, how I shall make my peace with God, and bee fitted for death, for I am going thither. Wee should observe the death of others, to stirre us up to a serious preparation for our owne death: the Father should be stirred up by seeing his Child dead before him, the elder by seeing the younger die before them: we see how death hath shot his arrowes beyond, and short, and above, and below us, in those that are elder, and younger, and richer and poorer, all sorts, he will strike us at last: this thing (I say) should stirre us up to prepare for our owne dissolution.</p>
                  <p>A man would thinke that there were no need of such a thing; the very bare sight of Corse, or a hearse, the bare fight of a dead corpse, the bare ringing of a bell, or a <hi>Funerall Sermon,</hi> should be warning enough to the living to tell him of death. When a man sees a company carrying a dead body to the gaave; he should say to himselfe; <hi>It may bee the feet of these may carrie me next.</hi> But how commeth it to passe that it is not thus?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:14764:67"/>
Certainly, there is not power in all examples to worke this: it is the worke of Gods spirit. Though a man observe the death of never so many before him, yet this cannot worke in him a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous care, to make preparation for his owne death, except God adde a further worke to it. We may see this in the expression of <hi>Moses,</hi> when so many died in the Wildernesse: <hi>Lord teach us to number our dayes, that wee may apply our hearts to wisedome.</hi> As if hee should have said, Though so many thousands died in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and that by so many severall kinds of death, yet we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver apply our hearts to wisedome by those examples, except God teach us that wisdome. Therefore we should pray to God to teach us by his Spirit, to make use of Examples. Men must give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for examples aswell as for rules; men must give account for examples of mortalitie, as well as for Sermons of mortalitie: therefore let the example of others mortality stirre you up to prepare for your owne, and that you may doe so, be much in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon God.</p>
                  <p>Lastly; <hi>Hee shall not returne to mee:</hi> that is in this sense, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse on earth, as he had done before; <hi>I shall returne to him, but hee</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Observation from the fourth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> 
                     <hi>shall not returne to mee.</hi> He doth but reitterate, and repeat what he had said before in effect.</p>
                  <p>This is the thing then that Parents must make account of, both for themselves and their children.</p>
                  <p>For their children. It should make them moderate therefore in their sorrow for them. God now hath shewed his purpose, and declared his will, therefore wee should rest in that will of God. This is the thing that <hi>David</hi> aymed at. Gods will was not only to takeaway his child, but so to take him away, as never to returne to him againe in that manner; Now God had declared his will, and therefore <hi>why should I fast</hi> (saith he) as if he should say, I will now rest in the will of God.</p>
                  <p>In all the things which we account crosses, and losses, in children and friends, &amp;c. The maine businesse of a Christian, is not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse sorrow, but submission and subjection to God, to exercise and inure his heart to patience, and to rest in Gods good pleasure and will. As <hi>Eli,</hi> though he faild in his carriage to his sonnes, yet he shewed a dutifull respect to God his heavenly father. When <hi>Samuel</hi> told him the judgement of God that should come upon his house, <hi>It is the Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>let him doe what seemeth him good in his owne eyes:</hi> though it were a heavy judgement, such as <hi>whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever should heare of it, both his eares should tingle, yet it is the Lord, let him doe what seemeth him good.</hi> As if he should say; I have nothing to doe in this businesse, but to subject my selfe with patient sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and contentednesse to his will, it is the Lord, it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not me to contend with him, and to reason with God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14764:67"/>
his worke, I confesse <hi>hee is righteous, let him doe what seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him good in his owne eyes.</hi> And so <hi>Aaron.</hi> There was a heavy judgement befallen him, his sonnes were consumed with fire; yet, the text saith, <hi>Aaron held his peace.</hi> When God manifested so great wrath to his house, in wasting, and consuming, and burning his sonnes, for offering of strange fire, yet <hi>Aaron held his peace;</hi> that is, he did only mind how to glorifie God by a contented submission to his will. So <hi>Iob,</hi> hee heard not only of the losse of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but that he lost them in such a manner, by a violent death, by a house falling on their heads, <hi>yet the Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed bee the name of the Lord.</hi> Whereas a carnall worldly man would have fallen to strugling, and contending, and quarrelling against God, and so trouble and perplex his owne spirit. We doe exceedingly imbitter Gods cup, by mingling with it ingredients of our owne passions, and so make the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more heavy and grievous then God intends it. Here is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: <hi>wee possesse</hi> not <hi>our soules with patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we are sensible of the losse of friends and children, &amp;c. let us learne to make it our businesse, to thinke. I have a greater worke to doe, to prepare for my owne death. God in the death of this man speakes to me to prepare for my owne; And then to glorifie God by submission to his will, make it appeare that thou acknowledgest a power in God to dispose of thy house, to doe every thing, by patiently resting in his will.</p>
                  <p>And yet this comfort is added, though children be tooke away that they shall not returne in an earthly manner, yet they shall in a better manner. Parents are contented to part with their children for a time for their preferment. Children (though theyare ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry young) that are commended by the prayers of the godly Parents into the hands of God; these whose hearts God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and quickned fervently and faithfully to pray in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of their children, they may rest in this assured, that they shall meet at the Resurrection in a better manner, their children shall be better preferred then if they were on earth, and shall be raised up to perfection.</p>
                  <p>Here you see there is not a tooth bred in a child without a great deale of paine, and every tooth cost some paine, but this <hi>mortall bodie shall put on immortalitie, and this corruption shall put on incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> This weake body shall be made strong, weake children strong without paine. Death endeth these things, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection shall present him in a perfect measure of strength in a glorified estate. So much for this text, and for this time.</p>

not trouble you to thinke so of Death, the condition of it is not so strange and hard as men take it to be; <hi>It is swallowed up in victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> If a man have a strong enemy to deale with, it might trouble him, but it is no great matter to deale with a conquered enemie: Christ hath overcome Death, hath conquered that strong enemie, <hi>Death is swallowed up in victory.</hi> Therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, and subsequent verses of this Chapter, seemeth to insult and triumph over Death, <hi>Oh Death</hi> (saith he) <hi>where is thy sting, oh grave where is thy victorie?</hi> As if he should say, before Christ came and conquered thee, Death thou wert victorious; so it was, there was a sting in it: before Christ sweetned the Grave, there was something that was terrible in the Grave, but now because Christ is come, and hath gotten the victory over the one, and sweetned the other, therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> breakes forth thus into an insultation and triumph.</p>
                  <p>But, how can this be? Why doth the Apostle thus triumph?</p>
                  <p>The reason is insinuated in the verse I have read to you, <hi>the sting of death is sinne, and the strength of sinne is the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is the occasion of trouble to Christians?</p>
                  <p>No, it is not, <hi>thankes bee to God, that hath given us victory through Iesus Christ our Lord:</hi> As if he should say, I will shew you the reason, of my triumphing over Death, there was a sting in Sinne, and Sinne is the sting of Death, and the Law is the strength of sinne, but Christ hath tooke away sinne, and hath satisfied the Law, sinne being taken away, Death cannot hurt me, the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing satisfied, Sinne cannot prejudice me. This was the cause of the Apostles, and in him of every Christians insultation over Death.</p>
                  <p>The words I have read containe two parts;</p>
                  <p>First, the sting of Death. <note place="margin">Division.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the strength of Sinne.</p>
                  <p>First, the <hi>sting of death, is sinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>the strength of sinne, is the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If there were no law, there would bee no sinne, and if there were no sinne, there would be no death: <hi>Sinne is the transgression of the Law, and sinne is the sting of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall only at this time insist upon the first of these, from whence I shall deliver that, which if it please God to accompany with his Spirit, may be usefull to you.</p>
                  <p>The proposition. shall be the very words of the Text; <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Propos.</hi> Sin is the sting of death.</note>
                     <q>
                        <p>Sinne is the sting of death.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Proposition I would not have you understand in this sense only, that death came in by sinne meerely in a habit, though that be true too. But understand it in this sense, That all the horrour
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14764:70"/>
and terriblenesse of Death, all the power and rage it hath, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever makes it fearefull to a man, it receiveth it all from sinne. It is sinne that armeth Death against a man, if Death have any weapons against a man, Sinne puts those weapons into the hands of Death; if Death have any poyson against a Christian, the sinne of that person putteth that poyson in it.</p>
                  <p>Death may bee considered two wayes, either as Christ hath <note place="margin">A double consideration of death.</note> made it, or as we make it.</p>
                  <p>Death as Christ hath made it, is a medicine to a Christian, a <note place="margin">1</note> passage and entrance to happinesse, it is a day of redemption and refreshing, and so we need not be afraid of it.</p>
                  <p>Death as we by sinne have made it, is the Pale horse Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2</note> speakes of in the Revelation, it is as a fearfull arrest to the debtor, it hath a sting in it: and so it is fearefull.</p>
                  <p>But that I may open this point more profitably, wee will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into these particulars.</p>
                  <p>First, what death the Apostle speakes of here.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, of what sinne he speakes of.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in what respect sinne is called the sting of death. And then we will make the use and application of all this.</p>
                  <p>First, of what death doth the Apostle here speake of, that sinne <note place="margin">What death is here meant.</note> is the sting of?</p>
                  <p>For answer hereunto, there is a double death, corporall and spirituall.</p>
                  <p>Corporall death, is the privation of the soule: when the soule is severed from the body.</p>
                  <p>Spirituall death, when God and grace are severed from the soule.</p>
                  <p>The Text speakes of the corporall death. Sinne is not the <note place="margin">Corporall death. Principally.</note> sting of the spirituall death, for the spirituall death is sinne it selfe. And here I will not contend with any man, if he be full of enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but I will distinguish two parts of spirituall death, and I grant in one of them is this sting.</p>
                  <p>In spirituall death therefore, there are two parts, or two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; <note place="margin">Two parts of spirituall death.</note> The first is called, the first death; That I take to bee the death of the soule in sinne.</p>
                  <p>The second part is, when soule and body are for ever closed up in Hell. And in this part, sinne is the sting; And remember this by the way, Sinne is not onely a sting now, but it will be a sting to men in Hell: the sting, the deadlinesse, the extremity of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is in Hell, it is received all from sinne: for the damned in Hell when they come there, as they cease not to sinne, so the sting of sinne ceaseth not to be with them: and it may be delivered by conjecture, I thinke Hell were no Hell, if there were not the sting of sinne there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:14764:71"/>
So then you see what death the Apostle speakes of: principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of corporall death, but it may be extended to the second part of spirituall death, for there sinne continueth, and so the sting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth.</p>
                  <p>The next question is, what sinne the Apostle speakes of, when he saith, <hi>the sting of death is sinne?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is not a time to stirre controversies, therefore those anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent controversies, and such as are lately stirred up about originall sinne, how farre it is the sting of death, I let them goe.</p>
                  <p>In a word, to let you see what sinne is the <hi>sting of death,</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this. Sinne may be considered two wayes, either as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, <note place="margin">What sinne is the sting of Death. Sinne two wayes consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> untouched, uncrushed. Let that sinne be what it will be, whether it be originall onely, or whether it be any actuall sinne, streaming from originall, whether it be a sinne of ignorance or knowledge, whether it be of pleasure or of profit; A sinne imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly that respecteth God, or immediatly respecteth our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, whatsoever the sinne be, if it bee not touched, if it bee not crushed, if it scape uncontrouled, if it be in its native power, and keepes in his kingdome, if it rule in a man; that sinne will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be the sting of Death. Euery sinne vertually is <hi>the sting of death,</hi> there is an aptitude in every Sinne. But in the event that Sinne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth <note place="margin">Sinne unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified proves the sting of death.</note> 
                     <hi>the sting of death,</hi> that is untouched, uncontrouled. Not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sinne in the event proveth the <hi>sting of death;</hi> but that Sinne that liveth in us, or rather that Sinne that we live in, that ruleth in us, that we affect, and love, this is the Sinne that putteth a <hi>sting into death.</hi> That very sinne that thou lovest, and likest so much, and pleadest for, that sinne will make death terrible.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; Sinne may be considered as it is galled, and vexed, and mortified in the Soule, When a man setteth upon the root of Sinne, and the way of Sinne, and falleth a crucifying the body of Sinne, and the members of it, I say, howsoever there bee divers motions and stirrings of Sinne in the soule; yet if these be disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed, disaffected, and mortified, if there be a crucifying vertue, passe over them, if they come not within the judgement to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, or within the affections to embrace and like them; if they come not to be a mans trade, and way, and walke, but fall within the improbation of the judgement to disavow them, and the misliking of the affections to sorrow for them: These shall not be the <hi>sting of death,</hi> whatsoever the motions are. But these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, unmortified sinnes, these are the <hi>sting of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now these are the <hi>sting of death,</hi> in a double respect; First, in respect of the guilt; Secondly, in respect of the corruption.</p>
                  <p>First, they are a <hi>sting</hi> in respect of guilt. Every Sinne remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">1. In respect of the guilt.</note> unsatisfied for, remaineth with his guilt, and when Sinne is not satisfied for, there is the <hi>sting of death.</hi> When the sinner hath
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14764:71"/>
nothing to oppose to the justice of God, for the sinne he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, if the Sinne be in the booke of God uncrossed, bee a debt there not blotted out by the blood of Christ; if Christ have not satisfied for it; if the sinner have not part in him (as we shall heare anone) then Sin is the <hi>sting of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then secondly, they are a sting in respect of the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">2. In respect of the filth.</note> and filthinesse of Sins unmortified. Those filthy sinfull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, those depraving qualities inthy soule that thou likest, and practisest in thy conversation, they give thee up into the hands of Death, to execute his Sting upon thee; And therefore you that applaud your selves in Sinne, and will goe on in Sin, doe so. But know this, when thou commest to the full strength of thy Sinne, let it be what it will, when Death commeth, it findeth the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est weapon it hath in thy sinne: the very power of thy sinne arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Death against thy soule. No man is more obnoxious, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the sharpest dart of Death, then that man that will goe on in Sinne.</p>
                  <p>So you see what Sin is spoken of, that is <hi>the sting of death,</hi> that Sin is the <hi>sting of Death,</hi> that a man loveth and doteth on.</p>
                  <p>The third Question is, in what respect <hi>Sin is the sting of Death?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">How sinne is said to be the sting of Death.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First by way of Eminencie, because that then the sting of Sin beginneth most sensibly to worke in a man. Not but that Sin hath a <hi>sting</hi> before Death, but then the deluded sinner feeles his sinne; there be divers times that Sin can sting a person before that, but then (howsoever the sinner hath deluded himselfe, and the word of God, and the world) he can delude them no more, Death then (most ordinarily) fixeth his <hi>sting</hi> in the soule, and makes the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner feele the smart of his sinne.</p>
                  <p>There be three times wherein Sinne can sting a man;</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Before death.</item>
                     <item>At death.</item>
                     <item>After death.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Before Death. God sometimes letteth loose the conscience of <note place="margin">Sin stings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death.</note> a man, even of the most resolved sinner, of him that beares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe up aloft in his owne eyes in scorne, and contempt of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie of the Word: sometime (I say) God singleth out such a person, and rippeth up all his heart, strikes his Arrowes into his very soule, and stings his conscience so irresistably, that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not which way to turne from the wrath that boyleth in his soule. And it is one thing to deale with the Minister, and another to deale with God; When God strikes his <hi>Arrowes</hi> of uengeance into the soule of a sinner, then such a one is stung indeed, this God doth sometimes before death.</p>
                  <p>Nay, sometimes God stingeth the consciences of his owne children for sinne. <hi>David</hi> cries out, hee roared for the disquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:14764:72"/>
of his spirit, his bones were broken, he was sore vexed, <hi>Lord how long?</hi> saith he. If there be such deepe disquiet, by reason of this sting in the consciences of good persons, tell me then, what is the disquiet that springeth from sinne, in a <hi>Cain,</hi> in a <hi>Iudas,</hi> when it meets with a dispairing disposition? Thus you see Sin hath this time to <hi>sting,</hi> and therefore thinke not that Sin will never <hi>sting</hi> till death, sometimes <hi>Sinne stingeth a man before death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another time is <hi>at death.</hi> When Death commeth and arresteth <note place="margin">At death.</note> a sinner in an Action from God, seizeth on a person that is under the power of Sin, on one that is in his sinnes untouched, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he behaved himselfe in his life-time, yet then the very name of Death breakes his heart, it apaleth him, and then it stings such a person. <hi>It is appointed</hi> (beloved) <hi>for all of us once to die;</hi> Death will one day arrest every man, but when Death appeareth before a man, that hath not a part in Christ, that is under the power of his sinnes, when it commeth to a <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> it makes his very <hi>joynts to smite one against another,</hi> it is a <hi>sting</hi> to him amidest all those <hi>sweet morsels,</hi> his sinnes, which he so much affected, and so earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pursued, it is as a very poyson to him; nothing is a poyson now to us but sinne only; but then at the time of death, sinne is a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son indeed.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Sinne can sting not onely before, and at, but after death. <note place="margin">After death.</note> Both at the day of Judgement, and after.</p>
                  <p>At the day of Judgement. Is not the conscience of a sinner <note place="margin">At the day of Judgement.</note> (thinke you) stinged, and his spirit deeply affected, by reason of the great wrath of God that is to be poured out, when he shall <hi>cry to the mountaines to cover him,</hi> when he shall call to those insensible creatures, that are not able to lend him that courtesie to crush him to nothing? Make this our owne case, thinke of it, it will be our case, as <hi>it is appointed for us all to die, so we must all come to judgtment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And after the Judgement, when the sentence, <hi>goe you cursed</hi> is <note place="margin">After the judgement.</note> past, the <hi>sting</hi> of Sin ceaseth not, no, the <hi>worme</hi> for ever gnaweth in Hell. It were a happinesse for a sinner, if he might onely heare the sentence, if this <hi>worme</hi> might not still gnaw his conscience, but then, this is his burthen, Sin shall <hi>sting</hi> him for ever.</p>
                  <p>This is the first respect in which sinne is called the <hi>sting of death,</hi> because then Sinne stingeth more emminently and sensibly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is called the <hi>sting of death,</hi> in respect of the meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor the Apostle aludeth unto, it is taken from the sting of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and so Sinne is a <hi>sting</hi> in a double respect; First in respect of the fearefulnesse, and then in respect of the hurtfulnesse of it.</p>
                  <p>First, in respect of the fearefulnesse; It is Sin that makes Death <note place="margin">Sinne makes death fearful.</note> fearefull to a man. Indeed I confesse, that in the best Christian (though Christ have pulled out the <hi>sting of death</hi> yet) there are naturall grudgings, and shruggings. As to a Serpent, though the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14764:72"/>
sting be pulled away, yet there are some abhorrings, and dissikes in a man. But then how terrible is Derth, when it commeth in compleate Armour, as it doth against a person in whom Sinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in its full power? it must needs then be terrible.</p>
                  <p>See the difference betweene two persons, the one is afraid of every one he meeteth, the other is not; what is the reason? the one is greatly indebted and ingaged, the other is free. So it is with a Christian, and another man, the one cannot heare of Death but his heart breakes, hee is full of feare and horrour; the other heareth of Death, and is onely somewhat affected in the hearing of it, but not possessed with that feare as is the other, what is the reason? the <hi>sting of death</hi> remaineth in one, and not in another. Sin therefore is a sting in that respect.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a sting in respect of hurtfulnesse. The sting of <note place="margin">Sinne makes death hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> the Serpent is a hurtfull thing, it poysoneth the vitall parts, it takes away life it selfe. All the evill that commeth to us by death, commeth by sinne. Man need not complaine of the ilnesse of the prison so much, as of his owne folly, that he ingaged himselfe in debt, whereby he is cast into prison. Why complainest thou of the misery in Hell? rather labour to <hi>breake off thy sinnes</hi> that are the cause of all that miserie: all the hurtfull qualitie, and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition that befalleth a person in Death and Hell, is for Sin: the eternall separation of the soule from God, and all punishment that followes after in Hell, are the fruit of mans sinne. Hell had not beene Hell without Snne: it is Sin that causeth it to become hurtfull.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have explained these inquiries.</p>
                  <p>Now I come to make Use and application, and so conclude the Point.</p>
                  <p>The first Use of this point shall be this; If <hi>Sin</hi> be <hi>the sting of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Vse.</note> 
                     <hi>death,</hi> let it be our wisedome to get this sting pulled out in the time of our life. <hi>Oh that this people were wise</hi> (saith God) <hi>then would they consider their latter end.</hi> If you were wise that heare mee this day, you would consider that Death will come, and (if it be not taken away before-hand) with a <hi>sting</hi> upon the soule.</p>
                  <p>My brethren, we have many enemies to deale with, even now at this very instant, but there is yet an enemie, as the Apostle saith, <hi>The last enemie to bee subdued is Deaeh,</hi> he his behind: and here is the difference betwixt Death our last enemie, and some other of our enemies: some other of our enemies cannot be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, but by their presence, but (let me tell you) this Death is such an enemy, as is never subdued, but by his absence, thou canst never overcome Death in death, thou must not reserve this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat till thou come to the field, but thou must overcome this enemie before he commeth, thou must overcome him in thy life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:14764:73"/>
How is that? Pull out the <hi>sting</hi> of him now, then Death is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. How will you disarme the tongues of malicious slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous persons, and deprive them of their viperous speech? by an innocent life. So, how will you take away the <hi>sting of death?</hi> watch against Sin, take away sinne, and you take away the power from Death, set upon Sin, and Death is overcome, so much sinne as is now dead, so much is Death conquered.</p>
                  <p>I beseech you seriously consider these particulars.</p>
                  <p>First, that it will not be long, ere Death knocke at these dores of ours, these houses of clay must shortly be ruinated, wee must certainly be resolved into dust. What is this life of ours, but as a ship that is driven by a gale of breath? When the breath of man ceaseth, the ship lieth in a dead calme. <hi>Man goeth to his long home</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 12.</note> (saith <hi>Solomon) and the mourners follow in the streets.</hi> Death is our <hi>long home,</hi> wee all are the <hi>mourners,</hi> wee <hi>follow in the streetes.</hi> This dead carcasse is an example that leads us to our home, and <hi>a sermon</hi> to tell us that we must follow: we follow now in a charitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, but we shall follow one day, in paying of the same debt. Looke overall the times of the world, and the dispositions of persons, looke over learning and folly, greatnesse or poorenesse, find me a man that escaped Death. Die we must; and we have need to have this much pressed upon us, for it is a hard matter to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that we must die, that I must be the man that must die: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notions of Death are granted, but that I must die, and lie in the dust, and stand before God, it is a hard matter to beleeve this.</p>
                  <p>And consider this secondly, that Death will be terrible to thee, if he knocke and find a <hi>sting</hi> in thee. Thou that now wilt not be reclaimed from swearing; Alas what will become of that blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming soule of thine, when Death shall come and find a <hi>sting</hi> of blasphemy in thee? How darest thou thinke of giving up that swearing soule of thine to the Judge of heaven and earth? Thou unrighteous person that wilt not sanctifie the Lords day, how da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest thou give up that unholy soule of thine to the holy God? Dost thou thinke to have an eternall rest in heaven, and wilt not give God a rest here? So I might say for all kind of sinners. Thinke of this, take heed lest Death find a <hi>sting</hi> in thee, for all the <hi>sting</hi> that Death hath, it findeth in thy selfe, looke to it, thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be fearfull, if Death come and find Sin unmortified, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented of in thee. <hi>God will</hi> certainly <hi>bring thee to judgement,</hi> for every thought, and word, and action.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly consider this, that naturally we are so tempered, that if Death come, he shall find his weapons, and strength in us, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man of us, I meane considered naturally. <note place="margin">How a man shall know whether Death shall come with a sting to him.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how shall I know whether Death when he commeth, shall find a sting in me or no?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:14764:73"/>
I will only give you two tryals, you shall know it thus. First, if thy conscience now <hi>sting</hi> thee for some approved sinne, if thou repent not, Death will assuredly meet thee with a <hi>sting;</hi> that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved sinne of thine will be the <hi>sting of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conscience will <hi>sting</hi> a man either for the act done, or for the approbation of the act, if conscience <hi>sting</hi> a man, for his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a sinfull qualitie, or for a sinfull course, if a man continue in that course, surely that will be the <hi>sting of death</hi> to his soule: therefore looke to thy selfe, perhaps thou art convicted of such a sinne, perhaps thy conscience hath so wrought on thee, that it hath stung thee for such a sinne, thou yet approvest thy selfe in it, and thou wilt goe on in thy pride still, in such and such sinnes stil, thou wilt doe so: doe: but know this, that stand thou never so much upon thy resolution, Death will certainly come, and if he find thee in such a sinne against thy conscience, thou hast reserved in thy selfe a <hi>sting</hi> for Death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a man shall know if Death come with a <hi>sting</hi> by this <note place="margin">Eccles. 11. 9.</note> tryall that <hi>Solomon</hi> giveth us in <hi>Eccles. 11. 9. Rejoyce, oh young man in thy youth, and let thy heart cheare thee in the dayes of thy youth, and walke in the wayes of thy heart, and sight of thine eyes, but know that for all these things God will bring thee to judgement.</hi> If thou live a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous life, Death will certainly come with a <hi>sting. Dives,</hi> hee lived a voluptuous life, had he not a <hi>sting</hi> for it? So others in Scripture, did not their plentifull tables, and voluptuous courses bring a <hi>sting</hi> on them? A voluptuous life makes a <hi>sting</hi> for Death. When a poore wretch is a dying, and shall begin to reflect backe on his life, what have I done? how have I lived? so much time I have spent, or mispent inapparell, in vanitie, in eating, in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in swaggering; What comfort is this to his soule? how can he answer this before God? this is the very thing that will <hi>sting</hi> him at such a day, when he can reade nothing in his life, but bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennesse, and unfruitfulnesse, nothing that hath honoured God in all his life. Certainly, my brethren, if there be an Epicurious, voluptuous life, this life will provide a <hi>sting</hi> for Death.</p>
                  <p>Alas you will say, Is it so, then we may feare that Death will seize on us thus, for we confesse, we have gone on in a voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life, gone on in sinne, that our conscience hath condemned us for, how shall we doe to pull out this <hi>sting?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would to God you were thus affected, that you were convicted, what a fearfull thing it will be, if sinne remaine. But wouldest thou have the <hi>sting of death</hi> pulled out before death come?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How shall I disarme it, that I may looke death in the face with comfort?</p>
                  <p>I shall give you some wayes and meanes, remember them, and <note place="margin">How to get the sting of Death pulled out.</note> practise them.</p>

First, get but a part in Christ, and <hi>the sting of death</hi> is gone: <note place="margin">1. Get a part in Christ. Rev. 1. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>thankes bee to God</hi> (saith the Apostle here) <hi>that hath given us victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> It is he that in the Revelation is said to <hi>have the keyes of Hell, and of Death:</hi> they are under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and subjection, he is victorious over them, hee hath van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished them, so that if a man have Christ, he hath victorie and power over Hell and Death. I told you in the beginning, that that which giveth a <hi>sting</hi> to Death, is the guilt of sinne: It is so, and it is a fearfull sting: Now that which takes away the guilt of sinne, is Christ. If Christ be mine, I have enovgh to answer the guilt of sinne. Therefore the Apostle saith, <hi>Death cannot separate</hi>

                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>from the love of God in Christ;</hi> What shall then? Indeed nothing, it is not the guilt of his sinnes, Christ hath satisfied from them. So that if thou wilt have the <hi>sting of death</hi> out, get faith in Christ: if thou be not hidden <hi>in the clefts of that Rock,</hi> in the bloud of Christ, if Christ be not thy Justification, and thy righteousnesse, what hast thou to answer the Justice of God? you must die, and stand before God, and how can you stand before God in your sinnes? you cannot without Christ, why doe you not then studie more for Christ? Why doe you not labour for faith in him? It will be your wisedome to labour earnestly to make sure of him, if you have him, the <hi>sting of death</hi> is gone. Death cannot hurt a person that hath Christ. Get faith in Christ therefore, that is the first.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if you would not have Death terrible, and fearfull <note place="margin">2. Get since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of heart.</note> to you: labour for sincerity. My brethren, it is a marvellous thing, and yet the truth, uprightnesse, and sincerity of heart, it is an ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling grace. All the particular things that we account particular, otherwise they have not an inabling vertue in them. Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have a great deale of learning and wit, and many friends, much riches, and the like; yet there commeth an occasion some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that puzzleth all these, there commeth an occasion some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, that a mans learning is of no use, and naturall parts and wit cannot helpe, and riches cannot inable him. What time is that? The time of death, the heart of a man is put to it at such a time, and now these shrinke, nothing can inable a man against feare so much, as sincerity and uprightnesse. When the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> told <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> from God, that he must die, he flieth to this, <hi>Lord remember</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>how I have walked before thee with an upright heart, and done that which was good in thy sight.</hi> When Death commeth to a wicked volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous person, and telleth him, I am here come for thee, thou must appeare before God, what can this man say? Lord I have lived before thee, a voluptuous, proud, wretched life, I was a scorner of thy Word, a contemner and persecutor of thy people, a swearer, &amp;c. What though perhaps he can say, Lord I have heard so many Sermons, I have beene so much in conference, and the like, will
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14764:74"/>
this inable a man against the feare of Death? No, nothing but this, that he hath a sincere heart, that his heart is unmixed, that sinne is not affected in his soule, that there is no sinne that hee would live in, no duty that he would not doe, <hi>Lord remember that I have walked before thee uprightly;</hi> I say, nothing will inable a man more against feare then sinceritie, and nothing disgraceth, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexeth the soule in an exigent more then hypocrisie. It is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie that takes away the sting of Death. The Apostle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. saith he; <hi>No man liveth to himselfe, but if hee live, hee liveth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>to the Lord; and if hee die, hee dieth to the Lord, whether wee live or die, wee are the Lords.</hi> Here is the comfort, wee are the Lords, saith he. How proveth hee that? <hi>Wee live unto him:</hi> That is the worke of a sincere heart; A true Christian liveth not to himselfe, but to Christ; Now, if thy conscience give thee this testimony, I have lived unto Christ, then whether <hi>I live or die, I am the Lords;</hi> the Apostle concludeth it. So right is that of <hi>Solomon, Riches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth not in the day of wrath, but righteousnesse delivereth from death.</hi> Thy righteousnesse and sincerity delivereth thee, not from dying, but from death; It takes away the <hi>sting</hi> and power of Death, Death shall not be death to thee, it is onely a passage to thee. Therefore remember as to get a part in Christ, so to get a perfect, and sincere heart, and then the <hi>sting of death</hi> is gone. But a hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall divided heart, a heart and a heart, that will sting a man. That is the second.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wouldest thou have the <hi>sting of death</hi> pulled out <note place="margin">3. Practise Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> now; Then mortifie thy sinnes now, doe it presently. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith (but I thinke hee speakes it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of afflictions) <hi>I professe by our rejoycing in Christ Iesus, I die</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>daily,</hi> If it be meant of afflictions, yet it should be verified of us in respect of sinne, <hi>die daily</hi> to sinne, and then the <hi>sting of death</hi> is gone. Oh beloved, our condition will be sad, and discomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when at once we must enter into the field with Death and Sinne; he that dieth daily to Sin, hee hath nothing to doe with Death when it commeth; Death may come to such a party, but it cannot hurt him, he may rest quietly when it commeth. And ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it, so much sinne as thou now sparest so much <hi>sting</hi> thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servest for Death, and is it not folly in a man to spare sinne that giveth a <hi>sting</hi> to Death?</p>
                  <p>But now, as a man is to crucifie every sinne, (let me put in this caution, and remember this advise) As the <hi>sting</hi> of every sin is to be pulled out, so pull out especially the sting of that Sin, that now stingeth thy conscience, that now lieth upon thy conscience; for if it worke now, it will worke fearfully at death: Death doth not lessen the work of sin, but inrageth it; God wil then present and <hi>set thy sins in orderbefore thee:</hi> perhaps God hath brought thee here to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:14764:75"/>
day to heare this Word; getthee home, and set thy soule in order. The love of Sin, and the feare of Death, seldome pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>t, and where Sinne is much loved, Death will there be much feared, Death is never more terrible, then where sin is most delighted in. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore crucifie sinne, if thou wilt have the <hi>sting of death</hi> taken away. It may be thou thinkest it is a troublesome worke: but remember, that those sinnes which thou now so much delightest in, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest, and livest in, will then prove the <hi>sting of death</hi> to thee. If a man would spend his time in the mortification of sinne, when death commeth, he should have nothing to doe, but to let his soule loose to God, and to give it up to him, as <hi>into the hands of his most faithfull Creatour and Redeemer.</hi> And is it not an excellent thing for a man to have nothing to doe with Death when it commeth?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, here is a use of comfort. If it hath pleased God to give any of us the grace to pull out the <hi>sting of death,</hi> it is a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Death is approching, you will say.</p>
                  <p>Oh, but Death is disarmed, the <hi>sting</hi> of it is taken away, what a singular comfort is it then to you that Death is comming? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all the comfort that the soule is capable of is this, that the <hi>sting of death</hi> is tooke away? Now when Death commeth upon such a man, it doth but free him from all that state of miserie hee is in here, from all that extremitie of condition that he is put into, from all those diversities of occasions, pressing occasions, of tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling about in the world, Death doth but put an end to all.</p>
                  <p>And (which is an excellent comfort to a Christian) Sin is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Death: what afflicteth the soule of a Christian, but that hee carrieth about him <hi>a body of sinne, and of death?</hi> This was a trouble to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and is to every true Christian: Now, when Death commeth, there is an end of this <hi>Body of sinne,</hi> thou shalt never sinne more, thou shalt never grieve the Spirit of God more, thou shalt never be clogged with such imperfections, and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in dutie: that death, that commeth to thee, shall passe thee, to the fruition of eternall glory, and what canst thou desire more, then to be happy in eternall glory with God?</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>A word or two of each of these parts.</p>
                  <p>First; <hi>Death is.</hi> Yee know that well enough, your eyes shew it <note place="margin">1. Death is.</note> you daily: our senses declare it so plainly, that no man is so sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse that knoweth it not: It is agreed upon by all. Only for your
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14764:77"/>
better furtherance to make use of this point, let us acquaint you with that which nature will teach yee concerning Death. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with that which Scripture will teach you, above, and better then Nature.</p>
                  <p>Nature sheweth yee concerning Death, first what it is. And then <note place="margin">Nature tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, what Properties it hath.</p>
                  <p>It telleth us this, That <hi>Death</hi> is an absence from life, a ceasing <note place="margin">1. What death is.</note> from beeing, when one was beeing, to be thrust (as it were) out of the present world, and be cast some where. This is all that Nature informeth us concerning the Essence and beeing of <hi>Death. Death</hi> is a dividing of us from this life, and from the things of this life, and sends us abroad we know not where.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Nature teacheth us three Properties concerning <note place="margin">2. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of death, That it is 1. Universall.</note> 
                     <hi>Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One, that it is <hi>universall.</hi> It hath tied all to it, high and low, rich and poore. <hi>Death</hi> knockes at the Princes pallace, as well as at the poore habitation of the meanest man. It is a thing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects no mans greatnesse, it regardeth no wealth, nor wit, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; <hi>Death</hi> takes all before it. That Nature teacheth too.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; Nature teacheth that <hi>Death</hi> is <hi>inevitable.</hi> If a man <note place="margin">2. Inevitable.</note> would give all the world, he cannot thrust it out of dores. It takes whole Armies aswell as one man. It scorneth to bee resisted by the Phisitians: there is no words, no meanes to escape it. It is such an enemie as we must grapple with, and it will conquer. This Nature teacheth.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Nature teacheth that <hi>death</hi> is <hi>uncertaine.</hi> A man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not when <hi>Death</hi> will come to him, or when it will lay hold on <note place="margin">3. Uncertaine.</note> him, or by what meanes it will fetch him out of the world. It may fetch him out of the world at any time, or in any place, and by such occasion, as it is impossible for any wit to thinke of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This is in substance all that Nature teacheth. And the knowledge of this, it is for good use, aswell to remember and consider it, as to understand it.</p>
                  <p>But now I goe on to tell yee, what the Scripture teacheth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Death:</hi> for that giveth a perfecter and larger information of the thing, then the dimme light of Nature.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture then (over and above that which Nature sheweth) telleth us concerning <hi>Death</hi> these things.</p>
                  <p>First, it sheweth better what it is; and then</p>
                  <p>It sheweth whence it commeth, and what are the causes of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it declareth the consequences what follow upon it.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, and bestly, it telleth us the remedie against the ill of <hi>Death.</hi> In all which Nature stumbleth, and can doe little or <note place="margin">The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth 1. What death is.</note> nothing.</p>
                  <p>First, the Scripture telleth us what it is; It letteth us know that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:14764:77"/>
it is the disolution of a man, not the annihilation; It doth not make him cease to bee, but takes asunder a while the soule from the body: It carrieth the one to the earth, and the other to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world: so that both continue to bee, though they be not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as before.</p>
                  <p>The word of God teacheth us, that he hath created the world (as it were) a house of three Stories. The middle is this present life where we be. And there is a lower place, the Dungeon, a place of unhappinesse and destruction. There is a higher place, a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of glory. According as men behave themselves in this mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle roome; so <hi>Death</hi> either leadeth them downe to the place of unhappinesse, or conveyeth them up to the pallace of glory and blessednesse. This, Nature is ignorant of, but the Scripture is plaine in. The <hi>rich man dieth,</hi> and his soule is carried to Hell; the poore man when he died, his soule was advanced to Heaven. So that <hi>Death</hi> is nothing but the messenger of God to take the soule out of the body, and to convey it to a place of more happinesse, or more miserie then can be conceived.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Scripture acquaints us further with the cause of <note place="margin">2. What are the causes of death.</note> 
                     <hi>death.</hi> Philosophers wondred since nature desireth a perpetuitie, and continuance of it selfe, that man should be so short a time in the world. The Scripture endeth this wonderment, and tels us that man indeed was made immortall, to continue for ever, and should not have died: but <hi>sinne came into the world, and by sin death. Death</hi> is the mother of sinne, and of all miserie, that by little and little draweth to <hi>death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I say sinne: the first sinne of our first Parents whereby they transgressed that most easie and equall mandate about eating the forbidden fruit. That transgression that was the treading under foot the covenant of workes, and the disanulling of it, that sinne let in <hi>Death</hi> at a great Gappe: and now it triumpheth, and beareth rule over all the world.</p>
                  <p>Nature cannot tell which way in the world a man should die so soone, and that hee that is the Lord of all creatures, should bee inferiour to a great number of them in length of life. But the word of God unridleth this riddle, and telleth us that God made man, that hee might and should have lived for ever, but Sinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and comming in the person of the first man, it brought <hi>death,</hi> and made all men mortall: and when sinne entred, Gods curse came, and that working upon us poore and miserable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is the cause that we cannot continue long here.</p>
                  <p>It was equall that <hi>death</hi> should follow sinne, for since God made man to obey his will, when man had unfitted himselfe for Gods service, it was reason that he should have a short continance of life, for the longer he endured, the more he would abuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>

                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:14764:78"/>
Yee see then two things that the Scripture teacheth concerning death. The third thing it sheweth is, what followeth after death: <note place="margin">3. What are the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of death. Heb. 9. 27.</note> and that is plaine; <hi>It is appointed for all men once to die, and after death commeth judgement.</hi> Nature never dreamed of judgement after <hi>Death,</hi> but the Scripture telleth us, there is a Judgement after <hi>Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Judgement, what is that?</p>
                  <p>Judgement (yee know) is a calling of a man before Authoritie, a looking into his wayes, a considering of his actions, a finding out whether hee be a sinner, an evill doer: and if hee find him so, to passe sentence according to his evill deeds. When God hath tooke the soule from the body, hee takes the soule first, and after both soule and body, and presents them before his owne Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and there searcheth into every mans life, ransacks his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, lookes deepe into his conversation, and inquireth into his secrets, openeth his actions, and whole carriage from his infancie to his last breath, and findeth out the things that hee hath done, and passeth sentence according to that he hath done.</p>
                  <p>This Judgement hath two degrees. First assoone as a man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <note place="margin">The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</note> No sooner is the soule separated from this case (as it were) the bodie, but instantly it is presented before the Lord Jesus Christ, and there he passeth sentence, either that it is a true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, a godly liver, a person united to Christ, that walked as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the Gospell of Christ, and then it receiveth glory, and joy, and blisse for the present, more then tongue expresse. Or else it findeth against him, that he was a sinfull man, a wicked man, a hypocrite, a dissembler, one that named Christ with his tongue, but did not <hi>depart from iniquitie,</hi> nor live according to the Gospell of Christ: and then he is delivered up to Sathan, to bee hurried downe to Hell, and there to suffer the wrath of God according to the desert of so great wickednesse. This particular judgement passeth upon every soule assoone as it leaveth the Body.</p>
                  <p>Then followeth the great universall Judgement, when soule <note place="margin">The generall Judgement.</note> and body shall be reunited, and stand before God: every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man that ever hath beene, is, or shall be, every man shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in their owne persons, their whole lives shall be laied open, all secret things shall bee made knowne, for God (saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle) <hi>shall judge the secrets of all hearts by Iesus Christ according to my Gospell.</hi> This is the third thing that the word of God informeth us concerning <hi>death,</hi> that nature could never doe.</p>
                  <p>The last, that is the best, the Scripture giveth us a remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">4. What is the remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the evil of death.</note> the ill of <hi>Death.</hi> It is a pittifull thing to heare of mortalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and sicknesse, if there were not a good Potion or Phisicke pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to escape the ill of it. To heare tell of <hi>Death,</hi> and so tell, as the Scripture saith, that it is a going to another world of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:14764:78"/>
weale or woe, and not to heare of a remedie, it is wofull tydings, and would wring teares from a hard heart.</p>
                  <p>But the Scripture makes report of <hi>death,</hi> not onely tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and easie, but comfortable and gladsome to a Christian heart: for it sheweth by whom, and by what meanes we may infallibly, and certainly, escape all the hurt that <hi>Death</hi> can doe: Nay, by what meanes we may order our selves so, that <hi>Death</hi> may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to us. What is that?</p>
                  <p>In one short word; It is Christ; <hi>I am the resurrection, and the life, hee that beleeveth in mee, shall never see death.</hi> Hee meaneth to hurt himselfe. Againe, <hi>This is the message, that God hath given us life, and this life is in his Sonne.</hi> And, <hi>Hee that hath the Sonne hath life.</hi> Our Saviour Jesus Christ came into the world (as the Apostle tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us) <hi>that hee might destroy him that had the power of death, and so set them at libertie, that all their life-time were in bondage under the feare of death.</hi> And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith; <hi>Hee came into the world to destroy the workes of the divell:</hi> which are sinne and death. So that now <hi>Death</hi> hath lost his sting, because Christ overcame it: in dying hee slue <hi>Death,</hi> and was the death of <hi>Death:</hi> this man Christ, God and Man, hee offered himselfe to his Father as a Sacrifice for the sinnes of the world, and dying a cursed death upon the Crosse, so satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the justice of God on the behalfe of all those that are in him, that <hi>death</hi> can doe them no harme: It is nothing else but a passage to eternall blessednesse.</p>
                  <p>Oh blessed be the name of God, that hath beene pleased to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide so perfect a remedie against so mortall an enemie: and to lay it open so clearely and plainly in the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>Yee have heard of those things that I thought to put yee in mind of concerning <hi>Death,</hi> and so I have done with the first point.</p>
                  <p>The second is, That <hi>Death is an enemie.</hi> Therefore the Apostle <note place="margin">2. Death is an enemie.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us of a certaine <hi>sting</hi> it hath, <hi>Oh Death where is thy sting?</hi> It is an armed enemie, it commeth as a Serpent with a <hi>sting</hi> that entreth into a mans soule, putteth it to extreame perplexitie, if he takes not order to disarme this enemie.</p>
                  <p>An enemie yee know is a person that setteth himselfe wilfully to hurt; a man may hurt his neighbour, either through indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or unadvisednesse against his will, or hee may lay waite to doe him hurt, intending mischiefe, and seeking to performe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that shall bee injurious to him. Wee call not him an enemie that we receive a little hurt from against his will, contrary to his purpose and intention: but he that studieth, and beforehand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth to be an enemie. Now <hi>Death</hi> (as we may say) studieth our hurt in all extremitie before-hand.</p>
                  <p>There is but two sorts of hurt that can come to a man. One
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14764:79"/>
is, to deprive him of that which is beneficiall and comfortable, <note place="margin">1. Depriving a man of all that is bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall or comfortable.</note> to robbe him of all that is contentfull to him in this life. As when a company of Foes breake into a Nation, they burne their goods, and spoile their houses, and robbe and take away all that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to them, so much as they can. <hi>Death</hi> is such an <hi>enemie:</hi> It desireth to bereave a man of that necessarie contentment hee hath. When it meeteth with a learned man, it takes away all his learning at one blow, assoone as he is dead, hee ceaseth to bee a great scholler. It commeth to a rich man, and robbes him of all his goods at one blow too: though he have millions, <hi>Death</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth all to be another mans. When it commeth to a King, it pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him beside his Throne, takes his Crowne off his head, and casteth both him and it into the dust, hee is king no longer when hee is dead. And so in all the benefits of this life, it takes away the pleasure and contentments of a man; it takes away the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band from the wife, and the wife from the husband; it divideth children from Parents, and Parents from children: all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that this life afford, <hi>death</hi> strippeth a man of them all, and turnes him naked out of the world, just <hi>as hee came hee must goe, and carry nothing in his hand: Death</hi> will not admit him to take one farthing, or any thing else with him. So he is an <hi>enemie,</hi> for hee spoileth us of whatsoever is desirable in this life.</p>
                  <p>But he is an <hi>enemie</hi> also in inflicting a great deale of ill upon men. So <hi>death</hi> bringeth torment for the present: It is a terrible <note place="margin">2. Inflicting misery upon a man.</note> thing to wrestle with; it makes a man bleed, and sweat as it were: No man can incounter with <hi>death,</hi> but he feeleth anxietie and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of body and minde, (unlesse hee have comfort from above to enable him to wrestle with it, but) in his owne proper nature it is so furious an <hi>enemie,</hi> that it doth not cease till it hath dragged the soule into the presence of God, and after, from his Tribunall to the torment of eternall fire in Hell. That succeedeth <hi>death,</hi> for naturally of its owne nature it tendeth to the destruction of man, because it is a fruit of sinne, and therefore must needs be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and overthrow of the soule. For sinne bringeth destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in regard it makes God angrie with us, and separateth from him, and by consequence from all manner of comfort: and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it separateth from him, it bringeth all manner of ill, his wrath, his hatred, and ill will the greatest of all. <hi>Death</hi> (I say) properly, and of it selfe intendeth, and seekes to draw all those that it layes hold on to a state of everlasting unhappinesse, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is an enemie. So you see the second point opened.</p>
                  <p>The third is, that <hi>Death is the last enemie,</hi> after which there shall bee no more. <note place="margin">3. Death the last enemy:</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I must tell you to whom it is the last, not to all. For there <note place="margin">Not to all.</note> are a generation of men that shall feele <hi>death</hi> to be the least of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14764:79"/>
and in a manner the first. But to the Saints and those that <note place="margin">But to the Saints.</note> are prepared for <hi>death,</hi> and those that will use the remedie, to these, and these alone, <hi>death</hi> is the last enemie: after once they have grappled, and fought, and encountred with this <hi>enemie,</hi> they are at peace and rest; as he saith, <hi>Happy are they that die in the Lord, for they rest from their labours.</hi> There is no more toyle and miserie to a good man after death. And why? Because, <hi>death</hi> seperateth sin from his soule, as well as the soule from the body, and so taking away the cause of unrest, it must needs take away miserie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happinesse it selfe.</p>
                  <p>Indeed properly, <hi>Death</hi> doth it not, but the Lord Iesus Christ by death. For it pleaseth him when his servants leave this world, then they are fit to enter into a place of happinesse in another world, which they could not be, except they were freed from sin. <hi>Death</hi> is the daughter of sinne, and with a happy patricide (as it were) at once it destroyeth it selfe and sin: and therfore it takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all misery, because it takes away all sinne. Therefore it is the last enemie, because it killeth the worst of our enemies, for when we are dead, there shall be no more enmitie betweene God and us, and so no more enemy. This is the third point.</p>
                  <p>The last is, that <hi>this enemie shall bee destroyed.</hi> A thing is destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">4. Death shall be destroyed.</note> abolished, when it selfe ceaseth to be, and is tooke out of the way, and when all the ill effects that it would produce, and effect or hath, are removed. So the Lord Jesus Christ abolisheth <hi>Death,</hi> he destroyeth it, that it shall never againe be knowne in the world, or felt by his servants: and he preventeth all those evill effects that it would worke in the soule for eternitie, and removeth all the ill effects of it, that it hath wrought on their bodies for the present time. <hi>Death</hi> takes away a mans goods for the present, Christ abolisheth that, he giveth everlasting substance in heaven. <hi>Death</hi> takes away friends, Christ abolisheth that, hee sends us to heaven, where we have more friends and better. <hi>Death</hi> brings the body to rottennesse and corruption, it laieth it in the dust, turnes it to putrifaction, Christ abolisheth that, at the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it <hi>shall rise againe in glory.</hi> How that is done the Apostle tells us in the end of this chapter; The body shall be laid in the dust, a weake and feeble, a mortall and naturall body, but it shall bee clothed with immortalitie; <hi>This mortall shall put on immortalitie, this corruptible shall put on incorruption, then shall bee fulfilled that saying, Death is swallowed up in victorie.</hi> But this is also limited, it shall bee destroyed, to whom? To those that use the remedie, those that partake of Christ, those that have put on him that is the <hi>Resurrection and the life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus I have laid before your eyes briefly these foure things, that the Apostle leadeth us to treate of concerning death. That it
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14764:80"/>
is; That it is an enemie. That it is the last enemie. And that it shall be destroyed. Now I desire to apply this, and to make use of it.</p>
                  <p>First, I shall be bold to play the Examiner, to search each con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. For Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> a little. Brethren, let the word of God enter into your soules. Yee heare that there is a <hi>death,</hi> and that this <hi>death</hi> is a sore and bitter <hi>enemie:</hi> and yee heare that to some sort of men it is the <hi>last enemie</hi> that ever they shall encounter with, and bee freed from all the hurt of it, it shall be utterly destroyed. Now doe so much as discend every one into himselfe, and inquire what care there hath beene to prepare for <hi>death,</hi> to make use of the remedie against <hi>death:</hi> what time and paines hath beene bestowed to seeke to get that that is the only meanes to escape the Dart of this enemie, and that that is the only cause to procure this enfranchisement to the soule, from that that else will destroy all.</p>
                  <p>A man hath not fitted himselfe to encounter with his enemie, when hee lookes after wealth, and followeth the pleasures and contentments of this life; these things will doe no good, they will be rather a burthen to the heart, and vexe the soule, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the mischiefe, laying more sin upon the soule, and giving <hi>death</hi> darts to pierce the soule with.</p>
                  <p>But when is a man fit for <hi>death?</hi> and who may encounter with this enemie with safetie?</p>
                  <p>I will tell yee; That man that takes the greatest care to disarme <note place="margin">How a man may be fitted for death. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Get death disarmed now.</note> 
                     <hi>death</hi> of his weapons, to arme himselfe with defensive weapons against <hi>death.</hi> If an enemie come upon a man with good weapons in his hand, and find him altogether unweaponed, it is hard for a naked unarmed man to deale with him: it is hard for a man that never thought of it before, to fight with one that is skilfull at his weapons. <hi>Death</hi> (I told yee) is <hi>an enemie,</hi> and an <hi>enemie</hi> that is skilfull in his weapons: and the weapon of <hi>death</hi> it is our owne sinne. <hi>Death</hi> bringeth nothing with it to hurt a man; It findeth with us, and in us, that whereby to hurt us. So many corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as are in thy heart, so many weapons. So many idle words so many bad deedes; so many swords to pierce thy heart. <hi>Death</hi> maketh use of those weapons it findeth in our selves, and with them hee destroyeth, and killeth, and brings us to perdition.</p>
                  <p>Now, what have yee done (beloved) to disarme <hi>death?</hi> what care have yee taken to breake sinne apieces, that it may not be as a sword ready drawne for the hand of <hi>death</hi> when it commeth? as Arrowes in a Bow, to shoot at you, when <hi>Death</hi> laieth hold on you?</p>
                  <p>That man that hath tooke no care to overcome sinne in the power of it, and to get himselfe free from the guilt and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14764:80"/>
of it, is unfit for <hi>death.</hi> If <hi>death</hi> come upon him, and find his offences unrepented of, unpardoned, unsubdued, he will so order those offences, that he will thrust them into his soule, as so many poisoned Darts, that will bring sorrow, and anguish, and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and destruction to all eternitie.</p>
                  <p>Ye may see then whether yee have any fitnesse to meet with this Enemie, whether yee be in case to fight that battell; that of necessitie yee must; for <hi>Death</hi> (as I told yee before) is enevitable.</p>
                  <p>If yee have not; Get alone betweene God and thy selfe, and there call to mind the corruption of thy nature, the sinnes of thy childhood, of thy body, of thy mind, bring thy soule into his presence, confesse thy sinnes, with an endevour to breake thy heart for them, and to be sorry for them, mightily crying to him in the mediation of that blessed Advocate Jesus Christ, that died on the Crosse, to pardon, and to wash thy soule in his bloud, and to deliver thee from the pollution of thy sinnes. Begge the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of sanctification to beate downe those sinnes, and subdue thy corruptions. Bestow time to performe these exercises daily, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully present thy selfe before God, thus to renew thy repentance and faith in Christ, to make thy peace with God: Labour to purge away the filthinesse of thy sinne, and then whensoever <hi>Death</hi> commeth, thou shalt find in thy selfe sufficient against it, thou hast disarmed it.</p>
                  <p>But if yee spend your time in pursuing profits and pleasures, and follow the vanities of this life, and either yee doe not thinke of <hi>death,</hi> or yee thinke of it no otherwise then a heathen man would have done, to no purpose; yee thinke of it to enjoy the world while yee live, because yee know not how soone <hi>death</hi> will end the world and you, if you play the Epicures in the thought of <hi>Death,</hi> to annimate you to enjoy the outward benefits of this life: to thinke of it to no purpose, but only to talke and discourse now and then as occasion serveth: then <hi>Death</hi> will find your soules la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with innumerable sinnes that repentance hath not discharged, and undoubtedly it will bring eternall perdition. Have yee thus disarmed <hi>Death?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But againe, a mans selfe must be armed, or else hee cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with his <hi>enemie,</hi> What is our Armour against <hi>Death</hi> to <note place="margin">2. Get armour against death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>The Apostle in one word sheweth us these Armours, when hee saith, a <hi>Breast-plate of faith, and love, and the hope of salvation a Helmet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a man have got faith to rest on Christ alone for eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, and his soule filled with the hope of glory, and salvation through him, and then with love to him, and his servants for his sake; These three vertues will secure a man against all the hurt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14764:81"/>
that <hi>death</hi> can doe. <hi>Faith, Hope, and Charitie,</hi> the Cardinall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that Christian religion requires, and commands us to seeke, these are Armour of proofe against all the blowes of <hi>death:</hi> hee that hath them shall never be hurt of <hi>Death,</hi> because he shall never taste of the second <hi>death:</hi> he hath onely to wrestle with the first Death, and there is no terrour, nor terriblenesse in that, if a mans heart be secure by these Graces.</p>
                  <p>Faith whereby we depend on Christ, and on him alone for grace and salvation, bringing hope whereby we expect and looke for salvation of our soules by his bloud according to his promise, and working charitie whereby we love him for his goodnesse, and his servants for his sake (If it be charitie not onely of the lip to speake well, but that that produceth wel-doing) I say this is that makes us that <hi>death</hi> cannot separate us from Christ, but the further we are from life, the neerer we are to him, for when this outward <hi>taber nacle of</hi> our house <hi>is dissolved, we have a building with God eternall in the heavens:</hi> and <hi>death</hi> to such a man is nothing but the opening of the dore to let him out of the dungeon of the world, and to place him happily in the Pallace of eternall blisse.</p>
                  <p>I pray enter into consideration how yee have behaved your selves in the course of your lives, whether as Heathens, or as Christians. A man that takes no care to prepare for <hi>death,</hi> though he come to the Church from Sunday to Sunday, and partake of all Gods ordinances, yet if the consideration of <hi>death</hi> bee not so imprinted in him, that it become a motive to him to labour for Faith, and hope, and charitie, and to endeavour to edifie himselfe in these graces, he liveth as a Heathen or an Infidell: and when <hi>death</hi> commeth to him, it will doe him more hurt, then it will an Infidell, because by how much God hath given him more meanes to escape, and by neglecting those meanes, as his sin is greater, so shall his punishment be.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if yee have beene carelesse for to prepare for this <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. For repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension.</note> 
                     <hi>enemie;</hi> Now be ashamed of it, and sorrow for it, let your hearts now smite yee, and ake within you: Oh foolish man or woman (say) I have lived twenty, thirty, forty, fifty yeares, and some more; I have laboured against other enemies, if men had any thing against me, I would be sure to take order; I have laboured for the things of this life, for riches and friends, and given my selfe leave for to enjoy pleasures, and taken paines to doe good to my body: but all this while it never came into my heart seriously to thinke, I must die, <hi>and after that commeth judgement,</hi> that I must stand before Gods Tribunall, and give account of my wayes, I have not laboured to beware of <hi>Death</hi> and of sinne, nor to kill my corruptions, I have not laboured to increase in <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>charitie;</hi> I have left my selfe unarmed against the last and

worst enemie. Oh what folly is this, to live in the world many a long day, and never to consider, that there will be an end of all these dayes, and the end of those, the beginning of another life, and a life that will be infinitely more miserable then this.</p>
                  <p>If this (beloved) have beene any of your faults to be carelesly forgetfull of your latter end, not to consider of your departure hence: if the world have so tempted you, and pleasures have so enamoured you, that you have forgotten your latter end, blame your selves, it is the greatest of all follies.</p>
                  <p>And that I may disgrace this folly, and make you ashamed of it; Consider a little. That this is to be like children; The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle biddeth us not to be like children in understanding: but hee that forgetteth <hi>Death,</hi> and is carelesse to prepare for it, is a very child. A little one never thinketh hee shall ever bee a man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and maintaine himselfe, and live in the world by his owne labour, or by that he shall have from his friends, he careth for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but meat, and drinke, and sport, and pastime: wee blame their folly, and laugh at it as rediculous, and therefore by our diligence we prevent that ill that might else come upon them. Is it not thus with many of you? yee live and build houses, and raise your names to be glorious, and to make a faire shew in the world: but to get grace, and to get faith, and hope, and love, and repentance, none of your thoughts almost runne that way, scarce any of your thoughts are so bestowed. Is not this to be children in understanding.</p>
                  <p>Againe, he is a foolish man that knoweth he shall meet an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and will not prepare. If a man should heare of twenty or thirty thousand souldiers were gathered against the Citie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged it to destroy it; He would not be so foolish, and so simple then, as to bestow himselfe in his trade, and to follow his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and to give himselfe to merriment, but hee would get his weapons, and he would looke about him, helpe to arme the City, and to make it strong. Why doe yee not consider that your soule is as a Citie? <hi>Death</hi> will come against it, and batter you with sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, with paines, and at last will certainly take it, and if the soule be not prepared will carry it to Hell fire. Why will you be so retchlesse, and senslesse to eate and drinke, and labour to grow rich, to bury your selves in earthly labours, and never thinke how to escape, how <hi>Death</hi> may be kept out, that will destroy soule and body?</p>
                  <p>I presume you are ashamed of this folly by this time, I hope yee will goe away with remorse and sorrow, for so carelesly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting a thing of so great importance to be provided for.</p>
                  <p>In the third place therefore I entreate you, begin this great <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3. For Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> worke this day. Consider (if you have not begun) the enemie

lieth in waite for thee, oh man or woman, if thou bee never so young, thou maist meet with him before night, if thou bee old, thou must meet with him ere long. Prepare for him betime; thinke what an enemy may encounter thee in the way. If a man be to travell, though he be not assured to meet with an <hi>enemie,</hi> yet he will strive to get good company, and weapon himselfe, he will carry his sword, something he will doe, that if a theefe come to robbe him, he may be able to prevent the danger. Beloved, thinke that there is an enemy that way-laies us, as we goe along in the world, one time or other he will be sure to come upon us: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore stirre up your selves, begin this day to prepare for this <hi>enemie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How shall I prepare for <hi>Death?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I told you before, it is not amisse in a word to repeat it. Get <hi>Faith</hi> in Christ, and <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charitie,</hi> and Repentance. These will be meanes to prepare and helpe thee against <hi>Death.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (if hitherto thou have not) lament and bewaile the sinfulnesse of thy nature and life. Assoone as thou art out of this place, get thee into a solitarie roome, fall upon thy knees, lament thy sinnes, the ilnesse of thy nature and carriage, rehearse thy wayes as much as thou canst, condemne thy selfe before God, mightily crie for pardon in the mediation of his Sonne, and never leave sobbing and mourning, till he hath given thee some answer that hee is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. And then strive to get faith in Christ, call to mind the perfection of his redemption, the excellencie of his person and merits, that thou maist repose thy soule on him, that thou maist say, though my sinnes be as the Stars, and exceed them, yet the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of my Saviour, and his satisfaction to the justice of God it is full: in him he is well pleased and reconciled, I will stay on him. Lord Christ, thou hast done and suffered enough to redeeme mee and Man-kind, thou hast suffered for the propitiation of the world, though my sinnes deserve a thousand damnations, yet I trust upon thy mercie, according to the Covenant made in thy Word. Thus when a man laboureth to cast himselfe on Christ, to lay the burthen of his salvation, and to venter his soule on him, now he hath beleeved, this Breast-plate, <hi>Death</hi> is not able to thrust through.</p>
                  <p>And then, labour that this faith may worke so strongly, that it may breed <hi>Hope,</hi> a constant and firme expectation grounded on the promises of the Word, that thou shalt bee saved, and goe to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and be admitted into the presence of God, when thou shalt be separated from this lower world. Hee that is armed with this hope, hath a <hi>Helmet, Death</hi> shall never hurt his head; it shall never be able to take away his comfort and peace; He shall smile at the approach of <hi>death,</hi> because it can doe nothing but helpe him to his kingdome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:14764:82"/>
And then, labour for <hi>Charitie,</hi> to inflame thee to him againe, that hath shewed himselfe so truly loving to men, as to seeke them when they were lost, to redeeme them when they were captives, and to restore them from that unhappinesse, that they had cast themselves innto. Oh that I could love thee, and thy people for thy sake, thou diddest die for them, shall not I be at a little cost and paines to helpe them out of miserie.</p>
                  <p>Thus if yee labour to be furnished with these graces, then you are armed against <hi>Death;</hi> those will doe you more good, then if you had gotten millions of millions of gold and silver. As you have understanding for the outward man, as you have care to provide for that, to preserve and comfort life, while you are here, so have a care for the future world, and that boundlesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of eternitie. If a man live miserably here, <hi>death</hi> will end it, if he be prepared for <hi>death,</hi> he shall live happily for ever; but if a man live happily (as we account it) and die miserably, that misery is endlesse. Yee mistake (beloved) yee account men happy that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in wealth and honour, that have great estates, I say yee mistake in accounting men happy, that enjoy the good things of this life, that can live in prosperitie to the last time of their age, possessing what they have gotten. If such a man be not prepared for <hi>death; Death</hi> makes way for a greater unhappinesse after death. For the more sinne he hath committed, the more miserie shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide him, his life being nothing but a continued chaine of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse one linke upon another, till he settle upon a preparation for Death.</p>
                  <p>And in the last place, here is a great deale of comfort, to those <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 4. For comfort.</note> that have laboured to prepare for <hi>death:</hi> though to them <hi>Death is an enemie,</hi> yet it is an <hi>enemie</hi> that is utterly <hi>destroyed.</hi> The Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher said, that <hi>Death is the terriblest of all terrible things;</hi> so it is to nature, because it doth that that no other evill can doe, it separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from all comfort; and carrieth us we know not whether.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Death</hi> is terrible to a man that is unarmed for <hi>death;</hi> but to the poore Saints that have bestowed their time in humiliation, and supplication, and confession, that have daily endevoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>repentance, Death</hi> hath no manner of terriblenesse in the world: if it bee terrible to a Christian at the first, it is onely because he hath forgot himselfe a little, he doth not bethinke how he is armed.</p>
                  <p>If God have fitted his servants for <hi>death,</hi> he hath done most for them: if they have not riches, yet they are fit for <hi>death:</hi> if they have not an estate amongst men, it mattereth not a whit if they be fit for <hi>Death,</hi> if they be miserable here, in torments and sicknesse, when others have health, it is no matter, all these increase their repentance, makes them labour for Faith, and Hope, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14764:83"/>
whereby they are armed against <hi>Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing can save us from the hurt of <hi>Death,</hi> but the Lord Jesus Christ, put on by <hi>Faith,</hi> and that furnished with <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Charitie.</hi> If God give a man other things and not these graces, <hi>Death</hi> is not <hi>destroyed</hi> to him. But if he deny him other things, and give him these graces, he doth enough for him, <hi>Death is destroyed</hi> to him. His body indeed falleth under the stroake of <hi>Death</hi> as other mens, but his soule is not hurt. <hi>Death</hi> layeth him a rotting as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort, but the soule goeth to the possession of glory, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth with Christ; <hi>When hee is absent from the body, hee is present with the Lord.</hi> Nay, when the last day shall come, <hi>Death</hi> shall bee utterly <hi>swallowed up,</hi> then the poore, and fraile, and weake body, that sleepeth in corruption and mortalitie, shall bee raised in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and in immortall beautie and glory, a spirituall body, free from all corporall weaknesses that accompany the naturall body: it shall be made most glorious and blessed, even as if it were a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, all the weaknesses that accompany the naturall beeing of the body shall be taken away, and it shall enjoy as much perfection as a body can, and therefore it is called spirituall: Therefore I beseech you rejoyce in the Lord if your soules tell you, that you are armed against this <hi>death.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I first began this verse, I did never thinke that all things would have beene so sutable, to the finishing of it, as now I find they are. For there is no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that can be required to make a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondencie betweene a former, and a lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter handling, but is to be found in the two surveies I tooke upon this Text. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of handling it now, is the same that was before. I began it at a Funerall, and now at another Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall I shall end it. The place of handling, the same as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I began the former part of the verse, in this very street, at the other end of it: Now I shall finish it at this. And the time, it is the same, and every way answerable to that it was before. It was begun in a time of Mortalitie feared; and now will be finished in a time of mortalitie certaine. And that there should be no part of correspondencie wanting: this latter part of the verse is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the former, it is but the same againe in other words. In the former part there is mention of the <hi>righteous man,</hi> here of the <hi>mercifull man,</hi> they are both one. In that, <hi>hee is said to perish,</hi> here to <hi>bee taken away,</hi> they are both the same. There, <hi>No man is said to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14764:85"/>
lay it to heart;</hi> and here <hi>no man is said to consider it.</hi> Both the same. So that loke upon the whole, both parts joyne together: they walke on by paires two and two, as the living creatures into the Arke, Male and Female. The first paire sets forth to you the state and condition of a godly man, he is <hi>righteous and mercifull:</hi> those are the male and female of Pietie. The second sets forth to you the state and condition of a dying man, hee <hi>perisheth and is taken away:</hi> those are the Male and Female of death. The third sets out the state and condition of a worldly man, he <hi>layes it not to heart, he never takes it into consideration:</hi> those are the Male and Female of carnall securitie. And that all the paires should now be made up: the former part was handled at the buriall of a good old Man: this latter now at the buriall of an old and verteous Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: those are the Male and Female of nature. The former part, that is a complaint that the Prophet made; and so is the second; and this second is set as a Commentarie to the first; this latter part is as <hi>Eve</hi> created as a helpe to <hi>Adam,</hi> for every word in this latter helpes to expound some word in the former. The first word in the latter part tells us of the <hi>mercifull man,</hi> that is the Exposition of the first word in the former part, <hi>the righteus man.</hi> Lest any man should make question who this righteous man was, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet speakes of, how we should know him, and define him, and find him; find me a mercifull man, and hee is truly a righteous man. The second word in the latter part is, <hi>taken away,</hi> that hath reference to the second word in the former, and it is a qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the harshnesse of the former: there it is said, <hi>The righteous man perisheth:</hi> but lest any man should scandal at this word, shall we thinke that he <hi>perisheth, whose life it hid with Christ in God?</hi> Shall the Scripture say that <hi>hee perisheth,</hi> whose <hi>name is in the bundle of life, written in heaven?</hi> To lay aside therefore the rigour of the word, here is the Qualification, <hi>hee is taken away.</hi> The third word of the latter hath reference to the third of the former too, <hi>No man consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth it.</hi> If any man aske the reason, how it comes to passe, that people should be without naturall affection, that they take it not to heart, that they are not grieved for <hi>Ioseph,</hi> that they are not stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with any sense of their owne losses, what should be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it? The reason is in this word, <hi>they take it not into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> They trouble not their heads, and therefore not their hearts with it. (That it may make an aggravation of that.) They were so farre from taking of it to heart, that they never propounded it to the examination, and scanning of their judgement, <hi>they consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it not.</hi> So every word in the latter part is serviceable to the first.</p>
                  <p>I shewed concerning the first part, who this <hi>Righteous man is,</hi> how great the dignation of the Spirit of God is, that hee will
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14764:85"/>
stile holy men, that are so imperfect in holinesse, yet because of their holy endeavours to walke in the wayes of God blamelesly, the Spirit stiles them <hi>Righteous men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, I shewed how this <hi>Righteous man</hi> is said <hi>to perish:</hi> and in what sense; and how it is impossible they should <hi>perish;</hi> and why the Holy Ghost chooseth <hi>this word,</hi> which is more then death, to set out to us the death of the <hi>Righteous man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then the last considered in particular; how it is lawfull to mourne for the departure of those that are gone: how that God alloweth that, how that God blameth for the neglect of it: <hi>Men are to lay it to heart,</hi> to grive. How farre this griefe is to extend. These were the heads of those things that concerne the first part.</p>
                  <p>I now goe on forward to the second.</p>
                  <p>And that is a complaint (as the former was) that the Prophet takes up over the people of the <hi>Iewes</hi> for their great stupiditie, in <hi>that they considered not</hi> any worke of God toward them; And it hath these two parts.</p>
                  <p>There is the complaint he takes up over the dead: <hi>Mercifull men</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The division of the Text.</note> 
                     <hi>are taken away from the evill to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the other complaint he takes up over the living, those that <note place="margin">1</note> are living and survive them, they care not though heaven and <note place="margin">2</note> earth bee mingled together, though they lose all their proppes whereby the earth is supported, <hi>they never consider it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I begin with the first of these. And that is; <note place="margin">The first part of the Text.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The complaint that is taken up over the <hi>Righteus mans</hi> departure. In that I consider two things;</p>
                  <p>First, looke to the meaning of the words.</p>
                  <p>And then see, what were the motives that made the Prophet <note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the words.</note> take up this complaint and lamentation: that whereas others wanted it, the Prophet should supply it, and should give testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to their departure; <hi>The righteous are taken away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First for the meaning of the words. <note place="margin">1. Of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men,</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a proposition, and there are three parts of it.</p>
                  <p>The subject of the proposition, <hi>Mercifull men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The predicat, <hi>Are taken away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Affix anexed to it, <hi>from the evill to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Briefly, looke upon the meaning of all these, and they will all afford us some instruction.</p>
                  <p>The first is the subject of this proposition; It is said here (and it varieth from the former) <hi>Mercifull men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man would wonder why he should alter the stile, except it were, because the Spirit of God delighteth to set out godly men, according to the multitude of their titles, <hi>the righteous and mercifull men:</hi> otherwise the same terme might have beene kept in the latter
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:14764:86"/>
part, for they are both the same in effect. He that is a <hi>mercifull man</hi> is a <hi>Righteous man,</hi> and he that is <hi>righteous</hi> will be <hi>mercifull:</hi> yet the Prophet varieth it, <hi>righteous men perish, and mercifull men are taken away.</hi> There is some speciall reason of the variation. I conceive it is one of these three, or all.</p>
                  <p>The first reason why he useth this word <hi>(mercifull men)</hi> in the latter part is. For the greater conviction of their stupiditie. They were such as were not affected with the condition, or losse of <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> and holy men; nay, they were so stupid, that they were not affected with the losse of <hi>mercifull men,</hi> that is more. If there were any sense of pietie, they should for Gods cause grive at the losse of godly men: but if there were any sense of their owne good, there should bee griefe for the losse of <hi>mercifull men.</hi> Generally (if it bee possible to sever them) the world hath more misse of <hi>mercifull men,</hi> then of <hi>righteous men:</hi> every man should mourne for their departure, and misse them, though pietie and righteousness may go unmourned for. But these were come to that stupiditie, that they had no sight nor sense of their owne good: being a <hi>mercifull man,</hi> it is likely there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny naked that he had clothed, many starved soules that he had fed; there were parched bowels that he had simpathyzed with, he used to <hi>mourne with those that mourne,</hi> to lament with those that lament. Many Interpreters would have it spoken, that <hi>Isaiah</hi> said this of himselfe, in regard of the persecution that he suffered, (he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by the Saw:) but whether it were of one <hi>mercifull man,</hi> or of all, a man would thinke that <hi>mercifull men</hi> should not goe out of the world without mourners: there are Orphans and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, that will mourne for mercifull men, that have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by them. Yet this stupiditie so benummed them, in their own senses they were so frozen, that they had no simpathie at all, neither respect to pietie or mercie: <hi>Righteous men were taken away,</hi> and they looked not on that side, <hi>mercifull men were taken away,</hi> and they looked not on that side neither. So it is an aggravation of their stupiditie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another reason why he varieth the word, <hi>Righteous men</hi> first, and <hi>mercifull men</hi> after, is this; To shew how much God honoureth the workes of mercie. Though it bee a glorious title <hi>(A righteous man)</hi> yet the Spirit of God will not let him goe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out another title, A <hi>mercifull man. Righteousnesse</hi> is best knowne to God, but <hi>mercifulnesse</hi> to men. <hi>Mercifulnesse</hi> is an evidence of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and godlinesse. <hi>Mercie</hi> is that grace that honoureth God most, and God honoureth it most. All the high Elogies that are given to pietie in the Scripture, are specially stated on <hi>mercie:</hi> God ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth it with large and ample promises, <hi>Blessed are the mercifull, for they shall obtaine mercie;</hi> It hath not the least be atitude set to it,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14764:86"/>
as <hi>Basil</hi> of <hi>Seuleucia</hi> well observeth. God honoureth it likewise with an approbation, <hi>When I was hungrie yee fed me, when I was thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie yee gave me drinke:</hi> and with a publike approbation at the last day, in the presence of Angels and men, it is <hi>mercie</hi> that God then magnifieth, <hi>Come yee blessed, when I was hungrie, yee fed mee,</hi> &amp;c. God honoureth it likewise with an excellent memoriall, hee alwayes mentioneth it with honour; see it in <hi>Cornelius,</hi> see it in <hi>Iob,</hi> see it in other Saints, they were noted for <hi>mercifulnesse</hi> in the Scripture, here in this place the spirit of God, because the <hi>righteous man</hi> shall not goe without an Epitaph, he makes on <hi>this righteous man</hi> a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoriall. <hi>Mercifull men are taken away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is the second reason, that they might understand how farre God honoureth the workes of Charitie and mercy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that the Prophet might instruct them, and us now, who are to be reputed, and accounted true righteous men. Those that God accounteth so. And those are <hi>mercifull men.</hi> These two, <hi>righteousnesse</hi> and <hi>mercie,</hi> they meet in God, so they must in every Christian. They are the two wayes of God (saith <hi>David) all his waies are mercy and righteousnesse.</hi> They are the two wayes that Christ takes in the world: the first way, at his first comming, a comming of <hi>mercy,</hi> to call men to <hi>mercy;</hi> The second at his second comming, a comming of judgement, to judge the quicke and the dead. So they are two wayes of God, so saith Saint <hi>Bernard;</hi> They are the two feet of God, by which he walketh through the world: God visiteth men upon one of these two feet, either in <hi>mercie,</hi> or in <hi>righteousnesse:</hi> as they are the feet upon which God walketh to us; so they must be the two feet that we walke on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God: <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> that is one, by which we tread the way of the first Table in workes of pietie to God: and <hi>Mercie</hi> is the other, by which we tread the way of the second Table, in mercy towards men. So that as the two Tables kisse each other, they are infolded one in another; the love we owe to our brethren, it hangs and depends on our love to God: the love that wee shew to God, is to be testified by our love to our brethren: So these two are to embrace one anothee, wee must not sever them that God severeth not: according to this, others will judge of us that wee are truly righteous, according to this scantling we take of our selves. Deceive not your selves if there be not workes of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and <hi>mercie,</hi> flatter not your selves with an opinion of <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;</hi> it is an emptie name where <hi>mercie</hi> is not. So the Apostle makes the argument, <hi>Hee that loveth not his brother whom hee hath</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>seene, how can hee love God whom hee hath not seene?</hi> So likewise here, is it possible that there should be <hi>righteousnesse</hi> toward God, when there is not <hi>mercie</hi> toward men?</p>
                  <p>It is the first of those pious instructions, that I will commend
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:14764:87"/>
to this place. Ostentation of <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> there is a great deale in the world, men desire to be accounted godly men, because they can be reserved to themselves. They can get pretences of pietie, and zealous they will seeme to be for workes of the first Table. Did God give onely one Table? No: but we shall bee tried by the workes of the second Table; <hi>When I was hungry, yee fed me not, when I was thirstie, yee gave me no drinke.</hi> Why doe we make boast of pietie to God, that men cannot judge of? For there is one little graine of hypocrisie that spoileth all. We may act mercie to men, but we cannot act pietie: pietie will shew it selfe here; Here is the touch-stone to give proofe of the pietie in our hearts, if it bud out in <hi>mercie:</hi> the <hi>righteous man is mercifull</hi> in every kind. Where there is pietie, there will not be reviling, and disgracing, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling, and contention: it is impossible that pietie in the heart should be contentious, that pure and untainted liquor should passe through a filthy kennell: if there bee grace in the heart, it will shew it selfe in the hand, in the lip, in the words, in the actions, in all. It is but a touch that I give you, I know you easily ghesse where I am. I come not to put you in mind of what you know: or rather to put you in mind. I am not conscious to your courses, but I will tell yee what the world saith; It is a great deale of wrong done to this parish, and this place, if there bee not much contention in it: and it is not upon this occasion that I heard it, for before now I never knew any one in the parish, but as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith of the good workes of one of the Churches, <hi>It is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in all the world,</hi> so the strife of this place is spoken of in all the Citie. Here is the fruit whereby you must examine your selves, mercie to men. If wee be not those that nourish bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love, there will be no mercie: there is no mercie, where there are the fruits of uncharitablenesse, and if there be no mercie, there will be no pietie. Let this therefore be the touch-stone of pietie; love, and peace with men, as the Apostle speakes; <hi>As much</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>as is possible have peace with all men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will speake no more of the meaning of the first part, <hi>Mercifull men are taken away.</hi> It is the Comentary upon the former.</p>
                  <p>The second is the Predicate of the Proposition, <hi>they are taken</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat, they perish.</note> 
                     <hi>away,</hi> that hath reference to this, <hi>they perish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is great wisedome in the Spirit of God thus to expound one word by another. That as in the body of a man, those parts that are of most use, God in wisedome hath made them double, hath made them paires, two eyes, two hands, two eares, &amp;c. (because these are parts of great use) that if one part fall away and misca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the other part may supply; if one eye be out, a man loseth not his sight, he hath another, and so in other parts: so it is in the Scripture: if we mistake one word, here is another that is more
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:14764:87"/>
plaine to lead us right in the meaning of the Scripture: for else men would have beene offended: <hi>Godly men perish?</hi> That is more then to die, that that perisheth is lost. But it is plaine, they are not lost in death. Perishing is one step beyond death? If it had beene predicated of mercilesse, impenitent, unrighteous men, it might have been said so, they perish, they not only die. But <hi>what hath the righteous done? who ever perished being innocent?</hi> Who ever suspected and dreamed, that it was possible for <hi>mercifull men to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish?</hi> Here commeth in the interpretation: No, be not deceived; It is a word frequently used in the world, carnall men thinke so: but they perish not, they are but <hi>tooke away.</hi> Yee see how one word helpeth the other: so this word giveth us assurance of the meaning of this Scripture, and of the state and condition of a <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull man,</hi> hee perisheth not, though the Atheists of the world thinke so: he <hi>perisheth</hi> not to himselfe, for then beginneth his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, when death commeth: though they <hi>perish</hi> to mens me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momoriall and remembrance, there is no <hi>remembrance of the wise</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>man, more then of the foole</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon)</hi> that is, worldly men, that mind the world, and their bellies, they take no more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, when a <hi>righteous man,</hi> a <hi>wise man</hi> dieth, then a <hi>foole;</hi> that is, an impenitent man, though I say they <hi>perish</hi> to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of the world, they <hi>perish</hi> not to God; not to the fruition of his happinesse, for Death is but a porter, a bridge to everlasting life, then beginneth their glory: Heaven that was begun before in a misterie, then it is set open to them literally and personally. They perish not because they are taken away, there is the proofe of it. A man that is removed only from an Inne, no man will say that hee is lost. That that is transplanted from one soile to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doth not perish. A graft or syens, though it be cut off, and it is to have a more noble plantation; It is so farre from perishing, that it is more perfect, it is stablished in its nature, it is set into a better.</p>
                  <p>There are but one of these two interpretations of <hi>perishing,</hi> and neither of them can befall a godly <hi>mercifull</hi> man. Either it is a passage from a beeing, to a not beeing: and so the Beasts when they die, <hi>perish,</hi> because their soules are mortall, as well as their bodies: it is no more a living creature, there is no more life in it, it resolveth to its first principle; the soule it is nourished as well as the body, there was a beeing before, but now there is a nullitie of beeing, in respect of a living creature, there is nothing liveth. Here is a <hi>perishing</hi> from a being, to a not beeing.</p>
                  <p>Againe, <hi>perishing</hi> may be a passage from a being to a worse beeing: so an impenitent man when he dieth, he passeth from life to death; yea, to an eternall death, to a worse beeing; that is a <hi>perishing,</hi> and a proper <hi>perishing,</hi> that is worse then to bee lost.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14764:88"/>
It is better to have no beeing, then to have either of these.</p>
                  <p>But in neither of these senses the <hi>righteous man perisheth:</hi> hee hath a beeing, and a well-beeing after death. His soule hath a real beeing with God in happinesse, his body hath a beeing of hope, though it be in the grave; Nay, it hath a real beeing of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as it is a member of Christ, in regard of the misticall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So in no sense he <hi>perisheth,</hi> he is but <hi>tooke away,</hi> hee is but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, it is but <hi>Exodus,</hi> but <hi>transitus:</hi> his death is not a going out of the Candle, it is but a translation, a removing of it to a better frame, it is set upon a more glorious table to shine more bright. The word is well expounded in the 11. <hi>Hebr.</hi> concerning <hi>Enoch:</hi> whereas in the fifth of <hi>Genesis,</hi> the Scripture saith, <hi>Enoch walked with God, and God tooke him;</hi> in the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> it is said, <hi>he was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</hi> In the one, he was <hi>tooke away,</hi> that is, in respect of the world; In the other, <hi>hee was translated;</hi> that is, in respect of heaven. They are <hi>tooke away;</hi> that is, from the place of miserie, the Dungeon, the prison, to a place of glory and happinesse. They are <hi>tooke away</hi> from the <hi>house of clay,</hi> to the <hi>house Eternall, not made with hands, in the heavens:</hi> they are <hi>translated</hi> upward, that is meant in this.</p>
                  <p>So that there are two observations in this.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That Pietie and Mercie excuseth not from death.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Godlinesse it selfe freeth not a man from death. Death it is that end that is propounded to all men. The bodies of godly men are of the same mould and temper, of the same frame and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution as other men, their flesh is as fraile, their humours as cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke, their spirit as fading, their breath as vanishing, they owe the same debt to nature, to sinne, to God, to themselves and their owne happinesse. They are bound under the weight of the same Law, the statute law is; <hi>It is appointed to all men to die once.</hi> It is well said, <hi>to die once,</hi> for the impenitent man dieth twice, he dieth here by the separation of his soule from his body, that is the first death; and there is the second death that succeedeth that; the death of the soule, by a separation of it from God, which is far worse. But <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and mercifull men die once;</hi> the first death seizeth upon them: <hi>It is appointed to all: It is the end of all flesh;</hi> in one place: <hi>It is the end of all the earth,</hi> in another place: It is the end of all living, the end of all men, even <hi>mercifull</hi> and <hi>godly men</hi> are brought within the compasse of this law of Nature, to yeeld up this debt &amp; due. Righteousnesse excuses not, it frees not. It is a law that bindeth one as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As <hi>Basil</hi> of <hi>Seuleucia</hi> observeth, though <hi>Adam</hi> was the first that sinned, yet <hi>Abel</hi> was the first that died: <hi>Adam</hi> committed the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, the elder sonne was <hi>Cain,</hi> the second <hi>Abel,</hi> in the course of nature the eldest should have gone first, but <hi>Abel,</hi> righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> that was the moytie, the halfe of his comfort, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14764:88"/>
halfe, though the younger: <hi>Adam</hi> sinneth first, and yet righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Abel</hi> dieth first. Hee gives the reason to be this, because God would let us see in the Portall of death, the table of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he would shew us the linnaments of the Resurrection in the first man that dieth, that <hi>righteous Abel is tooke away,</hi> that we should be assured that he was but <hi>translated,</hi> there was hope of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection confirmed even in his death. But yet that is not all; the reason (I conceive) that is more proper to this is: righteous <hi>Abel</hi> dieth first, to shew that even <hi>righteous and mercifull men</hi> must not expect immunitie from death, and from suffering tribulation in this world; it is the condition that befalleth <hi>Abel</hi> the righteous, as well as <hi>Cain</hi> the Pharisee; It belongeth to <hi>faithfull Abraham,</hi> as well as to <hi>Apostatizing Demas:</hi> to <hi>beloved Iacob,</hi> as well as to <hi>rejected Esau:</hi> to <hi>meeke Moses,</hi> as well as to <hi>cursing Shemei:</hi> to <hi>Deborah</hi> the <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse,</hi> as well as to <hi>usurping Athaliah:</hi> to devout <hi>Iosiah,</hi> as well as to <hi>impious Ahab:</hi> to <hi>tender-hearted David,</hi> as well as to <hi>churlish Nabal;</hi> to the <hi>humble</hi> Publican, as well as to the <hi>vaunting</hi> Pharisee. It is the law and rule that is set to all, there is no exemption: righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, pietie, and workes of mercie, then doe not exempt.</p>
                  <p>For if they could exempt, how should pietie have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? when should godlinesse come to the full recompence? It is Death that makes way to the hope of reward.</p>
                  <p>And if it be so, that righteousnesse excuseth not, then neither honour, nor strength, nor beautie, nor riches, can excuse in the world: for these are of farre lesse prevalencie with God then pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. So the Argument standeth strongly, if <hi>Iob</hi> died that was a <hi>mercifull</hi> man; if <hi>Abel</hi> was taken away that was a <hi>righteous</hi> man, looke to other conditions: then <hi>Caesar,</hi> that is, the Princes of the world shall be cut off, their state and pompe shall not keepe them: then <hi>Cressus,</hi> that is the rich men of the world, shall die, their purse and plentie, shall not excuse them: then <hi>Socrates,</hi> that is, the prudent and learned men of the world, their wisdome shall not prevent it: then <hi>Helena,</hi> that is, the Minnions of the world, the decking of their bodies, and their beauty, and painting shall bee fetched off, they will expose them to death, they shall not free them: then <hi>Sampson,</hi> that is, the strong men of the world, those that are healthy, of able parts, likely to out-live nature, their strength shall not excuse them: that no man should glorie in any thing without, <hi>Neither the strong man in his strength, nor the wise man in his wisedome, or the rich man in his wealth, but if hee glory in any thing, to glory in the Lord.</hi> Though wee must not boast our selves of pietie, yet as the Apostle saith, <hi>yee have compelled mee.</hi> If a man may boast of any thing, it is of pietie, that is, rejoyce in this if God have made a man a vessell of mercie, and an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of doing any good: but otherwise to boast of it, even that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:14764:89"/>
shall be the staine, and further disgrace of it: for <hi>righteousnesse it selfe excuses not from death;</hi> all are subject to the same law, that is the first observation, <hi>Mercifull men are taken away</hi> as well as others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a difference in the manner, though they bee subject to death, yet it is a subjection under another subjection: Death is made subject to them, they conquer Death. So both stand together, they die, and not die, because their death is but a translation, but a removing.</p>
                  <p>There are two persons, two men in every penitent and godly man; there is somewhat of a righteous man, and somewhat of a sinner; somewhat of the flesh, and somewhat of the spirit: so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these two, both lawes are kept: the Law of commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is kept, <hi>thou shalt die the death;</hi> there is the reward of sinne; the law of promise, that is kept, <hi>thou shalt live for ever;</hi> there is the reward of righteousnesse. Mortalitie giveth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to sinne, immortalitie to pietie.</p>
                  <p>Though they die, <hi>they are but taken away.</hi> The word implies these two things;</p>
                  <p>First, it implies that their death is but a temporarie death. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away is not a finall translation, it doth not implie a nullitie. Death, though it cut the knot of nature, yet not of grace. It is true, there is the sharpe Axe of Death, there is no knot so <hi>Gordian,</hi> but it will cut it asunder. It is a great knot that was first knit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the body and the soule, it cutteth that asunder. It is a sure knot, which is the Conjugal knot between man and wife, it cutteth that asunder. There is a naturall bond and union betweene Parents and children, it cuts that asunder. There is a civill union betweene friend and friend, it cuts that knot asunder, it takes one friend from another. But there is the misticall union betweene the head and the members, betweene Christ and the Church, it cannot cut that knot asunder. But looke as Christs body in the Grave, it was not deprived of the Hypostaticall union, so likewise the body of a Saint, when it lies in the grave, in corruption, it is <hi>mellowing</hi> for immortalitie, and eternitie: yea, then it enjoyeth the benefit of the misticall Union, there is somewhat of a member of Christ that lies in the grave: that dust that the body of a Saint is resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into, it is <hi>holy Dust,</hi> because that misticall Union is not cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder; Death cutteth not that knot. It perfecteth the misticall Union in respect of the soule, and it is but an interruption of the manifestation of the union in respect of the body, it is never se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. As the Husbandman hath some corne in his ground, and some in his Barne: the Corne in his ground is of no lesse value and account, then that in his house and Barne; Nay, it is of more, for that that is in his Barne shall not multiply, so many bushels he
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14764:89"/>
putteth up, and so many hee receiveth, but that which is in the ground multiples, therefore it is in as great account. So it is with God. There are many bodies of the Saints walking on the earth; and those that are laid in the grave, that <hi>are sowen</hi> (as the Apostle saith) <hi>for immortalitie.</hi> The bodies of the Saints in the grave, are of no lesse account with God, then those which walke up and downe in the world, and glorifie him with workes of pietie: why? the body is sowne to immortalitie, there is still somewhat of Christ. That is the first thing it implies; <hi>They are taken away,</hi> it argues <hi>that their death is temporary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it sheweth it is <hi>deliberate,</hi> that their death is not sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. For there is a difference betweene these two, to be snatched away, and to be <hi>taken away.</hi> Impenitent men when they are <hi>taken away</hi> in judgement, they are snatched away in displeasure. The godly man, God takes him away, removes him, it is as gentle a word as could be used, there cannot be a better word to expresse it in our translation, then for God <hi>to take him away. Iob</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> expressed it so, and so <hi>Isaiah</hi> here, to shew that Death is never sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the <hi>mercifull and righteous man,</hi> why? because he is alwaies prepared. It may bee sudden in respect of others, but not to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. The stroke of Death may be the same to a <hi>righteous man,</hi> as to an impenitent man, they may both fall by the prevalencie of the same disease, the same duration of sicknesse, the same warning given them, the same sympathy; but there is a difference in regard of the suddennesse.</p>
                  <p>If it be a sudden stroke that overtakes an impenitent man, then it is two wayes sudden; even a premeditated death is sudden to him, because he is not prepared: sudden death commeth not to a prepared man, because he lookes for it: it may (as I said) be sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to others, but it is not to himselfe, why.? because he expects Death, he <hi>dieth daily,</hi> hee dieth in his thoughts, before hee dies in act, he dies in meditation, before he dies in passion: <hi>I die daily,</hi> saith the Apostle, Death when it came to the Apostle, it found him dying, it could not come suddenly to him; Death findes him set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting open the dores: therefore though it seeme sudden death, it cannot be sudden, because he is <hi>taken away:</hi> the stroke of Death may be sudden, but the issue of death is not sudden: the stroke may be sudden to his body, but not to his mind; because he fitteth himselfe still for it. There is the deliberation implied in the word, his death is not sudden, in that he is prepared: God awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his heart to make him looke for it, therefore when Death commeth though sooner or later, it doth but take him, it snatcheth him not away, that is the meaning of the second.</p>
                  <p>The third word is, the extent of this act, <hi>from the evill to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. Of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: from the evill to come.</note> 
                     <hi>come:</hi> that is a word that is not specified in the former part: it
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14764:90"/>
makes both this and that the more full: it makes a greater demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Gods goodnesse: hee is not only mercifull in <hi>taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> but he <hi>takes away</hi> from that that is <hi>evill,</hi> hee takes from a bad estate to a better. An evill that is present, that is simply so: an Evill for the time to come, God takes righteous and mercifull men from both.</p>
                  <p>That I may lay a fit path for my proceeding in it, Saint <hi>Austin</hi> devideth the nature of Evill well to those two heads: there is the Evill of doing, and the evill of suffering, that is, the evill of sinne and of punishment. The first of these, the <hi>Evill of sinne,</hi> is opposite (saith <hi>Aquinas)</hi> to the increated good. The second, the Evill of punishment, is opposite to the created good. God takes away mercifull men from both these.</p>
                  <p>First, from the Evill of suffering. Two wayes he is tooke from <note place="margin">1. From the evill of suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> that. Hee is tooke away from the <hi>Evill of suffering,</hi> that hee shall not see it, and that he shall not undergoe it, and endure it.</p>
                  <p>First, that he <hi>shall not see it,</hi> that he shall not bee a spectatour: <note place="margin">That he shall not see it.</note> that is one part of <hi>taking away.</hi> For <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>mercifull</hi> men have tender affections, and yearning bowels, when they see Gods judgements extended over any place or person, they sympathize with them, they <hi>weepe with those that weepe, and mourne with those that mourne.</hi> God takes them from this sorrow and mourning.</p>
                  <p>It hath alwayes beene accounted one part of the happinesse of a godly man, to be taken from the Evils of the place he liveth in. God <hi>takes Iosiah from the evill to come.</hi> Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> sheweth it well in <hi>Nepotian,</hi> he makes this as an Argument amongst others, that his departure was a comfort and happinesse to him, because (saith he) <hi>Nepotian is happy that hee sees not those Evils, and calamities, and miseries that are now come on the Church that wee see.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, not only in the esteeme of godly, and righteous, and Christian men, but in the esteeme of the Heathens it was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a happinesse to die before a man see the miseries on the place he wisheth well to. <hi>Virgill</hi> in the eleventh of his Aeniads, bringeth in <hi>Vandall,</hi> making a lamentation over his sonne <hi>Pallas</hi> that was slaine; after many teares that were shed over him, and dolefull words that were past: the Poet bringeth in his wife, and saith, it was her happinesse to die before him, that she saw not this mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: the Poet accounted her happy that she died before, and saw not the miserie that was brought on that place, and her husband. In his esteeme then it is one point of happinesse, <hi>to bee taken away before that Evill come upon a place wee wish well too.</hi> Hee expresseth himselfe in another place, in the first of his Aeniads, <hi>They are happy that die before their Countrey,</hi> before they see the ruine of that. Therefore it must needs be a great happinesse for a Christian to be <hi>taken away</hi> before miserie come upon the Church. Here is one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14764:90"/>
the Lord hath, he takes them away that they doe not see the Evill he bringeth on a place.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; That <hi>they should not suffer it,</hi> that is a further degree <note place="margin">That he shall not endue it.</note> and a greater. So we see that it is the happinesse that is intailed on other servants of God; Though it is not a course that God alwayes constantly keepeth: sometime he suffereth godly men to live, and to be swept away in common calamities, as the Plague, Famine, Sword, and the like, even <hi>righteous men perish</hi> in these times, that is the course that God sometimes takes. On the other side sometime he takes this course, that hee will preserve them in the middest of danger, he will keepe them alive: he sendeth cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and plagues, and yet he preserveth the righteous. So in the Revelation, he commandeth the Angel to <hi>seale his servants on the forehead,</hi> when he poureth his curses on the Earth: so in the ninth of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> he speakes to the man with the slaughter weapon, to <note place="margin">Ezek. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>marke those that mourned,</hi> to passe them by: So in the 12. <hi>Exod.</hi> hee commandeth <hi>the bloud to bee sprinkled on the posts of the dores, that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>the Angel may passe by:</hi> So God when hee seeth his marke the bloud of the Covenant on the head of his servants, hee passeth them by in common calamities: sometimes I say hee takes that course. But he is not tyed to one course alwayes: sometimes, hee <hi>takes away</hi> his servants <hi>from the Evill to come,</hi> hee doth not suffer them to have the sorrow of seeing, or feeling of it.</p>
                  <p>God when he intendeth to smite the Earth with plagues and curses, he will make this way for his course, he will remove the obstacles, the Saints that are the impediments; they hold Gods hands, they wrestle by prayer, they prevaile by humiliation, they cast downe themselve, and stand in the gap: that he may unwind his hands of this burthen, of the prayers of his servants, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth them by death, hee saith to them as he did to <hi>Moses, let mee alone that I may destroy them.</hi> And then, as it is with the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, when the corne is gotten into his Barne, he burneth up the stuble: till the Wheate be gathered, the Tares are not turned up. God will not poure his plagues untill he have remoued the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, those that are <hi>mercifull men,</hi> when they are <hi>taken away,</hi> he powreth downe his judgements. Therefore he <hi>takes them away,</hi> that they may not see it, nor suffer it, that is the first.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he takes them from the Evill of sinning, that is a <note place="margin">2. From the evill of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. That he shall not see sinne committed by others</note> greater blessing, and in two senses from that. He takes them from it, that they shall not see sinne, for that is a great Corrasive to a godly man. It was one point of <hi>Davids</hi> grievance, that hee saw wicked men suffer; <hi>I humbled my soule with fasting, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved my selfe as one that mourned for his Mother. David</hi> humbled himselfe even for his enemies, when they were afflicted, that was one part of his sorrow. But the chiefe part of his sorrow was to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14764:91"/>
see them commit sinne, <hi>Mine eyes gush out with rivers of teares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men keepe not thy law;</hi> That was a great affliction. Therefore that they may be eased of that evill, <hi>God takes away mercifull men, that they shall not see sinnes committed;</hi> they are offensive to chaste eyes. Hee takes them to heaven, that their eares may not bee fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with hellish blasphemies, and damnable oathes that overbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the ground, that ring their peales in every street, as a man passeth by: there is no hearing such things in heaven. That is one thing, he takes them away, that their eyes may not be glutted with beholding extortions, oppressions, murthers, contentions, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and other sinnes in the world. It is a great ease to a godly man to be tooke out of evill times: when God leaveth him in times and places that are evill, hee shines as a light: when God takes him away, he hath the reward of his sorrow: it cost him griefe to see it, therefore to reward him, <hi>God takes him away, that hee may not see sinne committed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, God takes them away, that they may not sinne <note place="margin">That he shall not commit sin himselfe.</note> themselves: for heaven is a place as of no sorrow, so of no sinne: though we be unsatiable of sinne now, then there is an end put to it. It pleaseth God so to deale, in his providence to order it, that sinne brought in Death, and Death carrieth out sinne: that as a skilfull Chimmicke distilleth an Antidote out of poyson, so doth God, Death that was the reward of sinne, God fetcheth the translation out of it to eternall happinesse: the Mother, sinne, brought forth Death, and Death the daughter carrieth out sinne. That is it that is the great comfort of a man in death: as now I shal cease suffering, so here is my comfort too, I shall cease sinning: though my purposes and endeavours be bent upon piety, yet I am overtaken; I could not tread so straite, but I did often tread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wry; now there shall be a new plaine path provided for my feet, there is no sinne in heaven.</p>
                  <p>That is a great point of wisedome, that God destroyeth sinne with the body, and raiseth the body againe without sinne: if the body should live alwayes, how should sinne end? sinne will not be rooted out, as long as wee are in the body; while wee carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us this <hi>vale of flesh,</hi> we shall carry about us also another <hi>vaile of sinne:</hi> therefore saith <hi>Epiphanius, God dealeth with us, as a skilfull housholder with his house.</hi> Looke as it is in building an old house, if there grow a Fig-tree, or Ivy out of the house, that it spread the root through the chinckes and partitions of the wall, a man that cuts downe the Fig-tree shall not profit, for it is so fast rooted in the wall, and in the chinkes, that either hee must pull downe the wall, or else it will not die; Therefore a wise man will pull down his house, and root out the Fig-tree, and then set up stones, and and there erect the house beautifull, and so both are preserved: he
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:14764:91"/>
hath his end in both, both the house is rebuilt, and the Ivy consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and rooted out. So it is in case of sinne, there is the house we carry about us, the building, the temple of our body, the house is man himselfe, sinne is the fig-tree, it is such a fig-tree as insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth it selfe betweene every chinke, and partition in our nature; there is somewhat corrupt in every facultie of the soule, and it sheweth the fruit in every part of the body, that is an instrument of sin: it hath so wound it selfe in, that the fig-tree cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, cannot be pulled out, except the house be dissolved, there must be a pulling downe of the Temple: therefore God in wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by Death he takes the temple, the house in peeces, and then the fig-tree may be pulled out; and then he erects the wall of that house more glorious then before it was throwne downe, while the fig-tree was in it, while sinne was in it: it is raised up without it; that is that the Apostle saith, <hi>Corruption shall put on incorruption, and mortalitie shall put on immortalitie, the body that is sowne a naturall body, it shall bee raised a spirituall, it is sowne in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, it shall be raised in glory.</hi> God therefore <hi>takes them away from the evill of sinne,</hi> hee dissolveth the body, that hee may purifie it, and cloath it with immortalitie, that it may be a purer body, then when it was first presented in nature at the first Creation.</p>
                  <p>We see hereby what those good things are that Death bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; It bringeth immunitie from the evill of suffering: God <hi>takes away mercifull men,</hi> that they see not, that they suffer not. And it bringeth immunitie from sinne, that they doe not see it, that they doe not commit it.</p>
                  <p>The use is a Pillar of confidence, not to bee afraid of Death: <note place="margin">Vse.</note> who would feare that which makes for his perfection, that is the meanes of his translation to happinesse?</p>
                  <p>And in respect of others, not to mourne for them that are tooke away out of this world, as those that are without hope: they are not <hi>tooke away</hi> but <hi>translated:</hi> they are removed for their advantage, for the better. <hi>Elijah</hi> was removed from earth to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>in a firie chariot,</hi> shall <hi>Elisha</hi> weepe because hee enjoyeth him not? No, he is tooke from earth to heaven. <hi>Ioseph</hi> was sold into Aegypt, but it was to be a Ruler, God intended that: it is the same reason, God translates us out of the world, to give us <hi>the end of our hope, even the salvation of our soules;</hi> Shall we mourne as men without hope? God takes them out of a <hi>valley of teares,</hi> shall we mourne unsatiably for those that are tooke out of the <hi>valley of teares?</hi> let us not bring their memory to the <hi>valley of teares;</hi> they are past it. God takes them from evill to good, to the best good, the good of immortalitie, and eternitie, the good of the enjoying of God, <hi>of that that eye hath not seene, nor eare hath heard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, that when we see any impenitent man die, any man
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14764:92"/>
die in his sinnes, there is just cause of mourning. That was the course that <hi>David</hi> observed: he lost two sonnes, <hi>Absolom</hi> a wicked sonne, he mourned for him; he lost the child that was begotten in adulterie, for the life of which he prayed; he mourned not for the childes departure: and Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> giveth the reason well, he had a good hope and assurance that the child was translated to a better estate: he doubted of <hi>Absolom,</hi> he died in his sinnes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he mourned for him, for his death, not for the childes. So when we see any die in his sinnes, there is cause then of teares, and of excessive teares: then <hi>David</hi> crieth, <hi>Absolom, oh my sonne, my sonne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if there be good evidences of a Saint translated to glory, shall we <hi>mourne as men without hope?</hi> As Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> speakes to <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> mourning for her daughter; <hi>Art thou angrie Paula, because I have made thy child mine?</hi> (Hee bringeth in God speaking thus) <hi>dost thou envie me my owne possession? my owne creature?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, for the state of an impenitent man, he hath his good things here, and his evill to come after, there is cause of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for that he is translated from good to ill; his heaven is in this world, his heaven is in his treasure, in his riches, in his chests, and upon his table; and as he enjoyed a heaven here, so hee must not looke for it after, there is a place of another condition, his heaven is here, his hell after.</p>
                  <p>But the penitent and contrite, his ill is here, and his good after, his hell is in this world in suffering, and in mortifying the flesh, in wrestling with sinne, in incountring with tentations, here is his hell, and his torments, but after commeth his heaven, and his blisse, so he is translated from bad to good, he is tooke away from the evill to come.</p>
                  <p>So here is the meaning of all. I have shewed first the meaning of the three phrases.</p>
                  <p>The second thing I propound is this; What the Prophet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaneth, <note place="margin">Quest.</note> and makes lamentation for, and these <hi>mercifull men:</hi> for if they be <hi>tooke away</hi> from evill present, and evill to come, evill corporall and spirituall, sufferings extraordinary, plague and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; sufferings ordinary, sicknesse and tentation, if it be so that no sinne shall fall upon them to destruction, no tentation fall on them to destroy them here, much lesse afterward; if they be <hi>tooke</hi> from all these evils, how commeth the Prophet to make lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>mercifull men are taken away from the evill to come?</hi> for hee speakes it mourningly.</p>
                  <p>It is one sufficient reason, he mourneth over them because o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">Answ.</note> did not.</p>
                  <p>But there are two reasons that are more speciall. There is the losse of the godly man for the present <hi>when hee is taken away,</hi> that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14764:92"/>
is a thing to be lamented; And the danger of the world, in respect of the losse of a godly man.</p>
                  <p>First, the losse of a godly man, that is a great punishment that <note place="margin">The losse of a godly man, a great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to a place.</note> God sendeth on a place, there is a great losse to those that survive. The losse of their example: they shine as lights, there is a Taper, a Candle taken away; <hi>Yee rejoyced to walke in his light,</hi> saith Christ, to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> concerning <hi>Iohn,</hi> there was a light not only of <hi>Iohns</hi> Doctrine, but of his example, whereby those that heard him wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. There is the light of grace set up in the life of the Saints of God: they are as a Taper to guide us in the paths of mercy and pietie that they tread in. <hi>Iob</hi> was set up a <hi>light of patience: Abraham</hi> of <hi>faith: Cornelius</hi> of <hi>Charitie:</hi> and so every grace that the Saints are eminent in, they are set up as so many lights. When the light is gone, is there not a great losse to have a candle put out? Though they enjoy their light, we lose it, the benefit of their example and societie, their advise and counsell. Oh the experience of the Saints, bring a great deale of good to their acquaintance: I am in this affliction, I remember that you were in the same case, how did you carry your selfe? It is a great matter to build upon the experiences of the Saints of God.</p>
                  <p>Wee lose many benefits by losing of a Saint. Hee is not only beneficiall in his example, but in his prayers. Hee is one of the <hi>Advocates of the world,</hi> that pleads with God, that <hi>stands in the gap. Abraham</hi> was a strong <hi>Advocate</hi> for <hi>Sodome,</hi> and so was <hi>Moses</hi> for <hi>Israel,</hi> and so was <hi>Aaron,</hi> and so other Saints in their time. The Saints while they live in the world, there is a great deale of power in their prayers to with-hold judgements: and is there then no losse when they are taken away?</p>
                  <p>When a Saint is removed, a Pillar is removed, a Pillar of the house, and of the Earth, and must there not be danger when the Pillar is gone. They are the <hi>Corner stones:</hi> when a Corner stone falleth, there is a great deale of trash and rubbish falleth with it.</p>
                  <p>There is a great deale of discomfort upon the fall of a Saint. When God removeth godly and <hi>mercifull men,</hi> there is a losse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way: to the Church, to the State. The Church loseth a member, the State a Pillar: godly men lose an example, wicked men lose an Advocate, poore men lose a Patron, all men lose a comfort.</p>
                  <p>That is the first thing the Prophet bemoaneth in the losse of <hi>righteous men.</hi> First, it went to his heart that the world should be left emptie of pietie, and all those vertuous examples, that God should cut off those precious Plants, those that are looking-glasses for us to see our selves in, and that pitch of perfection wee should breath after, and aime at. That is the first thing.</p>
                  <p>But that is not all: for there was impendant danger when they
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14764:93"/>
were gone. It is a prognosticating of some evill to befall a place, when God takes them away. If <hi>Noah</hi> enter into the Arke, the world may expect a deluge. If <hi>Lot</hi> be out of <hi>Sodome,</hi> let it looke for a showre of fire and brimstone: God himselfe expresseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by the Angel that <hi>he could doe nothing</hi> as long as <hi>Lot</hi> was in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> he had a commission not to raine fire and brimstone while <hi>Lot</hi> was there, while <hi>Lots</hi> person and prayers were there: assoone as <hi>Lot</hi> was gone, there commeth a cloud of Judgement, and in that a showre. So the Saints when they are translated into the Arke; when they are tooke from the earth as <hi>Noah</hi> was, <hi>(Noah</hi> was to ascend from the earth to the Arke) when <hi>Lot</hi> is gone to the Citie God provided for him, the Citie of refuge, then we may expect one Judgement or other, for they are meanes to hinder, and keepe them from being poured out.</p>
                  <p>That is the second thing in the losse of righteous men. They are tooke away for their good, but for our ill: wee have lost the benefit of their example, the comfort of their societie, and now we may feare that Judgements will come plentifully: <hi>for mercifull men are taken away from the evill to come.</hi> So I have done with the first part of the Complaint.</p>
                  <p>I will be very briefe in the second: that is, over the living, <hi>no</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The second part of the Text.</note> 
                     <hi>man considereth it:</hi> this is truly to be bemoaned. There is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble extent, first of the Act, <hi>they consider not;</hi> And then an extent of the person, <hi>no man considereth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Act, hath a great latitude. It is either an aggravation of the former, <hi>they lay it not to heart,</hi> nay, <hi>they doe not take it into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</hi> or else it is a rendring a reason of the former; <hi>they lay it not to heart, because they bethinke not themselves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Consideration is an act of the judiciall part of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as incogitancie is a rocking of reason asleepe, a shutting of the dore of reason. Neglect, that is a negligence of due care to bee taken: on the other side, inconsideration or incogitancie that is a neglect of the due course of reason, due pondering of a thing. A man is said not to consider, that scanneth not, that examineth not the cause, that laies not the effects and consequences together, that compareth not one thing with another. So that it is thus much now, <hi>they considered not;</hi> that is, they pondered not in their hearts, they examined not according to the rule of reason; they looked not to it what should bee Gods meaning in <hi>taking away mercifull men from the evill to come;</hi> they looked not forward to the time to come, nor backward to the time past, they were altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate.</p>
                  <p>It is a great sinne, and a fruit of sinne, and a cause of all sinne. <note place="margin">Inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a great sinne.</note> It is a sinne in it selfe, for God hath given man Reason to use upon all occasions, to consider Gods workes, and his owne workes, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:14764:93"/>
those things that befall others and himselfe. The true improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christianitie is the exercise of consideration, That ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth a man to repentance. <hi>David</hi> laies it as a ground, <hi>I conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my wayes, and turned my feet to thy testimonies.</hi> A man never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth that considereth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>is wayes. The want of consideration keepeth a man freezing, and settling on the dregs of sinne.</p>
                  <p>It is a fruit of sinne, of the first sinne: incogitancie bringeth se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, that rocks reason asleepe; then passion hath her scope, <note place="margin">A fruit of sin.</note> when reason governeth not. It is the true punishment of the first sinne, and the fruit of it, because reason is decaied in man by sinne, reason was then unrectified, reason grew irregular.</p>
                  <p>Nay, it is the cause of all sinne. We can resolve no particular sinne to any other principle but this, that men consider not before <note place="margin">A cause of sinne.</note> they commit it. The reason why men goe on in excesse and riot, and continue in drunkennesse, is nothing but this, <hi>they lay it not to heart,</hi> they looke not forward, what will bee the issue and event, they consider not the account they are to make to God, they thinke not that God is providing a <hi>cuppe of deadly wine,</hi> and that <hi>all must appeare before the judgement seate of Christ.</hi> The reason why mens desires of the world, and of living here are so in larged, it is the want of consideration of what is the happinesse of heaven, of the promises that God hath made. There is no sin but it is resolved into this case. So here it is, that the Prophet complaineth of the want of consideration, <hi>When mercifull men were taken away, they considered it not;</hi> to sympathize, to prepare themselves to what God would doe after he had removed these, that when he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the obstacles, that then he would poure his wrath upon them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is another extent of the Word; that is, of the subject, of the person. No man. It argueth the neglect to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. A man would have thought, that upon the mention of the first word, <hi>Mercifull men are taken away: the mourners should goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in the streets;</hi> the poore Orphans should weepe, because they have lost a Patron: No such matter, no consideration on no hand: that is a wonder: had the <hi>mercifull man</hi> no wife? no children? no friend to mourne after him, when he was buried in the earth? was there no well-willers to him, that had benefit by his pietie to mourne for the <hi>righteous man?</hi> was there none like to himselfe? one <hi>righteous man</hi> will mourne for another. What is this then, <hi>No man?</hi> If they would not regard the pietie of the <hi>godly man</hi> or <hi>mercifull,</hi> when he lived, me thinkes when hee died there should be some consideration. A Mountaine as long as it standeth, men take no great notice of it: but if fall, all eyes looke upon it. The Sunne when he is in his strength, there are few eyes that looke on it; but if it come to an ecclipse, every man getteth into his Turret.

Generally men delight to looke upon those Starres, that in their opinion they thinke are fallen. All these the godly man is. Hee shineth as a starre here, as the Sunne in his strength after, he is as a Mountaine, as a Beacon upon a Mountaine, more glorious. The Mountaine, and the starre falleth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Sunne is in the Ecclipse, <hi>Mercifull men are taken away, and no man considereth it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will not say it is to be taken in the full extent, it implieth not a nullitie, but a paucitie. As in that place in the Psalme; <hi>There is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> The Prophet doth not implie, that there was not one godly man at all, but so few that they could hardly be numbred; a great paucitie. So here, <hi>No man considereth;</hi> that is, those that considered, were so very few, that there was hardly notice taken of them, they were hardly in the compasse of a Number.</p>
                  <p>Nay, it is twice noted, <hi>No man, no man,</hi> to shew it was almost a nullitie; there is not any, not any; that is, they were exceeding few.</p>
                  <p>What is the reason? Because they were not acquainted with the rule, and way of pietie, therefore they mourned not. If pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie were within, it would simpathize without, as there is like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, so they would sorrow together.</p>
                  <p>Wee are not to thinke, but they had naturall affection, though it were almost cut off: it is likely if any of their kinne were tooke away, they would mourne: If a Father or Mother were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the most impenitent man would have teares; though not for sin, yet for losses and crosses: then there are those that would crie with <hi>Elisha, My father, my father, the Chariots of Israel,</hi> &amp;c. If a brother or a sister were taken away, I doubt not but there are those that would follow with the voyce of lamentation, <hi>Alas my brother, alas my sister, woe is mee for my brother Ionathan.</hi> Wee have teares for brethren. Further, if it were but a child that were lost, a man would be sure to find teares for them, and sigh a long time after, and would say with <hi>David; Oh Absalom, my son, my son, would God I had died for thee my son.</hi> All conditions that live find teares in mens eyes, and consideration of their departure, only the <hi>godly,</hi> and the <hi>righteous man</hi> findeth none.</p>
                  <p>Here is their stupiditie. Can there be a greater stupiditie, then to make a man die twice? as they die the death of their bodies, so to make them suffer a death in our memories; as they perish to the world, so to perish also in our thoughts and meditations. We owe God so much, we owe pietie so much, we owe the memoriall of many so much, we owe our selves so much, as to take it into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration. And yet no man considereth.</p>
                  <p>This is the fault which we may examine our selves of. For if we now make reflection of all this upon our selves, we shall find a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14764:94"/>
conformitie with out times. There is never a word of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but it is true now. I will not take the parts in order.</p>
                  <p>First, wee cannot denie that evill is to come upon this place. Nay, it were well if it were to come: it is come already: it hath overtaken us. If we load the earth with the evill of sinne, it is impossible that God should forbeare long. The evill of sinne that surchargeth the earth must be unloaden againe, by this burthen, by the burthen of punishment: one burthen must justle out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Evils there have beene impendant, that we have seene. Evils there are now present, that we begin to groane under: and no man can tell where that evill will stay. There is evill present, and evils to come, because our evils are still multiplying: the beginnings of sorrowes, and sufferings, and feares; God grant it may stay. But our state and condition is like them in this, that they are yet impendant. We see the heavens growne blacke, judgements are a ripening. When yee see the skie red, when yee see the skie blacke, judgement is beginning, not only beginning to bud, but it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to spread and inlarge it selfe. Thus farre there is a correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie. There is evill that we have cause to feare and suspect, yet further to come on this place.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a conformitie with the other too, in our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. The world sendeth forth men now <hi>voide of naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> It was never so before. For if before they neglected others, yet they were carefull of themselves. But men now desperatly neglect their owne salvations. There is no respect to God, no pitty of others, no not of themselves.</p>
                  <p>I doe not wonder that men heretofore considered not, when they loved their lives better then their sinnes, because they had some sensible taste of that that was temporall, when they loved their lives better then heaven. But now men love not their lives best, but their sinnes better: for though their lives bee in danger, yet their sins are kept.</p>
                  <p>It is an admirable thing to consider, how every way we are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to plentie, to ryot, to securitie, notwithstanding God commeth neere, and bringeth his judgement even to the dore, and makes it swell. He forbeareth a long time, to trie us with mercies, and then he takes a severe course. Where shal men see the face of an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? our lives are the same, our delights the same, our vanities and follies the same; we keepe the same sins still, as if we were bent to provoke God further, to see what he will doe.</p>
                  <p>That is an evident signe we consider not for what purpose God sendeth his plagues, we consider not what he doth, when he takes away others for our example; none lay it to heart, and take it into consideration, it swimmeth not in his braine. We begin to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and we thinke our selves well, if we provide a countrey house:
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14764:95"/>
but God hath beset us in the Countrey, and in the Citie. There will be no flight but to repentance, there is the Citie of refuge: and there is no way to repent but by consideration: these must be tooke to heart before there can be amendment, and till there be amendment, there will be no removing of judgement. It is plaine then that we are conformable in that part of the Text.</p>
                  <p>And in the first too. That <hi>mercifull men are taken away,</hi> experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sheweth it daily: they are taken so frequently, that there is hardly any left: they are not only <hi>taken away,</hi> but swept away. And if there were no other proofe, this representation, this sad spectacle before our eyes, that is an argument to make the proofe of the conformitie of the first part of the text with us.</p>
                  <p>In the text, there is mention made of a righteous man, of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull man. The Spirit of God bringeth in all the parts by paires. It is fulfilled in the solemnitie, and occasion of this day: by paires God calleth us to pietie, by paires he giveth us spectacles of mortalitie.</p>
                  <p>I thought I had come to doe the dutie for one, to performe the solemnitie of one Funerall: but after, I perceived I was called to doe the office for two. It was not so from the beginning, it falleth not out so every day. Here is the true proofe that these are the times of mortalitie: set the paires any way, and wee shall see that there is none free, none can secure himselfe from the stroke of death. One, a vertuous ancient Gentlewoman: the other, a grave learned Minister, but of younger condition: here are both ages tooke away, and both presented: not only so, but here are both conditions of life, and both presented together; and here are both sexes, and both presented together, to teach us, that no sexe, no condition, no age can secure themselves. I will smite the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard (saith Christ, foretelling the Disciples what should befall them.) Here is the smiting of the Shepheard, and the sheepe too: Put both together, and I beleeve this place cannot send such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paire.</p>
                  <p>For the one, Hee was the most eminent for his place; For the other, shee was the most eminent for her pietie. I was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the conversation of either, and therefore I shall not speake much: and the information I had, it was not much, for it was needlesse: I may save a labour for both: for if I speake any thing false, yee are able to refu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e me; if I speake any thing true (as all must be true that is spoken here) yet yee are able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent me, and I can say nothing that yee know not.</p>
                  <p>For the one; I heare that he had the report of a man that was conscionable in the discharge of his place. And all that I shall say of him shall be only this; there is cause that yee should take to heart his death. For what is the reason that in this little Parish,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14764:95"/>
that is as healthfull as another. (But God is wonderfull in his wayes, and we must not search into the judgements of God) that it is not full eight yeares, but there have three succeeded, that have beene commended to this place, and have died one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Is it so that yee kill them with unkindnesse? the world saith so I tell yee. I know not, but this I am sure of, that there have beene too many unkind passages: where the fault is, your selves know. But this is to be taken into consideration, that God remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them from yee, as if yee were worthy of none. If God send us these helpes and Lampes that waste themselves to shine to us, and to breake and dispense to us the bread of life, shall we not give them incouragement in their studies, that they may goe on quietly and peaceably? A word is enough for that. Howsoever some of yee would not suffer him to rest, God hath taken him to his rest. There is more might bee said, but I will not say too much.</p>
                  <p>For the other, since I came from my house, I had information. At my first footing in the Parish, they said shee was as good a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as lived. At my first footing in the house, they said shee was a very good woman. Those that have lived in the Parish, they testifie, that she was a woman most eminent for her pietie and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Shall shee want a memoriall? I asked of those that have knowne her of old, they say, shee was a righteous woman for the righteousnesse of pietie, and a mercifull woman for the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of mercie. Shee had respect to both tables, to her dutie to God, to her Neighbour. For the mercie of charitie, she was good to the poore: shee was a lender to those that were in necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and a giver too. For the mercie of pittie, she was very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate to those that were in afflictions, she sympathized with them, visited them, and comforted them. For the mercie of peace, in time of contention, she laboured to set all straite, she had a soft answer to pacifie wrath. Shee was a mercifull woman, and God hath given her the reward, hath tooke her to his rest. She was a lover of peace, he hath taken her to the place of peace. She was one that studied happinesse, and hee hath taken her to a place of happinesse. He hath tooke her from these evils that we are reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to, and that we may feare.</p>
                  <p>That is the difference betweene a godly and an impenitent man. Impenitent men, if they be tooke away, they are taken to further evill, if they bee left alive, they are left to further evill. Mercifull men, if they be tooke away, they are taken away for the eschewing of evill: and if they be left on the earth, it is for the diverting of evill. They divert them while they live, and shunne them when they die. As they labour to honour God in their lives, so God gratifieth them in their death, he takes them to himselfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:14764:96"/>
This consideration, and occasion, is a proofe of the Text. As it is proved in all the Text, let us disprove it in our selves, that this word may never goe in the course it lieth here, but in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary course. That righteous men perish, and men doe lay it to heart (let it be said so) and mercifull men, though they be tooke away, yet there are those that take it into consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. I have done with the last part, and with the occasion.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the which you have five things;</p>

                  <p>I begin with the first.</p>

                     <hi>Blessednesse,</hi> is a thing that every man desireth. Hee is no man, but a monster, that would live wretchedly. Every man desireth to be <hi>blessed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that thing which wee all desire in common, when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be determined, most men mistake it. Some place <hi>blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> in riches. And some place it in honours. Some place it in pleasures. And some place it in health of body. And some place it in civill vertues. What need I tell you more? S. <hi>Austin</hi> in his <note place="margin">Aust. lib. 19. de Civit. Dei.</note> 19. booke <hi>DeCivitate Dei,</hi> telleth us of no fewer then two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fourescore and eight severall places of <hi>blessednesse.</hi> All deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in this life.</p>
                  <p>To let them passe. <hi>Blessednesse consisteth in the enjoying of the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne good. That same soveraigne good is God.</hi> Wee enjoy God both in this life, and in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>From hence there is a double <hi>Blessednesse.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A double blessednesse.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Distinguish them as you will; Whether you call one <hi>Beatudo viae,</hi> the other <hi>Beatudo patriae,</hi> as some doe. The <hi>Blessednesse of the way,</hi> and the <hi>Blessednesse of the Countrey.</hi> Or whether you call one <hi>Beatudo spei;</hi> the other <hi>Beatudo rei.</hi> The <hi>Blessednesse of expectation, or the blessednesse of fruition.</hi> Or whether you call them (as usually you doe,) The <hi>Blessednesse of Grace</hi> here, and <hi>the Blessednesse of Glory</hi> hereafter; It mattereth not in what termes you distinguish them, but so we know this, have one, and you are sure of both. There is none have the <hi>Blessednesse of Glory,</hi> but such as were first <hi>Blessed in the state of Grace.</hi> And there is none <hi>Blessed in a state of Grace,</hi> but shall be <hi>Blessed in the state of Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a threefold condition of a <hi>Blessed soule.</hi> It is here <hi>in the bodie,</hi> (as long as God pleaseth) But then <hi>it is from the Lord.</hi>

                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:14764:99"/>
It is <hi>with the Lord,</hi> but then it is <hi>from the Bodie.</hi> There is a third Condition, when it shall be <hi>in the body</hi> againe, and <hi>with the Lord for ever.</hi> Then is the full consumation of blisse, when this same body of ours shall bee raised up, <hi>and made like the glorious body of</hi>

                     <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But our <hi>Blessednesse</hi> in this life, though we have here a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table fellowship with God, yet, because that it is not <hi>per speciem,</hi> it is not by sight, it is but by faith, <hi>wee walke by faith and not by sight.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 7</note> Because while <hi>wee are here</hi> (though wee doe <hi>see the face of God</hi> in the Mirrour or glasse of the Gospell, yet because) wee <hi>are absent from him,</hi> as he is <hi>objectum Beatificans.</hi> Because here <hi>the teares are not all wiped from our eyes,</hi> and we have not yet a <hi>full rest from our labours,</hi> nor a full <hi>reward</hi> for our services. Therefore our <hi>Bessednesse</hi> here it is nothing (to speake of) in comparison of that <hi>Blessednesse</hi> which we shall have hereafter, when the soule is separated from the body, and is <hi>with the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>Therefore (saith the Apostle) <hi>I desire to be dissolved, and to bee</hi>

                     <hi>men,</hi> beleevers, the children of God, <hi>were most miserable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the hope of our immortall life, is the life of this mortall.</p>
                  <p>There was some little glimpse of this light, even amongst the Gentiles, (such as did beleeve the immortalitie of the soule.) One of the heathen Poets could say, <hi>No man is blessed till death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cressus</hi> the Lybian (a man happy in his great achievements) asked <hi>Solon; Pray</hi> (quoth he) <hi>tell mee, what man dost thou thinke hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie?</hi> Hee named one to him, <hi>(Tellus)</hi> a man that was dead. <hi>But</hi> (quoth he) <hi>whom else dost thou thinke happy?</hi> Hee named two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren more, that did a worke of pietie to their Mother (it were too long to tell you the particular storie) and they were dead, <hi>I thinke them happy,</hi> quoth he. <hi>Cressus</hi> began to bee angrie, that hee himselfe should not be thought a happy man. Am not I happy? <hi>Oh</hi> (quoth he) <hi>I take thee for a great king, but I account thee not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py before death. Cressus</hi> grew to miserie, and then he cried out, <hi>Oh Solon, Solon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Here we have a word, <hi>a voyce from heaven:</hi> and the Word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Spirit: and we have testimonies of Scripture: and we have some little glimpse of this light from the Gentiles: yet notwithstanding, flesh and bloud will not be perswaded of this, <hi>that dead men should be happy,</hi> that there is a happinesse in <hi>death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are many things they have against it. First, say they, <hi>Death is an enemie.</hi> It is very true, <hi>Death is an enemie,</hi> the Apostle calleth it so. <hi>The last enemie that shall be destroyed is Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:14764:99"/>
And, say they, <hi>it is a terrible enemie.</hi> It is very true, and <hi>of all ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things the most terrible:</hi> yea, and nature abhorreth it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. See it in any creature that liveth: Marke if every creature would not use legges, wings, hoofes, hornes, tuskes, beakes, or whatsoever thing it is wherewith God and nature hath armed it, to preserve life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> saith it (but he saith it in the person of a carnall man, as he doth many things by Metaphors in his booke of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes.) <hi>That a living dogge, is better then a dead lyon.</hi>

                  <p>Yea, and not only wicked men, doe make many base shifts to live <hi>(they have their portion in this life;</hi> no wonder therefore they doe it) but even Gods best children, that looke for a better life then this, when this is ended, are not willing to part with this life if they could keepe it: Doe you not remember how <hi>David</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for life; <hi>Oh let me live, that I may praise thy Name: oh spare mee</hi>

                  <p>Why doe we all this while goe from my Text? Surely there be so many voyces upon earth against it, that if there were not a <hi>voyce from heaven</hi> to say, <hi>Blessed are the dead, that die in the Lord,</hi> we should scarce beleeve it.</p>
                  <p>But then if the dead be blessed, why doe wee not die, that wee <note place="margin">Quest.</note> may be blessed?</p>
                  <p>There is such a like Question of <hi>Scipio</hi> in that same booke of <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                     <hi>Tullies, Somnium Scipionis. Scipio</hi> asked his Father, when his father had told him of those glories that the soule enjoyed in immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: <hi>Why</hi> (saith he) <hi>doe I tarry thus long upon the earth? why doe not I hasten to die?</hi> The schollers of <hi>Eugesius,</hi> when they heard their Master dispute of the immortalitie of the soule, went and laid vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands upon themselves, that they might go to that immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And so <hi>Cato Vticensis</hi> after he read <hi>Platoes</hi> books of the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie of the Soule; made away himselfe. Many such examples there have beene. And I find often-times in your bills many that have laid violent hands upon themselves, some that cut their owne throats, and some that hung themselves. I pray give me leave a little to speake upon this.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Austin</hi> tells me of five causes, for which persons doe usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally lay violent hands upon themselves.</p>
                  <p>The first is this. Some doe it to avoide some shame, or some <note place="margin">Five causes of selfe-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> dishonour, or miserie, or beggerie, that shall befall them. Thus did <hi>Achitophel,</hi> when he saw that his counsell was defeated, hee went home and hanged himselfe: Thus have many done to avoide <note place="margin">1</note> shame and dishonour. Alas poore wretches; While they seeke to escape temporall punishment, they runne into eternall, like our fishes in the Proverbe, <hi>Out of the frying-pan into the fire: into hell fire, where the worme dieth not, and where the fire never go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, some have done it to avoide the terrours of a guiltie <note place="margin">2</note> conscience. Thus <hi>Iudas,</hi> troubled in conscience, after hee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed Christ, he went and hung himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Poore wretch; He had more need he had lived, that hee might have healed that sinne of his by repentance. This is not a way to expiate thy sinne, this is a way to increase it. <hi>Iudas</hi> when he killed himselfe, hee killed as wicked a man as was upon the earth, and yet hee shall answer to God, as well for that nocent bloud of his
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:14764:100"/>
owne that he spilt, as hee shall for the innocent bloud of the Son of God that he betrayed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wee find some that have done this to avoide some vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie that they feared should bee offered them. As for example. <note place="margin">3</note> 
                     <hi>Pelagia</hi> a noble Ladie, that we reade of in Ecclesiasticall stories, when shee was followed by some barbarous souldiours, that would have abused her, she speaking nothing but, <hi>never a villaine of them all shall touch me;</hi> threw her selfe over a bridge, and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her selfe.</p>
                  <p>Some of the Fathers doe little lesse then commend her for this. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> condemnes her, so should I. For, why should she that had done no hurt, doe hurt to her selfe? why should she to escape the hands of the Nocent, lay violent hands upon her selfe that was innocent? Our chastitie of body is not lost, when the chastitie of our mind remaineth inviolated.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly; Some have done this to purchase to themselves a <note place="margin">4</note> name of valour. <hi>Rasis</hi> in the booke of the Machabees did thus. And if there were no other thing in the world to shew that booke to be Apochriphall Scripture, this is enough, in that the Author of that booke commendeth <hi>Rasis</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p>It is not valour for to flie a danger: it is valour to beare it. If any example can bee alledged to this purpose, that of <hi>Sampsons</hi> may. But Saint <hi>Austin</hi> hee answereth. The Spirit of God secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded him to doe it. And wee may verily beleeve it: for if the Spirit of God had not commanded it, yea, and assisted him in it too, hee had never done that he did, in pulling downe the house upon himselfe and the Philistims.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, some have done it, or they might have done it, because <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Blessed are the dead.</hi> Some will die, that they may be blessed.</p>
                  <p>Poore wretches; They that deprive themselves of this life, may not looke for a better when this is ended. I will not judge particulars, I leave them unto God. But in the generall, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that life is Gods blessing: it is hee that giveth it, and it is hee that must take it away. Considering that man is not lord of his owne spirit. Considering that God hath set us here in our stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and we may not move out without leave from our Generall. Considering that we are set here to serve God, and we must serve him as long as he will, and not as long as wee will. Or specially considering that God hath forbidden us to kill others, therefore forbidden us much more to kill our selves: therefore surely (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Gods mercie bee greater then I can give warrant for) they that die thus, die eternally. And wee had need beseech God with all earnestnesse of spirit, to keepe us from such a fearfull temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as this: for they that die thus, <hi>die not in the Lord,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot bee <hi>blessed:</hi> for my Text saith it of no other, but of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:14764:101"/>
those, <hi>Blessed are the dead, that die in the Lord.</hi> This is the first point.</p>
                  <p>I come to the Restriction.
<q>Die in the Lord.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be construed two wayes, the preposition is Ambiguous: <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 2. What it is to die in the Lord. Rom. 16. 1.</note> for the Preposition many times in Scripture signifies <hi>In Domino,</hi> or <hi>propter Dominum.</hi> As <hi>Rom. 26. 1. I commend unto you Phebe our sister, that you would receive her, in Domino, in the Lord;</hi> that is, for the Lords sake, <hi>as becommeth Saints.</hi> And in the twelfth verse of the same Chapter, <hi>Salute the beloved Persis which laboured much in the Lord;</hi> that is, <hi>laboured much in Gods cause, for the Lord.</hi> So againe, <hi>Say to Archippus, looke to the ministerie that thou hast received In Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino;</hi> that is, <hi>for the Lord,</hi> for the Lords service, for his worke. I might give you many more instances. There is one place most pregnant, <hi>Eph. 4. 1. I Paul a prisoner in Domino;</hi> so saith the vulgar Latine, and so is the Greeke interpretation, <hi>In the Lord.</hi> What meaneth Saint <hi>Paul? A prisoner in the Lord,</hi> what is that? <hi>A pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner for the Lord, a prisoner for the Lords cause.</hi> And thus you may take the word here in the Text, <hi>Blessed are they that die, In Domino;</hi> that is, such as <hi>die in causa Domini:</hi> and thus <hi>Iudicious Beza,</hi> (to whose judgement I attribute much in translations) hee readeth it so, <hi>Blessed are the dead, qui moriuntur causa Domini:</hi> and then in his Annotations, <hi>propter Dominum.</hi> And if you take it thus, then the Martyrs only are blessed. That Martyrs are blessed, the Church of God is so farre from making a question, that they set it downe as a Rule, <hi>Injuriam facit Martyri qui orat pro Martyre; A man doth wrong to a Martyr, that prayes for a Martyr,</hi> their blessednesse is so sure: for, <hi>Hee that loseth his life for my sake, and the Gospels, shall find it,</hi> saith Christ. If he loseth a temporall life, he shall find an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. If he lose a life accompanied with sorrow, hee shall find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother life that is with joy, such joy as cannot bee conceived, such joy as shall never be ended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two things (saith S. <hi>Bernard)</hi> that makes the <hi>death of a Saint precious:</hi> the one is a good life before; the other is a good cause for which he dieth. A good life will make it <hi>a precious death:</hi> but a good cause will make it a more <hi>precious death.</hi> But that is the most <hi>precious death,</hi> that hath both a good life before it, and a good cause comming next.</p>
                  <p>The Martyrs are blessed, but they must be such Martyrs as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the Lord, be sure of that, or else they are not blessed. There be some that would be accounted Martyrs (a great company of such we have had of late) that have died for broaching of treason,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:14764:101"/>
and some for sowing of sedition; some for absolving subjects from the oath of Alleageance, some for attempting to blow up Parliament houses. Such as these are not Martyrs. <hi>It is not the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, it is the cause that makes the Martyr.</hi> Our blessed Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that never did evill was crucified betweene two evill doers; there was an equall punishment, there was not an equall cause. It must be the cause that wee must looke to, if wee looke to be blessed.</p>
                  <p>But I cannot stand upon that. Here is the first interpretation: <hi>To die in the Lord, is for the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there is a second, and that is more large, <hi>Die in the Lord,</hi> that is, die in the faith of the Lord. <hi>Salute Andronicus, and Iunius my fellow prisoners, which were in the Lord before mee,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul;</hi> that is, that were Beleevers, that were in the faith before mee. And (to let passe many other places) <hi>if there bee no resurrection of the dead</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>then wee that are asleepe in Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Thes. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>wee beleeve that Iesus died, then those that sleepe in Iesus shall hee bring with him,</hi> &amp;c. And againe, <hi>Hee shall descend from heaven with a shout, and they that are dead in Christ shall rise first.</hi> Now what is it to die in Christ in a large sense?</p>
                  <p>I will tell you. Hee that would die in Christ, first hee must <hi>die in obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are many workes of obedience, that wee are to doe. <note place="margin">1. To die in obedience.</note> Our last and greatest act of obedience, is to resigne up this same spirit of ours willingly, chearfully into the hands of God that gave it.</p>
                  <p>If wee have not attained to that strength, that some have done; that is, to live patiently, and die willingly, yet wee should labour to attaine to thus much strength, to live willingly, and to die pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently; <hi>So as Christ may bee magnified in my body</hi> (saith the Apostle) <note place="margin">Phil. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>I passe not,</hi> it makes no matter, <hi>let it either bee by life or by death.</hi> When wee have done the worke that God hath set us to doe, wee must be gone: and thus must every one say with himselfe; <hi>Lord, if I have done all the worke thou hast appointed mee to doe, call me away at thy pleasure.</hi> Here is the first. In obedience.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. <hi>Die in repentance.</hi> I remember what <hi>Possidonius</hi> said <note place="margin">2. In repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> a little before his death, that it was necessarie that men when they died, they should not goe out of the world, <hi>abs<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> digna &amp; competenti resipiscentiâ, without a fit competent repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Hee himselfe did so, for he caused the penitentiall Psalmes to be written, and they were before him, as hee lay upon his bed, and hee was continually reading those penetentiall Psalmes, and meditating upon them with many teares: he died even in the very act of contrition.</p>
                  <p>I doe love to see a man chearefull upon his death-bed: but I
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:14764:102"/>
doe more love to see a man penitent. There is a day indeed, <hi>when God will wipe away all teares from our eyes;</hi> When that commeth, then he will wipe away these teares of repentance too, these teares of godly sorrow: <hi>But the Lord grant he may find mee with teaees in mine eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly; <hi>Die in faith.</hi> Indeed if ever Faith had a worke to <note place="margin">3. In faith.</note> doe, it hath then a worke to doe, when all other comforts in the world faile us, and friends goe from us; then faith, to lay hold on the promises; <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that I shall rise againe at the last day, and bee covered with my skin, and shall see God with these same eyes.</hi> Thus faith.</p>
                  <p>And then fourthly. <hi>Die with Invocation,</hi> calling upon the name <note place="margin">4. With prayer.</note> of God. Thus have all the Saints of God done, continually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending of their soules to God in prayers. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would have us <hi>commend our soules to God in well-doing.</hi> And it is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary thing every morning wee rise, and every night wee goe to bed, but especially when wee see some harbingers of death sent unto us, then to have nothing to doe, but with our blessed Lord; <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.</hi> And with Saint <hi>Steven,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 23. 46. Act. 7. 59.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord Iesus receive my spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And next to this, let me put in also, <hi>Mercie, Charitie:</hi> Die <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5. In charity.</note> 
                     <hi>one another.</hi> Thus our Lord taught us to doe, when he cried out, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they doe.</hi> And Saint <note place="margin">Euke 23. 34. Acts 7. 60.</note> 
                     <hi>Steven</hi> taught us to doe so too; <hi>Lord lay not this sinne to their charge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then lastly, (for I cannot stand upon these things) there <note place="margin">6. In peace.</note> must be a <hi>death in Peace.</hi> Peace with God: Peace with our owne consciences, and Peace with all the world.</p>
                  <p>And now the man that dieth thus; dieth with <hi>willingnesse:</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in <hi>repentance;</hi> dieth in <hi>faith,</hi> dieth with <hi>invocation,</hi> dieth in <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,</hi> dieth in <hi>peace,</hi> this man <hi>dieth in the Lord,</hi> and such a one is <hi>blessed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They that would thus die in him, must live in him.</hi> A man cannot <note place="margin">How to come to die in the Lord.</note> bee said to die in <hi>London,</hi> that never lived in <hi>London.</hi> A man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said to <hi>die in the Lord,</hi> that never lived in the Lord. If thou dost not live in <hi>obedience,</hi> in <hi>faith,</hi> in <hi>repentance,</hi> in <hi>invocation,</hi> in <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1</note> 
                     <hi>in peace,</hi> thou canst not die in these. A man must first live the life of the righteous, before he can <hi>die the death of the righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then againe, if a man would die thus, <hi>Hee must bee well acquainted with death:</hi> grow familiar with him by meditation. <note place="margin">2</note> Many things more I might have said to this purpose, but I am loth to transgresse the houre. I have done with that.</p>
                  <p>Give me only leave now to speake in a few words unto the present occasion.</p>
                  <p>You have brought here (beloved) the body of your well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14764:102"/>
neighbour, Mistris <hi>S. H.</hi> late the Wife of your late reverend Pastour Doctor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>R. H.</hi> to be layed up together with her Husband, in hope of a blessed and glorious resurrection. It is long since that I did in this place performe this service at the buriall of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Wife, a woman of whom I may not speake, for though I hold my peace, the very stone here in the wall will say enough of her: and you that know her, cannot but assure the truth of it.</p>
                  <p>I am intreated to performe now, the like duty to the second Wife. And I was easily intreated to doe it: for that name of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and sister, that was usually betweene us for many yeares continued, may very well challenge of me, any dutie I am able to performe. I am straitned in time, and I cannot speake what I would: and I doe perceive alreadie by this that I have spoken, that if I should speake much more, my passion would not give me leave. Let me tell you one thing amongst many others, it is a thing extraordinary, and it is for imitation. The <hi>Vertuous woman</hi> in the last of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> is commended for many things; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others this is one, <hi>Shee doeth her husband good, and not evill, all the dayes of her life.</hi> And marke it I pray you: <hi>It is not all the dayes of his life,</hi> and yet peradventure some woman might bee thought a good woman, that doth that, but shee may perhaps out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live her Husband. <hi>A vertuous woman will doe him good, and not evill all the dayes of her life:</hi> And for this amongst many other things, I doe commend this vertuous Gentlewoman. I may almost say with the words there in the end of that Chapter; <hi>Many daughters have done excellently, but thou surmountest them all.</hi> So I may say, many women peradventure have done excellently in this kind, but I doe not know of any one that ever hath done the like to her Husband. I pray you heare it.</p>
                  <p>Her Husband had a brother that lived in <hi>Portugall</hi> at the time of his death, who was there married, he had there three children at least, two sonnes and a daughter. This vertuous good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would give her selfe no rest, till she had these children out of <hi>Portugall:</hi> shee got the two sonnes hither. And what was her care? (here is another excellencie of hers) her chiefe care was for their soules. What did shee? or rather what did shee not, to winne those children from Poperie (in which they have beene brought up) and to bring them to the true service of God? Shee obtained it, she got it.</p>
                  <p>When shee had done that, wonne them to our religion, she had not done all: one of these had a desire to exercise some Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise by Sea. Shee furnished him to the Sea, shee furnished him with money for his adventures. The other shee bound Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise here in the Citie to an honest trade: and shee hath given them a liberall childes portion, I may say so. A childes portion, that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14764:103"/>
they may thanke God (and I hope they wil have the grace to do it) that they had, I do not say such an Aunt in law, but such a Mother.</p>
                  <p>Here was not all. Shee sent for the Mother too; shee was but sister-in-law to her Husband: she sent for the Mother, she sent for the Daughter: they were here. Shee clothed them; she fed them some moneths: and if shee could have wonne them to our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, she would have maintained the Mother while shee had lived: shee would have brought up the Daughter, as her owne child: But that could not be done, it was a worke beyond her strength.</p>
                  <p>You see here a vertuous Woman, that did good to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, not all the dayes of his life, but all the dayes of her life: To the very last day of her life, shee never did cease to doe good to her Husband in his kindred: and I thinke I may say, that shee was more carefull of his kindred, then of her owne. But this is not all. This kindnesse you will say was shewed to her Husbands kindred. Heare a little more therefore.</p>
                  <p>Shee knew that there were many Ministers that had a great charge of children, and peradventure would be very glad to have some of their children taken off of their hands. Shee hath given to the putting out of five Ministers children, to bind them Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices, fiftie pounds.</p>
                  <p>Shee knew that there were some poore persons of the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> here, which stood in necessitie; Shee hath given to the reliefe of them, twentie pounds.</p>
                  <p>Shee knew that there were many poore soules, that lay in Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish slavery. Shee hath given for the redeeming of them, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie pounds.</p>
                  <p>Nay, yet more; Shee considered, that her Husband was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time a poore scholler in the Universitie of <hi>Cambridge.</hi> And shee considered too, that, there are many Ministers Widowes that lived well, while their husband lived, that are faine to crave reliefe (the greater is the shame of some men) when they are dead. Shee hath therefore given five hundred pounds to purchase lands, and with this land to maintaine, partly two Schollers in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie, from their first comming thither, till they bee Masters of Art. And then with the residue to maintaine foure Widowes, that have beene the Wives of honest preaching Ministers. <hi>Zacheus,</hi> his offer was, but halfe of his goods. <hi>Lord, halfe of my goods I give to the poore.</hi> For ought I can perceive and understand, above halfe of her estate shee hath given to charitable uses. I say no more of her. <hi>These workes of her will praise her in the gates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Shee died in the Countrey. And I am sorry that I had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation (as I did desire) of her behaviour in her sicknesse. I have it not: I can say nothing of it: but thus much. It was not possible, that such a creature, that lived thus (as we know she did)
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14764:103"/>
in <hi>obedience</hi> to God, in <hi>repentance,</hi> in <hi>faith,</hi> with <hi>invocation</hi> of Gods mercie, in <hi>Charity,</hi> in <hi>Peace,</hi> but that her death was blessed. Shee that lived in the Lord, no question but she died in the Lord, and shee is blessed; for <hi>Blessed are the dead, that die in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God Lord teach us to number our dayes, that wee may apply our hearts to wisedome;</hi> and grant that as we grow in yeares, we may grow in knowledge of thy truth, in obedience to thy will, in faith in thy promises, in love toward thee, and toward our neighbours for thy sake, that when wee come to the end of our dayes, wee may come to <hi>the end of our hope, the salvation of our soules;</hi> through Jesus Christ: to whom with thee oh Father, and thee oh holy Spirit, three Persons, but one true and immortall, and onely wise God, be given, both from us, and all thy creatures in heaven and in earth, continuall praise, honour, glory, dominion and power, now and for evermore.</p>
                  <p>Let all those that heare the word of God depart from iniquitie. <hi>Now the God of Peace, that brought againe from the dead our Lord Iesus; the great Shepheard of the sheepe, through the bloud of the everlasting Covenant, make you perfect to doe his will, working in you that which is pleasing in his sight, through Iesus Christ.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese words containe an Argument or reason which the Apostle useth, to <note place="margin">The summe of the words.</note> prove that the weake Christian should bee borne withall, and that men should not judge, because of the difference of meat amongst them. Hee sheweth that they did not with the neglect of the knowledge of any truth keepe themselves ignorant in this particular: but it was their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The strong should beare with the weake, and the weake should not censure the strong: the reason is, because they agree in one end: they propound one generall end to themselves, that guides them in all their actions, they walke in one way, and in one path, and therefore they should in these things agree together. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall end at which they all aymed in their doings is <hi>the Lord: Hee that eateth</hi> (saith he) <hi>eateth to the Lord, and he that eateth not, to the Lord hee eateth not;</hi> that is, still he propoundeth God as his end, and the pleasing of God in his actions, as the rule of them. That he may
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:14764:106"/>
prove this unto us, that they stand thus affected, both of them, notwithstanding this difference, he bringeth in this as the generall reason, whereto every particular of their lives may bee reduced: All their life is ordered by the Lord: <hi>they live to the Lord, they die to the Lord, so that whether they live or die, they are the Lords;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all their particular actions are to the Lord. <hi>Whether we live, wee live to the Lord, and whether we die, we die to the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this generall reason he propoundeth two wayes. First, Negatively, <hi>None of us liveth to himselfe, and no man dieth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Devision.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Affirmatively: which consisteth of two parts. Their dutie to God. Gods acceptance of them, and protection over them.</p>
                  <p>Their dutieto God, <hi>if we live, we live to the Lord, and if wee die, we die to the Load.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gods acceptance of them; <hi>Whether wee live or die wee are the Lords.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which we shall now insist upon, is the former part, the negative expression, and proposall of this generall reason; <hi>None of us liveth to himselfe, and no man dieth to himselfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, when the Apostle affirmeth this of the beleevers of those times, he therein intimateth thus much; that it is the course of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> None of us</note> in all times; It is a dutie belonging to all others, of which they must make account, not to live to themselves, but to the Lord. Therefore though he speakes generally here, yet there is in his speech a kind of particular universalitie: a generality with a restraint. He saith <hi>none of us:</hi> hee saith not none in the world <hi>live to themselves,</hi> for there are many in the world <hi>live to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and not to the Lord:</hi> but <hi>none of us:</hi> none of those that wee ranke our selves with, that are in the condition of beleevers: none of those concerning whom we speake in this question: <hi>none of us live to our selves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Life, in generall, is nothing else but that power whereby wee act or move. As we read <hi>Gen. 2. God breathed into man the breath</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">liveth</note> 
                     <hi>of life, and he became a living soule:</hi> he gave him the power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he acted. The acting of this power is the exercise of that life, whether the action be of the mind, or of the body. And so, as there is a double life, there are two sorts of actions of life: there are naturall actions of a naturall life, and there are spirituall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a spirituall life. When the Apostle speakes of living, hee intends both these. <hi>Wee live not;</hi> that is, we doe not the actions of life, whether naturall or spirituall, <hi>to our selves, but to the Lord. No man liveth to himselfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>himselfe,</hi> he meaneth not only a mans person, either soule or <note place="margin">to himselfe.</note> body: but all those advantages, that conduce, to the well-being
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:14764:106"/>
of a man. No man of us so ordereth the actions of his life, with reference and respect to our selves, as the uttermost end: wee doe not make our owne wel-beeing, or wel-fare, the uttermost end of our actions: <hi>None of us live to our selves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You have the sense and meaning of the words; which being a patterne to other Christians: a thing which the Apostle suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, is or should be in every beleever: it giveth us this point of instruction, whereupon we shall insist at this time. That is.</p>
                  <p>No beleever, none that are in Christ, should make themselves, the end, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> A beleever is not to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the end in his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> in their actions.</p>
                  <p>None should live; that is, spend their time and strength and endeavour, ayming at no higher end then themselves. No Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian should so spend his time, as to seeke himselfe only in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he doth; <hi>None of us liveth to himselfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here it may bee objected (for the clearing of the point) <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> May not a Christian seeke himselfe in the things that hee doth? When they doe good things, that which God commandeth, that they may avoide the punishment: when, being incouraged by the promise of a reward, they performe the actions of obedience, doe they not herein seeke themselves? They seeke the avoyding of evill to themselves, and the obtaining of good for themselves: and doing thus they live to themselves.</p>
                  <p>To this wee Answer. Wee must consider, our selves two <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> A double consideration of our selves.</note> wayes.</p>
                  <p>First, in subordination to God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in competition with him, or opposition against him.</p>
                  <p>Consider a mans selfe in subordination to God: so a man may <note place="margin">How a man may seeke himselfe.</note> seeke himselfe; that is, he may seeke his owne good: though not as the uttermost end, wherein his thoughts rest, yet hee hath this incouragement. <hi>Selfe-love is a plant of Gods owne planting</hi> in the heart <note place="margin">Selfe-love lawfull.</note> of man: and hee will not have any man root out that that he hath planted: <hi>Grace drieth not up the fountaine of nature:</hi> It doth but turne the streame into a new channell: it guides it the right way. When a man is renewed by grace, and sanctified, he is the same man in his faculties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he doth his actions better then he did before; and all that he did before, he doth them to a better end. It is impossible that the will of man should incline to any thing, but as he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it good, and good for mee: now there is no man can conceive a thing as good for him, but hee must conceive it as good and sutable to him, sutable to his welfare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. The law of God forbiddeth not this, but stablish it, and commendeth it, if it be rightly ordered. <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy soule, and with all thy strength, that is the chiefe:</hi> notwithstanding thou shalt not hate thy selfe: <hi>thou shalt love thy
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:14764:107"/>
nighbour as thy selfe:</hi> subordinate to the love of a mans selfe must be the love of his neighbour; and subordinate to his love of God, must be the love of himselfe. Thou maist love thy selfe, but in a degree inferiour to God. Thou must love thy selfe in God, and seeke thy good in God, and not in thy selfe: therefore it is that God in the Scripture hath set promises and threatnings one oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the other. Now it is lawfull for a man to bee drawne to obedience, or driven from sinne by any argument that God useth in his Word. When God threatneth punishment, shall not men be awakened? the Lyon roareth, and the beasts of the Forrest tremble. When God promiseth: here is the act of Faith to receive this promise, and to believe it.</p>
                  <p>Herein <hi>Iesus Christ the Author and finisher of our faith,</hi> is set as a patterne for us: <hi>hee set before him the joy.</hi> It is lawfull for a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an herein to imitate Christ: I speake this for their sakes, to allure them by incouragements from the Word: that howsoever the avoyding of sinne by threatnings is an action of selfe-love, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the love of God; yet these two may stand together in a due subordination one to another, a mans love to himselfe, and love to God: to love God more then himselfe, and so to seeke all good in God, and in the way leading to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, take man as he standeth in competition, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to God, in matter of will and desire. In this case a man must not loue and seeke himselfe, but God. When a man seekes good to himselfe in a way displeasing to God; herein he must not seeke himselfe; for he must live to God, and not to himselfe: when his thoughts and desires, and affections, are carried for himselfe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally; this is against the rule: this is not the state of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, of a beleever, thus to seeke himselfe in any thing contrary to God, or in any thing above him.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have the opening of it. And it shall appeare to be a truth by these reasons.</p>
                  <p>For a man <hi>to live to himselfe:</hi> that is, to doe the actions of life with respect to himselfe, not to others, and to God. It is <note place="margin">The Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation proved by reason.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, a dishonour to God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, injurious to Christ.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, dangerous and hurtfull to a mans selfe.</p>
                  <p>First (I say) it is dishonourable to God. It is the greatest disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. It is disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to God.</note> the creature can doe to the Creatour, to exalt himselfe, to make himselfe his end in the actions hee doth. It is to make a mans selfe a God, and to make God an Idoll. For what is that incommunicable <hi>glory that God will not give to another.</hi> but this, to make himselfe his end? It is a glory proper only to God. <hi>Hee made all things for himselfe, Prov.</hi> 16. 4. Marke how these two agree well together, that that, that is the efficient cause,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:14764:107"/>
should be the finall cause too: that as God is the maker, so hee should be the end of all things: and as that that giveth beeing to the creature it is out of it selfe, so likewise that that should quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and act the creature should bee out of it selfe. When a man therefore propounds himselfe as his end, he is said in that to make himselfe God. Those false Apostles, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20. it is said of them, that <hi>they made their belly their god;</hi> because this they propounded as their end, how they might advantage themselves in the world, how they might feed and delight themselves, and exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and serve not God. This is to bring God below a mans selfe, making God an Idoll, and himselfe God. I say therefore it is the highest dishonour that the creature can doe to God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is the greatest injurie that he can doe to Christ, to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. It is injurious to Christ. Phil. ver. 19.</note> live to himselfe. Christ may say truly, and more properly, and fitly to us, then Saint <hi>Paul</hi> could say to <hi>Philemon, Thou owest thy selfe to mee.</hi> Wee owe our selves to him by all rights, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by that great right of purchase: hee bought us to himselfe, he redeemed us to himselfe; <hi>You are bought with a price,</hi> (saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle) <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>therefore glorifie God in your spirits and bodies, for they are Gods.</hi> They are his, and not your owne, because he bought them, bought them when you were slaves, and had inthralled your selves, therefore you owe yourselves to him, hee hath purchased you to himselfe.</p>
                  <p>In the old Law, the rule was, that if a man had bought ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either out of captivitie, or the like, he was to demand all the worke and service, that this man could doe, all his time and strength belonged unto him that bought him, for he was his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, therefore he might exact of him the uttermost hee could doe for his service, for he bought him. Much more Christ, that hath bought us from a worse slaverie, from a slavery under the power of darknesse: and bought us with the greatest price, even with the effusion of his owne bloud: <hi>Hee hath redeemed us</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Peter)</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Per. 1. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>not with silver and gold, but with his owne precious bloud;</hi> a price farre above that, if a man should give all his wealth. Now when Christ hath bought us for himselfe, wee are become not his money, but his bloud; therefore all that we have, and are, is due to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are his. If we have any good in the world, in things present: if there be any good to the soule, in things to come, all is by Christ: therefore all must be unto him.</p>
                  <p>I a man have a servant, if he be either bound to him, suppose an Apprentise: or if he be hyred to him, suppose a workman or Artificer: if hee live by him, and have maintenance from him: every man expects that his time be to his Master, and his worke for his Masters advantage. If a day-labourer come at night and demand pay: the Master will aske him, what worke hee did?
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:14764:108"/>
suppose the man should tell him, he had beene building himselfe a cottage, or mending his owne apparell, or had beene doing such and such worke for himselfe: but what hast thou done for mee, saith the Master? Dost thou thinke to live by me, and not worke to me? Doe we thinke to live by Christ, and not serve Christ? This is the very end why <hi>hee hath delivered us from the hands of our</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 74.</note> 
                     <hi>enemies, that wee might serve him in holinesse and righteousnesse, all the dayes of our life:</hi> Marke it: wee must serve him, for he hath delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us; that is, we must doe him service: doe his worke, not some peece of the day, and the worke of another, another part of the day: doe somewhat with respect to God, and somewhat with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to our selves: but we must <hi>serve him all the dayes of our life.</hi> The whole time of the hyreling is for his Masters service, and the wholetime of a Christian, for the service of Christ: for hee hath bought us with the price of his owne bloud. Then it is an injury to the Lord Christ, because he hath ransommed us at such a price for himselfe, if we doe things to our selves, and not to him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as it is a dishonour to God, and injurious to Christ, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. It is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to a mans selfe.</note> that men should live to themselues: so it is dangerous to a mans felfe. And that will appeare by comparing what wee lose by it; with what we gaine by it. Compare our losse and our gaine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and wee shall see then, that wee doe our selves the greatest mischiefe, when we seeke our selves most.</p>
                  <p>Consider first what wee lose by it. Our happinesse. What is <note place="margin">1. A man in seeking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, loseth his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> the happinese of the creature, but the injoying of God? We lose our end, and perfection. What is the blessednesse of the creature, but to obtaine his end? What is the end of the creature, but the glory of the Creatour? Then the creature commeth to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and blessednesse, and happinesse, when it is most emptie of himselfe, when he most perfectly, and with due affection seekes God. Therefore in seeking our selves, we lose our happinesse. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> so conceived of their blessednesse: they let fall them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the highest point of selfe-love, when they stood in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with God, or opposition against God. <hi>Moses</hi> desired that <hi>his name might bee blotted out of the booke of life,</hi> rather then God shouldbe dishonoured. And saith the Apostle, <hi>I could bee content to bee separated from Christ, for my brethrens sake:</hi> that is, that Christ may be glorified. Hee knew that his happinesse lay not in injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a blessed estate to himselfe, free from care and trouble: but that herein his happinesse lay, that God may bee glorified, and that he might bring it to passe by any meanes, that he might serve God, in that end whereto God had appointed him: and the more perfectly he could attaine that end, the more perfectly he should attaine his happinesse. So it is with a true Christian, he is so farre blessed, and happy in heaven, as he is serviceable to God on earth,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:14764:108"/>
as he lives to him, and doth much, and suffereth much for him: when that life that he hath, is spent (in the severall actions, and turnings, and changings of it) in the service, and to the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I say consider this: you lose that which you seeke: you seeme to seeke happinesse to your selves, by seeking wealth, and pleasures, or earthly advantages to your selves; and while you seeke them, with a neglect of duty to God, with a neglect of the discharge of that worke and service, hee hath committed to you: you lose that happinesse that you seeme to seeke, and which you should seeke indeed, which is the perfection, the end of the creature: the service of his Creatour. So you see what we lose.</p>
                  <p>Consider secondly, what wee gaine. It may bee you gaine <note place="margin">2. That which he gaines, is but a shadow of gaine.</note> wealth for your selves: this is somewhat you will say. It may be you gaine honour, and esteeme in the World: you gaine a name amongst men, or some earthly advantage. Alas! what is this if it be rightly considered? It is but the gaine of a shadow, to the losse of the soule. If it be wealth: doth it satisfie the soule? Doth it quiet the conscience? Doth it fill a man so, as that hee needs no more? All the wealth in the world cannot doe this: there is an emptinesse in all these things: there is fulnesse to bee had only in God, in Christ, in spirituall things: nothing else is able to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the soule in all its desires, to give it perfect peace.</p>
                  <p>If the happinesse of a man were either in himselfe, or in any other creature, he need have nothing to doe with God, hee need not then to looke higher above himselfe. But God hath placed a vanitie both in men, and in all creatures: man is vaine, and all the creatures in the world <hi>are vanitie, and vexation of spirit.</hi> And when the Scripture calleth them vanitie, what doth it meane, but that they are emptie things? they have not that nourishment in them, that they seeme to have, they have not that in them, that they should have, according to that esteeme that men put upon them: they are emptie things: as we say of wells, when they want water, they are emptie, though they bee full of other things, as dust and sand, &amp;c. Or as clouds that have no moisture, and raine in them, they are emptie: so are all things in the world therfore emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, because they have not in them, that which the heart seekes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: they have not happinesse in them, they have not contentment in them. What is this then, but to forsake bread, and to seeke after huskes, like the Prodigall that left his Fathers house, where there was bread enough, and to feed on huskes with swine? to leave the aproach and accesse of the soule to God, wherein it may satisfie it selfe to the full, with that which is food indeed: and to seeke somewhat in the world that it cannot get. I say, this is a mans losse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:14764:109"/>
Nay, he loseth himselfe in living to himselfe: <hi>What shall it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. Hee loseth himselfe. Mat. 16. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>a man to winne the whole world, and lose himselfe?</hi> Mat. 16. 26. <hi>To lose his soule,</hi> saith one Evangelist, <hi>to lose himselfe</hi> saith another. A man loseth himselfe, when he loseth his soule. And this he doth in the neglect of God: hee loseth his soule in that action: when a man gathereth wealth by indirect meanes, or keepeth his wealth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and doth not disburse it in the service of God, for his glory, or what soever else a man doth; in gaining the world, hee loseth himselfe. <hi>Hee that will lose his life shall save it, and hee that will save</hi>

A man never loseth a shadow more, then when he followeth it: the faster hee pursues it, the faster still it runneth from him: such is the pursuit after any thing out of God: the more a man pursueth it, the more hee loseth himselfe, he is driven so many paces from heaven, so many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>rees from his owne happinesse. This is the folly and madnesse o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> the world, whereby Sathan deludeth men, leading them after vaine shewes of earthly delights, in carnall security, flattering themselves in the pursuit of the world, dreaming of happinesse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and in the conclusion imbrace nothing but a shadow and emptinesse. This I say is the misery of man. Now put both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: Consider what wee lose: that that is truly good, that that is blessednesse indeed: and what wee get: that that is but a shadow, that that is emptinesse indeed. Men lose that they seeme to have: and want that they pursue after. A secret judgement of God, because they sought not that, that they should doe. Thus we see the point opened, I hasten to the aplication.</p>
                  <p>The first use is, for Conviction, Since there is such a truth as <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. For Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> this, that <hi>no man</hi> that professeth himselfe to be in Christ, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth himselfe to be abeleever, <hi>should live to himselfe,</hi> that is, doe any action of his life, ayming at himselfe, as the uttermost end in those actions. It serveth in the first place to convince us, that professe our selves to be Christians, and beleevers, to bee such as know Christ (though with these differences, some are more weake, and some more strong;) yet I say, it convinceth every man to stand guilty before the Lord, that if hee live to himselfe, hee is none of Christs. This is the property of every true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, even of the weakest, as well as of the strongest (for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speakes of all, <hi>None of us,</hi> saith he, whether weake or strong Christians, <hi>live to our selves)</hi> if thou therefore live to thy selfe, thou art none of those the Apostle speakes to: thou art none of those <hi>that live and die to the Lord;</hi> thou art none of those <hi>that are the Lords, whether in life or death.</hi> Let us therefore first be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of this, that there is such a sinfull disposition in the hearts of men, that professe themselves to bee Christians, and yet live to themselves. That is the first thing I would convince you of at this time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:14764:109"/>
Secondly, I would shew you, that wheresoever this dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, it argueth a foule and sinfull heart. None of us doe so (saith the Apostle) other men that have no part in these priviledges and comforts, they doe so, they live to themselves.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wee will convince you of this life, that it is simply necessary. That so without delay, every one that is convince that he liveth to himselfe, may now begin to leave that course, to liue to himselfe, and hereafter live to God.</p>
                  <p>For the first of these. To convince us that there are many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst <note place="margin">1. That there are many that professe themselves Christians yet live to themselves.</note> us that professe our selves to be Christs, and yet are thus disposed, and have this sinfull affection, to <hi>live to our selves.</hi> Take this first in the generall. If there were not such a disposition in mens hearts, the holy Ghost would not thus have directed the spirit of the Apostle, in expressing this, as a note of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them and others, and as an argument that a strong Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, should beare with the weake, because <hi>they doe not live to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi> The Scripture giveth not rules in vaine.</p>
                  <p>But that yet we may see it more clearely: you shall find this <note place="margin">Complained of.</note> very thing complained of sometime: and sometime forbidden. Complained of, <hi>Phil. 2. 21. All seeke their owne, and not the things of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> Such a disposition there was in them, that they sought their owne, they lived to themselves. And forbidden. <note place="margin">Forbidden. 1 Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. 24.</note> 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 24. Let no man seeke his owne, but every one another mans wealth.</hi> A thing expresly, and in termes so clearely forbidden, as no man can hide himselfe from the light of it. Hee is certainly guiltie of the breach of this command, that seekes after his owne: that seekes himselfe.</p>
                  <p>But how shall wee know (that wee may bee more sensible of <note place="margin">How a man shall know whether he liveth to himselfe.</note> our owne case) whether it be thus with us, or not: whether wee live to our selves, and not unto God?</p>
                  <p>I will give you two generall rules and tryals whereby a man may discerne whether he live to himselfe or not. The first is this. <note place="margin">Rule <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> Consider when a lust, and an occasion meet together, how you are. I shall shew it in divers particulars. Take it thus.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes you shall see that a man is put on to a good dutie by <note place="margin">Iustance 1.</note> incouragement: sometimes hee wants those incouragements. Marke now, how a man determineth and resolveth, to act, or to cease his action, by vertue of these incouragements. Sometimes you shall see that there is a command to a dutie, but no outward incouragement to that duty, that may satisfie the desire of a mans heart in selfe-respects. He must obey God in this command, but hee shall gaine nothing in the world by it: hee shall neither grow rich, nor get more esteeme among men, or have a more easie or pleasant life in outward things: all selfe-respects faile in this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The question is, what a man resolveth upon in this? If now
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:14764:110"/>
his heart start aside from God, and fall off from the dutie, because he wants those incouragements that a man lookes after, a way for himselfe, fulnesse to himselfe: then it is evident, thou hast respect to thy selfe. <hi>Iehu</hi> all the while, that his zeale to God might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him, and the better settle himselfe in the kingdome of <hi>Israel;</hi> he can call others <hi>to come up and see his zeale for the Lord:</hi> but when his zeale had no such baite, and allurement to those actions, then <hi>Iehu</hi> turneth against God, and falleth to Idolatrie and other sins: <hi>Iehu</hi> is not now the man, when these incouragements faile, that he was before.</p>
                  <p>You have abundance in <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 10. seeking Christ, that still discovered a living to themselves in it. <hi>You seeke me</hi> (saith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our) <note place="margin">

                     <hi>because of the loaves:</hi> they had some outward advantage by him, and therefore so long they sought him.</p>
                  <p>So the Lord discovered them in <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. to bee such as lived to themselves even in holy duties: <hi>You crie unto me</hi> (saith God) <hi>but it is</hi>

That is <note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note> one case: Consider when things come thus, that sometime those worldly advantages fall off from a man in the profession and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of religion: if hee fall off from the dutie too, he is a man that liveth to himselfe. This was the case of the second and third grounds they <hi>received the seed with joy:</hi> that is, when they were sensible of comfort they followed Christ, but afterward when <hi>persecution arose for the Gospell, they fell off, and tooke offence.</hi> Such as these <hi>live to themselves:</hi> they seeme to live to God, but it is to themselves: and therefore when selfe-respects faile, they fall off too.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, take another instance for the clearing of it; Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that not only sensible advantages faile, but sensible disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages <note place="margin">Instance 2.</note> come in the world. A man is sensible that hee shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage himselfe much, if he goe on in the wayes of obedience to God. It may be if he make conscience of his wayes, hee must make restitution of his estate, unjustly gotten. Hee must deny himselfe in a greater measure of pleasures, that hee hath unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pursued. Hee must emptie himselfe, in workes of mercie, and pietie, of a great part of his estate, for the good of others, that God may be glorified by his substance. Hee shall lose some worldly friends; some esteeme among men. Here are sensible disadvantages to a man. Now the Question is, what he resolveth to doe? Here is the command of God; and here is (the thing whereupon the heart of man, and his affections are set upon) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages in the world. These come together. Here is an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:14764:110"/>
for a lust, a sinfull affection to expresse it selfe; If that bee laid in the ballance, and shall prevaile above the other: that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then I will endure disadvantage in the world, I will neglect the way of serving God: this partie liveth to himselfe: whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good he did before in matters of religion, all was done to himselfe. I say when these two come together: as you know when two men walke together, and one servant followeth them, <note place="margin">Simile.</note> a man knoweth not whose servant he is till they part: but then when they part, a stranger may know whose servant hee is: hee followeth his owne Master, and leaveth the other. So, when God and the world goe together, God and a mans owne advantages goe together: when there is nothing commanded, but standeth with his owne advantages: so long a mans deceitfull heart may flatter, and delude, and misguide him, hee may goe on in a false perswasion, and in a strong conceit that hee is in Christ, in a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed estate. But when these two part: that I shall not onely not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage my selfe, but sensibly disaduantage my selfe in outward things. Here now I say the Question is what a man doth. If I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to cleave to my outward advantages, and leave God, and leave the wayes of God: I live to my selfe.</p>
                  <p>A man that liveth to God, you shall see it is otherwise with him: as for instance, <hi>David:</hi> when hee might have had the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Israel somewhat sooner, by sinne, hee would not doe it: his heart smo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e him, for cutting off the lappe of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment: though he might have gained the kingdome of Israel by it, hee would not lay his hands on the Lords anointed: And what was the reason of it? because he would not advantage himselfe by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to God; he would rather want himselfe.</p>
                  <p>What was the reason that <hi>Daniel.</hi> when he saw hee was in an apparant hazard, not only of the losse of honour, but of his life, and that for the performance but of one dutie, prayer, and that but for a short time: yet would not omit it, no not for a short time, though he might by that not onely have saved his life, but kept his honour in the Court: he prayed to God, even at that time, when he was forbidden: Why so? because he lived to God, and not to himselfe. Had <hi>Daniel</hi> lived to, and sought himselfe more then God, he would have dispensed with this, and saved both his life and honour, though he had offended God in that particular of omission. But this is the disposition of a heart that is faithfull and upright with God: it will not dishonour God for the greatest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that can come to it selfe: it will not neglect a dutie to God, whatsoever losse it have in the world.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Take another instance, whereby we may see what <note place="margin">Instance 3.</note> we intend in this tryall. Let the will of God, and the bent of a mans owne will come in competition together. God will have
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:14764:111"/>
me leave this: I will hold it. God will have mee forsake this: I will keepe it; It is a comfort, a worldly benefit: I lose my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort if I part with it. He that now liveth to himselfe, hee will please his owne will, and be disquieted, and vexed against Gods will that crosseth his. But he that liueth to God, will bee content that God should crosse him in his will: because he would glorifie God in his owne will, in his soveraignty, in his puritie, in his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and justice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See it in the case of <hi>Abraham. Abraham</hi> had a strong love to <hi>Isaak,</hi> and good cause: yet neverthelesse though hee could see a comfort to himselfe in this sonne, when God telleth him, thou must <hi>sacrifice thy sonne Isaack,</hi> when he had the revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will of God: <hi>Abraham</hi> now resolveth to shew that he lived to God, and not to himselfe: therefore he would part with any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his life for God, when he required it. So <hi>David; If the Lord will</hi> (saith he) <hi>hee can bring me backe, that I shall see the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, and the Arke: if not: if he say I have no pleasure in thee, lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> here I am, let the Lord doe with me, as seemeth good in his owne eyes.</hi> When the case is this, when the will of God, crosseth thy will: what now prevaileth? Doth the desire of having thy owne will prevaile against the desire of submitting to Gods will? Doth it raise murmuring, and impatiencie of spirit? So farre thou livest to thy selfe. Therefore consider this. Here is an occasion now for a lust, and a sinfull affection to shew it selfe: either a man may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage himselfe in an evill course, or he cannot but disadvantage himselfe in a good course: or when God crosseth a man in that hee desireth, and delights in, in the world. That is the first tryall whereby a man may know whether he liveth to himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another tryall will be this; Consider if there be any <note place="margin">Rule 2.</note> part of the truth of God, of his revealed will, that for selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respects thou art willing to be ignorant of, lest the knowledge of it, should make thee doe somewhat to thy owne disadvantage: in this thou livest to thy selfe. See this to be true, in all that lived to themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Balaam,</hi> though he profest, that for a house full of gold, hee would not goe beyond the word of the Lord, yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was willing not to take notice of Gods will, but to goe on rather to curse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iohanan</hi> in <hi>Ier.</hi> 42. professeth deeply that he would obey the will of the Lord; but when he understood the will of the Lord, when it crost his will: then saith he to <hi>Ieremy; It is not the Lord that hath bid thee say this, but Baruch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When men cavill against any part of Gods word, or hide any truth from themselves, <hi>and with-hold the truth in unrighteousnesse;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> Here is a man living to himselfe. How many points are there in Religion, that many men are willingly ignorant of? And when
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:14764:111"/>
they cannot but know them, how doe they labour for distinction? how doe they dawbe over the matter, that they may hide the truth from themselves, that it may not worke upon their consciences, to make them leave their profitable sins? Some would have the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lords day according to Judaisme, though it bee revealed to them, that there is a broad difference between the <hi>Iews</hi> observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Christians keeping of it. Another man he will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Usurie to be a sinne, because his course is usurious: he will not know this willingly, because he would not disadvantage himselfe. Another will not understand what hee is bound to doe, to the glory of God with his estate: in what measure, according to all the good that God hath blessed him with, to honour God, and give the first fruits of all his increase: nor in what manner, that he should be ready to every good worke, to contribute willingly to the necessities of the Saints: what he should doe to pious and mercifull uses, what for publike, what for private occasions: he would not willingly know these things: he should have less ease he makes account. Thus when a man is not willing to bee informed in any thing, to sift the truth to the bottome, to the uttermost, to know any thing concerning a duty in any kind, when he laboureth not to convince his heart, to this end, that he may be brought in every thing to obey God, when he stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out with God in any one point: this man liveth to himselfe, and walketh not as he should, according to the rule of God. Now then (beloved) let us be convinced of it, I beseech you, take it home, and let every man consider of it with himselfe. Sometime in the actions of religion there commeth matter of glory in the world, &amp; this set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth me forward much: when these things are spoken against, and when I shal suffer disadvantages, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not hold out. At another time, though all things be wel, yet if it crosse me in such a course, I mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, as if it were an unprofitable thing to serve God. And then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain when God revealeth his will my froward and rebellious heart hath hung backe, and beene unwilling to submit to Gods wil in this point: all this while I have lived to my self. And if it be true: if a man be in Christ, he liveth not to himself, then it follows: if a man liveth to himself, he is out of Ghrist; <hi>If the weakest Christian live to Christ, then the best that liveth to himselfe is out of Christ.</hi> Be convinced of this first.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Be convinced, as it is the case of our selves: so it is an <note place="margin">2. That it is an evill thing for a man to live to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> ill estate for a man to live to himselfe. You see still it is the whole drift of wicked men to looke to themselves. <hi>Haman</hi> aimed at him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: when the King asked him, <hi>what should be done to the man whom the King would honour?</hi> He thought, whom should the King honour but himselfe? He looked to himselfe. Here was the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>Mordecai,</hi> both had honour in the world: <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> seekes himselfe in all his honour. <hi>Mordecai</hi> seekes God, and his glory, and the welfare of his Church in his honour: A great
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:14764:112"/>
difference. Saith <hi>Nabal: shal I take my bread, and my drink, and give it to a man that I know not?</hi> Here was a man that lived to himself. Compare him with <hi>Iob; He was a foot to the lame, an eye to the blind;</hi> he continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fed those that wanted food. A great difference: <hi>Iob</hi> lived to God, and therefore he honoured God in releeving many with the estate that God had given him: <hi>Nabal</hi> lived to himselfe, therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded none but himselfe, and his owne house, and sheep-shearers, and those that depended upon him. This is the propeirtie of a man out of Christ to seeke hmselfe, and live to himselfe in all things.</p>
                  <p>Againe consider, others that have gone further in matters of religion, yet they have still turned out of the way, as farre as they have halted in this. <hi>Matt. 6. 22. If thine eye be single, the whole body is light: but if thine eye be wicked, the whole body is darknesse.</hi> A wicked <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 22.</note> eye is supposed to a single eye: a double eye is a wicked eye: What is a single eye? That that lookes but upon one object, upon <note place="margin">A single eye, what.</note> God, and God onely, and God principally: and on all other things in him, and with reference to him. Now the double eye, is that, that though it lookes to God, and doe many things in obedience to God: yet it lookes to somewat else, and takes other things as greater incouragements: this is a wicked eye, and such a man wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in darknesse: when he lookes to God, hee hath light in the duty: when he lookes to men, and other things, then hee turneth aside, and runneth to by-wayes: And therefore <hi>a double-minded</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>man is unconstant in all his wayes.</hi> What is a double-minded man? He is a double-minded man, whose mind is set upon more things then one: first on the world, and then on God: as farre as hee sees it is profitable, he will serve God, or else not. This man is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant man. You see it is an ill estate.</p>
                  <p>So much for the first Use, for conviction. Secondly therefore As many as are guiltie of this, labour to get out of it, not to live <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. For Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to your selves any more. Let it be enough, that you have lived thus long to your selves: that you have defrauded Christ of his due, that hath purchased you with his bloud, and not served him in holinesse and rigteousnesse, so many dayes of your life. Now for the time to come, let us serve him better.</p>
                  <p>And that you may doe thus. I will give you two sorts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, <note place="margin">Helpes.</note> or helpes. I can give you but the heads of them.</p>
                  <p>First, be convinced that our good is in God, and not in our selves: <note place="margin">1. Our good is in God, and not in our selves.</note> our life is in God, and not in our selves; our selves are in God, and not in our selves: that as the beams of the Sun are in the Sun more then in themselves, so a Christian is more in Christ then in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Whatsoever is good and comfortable to him, is in Christ: he hath all by vertue of a union with Christ: he is not at all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py or blessed, further then he is in him. If then all our good lie in him, it is great reason all our actions should returne to him:
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:14764:112"/>
that he should be the Center where all our lynes should meet; the marke whereto all our actions should ayme. <hi>Let not the strong</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 9. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>man glory in his strength, or the wise man in his wisedome, or the rich man in his riches, but he that glorieth, let him glory in this, that hee knoweth mee, that I am the Lord.</hi> Jer. 9. 24. What Lord? <hi>The Lord that sheweth judgement and righteousnesse upon the earth:</hi> there is a mercy shewed to the creature, but it is I that doe it, saith the Lord. If you meet with a mercifull man, God is mercifull in that man: If you meet with a bountifull man, God is bountifull in that man: If you meet with a man whose <hi>lippes feed many,</hi> God instructeth that man. I say, seeing all things we have, though they have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers channels and pipes, and conveyances, whereby God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyeth goodnesse and mercy to men, yet neverthelesse, it is in God, and from God we receive all; let us therefore looke upon every creature as instruments in Gods hand, that can doe us nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor hurt without him. What good it doth, it doth by the influence of the supreame cause, working by that creature: let us so looke upon, and conceive of every creature.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Saints have done in all times. <hi>Iacob</hi> when hee saw <hi>Esau; I have seene thy face, as the face of God</hi> (saith hee.) Hee saw God in the face of <hi>Esau.</hi> So in all good men, we should say, God is good in them. This should make men not to seeke themselves; not to study men more then God: not to studie gaine with men, with the losse of God: to please men, with the displeasing of God: but to venture the losse of all men, that they may please God, if they cannot keepe men and God together. For the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of men are in Gods hand, and he fashioneth, and frameth them, according to his owne pleasure, eitherto love, or hatred, as <hi>David</hi> obserued in the case of <hi>Shimei, God hath bid him curse.</hi> Bee convinced, I say, of this, that if we get all the men in the world to be our friends, with the neglect of God, if we get all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and wealth of the world: if a man were advanced to the Monarchie of the whole earth: yet these things are more in Gods hand, then in ours. When a man hath wealth, it is not in his owne keeping: riches have wings. When a man hath fauour, God gives it not into his owne keeping: whatsoever wee have, it is secured to us by Gods protection, and made good to us by his blessing.</p>
                  <p>Let this be our care, and worke therefore, how we may live to God: how we may enjoy God, in the things we enjoy, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse God in all things we possesse: in the things we have, still to keepe God, and that will keepe our estates, and names, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and lives, and all. That is the first.</p>
                  <p>Againe secondly; There are certaine graces to bee exercised, <note place="margin">2. Exercise the grace.</note> if a man would not live to himselfe (for indeed it is the propertie
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:14764:113"/>
of a Christian, and none else to live to God, and not to himselfe: and he doth it by vertue of those graces in his heart, that empties him of himselfe, and drawes him to God: therefore, I say, there are certaine graces that every one should exercise, if he would not live to himselfe) What are those?</p>
                  <p>First, the knowledge of God in Christ. Get a more full and <note place="margin">Of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> particular, and experimentall knowledge of God. All our look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the creature is, because we know not God perfectly: if we did know him, we would account <hi>him the chiefest of tenne thousand,</hi> the Church when she knew Christ, said so: wee would account <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 1 Sam. 1.</note> him (as <hi>Elkanah</hi> said to <hi>Hannah; Am not I better to thee then tenne sounes?)</hi> better then tenne friends, then ten worlds. Get there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a more full knowledge of God: that all power is in him: <hi>One thing have I heard once and twice, that power belongeth unto God,</hi> saith the Psalmist.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Get faith in the exercise more. All the worthies of <note place="margin">Of Faith.</note> the Lord in that 11. <hi>Hebr.</hi> What made them live <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>o to God, and not to themselves as they did? because they beleeved, they did it by faith: <hi>by faith Abraham denied himselfe: by faith Moses forsooke the pleasures of Egypt: by faith those Worthies, of whom the world was not worthy, wandred up and downe in sheepes skins, and goats skins, and would not be delivered.</hi> When a man getteth interest in Christ by faith, he shall see that in him, that will satisfie all his desires, and answer all his losses.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, exercise Love. Faith workes by love. The more we love God in Christ, the more perfectly wee shall cleave to him: <note place="margin">Of Love.</note> Love is a uniting grace, that uniteth the soule to Christ. <hi>The love of Christ constraineth mee</hi> (saith the Apostle 2 <hi>Cor. 5.) for wee thus judge, if one died for all, then it is fit they that live should not live to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>themselves.</hi> And the truth is, the more a soule loveth Christ, the more it will live to him.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, a word of the last Use, and that is for instruction. Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced that such is the estate of most men, that they live <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3. For instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> to themselves: and that whose estate soever it is, it is a sinfull estate, and argueth a man out of Christ: and that there is a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of getting out of this estate. Let it be for instruction to all those, that in some measure live to God, and not to themselves: let it be to teach them, and perswade them more fully to live to him, and lesse to themselves. A man simply considered without any relation to others, or dependance upon another man, he may please himselfe: but when a man is considered in his dependance upon God, and his relation to men: hee must then observe the will of his Creatour, in that relation God hath set him: he must carry himselfe as his creature, and observe the end that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is appointed to. Nay, he must carry himselfe as a Christian,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:14764:113"/>
and observe the good of the body: hee must carry himselfe as a member, to doe good to the whole. Let every Christian labour to doe this, if he would have comfort to his soule, that hee doth not live to himselfe, that he is of the number of those that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God in life and death. Labour to imploy, his time, and strength; and gifts, and whatsoever he is, and hath, to the good of others: <hi>As every man hath received the gift, let him minister to others, as faithfull dispencers of the manifold grace of God.</hi> If you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived gifts, you have received them from God, you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them for the good of others, you have received them as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensers: let every man (saith the Apostle) dispense the manifold grace of God: if the Apostle had said, be dispensers of the grace of knowledge that you have, for the feeding of the soules of many: and not of your estates: or, relieve as many as you can with your estates, but take no care for their soules: but when hee saith, be dispensers of the manifold gifts of God, his meaning is, that whatsoever I have wherewith I am able to doe men good with, whether it be inward or outward gifts, the gifts of the mind, or of the outward man, anything whereby I can bee advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to others; I must serve God and men in improving of that. He that will not live to himselfe, is bound to serve every man with every gift he hath.</p>
                  <p>If God have furnished a man with inward gifts, the graces of his Spirit. If a man have knowledge, and faith, or experience, or comfort, whatsoever graces of the Spirit hee hath, there are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties appointed, and a Communion of Saints exprest, that men may be stirred up to exercise those graces in that communion for the good of all the Saints. Therefore wee are said <hi>to have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. Eph. 4. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>to profit with. And gifts to edifie with.</hi> All that a man hath, God hath given him for this end, that God may be glorified by it: <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, that you bring forth much fruit. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good workes, and glorifie your Father which is in heaven.</hi> Men have much benefit by the graces of the Spirit in others; when they are improved as they ought, they are as lights amongst men in the world. Grace when it is opened (like the Box of oyntment) raiseth a desire in others after it. Grace exercised and communicated to others, it sheweth the amiablenesse of it. Christians should therefore doe it, that they may make Christianity lovely: that they may make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Religion amiable to the world, that is by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the graces of God to others. This every man should doe, in his place, in his person, take all advantages this way.</p>
                  <p>And as it is good for others, so it is good for a mans selfe to doe thus, a man increaseth his owne store. <hi>Liberalitie</hi> (we say) <hi>is the best husbandrie.</hi> There is no promise in the Scripture for hoarding
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:14764:114"/>
up, there are many to distribute. I say it is the best husbandrie in the world, especially in spirituall things: it is as the oyle, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the pouring out: like the loaves, the more they were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the more they multiplied still. We see the hand nourisheth it selfe by administring food to the mouth: so a Christian, not onely exerciseth, but increaseth grace in himselfe by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating grace to others.</p>
                  <p>And what I say for spirituall, I say for outward things. If a man have wealth, or honour, or any of these outward things, and an opportunitie, he should imploy them for others, that it may appeare that hee doth not live to himselfe. Hee that layeth up riches only for himselfe, and his family, liveth to himselfe. Hee that followeth his calling only for himselfe, and his family, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to himselfe. Hee doth that which a man out of Christ would doe: but a man that would live unto God, hee must glorifie God with his estate. <hi>To doe good, and to distribute, forget not, for with such sacrifices God is pleased,</hi> Heb. 13. <hi>Charge them that are rich in the world, that they bee not high-minded, but ready to distribute to the necessities of the Saints. 1 Tim.</hi> 3. It is a charge laid upon all, to glorifie God with their estates: with their Authoritie as they are Magistrates: as <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>I was a foot to the lame, an eye to the blind, a father to the fatherlesse, a husband to the widow:</hi> Hee did all things for the good of others. All men are ambassadours sent from God, for the good of the bodies, and soules of others. Am I a neighbour, it is for the good of the body and soule of every one that convers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with me, according to the manifold gifts bestowed upon me: and I live no further to God, then I doe extend, and communicate all my particular gifts to the good of others, both for soule and body.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have the point opened, and pressed, concerning li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to our selves, as a marke of those that are Christs, that they doe not live to themselves. I beseech you (brethren,) let this be the advantage of <hi>Funerall Sermons,</hi> that are preached upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the death of our deceased brethren, to teach us how to live. Let every man hereafter resolue to lead a profitable and fruitfull life: to doe all the good he can while he liveth, that <hi>for much good done to many, thankes may bee given by many on his behalfe.</hi>

                        <p>But this I say, brethren, the time is short; It remaineth, that both they that have wives, be as though they had none: and they that weepe, as though they wept not: and they that rejoyce, as if they rejoyced not: and they that buy, as though they possessed not: and they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat I may briefly come to open <note place="margin">The Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</note> to you the summe of that that I have to deliver out of this Scripture: I desire you (beloved in the Lord) in few words, to take notice of the drift and scope of the holy Apostle in this place: and that is this.</p>
                  <p>The Corinths (as it seemeth in the beginning of this chapter) had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a Letter to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> wherein they did propound to him divers Cases of conscience: and did intreate him, that he would send his judgement, concerning those points. Some five or six we may gather they did write to him about.</p>
                  <p>One was this; whether he thought it either a lawfull, or a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thing for a man to marrie.</p>
                  <p>The second was; Whether if a man were married, his wife and he might not separate themselves one from another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:14764:116"/>
The third was; If they did live together, whether it were lawfull, for the one to denie to the other matrimonall benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                  <p>The fourth; Whether if one of them being a beleever, and the other an Infidell, it were lawfull, or convenient for the beleever to remaine a yoke-fellow to the Infidell. These and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cases of conscience, they intreated Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to resolve them in.</p>
                  <p>Now the Apostle in the beginning of this Chapter writeth an Answer to every one of these Questions they propounded. To some of them he answered thus; <hi>Indeed I cannot give an absolute determination what is to be done, but I suppose, this and this is best.</hi> And to another, <hi>I advise such a thing: I cannot directly determine the will of God, but I have received mercie of God to bee accounted faithfull, and if you would know my opinion it is this.</hi> And so he hee giveth divers doubtfull answers to their Questions: only he telleth them, this is fittest for the oportunitie.</p>
                  <p>When he hath done all, he commeth to this I have read. <hi>But this I say brethren,</hi> &amp;c. As if he should say; The Questions I have given you an Answer to, I thinke you know not what to resolve upon, because I say only this is my counsell, or this is my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But this I am peremptory in, that is, <hi>That they that have wives bee as if they had none: they that weepe, as if they wept not: and they that rejoyce, as if they rejoyced not,</hi> This, I doe not come to say <hi>I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: and I thinke it fit, or I give my advise, or for the present occasion it is fit to beethas. But brethren,</hi> herein I am confidenr, and resolute. that <hi>you should bee as if not</hi> in all things: in this I am bold. This is the drift of the Apostle, that hee would bring in one thing wherein he is confident, after the resolution of of divers Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein he could not be so confident.</p>
                  <p>So then, the words I have read, containe two generall things. <note place="margin">Division of the Text. 1. Preface. 2. Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, the Apostles Preface to his Exhortation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Exhortation it selfe.</p>
                  <p>The Preface in these words, <hi>But this I say brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Exhortation in the rest of the words, <hi>The time is short,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In the Exhortation there are likewise three things that I would <note place="margin">In the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation. 1. The ground of it.</note> note unto you.</p>
                  <p>First, the ground of the Exhortation in these words; <hi>The time is short.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly the Exhortation it selfe, in these words: <hi>It remaineth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation it selfe.</note> 
                     <hi>that they that have wives, bee as though they had none: and they that weepe, as if they wept not: and they that rejoyce, as if they rejoyced not: and they that buy, as if they possessed not: and they that use the world as not abusing it.</hi> Here is the Exhortation.</p>
                  <p>Then the third thing, is a spurre the Apostle addeth to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">3. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivo.</note>
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:14764:116"/>
them up, to practise all these things, in these words, <hi>For the fashion of this world passeth away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first generall thing in the words, is the Apostles Preface, <note place="margin">In the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</note> 
                     <hi>But this I say brethren.</hi> And in this I would note but two things: I will but name them (because I would not be straitned in two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall points that I would gladly open.)</p>
                  <p>First here I would note: <hi>How confident, and earnest and resolute a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 1.</note> 
                     <hi>faithfull minister will be, when hee commeth to a point that mainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes his people.</hi> In all other things the Apostle giveth them his Answer, so as it might seeme, hee had not fully resolved them. <hi>I give my advise</hi> (saith hee) and againe, <hi>I suppose this.</hi> But now when he commeth unto the right use of the world, that it bee not abused: and the thought of heaven, that they might set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves about it. Here he commeth without <hi>ifs and ands,</hi> he setteth it downe resolutely and positively. <hi>Brethren, this I say, or this you must doe.</hi> This is one thing that I might note.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I might note; <hi>The compellation, or terme that hee giveth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Observat. 2</note> 
                     <hi>them: Brethren.</hi> In which, note who they are, to whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giveth the Exhortation. And it seemeth to mee, as if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle should say; I am putting you now upon a duty, that if I could not give you the terme, <hi>brethren,</hi> I should hope to prevaile little with you. To come and tell a young gallant that is in the middest of his ruffe, and his jollitie, and all pleasures: <hi>the fashion of this world passeth away,</hi> and I would have you <hi>use these things, as if you used them not:</hi> I know he would not receive it. Or to come to an old soaked worldling, whose <hi>Mammon</hi> and pennie is his god, whose thoughts runne altogether upon his wealth: and to tell him, that <hi>hee should use the world, as if hee used it not.</hi> Or to come to another that is newly married, and it may be hath made a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse of his yoake-fellow for a while, and tell him <hi>that he must bee as if he were not married:</hi> I should have little hope to prevaile with these. But you are <hi>brethren:</hi> and because <hi>brethren</hi> you know the good things of God, you are acquainted with things concerning eternall happinesse: therefore as long as I can call you <hi>brethren,</hi> I am bold to put you upon the dutie.</p>
                  <p>So (brethren) this is my Preface to you. I shall anon speake to a point that I shall have little hope to prevaile with many in the Congregation: when I come to speake of the immoderate use of the world, and all the blessings in it, it may bee both your eares will be so stopped against it. But as many of you as are <hi>brethren,</hi> that have given up your selves to God, and have taken him for your portion, and his Word for your guide in all things: I hope you will bring willing and yeelding hearts, to resolve that what is delivered out of the word of God, to embrace it, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour it, concerning the course of your lives. And so, this shall
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:14764:117"/>
suffice for the Preface, because (as I said) I would not bee strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>Now I come to the Exhortation. <hi>It remaineth that they that have wives, be as if they had none,</hi> &amp;c. First I will in briefe open the <note place="margin">In the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</note> words, and then come to some matter of instruction.</p>
                  <p>I begin first with the ground of the Exhortation. <hi>The time is</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. The grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of it.</note> 
                     <hi>short.</hi> The word translated <hi>short,</hi> signifieth in the originall, Time cut off. And so the Apostle aludeth (as the best Expositors agree) <note place="margin">The meaning of the words</note> to Seafayring-men: that have almost done their voyage, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to strike sayle, and to fold them up together, and are even put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into the Harbour, and are going to unlade their goods. So saith the Apostle, <hi>the time is short:</hi> as if he should say: if a company, that are going out a long voyage, should strive who should be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, &amp; who be masters-Mate, and who should have this or that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Ship, I could not greatly blame them. But when they are almost at home, when they are within a flight-shot of the shoare, when they begin to strike sayle, to take in all, and to goe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of the ship: then if they should fall a quarrelling for places, and contend, and use all the friends and meanes they could make, it were a ridiculous thing, and folly. So it is with us. Time was when the world was in beginning, and then when a man came into the world, hee might say, by the course of nature, I have a matter of six, or seven, or eight, or nine hundred yeares, to goe on in my pilgrimage, before I shall end my voyage: and then if a man should bestow a little time to thinke with himselfe; Well, if I can live but to see my selfe the father of a thousand children, and might come to people almost a whole Countrey, &amp;c. then I say, if a man should greet the world, he might bee excused. But brethren, God hath cast out the time of our age so, that assoone as wee begin our voyage, wee are ready to strike sayle presently. Wee have but a little time to continue, and much worke to bee done for another life: therefore for us to stand striving about wives and children, and courtesies: to cry out of afflictions, when we are ready to strike sayle, and even to goe out of the ship into the harbour, it is a meere folly. These things are not worth the while, heaven is the thing we should looke after, therefore let us be moderate in all these things. This is the meaning.</p>
                  <p>So that the ground of the Exhortation, affordeth two things. The one I will but name; The other I will stand upon.</p>
                  <p>First; <hi>The time of our life in this world is very short.</hi> Wee have a <note place="margin">Obser. 1.</note> very little time to continue in this world. This is a very fruitfull and profitable point, but because I would not bee straitned, and because the Apostle intends it not as the maine thing, I doe but only name it.</p>
                  <p>The second thing (and that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> mainly intends) <note place="margin">Obser. 2.</note>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:14764:117"/>
is that because wee have but a little time, wee are even ready to strike sayle, and to goe to the Harbour presently, therefore <hi>hee that had a wife should bee as if hee had none, and hee that used the world, as if hee used it not,</hi> &amp;c. And there the Lesson that I note is this;</p>
                  <p>That the serious meditation of the little and short time that we <note place="margin">The medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the shortnesse of our lives, a special means to take us off of the world.</note> have to remaine in here below, should bee a great meanes, to cut us off from the world, and to put us upon thoughts and actions concerning heaven.</p>
                  <p>I shall not need to give you a better ground of the point then is in the Text. <hi>The time is short</hi> (saith he) the time is contracted, you are ready to strike sayle: therefore doe this.</p>
                  <p>I might give you a world of Scripture to prove this. But I will satisfie my selfe in laying you downe two or three grounds of it.</p>
                  <p>First, wee know, that all things that ever a man can enjoy in <note place="margin">Reas. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> this world, they all die, assoone as ever his time is gone. Marke it: All things here below, let a man dote never so much upon them: let him have wife, and children, and beauty, and credit, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and learning, or whatsoever it is, if his glasse be out, if his time be gone, there is an end of all these to him. Now, the soule of man careth not for that happinesse, that hath no continuance at all in it; Yea, the rarest thing that mortall men seeke after, if they should know before hand that they should enjoy them but a little time, the soule careth not for pitching upon it. If a man were offered the goodliest woman for his wife, that ever lived in this world: if God should send him this message; there take her, I bestow her freely upon thee, but to morrow thou shalt die: who would care for marrying? To bee a King, we know, is sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the greatest thing that men seeke after in this world: yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Grecian Cities (as that of <hi>Sparta)</hi> because one was but to have the kingdome but for a yeare, and then to lay downe his Crowne, and become a private man: all the wisest men of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, strove as much not to be King, as we to get great places. Why? because they knew that that honour was but for a yeare; and that would be gone presently, therefore they cared not for it. So the Apostle teacheth in this place. Though thou shouldest have a wife that thou shouldest love mightily: though thou shouldest have pleasures, that thou takest full content in: Why doest thou so? Wee are ready to strike sayle; wee have but a little time to continue. So that because all the blessings of this life, let them be never so many, never so great, yet they all die with us, when our time is ended: hee that could but seriously thinke, that hee hath
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:14764:118"/>
but a little time to continue below, hee will never let his heart be set violently upon them: that is the first Argument.</p>
                  <p>The second, and principall Reason, why the meditation of the <note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> shortnesse of our time should bee such a marvellous meanes to take us off, from all the things of the world is this. Because wee shall find worke enough in this short time, for things that more concerne us. Now the very nature of our soule that God hath put into us, is this, that a man cannot intend earnestly and violently, two things at the same time. Let a man for a certaine houre whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee tooke up with some businesse, though there were a great many other things, that he could find in his heart to thinke upon: yet the soule intends that one mainly, and can find no time for the other. Thus is our case. Wee have but a little time: but in that little time, admirable is the worke wee have to doe, before this time be spent, if wee would give a comfortable account.</p>
                  <p>What have we to doe?</p>
                  <p>I tell you in a word. The maine and needfull thing of all that <note place="margin">What is the principall thing we have to doe in the world.</note> wee have to doe in this little time here allotted us is; How to shoote the gulph of hell: how to make our peace with God: how to get his favour in Christ; how to have the corruptions of our soule cured and healed; how to grow up in grace, and to get sure evidence against that day, when all shall stand naked before him, that then we may be found in Christ. Have I ever heard that I have a great worke to doe, and that I have but a little time to doe it in? Surely then if I seriously thinke of it, I cannot find in my heart, to let my soule pitch earnestly upon the things below. Beloved, our time here, is the only time we have to make heaven sure. It is the most precious thing that ever we have in the world. Now if a man have such a precious thing, and but a little of it, will hee goe and spend it for toyes and baubles.</p>
                  <p>It is a thing that the Emperour <hi>Caligula</hi> is laughed at for, in all Stories. There was a mighty Navie provided, admirable and strange, and all trimmed: and every one expected, that with it, the whole countrey of Greece should be conquered: and so it might have beene. But hee imploped his souldiers to gather a company of Cockleshells, and pibles, and so sayled home. Had not every one cause to lavgh at the folly of this Emperour? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, such a foole is every man, and so wee would acknowledge, if wee would but weigh this: God hath given thee but thus much time, it may be twenty yeares, it may be but a day or two more: in this time he hath furnished thee with that, which may bee a meanes to conquer heaven it selfe: now if thou lay out this little, about wife, or children, or to purchase a little wealth, or these things here below: is it not the greatest folly that may bee?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:14764:118"/>
Suppose that a servant hath a great deale of worke to doe, and knowes that he must give an account to his Master thereof, and that if all be not done, that should bee done, he can never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare with comfort before his Master; and hee sees also that the Sunne drawes low, and the day hastneth to an end, doe you thinke that this servant can find time to play? If a man have much to write, and but a little paper to write in, he must write small and thicke, and close as ever hee can. So it is with every one of us: I warrant you there is not any soule of us, but wee shall find so many thousand things to repent of, so many graces to obtaine, that wee stand in need of: so many evidences for heaven to get, that yet we have not got sealed, so many particulars concerning a better life, that a man may wonder that ever any one should find one halfe day to intend any thing else.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see the reasons, why the serious meditation of the little time we have to continue below, should bee a marvellous meanes to take us off from the world, and to put us upon the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and thought of better things.</p>
                  <p>Well now, let me briefly apply this unto you; that so I may come to that I principally intend.</p>
                  <p>Oh that we had learned this excellent lesson, that the Apostle <note place="margin">Vse.</note> teacheth the Corinths here, what wondrous happy people should wee be?</p>
                  <p>You shall find ever-more in the Scripture, the Spirit of God putting the neglect that is amongst men, and carelesnesse of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <note place="margin">The ground of all our neglect of heaven, is the want of the consideration of the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this life.</note> and all the wickednesse of their lives upon this, the not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious meditation of that small time they have to continue below.</p>
                  <p>If a man come to those that are not brethren, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakes the Corinths in the Text: they will say; It is true, it is a good point to be prest upon a man that is in a consumption, on one whom the Doctours have given over: to tell him that hee cannot continue a weeke, that his time is short, But for our parts wee are but in the beginning of our voyage: it may be, wee are but twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares old: we began but the other day to be furnished with a stocke: wee we are but newly entred: and doe you thinke that we are striking sayle? Or another that hath lived fortie or fiftie yeares, in the middest of a full trade, that beginneth to get some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world: doe you thinke that he is striking sayle? Thus people put it off. Alas! what is thy time? What is all thy life? Let God decide it: doth not he say, <hi>it is a vapour, a dreame, a tale that is told, like a Ship that sayleth by, and is gone,</hi> and that in the turning of a hand almost? If thou have no more time of life here, but only while a little sand is running out of a glasse, while a Ship is sayling out of sight, while a short tale is told (God saith it is
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:14764:119"/>
no more) wilt thou account that thy voyage is yet scarsly begun?</p>
                  <p>I beseech you (beloved) all goe home, and often thinke of this point. Say within yourselves: How long Lord, am I like to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue below? and what is there for me to doe before I goe out of this world?</p>
                  <p>But the truth is, men dare not thinke of this: and the divell la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth <note place="margin">Sath an la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours above all things, to make men put off the consideration of the brevity of their lives.</note> for nothing more in the world then this, to make men put off the serious consideration of the brevitie of their lives, and that they have longertime to continue here, then they have: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee knowes the truth of this, that I have spoken, that the meditation thereof will stirre them up, to make cleare all recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings with God, before they goe hence, and bee seene no more. You may find this to be true in your owne experience, how loath men are to entertaine thoughts of their latter end: Goe to one that lies sicke of a Consumption, and hee will tell you: the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors say, that I may live, and I doubt not but I shall get up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: such a one hath beene brought as low as I, and hee is recovered, and why may not I. I once knew one that when the Phisitians came and told him, that hee must die: Good Lord (said hee) what a deale of worke have I to doe: I have all my seed to sow: all my evidences to seale that my soule should bee saved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such thoughts should enter into us now: pitch on them seriously: buckle to them soundly.</p>
                  <p>Wee may learne this point of wisedome of the divell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; Hee, because hee knoweth his time is short, hee is so much the fuller of rage and malice; and plies his worke with so much the more eagernesse. <hi>Woe bee to the Inhabitants of the earth, and the Sea</hi> (Revelat. 12. 12.) <hi>for the divell is gone out amongst men, having great wrath, because hee knoweth that hee hath but a short time.</hi> So should wee doe. Thinke with thy selfe: the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Angel</hi> will come ere long, <hi>and sweare by him that liveth for ever and ever, that there shall bee no more time:</hi> but GOD will have an account for the time past. What if the <hi>Angel</hi> should come now and sweare (as tenne to one but there is some man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in this Congregation, concerning whom GOD hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that they shall have no more time before a weeke bee at an end) Put the case it should bee any ones case, thine or mine, that God should say, Goe fetch such a man, I will give him no more time; It is true, I gave him some, but now his voyage is at an end, his sayle is strucke: and then we shouldhave all to seeke, no Christ, no true faith, no evidence for Heaven; when wee must come and give an account to God. What have you done with all your time? will God say? I must have a reckoning of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:14764:119"/>
And then commeth in, <hi>Imprimis,</hi> so much time in drinking, so much in revelling, so much in dressing my selfe every day. And then God shall say; Were these the things I gave you time for? Did I bestow time on you, for to bee spent about such things as these? No, it was for Heaven. Beloved, how could we answer to these things?</p>
                  <p>It is good and profitable, seriously to consider of this betimes: say to thy selfe, I have not long to live, after a while I must goe hence, and be no more: <hi>I must give an account, and a reckoning unto God, of all that I have done, whether it bee good or evill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is not the principall point I have to speake of, therefore I passe it briefly. I come to the Exhortation it <note place="margin">2. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation it selfe.</note> selfe. <hi>It remaineth that both they that have wives, bee as though they had none; and they that weepe, as if they wept not; and they that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; and they that use the world, as not abusing it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In a word: I take the summe of the Exhortation to be, as if the <note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the words.</note> Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> had said thus;</p>
                  <p>Brethren; you are ready to cast anchor: trouble not your selves: bee stedfast; gird up the loynes of your mindes: let your care bee greatest for heaven: as for these things that are here below, if you have wives, bee as if you had none; thinke, assoone as you are ashoare, you shall have none: if you bee sicke, or under any crosse, or affliction, bee as though you wept not: sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you bee as a fellow that is faine to plie the pumpe all the day, assoone as hee is ashoare, hee is free: if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, if you be in prosperity, if you be as the Master of the Ship that hath great preferment, bee as if you rejoyced not: Why? you are almost come ashoare; therefore bee, as if not, in all these.</p>
                  <p>I will briefly open the meaning of all these particulars, and then put all into one point of instruction, and so come further to applie it unto you, as God shall enable me.</p>
                  <p>What therefore is the meaning? first, <hi>Let them that have wives, bee as though they had none.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To that I answer; A man that hath a Wife, hath two things <note place="margin">What is meant by having wives, and yet to be as having none.</note> that another hath not, that hath no wife.</p>
                  <p>The first is, He hath a great deale of joy and comfort: he hath a second selfe, a loving yoak-fellow; one in whose Bosome hee can poure his heart at any time: one that he can make partaker of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:14764:120"/>
all his contentments: one that is willing to helpe him to carry all his crosses: so in a Wife (supposing her to be a good Wife) hee hath that comfort that another knowes not of.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he that hath a Wife, hath a great many cares that another hath not: hee hath a great deale of feare lest hee should leave her in distresse: a great deale of care how shee, and the children that are begotten by him of her, should be provided for, when he is gone: so that as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, hee cannot but care for the things of the world, how he may give content to his wife. These two things a man hath, that hath a Wife.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>What is it to bee in this, as if hee had no wife?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is this; In all contentments that come by a wife to use them as if hee had none at all: that is, to be moderate, not to glu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> himselfe, and to thinke, now I am a happy man, I need no more, God hath given me such a yoake-fellow, and I have abundant joy in it. But to moderate his heart in this.</p>
                  <p>And for the other thing, for care, and thought how to provide for her and her children: to goe on, as if he had no wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to provide for: to leave all to God: to goe on in his calling in obedience to God, and let God doe what hee will. And for matter of providing food and rayment, when hee is gone, let him even carry himselfe, as if all the world were gone, when hee is gone. <hi>This is to have a wife, as if hee had none:</hi> to be as moderate in the enjoying of the contentments that come by his wife: to be as moderate in cares required for a Wife, so moderate in them, as if he had no wife at all to joy in, or to take care for.</p>
                  <p>For the second; <hi>They that weepe, as if they wept not.</hi> That is, for <note place="margin">2. By weeping as if they wept not.</note> matter of Affliction. One man commeth out, and he exceedingly glorieth in his happinesse that he hath a wife. Another complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net: no man is so full of crosses as I: every day one crosse after another: no man hath such children: such a husband: such an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, so poore, so afflicted, so weake: ever groaning and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, Now, saith Saint <hi>Paul: bee as if not, in weeping.</hi> That is, let the thoughts of the neerenesse of the shoare make you so contented, as if there were no crosse at all lying upon you. For (I still follow the Metaphor the Spirit of God useth) hee that is the poorest man in the Ship, hee that doth nothing but dresse the sayles, and (as I said before) plie the pumpe, and it may be is bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten withall: yet in the middest of all these, he thinketh, I shall by and by cast Anchor, and though I worke hard, yet one houre more will make me free. So it should be with us, in all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>as if not:</hi> that is, Thinke, Death will come and end all, I am sicke in body, I am crost in my good name, in my yoake-fellow: Well, Death will end all these, I have but a little while to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>arry in this world, and short things must not be tedious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:14764:120"/>
On the other side; <hi>Hee that rejoyceth, as though hee rejoyced not.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. By rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, as if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced not.</note> That is, in all the contentments of the world: in all the joy a man hath in the things below: as suppose a man have an estate here, and credit given him, or any thing that makes the world account a man happy, Remember, all these things will be gone assoone as I die: as (still to use the comparison) let it bee the Master of the Ship, he may thinke with himselfe: all these are under me, I can command them, and punish them if they disobey: yet assoone as I am out of the Ship, they are as good as my selfe. I am now neere the shoare, and shall bee soone out of the place I am in, let me therefore moderate my selfe. So let us in all worldly content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be so moderate, as if wee should take our leaves of them, and they of us.</p>
                  <p>And so for a man, <hi>to bee as though hee possest not.</hi> That is, for a <note place="margin">4. By buying, as if possessed not.</note> man not to inlarge his heart, as the world is enlarged. But if I have now so many pounds, and therewith buy such a purchase, and such a purchase: let me live, and carry my selfe in my thoughts, as if I had nothing but food and rayment.</p>
                  <p>And then lastly commeth in the maine of all the rest: <hi>They</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5. By using the world, as not abusing it.</note> 
                     <hi>that use the world, as not abusing it.</hi> By <hi>world</hi> hee meanes, all the good things of the world, all that I named before, and all that you can else thinke of, Wife, and children, prosperity, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, every thing on the right hand, and on the left, all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth within the compasse of the World: use all these things so. But especially hee aymeth at worldly businesses, the things wee are exercised about: doe them as not abusing them, as not letting your hearts bee set too much upon them: but bee temperate and moderate in all, that we may ever be fit for that great service that God hath to imploy us in.</p>
                  <p>Now, out of all these put together: the mayne Lesson that I would speake of, is this;</p>
                  <p>That the true servants of God, true beleevers: all the blessings and <note place="margin">Observat.</note> erosses they meet with in this world, they must have them, as if they had them not.</p>
                  <p>This is the point I would open to you. That in wife, children, prosperity, crosses, thinke what you can, a beleever must bee in them, <hi>as if not:</hi> as if hee were not in that condition.</p>
                  <p>To give you for the proofe of this any other Scripture then my Text, I suppose I need not: the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (you see) layes it downe in so many words. Yet, for the better confirmation of the point, I will adde to that, two or three other plaine places. Only first, I would a little explaine to you, what it is for a man to use all these things, as if not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:14764:121"/>
And I cannot for my life, better lay it open to you, then by <note place="margin">Opened.</note> such a comparison as this. Looke how worldly men use the things of heaven: so a heavenly man must use the things of the world.</p>
                  <p>To instance in a few duties that I will but name. Suppose it be <note place="margin">A beleever is to be to the world, as a worldly man to the things of heaven.</note> the duty of prayer. Bring me out a true beleever, and a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, let them both be put upon this duty of prayer. The true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, his heart, before he goes to prayer, is so full of care, that hee may pray aright: so full of feare, lest his heart should not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it selfe as it should, when he is in the duty: his heart is so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently bent to it: it so strugleth and striveth, that hee may doe it, as may please God. When hee hath done, he hath much joy and comfort, if hee have carried it well: and much sorrow and griefe, if hee have carried it ill. Thus a religious heart carrieth it selfe in this duty. Now a worldly man doth the duty too: but how? as if not: that is, hee hath none of this care before hee commeth to it: he hath none of this trouble when he is at it: he hath none of this perplexitie, when he hath done, if he have miscarried in it. If hee be able to come off, it is well enough, though it be performed in never so ill a manner: Why? his mind is after other things, hee intends greater matters, as hee thinkes. The Minister hath taught him to pray, and he can say his prayers, and so hee doth the duty, but still, as if not.</p>
                  <p>Oragaine, suppose a man whose heart is set upon Mammon, put this man to recreation; hee may perhaps find time to play at Bowles, or Cards, or Tables with a friend: but how? hee cares not whether hee winnes or loses: hee whiles away the time, but this is not the thing his heart is set upon, that giveth him content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but that which his mind is on, is his commodities, his trade, his merchandize, his businesse in the world.</p>
                  <p>Iust thus (beloved) it must be with every true beleever in the using of all the things of this life, that is, without care, without feare, without perplexitie, without distraction, and if they come on, so: if they goe, so: he must be pleased if hee have them, and content if hee want them: and howsoever, his thoughts must bee carried higher and better. To thinke thus. I am the servant of God, I have a Calling here, I will follow it in obedience to God: I have a Wife, I will use her as a wife should be used: I have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, I will have a care of their education. But I must not come to be distracted, about my calling, about my wife, and children, and servants, and good name, or any thing that is here below. I am here to day, it may please God, I may bee gone to morrow: my hearts desire must be, to be content, with this that God is my all-sufficient portion: if I bee in prosperity, to be, as if not: if in affliction, to carry my selfe so, that in the middest of sorrow and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:14764:121"/>
trouble, to bee as if God have freed me from all, remembring still that my portion is in another life.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have seene both the lesson arising from the Text, and what that is, that in it is required of every true beleever.</p>
                  <p>And this point I am now to prove, and still I must use the compellation of the Apostle, <hi>Brethren,</hi> for as for others I have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hope of.</p>
                  <p>I will (as I promised) make it plaine out of the Scripture, <hi>That a true beleever, that would have comfort of it, that hee is a true beleever,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Proved by Scripture.</note> 
                     <hi>must be, as if not in all the things of this world.</hi> There is one eminent place for this purpose, <hi>viz. 1. Iohn</hi> 4. 10. Saith the Apostle there, <hi>Love not the world, nor the things of the worid: if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> Hence I argue thus; Hee <note place="margin">1 John 4. 10.</note> that must so use wife, children, credit, friends, good name, pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, without loving of them, it is likely he useth them <hi>as if not:</hi> for love is the great wheele that setteth all the faculties aworke: Now the Spirit of God doth directly forbid all Christians to love the world, or the things of the world (as they doe) the Scripture absolutely injoyneth that we should not love them, that is, that our hearts must not be fixed on them.</p>
                  <p>Another place you have likewise in <hi>Colloss. 3. 1. Set not your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections on things below.</hi> Now (as I said before) if any man doe <note place="margin">Col. 3. 1.</note> any thing, that his affections are not upon, that he doth not love, and joy, and delight in, that hee doth not take care for, and the like, certainly that man <hi>useth it as if not:</hi> but so must every true beleever, use the things of the world so, as that he must not set his affections upon them.</p>
                  <p>Other Scriptures I might give you to make good, this point, but I am somewhat afraid to bee straytned. Two or three argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I will adde to make it plaine, <hi>Why every true beleever must be, as if not, in all these things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, because all the things in this world (which are contained <note place="margin">By Reason. 1 The things of the world are emptie things to a beleever.</note> in the Text) they are all but emptie poore things to a beleever. To another man who makes them his God (in his conceit) they are full, but to a true beleever these things are well knowne to bee but emptie things. I need give you no better proofe to make this evident, then that which followeth in the Text: <hi>For the fashion of this world passeth away. The fashion of the world,</hi> What is that? That is, a thing that is a shew without a substance. Nay, the word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, such a fashion, as is in a Comedie, or stage-play, where all things are but for a while to please the eye: A man it may bee acts the part of a King, that is no better then a begger or a varlet: so all things in the world are no better then shadowes and empty, like a piece of a stage-play: and no marvell if beleevers that know this use them, as not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:14764:122"/>
Secondly, another argument why Beleevers must in all these <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. The things of the world are none of a beleevers.</note> things use them as if not, is, because they are none of a beleevers, and being none of his, it is a meere folly for him, to set his heart upon them. How are they none of his, you will say? First, for the truth of it, these things below, they belong to the men of this life: but the treasure and estate of a Beleever is laid up in another life; hee is but as a stranger and pilgrim here below, and therefore they are none of his. And then likewise they are none of his, because he hath resigned them all up to God, in the day when he made the bargaine for Christ. For when we come to be Christs, wee must sell all to buy that Pearle, and in selling all, <note place="margin">Note.</note> wee sell not only our corruptions and lusts, but wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and pleasures, and credit, and all: wee have them not now to have and to hold, to doe what wee will with them: but now that wee have Christ, wee returne all to him, and have them as Coppy-hold, to bee tenants at will to that great Land-lord: wee have only a little time in them. And if it be so, that every belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath no more to doe in this world but thus: that he is meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the pleasure of God, and can properly call nothing his owne, but God and Christ, then certainly, hee must use all these things as if not. Conceive it thus. A Traveller, goeth a long <note place="margin">Simile.</note> journey, hee commeth at night to his Inne, when hee is there, hee is wondrous glad, of his table, of his bed, of his fire, of his meat and drinke, and every thing, and hee is wondrous welcome: but hee doth not so delight in them, as the host of the house, who is living there, and is right owner, and hath the whole estate: No, hee only resteth there for a night after his weary journey, but on the morrow, God be with you, then hee is gone. So, a worldly man, he may say here is my estate, here is my stocke, all that I have is layed up here. But a Beleever saith, I am now in my journey, I am here, no other, then a pilgrim, my home is in Heaven, and while I am passing through this pilgrimage; If I have a piece of meat in my hunger, and a cup of drinke in my thirst, and clothes in my nakednesse, there is all that I care for.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the last and the maine Argument to proue that every <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. The things of the world hinder a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever in the service of God.</note> true beleever <hi>must bee, as if not,</hi> in all the things of this world is, because if he be any otherwise in them, hee will be so intangled, that hee shall not be fit for the service of God. And this third Argument will be of the greatest force to a true beleever. For the other two, you will say, if they be none of mine, why doe I meddle with them? and if they be empty, why likewise doe I meddle with them? But now thirdly, if I meddle with them, they will make me directly that I shall not bee a Christian, they will hinder me from the service of my God; this will make a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever of all things, to looke about him. The Apostle saith

directly, <hi>that none that warreth intangleth himselfe:</hi> that is thus: Suppose a man have received presse-money to goe a souldier, will he be so madde as to lay out his money upon a Farme in the Countrey, when upon the command of his Captaine, upon paine <note place="margin">Simile.</note> of death, he must follow presently. Beloved, he that intangleth himselfe with the things of the world, and of the flesh, if his wife, his pleasures, his credit, or any thing have taken up his heart: or if sorrowes and afflictions drinke up his spirits, and eate up his very soule; when God calls this man now to come to prayer, to come to the Church, to heare his Word, to fight against his lusts, or to doe any duty, alas! his head, his heart, and all, are eaten up, with his Farme, with his oxen, with his wife, with his crosses and afflictions: so that he is altogether unfit for any service that God hath called him to. Therefore (saith Saint <hi>Iohn)</hi> he that intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himselfe with these things below, hee cannot possibly have the love of the Father dwelling in him.</p>
                  <p>This shall suffice for the clearing of the point, I have spent the more time in it, because I would faine lay as good a foundation as I might, that the Application may take the deeper impression in your hearts.</p>
                  <p>Wee that live in the Countrey, when we come up by occasion <note place="margin">Vse.</note> into the Citie, and here see all men so full of trouble, every man so toyled in his worke, so full of businesse, and so little time ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for any thing else, me thinkes that such a point as this to <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> to beleevers should be of speciall use. Now (beloved) this is the summe of that I have to say; <hi>Bee in all these things, as if not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Shall wee all resolve, as obedient children to carry this point home, and examine in deed, and in truth, whether wee be in these things, as if not. But alas what shall I say? I remember a story <note place="margin">Reprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> of one <hi>Thomas Lennot,</hi> a learned English man, who reading once in the fifth, sixth, and seventh Chapters of S. <hi>Mathews</hi> Gospel, how our Saviour Christ saith; <hi>You have heard how it hath beene said of old, you must doe thus and thus, but I say unto you, you must love your enemies, pray for them that curse you, doe good to them that hate you, and persecute you;</hi> and so hee goeth on in injoyning such strange duties to flesh and bloud. Hee breakes out; <hi>Oh Iesus, either this is not thy Gospel, or wee are not Christians.</hi> Truly (beloved) I would to God a Minister might not have just cause to say so in this point, that when hee commeth, and reades this of the Apostle; <hi>It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines (brethren) that hee that hath a wife, bee as if hee had none; hee that useth the world, as not abusing it: and hee that buyeth, as if hee pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed not,</hi> &amp;c. And must it be thus, if wee meane to be Christians?. I would to God (I say) a man might not breake out, and say; <hi>Oh Paul, either thou art not the writer of this, or wee are no Christians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee talke and professe it in words, that we purpose to doe it:
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:14764:123"/>
but if wee come to the deed, and the truth, it is cleane contrary, wee are not at all moderate in the use of these things. In matters of Heaven, and in things that concerne our everlasting welfare, where God would have <hi>us take the kingdome of heaven with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:</hi> Where wee should cry out as the <hi>Horse-leach his daughter; Give, give, and never say it is enough:</hi> Wee are even like children that goe to schoole, that care not how little they have for their money. In hearing, if the Sermon bee but halfe an houre, wee thinke it enough: and in prayer, and in conference, a little will serve the turne. Like the Jesuit, that when he thought he had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, he cryed out, <hi>Satis Domine, Enough Lord;</hi> I have revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough: So wee, in matters of religion, <hi>Enough Lord.</hi> But turne us to wives, to children, to clothes, to honours, to prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to riches, to ease, to pleasures, and the like; there wee are as the barren wombe, that never saith it is enough. Brethren, is it not thus?</p>
                  <p>But me thinkes I should bring you some particular instances to <note place="margin">Particular instances.</note> convince you that it is thus: and I would to the Lord I could throughly convince you of it, that thus it is with you. But to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance a little. Suppose now, a man comes and meets with a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen in his businesse, and say to him; How have you spent this day? Truly (he will say) I am so full of businesse, that I have not time so much as to eat my meat. But I hope, you have beene at prayer in your family, have you not? Alas (will hee say) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get so much as a quarter of an houres time. Doe you call this as if not, brethren? Come to another, that hath a wife: all his care is for her: oh my wife and children, if I should die, and leave them poore, what should I doe? when I sleepe, I dreame of them; when I awake in the morning, my thoughts are of them. Is this to be as if you had no wife and children? Another, hee is ever a complaining and mourning, oh, I have such crosses, I am so full of afflictions; I have lost such, and such friends; and such, and such an estate: and though I goe to Church and heare, such and such comfortable doctrines, one after another, and all telling me, of the all-sufficiency of God, of the comforts and joyes of the Spirit, of the good things that are layed up in Heaven: yet like <hi>Rachel, they will never bee comforted for their brother, for their sister, for their children,</hi> &amp;c. What shall we say to these things? Doe you thinke the Lord speakes not as he meaneth? or that the Apostle, when he saith here absolutely and determinatly, that thus and thus you must doe if you be Christians, if you be <hi>brethren?</hi> Shall wee doe the contrary to all this, and yet thinke that all will bee well?</p>
                  <p>I know you may put it off (many of you) and alledge many things: wee have callings. and wee must follow our Callings: if
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:14764:123"/>
God brings me in imployment, blame me not if I follow it: And I know not how to live, if I doe not doe thus and thus.</p>
                  <p>But be not deceived, God is not mocked. In a word therefore, <note place="margin">How to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we use the things of the world, as if wee used them not.</note> to put you on the tryall. If thou findest in the middest of thy trading, and merchandizing, or whatsoever calling thou art of, thy heart daily gathering towards heaven: that thou canst say, blessed be God for this, and other commodities, but Christ is my darling: this is good. And then, in these things, if thou hast a care to use them aright, as well as to get them, and to thanke God for them, and that thy project is, how thou shalt doe good with that thou hast, that thou art alwayes saying with thy selfe, Lord how shall I doe good with so much as I have got by such a bargaine. God forbid I should say against thee, though thou bee full of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse from morning to evening. But alas, there are many good people and godly, that give hope that they serve God, yet if they goe home and examine themselves throughly, their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences will tell them, that in the things of this world, they are not, as if not, but rather, that they have beene over-carefull, and too full of distractions in businesses.</p>
                  <p>And so for matter of joy: if a man have a little pleasure, or preferment given him; his heart is so up, that hee knowes not where he is, hee is so transported, that he hath cleane forgot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. This cannot stand, this is not to be, as if not: and therefore I beseech you in the feare of God thinke of it.</p>
                  <p>Now if a man would know, how hee should come to have his <note place="margin">How a man may come to use things, as if he used them not.</note> heart in a good temper, to bee in these things, as if not. In one word, let me tell you that rule of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> In all things bee filled with the Spirit, and then thou wilt not take thought much for other things: if once you let your soules bee filled with the things of a better life: then wife, and children, and wealth, and pleasures, or any thing else, will not draw away your heart.</p>
                  <p>Get a good hand-fast of Jesus Christ: worke out your salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that you may know that you are beleevers upon good grounds, and that you have the graces of the Spirit of God in you, in deed, and in truth, that you are new creatures.</p>
                  <p>And then often thinke of the rare things that are provided for you in another life. What; to have God to bee your Father, and Angels your keepers, to be children, to bee the companions of Angels. Weigh these things daily, and then you will be, as if not, in all these outward and worldly things. And untill thou dost this: and thinkest withall of that I have formerly said, that thou art ready to strike sayle, I will never beleeve that thou wilt bee, as if not. This is the second thing.</p>
                  <p>A word or two of the Third, and so I have done. And that is the <hi>Spurre</hi> that the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> useth. And it is necessary
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:14764:124"/>
hee should use such a spurre, for it is a very hard lesson.</p>
                  <p>If you would be, as if you were not, consider this; <hi>The fashion of the world passeth away.</hi> That is, it signifieth (I touched it before) such a fashion as is on a stage: All these things below, they are but as the Acting of a Comedie, as a Scaene, it may bee it is done in halfe an houre, and though it make a fine shew, yet in truth there is no substance in it.</p>
                  <p>There is one, <hi>it is a fashion:</hi> besides, <hi>it passeth away.</hi> So then in this spurre, there are two things. I will but name the heads. <note place="margin">3. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Motive, or spurre. <hi>Obser.</hi> 1. The things of the world, but a shew without a substance.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That the things of this world</hi> (all, that I named before) <hi>are but a shew without a substance;</hi> Even as a Scaene or Comedie, things that have a glorious glittering shew to the eye, but if you looke in deed and in truth upon them, there is no such matter. That is one thing that I note, that our life is but as the acting of a part in a Comedie: and so by consequence, in all these outward things, thy contentment in wife, or children, or credit, or pleasures, thou dost but act a glorious part, it may be thou hast a goodly outside, fine clothes, rich apparell, an outward representation of comfort, but looke thorow them, and there is no such matter.</p>
                  <p>But the second thing which I rather would presse, is, <hi>that it is</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obser.</hi> 2. The shew of the world is suddenly gone.</note> 
                     <hi>suddenly gone;</hi> it passeth away, saith the Apostle. As a man hath but a little time to tarry in the world, so all the things hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth in the world, are wondrous inconstant. That looke as it is in a Play, hee that now acts the part of a King, it may be next, he may act the part of a Begger: or as it is with some of your deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate fashions, that while you are speaking of them, the fashion is spoyled. Even so, the fashion of this world it will not continue.</p>
                  <p>That is the summe of that I desire you to take notice of: that if you will not be perswaded by me, or by the Spirit of God in his unworthy minister, to use the things of this world moderately, and to carry your selves as you ought in crosses and afflictions: yet know this, that <hi>the fashion of these things</hi> will shortly be spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And if they be all so unconstant, what a foole art thou to set thy heart upon them?</p>
                  <p>Wee may learne this wisedome from the foolery of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Nation, esteemed now the idlest people of the world for changing their fashion. They will never make clothes twice of one fashion, but one gowne of this fashion, and another of that, and though he bee never so good a Taylour that makes it, yet hee must make no more of the same fashion, but the next Terme, they will cometo another. Learne, I say, this wisedome from that foolery: Now, the Lord giveth thee comfort in thy wife, set not thy heart too much upon her, the next Terme the fashion may change: Now, thou art rich, let not thy heart dote upon thy ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, it is but a fashion, a shew, it passeth away, to morrow
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:14764:124"/>
thou maist bee a begger: to day a man, to morrow none.</p>
                  <p>But if thou wouldest keepe the fashion, get the fashion of grace, get a right to heaven, an interest in God, and be content (in Gods name) to follow his fashion. If the fashion that God will have thee be in, be to be an humble dejected man, be content with that fashion: if anon he will have thee on the toppe of the wheele of prosperitie, thanke God for it, take heed of abusing the things thou enjoyest. Remember the things of this life are inconstant things; as a flower, as a nosegay, that seemeth as a dainty fine thing, but while we are smelling at it, and praising it, it withereth away: so is it with all these things.</p>
                  <p>I would I could tell how to speake home to your soules: and yet I know that little I have spoken, if it be entertained with faith, if you beleeve this to be the truth of God, not as the speech that a man makes to you, but as the speech of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> an Apostle of Christ, that sets it downe by the direction of God, that it is thus: I say, if you lay downe this as a truth that comes from God, and seriously thinke with your selves; I have but a little time to tarry here below, and when I am out of the world, I shall live for ever in heaven or in hell: while I doe enjoy the things of this world, God will have me to be, as if not, in them: and there is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why, they are shewes, and not substances: Grace and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <note place="margin">Grace is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note> of God is only that which is substantiall, whatsoever you looke upon that is under these, are but shewes: riches, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and worldly contentments they are but shadowes, like one in a play, that is but a Peasant under the coat of a King, these have but only outsides, under them there is no such matter. This I say which I have spoken, being seriously considered, and faithfully received, may (through the blessing of GOD, and your owne prayers to God to teach you this) be a meanes to moderate you in the use of all those things that are here below.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the beginning of this Chapter, hee prevents an objection that some might make. For, having fallen upon the discourse of the Resurrection, hee well knew the curiositie of mans nature, that leaves those things that are most profitable, to enquire after such things that God hath hid, and therfore some men might say; Since there shall be such a time, and such a change; when will those

times and seasons be? When shall that great day of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction come, when all shall bee brought together?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of the times and seasons brethren</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>yee have no need that I write unto you,</hi> verse 1. As if hee should say: this is no needfull, no necessarie thing for you to enquire into, or for mee to tell you: rather let us fall upon those things that are necessarie and usefull; for neither you, nor I, can tell the particular time when that shall be: yet know this, that very suddenly such a time shall come, and that when the world least thinkes of it.</p>
                  <p>The suddennesse hereof, he setteth downe by a twofold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.</p>

                  <p>It were happy for wicked and ungodly men, if there should be such a <hi>destruction</hi> of their beeing, as that they should cease to bee any more: for then this body, the members whereof have beene the servants of sinne, should not be tormented in Hell: and then this Soule of theirs, that hath set all the body on worke in the service of sinne, it should not be sensible of that anguish that shall cause <hi>gnashing of teeth.</hi> It were well (I say) for them if there

And beside this, that same chearefulnesse of spirrit, and that free disposition, whereby they incouraged themselves in the wayes of their pride, or whatsoever else it was, that made them seeme some body on earth; all this shall cease, and faile them, and forsake them.

                  <p>So then the meaning of the words are, as if the Apostle should have said; When wicked and ungodly men, in a course of sinne shall <hi>crie peace to themselves,</hi> and flatter themselves in their rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous courses, then shall a <hi>sudden, a painfull, an inevitable destruction,</hi> of all their comfort of all their props, and hopes, and helpes, fall upon them.</p>
                  <p>In the words, you have a twofold description. <note place="margin">In the words a double de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription. 1 Zach. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>First of the state and condition of the men of the world, when Christ shall come to Iudgement.</hi> Hee shall find all the world at rest. As <hi>the Angell that stood among the myrtle trees,</hi> spake in the 1 <hi>Zachar.</hi> 11. <hi>Wee have walked to and fro through the earth: and behold all the earth
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:14764:128"/>
sitteth still, and is at rest.</hi> Hee shall find all the men of the world in peace: every man applauding himselfe in some vaine conceit, in some hope and confidence or other. <hi>They shall cry peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, here is the consequent that followeth upon the <note place="margin">2</note> vaine flatterie of themselves: <hi>Then shall destruction come upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that destruction is farther described and amplified by a comparison taken from a <hi>woman with childe,</hi> to declare the <hi>suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> the <hi>painfulnesse,</hi> the <hi>unavoidablenesse</hi> of it. Thus you have the opening of the words.</p>
                  <p>Let us now come to the points of instruction that may be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed hence.</p>
                  <p>First, here you may see, and he that runnes may read it, that</p>
                  <p>They are most secure, that are in least safetie. <note place="margin">The Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note>

                  <p>This is the very thing that the holy Ghost would have us to take notice of here: <hi>At that very time,</hi> not before that time, <hi>they shall crie peace:</hi> Nor after the time, when they had done it, and repented of it: But just at the very time, when they are in the middest of their sinnes, applauding of their owne estate, living under the power and guilt of sinne, then <hi>commeth destruction upon them, and they shall not escape.</hi> Thus farre the text.</p>
                  <p>That we may make the point cleare, before wee come to prove it, give me leave, first briefly to tell you what wee meane by that securitie, which is upon men even in their chiefest dangers.</p>
                  <p>Know therefore, that there is a twofold securitie; <note place="margin">A double se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <list>
                        <item>A holy, spirituall</item>
                        <item>A sinfull, carnall</item>
                     </list> securitie.</p>
                  <p>There is first, a holy and spirituall securitie (and that even in <note place="margin">1. Holy and spirituall.</note> this state whereinto wee are fallen) which consisteth in a mans reconciliation with God, when hee is in termes of peace with him, having obtained remission of his sinnes, and his favour through Jesus Christ; so that God is pleased with him in his Son, hath received him into the Covenant of grace, interested him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the promises, and is become his God by a Covenant for ever. Now here a man may be secure, yea, and hee must bee so in a spirituall manner. Confidence upon the goodnesse of God in Christ, upon the promises of God in the Gospell, is that which is requisite in every Christian: it is that which God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; <hi>Feare not</hi> (saith he in one place.) And againe, <hi>Trust in the Lord.</hi> The Scripture is full in a calling for such securitie as this; that men should lay aside all those carking, and distracting cares,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:14764:128"/>
when once they are in the Covenant of grace, that now they should mind nothing but duty, and not bee troubled about successe.</p>
                  <p>For (my brethren) it is such a security as makes a man not to <note place="margin">Spirituall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, what.</note> neglect duty; but such, as freeth a man from those disquiets of soule about the event of things. This was that which <hi>David</hi> had, and rejoyced in; <hi>I laid mee downe in rest and peace, for the Lord keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 4. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>mee in safetie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is that which the Lord commanded the people of Israel to doe; <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 20. <hi>Come my people, enter thou into thy chamber, and shut</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 26. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>thy dores about thee, hide thy selfe, &amp;c.</hi> Hee would have them secure themselves under his protection, and in his ordinances.</p>
                  <p>This is such a securitie, as draweth men neerer to God, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to further acquaintance with God, keepeth them in a constant communion with God, causeth them to walke in Gods presence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is a good security.</p>
                  <p>But then secondly, there is a sinfull carnall security; that is, <note place="margin">2. Sinf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ll and carnall.</note> when a man yet living in a course of sinne, hee beareth up his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit against all feare, either of judgements threatned, or judgements approaching upon him, under a vaine hope, of I know not what, mercy in God: and of I know not what, assurance from men, and upon worldly conceits and flatteries, either from others, or his owne heart. Here is now a sinfull carnall securitie, not warranted, but condemned in the word of God. This is the security, that is ever an ill prognosticator, and fore-runner of some heavy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to fall upon that person in whom it is. This is the security that we have now in chase.</p>
                  <p>First then, wee will make it appeare, that it is an infallible signe <note place="margin">Carnall secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of Judgement.</note> of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Nay, marke the answer of God (verse 20.) <hi>Thou foole, this night thy soule shall bee taken from thee; then whose shall those things bee, that thou hast provided?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ordinary (as <hi>Iob</hi> noteth of worldly men) thus to flatter themselves: <hi>They spend their dayes in wealth, and in a moment got</hi>

                  <p>Yee shall have Jerusalem in the same case. Their Prophets are flattering them, and crying, peace, peace, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> tells them, Chap. 6. 14, 15. <hi>They heale the hurt of the daughter of my people slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>

                     <hi>saying, peace, peace, when there is no peace. Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? Nay, they were not ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among men that fall, at the time that I visit them, they shall bee cast downe, saith the Lord.</hi> Marke; The Prophets cry peace; It had beene well done of the Prophets to cry peace to those Israelites, that in truth were at peace with God: but they cry peace to them, to whom there was no peace. What then? Did the people reforme? did this make those that before were rebellious against God, come in, and accept of the conditions of peace, and forsake their sinnes, and turne to God?
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:14764:129"/>
No such matter, nay though their sinnes were reproved by <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> and other faithfull Prophets, <hi>yet they were not ashamed, when they had committed abomination, and they could not blush;</hi> they stood it out, they remained in their impenitency. Well; what of this? <hi>Therefore</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>they shall fall amongst them that fall, in that day, at that time, they shall be destroyed, they shall bee cast downe,</hi> they shall cease to be a people; at least, they shall cease to be men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing above other people.</p>
                  <p>In the first of <hi>Zephaniah,</hi> vers. 12. yee have the Lord saying <note place="margin">Zepha. 1. 12.</note> there, that <hi>he will visit Ierusalem with lights, and search it with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles.</hi> What to doe? <hi>to find out the men that are frozen on their dregges, that are settled on their lees; that say in their heart, the Lord will not doe good, neither will hee doe evill.</hi> Why will the Lord visit <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with lights, to find out these men? Hee meeteth with the conceit, that such men as these have, they thinke (as the Atheists in <hi>Iob) that God is circled in the clouds,</hi> and seeth not the things below, or as those in this Prophesie of <hi>Zephanie,</hi> that said, <hi>The Lord sees not; neither doth hee regard.</hi> Why doth he not so? Because hee wants light. Well then (saith the Lord) I will bring candles to see with, and visit <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with lights: and whosoever hee spies out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all the sinners in Israel, hee will be sure to meet with those that say, <hi>The Lord sees not; that are settled on their dregges,</hi> that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themselves under false perswasions, they shall not escape his wrath; Gods greatest quarrell is against those men that flatter themselves, as if God did not take notice of their sinnes, hee will surely punish those: it is for their sakes, why hee will bring can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles to search <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with.</p>
                  <p>It was so with <hi>Babylon,</hi> in <hi>Isa.</hi> 47. 8. 9. The Lord observeth <note place="margin">Isa. 47. 8. 9.</note> her boasting; <hi>I am</hi> (saith shee) <hi>a Queene, I sit as a Lady, I shall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther see losse of children, nor widowhood.</hi> Marke now what God saith, <hi>Heare now this, thou that art given to pleasures, and dwellest carelesly, both these shall come upon thee, losse of children, and widowhood;</hi> all thy props, and all thy staies shall bee taken from thee, yea, and that in one day, in a moment, when thou least thinkest of it, suddenly thou shalt be husbandlesse, and childlesse.</p>
                  <p>Nay, it is that which the Lord speakes of Romish Babylon in the 18 <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. Shee had heard of the pride and boasting of old <note place="margin">Rev. 18. 7.</note>

Well, what will the Lord doe? <hi>Therefore</hi> (verse 8.) <hi>shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine, and shee shall bee utterly burnt with fire, for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</hi> Thou saist I sit as a Lady, I shall see no change.

                  <p>And it must be so, and there is great reason for it. If we either <note place="margin">Confirmed by Reason.</note> consider the causes of security, whence it commeth: or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commitants that accompany it; or the fruits and events of it: it must be that great judgements must be fall men, and places, when they are under this carnall securitie.</p>
                  <p>First looke to the causes. Whence is it that men, that are not at peace with God, yet flatter themselves that they shall doe <note place="margin">1. In respect of the causes of security. Infidelity.</note> well? It proceedeth from that unbeliefe, and infidelity, that is in the hearts of men: therefore they flatter themselves, and pride themselves in things that will not hold them up in the end: I say infidelity is the cause that men are so secure.</p>
                  <p>Did men beleeve the word of God, that every threatning that goeth out of the mouth of God, against any particular sinne, should certainly fall upon the head of the sinner, durst they goe on in a course of sinning against God? Durst they adde drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to thirst? one wickednesse to another? No certainly. In that measure a man hath faith; in that measure he feareth God and his judgements that hee hath threatned.</p>
                  <p>See it in <hi>Noah,</hi> Heb. 11. <hi>By faith Noah being warned of God, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>with feare, prepared an Arke.</hi> Hee beleeved that God was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that had threatned a judgement upon the world: he beleeved the word of God, that commanded him to provide an Arke for the safetie of him and his house, and therefore hee feared the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge to come, and prepared an Arke.</p>
                  <p>So likewise <hi>Iosiah,</hi> when he read the booke of the Law, and saw what was threatned against the sinnes of the people, <hi>his heart melted within him:</hi> and why? because hee beleeved that this was the word of God, he beleeved that God would be as true as his
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:14764:130"/>
Word, therefore his heart melted within him, at the sight of those sinnes, wherein the people had continued so long a time.</p>
                  <p>Nay, it is made a description of a beleever in <hi>Isa. 61. That he is one that trembleth at Gods word.</hi> On the other side: what is the <note place="margin">Isa. 61.</note> reason why infidelity doth presently bring judgements upon men? The cause is apparant: infidelity it draweth men from God; <hi>An unbeleeving heart departs from the living God.</hi> And when <note place="margin">Heb. 3.</note> a man departs from Gods presence, God pursueth him with his judgements. All the judgements of God are upon that place; where Gods presence in his grace is not. <hi>If I goe</hi> (saith <hi>David) to the uttermost parts of the earth, thou art there: if I goe into the deepe, thou art there.</hi> And how there? Not only as an observer, but as a punisher; that is, when men come to this point, to flie from God: Now, unbeleefe is a drawing of the soule from God to the creature, therefore it provokes God, for it sets up an Idoll in the heart of man, and Idolatrie exceedingly provokes God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he bringeth judgements upon it.</p>
                  <p>Beside that, marke the threatning of the Word against this, <hi>Deut. 29. When a man heareth the words of this curse, and blesseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 29. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>and saith, I shall have peace, though I walke in the stubbornnesse of my owne heart, the Lord will not spare that man, but the anger of the Lord, and his jealousie shall smoake against him, and all the plagues that are written in this booke, shall be heaped on him.</hi> When is that? when is the time that the wrath of God shall smoake? At that very time and instant, when he flattereth himselfe with his vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, that he shall have peace though God threaten judgement, then at that very instant, the wrath of God shall fall upon such a man.</p>
                  <p>In this manner did God deale with the Israelites, in <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 9, 10. <note place="margin">Isa. 6. 9, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Make the heart of this people fat, make their eares heavy:</hi> and why so? <hi>that they may see, and not perceive; that they may heare, and not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand; lest they should be converted, and I should heale them. How long shall this be?</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>till the Cities be wasted without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When God giveth over a people to bee regardlesse in hearing the Word, that they heare and doe not hearken, they heare and doe not regard, they doe not conforme and reforme, according to the doctrine delivered, then God intendeth to sweepe them away by judgement, that they may be utterly left desolate, as the Text saith.</p>
                  <p>You see then it must needs be a grievous fore-runner of a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon a place, or Citie or people or nation, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine impenitent in their sinnes, and yet crie peace.</p>
                  <p>Againe secondly; If you marke the concommitants, what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies <note place="margin">2. In respect of the conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants of security.</note> this carnall securitie in the hearts of men, and it will
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:14764:131"/>
appeare then, that it must of necessitie bring a judgement upon a a Land and place. What is that that accompanies it? A disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion slighting of God himselfe. When a man, I say, heareth the Word, the judgements threatned: heareth the Law warning him to take heed of wrath: the Gospell alluring him to repent: and yet all moveth him not, but still hee flattereth himselfe: I say here is a disposition slighting God himselfe.</p>
                  <p>God in all his Attributes is slighted. His power, his wisedome, his justice, his truth is slighted: yea, his mercy, and patience, and <note place="margin">Disrespect of God in all his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</note> long-suffering, all are slighted, when a man in the course of sinne goeth on in carnall securitie. Especially amongst the rest, this is a slighting of Gods patience, and long-suffering, and forbearance of men.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore do men harden themselves against exhortations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but because they presume upon the continuance of Gods long-suffering toward them? Marke how the Lord takes notice <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 4. 5.</note> of this, <hi>Rom. 2. 4. The forbearance, and long-snffering, the goodnesse, and mercy of God, should lead thee to repentance;</hi> and therefore God hath for bore thee all this while, that he might bring thee to repentance. But what if hee doe not? <hi>Thou after thy hardnesse, and impenitent heart, heapest up as a treasure to thy selfe, wrath against the day of wrath.</hi> What day is that? <hi>The day of the revelation of the righteous judgement of God.</hi> As if hee should say; Now you obscure Gods justice and righteousnesse from others, and from your selves: Well, God therefore will take a time to declare his righteous judgement, for that purpose God hath a day of wrath; and thy daily going on in sinne, against the long-suffering, and patience of God, it doth but adde wrath to that day. Thus it is when God hath borne with a man his owne selfe.</p>
                  <p>So it is likewise when God warneth a man by his patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward others. What hardneth men in securitie? Doe wee not see God hath beene mercifull to many sinners, why may he not be so to me too? Hee gave them repentance after many sins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, why may he not doe so to me?</p>
                  <p>Marke what <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Eccles. 8. 11. Because sentence against an evill doer, or an evill worke, is not executed speedily, therefore the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 8. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>heart of the sonnes of men, is set in them to doe evill.</hi> This they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, they resolve upon, they venture up on: God hath beene thus and thus to others, patient and long-suffering, and why may hee not be so to them? <hi>Well yet I know</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) that it shall not goe well with them in the end, neither shall the wicked prolong his dayes;</hi> Why? <hi>because he feareth not before God.</hi> They are not awakened by the example of his judgements on others, they are not allured by his patience and long-suffering: it doth not make them to feare him: therefore it shall not goe well with them in the end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:14764:131"/>
Thirdly, Looke to the end, what the consequence of this carnal <note place="margin">3. In respect of the fruit and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of securitie.</note> securitie is; what followes upon it. Where there is carnall securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, there must of necessitie be an increase of sin, and consequently, a hastening of judgement: for the more sin hastneth to ripenesse, the more judgement hasteneth also upon the sinner. God hath set unto particular men a certaine stint, and it is not knowne to them, what that stint limited is. <hi>Gen. 15. 16. The iniquitie of the Amorites,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>is not yet full.</hi> They were a sinfull people at that time: but the neerer they came to that fulnesse, and stint, and limitation that God intended to be the immediate fore-runner of the judgement, the faster judgement hastned upon them. So for particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, there is a certaine stint limited (Let every man looke to it.) The adding of one sinne more, may be thy uttermost stint, that shall bring the last stroke of judgement, and destruction upon <note place="margin">Note.</note> thee. Now (I say) this carnall securitie is that, that increaseth sinne upon a man. Wee know how the securitie of the Israelites increased their sinne upon them. And the securitie of <hi>Sodome, their pride, and idlenesse,</hi> increased the rest of their sinnes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently hastned on their judgement. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. when <hi>there was no feare of God before their eyes;</hi> when there was a neglect of that, there was abundance of wickednesse amongst them: and what followes? <hi>then there was nothing but destruction, and calamitie in all their wayes.</hi> I could give you sundrie instances of this in the word of God. But I hasten.</p>
                  <p>You see the reason. Let us now come to make some use of it, that we may not be prevented.</p>
                  <p>Wee have told you, that it is true of States and Kingdomes, of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. For examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> particular persons, of every man, that when in a course of sinne, and impenitencie, they cry peace to themselves, then judgement and destruction is comming upon them. It serveth therefore to informe us, what to thinke of our selves, of the estate of this Land wherein wee live: of these times wherein we are fallen.</p>
                  <p>What can we expect, when we consider to what a height of sinne wee are come; how impenitent men are: how obstinate and hard-hearted, and stiff-necked against the voyce of God in the Gospell, and the meanes of Grace; but destruction to come upon us?</p>
                  <p>If we looke upon the sinnes of men, wee may perceive even a generall ripenesse for judgement. When the sinnes of the <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> were full, Judgement came upon them. How neere the sinnes of this Land are come to that fulnesse, wee know not, wee have cause to feare. Wee see in other Countreys the shaking of the sword upon us: it hath not yet awakened us to feare God. At home, wee have had the voyce of the Prophets, the Ministers crying unto us from day to day, to returne, lest destruction come
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:14764:132"/>
upon us: it hath not brought us to returne from our sinnes. Wee have seene the mercies of God upon particular persons, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: it hath not awakened men to walke conscionably in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Wee see no reformation, there is rather an increase of sinne. And what can we expect there wants? but one sinne, and when that is come, sudden destruction commeth. What is that? Securitie.</p>
                  <p>And have wee not cause to bewaile the generall securitie that is amongst us? May not the <hi>Angell of the Lord</hi> returne that answer, as hee did in the first of <hi>Zephany; All the world is at rest?</hi> Goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the streets, the houses, the shops of men, every man is at rest: no man is troubled about his estate, nor affected with Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, either against himselfe, or the Land wee live in. See, is not the Land as secure as they of <hi>Laish,</hi> or worse? They were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, because they did not heare of the danger; of the purpose of the Danites against them: therefore their securitie was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether so culpable and blame-worthy. But I will tell you what securitie ours is: nay, the holy Ghost hath told us to our hands, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 34. That judgement there, that is threatned against a man that goeth on in sinne, seemes to bee a judgement executed upon us at this time: <hi>Thou shalt be as a man that lies downe in the middest of the sea, or as hee that lies upon the top of a must. They have striken mee, shalt thou say, and I was not sicke: they have beaten mee, and I felt it not, when I awake, I will seeke it yet againe.</hi> Our security, I say, is like that of <hi>a man in the middest of the sea,</hi> and yet asleepe: <hi>as a man upon the top of a mast,</hi> and yet asleepe. Nay, men not only in danger, but such as have the stroke upon them: <hi>They have striken mee, and I was not sicke; they have wounded me, and I felt it not.</hi> Is it not thus with us, in these dead and secure times that wee live in? And shall wee say that wee are not asleepe? Hath not the Lord sent the destroying Angell amongst us, that hath smitten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands in our streets? and yet we have not felt it. Shall we say we are not in danger? <hi>Wee are as a man that sleepeth on the top of a mast</hi> at Sea: Nay, as a man in the middest of the waves, in a dead sleep, like such as are drunke, and yet wee feele nothing. Truly we have little cause to be secure, we have little cause to flatter our selves with vaine conceits of peace, and continuance of prosperity, if wee looke well about us. Where is any man that takes occasion by what he heares abroad, or sees at home, to enter into the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his owne house, of his owne heart?</p>
                  <p>It may be some men will say; It is an unjust tax that you put upon us; wee are not so secure as you speake of. You shall scarse come to any mans table, but they will bee talking of the judgements abroad. You shall scarse meet a man in the streets, but hee will leave other occasions, and tell you how ill it goes with the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:14764:132"/>
Churches beyond the Seas. You shall scarse meet with one in the field, but all the time is tooke up with discourse of the evils at home, or troubles abroad. And is this a signe of security?</p>
                  <p>Alas (beloved) this is to bee asleepe, in the middest of the waves. Every man is in the middest of danger, and yet is secure.</p>
                  <p>How shall that appeare?</p>
                  <p>I will make it appeare, by demonstrations and signes, that may convince you before the Lord, that wee adde this to the rest of our sinnes, that in the middest of our sinnes and impenitency, we are secure: and therefore that destruction is comming upon us.</p>
                  <p>What are the signes whereby wee may bee convinced of securitie?</p>
                  <p>I will give you a few, that by those you may see whether the Land, the Citie, your families, your selves, and all be not asleepe, <note place="margin">Signes of security.</note> and at rest this day.</p>
                  <p>The first signe shall be this; When men profit not by the judgements of God. Certainly it is an evident signe of a deepe <note place="margin">1. Profiting not by the judgements of God on our selves, or others.</note> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>eepe in sinne, when neither the afflictions that are upon others, or upon our selves, doe any good upon us.</p>
                  <p>Looke how God hath smitten others. Hath that awakned us? You will say that it is a secure child that seeth his brother beaten, for the same fault before his eyes, and yet goeth on in it; you will say that that is a secure malefactour, that seeth such a person exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted before his face, and yet goeth on in the same fellony and theft. And must we not say that we are a secure generation, when we can see our brethren in other Countreys, how they have suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and yet goe on in the very same sinnes, that wee our selves thinke the hand of God is upon them for? We can talke of their sinnes, of their unrighteousnesse, and injustice, wee can talke of their neglect of the Lords day, and other holy duties, and for these wee judge them smitten of God. How is it then that we are such our selves? how is it, that wee goe on in unrighteousnesse, in prophaning the Lords day, in neglecting the house of God, and our owne families? Have they found such sweetnesse in these sinnes, that wee walke on in the same? Is it a pleasant and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable thing to be driven from Gods house, and from our owne houses? to be a reproach to all the world? If we thinke that the hand of God is upon them for these sinnes, how is it that wee are not awakened? I remember <hi>Daniel</hi> in the fifth Chapter of his prophesie, taxeth <hi>Belshazzar</hi> for this: <hi>though thou knowest</hi> (saith he) <note place="margin">Dan. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the hand of God was upon thy father, for this and this, yet thou hast done the like, and hast not humbled thy heart.</hi> So may I say; You have knowne what God hath done to your brethren in other countries, yet you doe still the same your selves, for the which they have beene punished. Is not this security?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:14764:133"/>
Looke likewise upon our selves, and wee shall see a generall neglect of those judgements of God, that have beene upon our selves. How hath God smitten this Land? this Citie especially with the Pestilence? and may we not say, wee have beene smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and yet have not felt it? is not this securitie, and a dead sleep? God threatneth those in <hi>Ier. 31. 9. That escaped the pestilence, that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 31. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>they should fall by the sword, by the hand of Nebuchadnezar:</hi> Why so? because they did not reforme, and amend by the pestilence. What cause have we then to feare, lest wee fall into the hands of the sword of some <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> or other, when the pestilence hath done no more good among us, when it hath not awakened, and reformed us? Looke upon your selves, upon your houses, upon your dealings, your company, your conversations; see if there be any reformation, since there was such a mortall calamitie, as drove you from the Citie, and frighted you from your owne houses, and from the house of God.</p>
                  <p>Well: these are fearfull prefages, that when former Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prevaile not, worser are a comming. <hi>I have smittenthem</hi> (saith God in the fourth of <hi>Amos) with cleannesse of teeth, and yet they have not returned unto me:</hi> What then? <hi>I have smitten them with blasting</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Amos 4.</note> 
                     <hi>and mildew, and yet they have not returned unto mee:</hi> What then? <hi>I have smitten them with the pestilence, after the manner of Egypt, and yet they have not returned unto mee:</hi> What then? <hi>Therefore I will come against them; and because I will doe this, prepare to meet thy God, Oh Israel.</hi> As if hee should say; I have now stood out, and tried you, at one or two weapons, and found you obstinate and rebellious: I have stroke at you with the sword of Famine; I have shot at you the Arrowes of pestilence; I have smitten you with other judgements. You should now meet me: if not, I have more wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons yet; I will come and bid the battell against you, and it shall appeare who is the stronger, you or I: And since you will stand out against me, notwithstanding the Judgements executed upon others, and afflictions upon your selves, see if you can stand out against my last stroke: you have escaped some lesser sicknesses up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your owne bodies; you have escaped the Pestilence already; but you shall find it a hard taske, when God biddeth battell, to escape his last stroke, if you will not now be reconciled, and come in, and seeke his face. This is the first demonstration, whereby it appeares, that we are sinfully secure, which is a fore-runner of Judgement, because we are not awakened by the judgements of God upon our selves and others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another signe is this; The contempt of Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: <note place="margin">2. Contempt of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</note> the slighting of the Prophets. This is an evident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration that wee are under this carnall security I now speake of.</p>
                  <p>Marke how the Lord describeth a people whom he meaneth to
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:14764:133"/>
destroy, <hi>Zach. 7. 11, 12. They refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their eares, that they should not heare: Yea, they made their hearts as an Adamant stone, lest they should heare the Law, and the words which the Lord of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of hosts.</hi> A great wrath, what is that? <hi>Therefore</hi> (vers. 13.) <hi>it is come to passe, that as Heecryed, and they would not heare, so they cryed, and I would not heare, saith the Lord of hosts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well (beloved) little doe you know what time, and wayes God hath to make you cry, and roare in the anguish of your hearts, because of Judgements and afflictions, when you will not now heare God, that striveth with you, and cries unto you with the voyce of his Spirit in his Prophets from day to day. When men will not heare God speaking to them in his Word, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a fore-runner of judgement. In the sixth of <hi>Amos,</hi> the <note place="margin">Amos 6.</note> Lord challengeth his people, and telleth them, that hee had used many meanes for their reclaiming, but nothing would doe them good: well now (saith he) <hi>heare the rod, and him that hath appointed it:</hi> As if hee should say: there is no more dealing with you with the Word, but I must come with the rod, with judgement. Is it not thus with us at this day? May not the Lord say of us, as hee did of the people in <hi>Ieremies</hi> time? <hi>You have forsaken my law which</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 9. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>I set before you, and have not obeyed my voyce, neither walked therein, but have walked after the imaginations of your owne heart.</hi> And then what followes? <hi>Therefore, thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, I will feed this people with wormewood, and give them water of gall to drinke, and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doe not many cry out, as they in <hi>Ier. 23. 33. What is the burthen</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 23. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>of the Lord?</hi> Where is it that the Ministers have not beene threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning judgement, and telling you that God is comming out to bee avenged upon a sinfull nation? have they not beene crying thus this seven, ten, twentie yeares? Where is that burthen of the Lord? Well, you shall find what it is, when the day of the Lord commeth, a day of blacknesse and terrour: it hasteneth: and this very security is an evident signe thereof: even as in the dayes of <hi>Noah that preacher of righteousnesse:</hi> and in the dayes of <hi>Lot, that vexed his soule with the uncleane conversation of the Sodomites;</hi> they would not beleeve their words, but <hi>they seemed unto them, as if they mocked;</hi> and then came the judgement of the Lord upon them.</p>
                  <p>If this bee not the estate of this Land at this day, what meanes the complaints, the heavinesse of the spirits of the Prophets? What meanes their teares and cries, and prayers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the obstinacie, and hard-heartednesse of people that will not be drawne from their sinnes by any meanes? This is a second
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:14764:134"/>
evidence or signe, when all this crying and calling will not awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that we are in a deepe sleepe of security.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, another evidence is, the vaine hopes of this Land. <note place="margin">3. Vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</note> It is a signe of carnall security, and that we are all in a dead sleepe, when we have such idle dreames out of idle fancies, and vaine confidence that delude and deceive men.</p>
                  <p>What doe men rest on, to secure, and perswade themselves of imunitie from wrath and impunitie?</p>
                  <p>Certainly this: that we have the ordinances of God amongst us. Oh the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Alas, had not the people of Israel the Arke? and yet the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listims tooke the Arke, and slew the sonns of <hi>Eli.</hi> Had they not the Temple? and yet the Lord in <hi>Ier. 7. 11. Sendeth them to Shiloh.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jer 7. 11. 12, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Goe yee now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it, for the wickednesse of my people Israel. And now because you have done all these workes, saith the Lord, and I spake unto you rising early, and speaking, but you heard not; and I called unto you, but you answered not. Therefore will I doe to this house, which is called by my name, wherein you trust, as I have done to Shiloh.</hi> Had not the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> the golden Candlesticke? and yet are they not now tributary to the Turke? The ordinances of God (beloved) are meanes to increase, and hasten a judgement, when we shut our eyes, and will not open them, but walke in darknesse.</p>
                  <p>Oh but there was never so many Preachers, nor so many meanes: there seemes to be a new spring of the Gospell: there are abundance of men that come daily furnished for the Ministery, and are zealous and forward, and powerfull Prophets, and the like: and therefore it is a signe that much good is intended towards us, and that no judgement shall come.</p>
                  <p>But doe we not reade that immediatly before the seventy years captivity, there were more Prophets then in many yeares before? Why should we rest in such things as these?</p>
                  <p>But neverthelesse we have many good people that are full of prayers and teares, and they shall deliver the Island.</p>
                  <p>It is true, there are many (blessed be God) and we have cause to wish that there were many more: and to say as <hi>Moses</hi> said to <hi>Ioshua,</hi> when he would have had him forbid <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad,</hi> that <note place="margin">Numb. 11. 13</note> prophesied in the Campe of the Israelites; <hi>Would God that all the Lords people were Prophets, and that hee would put his Spirit upon them.</hi> So wee, of such godly men that walke with an upright heart: would God that there were many such. But yet are not these as <hi>Lillies</hi> among thornes? a few amongst many men? Are not these the objects of reproach, and contempt amongst an unrighteous generation? Who are the men that are cryed downe most by the world, that are most opposed, and injured by all men?
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:14764:134"/>
Are not these they that support the land by their prayers, and hold up all by their standing in the gappe? May wee not rather feare that God will avenge the quarrell of his servants upon an ungracious, and ungratetull people they live amongst?</p>
                  <p>What shall wee speake of other things? Did not <hi>Bozrah</hi> in <hi>Ier.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 49. 16.</note> 49. 16. boast her selfe of her scituation, <hi>that shee dwelt in the clefts of a rocke?</hi> Saith God; <hi>though thou hidest thy selfe in the clefts of the rock, though thou shouldest make thy nest, as high as the Eagle, I will bring thee downe from thence.</hi> It is not talking that our Island is sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate in the Sea, and environed with walls: Judgement can leape over the Sea, as well as the pestilence hath done our walled Townes. It is a vaine thing, and yet if you hearken to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of most men, you shall see that this is that that keepes them secure.</p>
                  <p>Or it may be, as some in <hi>Isa. 48. 15. Wee</hi> (say they) <hi>have made a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 48. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>covenant with death, and with hell are wee at agreement, when the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing scourge shall passe thorow it, shall not come unto us.</hi> Well (saith the Lord) <hi>your covenant with death shall bee disanulled, and your agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with hell shall not stand, when the overflowing scourge shall passe thorow, then you shall bee trodden downe by it:</hi> When judgement commeth, of all the people in the world it shall certainly meet with you.</p>
                  <p>What meane these idle dreames, and vaine conceits, that when we goe on in an unreformed condition, and in a course of sinne and impenitency: yet because you have the Ministers, and the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and the people of God amongst us, because we are conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for scituation, and such like things. These are vaine things, they will doe us no good at that time: and for the present, they shew our securitie, our horrible security.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, take another evidence, and that is, the abounding of <note place="margin">4. Continual increase of sinne.</note> the sinnes of the Land. Were it possible that at such a time as this, of shaking the Rod, the Sword over us, when judgements are upon the Nation, that there should be such abundance of iniquitie in all places, if men were not in a dead sleepe? How doth drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse stagger, and reele in every street? How doth pride vaunt, and boast it selfe in every Church and assembly, though it be cryed downe never so much? Alas (beloved) are these times to pride up our selves in vanitie? Are these times to runne after the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall, and sinfull courses of an ungodly generation? These are times wherein God calleth for fasting, and brokennesse of heart. <hi>Lay aside thy fine apparell</hi> (saith God to the people) <hi>that I may know what to doe unto thee.</hi> Wee should lay aside these things, that wee may shew our selves to be men awake,</p>
                  <p>But men generally doe so abound in wickednesse and ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that we may rather conclude, as it is in the Revelation, that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:14764:135"/>
the time is now come too neere; He that is filthy, let him be filthy still, that is, let him goe on to the end. It is evident and apparant, that sinne is increased since the sicknesse: it is apparant that our sins are agravated, though they are daily cryed downe. And now at this time, as if we would defie God to his face, and call upon him to hasten his judgements upon our Land, upon our Families, and persons, every one strives (as it were) who shall outdare him most, in our excesses, in impenitencie, in hardning our selves in a course of sinne.</p>
                  <p>These things convince us of our security. There are many more that might be named, if the time would permit. But put these together, and they may shew us our wretchednesse. When we consider how little we have profited by Judgements: how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle we have profited by the ordinances: how full of vaine confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and idle dreames: how notwithstanding all these wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound still in wickednesse, and there is no reformation of our hearts and lives: what may wee not conclude against our selves?</p>
                  <p>If ever people were drowned in a drunken security, wee of all people under heaven are at this time. For of all people under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, we are in a manner the last: God hath spared us to the last. We have had warning by judgements inflicted upon others, for many yeares together. It hath come neerer to us by degrees: it began a farre off in <hi>Bohemia:</hi> and then in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie.</hi> The Lord would have us see how he commeth to us by degrees, by steps, that at the last we may meet him by repentance. But where is the man that yet gets out of the bed of security, that commeth out of his sleepe to meet the Lord? that comes with a broken heart to begge for forgivenesse of his sins past, and to beg for mercy for the time to come?</p>
                  <p>Well now, since it is so, that we are convinced by these signes that we are in a carnall and sinfull security: wee see then (so many <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. For xxhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> of us at least, that are children of the light, and of the day) what cause we have to be awakened, and to doe that for others, which they will not doe for themselves: to bee more earnest in prayer, more frequent in humbling our soules, for our owne sinnes and theirs, that God may lay aside, and cast away his judgements and displeasure, that either are feared, or lie upon us.</p>
                  <p>It is not a fearfull thing, that when the Lyon roareth, the beasts of the Forrests tremble; Yet the God of heaven roareth against the world at this day, and the proud hearts of men, doe not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before him? Shall the beasts of the Forrests bee afraid of the Lyon, more then the poore wormes of the earth, of the mighty God of heaven and earth? But this is the horrible Atheisme and infidelity, that is in the hearts of men, that they beleeve not Gods power and justice, nor his threatnings.</p>

                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:14764:135"/>
I beseech you let every man be exhorted, to stirre up his soule to this businesse, to awaken himselfe in his owne particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. <note place="margin">Motives to watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. 1. The watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of our enemies.</note> Consider that there are others that are awake, that may bring you sorrow enough: bee you awakened to prevent those miseries.</p>
                  <p>Sathan is awake to tempt you. <hi>Bee sober and watchfull,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Peter, for your adversary the divill, goeth about seeking whom hee</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Sathan.</note> 
                     <hi>may devoure.</hi> Sathan is busie, and watching to make you his prey, watch you therefore, that you enter not into tentation.</p>
                  <p>Your owne Corruptions are alwayes awake. The concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, <note place="margin">2. The flesh,</note> and depraved disposition of the soule, it is awake still to further every evill motion; to draw you aside by its tentations. Therefore (saith the Apostle) <hi>I beseech you abstaine, as pilgrims and strangers, from fleshly lusts, that warre against the soule.</hi> Doe as men in warre, when they know that they have a waking enemie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, they will be sure to keepe their Watch. Beloved, you cannot but know that your corruptions are awake, you may perceive it in your sleepes and dreames: take heed that you bee not found in a spirituall sleepe, that corruption prevaile not over you.</p>
                  <p>Besides these, the enemies of the Church are awake: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques are awake every where to bring men from the faith, to <note place="margin">3. Heretiques.</note> pervert the faith of many: oh be awake to prevent those.</p>
                  <p>Besides, others are awaken to ransack houses, to destroy Cities: oh be awake, that you may bee at peace with the Lord of Hosts, the God of Armies, that hath all power in his hand to keepe you safe.</p>
                  <p>Againe secondly, consider the evill of this security you are in, <note place="margin">Mot. 2. The evill of security. In it selfe a spirituall lethargie.</note> of this disposition of heart, when you cry, peace, peace, to your selves in the middest of Gods displeasure. It is an evill disease: a spirituall lethargie. That disease we know in the body, it takes a man with sleepe, and so he dieth. Oh how many are in this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall lethargie, in this deepe sleepe of sinne at this day, the Lord awaken them. It is the more dangerous, because it is a senslesse disease: A disease that takes the senses from the soule: and diseases (we know) that take away the senses, are dangerous: for it is not only a signe, that nature is overcome by the disease; but besides, it draweth men from seeking for cure. Thus it is with the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall lethargie; it shewes not only that sinne hath prevailed in the heart, that it hath overcome grace, and thereupon you have yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto it, to your pride, and covetousnesse, and vanity, as those that are subdued under a disease: but it hindreth you from seeking the meanes to escape out of it. <hi>Thou saist</hi> (saith Christ to the Church of <hi>Laodicea,) that thou art rich, and needest nothing;</hi> and that was the reason shee sought not to Christ. It is our condition: we
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:14764:136"/>
have knowledge enough, therefore we care not for the ordinances of God; Wee have faith enough, and therefore wee care not for increasing it: though none of us say thus with our tongues, yet most of us beleeve thus with our hearts. As <hi>David</hi> saith of the ungodly man, the wickednesse of the wicked saith in my heart. So may I say, the neglecting of the ordinances, the carelesnesse of men in the use of the meanes of salvation, saith in my heart, that there is abundance of securitie, that they are in a spirituall lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie that leadeth to death.</p>
                  <p>As it is an evill disease, so it causeth much evill. It is that which driveth away the Spirit of God. It is the counsell of the Apostle, <note place="margin">2. In the effects. 1. It drives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.</note> 
                     <hi>Grieve not the Spirit, quench not the Spirit:</hi> When wee neglect the motions of the Spirit, the Spirit withdraweth it selfe. Doth not your owne experience tell you this? Consider a little, what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions you have had: how God by the checks of your consciences, sometime by secret incitements, as it were a spurre upon your hearts, hath moved you to dutie, and to leave your sinnes. How have these moved you? you have had purposes it may be to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme these duties, to walke in the wayes of God, to please him in all things: the neglect of these purposes, hath driven away the Spirit, it may be God now leaveth you to finall hardnesse.</p>
                  <p>Againe, it letteth in Sathan. <hi>When the uncleane spirit is driven</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. It lets in Sathan.</note> 
                     <hi>out, hee goeth about seeking rest, and finding none, at last hee returneth from whence hee went, and findeth the house swept and garnished: and he entreth in, and bringeth seven spirits more, worse then himselfe.</hi> Alas! how many men are there, that for a fitt, in some particulars have altered their course, and have thought to become new men: yet rushing upon former occasions, and temptations to sinne, they have growne secure and carelesse, and now Sathan hath gotten stronger hold of them, with seven spirits worse.</p>
                  <p>Nay, this is that, that drives away Christ, and the comfortable influence of his Spirit in the heart. The Church in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. was <note place="margin">3. Hinders our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Christ.</note> asleepe, was in a spirituall slumber: and Christ goeth away, <hi>Shee seekes him whom her soule loved, but shee could not find him.</hi> I speake now, to those that were awake, and are now asleepe: their hearts it may be are awake: but they walke not with that watchfulnesse, and humility of spirit before the Lord as they ought: therefore now they are heavy, and destitute of the comforts of the Spirit. Well, they may thanke themselves: Christ hath hid himselfe to teach them to be more watchfull.</p>
                  <p>And, to conclude: This is the cause of positive Judgements. <note place="margin">4. Bringeth judgement positive.</note> You know what came upon the old world, and upon <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> for their securitie.</p>
                  <p>And likewise of future Judgements, it is that which casteth men from heaven to hell. <hi>That servant that saith in his heart, my</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Future.</note>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:14764:136"/>
                     <hi>Master deferreth his comming, and therefore hee eates, and drinkes with the drunken:</hi> what is the issue of it? <hi>Hee shall have his portion given him with hypocrites, where there is weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth,</hi> Mat. 24. <note place="margin">Matt. 24.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is enough (I suppose) to awaken you. Whensoever the heart of man is held downe with secure thoughts of Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, and thinkes it is at peace with God, it is an evident signe that wrath is a comming. Nay (beloved) in that measure you are in carnall securitie; in that measure you are under wrath: let that therefore be enough to awaken you: and say thus with your selves: It were better for me a great deale, to be among the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those, that complaine, and are mourning Christians; then to bee in the number of those that are full of jollity, and Joviality, that rejoyce and sport themselves, that put farre from them the evill day: I might then escape the wrath of God, as they doe. Who are they that escape wrath? See in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 9. Those that <note place="margin">Ezek. 9.</note> were awake when others slept, those that mourned, when others laughed, those that humbled themselves before God, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hardned themselves: those were the men that were <hi>marked in the forehead by the Angel,</hi> and they escaped. And in the third of <hi>Malachie; Those that feared the Lord, and thought upon his name (in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mala. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>those evill times) that spake oft one to another: there was a booke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them, and they are Gods jewels;</hi> he will be sure to keepe them safe.</p>
                  <p>But how shall wee come to be awakened? I should have told <note place="margin">Helpes to watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> you some helpes for this: I will but touch upon a few in a word.</p>
                  <p>First, I will propound sobrietie as a maine helpe. Would you <note place="margin">1. Sobrietie.</note> be watchfull, and kept from spirituall slumber, take heed that you keepe your selves sober. I speake not of sobrietie, as it is opposed to drunkennesse, though that be one thing, <hi>Bee not filled with wine,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>wherein is excesse, but bee filled with the holy Ghost,</hi> Ephes. 5. As if he should say, you cannot be filled with the holy Ghost, and with excesse of Wine: persons that take liberty in excessive drinking, certainly they are destitute of the holy Ghost, and so of life and salvation. But I meane a further sobriety; that is, as it is opposed to worldly-mindednesse. Take heed that you plunge not your selves too much in the world; and worldly pleasures and cares: for these are against the rule of sobriety. Be sober in your diet, in your apparell, in your gaining, in your spending, in your mirth, in your company, in every thing: that is, moderate your selves, and your affections in these things. A man may soone grow to such a drunkennesse, by excesse in worldly affections, that he may bee in a dead sleepe, neglecting Gods judgements, and his owne estate, as wee see men that plunge themselves in worldly businesse
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:14764:137"/>
are. It takes away the thoughts of those things that concerne our spirituall good.</p>
                  <p>I say not that you should leave off the businesse of the world: for every man must continue in the calling that God hath set him. But I say, moderate your affections to the things of the world: Doe worldly businesses with heavenly mindes, in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God: Doe them with waking hearts; to repent for the sinnes of your callings, to avoide the sinnes of your callings. And that that I say of labouring in your callings, I say of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and of every thing else; we should be watchfull and sober: as S. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>Bee sober and watch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, if you would be free from security, which is a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of judgement; be sure to keepe your selves in exercise. <note place="margin">2. Spirituall exercise.</note> A man that would keepe himselfe awake, will busie himselfe in some exercise, and imployment or other. What exercise should a Christian use? The exercise of grace, and of the duties of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Be sure to keepe your selves in the exercise of all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that God giveth you in your lives, to imploy your graces in. In difficulties and straites, exercise your faith. In provocations to anger and discontent, exercise meeknesse. In crosses and troubles, and afflictions, exercise patience. In the miseries and wants of others, whether spirituall or corporall, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise mercy. And what I say concerning grace, I say concerning duty. Keepe your selves in the exercise of prayer, and reading, and meditation, and conference, some one thing or other, some holy employment or other, that may keepe the soule waking. For I tell you, you shall find, that whensoever you let fall spirituall exercise, you will at that very instant fall into carnall securitie in some kind or other.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, would you keepe your selves from this dead sleepe of carnall security, then keepe your spirits in feare. Sorrow and <note place="margin">3. Continual feare.</note> griefe makes a man heavy; but feare keepes a man waking, when <hi>Iacob</hi> feared <hi>Esau,</hi> he kept a watch that night. <hi>Sampson</hi> feared the Philistims, and it wakened him out of his sleepe. Feare makes a man watchfull. You may perceive it in your owne experience. In that measure that the feare of God prevaileth, securitie is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled. Keepe feare therefore. Blessed is the man that feareth alwayes, but he that hardneth his heart falleth into evill. Marke how he opposeth the hardning of a mans selfe in carnall securitie, to the feare of God. Keepe your heart in a constant feare. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thus; Alas! <hi>shall I doe this thing, and sinne against God?</hi> Will not God be offended and displeased? Shall I goe on in this vanity? Would I have the judgement of God find me in this company? would I have it seise upon mee in this imployment, in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in this action? Feare lest God should strike thee in such an
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:14764:137"/>
act, lest Death should seize upon thee in such a place, and let that make thee keepe a constant watch against the snares that are in those places.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, keepe good company. Company you know is a <note place="margin">4. Good company. Eccles. 4.</note> good meanes to keepe men awake. <hi>Two are better then one, and woe to him that is alone,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon.</hi> I say good company: for there are a company that will infect you. <hi>Keepe not company with a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward person, lest thou learne his frowardnesse.</hi> So, keepe not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with drunken, and swearing persons, these are the Divels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, to keepe a man in carnall security. No, keepe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with those that have a charge given them, <hi>to exhort one another daily, and to consider one another, to provoke to love, and good workes.</hi> Keepe company with the Saints, and make use of all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to provoke others, and to be provoked by others. That is the fourth helpe.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, would you bee kept from this sinfull security: then keepe God alwayes in your sight. It is a good way for a man that <note place="margin">5. Be alwaies as in Gods presence.</note> would keepe himselfe awake, to fix his eye upon some object. Fix your eye upon this maine object, God. <hi>Whether shall I depart from thy presence,</hi> saith <hi>David,</hi> This is that the Lord would <note place="margin">Psal. 139.</note> have his people to consider, to keepe them from sinne, in <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. <note place="margin">Jer. 23. 23.</note> 23. <hi>Am I a God at hand</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>and not a God a farre off? Doe not I fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord?</hi> Can a man hide himselfe from God in any secret place? Thinke in thy chamber, in thy parlour, in thy shop, in thy house, in thy friends house, in the street, in the Church, in every place wheresoever thou art, that there God is also. If a man had but alwayes some one before him as a witnesse, he would not venture upon many things, that hee now doth. If a malefactour should see the Judge before him: if the child had alwayes his fathers eye upon him: or the servant had alwayes his Master sitting about him, and above him (though there are many that are unjust servants) yet neverthelesse hee would serve him, at least with eye-service. Now set your selves in the eye of God, that sees you in the darke: heares you in your most secret whisperings: knowes every action of your life, and every circumstance of those Actions. This will be a meanes to keepe thee from security.</p>
                  <p>I will adde but one more, which is the sixth. Consider thy lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">6. Consider thy latter end.</note> end: The night is now comming upon us. If it were told any of us, that this night thou shalt die, as it was told the rich man in <hi>Luke 12. Thou foole, this night shall they take away thy soule:</hi> I thinke there is none that heareth me this day, but hee would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly keepe waking this night. But it is not bodily waking we plead for: but spirituall waking, a waking from sinne, a waking to repentance: And we tell you that Death is now at the dore, ready
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:14764:138"/>
to seize upon you. Wee speake not only to you that are aged, that are at the brinke of the grave: but we speake also to you that are young: Death may seize upon you, and strike you this night: be awakened now to repentance. I remember what God said to the Church of <hi>Sardis; Bee watchfull, and strengthen the things that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Revel. 3. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>remaine.</hi> That Church was asleepe, as many of us are at this day. God commeth to awaken you now, as he did them, that that little goodnesse you have left, may bee renewed and confirmed. You that are quite out of the way of grace, and goe on in a course of sinne: fit now downe, and humble your soules: get into a secret corner, wherein you may confesse those many provocations whereby you have provoked God all your dayes: and resolve to amend, if the Lord spare you. Begin now, delay it no longer, it may be the last night, the everlasting night to you: take this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning now therefore; be awakened to repentance.</p>
                  <p>This is that the Scripture calleth upon so much, <hi>Eccles. 11. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 11. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>O young man, in the dayes of thy youth, and let thy heart cheare thee in thy youth, and walke in the wayes of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all this, thou shalt come to Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> As if he should say: You that are in the middest of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, that solace your selves in the middest of the abundance of the earth, which you enjoy, that sport your selves in the pleasures of this world, know that there will come a Judgement day, see therefore now what will best answer God then. <hi>Since the end of all things is at hand</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>let us bee sober, and watch.</hi> Wee know not how neere the end of the world is, wee know in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it shall not bee yet, because Antichrist must bee destroyed, and the Jewes called before that day come: but neverthelesse, certainly thy end is neere, thy day, thy particular death (and that is the time of thy particular judgement) may be sudden: <hi>It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for all men once to die, and after that commeth the judgement;</hi> That is the particular Judgement that commeth upon Death: so I say, this may be the night of thy death, and the morning, may be the day of thy particular doome. <hi>Iudge your selves now, that you may not bee judged of the Lord:</hi> It was the use that the Apostle made even to good men: <hi>For this cause</hi> (saith he) <hi>many are sicke, and weake, and many sleepe;</hi> that is, they are dead: what then? <hi>If wee would judge our selves, wee should not bee judged of the Lord.</hi> So say I to you, judge your selves: now bring your selves as prisoners before the Barre: arraigne your selves as malefactours before the Judge: bring out the particular bills of inditement against your selves, whereby you have provoked God: yet there is mercie, the day of grace, and opportunity of repentance, and turning unto God, yet lasteth; therefore doe it now. I might adde many other helpes to this purpose, but these shall suffice at this present.</p>

Wee have an example before our eyes, enough to warne us of this. Here is an example of Death, which should teach us now to awaken our selves, and not to liue securely, as men that dreame of a long life, for many yeares.</p>
                  <p>Here is a young man dead: tooke away in the prime of his time, in the beginning of his dayes: his sicknesse though it held him not long, yet it was somewhat violent. How know you what a short time you have, though you are now young: or if you live longer, what sicknesse you may have: it may be you may be deprived of your reason and senses: therefore now, while health, and reason, and sense, while these <hi>Warning Sermons</hi> are afforded, take time, and make use of time, lest your secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie make good this Text upon you. <hi>When they shall say Peace, Peace, then sudden destruction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth upon them, as travaile upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape.</hi>

                        <item>common</item>
                        <item>continuall</item>
                     </list> enemies.</p>
                  <p>Common enemies I call them, because they are every mans enemies. Others though they bee enemies to some, they are friends to others, these to all.</p>
                  <p>Continuall, because their warre is never at an end. Other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies we may have truce with now and then, pauses, and breathing times, leasure given us, when we have done one skirmish to make ready for another: from these there is no intermission nor rest, not for a moment: wheresoever, or whatsoever we are about, it may be said to us, as <hi>Dalilah</hi> said to <hi>Sampson, Up Sampson, thy enemies are upon thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The three principall of these (yeeknow) are commonly rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned up to be. The <hi>Divell,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Flesh.</hi> But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle telleth us of a fourth, which hee calleth our <hi>Last enemie,</hi> the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:14764:141"/>
enemie which shall last of all assault us, the other will leave as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulting us, when we are in this world; this, when we are leaving the world, mustereth up his forces against us: sometimes holding us long play, as the house of <hi>David</hi> did the house of <hi>Saul,</hi> till our strength be wasted and spent, sometimes dispatching us with a sudden stroke, as <hi>Absolom</hi> did <hi>Amnon,</hi> when <hi>our hearts are merry</hi> within us. This enemie, Death, the very sound of his name, is like the name of <hi>Honiades</hi> to the <hi>Turkes,</hi> dreadfull to some: the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dreame of it dreadfull, as <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> dreame was to him, it troubled him, and <hi>the image of it, made him tremble and quake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though the hearing of an <hi>enemie</hi> may cause disturbance; yet withall to heare that this <hi>enemie</hi> is overcome and <hi>destroyed,</hi> the newes of that may cheare us. Behold, this is the newes that the Text bringeth. It telleth us of an <hi>enemie</hi> indeed, but it telleth us withall of the destruction of this <hi>enemie. Death</hi> is the common enemie of man-kind; It is our <hi>last enemie,</hi> we may thinke it none of the least, because it is <hi>the last:</hi> yet here is the destruction of it, <hi>Oh thou enemie, thy destruction shall come to a perpetuall end.</hi> It is already <note place="margin">Psal. 9. 6.</note> destroying, and as it is <hi>the last,</hi> so at the last it shall be destroyed.</p>
                  <p>Those are the two points that I am to treat of; of an <hi>Enemie,</hi> and of the destruction of this <hi>Enemie.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The parts of the Text.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Enemie</hi> is <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>the Last Enemie</hi> (as the Text calleth it) <hi>the last</hi> that shall assault us. In that yee may note two things; Its Qualitie, and Its Ranke.</p>
                  <p>First its nature and qualitie, An <hi>Enemie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, its order and ranke, in what ranke it is Fyled, not in the Fore-front of the battell, but it commeth behind in the Reare, it commeth in the end of the Armie (when all other enemies have given over) and setteth upon us at the last.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here is the destruction of the enemie, that is the Milke and honey of the Text. <hi>Death</hi> though it bee an <hi>Enemie,</hi> though it be a killing <hi>enemie,</hi> it shall not bee a conquering <hi>enemie.</hi> Hee that subdueth all our Enemies for us, will in time subdue them to us. And who he is, the Apostle telleth you in the verse before the Text, <hi>Christ our Lord, Hee shall reigne till hee hath put downe all his enemies under his feet:</hi> And as all His, so all ours too; both those that are Enemies to him, and to his death. Among the rest, he will destroy that also; As it is <hi>the last,</hi> with which we shall be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted, so it is the <hi>last that shall be destroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are three points of observation wee have here lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
                  <p>First, that <hi>Death is an Enemie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:14764:141"/>
Secondly, that <hi>Death is our last Enemie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that as <hi>Death</hi> assaulteth us <hi>last,</hi> so at <hi>last it shall bee destroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I begin with the first of these, <hi>That Death is an Enemie.</hi> And <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obser.</hi> 1. Death is an enemie.</note> an <hi>Enemie</hi> indeed it is; one of the Divels regiment. The Divell he is the Generall of the Armie: when hee brought sinne into the world, he brought <hi>Death</hi> into the world. Sinne drawes <hi>Death</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, as the Needle drawes the thread.</p>
                  <p>First I will shew yee what kind of Enemie it is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wherein it appeareth to be an Enemie.</p>
                  <p>First, what kind of Enemie Death is; <note place="margin">What kind of enemie.</note> A <list>
                        <item>common</item>
                        <item>secret</item>
                        <item>spirituall</item>
                        <item>continuall</item>
                     </list> Enemie.</p>
                  <p>First a <hi>Common Enemie;</hi> Common to all mankind. The charge <note place="margin">1. A common enemie. 1 King. 22. 31</note> it hath, is not like that upon the Aramites, fight neither with small nor great, save onely with the King of Israel. Great and small, King and Keisar, all are markes that this aimeth at: one killing weapon or other it hath for them all; like <hi>Ishmael, The hand of him is against</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 16. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>every man.</hi> The young and the old, the strong, and rich, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and wise, and holy, none can scape, none can keepe out of <hi>Deaths</hi> reach. <hi>What man is hee that liveth, and shall not see death?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 89. 48. <hi>Obiect.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yee will object to me peradventure. Those that shall live at the comming of our Lord, at the end of the world, <hi>shall not see Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I had thought (I confesse) to have stood a little upon this points discussion, but I must not. I have many things to say. In <note place="margin">Answ.</note> a word therefore; First, these are but a few, and a few make not a generall.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, though these die not the ordinary naturall death, but as <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Enoch, shall bee translated</hi> up to heaven; yet in their translation and assumption, they shall suffer a mutation and change which shall be in stead of <hi>Death.</hi> Their change is a kind of <hi>Death</hi> to them, as our death is a kind of change to us.</p>
                  <p>Therefore wee may account it a common Enemie to man-kind, <note place="margin">Josh. 23. 14.</note> for as the Scripture saith, <hi>It is the way of all the earth.</hi> And the Grave it is <hi>the house appointed for all living.</hi> It is a common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, <note place="margin">Job 30. 23.</note> and it is the more dangerous for that.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is <hi>A secret Enemie;</hi> And it is the more dangerous <note place="margin">2. A secret enemie.</note> for that. Secret Traytours are worse then open enemies: these may be prepared against, because we know them: those may sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize us unawares, because wee see them not, nor suspect them.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:14764:142"/>
Poore <hi>Uriah</hi> carrieth <hi>Death</hi> in his bosome: so wee carry <hi>death</hi> about us, though like a Moth it lie and fret in the garment, and we see not when it eateth, nor can certainly determine the time when it will grate asunder the thread of our life. What man living can divine when, and how, and where <hi>Death</hi> will seize upon him? it is not for any to determine such a thing, it lieth so secret, hee cannot find it out.</p>
                  <p>What a sort of diseases wee are subject to, you may imagine how many. Nay, yee cannot imagine how many, when the very eye (as some Occolists observe) hath above sixtie diseases. What a many casualties there are every moment, when as oft as wee step over the threshold, wee cannot tell whether ever wee shall come home againe. <hi>The fire saith, Death is in me; and the Water saith, Death is in mee;</hi> the earth we tread on hath <hi>Death</hi> in it; the Ayre we breath in, that which wee continually take in, and put out at our nosethrils hath <hi>death</hi> in it: <hi>Death</hi> dwelleth with us in our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; it walketh with us in the streets; It lieth downe with us in our beds; It is wrapped about us in our clothes that sticke to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Benhadad</hi> is slaine in his Bed. <hi>Amnon</hi> at his Table. <hi>Zachariah</hi> in the Temple. <hi>Ioab</hi> at the Altar. The disobedient <hi>Prophet</hi> is torne with a Lyon. The unbeleeving <hi>Prince</hi> is trod to <hi>Death</hi> in the croude. <hi>Abimelech</hi> slaine with a Mill-stone; and <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> with the fall of a Tyle. <hi>Adrian</hi> is choaked with a flie. <hi>Victor</hi> is poisoned with Wine. And one of the <hi>Emperours</hi> with the bread he recived in the Sacrament. Thus <hi>Death</hi> waiteth every where, and yet wee spie it not. It is a secret Enemie, and therefore the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is a <hi>spirituall Enemie.</hi> And it is the more dangerous <note place="margin">3. A spirituall Enemie.</note> for that. Spirituall I call it; First, because it is invisible, for the spirits are invisible, they cannot be seene; Such an <hi>enemie</hi> is <hi>Death,</hi> though we must all feele it, yet wee cannot see it: were it any way discernable, we might thinke of some way how wee might shift and shun it: but it is beyond the kenne of our eyes: we are no more able to see that then the Ayre: being therefore out of sight, it is out of our reach, we know not how to grapple with it; we know not with what weapons to encounter it.</p>
                  <p>And a <hi>Spirituall Enemie</hi> I call it, because though it seize on the body, it strikes at the soule: By Gods decree the <hi>death</hi> of the soule is a concommitant of the <hi>death</hi> of the Body, and were it not by Gods mercy reverst, they would still come like lightning and thunder, and strike both together.</p>
                  <p>Againe, it is a <hi>spirituall enemie,</hi> because it fighteth against us in the strength of sinne. It commeth armed with a <hi>Sting, the sting of death is sinne.</hi> Some make question whether if <hi>Adam</hi> had never sinned, he should ever have died. But me-thinkes the Apostle
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:14764:142"/>
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> putteth it out of qustion; <hi>By one mans disobedience sinne</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>came into the world, and by sinne death.</hi> All those <hi>Deaths</hi> that S. <hi>Austin</hi> reckoneth up: First when the soule is deprived of God, separated from him. Secondly, when the body is separated from the soule. Thirdly, when the Soule is separated from the body, and from God, and suffereth torments for a time. Lastly, when the soule is separated from God, and rejoyned to the body, to suffer torments eternally. All these are the recompence, and reward of sinne. Therefore <hi>Death</hi> comming, and being an Enemie thus armed, (whatsoever kind of <hi>death</hi> it be) we may well say it is a <hi>spirituall enemie,</hi> and the more spirituall, the more dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and lastly, it is <hi>a continuall Enemie.</hi> And it is the more <note place="margin">4. A continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Enemie.</note> dangerous for that. It laies hold of us in the wombe, and never leaves us, till it hath brought us to the Grave. Beloved, wee doe not only die when we die, but all the time we live, assoone as wee begin to live, we begin to die. As <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, <hi>Every day wee die, because every day some part of our life is gone.</hi> As a Candle, it is no sooner lighted, but presently it begins to waste: as an houre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasse, it is no sooner turned, but presently the sand begins to runne out. So our life, it is no sooner breathed, but presently it begins to vapour out. As the Sea, what it gaineth in one place, it loseth in another; so our life, what we gaine one way, wee lose it in another: looke what is added to it, so much is tooke from it; the longer a man liveth, the lesse he hath to live. <hi>Death</hi> doth by us, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did by <hi>Esau,</hi> catcheth us in the wombe, and never lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us.</p>
                  <p>So wee see it is a Common, a Secret, a Spirituall, a Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Enemie.</p>
                  <p>Next we are to consider; How, and wherein <hi>Death</hi> sheweth it <note place="margin">Wherein Death is an Enemie.</note> selfe an <hi>Enemie.</hi> What Death deserveth at our hands, to bee thus accounted and feared. Fearfull and terrible it is, that is certaine; So <hi>Aristotle, It is the most terrible of all terribles. Bildad</hi> in <hi>Iob,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <note place="margin">Job 18. 18. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> it the <hi>King of terrours.</hi> What doth <hi>Death</hi> bring with it to make it fearfull?</p>
                  <p>I answer, <hi>Death</hi> hath sundrie concomitants, and companions <note place="margin">In respect of its atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. 1. Sicknesse, &amp;c. Heb. 2. 15.</note> that attend it, that make it a formidable Enemie.</p>
                  <p>First, the Harbingers that come along with it; Sicknesses, and diseases, infirmities, old age, and difficulties. These are all fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to nature, and through feare of these, <hi>Death keepeth men all their life in bondage.</hi> They make our lives, <hi>as it were</hi> a life, rather like a life, then a life indeed. So that howsoever the Apostle said in another place, <hi>as it were dying, and Behold wee live.</hi> There <hi>Death</hi>

living, and behold wee die:</hi> here <hi>life</hi> hath the <hi>tanquam,</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> the <hi>Ecce.</hi> Life is but <hi>as it were</hi> a life, it is but the shadow of a life that man walketh in: <hi>Man walketh in a vaine shadow, and disquieteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 39. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>in vaine.</hi> It is true, it lighteth not on all alike, some it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth on as a Lyon, and breaking <hi>their bones from morning to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> it makes an end of them: to others it is as a Moth in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, secretly in their lives, by degrees, insensibly, pining and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming them. Howsoever, what Harbinger soever it bringeth, it visiteth us with many touches, and twitches, before it come: falling pell-mell, thicke and three-fold on us, when they come. In respect of these, it may be said to be an Enemie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the dissolution that <hi>Death</hi> bringeth. For it <hi>dissolveth the frame of nature;</hi> It divorceth, and separateth the soule from the <note place="margin">2. Dissolution of the frame of nature.</note> Bodie, those two companions, that have lived so lovingly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and perhaps have lived a long time together. This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing that makes <hi>Death</hi> looke like an <hi>Enemie.</hi> Friends and companions that have lived long together are loth to part: wee see in experience, old folke commonly are more loth to part, when they are old, then when they are young. Now there is none neerer then the soule and bodie: there is none have lived so long, or so loving: it must needs be tedious for these to part, and be an affliction and vexation, when neither the body can longer retaine the fleeting soule, or the soule longer sustaine the drouping body. Therefore in respect of this also, <hi>Death</hi> being the cause of this, no marvell though nature reluctate, and we looke upon it, as on the face of an <hi>Enemie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the horrour of the Grave: <hi>The men of Darknesse,</hi> as <note place="margin">3. The grave.</note> 
                     <hi>Iob</hi> calleth it: the place of oblivion; the pit of stinch and rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; this is another thing that nature shrinketh and relucts at. For there we must burie out of our sight, that that once was <hi>the delight of our eyes,</hi> as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> said by his wife. And though it were <note place="margin">Ezek. 24. 16.</note> never so lovely before, yet it quickly becommeth loathsome. Our Beds must be made in darknesse, where <hi>corruption and wormes,</hi> must be the Mattresse and Coverled, to lie under us, and spread over us; <hi>Thou shalt say to Corruption, thou art my father, and to the worme, thou art my mother, and my sister.</hi> That bodie of thine, that <note place="margin">Isa. 14. 11.</note> God in the wombe so <hi>wonderfully made,</hi> that thou all thy life-time (peradventure) hast delicately cherished, lapped in Silke, in Furre, pampered with sweet wines, <hi>Death</hi> as a proud Tyrant will set his foot upon it, and throw thee downe to the horrid dungeon, where thy flesh shall putrifie, and thy bones rot, and the beauty of it (though sometime it were as the Rose and the Lilly of the field) shall soone become as loathsome as the dung in the streets. This is another thing that makes the face of <hi>Death</hi> dreadful and terrible, when we thinke of such privations, and annihilations as these, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:14764:143"/>
wee shall come from a beeing to no beeing. These cannot but make <hi>Death</hi> looke with the face of an <hi>Enemie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The losse and deprivation of all worldly contentments,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. Losse of worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, and actions.</note> and worldly imployments: that is another thing that makes <hi>Death</hi> terrible and fearfull to us. Looke whatsoever contentment wee tooke in any thing here, we must bid it farewell then. Farewell to all, to profits and pleasures, and honours, we shall carrie none of them away with us; <hi>None of our pompe and glory shall descend</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 49. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>after us,</hi> as the Psalmist saith. Farewell to all the gold and silver we have gathered together, to all the goodly lands wee have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased, to all the stately houses we have built, to all the pleasant gardens, and orchards wee have planted, to all the sports and pastimes we have had, to all our merry consorts wee have kept company with, to all our Jewels and wardrope, to our dauncing, and feasting, and musicke: <hi>Death</hi> pulleth us from all these, and layeth us levell with the Dust; It mingleth shovels and Scepters together; It makes rich and poore, the Prince and the Peasant alike; <hi>I shall see man no more.</hi> All relations we have now, shall be broken off then, betweene Husband and Wife, Parents and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <note place="margin">Isa. 38. 11.</note> Master and servants, neighbour and neighbour, friend and friend: wee shall dwell apart with our selves, and not so much as shake hands one with another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All the services and imployments</hi> wee are tooke up with here, shall cease then: there shall be no frequenting of the Exchange, no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising of Trade, no bearing of Office, no working in our Calling. <hi>Death is the night that no man can worke in:</hi> and <hi>Death is the place of silence,</hi> where all affaires are cut off: Where there is <hi>no worke nor invention, nor wisedome, nor counsell,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith in the booke of the <hi>Preacher.</hi> Oh saith good <hi>Hezekiah; I shall see the Lord no more in the land of the living.</hi> There is no more service to be done to the Lord, nor no more in the Church, in that manner as it is now: there is no exercise of Religion, no Word, no Sacraments, no Fasting, no Almes, no Preaching, no Prayer, no Confession and thankes-giving. <hi>The Corse cannot praise thee, the Grave cannot give thankes, they that goe downe into the pit cannot honour thee.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 6.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh (Beloved) how carefull and active, and vigilant, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent should this make us to be (when wee consider it) for the well improving of that time that wee have lent unto us, and for the well-discharging of those places, and offices, and duties that are now laid upon us; Considering that <hi>Death is an enemie</hi> that will cut us off from all affaires, and bereave us of all opportunities of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving or doing, or performing any service to God at all, either <note place="margin">5. Conscience of sinne, and certainty of Judgement, and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> in Church or Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly and lastly, <hi>Conscience of sinne, and certaintie of iudgement,</hi> and uncertainty of salvation (for brevities sake I put them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:14764:144"/>
these things come along with <hi>Death,</hi> and make the face of <hi>Death</hi> terrible and fearfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conscience of sinne</hi> first of all. For <hi>Sinne it is the sting of Death.</hi> And which of us is there that doth not arme <hi>Death</hi> with that sting? Who can reflect on the passages of his life, but he shall find it as full of sinne, as the <hi>Leopard of spots.</hi> Wee find nothing in sinne now, but oblectation and delight, and therefore wee <hi>hide it under our tongue,</hi> and hugge it in our bosomes. Oh but when <hi>Death</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth once, it thrusteth these things out, and oh the horrour and anguish that the poore conscience is tormented, and made to smart with.</p>
                  <p>Againe, with conscience of sinne, <hi>certainty of judgement;</hi> that is another dreadfull Arrow in Deaths quiver, <hi>After Death commeth judgement. And wee must all appeare before the judgement seat of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 27. 2 Cor. 5. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ, to receive according to what wee have done in our bodies.</hi> First, the particular judgement that passeth upon the soule, it shall never be reverst, for as the <hi>Tree falleth, so it lieth.</hi> And then the Generall judgement, when the Body and Soule shall both bee wrapped up in the same condemnation. Oh who <hi>can dwell with devouring fire? with those everlasting burnings?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 33. 14.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then lastly; The <hi>uncertaintie of our future estate.</hi> For how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands bee there that die, that cannot tell what becommeth of them when they die, but they must sing that Farewell to their soules as <hi>Adrian</hi> to his, <hi>My poore wandring soule, whether art thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? What will become of thee? Death</hi> then being accompanied with such an Armie of Terrours as these, the Apostle might well call it, as it is in the Text; <hi>An Enemie.</hi> That is the first thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we are to consider how it is called the last Enemie.</p>
                  <p>For two reasons; First, because it is the <hi>last</hi> that shall assault us. So <hi>Caietan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, because it is the <hi>Last that shall bee destroyed.</hi> So the <note place="margin">Why Death called the last enemie. 1. Because it is the last that shall assault us. Therfore we have more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies than Death.</note> common streame of interpreters.</p>
                  <p>It is the <hi>Last Enemie</hi> that shall assault us. And here I have to note two things;</p>
                  <p>First, that while wee live in the world, we have more Enemies in the world. For when there are some last, there must bee others going before. If <hi>Death bee the last Enemie,</hi> there are some others beside. I, we have so (God knoweth) Enemies on every side. Without us, within us.</p>
                  <p>The Divell he is an <hi>Enemie</hi> to us, and vollies of tentation hee <note place="margin">The Divell.</note> hath to discharge against us. So many tentations, so many <hi>Enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>World</hi> is an <hi>enemie</hi> to us: An <hi>enemie</hi> when it seemeth a friend; <note place="margin">The world.</note> When it smileth it betrayeth: it kisseth and killeth. On the right hand it hath prosperitie to allure, on the left hand adversitie to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:14764:144"/>
affright; in every corner, wicked counsell, and company, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to seduce and insnare us.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, our owne <hi>flesh</hi> is an <hi>enemie.</hi> It is a Serpent wee carry in <note place="margin">The flesh.</note> our bosomes. The <hi>Divell</hi> is a serpent in Hell: the <hi>world</hi> is a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in our hand: the <hi>flesh</hi> is a Serpent in our bosome. Wee carry it with us where ever wee goe: It is a con-naturall, concorporate <hi>Enemie.</hi> All our other <hi>enemies</hi> could doe us no hurt, if it were not for that, if this <hi>enemie</hi> that cohabiteth with us, did not combine against us. Know (who everthou art) there is no <hi>Enemie</hi> like thy selfe: thy selfe is the worst enemie of all. All the sparkes that flie out of Sathans engines, could never <hi>sindge a haire of our heads,</hi> if our <hi>flesh</hi> were not as tinder. All the windes that blow in the foure corners of the world, could not <hi>make shipwracke</hi> of us, if our <hi>flesh</hi> were not a treacherous Pilot. <hi>Death</hi> (that gnaweth the thread of our soule and body asunder) could not separate them, or them from God, if the <hi>flesh</hi> did not whet the teeth of it, and sharpen it with a sting.</p>
                  <p>So then we see, we have a great many <hi>Enemies</hi> more to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us besides Death, some without, some within. Therefore how should this teach us circumspect walking? to <hi>behave our selves wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in every thing,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> when he knew <hi>Saul</hi> was his <hi>Enemie,</hi> and had an eye upon him to doe him mischiefe. How should it teach us to pray with <hi>David; Lord teach mee thy way, and lead me in the right</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 27. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>path, because of mine enemie?</hi> That is one thing I have to note.</p>
                  <p>Againe, another thing I have to note; If <hi>Death</hi> be the <hi>last ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Therefore likely to be the worst enemie.</note> then in all probabilitie it is like to be the worst. Of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels regiment it is (I told yee before) Hee is the Generall of the Armie. And (beloved) beleeve it, the Divell is very politique and subtile, in marshalling his forces, hee will not place his best Souldiers in the forefront of the battell, but keepes them in the Reare, he puts them behind, that when all the rest have wearied and tired us, they should set on us afresh. He is so cunning a dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, that he reserveth the best arguments for the last. A cunning Gamester, that plaies his best play at the last; A cunning Archer, that shootes his best shaft at the last. So since <hi>Death is the last Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> it is like to be the sorest.</p>
                  <p>Now the sorer we are like to find him, the carefuller we should be to arme against him: alwayes to put our selves in a readinesse, that whensoever he commeth, hee may find us weaponed: that if it were possible, we might be alwayes doing, as if wee were dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it being the height of the perfection, that any soule can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to (as the heathens themselves well observed) <hi>for a man to spend every day, as if it were his last day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is one reason why the Apostle here calleth <hi>Death the last enemie,</hi> because the <hi>last is like to be the worst.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="272" facs="tcp:14764:145"/>
Againe, another reason. As it is the last by which wee are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted, <note place="margin">2. Because it is the last that shall be destroyed.</note> so it is the <hi>last that shall bee destroyed.</hi> That the Apostle principally meant here (as Interpreters commonly understand it) When he saith the <hi>last enemie that shall be destroyed is Death,</hi> hee meant that <hi>Death is the Enemie that shall be destroied last.</hi> And this leadeth me to the last point I propounded to speake of, <hi>That Death is an enemie, and the last enemie, and at last shall be destroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It shall be destroyed, that is one thing.</p>
                  <p>Who undertakes the doing of it? Our selves? In likelihood <note place="margin">Who it is that destroyeth Death. Rev. 5. 3. 5.</note> Death is more likely to destroy us, then we it. But as it is said of the <hi>seven-sealed booke</hi> in the Revelation, <hi>when there was none in heaven, or in earth, or under the earth, that was able to open it, the Lion of the tribe of Iudah, prevailed to open the booke.</hi> So the <hi>Lion of the tribe of Iudah</hi> prevaileth to <hi>destroy</hi> this <hi>enemie,</hi> that <hi>none in heaven, or in earth, or under the earth, but only he, is able to destroy.</hi> Hee saith of him, as <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Goliah,</hi> when hee defied the host of Israel, and all men ranne away, <hi>Let no mans heart faile him.</hi> So saith the <note place="margin">1 Sam. 17, 32. Hos. 13. 14.</note> sonne of <hi>David, The Lord of David, let no mans heart faile him, I will goe to fight with yonder Philistim. Oh Death I will be thy death, It is spoken in the person of Christ,</hi> whom Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calleth <hi>the Lord of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 3. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>life.</hi> Hee subdueth all Enemies, and it is he that will <hi>destroy Death,</hi> hee will not leave him, till he have <hi>trod him under foot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when will Christ doe this? Wee see <hi>Death</hi> playes the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <note place="margin">When Deach shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</note> still, it killeth and spoyleth, as fast as it did; his sickle is in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones harvest; as fast as the corne growes up, hee cuts it downe, he leaveth not an eare standing. How long Lord, how long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this (that the Apostle tells us of) will be?</p>
                  <p>At <hi>last.</hi> His meaning is, at the generall day of the Resurrection: <note place="margin">At the day of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> when the end of the world shall come, then Christ shall <hi>destroy</hi> him. And he bringeth it in the rather, to assure the Corinths of that, that some of them doubted of; namely, that there should be a Resurrection. For unlesse the <hi>dead should arise,</hi> how can <hi>Death</hi> be <hi>destroyed?</hi> But <hi>Death</hi> shall be <hi>destroyed,</hi> therefore it is out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion that the <hi>dead shall rise againe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what comfort have we in the meane time, if <hi>Death</hi> be not <hi>destroyed</hi> till then? if till then it play the domineering <hi>Enemie?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No, not so neither. Wee have comfort enough in that, that <note place="margin">Comfort in the meane time.</note> Christ hath already done. Though it bee not already <hi>destroyed,</hi> yet it is already <hi>subdued.</hi> It is not only subdued, but disarmed, and not only so, but captivated, and triumphed over. Hee subdued it when he died; in suffering <hi>death</hi> he overcame <hi>Death;</hi> hee beat him in his owne ground, at his owne weapons: in his owne hold hee disarmed him. When he rose againe, then he spoyled him of his power, and tooke his weapons away, and triumphed over him in the open field. When he ascended into heaven, then hee carried
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:14764:145"/>
those spoiles with him in token of conquest, as <hi>Sampson</hi> tooke the <hi>Gates of Gaza on his shoulders, and carried them to the top of the hill.</hi> Christ by Death tooke the <hi>sting of Death</hi> away; by his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hee tooke the <hi>strength of Death</hi> away; by his Ascension hee tooke away the <hi>hope of Death,</hi> for ever conquering or prevailing more; finally, at the last Judgement hee will take away the name and beeing of <hi>Death,</hi> so that it shall never bee more remembred, but <hi>mortality shall be swallowed up of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I, Christ hath done this for himselfe (perhaps) but what is this to us?</p>
                  <p>Nay, Christ hath done it, not only for his owne victorie, but he hath <hi>given us victorie:</hi> hee is not only a conquerour, but hee hath made us conquerours: <hi>thankes be unto God, that hath given us</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 15. 57</note> 
                     <hi>victorie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a word, Christ hath, and will doe by <hi>Death,</hi> as hee doth by our sinnes: he hath subdued them already: at the last hee will ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly destroy them: sinne and <hi>Death</hi> both of them are already subdued, at last they shall be abolished and destroyed, that they shall be no more. As there shall bee <hi>no more sorrow and paine,</hi> so there shall be no more <hi>death</hi> and sinne: <hi>All teares shall be wiped from</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 7. 17. Hos. 13. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>our eyes: I will ransomethem from the power of the grave, and redeeme them from death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>More then this; This yet addeth to our comfort, Christ will so <hi>destroy Death,</hi> as hee will not only subdue him for us, but also reconcile him to us: not only foile him as an <hi>Enemie,</hi> but propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and make him our friend. Wee have all our <hi>enemies</hi> subdued to us, but some are so subdued, that they are reconciled: <hi>Death</hi> is one of them, it is a reconciled, as well as a subdued <hi>enemie.</hi> In stead of bringing forth <hi>children for bondage,</hi> it becommeth a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser of our freedome: it is so farre from plucking us from Christ, as rather it letteth us into Christ: so farre from being a losse, as it bringeth gaine: so farre from being a dammage, that it is part of our Dowrie: therefore the Apostle reckoneth it as a prerogative, as hee saith, that <hi>the world, and life, and Christ is ours, so Death is ours.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 22.</note> Indeed if <hi>Death</hi> were not ours, life were not ours; for our only way to life now is by <hi>Death.</hi> Such a friend is this <hi>Enemie</hi> become, that it is a Bridge to passe to heaven: the <hi>Chariot</hi> that wee are tooke up to heaven in. What we get of life toward life, we lose in <hi>death,</hi> but what we get in <hi>death</hi> toward life, we never lose.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Application, and conclusion of all. Something I have to say by way of comfort, and something by way of counsell.</p>
                  <p>First, by way of comfort; Against the feare of <hi>Death,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> over-much sorrow for those that <hi>Death</hi> takesaway.</p>
                  <p>It is true, <hi>Death is an Enemie.</hi> But to whom? only to the wicked <note place="margin">Death an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy only to the wicked.</note>

that are out of Christ, to those that have no benefit at all by his Death and Resurrection, and ascension. When <hi>Death</hi> commeth and findeth out these, they may say as <hi>Ahab</hi> did to <hi>Eliah,</hi> and more truly a great deale, <hi>hast thou found me, oh mine Enemie?</hi> It is the worst <hi>Enemie</hi> they have in the world. It is a cruell Sergeant, that <note place="margin">1 King. 21. 20</note> catcheth them by the throat, and arresteth them for a debt that they are never able to pay: It dragges them to the Jayle, casteth them into the Dungeon, to the chaines of Darknesse. I have not a word of comfort to say to them. They have no more comfort in <hi>Death,</hi> then they have in Hell, where though they shall lie in torments and paine, they shall not have a <hi>drop of water to coole their tongue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to the faithfull in Christ, there is comfort upon comfort. <note place="margin">Death to the beleever is</note> For though Death be an Enemie, yet remember, first it is a subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Enemie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a reconciled Enemie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and lastly, an Enemie that one day shall not be at all.</p>
                  <p>It is a subdued Enemie, that is one comfort. The strength and <note place="margin">1. A subdued Enemie.</note> sting of it is gone. When a Bee hath lost his sting, and is a Droane, it can hurt no more. So Death is a Droane to a Christian, it hums and buzzeth, it doth no hurt, it cannot sting, the sting is gone.</p>
                  <p>Against all those Enemies that I formerly told yee of, that are attendants on Death, here is comfort.</p>
                  <p>First it is true: <hi>Death</hi> commeth with ill Harbingers, it bringeth sicknesses, and aches, and paine, but there is comfort against this. For when God sendeth paine, remember hee promiseth to send patience too: that he will put his hand under to helpe, <hi>His left hand shall bee under us, and his right hand over us,</hi> to catch us: hee hath <note place="margin">Cant. 8. 3.</note> promised comfort upon our sicke beds, <hi>to make our bed in our sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 41. 3.</note> Wee need not make such an Allegorie as <hi>Ambrose</hi> doth: this sweet flesh of ours, the Bed of our soule, it is under infirmities and weaknesses: God helpeth us, he makes our bed: <hi>hee saith to the sicke of the Palsey, Take up thy bed: hee turneth our bed in our sicknesse,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he sends us health, (so some expounds it) hee turnes the bed of sicknesse, into a bed of health: or God turneth our bed for us in our sicknesse; that is, he refresheth us, giveth us ease, when we lie upon our sicke beds. It is a Metaphor borrowed from those that attend sicke persons, that helpe to make their Beds easie and soft, and turne them, that they may lie at ease: So God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised his children in the painfull time of sicknesse, to make their Beds easie and soft, to cause them to lie at ease by the Patience that he will give them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is true, <hi>Death</hi> bringeth dissolution, and dissolveth the frame of nature, it separateth and divorceth those two loving companions, the Soule and the Body. But there is comfort in this. For though it divorce the Soule and the Body, yet it cannot
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:14764:146"/>
destroy the soule and the body: even the body is in the hand of God, when it is rotting in the earth, as the Soule is translated to heaven. Againe, though they be separated, yet it is but for a time, one day they shall meet more joyfull, and glorious then ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and after that they shall never be separated againe. Lastly, though he separate the soule from the body, and the body from the soule, yet neither from Christ, nor Christ from them. Nay, it is so farre from separating, that it helpeth to unite us to Christ, (as I said before) the dissolution of those shall bee the conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him; <hi>I desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is true, the horrour of the Grave attendeth <hi>Death,</hi> and the putrifaction of this flesh of ours, that must turne to corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, it makes it terrible and fearfull. But there is comfort against this. For after that time of putrifaction, there shall bee a time of restitution, and though the wormes devoure this flesh of ours, <hi>yet in that very flesh of ours, wee shall see God another day, These eyes shall</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job 19. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>see him.</hi> There is comfort in that, that when God shall come to restore us with himselfe, what the Grave hath clothed with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, he will cloath with glory; <hi>these vile bodies, hee will make</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>them like the glorious body of Christ,</hi> without all corruption.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is true, <hi>Death</hi> depriveth us of worldly friends, of worldly imployments, this makes it terrible; Yet there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort against this. Though we be deprived of worldly friends, it carries us to heaven, to better company, <hi>to Angels, to the spirits of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>just and perfect men, to God the Iudge of all, to Iesus the Mediatour of the New Testament.</hi> Nay besides, one day hee will restore againe those very friends, of which here we are deprived: though wee lose them for a time, in heaven wee shall meet againe, and there renew a perpetuall league of societie and love. So though it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of worldly benefits, it cannot of heaven, and those are better, they are not <hi>pleasures of sinne, that last for a season, but at the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>right hand of God, that endure for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So though it deprive us of worldly services, it carrieth us to heaven, to those that are better, that are high and proper to the Church triumphant, such as befit the Church, to <hi>sing Hallelujahs;</hi> and such as are profitable to the Church militant, by the memorie of good examples, and by the prayers they offer to God, not in particular, for they know no mans particular wants, yet for the generall and common good of all.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and lastly; It is true, the consideration of sinne, and of Judgement, and our uncertaine estate after <hi>death,</hi> makes it terrible like the face of an <hi>Enemie.</hi> Yet there is comfort against these.</p>
                  <p>For sinne. I told you that though there bee a <hi>sting</hi> in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, yet Christ hath drawne out that <hi>sting,</hi> so that being a Serpent without a <hi>sting,</hi> we may doe as <hi>Moses, take it in our hand,</hi> put it into
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:14764:147"/>
our bosome, and it will never doe us hurt, to them that die in the Lord: <hi>Death rather came</hi> by sinne, then for sinne; It is not betweene sinne and damnation, but betweene sinne and salvation.</p>
                  <p>For judgement; It is true, <hi>Death</hi> presenteth judgement, but it presenteth it with comfort, for the day of Judgement, is the day that the godly looke for, and long for, as the day of redemption, not of confusion; when they shall receive the sentence by which they shall bee absolved, and not condemned. For they know when God shall come to be their Judge, hee shall come to be their Saviour.</p>
                  <p>And so for the uncertaintie of our future estate after <hi>death.</hi> It is true, the state of the dead, in regard of naturall understanding, it may be a thing uncertaine and obscure, yet from the secre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>All these things are helpes to give us comfort against the feare of <hi>Death,</hi> and those <hi>Enemies</hi> that <hi>Death</hi> comes attended with: that though it be an Enemie, yet it is a subdued Enemie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it may comfort us, to consider that <hi>Death</hi> is not only <note place="margin">2. A recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled Enemie.</note> a subdued, but a reconciled <hi>Enemie;</hi> of an <hi>Enemie</hi> it is made to bee a friend: it is so to all the faithfull; such a friend, as they have not a better in the world. It is most certaine, the wicked have not a worse <hi>enemie</hi> in the world then <hi>Death,</hi> and the godly have not a better friend; so yee should see if I had leisure to shew you, on the one side from what labour and care, and miserie, it helpeth to free them; and on the other side, to what comfort, and rest, and peace, and joy, it helpeth to bring them.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, it may comfort us, to consider that as <hi>death</hi> is an <hi>enemie,</hi>

But the godly, and the faithfull <hi>shall have their part and portion given them in the resurrection to life,</hi> where they shall never <hi>

                        </gap>ast of death more.</hi> What the Apostle saith of Christ, is true of all those that are in Christ, <hi>when they are once dead, they shall die no more,</hi> Death <hi>hath no more dominion over them.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But I cannot inlarge these comforts; Yet (Beloved) I have a word or two of counsell, I pray hearken to it. Birefly thus.</p>
                  <p>Christ though he have overcome, and destroyed both <hi>death</hi> and <note place="margin">

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:14764:147"/>
also in subduing and overcomming them, Christ hath not so fought for us, but he will have us also fight for our selves: as hee hath <hi>overcome death,</hi> so must we for our parts, that wee may have the comfort of that that Christ hath done. <hi>Death</hi> being an <hi>enemie</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">How to be prepared for death.</note> to us, we must prepare and arme our selves against it, that it may not be an <hi>Enemie</hi> too strong.</p>
                  <p>And for your better direction take these few heads.</p>
                  <p>First, Remember that <hi>Death is the wages of sinne.</hi> It is sinne that <note place="margin">1. Die to sin.</note> lead <hi>Death</hi> into the world: it is in respect of that, that <hi>Death</hi> is an <hi>Enemie</hi> to us, and were it not for that, it would bee no <hi>Eenemie</hi> at all. Now then (beloved) if yee will not die in your sinnes, let your care be to <hi>die to sinne:</hi> labour to have sinne die in thee, and then thou shalt not die in that. When thou hast committed drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, or prophanenesse, &amp;c. thinke with thy selfe, this is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and sweet now; but how will this tast another day, when I shall come to lie upon my death-bed, and my soule shall set on my pale lips, ready to take her flight, and bee brought before the Judgement seat of Christ? <hi>What fruit will these things bring then?</hi> What comfort, and peace, and joy, will it procure to the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence then? Oh (saith <hi>Abner</hi> to <hi>Ioab) knowest thou not, that this will be bitternesse in the end?</hi> It will be as gall and wormwood, therefore if yee would not have <hi>Death</hi> be bitter then, let not sinne bee sweet now: part with sinne betime. That is the first.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, learne to <hi>walke humbly with God</hi> betime, and betime put your selves in a way of repentance, and new obedience: take <note place="margin">2. Live to God.</note> heed of dallying with God, and procrastinating, and putting off the time. What is the reason why a sort die (as <hi>Plinie</hi> saith some doe, that are stung with the Serpent <hi>Colemion)</hi> some laughing, some raging, some so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They have not beene carefull to walke with God while they lived; because they wanted care then, they want comfort now. <hi>They that remember not God in their life</hi> (saith S. <hi>Austin) it is just with God to forget them in death.</hi> The Apostle S. <hi>Peter</hi> would have us <hi>looke for new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</hi> But never looke thou to dwell in that heaven where righteousnesse dwelleth, except righteousnesse dwell in thee: And he exhorteth us, <hi>that wee be found of God in peace at that day:</hi> that is sweet and comfortable indeed; but remember, <hi>Peace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse goe together,</hi> if we would be <hi>found of God in peace,</hi> wee must be <hi>found of him in holinesse:</hi> Walke in holinesse and uprightnesse, and then <hi>peace shall kisse</hi> thee on thy death-bed: <hi>Marke the upright and just man, the end of that man is peare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the better to subdue <hi>Death,</hi> be willing to meditate and <note place="margin">3. Be of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:14764:148"/>
How shall we doe that?</p>
                  <p>I will shew you. Consider we have many little deaths to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe in the world, as we have many delights; Learne to inure and acquaint thy selfe before hand with the patient and quiet bearing and enduring of these many troubles and crosses that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall thee, As <hi>Agamemnon first overcame the Lacedemonians by wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and then by fighting, and</hi> Bilney <hi>first burnt his finger in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, that after he might the better endure the burning of his body at the stake.</hi> So thinke with your selves, If I cannot endure a little, how shall I endure more? If I cannot endure a light crosse, a small af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, doe I murmure at that? Am I impatient and repine at that? How shall I beare the pangs of <hi>Death,</hi> when they come? Therefore let us inure our selves to a meeke, and quiet bearing of lesser stripes, so wee may be better able to endure heavier stroakes. Many of us lay out a great deale of care how to live in the world, we had more need take care how to die, when wee shall leave the world. Studie the Art of dying; That is the third.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, that we may the better subdue <hi>Death,</hi> that it may not <note place="margin">4. Settle all things before hand, that</note> be an <hi>Enemie</hi> too strong; Learne before so to dispose of our selves, and order our affaires, that when <hi>Death</hi> commeth, wee may have nothing to doe but to die. Get all differences reconciled, all doubts settled, all reckonings ordered: sequester our selves from all other avocations, that nothing may interrupt us, when that worke is to goe in hand with. <hi>Put thy house in order</hi> (saith God to <hi>Hezekiah;)</hi> I say so to every one of you. First, your outward house, that which concerneth your worldly estate, <hi>put that house in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">concerne the outward man.</note> 
                     <hi>order.</hi> What? wouldest thou make thy Will and testament, and be troubled about that, when thou hadst more need to have that Will and testament confirmed, that Christ hath made?</p>
                  <p>And then set thy soule and conscience, thy inner house in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <note place="margin">The inward man.</note> let not conscience be to seeke then of any thing that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thee for thy peace toward God and man. Die thus, and die happily. Though <hi>Death be an enemie,</hi> yet thou shalt not be hurt of it, because it is subdued, and at last thou shalt get the victorie over it, when thou shalt see it utterly <hi>destroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now as I have exhorted you to doe this, by way of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, so yet a little further I crave patience, that I may encourage you to doe it by way of example: By the example of this blessed servant, and Saint of God, for whose occasion you have given this meeting, and I have preached this Sermon.</p>

                     <hi>all this.</hi> Shee had learned to live soberly. Shee was a patterne of sobrietie. Sober in her countenance, in her diet, in her apparell, in her speech, in all her behaviour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the grace of God taught her to live righteously,</hi> both in those things that concerne the workes of justice, and those things that concerne the workes of mercy: both are referred to righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>For her Justice, I am perswaded shee was exceeding carefull in all her wayes <hi>to keepe a good Conscience.</hi> I am sure she was a woman very diligent and painfull in her Calling, shee was truly one of those good house-wives that <hi>Solomon</hi> describeth in <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. and had studied that Chapter well, and attained the practise of it: she could never endure idlenesse in any: there was no plague (she said) to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and that diligence in our Callings sets open a dore to many blessings, and shuts up the dore to many tentations. I may call her a discreet woman, <hi>that was a crowne to her husband;</hi> so <hi>Solomon</hi> said a vertuous woman is. Hee had a rich portion, when God gave him her. <hi>Houses and lands come by inheritance, but a Prudent wife commeth of the Lord.</hi> Shee was an excellent guide to her family, to her ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: Children she had none. She had such children as S. <hi>Austin</hi> speakes of, and he saith, they are those children that <hi>women are saved by;</hi> What children, saith he? Good workes: and those children shee was full of. She did the part of a Mother in bringing up her servants that were with her: insomuch as she would say sometimes (though they were none of her owne children) <hi>Behold, here am I, and the children that God hath given me.</hi> And for workes of mercie aswell as justice, she was most open-hearted and handed, not only to doe according, but beyond her abilitie: alwayes ready upon every occasion <hi>to distribute, and administer to the necessities of the Saints,</hi> and provoked, and stirred others to the doing of the like. Among her neighbours she lived unblameably: A woman of a <hi>meeke and quiet spirit,</hi> and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>Such of God are much set</hi>

In publike, She was a religious frequenter of the ordinances on the Lords day, and on the weeke dayes, a diligent hearer and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender, an excellent rememberer: one of the best Remembrancers that I have heard of. And in private, she was excellent for duties

there, both for the discharge of her owne dutie, by giving ensam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to others, and many times by good and godly exhortations and instructions, and daily by private reading and prayer, shee set apart some time for her selfe, for private meditation.</p>
                  <p>In her sicknesse, she was a spectacle for thousands to looke on. It pleased God to lay a long and heavy affliction upon her. Shee had a Cancer in her breast, that had beene on her three yeares: in the two last yeares she suffered a great deale of extremity, as you may imagine by one thing that I shall say. Shee was faine to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a great deale of dressing with Corrasives and sharpe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; a great deale of cutting, and searing, and burning: shee was above fiftie times burnt with hot Irons: but (Lord) with what patience did she still endure it? Shee would say, <hi>It was no matter; sanctified afflictions were better then unsanctified prosperity. Apelles</hi> said, when the picture of a beautifull woman was to be compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawne, he must borrow one part from one, and another from another, and put altogether. She had learned this. Shee had loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on many good patternes in the Scripture, and had drawne to her selfe an imitation of them all, so that she was a perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Modell. Though I say much, yet I know, I say, nothing but the truth. I read of few excellent women in the Scripture, but she made them a patterne of one vertue or other. For obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, she was a <hi>Saraah:</hi> for wisedome a <hi>Rebecca:</hi> for meeknesse a <hi>Hannah:</hi> for a discreet temper, an <hi>Abigal:</hi> for good houswiverie a <hi>Martha:</hi> for pietie, a <hi>Mary,</hi> a <hi>Lydia.</hi> I know not any necessarie thing, that belonged to make up a good Christian, but in some measure it pleased God to bestow it on her. Thus she continued all her life in the time of her health: and in sicknesse with so much patience as (after a sort) she endured a martyrdome, and I see no reason but we may allow a Martyr of Gods making, aswell as of mans: I am sure, if God make Martyrs, I know not any fitter then she, so meeke, and patient, and constant. <hi>Many daughters</hi> (saith <note place="margin">Prov. 31. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Solomon) have done vertuously, but thou surmountest them all.</hi> I will not say so of her, because I decline flatterie. But this I will say, that I know not many excell her, scarse any that come neere her. She hath the reward of that shee hath done, given her of God, and <hi>her workes follow her.</hi> We leave her to God, and having committed her soule into his hands, we beseech his gracious favour upon our selves.</p>

Every day, upon the day of <hi>death,</hi> because there is no day wherein <hi>death</hi> may not befall us. And every day, upon the day of <hi>Iudgement,</hi> because as the day of <hi>Death</hi> leaveth us, so the day of <hi>Iudgement</hi> findeth us. We had an occasion like to this not long since. Then (you may remember) I discoursed of <hi>Death</hi> considered as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. I shewed you what kind of enemie it is: it is a common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: a secret enemie: a spirituall enemie. Now at this time (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the like occasion) I thought it not amisse for me to discourse of that that commeth immediatly after <hi>Death,</hi> that is <hi>Iudgement.</hi>

The Apostle saith, <hi>Heb. 9. 27. It is appointed to all men once to die, and after Death commeth Iudgement.</hi> And it is that that <hi>Solomon</hi> mindeth <note place="margin">Coherence.</note> us of here in the words of my Text: which he addeth as a reason to that grave advice he gave in the verse before going. Having discoursed at large in this booke concerning the <hi>vanity</hi> of all earthly things, and the <hi>vexation</hi> among those things that are under the Sunne: he telleth us where it is best for us to set up our rest: that is, in learning that one lesson, <hi>Feare God, and keepe his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, for this is the totall;</hi> all that God requireth. That we might the rather be stirred up to hearken to this counsell, hee telleth us, that whether we doe or no, the day will come that we shall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to an account, when <hi>God will bring every one</hi> of us <hi>to Iudgement,</hi> and take a tryall of <hi>every worke</hi> we have done, and <hi>of every secret thing, whether it be good or evill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In handling of these words we have two things in generall that <hi>Solomon</hi> speakes of. <note place="margin">Division.</note>

                  <p>Secondly, the things <hi>Iudged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Person <hi>Iudging,</hi> is God. And there I will speake,</p>
                  <p>First of the <hi>Iudge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then of the <hi>Iudgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>things</hi> that God <hi>bringeth to Iudgement</hi> and tryall, hee telleth us first, <hi>every worke,</hi> every thing, be it never so <hi>secret.</hi> And then a more particular resolution: those things that are <hi>good,</hi> and those things that are <hi>evill. God will bring every worke to Iudgement, and every secret thing, whether it bee good, or whether it be evill.</hi>
                  </p>

Of the Sonne, to be begotten of the Father. And it is the property of the Holy Ghost, incommunicably, to proceed from both. But those workes that they call <hi>Externall;</hi> that is, those workes by which the power and wisedome of the Godhead are externally made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to the creature, such as creation, preservation, redemption: those equally and indifferently proceed from all the Persons: not from one in parcular, but from all in generall: and this of <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is one. For as they all concurre in the creating of us: so they
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:14764:151"/>
shall in the judging of us: all of them shall co-operate together in the executing of justice and mercy; Justice in the damnation of the wicked, and mercy in the salvation of the godly.</p>
                  <p>You will object peradventure, that the Scripture seemeth to <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> speake otherwise, though <hi>Iudgement</hi> here be attributed essensial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God, in some places it is attributed personally to Christ; <hi>Hee shall judge the quicke and the dead:</hi> and therefore oftentimes it is called in the Scripture, <hi>the Ivdgement seat of Christ,</hi> as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 10.</note> 10. Againe, sometimes this worke of Judging is appropriated to the Saints: <hi>Know yee not that the Saints shall judge the world? 1 Cor.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 3.</note> 6. 2. and by and by againe, <hi>Know you not that we shall judge the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?</hi> verse 3. How shall we reconcile these, when it is said, Christ and the Saints shall judge?</p>
                  <p>I answer; This threefold doubt is reconciled by a threefold <note place="margin">Answ.</note> distinction. God is said to <hi>judge,</hi> if wee respect the Authority of Jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>Christ is said to <hi>judge</hi> if we respect the Promulgation of the sentence.</p>
                  <p>The Saints are said to <hi>judge,</hi> if wee respect the Approbation.</p>
                  <p>The power and right are equally given to all three Persons: but the particular Execution is given to Christ: the Approbation of <note place="margin">How Christ is said to be the Judge.</note> what Christ doth, is ascribed to the Saints. As at our common Courts of Assize here: one is set upon the Bench as Judge, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are joyned in commission with him, as Accessories: the Judge only pronounceth the sentence, and they that sit in Commission with him, ratifie and approve his sentence that he pronounceth: so at that day, Christ shall sit upon his Throne as <hi>Iudge;</hi> the Saints they shall joyne as Commissioners: Christ he alone pronounceth the sentence upon every one that is summoned there to the tryall; but then his Apostles and Saints, that are joyned in commission with him (for <hi>such honour have all his Saints)</hi> they shall ratifie and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and give attestation to the sentence that he pronounceth, and say <hi>Amen</hi> to the condemnation of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>So that the difference is easily reconciled, and we see how God and Christ, and the Saints are said to judge. The Authoritie is Gods. The Execution, Christs. The Approbation, the Saints. The Apostle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16. makes the point plaine, hee telleth us that <hi>God shall judge by Christ; In that day God shall judge the secrets</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>of all hearts by Iesus Christ:</hi> So Christ himselfe <hi>Ioh. 5. The Father</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>judgeth no man, but hath committed all power to the Sonne.</hi> Hee hath given him power to execute <hi>judgement,</hi> as he is the <hi>Sonne of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why to him? <note place="margin">Why God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the power of the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>cution of Judgement to Christ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this Reason. That his second comming may be in glory, to make amends for his first comming in humilitie. Christ at his first comming into the world, he came meanly, and homely: at his second comming, hee shall come triumphantly and gloriously.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:14764:152"/>
Before he came like a <hi>Lambe,</hi> then he shall come like a <hi>Lyon.</hi> Before, <hi>in the forme of a servant,</hi> then in the forme of a <hi>Lord.</hi> Before, <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> sate upon the Bench, and Christ stood as a malefactour: but then <hi>Pilate</hi> shall stand at the Barre as a Malefactour, and Christ shall sit on the Bench as Judge. Hee shall then openly come to shew himselfe a just <hi>Iudge</hi> amongst men, as before he came to be judged: when he came privately he was judged of them that were unjust: It was once a scorne that he, <hi>the Sonne of man,</hi> should bee <hi>Iudge</hi> of the world: therefore God will have him come and appeare in that very <hi>forme</hi> he was scorned in, that now they may behold him in his Majestie, that before would not take notice of him, when hee appeared in humilitie: that they who the more contemptuously before esteemed him in his basenesse, may now more severely tast of his justice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God then is Iudge.</hi> Not men. Not Angels, but God himselfe. Had men beene our Judges, we might not feare the face of men, because they are vessels of the same earth as wee, tooke out of the same pit, hewen out of the same rocke. If Angels had beene our Judges, wee should not have stood in so much feare, because (though they be Spirits more glorious then we, yet by their owne confession) they are our fellow creatures, and our <hi>fellow servants;</hi> therefore we after a sort participate with them in some degree of nature. But neither men nor Angels shall be Judges then, but Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that as much excelleth men and Angels, as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens doe the earth.</p>
                  <p>And looke what is necessarily required to the office of a <hi>Iudge,</hi> it is incomparably found in him. <note place="margin">Three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties requi site in a Judge.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the office of a <hi>Iudge,</hi> there are three properties specially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.
<list>
                        <item>Knowledge to discerne.</item>
                        <item>Power to determine.</item>
                        <item>Justice to execute.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>In God, these are all of them transcendent and emminent.<list>
                        <item>For Knowledge, he is the most wise.</item>
                        <item>For Power, most absolute.</item>
                        <item>For Execution, most just.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Knowledge to discerne,</hi> that is the first. He that assumeth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <note place="margin">1. Knowledge to discerne.</note> of a <hi>Iudge,</hi> must needs be one of wisedome and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Though he have the Scepter of authority in his hand, if hee have not the eye of wisedome in his head, if he be not able when men plead their case before him, as the <hi>two Harlots</hi> before <hi>Solomon,</hi> to decide to whom the right of the case belongeth, as hee, to whom the <hi>living child</hi> pertained, he is as unfit to be a <hi>Iudge,</hi> as an illiterate Ignaroe is to be a Priest. The <hi>Iudges</hi> ignorance is the honest mans overthrow. We commonly paint Justice blind, not
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:14764:152"/>
because he should be so that sits in Gods seat of Justice to decide Cases, but only in respect of persons. Blind <hi>Isaac</hi> was faine to put forth his hands to feele whether it were <hi>Esau</hi> or no, that came to aske the blessing: it is a hard case, when <hi>Iudges</hi> have sore eyes, that they cannot discerne the right Case, but only by feeling. But it shall not be so here. <hi>God is the Iudge,</hi> that is of infinite wisedome and understanding, that is able to discerne right and wrong. Of necessitie it must be so, because he is Omniscient, hee knoweth all things: he hath the true understanding of them: it is impossible to deceive him. Earthly <hi>Iudges</hi> they sometime are blinded in the hearing of Cases that are brought before them, for what their eyes see not, they are not able to discerne, there are not glasse win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes into the bosomes and breasts of men, by which they are able to come into their hearts: all the information they have, is from Evidences and Witnesses, the hear-sayes, and reports of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: where if any thing bee concealed or mistold, how easily may they miscarry? But Gods knowledge is not so unsound or uncertaine, because he himselfe is an eare, and an eye-witnesse of all things that are: he knoweth whatsoever is done, he beholdeth, not the actions only, but the very intentions, he is able to judge of the <hi>thoughts and intentions of the heart.</hi> It is but folly to thinke to hide any thing from him: heaven is not so high, but he can reach it: hell is not so deepe, but hee can search it: the earth is not so wide, but hee can span it: the night is not so darke, but he can see it: the chamber, the bed, the close<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, is not so close, but hee can pierce it: Hee that <hi>sitteth upon the circle of the heavens,</hi> and <hi>whose eyes are as flames of fire,</hi> seeth everything, <hi>Heb. 4. There is no creature</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>that is not manifest in his sight, but all things are naked and open;</hi> like an Anatomized body, (for thence the Metaphor is drawne) where the bowels are laid open, and every nerve and muscle, and liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, every Atome discovered, so that we may take a full view of it. In a word; if it were <hi>Davids</hi> commendation, that he <hi>was wise, as an Angell of God:</hi> how wise must God be, that infuseth wisdome into the Angels, and in <hi>whose sight the Angels are foolish?</hi> That is the first thing requisite in a <hi>Iudge,</hi> he must have knowledge to discerne.</p>
                  <p>In the second place. Hee must have <hi>power to execute:</hi> hee must <note place="margin">2. Power to execute.</note> have authoritie to command: and not be as an Image set against a wall, for if he be so, Abjects will insult over him: though perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture some may regard him, because hee hath eyes to see, yet others will contemne him, because hee hath no hands to punish: so innocencie shall be hopelesse of recompence, and the wicked of their desert. Againe, if he have not power, if hee have power only to heare, and not to determine: or if his power be restrained to some petty Cases, and not also extended to matters of greater consequence and moment: Appeales will bee made, (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:14764:153"/>
they are) from inferiour Courts to the higher.</p>
                  <p>But it is not so here. <hi>God is the Iudge,</hi> who as hee is infinite in knowledge, so he is in power and authority. Wee stile the King Supreame head over all persons, and in all causes in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but God is over all the Dominions of the earth, supreame over all: not only in all causes, and over all persons, but over all causes too: even Kings are subject to his regiment: <hi>Hee bindeth Kings in chaines, and Nobles in fetters of Iron,</hi> Psal. 149. <hi>The kings of</hi>

                  <p>Nay God, is not only over all the Kings of the earth, but he is Potentate of heaven and hell too: He hath a commanding power over all: the Angels feare, the Divels tremble, when they come to stand before God. In a word (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith) <hi>all power is of God;</hi> then of necessitie followeth, that God himselfe in his power is most absolute. That is the second thing belonging to the office of a <hi>Iudge,</hi> as he must have knowledge to discerne, so he must have <hi>power to execute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there must be <hi>Iustice in the Execution:</hi> therefore the Grecians were wont to place Justice betweene <hi>Libra,</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> to <note place="margin">3. Justice in the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> signifie indifferencie in weighing causes, and strictnesse in executing the sentence. So the Egyptians signified as much by their <hi>Hierogli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall</hi> portraiture of an Angell without hands, wincking, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eyes: such a one a <hi>Iudge</hi> should be: he should have no hands to receive bribes, nor no eyes to respect persons: the person of a <hi>Iudge</hi> must not take the person of a friend: A man must not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonate a friend in justice, but as <hi>Levi,</hi> he must <hi>know neither father, nor mother, nor brother.</hi> Justice amongst us, is portrayted holding a Ballance in one hand, and a sword in another: the Ballance shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the upright weighing of causes, and the Sword sheweth the strictnesse of the execution of the sentence.</p>
                  <p>And if this Execution be wanting, both the other are to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. It is to no purpose to know, and to have power, if there be not Justice. But God is a true and just <hi>Iudge;</hi> Howsoever it be amongst the <hi>Iudges</hi> of the earth; yet unworthy is he of the place of a <hi>Iudge,</hi> and fitter to stand at the Barre, then to sit on the Bench, that suffereth himselfe to miscarry by friendship or love, or bribes, or sutes, or favour, or envie; when either of these prevaile, they tie the tongues of men to plead for wrong causes. Shall a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour presume on the Kings favour, and <hi>Mordecai</hi> be out of the Kings grace? But there shall be no such thing here: <hi>God is the Iudge of all the earth, and shall not hee doe right?</hi> Gen. 18. <hi>Doth God pervert</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note>
                     <pb n="289" facs="tcp:14764:153"/>
                     <hi>judgement, or doth the Almigty pervert Iustice?</hi> Job 8. 3. When thou <note place="margin">Job 8. 3.</note> standest before the <hi>Iudgement seat of God,</hi> thou shalt neither be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated with vaine hopes, nor dejected and cast down by sinister and wrong feares: but assure thy selfe, such as thy cause is, such shall thy sentence be, as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> well; a pure heart shall prevaile more with God, then a smooth word: good consciences shall speed better then full purses, for he is an upright and just Judge, with whom no faire words, nor friends shall prevaile. So I have done with the first thing, <hi>The Iudge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, something of the <hi>Iudgement:</hi> and therein two <note place="margin">The Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> things;</p>
                  <p>First, that it shall be.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in what manner it shall be.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>that it shall be:</hi> The text is plaine. <hi>God shall bring to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. It shall be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> There might many Texts besides this be alledged conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and agreeable to this: but it is superfluous. Besides Texts of Scripture we have Types also to prefigure it; and reasons also to prove and confirmeit.</p>
                  <p>Two Types of the last Judgement, our Saviour himselfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth, <note place="margin">Types of the last Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Luke 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 17. One was the destruction upon <hi>Sodome:</hi> the other, the destruction that God brought upon the old world. Looke (as Christ saith) how it was with them of <hi>Sodome</hi> in the <hi>dayes of Lot, they did eat, they dranke, they bought, they sold, they plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they builded:</hi> and looke how it was with the men of the old world, <hi>in the dayes of Noah, eating and drinking, and sporting, and marrying, untill the very day that Noah entred into the Arke, and the flood came, and destroyed them all:</hi> So it shall be at the last day, <hi>when the Sonne of man shall come.</hi> The Apostle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> (speaking of the latter of these) telleth us of <hi>mockers in those times,</hi> that scoffed when they heard of the <hi>Iudgement:</hi> there hath beene talke a great while of such things promised, but <hi>when will it come? Where is the promise of his comming?</hi> There are scoffers in these dayes: but such (if there be any) cannot but speake against their owne conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and knowledge: they cannot be ignorant both of the <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> that have beene, and shall be (or if they be, they are wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant;) That God did once wash away the sinnes of the world with a Flood of water, and that the time is comming, that God will purge the sinnes of the world with a flood of fire: the <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi> in the cloudes, as it is a Monument of the one; so it is a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of the other. The two principall colours of the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> are blew, and red: the blew and waterish colour of the <hi>Rainbow</hi> is an evidence of that Judgement that is past, when God washed the sinnes of the world away by Water: the fiery colour is a predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a <hi>Iudgement</hi> that is to come, when God shall purge the world by a Flood of fire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:14764:154"/>
But besides these Types there are divers reasons that may be given to assure us, that we have reason to expect this day. Those five Attributes of God, afford five reasons to confirme it. His <hi>Power,</hi> his <hi>Wisedome,</hi> his <hi>Truth,</hi> his <hi>Iustice,</hi> his <hi>Mercie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First his <hi>Power;</hi> God will have it be thus, for the manifestation of his Power: A worke of great power it will be indeed. <hi>All must</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>be brought before Gods judgement seate,</hi> every one, as the Text saith after. It may seeme strange (peradventure incredible) to heare that all the men and women that ever lived in the world, that so many multitudes and millions of thousands of all <hi>kindreds and nations,</hi> should all be summoned to appeare before one <hi>Iudgement seat.</hi> But as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> saith, Consider who is the doer, and then thou wilt not doubt. It is true indeed with men, such a thing as this is impossible, <hi>but with God all things are possible.</hi> Could God at the first draw all things out of nothing, and cannot God as well bring together all againe, when they are turned to nothing? Could hee make that body of thine out of the dust of the earth, and cannot he raise that body, when it is turned to dust? Could hee unite that body to the soule in the time of the Creation, and cannot he unite it at the time of the Resurrection? Certainly there is nothing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, too hard, to the great and terrible voyce of God (as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith) to that voyce of God that <hi>cleaveth the rockes, that breakes the brazen gates asunder, that looseneth the bands of death.</hi> Therefore unlesse thou question the power of God, no doubt but he is able, and can <hi>bring all of us to judgement.</hi> Hee will doe it for the manifestation of his power.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as for the manifestation of his power, so for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation <note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> of his <hi>wisedome.</hi> It is a point of wisedome, when one hath made a thing, to bring it to the intended end for which hee made it. Beloved, this is Gods intended end in making of us: therefore he brought us hither into the world, not that we should have alwayes a Beeing here, but that after a certaine time wee should be dissolved, and put into an everlasting condition: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speaking of the salvation of Gods elect, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, <hi>the end of their faith:</hi> not only the end they aspire, but that end that God hath assigned, and appointed them to. If God should faile of his end, we might call his wisedome into question: it might give us occasion to say, that hee undertooke that, which he was not able to accomplish: so that in stead of shewing himselfe wise, he should shew himselfe weake. Therefore except we should call his wisedome into question, doubtlesse he will call us one day to an Account.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for the manifestation of <hi>his truth:</hi> nothing gaineth God more honour, then that he is faithfull and true, in whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> he hath promised. Now this <hi>day of Iudgement,</hi> is the day
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:14764:154"/>
wherein God hath promised to recompence the faith of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and hath threatned to punish the wickednesse of the wicked: <hi>hee hath appointed a day for it,</hi> saith the Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. What <note place="margin">Act. 17. 31.</note> though it be a great while since the promise was made: for all this we must not thinke <hi>that God is slacke, as men account slacknesse:</hi> the slacknesse of men is, when they keepe not their promise according to appointment: we must not thinke God is so slacke, he alwayes keepeth his day that he hath set, he never faileth of his promise, but when the time is come, he keepes touch, hee breakes not his day. As it is said <hi>Exod. 22. 41. After the foure hundred and thirty yeares were expired that God spake to Abraham, the very same day, all the children of Israel went out of Egypt.</hi> How many promises and threatnings after doe wee reade of, wherein he never failed of the performance of what he spake, the least tittle? therefore (saith Saint <hi>Gregorie)</hi> we have seene so many of Gods promises, already ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, that we may be confident, that those that are to come, shall also be accomplished: surely he will not faile in this, but as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as he hath promised, it shall come to passe. So that unlesse we shall denie <hi>the truth of God</hi> (who the Scripture saith, cannot, <hi>it is impossible that he should lie)</hi> we must of necessitie beleeve, that for the manifestation of his <hi>Truth</hi> there will bee a day of <hi>Iudgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, as for the manifestation of his <hi>Truth,</hi> so of his <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Reas. 4.</note> and <hi>Mercy.</hi> I will put them together. It is the propertie of Justice to render punishment to those that have done evill: and of Mercie to recompence those that have done well, Now therefore for the manifestation of his <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Mercie</hi> this day must come. It is true, here many times wicked men speed better then Gods people: A man may <hi>sinne a hundred times, and yet God prolong his dayes:</hi> and the children of God on the other side, are persecuted and neglected: so that here he giveth not retribution to every one according to his workes. Whereas it standeth with equity and justice, that well-doers should bee rewarded, and evill-doers should be punished; the streame runneth contrary, wicked men speed well, and good men ill: <hi>Naboth</hi> cannot have a poore <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi> but one rich <hi>Ahab</hi> or other is ready to get it away: <hi>They eate my people as bread:</hi> and they eate the bread of Gods people: they eate the inheritance of the fatherlesse, and <hi>devoure widowes houses:</hi> so that here all is turned topsie-turvey, as if the world were a thing cruciated, tearing it selfe. If this world should last alwayes, where were Gods <hi>justice?</hi> And therefore for the manifestation of Gods <hi>justice and mercie,</hi> there must be a day of retribution, when for that portion of sorrow that the godly have had here, they shall have a portion of happinesse and joy; and when for that cup of pleasure that the wicked have dranke here, they shall have put into their hands <hi>a cup of trembling and wrath.</hi> If <hi>Dives</hi> enjoy his
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:14764:155"/>
                     <hi>good things</hi> here, let him looke for a day, when he shall be denied a <hi>drop of water:</hi> If <hi>Lazarus</hi> have had his ill things here, let him looke when the day shall come, that he shall be rewarded. Except wee will divest, and strip God of all his Attributes, deny his <hi>power,</hi> his <hi>wisedome,</hi> his <hi>truth,</hi> his <hi>justice,</hi> and <hi>mercie,</hi> wee cannot but confesse, that certainly there is a day to come, when <hi>God will bring us to judgement.</hi> That is for the first. <hi>That the day of Iudgement shall come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place we are to consider, as that it shall be, so in <note place="margin">2. In what manner it shall be.</note> what manner, and how it shall be. Briefly; <hi>the manner of this Iudgement,</hi> is set forth to us in the Scripture in five particulars;</p>
                  <p>First, the <hi>Summons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>Appearance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Separation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Tryall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the <hi>Sentence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, the <hi>Summons.</hi> All shall bee summoned to come before <note place="margin">1. The sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> Gods Judgement seate: and this <hi>Summons</hi> of theirs shall be by the voyce of <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe: <hi>The dead in the grave shall heare the voyce of the Sonne of man, and they shall come forth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 28. This <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 28.</note> voyce in Scripture is called the <hi>Trump of the Angell; Hee shall send</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 24 31.</note> 
                     <hi>his Angels, and they shall gather the Elect together, from the foure windes.</hi> Mat. 24. 31. <hi>The trumpe shall blow, and the dead shall rise.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>The Lord himselfe shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voyce of the Archangell, with the Trumpe of GOD, and the dead shall rise.</hi> 1 Thes. 4. 16. At the giving of the Law, there was <note place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 16.</note> the sound of a Trumpet: so when God shall come to punish the breach of the Law, the Angell shall blow the Trumpet: Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets are commonly blowne at a Battell, or at a Feast: at a Feast they sound joyfully: when it is at a Battell they sound dreadfully: both shall sound here at that day, the sound of the Trumpet to the godly, shall be as at a Feast: but the sound of the Trumpet in the eares of the wicked, shall be as a summons to battell.</p>
                  <p>If wee will have the joyfull sound of that voyce then, we must welcome the voyce of Christ now: God now speakes by men, then by Angels: Now the Trumpet of the Gospell soundeth, then the Trumpet of Judgement shall sound: wee must learne obedience to this, and then wee shall find a great deale of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in that: there is a <hi>Surgite</hi> that wee must hearken to now, arise from sinne, <hi>Come unto me all yee that are weary, and heavy laden;</hi> if we hearken to this, we shall never feare that <hi>Surgite venite</hi> then, <hi>Arise you dead and come to judgement.</hi> That is the first. The <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>Appearance:</hi> after the <hi>Summons</hi> all shall make their <note place="margin">2. The Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</note> appearance: <hi>Wee must all appeare before the Iudgement seat of Christ.</hi>
                     <pb n="293" facs="tcp:14764:155"/>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. This Appearance it is generall, and personall: the <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 10.</note> generall, all must come: the particular, and personall, every one shall come in his owne person: <hi>Wee shall appeare</hi> for our selves, <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man for himselfe, shall give an account to God,</hi> Rom. 14. 12. In <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 12.</note> other Courts if men appeare for themselves by another, it is enough, but here, <hi>Per se,</hi> by himselfe. That is the reason that this day it is called in Scripture, <hi>the day of manifestation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, because Christ himselfe shall be revealed, and manifested in that day; <hi>Wee looke for the day of the Revelation of Iesus Christ,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cot. 1. 7.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because the Attributes of God shall bee revealed then; his <hi>patience,</hi> and <hi>longanimitie,</hi> his <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> and <hi>justice, a day of Revelation of the just judgement of God,</hi> Rom. 2.</p>
                  <p>Finally, because we our selves shall be revealed, and manifested, all our wayes and workes: the godly, and the workes that they have done, though never so secret: the wicked, and their workes, the secret sins that they have committed. That is the second thing in the manner of the Judgement. First, that all shall be summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; secondly, upon the Summons, all shall bee made to appeare.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Separation</hi> that shall be made at that time: for when <note place="margin">3. The sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> all are congregated, by and by, all shall be severed and separated: a separation and division shall be made amongst them: some shall <hi>be set at the right hand of the Iudge,</hi> some at the <hi>left hand: As a shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard searcheth his flocke, in the day when hee is amongst his sheepe that are scattered, so I will search out my sheepe at that day, and I will divide betweene cattell and cattell, betweene the sheepe and the goates.</hi> The <hi>Sheepe</hi> and the <hi>Goates</hi> here they flocke, feed, and fold together, they will doe so, they must doe so. The <hi>Tares</hi> here must be <hi>let alone,</hi> and grow with the <hi>corne,</hi> till the day of harvest, but yet afterward there shall be a division and <hi>a separation:</hi> the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and the godly live together here, but at the last the wicked shall be separated from the godly, like the <hi>chaffe</hi> from the <hi>wheate:</hi> as when two travell one way, they passe together, and lodge toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the next morning they part, and take severall wayes: so the wicked and the godly, after they have beene here a time, eating and drinking, conversing and living, and perhaps dying, and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the graves together, notwithstanding when this day, that I here speake of, shall come, then there shall be a <hi>separation</hi> and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion made, then the <hi>sheepe shall bee set on the right hand;</hi> then you shall know which is <hi>Iacobs</hi> flocke, and which is <hi>Labans;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Christ, and which belong to Sathan, then the <hi>chaffe</hi> shall be winnowed from the <hi>wheat,</hi> and wee shall see which is for the Barne, and which is for the fire.</p>
                  <p>Goe on, you wicked still, seeme the same you are not, delude the eyes of the world, that you have the same heart that you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:14764:156"/>
you have Maskes and Vizards now, the time will come your paint shall be washed off, your fig-leaves shall bee stripped, and your nakednesse shall be seene, and all manifest at that day of God: there shall be a <hi>separation</hi> of the good from the bad, as the <hi>shepheard separateth his sheepe from the Goates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, with this separation, there shall be a <hi>tryall</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">4. The tryall.</note> speakes of: after the conventing and separation, there shall be a tryall. <hi>I saw</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> Revel. 20. 12.) <hi>the dead, small and great stand before God, and the bookes were opened, and another booke was opened, which is the booke of life, and the dead were judged out of those</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 20. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>things, which were written in those bookes, according to their workes.</hi> Marke, there are severall bookes, and so as there are severall books, there are severall judgements, some are tryed by one booke some by another.</p>
                  <p>First, there are some bookes, by which the workes of men are tryed: the booke of Nature, the booke of Scripture, the booke of <note place="margin">The Bookes that shall be opened at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Conscience. They that neuer heard of Christ shall be judged by the booke of Nature: there is enough in the booke of Nature to leave all unexcusable. They that live in the Church shall be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and judged by the booke of the Scripture: Of the Law, <hi>They that have sinned under the Law, shall be judged by the Law:</hi> Of the Gospell, <hi>God shall judge the secrets of all hearts according to my Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</hi> Both of them shall be judged according to the booke of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: for God will lay that booke so cleare and open, that they shall see what they have done against that Booke. Lord, what a many of sinnes have we committed here, that we never remember and thinke of, when they are done. Our memorie and conscience now is a Book clasped up, we see not a thousand things that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred there: but when God shall lay open that Booke, and in large our memories, and inlighten our consciences, then men shall clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see, what they had forgot before: they shall promptly dictate the whole course of our lives, and acquaint us with every action that hath past us, and every circumstance, to accuse and excuse. This is the kind of the tryall, by which the workes of men shall be tryed.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, with the <hi>Summons</hi> there shall be an <hi>appearance,</hi> and with <note place="margin">5. The Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</note> that a <hi>separation,</hi> and a <hi>tryall,</hi> after all these are done, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the <hi>sentence,</hi> then the <hi>Sentence</hi> shall be pronounced upon the one, and upon the othet: the one <hi>Sentence</hi> full of sweetnesse and comfort, every word droppeth as a honey combe; <hi>Come you bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of my Father, inherit the kingdome prepared for you, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world:</hi> The same voyce that Christ spake to them here, <hi>Come to me;</hi> the same shall be there, <hi>Come yee blessed:</hi> and as they were carefull to come to Christ here, so they shall make a happy comming to Christ there.

                        <p>Yea, in the way of thy Iudgements, O Lord, have wee waited for thee: the desire of our soule is to thy Name, and to the remembrance of thee.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Chapter is a sweet song of the Prophet (if I mistake not) concerning the restauration of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> And the words of the Text, are the sweet Swan-like song of our deceased Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, which she desired might be her <hi>Funerall song,</hi> her <hi>Funerall text,</hi> at this time: and desired it long agoe, before any thing, that is now fallen out, came to passe. And I have accordingly pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched uponit: not only to satisfie her desire in a just thing: but especially, because I approve her choyce of a fit Text; there being not in the whole Scripture, a portion that will afford a fitter Character (in my apprehension) for her person: as you shall understand in the close, to which therefore I shall deferre the speaking to the present occasion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="320" facs="tcp:14764:159"/>
The truth is, I have handled a good part of this chapter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and in this place: but now wee shall cleane goe another way then then I did, and then I usually doe. I shall only desire to present so much out of these words without any curious observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or division, as may represent to us <hi>a perfect character of a sweet Christian-minded man or woman:</hi> which may bee of singular use, and very profitable.</p>
                  <p>There be onely two things, that I shall observe in the whole <note place="margin">The generall things obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in the words.</note> words? I shall but goe them over briefly, taking out the maine points (as I conceive) for that purpose, I shall mention them.</p>
                  <p>We have here propounded to to us <hi>the compleat dutie of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. The dutie.</note> And wee have here some effectuall motives intimated to <note place="margin">2. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</note> stirre Christians up to the performance of that duty.</p>
                  <p>There is <hi>a generall dutie</hi> (to begin with that first) that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">The duty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest,</note> to Christians at all times. And there are some <hi>speciall duties</hi> which concerne Christians in some speciall times. Both contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">1. Generally.</note> here. <note place="margin">2. Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>generrll dutie</hi> (I shall not, as I said, handle it in my former way of observation, but only explicate the very words of the Text, and that will be enough for me.) The generall duty (I say) of a Christian, and what should bee the temper of his heart, and <note place="margin">The generall dutie expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> spirit at all times, we may find expressed (at least intimated) very sweetly, with some excellent directions in the Text, in these three circumstances.</p>
                  <p>First, we may see here what is the true Object, upon which a <note place="margin">1. In the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</note> Christian soule should be fixed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we may see the Latitude of the Acts which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <note place="margin">2. In the Acts that are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised on the Object.</note> must exercise upon that Object.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we may take notice, of the manner, and of the degree in which every one of those Acts must bee exercised. I shall but <note place="margin">3. In the manner of exercising.</note> touch these briefly out of the words, and then come to the <hi>speciall duties,</hi> belonging to speciall times.</p>
                  <p>First, to begin with the <hi>Object. The desire of our soule is toward</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The Object.</note> 
                     <hi>thee, and to the remembrance of thy Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God, and the name of God,</hi> is that, which should be printed in the heart of a Christian: should be that to which the byas and streame of his whole soule runnes.</p>
                  <p>First, I say, it should be fixed upon God. Wee are here in the world placed (as it were) betweene heaven and earth: Now all <note place="margin">1. God.</note> the matter is, how our Byas is set, which way that turnes. As the Byas is of the heart, so the man is. Our hearts may bee turned downwards to the earth, and to earthly things, and so wee shall runne a course of ruine and destruction: our hearts againe, the Byas of them, may be set toward heaven, and heavenly things, and so we shall runne the right course that wee ought. It is God
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:14764:159"/>
that our soules should breath after. <hi>Fecisti nos, Domine, propter te,</hi> saith a Father: thou hast made us, O Lord, for thy selfe, and our soules are restlesse till they returne againe to thee.</p>
                  <p>As they say of Circles. The Circle, the round figure, is the <note place="margin">Simile.</note> most perfect figure, and the most capacious figure, because there the line that beginneth in one point goeth round, till it returne into the same againe. So this is the greatest perfection of a man, when he returneth to his beginning: he had all from God, and when he reflects himselfe altogether backe againe unto God, hee attaineth his greatest perfection.</p>
                  <p>And indeed there will bee no more rest for the soule in any thing out of God, then there is for a stone, or a weighty body in the liquid ayre. Hang a stone in the Ayre, and doe but once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move <note place="margin">Simile.</note> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>orce that holds itthere, will it, nill it, give but a way to it, and it will cut through, and never rest, till it come to a sollid substance, till it come to the earth, if it may to the Center of the earth. It is so with the soule of man: trie it in all the fortunes, and states, and conditions in the world, as a great Emperour said, I have runne through all things, and my spirit will rest in nothing: and as <hi>Solomon</hi> giveth us this observation out of all his travell, and experiment that he had made; <hi>Vanity of vanity, all is vanity,</hi> and worse then vanity too, <hi>vexation of spirit? this is the summe of all; feare God, and keepe his commandenents;</hi> as he concludeth.</p>
                  <p>This is the Object, upon which our soule should bee set, wee should have an eye to God; labouring to approve our selves to him: making our approaches, and adresses, and returnes to him; that our soule may re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> with him, that we may enjoy the light of his countenance here, and the fulnesse, and brightnesse of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hereafter. This is the first thing in the Object.</p>
                  <p>Now, if a soule be carryed toward this Object, toward God; <note place="margin">2. The name of God.</note> and we can out-goe, and out-grow these worldly things, looke abovethem, and looke downe upon them with scorne: then the very <hi>name of God</hi> will be sweet, and precious to us. <hi>To thee, and to thy name.</hi> Every thing which is a memoriall, a remembrance of God; Every thing by which God may be knowne, will be taken notice of. All his Attributes, his Word, and Ordinances, and all other things which come within the compasse of his <hi>Name</hi> (as I suppose there are not many here but know, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary explication of Divines, of the third commandement, <hi>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine,</hi> and the first Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>hallowed be thy name;</hi> What is meant by the <hi>name of God)</hi> When the heart (I say) is set upon God, it will even leape for joy at the very <hi>name of God:</hi> the very <hi>name of God</hi> will bee sweet to him. To enjoy God is sweet, and to have but a glimpse of him, to have him but represented by name, is sweet too. As it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:14764:160"/>
of a Father, that was a godly man, and a Martyr in his time: that he was so frequent in roling the name of Christ, the name of Jesus in his mouth, that when hee died, it is reported that in his heart there was ingraven, and written, the character of that Name in golden letters. And as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> speakes of himselfe; <hi>Time was</hi> (saith he) <hi>that I found infinite sweetnesse, it was honey to mee to reade a peece of Tully, there was so much eloquence in it: but after I came to bee a Christian, to be acquainted with God, and with Christ, then, me thought, the leaves were drie, and the beauty withered; I found no such sappe, nor rellish in them.</hi> And he giveth the reason: <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>I did not there find the name of my blessed Lord: they did not bring to my remembrance, they were not Vehicula; instruments, to convey to my soule, something of my God:</hi> Therefore all that Eloquence vanished, and it was but an empty sound: like a Cart that runnes with speed, rattleth, and makes a great noise when it is emptie: so all the goodly sound of words, when there is nothing of God carryed along with it, that puts us in mind of God, it will have but little savour and rellish to a pious heart. But I must not dilate upon things, lest I prevent my selfe in what I more intend. This is the first thing, that I note here: the <hi>Object</hi> upon which we should place our hearts and soules: they should bee <hi>toward God, and toward his Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then secondly, here is intimated in these words, nay, and <note place="margin">The Acts that are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised on the Object.</note> directly exprest, the <hi>Acts</hi> which a Christian should exercise upon this <hi>Object.</hi> There are three <hi>Acts</hi> that are here mentioned: (for the whole soule must be taken up, and carried with full streame toward God in all the parts and faculties of it, and so wee have it here clearely exprest.)</p>
                  <p>First, here is an act of the Understanding, the intellectuall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie <note place="margin">1. Of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</note> mentioned: <hi>Our remembrance is toward thy name.</hi> There is a <hi>remembrance of God and his name.</hi> And this should bee one thing which a Christian should take speciall care of. Our memories <note place="margin">Memorie.</note> should not be like sives, to let out the cleare water, and to returne the graines and the dregges: We should not have that treasurie to preserve rubbish, but to preserve our Jewels: as when there was a dispute before <hi>Alexander</hi> that great King, concerning a rich Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, that he tooke amongst his spoiles, when hee had overthrowne <hi>Darius</hi> King of Persia, the richest Cabinet of the most costly Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, that the world had then seene: there was a dispute before him, to what use he should put it: and every one having exprest their mindes according as their fancies lead them: the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe concluded, that he would keepe that Cabinet to be a treasurie to lay the bookes of <hi>Homer</hi> in. I am sure, the richest Cabinet that is, is in the soule of a man, the memorie, which is the treasure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house where we lay up all that we know and learne: it is a rich
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:14764:160"/>
Cabinet I confesse, and therefore the fitter for the richest Jewell: to lay up the word of God there: as <hi>Marie, treasured up those things shee heard in her heart:</hi> to lay up the <hi>remembrance of God there:</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to thinke upon God.</p>
                  <p>It is a very sweet saying of a learned and godly Father: <hi>A man should oftener remember God then hee doth breath.</hi> As the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is maintained by exportation, and importation of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities; so is our life maintained by a continuall exportation, and importation of the Ayre, passing to and fro: breathing out the Ayre, when it is too hot in us, and fetching it in coole againe, to refresh and supply the spirits: our life (I say) is maintained by it: and God is the very fountaine of life to us: even as the soule is the life of the body, so is God the life of the soule, therefore we should alwayes be remembring of God, so oft as wee breath: breathing out prayers to him, or prayses of him in returne of his mercie.</p>
                  <p>Our memories (I say) should be exercised in thinking upon God, in remembring of God; <hi>Remember thy Creatour, in the dayes of thy youth,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon:</hi> We should begin betimes, and wee should never be weary of this. The memorie is one of the brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlest parts, and we are most apt in age to grow to oblivion and forgetfulnesse: as that great Oratour did sometime, it is reported of him, that his memory (which was incomparably excellent before) failed him so much before he died, that he forgat his owne name. Wee cannot forget God, but we must be worse then hee, and doe that first, forget our owne name, that wee are Christians, that wee are sonnes and daughters of God. Therefore this should be a thing, that we should often inure our selves unto, not to put the thoughts of God from us, or thinke they are too sad and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and so to account them as unwelcome guests: but we should rather often, bath our selves in these sweet delights, in the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and remembrance of God. That is one thing.</p>
                  <p>And then secondly; besides the act of the understanding (I <note place="margin">2. Of the will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> will goe according to the words of the text) there is an act of the will, and of the affections: one onely named as a tast of all the rest: for indeed wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e one is, all are, they are so linked and chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, that they cannot be separate: And here is a sweet act of affection mentioned; <hi>The desire of our soule is toward thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This should be one part of a Christians character, that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires <note place="margin">Desires.</note> should be alwayes breathing out, and flaming up towards heaven: that if he cannot at least obtaine the highest pitch of full sayles of love, and of a full perfection in vertue and grace: yet, whatsoever he commeth short in otherwise, to make it up with abundant desires, ardent longing desires: not to come short in that to be sure: that will make an excellent supply.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:14764:161"/>
And indeed, it is that, that poore and weake Christians must trust to many times, must relieve themselves with thoughts of: they often find themselves exceeding short, and defective in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances: if they did not find some desires working in them, there would scarse be any symptome of life. As it may be in the body: a man can see sometimes, but little motion in the body: scarse any symptome of life, the pulse is very weake and faint, and scarse moveth at all that can be discerned: but yet it may be there is some kind of breath stirring, or else we conclude the party, dead: so it is in this case: desire is that (if there be truth in it, be it the lowest degree of it) which is an evidence of spirituall life: there cannot be truth of grace, where there is not unfeigned, and hearty desires toward God, desires to approve our selves to him, desires to walke with him in our whole course, desires to bee defective in nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that is in some sort true (as you know Divines have determined it, and if it be not mis-interpreted, there is a certaine truth in it) <hi>the desire of grace, is the grace it selfe:</hi> and the desire of <note place="margin">Desires, an argument of a gracious heart.</note> God, is that which makes some union, and giveth us some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowship with God. For it is impossible that the heart should desire, and long after God, except it bee, that the heart be pointed with love toward God, except the heart love God: for desire is nothing but a certaine configuration of love: Love is the generall affection of the soule to any thing that is good, in all the postures of it. Now if it fall out that the good thing I love, be absent from me, that I have it not in possession, then love is shaped out, and sheweth it selfe in desires. It must needes be therefore, that where there are desires toward God, and desires of grace, there is somewhat of God formed in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, there is something of grace begun: at least the first lineaments thereof are drawne in some kind of truth. This is the second Act that Christians should exercise, and take speciall care to cherish: that they have continuall pantings, and breathings of desires to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God: their hearts should worke, and beate toward him continually.</p>
                  <p>But then in the third place, there is another thing expressed in the words of the Text, and that is, these desires are not only (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">Joyned with endeavours.</note> to our Proverbe of wishers and woulders) ineffectuall desires: desires that are meere gaping, to see if the thing will drop into our mouthes or no without any bestirring of our selves: but here is joyned with them (if wee peruse the words of the Text, we shall find it) endeavours: <hi>I have desired thee in the night, and I will seeke thee early:</hi> the soule of a Christian desires God in the evening, and his spirit will seeke him early in the morning (for those particulars of the time, I shall touch by and by, but now I only take notice of that third distinct act here mentioned, which
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:14764:161"/>
is,) our desires must be joyned with inquiries, with indeavours, to search after God, to see if we may grope by any meanes to find him out, to learne to know what is the way of his good will and pleasure, how we may lead a life that may be acceptable to him, and how we may come to the possession, and assurance of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and be accepted in his sight. Except there be endeavours it <note place="margin">Desires with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, false.</note> is a shrewd suspition, that the desires are ineffectuall desires, and unformed desires: and not those that argue any life, and truth of grace. But when our desires are joyned with these bestirrings of the soule, to seeke after God, to search him out in his Word, in his Ordinances, to find his steps, and to find his goings, and so to maintaine a sweet and holy communion with him: that is a sweet act of grace, and a certaine ratification, and seale of the truth of it.</p>
                  <p>But then, let me adde the third thing. In what height are all <note place="margin">The manner of exercising these acts.</note> these actions to be boyled up? or in what manner must we tender these services to God in this kind? How must our understandings lay hold upon God, and treasure him up in our memories<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How must our affections and desires worke toward him? how must our endeavours be carryed toward God? The manner of all these will make this compleat, and so make up the full and compleat <hi>Character of a Christian,</hi> in this generall dutie.</p>
                  <p>First, the soule must be carried intimatly, and most inwardly: <note place="margin">1. They must come from inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> the inward motions and workings of the soule and spirit must bee toward God. And therefore the Prophet here expresseth these acts, as the acts of the very soule and spirit of a man.</p>
                  <p>All outward actions of seeking toward God, and making our approaches and addresses toward him, they are all such as may be counterfeited, a hypocrite may act them. There is nothing in the world, no shape of any externall thing in the world; but a Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with his pensill can draw the picture of it, give a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the thing: and there is no outward action in the world, that belongeth to God, or to Christianitie, but it is possible for a Painter, for a base hypocrite to represent them with an artificiall pensill. But the inward acts of life, that no Painter can imitate: a Painter cannot make a picture to have heart, and entrailes, and lunges, to have life and motion, and spirits, and bloud stirring in the veines: all those things a Painter cannot imitate; he can make shapes, but he cannot put the life into them: he can make outward formes, but he cannot put the inwards to them. Now then this is that intended here: all those outward actions must bee animated actions; not dead actions, actions that have no further bottome then the teeth outwards, that grow upon the house toppe: a word growing upon the tippe of the tongue, that hath no roote in the heart, and so for the rest. But they must have the roote in the heart and soule of a man; that must inwardly be carried towards
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:14764:162"/>
God. And when the heart and soule, and spirit of a man (all which words are here used) by a supernaturall grace that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in them, when (I say) they are thus carried toward God, it is an argument of spirituall life; that there is some life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they must be carried sincerely, not for any by, or <note place="margin">2. They must be sincere.</note> base respects. When a man makes toward any person or thing, and professes love to it: and doth it not for the thing it selfe, but for some by end: he doth not love that person he makes to, but he loveth that thing for whom he makes to that person. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: A man scrapeth and croucheth, and keepes a doe with a <note place="margin">Simile.</note> man, that he never saw or knew, one that he is ready, it may bee (when his backe is turned) to curse: but yet he will doe this for his almes, for his gaine, to make a prey, a use of him some way: this man loveth his almes, loveth his prey, loveth his bounty: but it is no argument of love to the man. So it is in this case: for a man to make toward God, and to seeme to owne him, and to be one of the generation of those that <hi>seeke his face,</hi> to addresse himselfe in outward conformitie, and many other things, by which another may charitably (if hee have no other ground) judge of him: all this is nothing, except a man may discerne some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may give him a tast, that his spirit doth uprightly, and sincerely seeke God; that he loveth God, for God himselfe; that he loveth grace, for grace it selfe; hee loveth the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, because they are Gods commandements, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are beautifull, being according to the rule of his Word. But otherwise, if it be any sinister thing, that carrieth a man on toward God, it is no argument of the life, and truth of grace. You know it is so in experience: there be many things that move, and yet their motion is no argument of life: A wind-mill, when the wind serveth, moveth, and moveth very nimbly too: <note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet you doe not say presently that that is a living creature: No, it moveth only by an externall cause, by an artificiall contrivance; it is so framed, that when the wind setteth in such and such a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it will move, and so having but an externall Moter, and cause to move, and no inward principle, no soule within it to move it, it is an argument that it is no living creature. So it is here: if a man see another move, and move very fast, in those things which of themselves are the wayes of God, see him move as fast to heare a Sermon as his neighbour doth; is as forward and hastie to thrust himselfe, and bid himselfe a guest to the Lords Table, (when God hath not bid him) as any; the Question is, what principle sets him aworke: if it be an inward principle of life, out of a sincere affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and love to God and his ordinances that carrieth him to this: it argueth that man hath some life of grace. But if it bee some wind that bloweth him on; the wind of State, the wind of Law,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:14764:162"/>
the wind of danger, of penaltie, the wind of fashion or custome, to doe as his neighbours doe: if these or such like, bee the things that draw him thither; this is no argument of life at all: it is a cheape thing, it is counterfeit, and poore ware.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, (that which I have often said to be the principall, and <note place="margin">3. They must be pitched on God alone.</note> the most considerable thing (that I know) in all practicall Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and which is the most Charactaristicall, of the truth of Grace, and of the life of Pietie in any one) our spirits, and soules, and affections towards God, must be advanced to this height: to be carried toward God aboue all other things.</p>
                  <p>I beseech you seriously thinke of it: I have often spoken of it, but it may be there may be some roome left for the mention of it now, and some necessitie of pondering it well. It will bee the Charactaristicall thing, by which a man may most certainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne himselfe. And I would desire to know wherein my defect of understanding is, if I be mistaken: but it seemes to me as a cleare thing that every one here, that hath not a mind to affront the mind of God, he dares not contest this argument, that it is a rationall thing, that if God be the best of Beeings, he should have the best portion in our love.</p>
                  <p>All reason commands us to love that best, which is best: and to dispense our love according to the degree of the excellencie of the thing. There is no man but apprehendeth this clearely. A man may say that he loves his Wife, and he will prove it: and this shall be his argument, I love her aswell, as I doe another woman. Is this the proofe of conjugall love? was this the covenant made betweene them? hath hee fulfilled it in this case to her? or she to him? There is no man but seeth that there is more required: there is a peculiarity, and proprietie of love required in this case. It must certainly be so here: for we contract and espouse our soules to Christ, and upon those very termes, for better, and for worse, to forsake all the world, and to cleave to him alone: and if our spirits be not raised and advanced to that degree of affection, that Christ and God be so lovely, and beautifull, in our eyes, and so good (for I name one sometime, and sometime another, it is all one upon the point) if (I say) they be not advanced thus high: the conjugall knot was never tied betweene Christ and the soule: it is impossible therefore that such a one should have to plead the benefits that flow from a Conjugall union: neither can hee have title or right to any thing that issueth from a marriage with Christ, whose soule did but equivocate, and would never speake out the words, and who never answered the interrogations of a good conscience (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speakes in another case) that when the soule (in the contract) should say, that she takes him for to love; and honour, and obey him, and to make him her Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:14764:163"/>
if the soule doe not yeeld to this, which it cannot doe, if it doe not esteeme him the best of all others, and that all others are to bee thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> away, and to be forsaken in comparison of him. This is the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> circumstance I have noted hence, which I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is intimated in these words: Though I have not said it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest here, yet it is so carryed with such a fulnesse <hi>(the desire of our soule is to thee, and to the remembrance of thy name)</hi> as if it were to God only, or at least, to him principally. But I must hasten.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place. It must be a universall love, and so a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall <note place="margin">4. They must bee univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall.</note> obedience (which is the fruit of it) which must justifie the truth of our affections towards God, and set the heart in a right frame and temper. Except a man love God, and love all the wayes of God, and all the ordinances of God, and yeeld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in subjection, and resigne himselfe in obedience to them all: if he doe but reserve, and make choyce of any one sinne, to lie and wallow, and tumble in, he doth evacuate all the other good, hee throweth downe all the other good with that one evill. Will you come and plead with God, that there is but one sinne that you have defiled and polluted your soule with, and wallowed and tumbled in all your life, and I hope, God will never refuse me, or barre me out of his presence, and fellowship and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him for that? Yes, you are as filthy, all over as filthy and defiled, and abominable, and odious to his eye, and to every other sense, aswell with one, as if you had beene in ten thousand slowghes one after another. And as the Philosopher speakes, a Cuppe, or some such thing, that hath a hole in it, is no Cuppe, it will hold nothing, and therefore cannot performe the use of a cup, though it have but one hole in it: so if the heart have but one hole in it; if it retaine the divell but in one thing: as we use to say, In law, one man in possession, keepes possession, and a man can never have true possession, till he have voyded all: so, except all be rooted out and exterpated, and a man commeth to yeeld a full and absolute subjection to Christ universally, Christ hath no part or portion in us, nor we in him. <note place="margin">5. They must be constant.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, (there were divers other particulars, that I thought to have added in this: but I see I must passe them over) It is not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry affection, that may seeme to have some height and universality, though I doe acknowledge that they will in some measure chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cterise out the truth, but yet there must be this addition: as it was with the feed that was cast into the good ground, it had depth of earth: so this must have depth in the heart, it must be well rooted, and fastned for perpetuity: it must be a constant affection, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and established in the heart. The Ayre (you know) is light, <note place="margin">Simile.</note> and yet we call it not a lightsome body, because it is lighted by the presence of another, and when that light body is removed it is
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:14764:163"/>
darke, you may say it is darke, for the Ayre is darke in the night, when the Sunne is absent, as it is light: when the Sunne is present: those we call lightsome bodyes, whose light is originated, and rooted in themselves. So it is in this case: such are not godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that may have some injections of godly thoughts, and godly affections cast into them, and be in them for a spurt, and for a brunt, and for a little flash (like a flash of lightning in the Ayre) and gone away againe presently: but it must be rooted and grounded in a man, so as that it will continue, continue so as that the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of graces and duties toward God should be frequent and quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian: as it is here in the Text: <hi>The desire of our soule is to thee in the evening, and our spirit shall seeke thee early in the morning:</hi> Morning and evening, frequently, daily, to have commerce and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, to walke with him, to set our selves in his presence, and to approve our selves to him, to make it our constant trade to doe so, to be Gods dayes-men, to worke by the day with him, and withall to be constant to hold out for perpetuity.</p>
                  <p>Onely time can discover truth: and truth is the daughter of time to us: God knoweth it before, but wee can never know, but by the holding out, but by the perpetuity. I acknowledge there is a great difference betweene that which the Scripture calleth tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary faith, and that which it calleth saving faith: there is (I say) a great difference: they doe not only differ in this, that the one holdeth out, and the other doth not hold out: but they differ in their vitall principles, by vertue of which one holdeth out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath a more noble nature in it: and the other, because it is a slighter timbered thing, it doth not hold out: because the one is a reall, and true, and substantiall beautie of grace, the other but a superficiall and painted beautie: substantiall beauty, that is founded upon nature, upon our complexion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it raine or shine, it will hold out in both: but painted beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, one feares a little wet will alter the painting, another, lest a little heate should doe it. A painted beauty will not hold, but true will hold. And they that doe love true, love long, as our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb saith: I am certaine it is so here, they who doe once love God truly, love God for ever.</p>
                  <p>I will dispatch the rest in a word. There be some speciall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <note place="margin">The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar duties.</note> besides these generalls, which make the generall character of a Christian: I say there are some speciall duties, that doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne him according to the speciallity of times.</p>
                  <p>Now there is a double time, and so a double posture of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, in which accordingly he hath severall suites of graces, to put on, and to exercise.</p>
                  <p>There is a double dealing of God (which is the foundation of it) God dealeth sometime in a way of mercie and favour toward
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:14764:164"/>
his servants: and God dealeth sometime in a way of judgement, and wrath, and displeasure: and he doth so, (though not as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie Judge, but as a father that is angrie) even with his owne servants.</p>
                  <p>Now accordingly, as this generall temper, and frame of spirit, <note place="margin">In times of mercie.</note> should be at all times; so it should shew and discover it selfe, in those severall times. In the time when God sheweth favour, then <note place="margin">1. Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> the servant of God is to serve God so much the more chearfully, <note place="margin">2. Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> and so much the more fruitfully: <hi>to runne the wayes of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> because God inlargeth his way; and giveth him free scope, and more opportunities, and advantages for it: and to improve those favours for the advancement of his glory that gave them.</p>
                  <p>But the particular thing that is especially exprest here (though <note place="margin">In times of judgement.</note> that be intimated too, and it is noted as a character here of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked spirit, <hi>that they will doe wickedly in the land of uprightnesse:</hi> that is, in the land where God dealeth very gently, and graciously, and uprightly with them every way, and squarely, that they can no waycomplaine: it is a wicked spirit that doth so.) But that which is specially meant here <hi>(in the way of thy judgements will we waite for thee)</hi> is, that Gods servants, will not only, not start (if their temper be right) from God when he smiles upon them; but they will love him when he frowneth, they will even then stoope and kisse the rodde, they will then obey him: Gods children will acknowledge him to be their Father and Lord, and submit to him, even when he is angrie.</p>
                  <p>Here is a vast difference betweene the godly and the wicked (as I shall a little touch by and by.) As the Father speakes even to <note place="margin">Simile.</note> this very purpose: when sweet oyntment is chafed, it smells the more sweet, it delivereth the perfume the more excellent; but in a dunghill, in a filthy place, stirre it, and the more you stirre, the more it stinkes. Wicked spirits, when God doth but chafe them, manifest the filth and corruption that is within them; as a man may know money (as he saith) when it falleth downe, whether it be silver or brasse, it will then betray it selfe: so here, their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>their speech will betray them then,</hi> and declare what they are. The divell thought that <hi>Iob</hi> had beene of such a temper, that hee would have curst <hi>God to his face,</hi> if hee would lay his hand upon him, and touch him: but it was farre otherwise, because he was of a better mettall and stampe, therefore he blessed God in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of judgement, as he had done formerly in the middest of his mercies. And this is that a Christian should doe: labour to bee fruitfull in thankfulnesse, and chearefulnesse of spirit, when God sheweth favour, and giveth any case, and mercy to him; and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour likewise to be faithfull and constant to him, even when his judgements are abroad.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:14764:164"/>
But there be divers particulars in that (I will but meerely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them.) There be these foure things, as so many steps and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the dutie of a Christian in the times of Judgement, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be impendant, or incombent, whether they be publike, or private, that concerne the Church, or particular persons.</p>
                  <p>First of all, the dutie of a Christian in the times of Judgement <note place="margin">1. Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> (if he be of a right temper) is Perseverance, to hold out, not to be beaten off for a little storme or shocke, but to keepe on his pace, to keepe on his way.</p>
                  <p>Travellers that goe to sea: meerely to bee sicke a little, or in <note place="margin">Simile.</note> sport, if there arise but a blacke cloud, they presently give over, their voyage is at an end; they come not to venture shockes, and stormes, and danger; they come for pleasure: but the Marchant, that is bound upon a voyage, whose trade and imployment of life it is, every cloud and wind, doeth not make him to returne backe a gaine to shoare and to give over: but he goeth them through: so it is in this case, one that is not indeed and in earnest travelling toward heaven, he will be easily off upon a little storme arising; if God doe but frowne, if there be but a wrinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle in his brow: all his pleasure in religion is gone, for it was some other things he aymed at, it was but for pleasure he came in here: but a godly Christian who is bound for heaven, whose voyage is set for heaven, and his course and the bent of his soule lieth that way, that. like a ship with full faile is carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heaven: stormes will not beat him off, but hee will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a necessary use (as there should be perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <note place="margin">2. Diligent exercise of our graces.</note> so) that there should be a kind of excellencie and precellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of all holy duties (which I mentioned in the generall before) which a man should exercise so much the more industriously and painfully in stormes and difficulties. All sweet odours are refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the head at any time, but when there is a stinking place that <note place="margin">Simile.</note> is offensive, men hold them closer to them: so it should be with all the graces of Gods Spirit, with all holy duties, they should bee precious to us at all times; but specially in times of stresse and difficultie: Oh then we should cleave close to them, then multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie in prayers, then multiply in our holy walking with God, then multiply examining diligently our wayes, and looking more strictly and narrowly to our selves; then we should reflect more seriously upon our lives, and then we should excell our selves: or else it will not countervaile, and be an Antidote against the evill and bitternesse of the times.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there should be shewed patience in the time of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">3. Patience.</note> in the time of Gods Judgement: we should not mutter against God, nor struggle, nor be violent against him: but humbly and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:14764:165"/>
meekly lay our selves downe before him, <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe what seemeth him good in his eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And lastly, there should be a proficiencie: the the <hi>inhabitants of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. Proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> 
                     <hi>the earth will learne righteousnesse:</hi> we should patiently waite upon God in the way of his Judgements, and withall we should be good proficients, then to learne righteousnesse. Gods rod should be to us as the fescue is to the child, the fescue points out to the child the letter, makes him take notice of it: and so Gods rod points out many good lessons which we should never otherwise learne and take notice of. I had never knowne (as <hi>Luthers</hi> wife said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time) what such and such things meant, in such and such Psalmes, such complaints and workings of spirit, I had never understood the practise of our dutie, if God had not brought me under some affliction: affliction was a Comentarie, and fescue to point out my lesson to me; and by that I understood.</p>
                  <p>Let me but mention one thing more in a word (I shall leave <note place="margin">The Motives to the duties.</note> the Application, because I am prevented.) Here is now the summe of a Christians dutie, which I have recommended to you, out of the words of the verses read: partly generall duties that belong to all Christians in all times: and partly some particular duties which concerne them more specially in some speciall times. There is a motive or two to presse and stirre us up to the performance of these duties. There is one in the verse before those I have read (the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth verse) <hi>The way of the just is uprightnesse: thou most upright doest weigh the path of the just.</hi> Here the first Motive is from the <note place="margin">1 God seeth, and</note> consideration of God. God is a holy overseer of all our wayes; a spectatour of all our carriage and behaviour, how we doe carry our selves, and approve our selves to him. God is not only a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatour, and an overseer of our wayes, but hee is an expencer, a <note place="margin">judgeth all our wayes.</note> weigher and Judge of our wayes; to reward everyman according to his workes: and wee should often cast our eyes to God, and see him looking upon us in our carriages, to put some more awe upon our spirits, that we may not wantonly breake out against God, not daring to doe evill in the presence of that holy God which one day we know, we must bee brought to account for, at the great Judgement. But I can but name it.</p>
                  <p>There is a second Motive in the close, in those words which <note place="margin">2. This alone differenceth the godly from the wicked.</note> stand last of those I read, and a verse following. And that is from men, from the particular proper character of a Christian: it is that which differenceth a godly man from a wicked man. Herein lies the difference of their temper, and of their spirit: the godly man, he is described already what his carriage is, that is his carriage, which is here limned out in the Prophets owne expression, in their name: but the wicked men they are cleane otherwise, they doe not performe these duties; neither the generall, nor the particular.
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:14764:165"/>
Now it behoveth every one to take care to <hi>depart from the tents of those wicked men;</hi> that shall bee swallowed up, and goe downe quicke to hell every one (as it was in the case of <hi>Korah.)</hi> It is the command of God that they should depart and sever themselves, and make as broad and vast a difference, and bee jealous, and take heed lest they assimulate themselves to wicked men in their lives, lest they be like unto them in their deaths: that they live not as they doe, lest they perish as they doe.</p>
                  <p>Now, there be two or three things that are exprest concerning these wicked men.</p>
                  <p>First of all, their Character is to be refractary to God in what way soever he shewes himselfe to them: if he shew his favour, or send his Judgements it is all one: <hi>in the land of uprightnesse, they will doe wickedly, and when Gods hand is lifted up, they will not see:</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will doe them good: no way of working upon them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therby faire, nor by foule meanes. And we must be unlike them therefore every way; we must take every dealing of God by the right eare (as he said) and make the right use of it for good.</p>
                  <p>There is another thing exprest of them: that God will one day meet with these wicked men: let no man deceive himselfe: it is not a vaine thing to serve God: nor a cheape, nor a safe thing to rebell against God, for his hand shall be lifted up, and hee will breake them in peeces, and the longer he spareth, and the gentler he is, the more heavy it will come at last. Gods Mill grindeth slow, but it grindes to powder (as the ancient saying is) the more God is long-suffering, and long lifting up his hand to lay his stroake, the heavier stroake he layes upon them, and crusheth all to peeces at last.</p>
                  <p>But there is another thing too: even those wicked men that are so stubborne and refractary, and scorne Gods word: that lift up the heele and kicke against him, and it may be scoffe and jeare, and deride the wayes of God: time shall come that even these wicked men shall be convinced, they shall see their envie against the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and hatred against the wayes of God, they shall see their foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie, and they shall at last repent, when repentance shall doe them no good: repent, when they are even turned into hell, when they heare that sentence, <hi>Depart from mee you cursed.</hi> Therefore now seeing these things will befall the rebellious, that doe not walke according to this rule, according to this Canon which I have characterised a godly man by: this should bee a good incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to godly men so much the more to walke constantly, and to be true to their owne way. And if they doe live amongst wicked men, to be rather gainers by them, to grow the better rather then to receive infection, and corruption from them.</p>
                  <p>They say that Lillies and Roses, or such like things, if they be
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:14764:166"/>
planted by Garlicke or Onions, or such like unfavourie things, they doe increase in sweetnesse: the Rose and the Lillie are swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: so it should be when godly men are planted, and hemmed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with wicked men: the vilenesse and odiousnesse of their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wayes, may make them to loath wickednesse the more, and to love godlinesse, and to blesse God, that hath kept them, that they have not run to the same excesse of ryot with them.</p>
                  <p>In stead of all other Application which I thought to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; as for example, and for instance: to shew us the true Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of a Christian: that we may discerne, who is a right Christian, and who is not: we must not discerne it by our fancies, but by those Characters God hath set.</p>
                  <p>And a just apologie (in the second place) for those that are branded with nick-names. If this be the description of true pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and of a true Christian, to have the heart and soule breathing after God, and seeking night and day after him, and setting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wholly to walke in the way of uprightnesse, with sincerity before God: then certainly they are unjustly branded, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences doe aime at these things, and the consciences of other men may tell them, that they doe so, and they see no other.</p>
                  <p>And so for conviction of those men that are in the Bosome of the Church: they may see, if they be not according to this stampe: if they either faile of it, that there is none of these liniaments to be found in them, nothing toward God and his name, no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, no affection, no endeavours working that way (and so for the rest) if they utterly faile of this, they utterly come short, and are not worthy the name of Christians: but much more if they doe deride, and oppose, and contemne the mind, and the wayes of God, which God hath chalked out to us, for our rule and direction: that is a high degree of fayling and comming short, and therefore they may be convinced, that they cannot bee right: I doubt when the Bookes shall bee opened, and every one judged according to the booke of God, which shall be layed for the tryall of our lives: if our lives be not according to that: whatsoever our words bee, and howsoever wee carry it, it will not beare us out then.</p>
                  <p>And it might have beene a Use also of Examination; let every one of us examine our selves, and what our estate is according to this rule, and what degree of this we have attained too.</p>
                  <p>And then for comfort, for those that are such according to this rule, whether it be in the perfection, or in the affection. If they have not the perfection, yet if their affections stand and runne this way, and that they can truly, and ingeniously say, that they are such in sincerity, there is a great deale of comfort for them.</p>
                  <p>And for Exhortation, out of the severall branches of the duty
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:14764:166"/>
which I cannot meddle with. And out of the severall Motives that I propounded out of the words of the Text.</p>
                  <p>But (I say) in stead of all these, this present Sister of ours, whose Funerall we now solemnize, I might fetch an Argument as a Motive to all these severall duties from her example.</p>
                  <p>To returne now therefore to the present occasion.</p>
                  <p>I will speake something concerning Her in honour of whose Funerall solemnities, we are at this time met together (that gave us the occasion) I shall (according to my custome) dispatch it briefly.</p>
                  <p>When any children of God die, the last offices of Love are performed to them by three severall sorts or rankes. The Angels: they convey their soules into the <hi>bosome of their father Abraham,</hi> into the blisse of eternity. The Bearers, attended with the Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: they carry their bodies to the bosome of their mother earth, to rest in tranquility. The Preachers (as it were a middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and them) they commend their name to the mindes of their friends the hearers, to live in their memories. My part at the present is to doe this: and I shall doe it, not so much to trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet out her commendation, as to take a hint of something for your instruction, which may be usefull.</p>
                  <p>But I must intreat you to remember, that you doe not use to lace or adorne your mournings: and therefore you have little reason to expect, any eloquent adorning, any Festivall ornament in such a Funerall argument. My language must be blacke, and patheticall, sutable to our sad occasion: it must not be pleasing to the fancie in the fresh flowers of Rhetoricke; my language (I say) must be in blacke, but in blacke layed upon a ground of truth, which shall not blush for blame, speaking any thing besides, what I doe really conceive. As I dare not doe you so much wrong, as to paint or guild a rotten post: so I am willing to doe her so much right, as to set a rich Pearle in gold.</p>
                  <p>To passe other circumstances (as that shee was descended of an honest, and worthy Familie, and of good qualitie: that Shee had a full and hopefull issue descending from her selfe, and such like circumstances, which I leave for Oratours (as unfit for a Divine) to meddle withall.) All that I shall say concerning Her, shall bee out of the Text, in which you may behold a true picture of her in all the linaments of her: and out of it, you may be able to draw, and take a good patterne for your selves.</p>
                  <p>The Byas of her spirit was <hi>toward God, and toward his Name;</hi> whose lively Image shee bare, graven in her memorie, living in her desires, and (beyond all pictures) moving also in her endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to seeke after God. The very quintescence of her spirit was carryed this way, and that <hi>intimatly, sincerely, universally, and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:14764:167"/>
constantly. With her soule shee desired him in the night, and with her spirit shee sought him in the morning:</hi> the light of the morning, and the evening starre (as sometime the Starre did the Wise men) conducted her to the <hi>Sunne of righteousnesse.</hi> In mercies Shee was not wanton, but thankfull and fruitfull: In judgements (as in a fatherly way of correction, Shee had a deepe share, wherein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exercised with many yeares weaknesse, as those that knew her, knew very well, but yet in such fatherly dealings) shee shewed her <hi>patience,</hi> her <hi>perseverance,</hi> her <hi>proficiencie:</hi> and being a Mourner for the stubbornnesse of the wicked, shee was a gainer likewise by them too: and all because shee looked up to God, who sees and weighs all our paths. In which I have briefly recollected upon the matter, the summe of the whole things conteyned in the text: so that so long as this Text is in the Bible, and so long as the Bible is in the Church, and so long as any thing (though unworthy) of this Sermon remaines in your memories, shee cannot want eithera sweet memoriall of her vertues in the booke of God, or a stately Monument in the Church, and in your hearts too.</p>
                  <p>Happily some may scoffe, and some may doubt, as though this commendation flew too high, or out of sight. To whom I shall briefly answer both. For the former. It is reported of two great Tragedians, learned and famous in their time: <hi>Sophocles,</hi> and <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides. Euripides</hi> presented upon the Scaene all naughty women: and <hi>Sophocles</hi> presented all vertuous women: and the ordinary obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the wits of the times was (as men are apt to bee vainly witted in these things) they thought that <hi>Euripides</hi> that presented them bad, presented women as they were: and <hi>Sophocles</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented them good, presented them as they should bee. If I had nothing else to say to the scoffes of any, but only this, I suppose it would be sufficient: I doe beleeve fully, that I have presented her as she was: but howsoever you can take no hurt if you doe but consider, that it is spoken as what you should be. I am sure, and I know I have presented what you should be.</p>
                  <p>And for any that shall doubt yet, that it may seeme too high. I would desire them only to consider this: I describe in the Text, the very temper and character of one that is truly godly (such as I conceive her to have beene) and the truth is, there is none that is truly godly, but in some degree or measure must at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and doe attaine to participate in a conformitie with this Character: and therefore I have neither done you (as I conceive) any wrong, and yet done her right too. And (to draw to an end) She hath left this honour behind her, that she lived beloved, and died desired.</p>
                  <p>And who is there here almost that suffereth not a losse in her? Her Husband hath lost a loving wife that honoured him highly.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:14764:167"/>
Her children have lost a loving Mother, that loved them tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that tendered them duly. Her servants have lost a loving Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris, that governed them gently, and was every way beneficiall to them. Her Brothers and Sisters, have lost a loving Sister, that answered them in their loves sweetly. Her Neighbours have lost a loving neigbour: full of courtesie to the rich, full of charitie to the poore. And my selfe have lost (I hope there is none here so weake to suspect, that I blast the living, to blazon the praise of the dead, or that I doe robbe or strippe the living, to cloath the dead with their spoyles, but I thinke I may truly say, I have lost) as truly and cordially a loving friend, as any shee hath left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behind: though I esteeme many her Peeres, and I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of any.</p>
                  <p>But to end all. Her gaine in Christ countervaileth and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all our losses. Shee was a disciple of Love, shee loved her Lord, and loved all his Saints and servants: and therefore I doubt not, that she was a beloved disciple, and resteth in the bosome of her Love: where not to disquiet her happinesse, and detaine your patience any longer, I shall leave her in that blessed place, and commend you to the blessing of God.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the seventh verse of this Chapter, the <note place="margin">Coherence.</note> blessed Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth the Philippians, <hi>to bee followers together of him, and to marke them which walke so as they had him for an ensample:</hi> And that hee might the better direct them in the dutie, (the imitation of his ensample) he sheweth that there is a great difference betweene others that pretended themselves to be the Apostles of Christ, and indeed were not, and himselfe: <hi>Many</hi> (saith he) <hi>walke, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you weeping, that they are the enemies of the crosse of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly: and whose glory is their shame, who mind earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things.</hi> These ensamples he would have them to avoide: fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not such, but <hi>be yee followers of us, for our conversation is in

heaven, from whence we looke for the Saviour, the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and follow those which walke, so as yee have us for an ensample:</hi> This is the example he would have them imitate.</p>
                  <p>In the words you have these things considerable. <note place="margin">Division of the words.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, What the <hi>conversation</hi> of these men was, whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle would have the Philipians to follow. Their <hi>conversation</hi> was <note place="margin">1</note> a heavenly <hi>conversation: Our conversation is in heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the reason or incouragement that they had to this <note place="margin">2</note> imitation, to walke so heavenly, while they were on earth: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>from thence we looke for a Saviour, the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the benefit by that <hi>Saviour, whom they looke for from</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3</note> 
                     <hi>heaven: Hee shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the meanes by which this great worke shall bee effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; <note place="margin">4</note> 
                     <hi>According to the working whereby hee is able to subdue all things unto himselfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the first (to touch it only in a word) there is from that, these two Observations clearely arising.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That there is a heavenly conversation of the Saints on earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That while they are on earth, they are now stated in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Our conversation is in heaven:</hi> Hee saith not only it shall bee <hi>in heaven,</hi> (though there it shall be perfected) but <hi>it is now in heaven,</hi> in regard of our present state and possession.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the first, that <hi>the Saints on earth have a heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obser.</hi> 1. The Saints on earth have a heavenly conversation.</note> You must know, that the word here <hi>Politeuma,</hi> transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>conversation,</hi> signifieth such a course of life, and of traffique, as is in Cities and Corporations, where many are knit, and united together in one common societie, in one common freedome: <hi>Our conversation is in heaven;</hi> that is, we have a kind of heavenly traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, <note place="margin">What it is.</note> a heavenly trade, while we are upon earth.</p>
                  <p>There are divers things wherein there is an agreement between the cariages and conditions of men in Cities, and Societies here on earth, and this of the Saints of God, that have <hi>their conversations in heaven.</hi> I will only in briefe run them over, this being not the thing that I purposely ayme at. <note place="margin">The priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges thereof.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, in Cities and Corporations there is a Register, wherein the names of the Freemen are inrolled. So in heaven also there is <note place="margin">1. Their names are written in heaven.</note> a Register, a certaine booke of Records (as it were) wherein are written the names of as many, as God hath appointed to life: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce not</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>in this, that the divels are subdued unto you, but rejoyce, that your names are written in heaven:</hi> And <hi>all that are</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>not found written in the booke of life, are cast into the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone,</hi> Rev. 20. 15. God in his secret counsell and purpose, in his speciall providence and love, takes notice of all his servants, even of their names, and he hath them as sure, as if they
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:14764:170"/>
were written downe in a booke, there is not one man that commeth to heaven, but the Lord knowes him already to be a man ordained to that estate and condition.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as in all Cities and Societies, there is a certaine law <note place="margin">2. They are governed by the law of God.</note> whereby they are all governed, in obedience to which they live. So there is a law whereby all the Citizens of heaven all the <hi>hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of God</hi> are governed, that law which the Apostle Saint <hi>Iames</hi> calleth <hi>the royall law:</hi> a law which commandeth the very spirits of men: a law that disposeth the whole man to a heavenly frame, and subjection to the will of God, the great King of Heaven; so that a man while he is here below, by degrees is drawne off from the world in his affections and disposition and carriage: and made su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and conformable to the rule of righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as in all Cities, there is a kind of safety and securitie to <note place="margin">3. They are safely kept.</note> those that dwell there, not onely as they are incompassed with walls, but also as there is watching and warding, some wakin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> while others sleepe to keepe the rest in safety. So in this heavenly societie: <hi>the Angels pitch their Tents about those that feare God:</hi> nay <hi>the Lord</hi> himselfe <hi>is the Shepheard of Israel that neither slumbereth nor sleepeth:</hi> while men oppose them, God defends them: while men are labouring and plotting, and devising against them, and they (it may be) are secure and feare no danger; God disperseth and disappointeth a thousand projects intended against his servants. It was so with his owne people Israel: while they were in the plaines, securely lying in their tents: there is <hi>Balack</hi> and <hi>Balaam</hi> consulting upon the mountaines how to curse them: but the God of Israel that is above the mountaines, that sitteth on the highest Heavens, hee ordereth the matter so, that <hi>Balaam</hi> for his life, (though hee might have had all the wealth and honour of the Kingdome) could not pronounce one curse against Israel, because God had said to him that he should not curse.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. As in Cities and societies on earth, men have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion <note place="margin">4. They have interest.</note> and societie one with another, the lesse have interest in the greater, and the greater in the lesse, and all have interest one in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: the inferiours receive from the superiours, protection and provision, and the superiours receive from the inferiours, subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and submission. So it is in this heavenly Corporation, in this spirituall Hierusalem: <hi>Ierusalem is a Citie at unitie in it selfe;</hi> There is a communion and fellowship, that the Saints have with God the Father, with Christ, with the Angels, with the Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and one with another on earth.</p>
                  <p>With God the Father: they have an interest in him, as subjects <note place="margin">In God.</note> of his kingdome, as servants and children of his family: there is not the meanest subject in this kingdome, but he may make his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest knowne to this Prince: there is not the least servant in this
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:14764:171"/>
Family, but he may make his complaint to this Master: they may (as children) <hi>goe boldly to the throne of grace, and make their request knowne unto him, though it be but in sighes and groanes.</hi> Hence it is that God takes notice of them, <hi>your heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of all these things;</hi> and therefore hee will supply them: <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>If you that are earthly can give good things to your children, how much</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Chap. 7. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>more shall your heavenly Father give good things to them that aske him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They have interest in Christ also: he is their <hi>Intercessour,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">In Christ.</note> hence it is, that he is said <hi>to sit at the right hand of God, making intercession for us:</hi> Hee is their <hi>Advocate, if any man sinne, wee have an Advocate with the Father, even Iesus Christ the righteous:</hi> Hee is their Lord and Captaine, <hi>the Captaine of the Lords Armie,</hi> to defend his Church; <hi>Michael, the great Prince standeth up for the children of his people.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>They have interest also in the Holy Ghost the third Person in <note place="margin">In the holy Ghost.</note> Trinitie, they have not only, <hi>the love of God the Father, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowship of the Holy Ghost,</hi> as the Apostle wisheth for the Corinthians. Hence it is that the <hi>Holy Ghost is ready to helpe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>their infirmities; to inable them to put up their requests, when they know not how to pray as they ought.</hi> Hence it is that hee sanctifieth them, and therefore they are said to bee <hi>Borne againe of water, and of the spirit:</hi> that hee comforteth them, therefore hee is called <hi>the holy Ghost the Comforter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the Saints have interest in the three Persons in the Trinitie, in respect of their dependance upon them, so the blessed Trinitie hath an interest in them also: <hi>If I bee a Father, where is my honour? if I bee a Master, where is my feare?</hi> Because they acknowledge God to be their Father, they honour him, because they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to betheir Lord they feare him, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>They have interest in the Angels also: Hence it is that they are <note place="margin">In the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</note> called <hi>Ministring spirits sent forth for the good of the Elect:</hi> They were Christs messengers, his Angels, and now they are made Messengers, Angels; to the Saints, therefore saith Christ, <hi>Offend not one of these little ones, for I tell you, that their Angels behold the face of my father in heaven.</hi> They have interest in them, not as <hi>worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Angels,</hi> which the Apostle condemneth, <hi>Coll.</hi> 2. as foresee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what a height Popish superstition would rise in this kind: I say; not to worship them, to invocate them, to pray to them, we know no such will-worship which is without the rule. Wee have an Angell comforting <hi>Hagar;</hi> we have an Angell defending <hi>Elisha;</hi> we have an Angel incouraging <hi>Iacob;</hi> wee have an Angell carrying <hi>Lazarus</hi> into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome: But wee never had any Angell that stood in this place, to have worship and adoration. This indeed the Angels have from us, imitation of their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, we pray, <hi>thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:14764:171"/>

No such matter; What then? To doe that which a man accounteth as harsh a peece of worke, as to plucke out his eye, or cut off his hand; that is, to mortifie his carnall affections, to part with his sweetest lusts, which a man holdeth as deare, and sets as high a rate upon, as on his right hand, or his right eye; there should be no sinne so precious, no gaine so sweet, no pleasure so delightfull, but a man should be willing to let
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:14764:172"/>
it for Christ: there should be no worldly thing whatsoever, that a man should so set his heart upon, but if persecution for the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell should come, he should be contented to leave it for Christ, and in the meane space to let his affections hang loose to it, that whensoever Christ shall call him to part with his estate, with his contentments, with himselfe, he may let all fall for his sake, and the Gospels. This is the heavenly traffique of a Christian.</p>
                  <p>I might here lay downe some tryals, by which men may bee <note place="margin">How to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation be in heaven.</note> able to judge of themselves in this particular, whether their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation bee in heaven.</hi> I will instance but in some generalls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I hasten to that I principally intend.</p>
                  <p>See how thy affectionstand; such as is a mans mind, such is the man: such as is a mans affection, such is his conversation: a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly affection argueth <hi>a heavenly conversation: a heavenly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">By our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> presupposeth a heavenly affection: for it is impossible for any man to walke in a heavenly course, but he that is of a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind.</p>
                  <p>It sheweth the errour of those men that thinke, that that pitch of holinesse, and carefull walking with God in newnesse of life, is too strict a point to bee pressed: what (say they) will you have us to be Saints? are wee not men? shall wee not have infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties still?</p>
                  <p>Yes that thou wilt, when thou hast done what thou canst. But here is the thing: What is the bent of thy heart? what is the strength of thy mind? what is the endeavour of thy wholeman? <note place="margin">Note.</note> which way are thy affections carried? What dost thou mourne for most? what dost thou rejoyce in most? what dost thou hope for most? According to thy affections, so will thy labour and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourbe. A heavenly heart sorroweth most for sinne, a heavenly affection rejoyceth most in Christ: <hi>Many say, who will shew us any good, but Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us: thou hast given me more joy of heart then they had, when their corne, and wine, and oyle abounded.</hi> A heavenly affection hopeth most for heaven, and that not so much, that thereby hee may be released from worldly troubles, as that he may be possessed of those heavenly joyes, that are to be had in the presence of God, and in a perfect communion with him; that he may be freed from sinne, and fully brought into the <hi>glorious liberty of the sonnes of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is that which stirreth him up with all industry and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, and carrieth him along mainly, and chiefly to seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not the wealth, and honour, and pleasure of the world, but how he may get into the Covenant of grace, and an interest in Christ, how he may attaine evidences of heaven, and testimonies of the love of God. He speakes of heaven, as the worldly man speakes of the world. A worldly man <hi>speakes of the world, and the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:14764:172"/>
world heareth him</hi> (saith Christ) every table ringeth of his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly talke; every company soundeth of his worldly affections; in every meeting he sheweth his worldly disposition. So a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-minded man is alwayes talking of heavenly things: alwayes labouring to draw heavenly uses out of earthly things: let crosses come, he can draw comforts from thence, he makes them meanes to take off his heart from the world, to set it more toward heaven: as <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, the more the waters increased, the neerer it was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to heaven: so a heavenly man, the more worldly crosses come, the higher his soule riseth toward heaven: the worldly man sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth under afflictions, but he is lifted up neerer to Christ. This is <hi>a heavenly conversation.</hi> But I will not stand on this.</p>
                  <p>The second thing which I told you was observable from the first <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obser.</hi> 2. While the Saints are on earth they are stated in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> part of the Text, was this; <hi>That in this very life, the children of God are stated in a heavenly condition. Our conversation is now in heaven,</hi> saith the Apostle.</p>
                  <p>When a man is brought by repentance and faith unto Christ, he is brought into a heavenly state: actually possessed of heaven. And that in two respects;</p>
                  <p>In respect of right and title.</p>
                  <p>In respect of possession.</p>
                  <p>First in respect of right and title, and that also first in respect of <note place="margin">1. In respect of right and title.</note> Election: God hath elected them to it. Secondly in respect of vocation: <hi>they are begotten againe to a lively hope.</hi> They have now the Word which giveth them a promise of heaven. They have now the spirit, which is <hi>the seale of their inheritance, you are sealed by the spirit of Promise, to the day of redemption,</hi> Eph. 1. 13.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of possession: they are now already in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <note place="margin">2. In respect of present possession.</note> possession, not in full possession, but in present possession: A possession not in themselves, but in Christ, by vertue of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and communion they have in him. By the union and contract that is betweene Christ and the soule; Christ is become the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the Christian the Spouse. So that as a Wife if her Husband should travell into a farre Countrey, and in her name should take possession of those lands, that were left her by her Father, the Wife now is possest of those lands, in her Husband, who in her name hath taken possession of them: so Christ entring into heaven, hath tooke possession of heaven, which is given to us by the will of God; <hi>It is your Fathers pleasure to give you a kingdome:</hi> Christ hath possessed it in our name: <hi>I goe</hi> (saith he) <hi>to prepare a place for you: and it is my will that they bee where I am: I goe to my Father, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">John 14.</note> 
                     <hi>your Father; to my God, and your God.</hi> All that Christ hath in heaven, Hee hath it for us: Hee is gone before, that wee may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:14764:173"/>
after: wee cannot possibly lay claime to heaven, wee cannot hope hereafter fully, and personally to professe it, if Christ had not first taken possession of heaven for us.</p>
                  <p>The Use of this in a word, shall bee to stirre up every one to <note place="margin">Vse.</note> looketo his hope of heaven. It is usuall for men to possesse their hope to be saved, and scarse any, but they will say they hope, if they die, they shall goe to heaven. Yea, but thou must now pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse it, if ever hereafter thou meane to enjoy it: and thou must possesse it first in Christ: thou must be united to him by faith and love: those are the bonds whereby the Spirit of God, tyeth us unto Christ: therefore Christ is said to <hi>dwell in our hearts by faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which shewes the horrible presumption of many, and how <note place="margin">Presumption to hope for heaven, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out union with Christ first on earth.</note> they adde to their other sinnes this, that they presume that they have right, and title to heaven, and yet are not united to Christ by faith: as if a man should give out, that he were the heire apparant to a Crowne, or the sonne of a King, and yet neverthelesse should indeed be the sonne of a Beggar, and have nothing to shew for his pretended title to the Crowne and kingdome: what would this be accounted, but high treason against the King? What a height of sinne is this that is in many men, which to their other sinnes adde a presumptuous claime to heaven, when they have no right to it?</p>
                  <p>I Remember, that in the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> we shall read of many, <note place="margin">Ezra 2. 62.</note> that laid title and claime to the Priesthood: but <hi>Ezra</hi> searched the booke of the Genealogies, and finding none of their names Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred there, he presently concluded that they were none of the Priesthood, therefore <hi>they were accounted polluted,</hi> and put from the Priesthood. If any man lay claime to heaven; God will search his booke of Genealogies (as it were) he will search the Register of heaven, and if he find that his name be not inrolled there, if hee be not found to have interestin Jesus Christ, all will be nothing, he shall bee cast out to his greater confusion. This should therefore stirre up euery one to make good his claime to heaven now: either now to bee possest of heaven, now to <hi>sit in heavenly places with Christ,</hi> or else looke not to come to heaven afterward.</p>
                  <p>But to leave this, and to come to that I mainly intend, namely the Argument, or reason or ground of the Apostles heavenly conversation. <hi>Our conversation is in heaven, from whence wee looke for the Saviour, the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apostle observeth here a kind of speech, and that which seemes not so Grammaticall: that he may thereupon build a sound and substantiall truth in Divinitie. He had said before, <hi>Our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation is in the heavens,</hi> in the Plurall number: but now when hee speakes of Christs comming thence, he speakes of it in the Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar number, <hi>Our conversation is in the heavens,</hi> from whence, from
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:14764:173"/>
which particular place, <hi>Wee looke for the Saviour, the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Of purpose to shew us thus much: that though Christ in respect of his Deitie, and divine nature he be in all places, <hi>filling</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Christ in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is onely in heaven.</note> 
                     <hi>heaven and earth:</hi> yet in respect of his bodily presence, hee remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth now, and so will till his second comming (which the Saints looke for) in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Against those <hi>Vbiquitaries,</hi> that will have the body of Christ to be every where: In Heaven (say they) visible; in this place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible. The Papists hence build the Doctrine of Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: they will have the body of Christ, even that very body <note place="margin">Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarion.</note> that was borne of the Virgin, to be now Bread, and the bread tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into it. The Lutherans will have the same Body about the bread. No, saith the Apostle, there is no such matter: from thence, from that very place, that very individuall, particular, single place, from the third heavens, where the body of Christ is, <hi>Wee looke for the Saviour:</hi> hee remaineth there, and so will continue till his comming to Judgement. So againe in another place, <hi>Collos.</hi> 3. 1. <note place="margin">Collos 3. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Set your affections on things above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God; Above,</hi> that is in heaven, <hi>where Christ sitteth,</hi> and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and will remaine till his second comming. Our Saviour told his Disciples in the dayes of his flesh, <hi>that the poore they should have alwayes with them, but me</hi> (saith he) <hi>you shall not have alwayes.</hi> If this be true that they say; then Christ hath not said true, for hee is still in respect of his bodily presence, and hath beene, alwayes, with us. But I let passe that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The thing I note hence is this; That</hi> that which most soundly, and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obser.</hi> 3. Expectation of Christs comming to Judgement, the best meanes to worke a man to a holy conversation.</note> effectually settleth the heart of a man, in a heavenly conversation upon earth, is the looking for the Saviour of the world, even the Lord Iesus Christ to come from thence.</p>
                  <p>I say, there is nothing that so settleth the heart of a man in a heavenly conversation upon earth, nothing that makes him so heavenly minded, nothing that ordereth him in so heavenly a course, as this, if hee rightly looke for Christ to come from thence.</p>
                  <p>That you may conceive this the better, you may please to take notice, that there are two things included in this point.</p>
                  <p>First, that all the Saints of God, while they are on earth, their continuall expectation is, for Christ to come from heaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that nothing is so effectuall to settle a man in a holy course while he liveth on earth, as this expectation.</p>
                  <p>These two things I will open to you at this time. <note place="margin">The continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Saints is for Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first (I say) is, that the Saints and servants of God while they are on earth, doe continually expect and looke for <hi>the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:14764:174"/>
of the world, even the Lord Iesus Christ</hi> to come from heaven.</p>
                  <p>By the comming of Christ, you must understand his second comming to judgement. For there is a threefold comming of <note place="margin">A threefold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> comming of Christ.</note> Christ. A twofold comming in his Bodie; and one by his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>The first, was the comming of Christ in the flesh, when hee came to take our nature upon him, and to be borne of a Virgin.</p>
                  <p>The second, is the comming of Christ by his Spirit, so hee commeth continually, and dayly in the hearts of men, in the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell in vertue and efficacie.</p>
                  <p>His last comming, and his second comming in respect of his body, is when hee shall come to judgement. Never looke for the comming of Christ in his body upon earth in the sight of men, till that great day come, when the <hi>Lord Iesus shall come with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of his Angels, in the glory of his Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now then this being the meaning of it: we will prove it. And first, that it is the continuall expectation of all the Saints of God, and the continuall desire of their hearts, their continuall waiting, is for the second comming of the Lord Christ.</p>
                  <p>As it was before the first comming of Christ in the flesh, so it <note place="margin">Proved.</note> shall be before his second comming. Before the first comming of Christ, after the promise was made to <hi>Adam,</hi> all the expectation and hope of the Fathers, and Beleevers, was this, when the great Messias would come: and therefore saith <hi>Iacob, I have waited for thy salvation;</hi> and <hi>David, I have longed for thy salvation,</hi> meaning Christ, the Saviour of the world: and the Church groweth to a kind of holy impatiencie; <hi>Oh that thou wouldest breake the heavens and come downe.</hi> And immediatly upon the time of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, there were alwayes holy men in those times, that were stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up with a continuall expectation of it; and therefore it was made a marke of a good man in those dayes: It is said of <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi> and of divers good women, as of <hi>Anna</hi> and others, <hi>that they waited for the consolation of Israel;</hi> they continually waited and expected, when the great comforter, and Saviour of his people would come. So shall the second comming of Christ be: from the very time of his Ascension into heaven, to the time now, and to the time of his last comming to Judgement, all the eyes of men will be towards him: <hi>When I am lifted up</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>I will draw all men after me,</hi> which though it bee there particularly understood of his lifting up upon the Crosse, yet it is intended in generall of his Ascension into heaven. So that as after the promise was given of the Spirit; <hi>The Disciples waited for the receiving of the gift of the holy Ghost.</hi> So it is now, and will bee, since the holy Ghost is already given, there remaineth nothing to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:14764:174"/>
be looked for, but Christ himselfe in his second comming to finish all these dayes of sinne.</p>
                  <p>And that this is the disposition of all the servants of God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by divers places of Scripture, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. saith the Apostle <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 8.</note> there; <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for mee a crowne of righteousnesse, which the Lord, the righteous Iudge, shall give me at that day: and not to mee only, but unto them also that love his appearing.</hi> The Apostle here makes a description of all those that shall bee saved, and hee saith, they are such as <hi>love the appearing of Iesus Christ;</hi> now that which a man loveth, he desireth, and lookes, and longs for. And in <hi>Heb. 9. 28. Christ died once for many, and unto them that looke for</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>him, shall hee appeare the second time unto salvation.</hi> Salvation is brought: to whom? to all those; and onely to those that <hi>looke for the appearance of Christ.</hi> Therefore it is said of all the Beleevers in <hi>Heb. 11. That they saw things that were invisible, and that they had an eye to the recompence of reward, and that they saw the promise a farre off.</hi> They looked still for those things that were to appeare by Christ.</p>
                  <p>This I suppose is sufficiently confirmed by the Scripture, let us therefore make some use of it.</p>
                  <p>Try now what comfort thou hast in the expectation of that <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> For tryall.</note> great appearance of the Lord Jesus here spoken of. This is the most infallible ground, and undoubted evidence, and testimony of the truth of grace now, and assurance of glory hereafter: if God have now stirred up thy heart in faith, and holy affection, to looke for, and to long and waite for the appearance of Jesus Christ. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this there is little love to Christ. The Church in <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 2. sheweth her love to Christ, <hi>Draw mee</hi> (saith shee) <hi>and we will runne after thee.</hi> And chapt. 2. 4. <hi>Stay me with flaggons, comfort me with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, for I am sicke of love:</hi> and chap. 5. <hi>If you find him whom my soule loveth, tell him I am sicke of love.</hi> If thou be of the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, thou wilt, out of love to Christ, desire nothing so much, as to enjoy the presence of Christ: <hi>The Spirit and the Bride, say come, and let him that heareth say come: the Spirit saith come, and the Bride</hi> (because she is stirred up in the same affection by the Spirit) <hi>shee saith come</hi> too. Christ saith to his Church <hi>I come,</hi> and the Church shee saith againe <hi>Come:</hi> Here is the agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Christ and his Church, and the same disposition is in all the members of Christ, a waiting and longing, and desiring for the comming of Christ.</p>
                  <p>There are many that pretend they waite, and desire for the comming of Christ. When a man is under any affliction, or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trouble, then, <hi>Oh that Christ would come and end these troubles.</hi> You shall heare a man that is abused, and wronged by the oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and injuries of others, and by the unrighteous dealings of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ungodly men, crying out, <hi>Oh that Christ would come and put
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:14764:175"/>
an end to these evill times.</hi> Yea, but if thou hast this desire of Christs <note place="margin">How to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming bee right, 1. By the ground of it. Heb. 11. 1.</note> comming, that is in a man of a heavenly conversation. It will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in these three things.</p>
                  <p>First, it will appeare by the Ground of it. What are the grounds of thy desire? what are the motives that incourage thee, to long for the comming of the Lord Jesus? That which is the ground of faith, is the ground of hope: that is the promises: <hi>Faith is the ground of things hoped for:</hi> and the Word and promise are the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Faith: Faith and Hope looke both on this, the free promise of God: so it is said of <hi>Abraham, that hee beleeved above hope, because he knew that he that promised, was able to doe it.</hi> There is the first thing then: Faith is the ground: there is none but a true beleever, that can indeed aright waite for, and desire the comming of Christ.</p>
                  <p>But this will appeare more in the second thing, and that is, by <note place="margin">2. By the companions of it, Which are 1. Patience.</note> the companions of this expectation of Christs comming, when it is right, and as it should be in the soule of a Beleever.</p>
                  <p>The first companion of it, is <hi>Patience: If we hope for that wee see not, then doe we with patience waite for it</hi> (saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 25.) If we have hope, and expectation of Christs comming, if it be right, it will stay the heart, and calme and quiet the spirit, in the middest of all injuries and crosses, and afflictions in the world; it will make us to waite with patience: <hi>Hee that beleeveth will not make hast.</hi> When a man beleeveth that there is a time when Christ will put an end to all these things, it is that which mortifieth and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueth the rising of his spirit, and discontentednesse in afflictions, it makes him <hi>possesse his soule in Patience.</hi> There is a kind of impatient waiting of men, in the middest of discontent and revilings, and evill speakings, and threatnings of others: and then, <hi>Oh that Christ would come.</hi> But when Faith workes kindly in the soule of a man: there is a calme composednesse of heart: a submission to God in the present tryall: and yet neverthelesse a rejoycing, in hope of the comming of Christ, and of that <hi>glory that shall bee revealed.</hi> That is the first thing, there is Patience accompanying it.</p>
                  <p>The second thing that accompanieth it, is <hi>Love.</hi> No man can in truth and aright, hope for, and waite for the comming of Christ, <note place="margin">2. Love.</note> but he that loveth Christ and his comming.</p>
                  <p>Now this Love must be grounded on our tast of Gods love: <hi>Not that wee loved him, but that he loved us first</hi> (saith the Apostle) no man loveth Christ, but first he is loved of Christ: no man lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth God, but first he is loved of God: and the tast and rellish of Gods love in my soule, workes love to God againe: as from the heate that commeth from the Sunne, there is a reflection that boundeth backe againe to the Sunne: so Gods love in us reflects love to God againe. <note place="margin">Manifested in secret longings.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Love will appeare in the secret sighings of the heart:
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:14764:175"/>
                     <hi>All the creatures groane; yea, we also sigh in our selves</hi> (saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle) <hi>waiting for the adoption, even the redemption of our bodies.</hi> There is, I say, a secret sighing of heart, and that not only in the time of trouble and affliction: but in the time of comfort and prosperitie, when a man hath abundance of outward things about him, yet then, because his love is set upon Christ, and the perfection and end of love, is the fruition of the object loved, therefore there is a sighing, a holy discontent, as it were, a kind of yearning of the heart toward Christ: <hi>When shall I come and appeare before God?</hi> (saith <hi>David) how long Lord, how long?</hi> (saith the Church in the Revelation) If a man love Christ, and his comming only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it shall end those miseries, and those troubles that are upon him in this life: this is not so much love of Christ, as love of a mans selfe, of his owne ease, and peace, and rest. But the love of Christ is this, when for the injoying of himselfe, I long for the fruitton of <hi>him whom my soule loveth,</hi> and I account nothing amiable in comparison of Christ, nothing delectable, nothing comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nothing sweet to Christ: this is it that putteth the soule out of tast, and rellish with any thing, makes it sigh, as it were, under the enjoyment of all the comforts of this life, and long for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Christ, because then hee shall be perfected in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect enjoyment of Christ himselfe.</p>
                  <p>This is that love of Christ, that is accompanied with Faith in a Christian, and hope, and expectation of his comming.</p>
                  <p>Now then, if thou waite for Christ in truth, how commeth it, that thou dost not love him? thou canst not waite for him aright, except thou love Christ himselfe, and for himselfe.</p>
                  <p>And if thou love Christ, it will appeare, by thy care to walke <note place="margin">Care to walk in Christ.</note> in Christ: to derive vertue from him in all holy actions, to derive all heavenly wisedome, all heavenly disposition of heart from him: to please Christ in all thy wayes, to doe that whereby thou maist aprove thy selfe to God in Christ. This is the disposition of a heart loving Christ, and this is that loving of Christ for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and in himselfe that giveth me assurance, that I love the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Christ. That is the second companion of this waiting for Christ, if it be right, there is a love to Christ.</p>
                  <p>The third and last companion of a mans waiting for Christ, is <note place="margin">3. Delight in the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> the continuall affection of the heart, those same ejaculations, that intercourse, that holy and heavenly communion which the soule hath with Christ here. First in his ordinances, having a holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him in them, waiting at the <hi>Posts of the dore of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes house,</hi> to heare what Christ (who is <hi>wisedome</hi> it selfe) will speake to us: waiting if that hee will come now (in the ministrie of his Word) in his Spirit, whom we hope to enjoy fully in glory: Wayting for him likewise in the Sacraments to receive a further
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:14764:176"/>
confirmation of our faith in him: wayting for him also in prayer, to receive further consolation and strength from him. Thus <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> it is said, that She was <hi>one that waited for the consolation of Israel, and served God in the Temple in prayer day and night.</hi> So where there is a waiting for Christ, there will be a continuall intercourse of the soule with Christ, a heavenly and holy communion with him in duties.</p>
                  <p>Dost thou waite for Christs comming, and yet runne from Christs ordinances? How can these stand together? There is no man that can ever waite with comfort for Christs comming in glory, but hee that now waiteth upon Christ in his ordinances. If thy delight be in holy duties, in the worship of God, and that in such religious performances thou waitest for a further convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Spirit of Christ into thee, thou hast warrant to waite for, and to expect with comfort the second comming of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Try yourselves therefore by these things. It is not every one that saith, <hi>I would that the Lord Iesus would come, or I would that these dayes were full, and finished;</hi> It is not every one that saith thus, that rightly lookes for, or desires the comming of Christ. But he that thereby becommeth patient, and stayes, and composeth his heart in a calme and quiet temper in the middest of all crosses, and troubles, and afflictions that befall him, and that upon this ground, because Christ will come and put an end to my sinne, as well as to my sorrow, therefore I will waite with patience till hee come. And againe, hee that loveth Christ, that sigheth for his comming. And hee that now delighteth in his ordinances: this man only waiteth for the comming of Christ.</p>
                  <p>There is yet a third Tryall, and that is, the effects and fruits of <note place="margin">3. By the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and fruits of it.</note> our waiting for the comming of Christ: And that is threefold (to goe no further then the Text.)</p>
                  <p>The first is, a <hi>heavenly Conversation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second is, a mans resting on Christ as <hi>his Saviour and Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is, <hi>the change of the body,</hi> which shall bee in the great day, when the soule and body shall bee united together, <hi>Who shall change our vile body, and make it like his owne glorious body,</hi> &amp;c. But the maine fruit whereof wee are now presently possest, is a <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conversation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And so I come to the second particular included in the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation before propounded, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That nothing is so effectuall to settle a man, and to dispose him to a holy</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, the best meanes to procure a heavenly Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                     <hi>and heavenly Conversation here on earth, as the right looking for the second comming of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this is true, you shall see it briefly, how the Saints of God upon this very ground have beene wrought, and incouraged to a
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:14764:176"/>
heavenly conversation in all the parts and degrees of it.</p>
                  <p>First of all, yee shall see, that this is that which mortifieth the <note place="margin">Proved. 1. It is the worker of Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> secret lusts and corruptions of the heart. A man will never set soundly, and in truth, to the mortification of his inward corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that doth not in truth out of love to Christ looke for his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond comming. And the very reason why many are so dull and dead, and backward to this worke (for want whereof they cannot lead so heavenly a conversation upon earth) is this, because they doe not with love to Christ looke for his second comming.</p>
                  <p>And that this is so, it will appeare by divers places of Scripture. <hi>Set your affections</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>on things that are above, where</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Collos. 3. 1. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ sitteth at the right hand of God:</hi> And hee doth not only say so, but <hi>Mortifie therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>your earthly members.</hi> Wherefore should they <hi>mortifie their earthly members? because Christ sitteth at the right hand of God,</hi> upon whom yee looke, upon whom the eye of your faith is fixed: <hi>mortifie your members.</hi> For what is that that makes a man in truth to dispose and frame his heart, to bee fit to stand in the number of those that <hi>are clothed in white Robes</hi> at the second comming of Christ, but even this consideration that none shall appeare then with comfort, but such as now walke in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of conversation?</p>
                  <p>Certainly that man that doth with delight expect his second comming, hee will be most carefull to fit himselfe for the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Christ, and most diligent in setting himselfe to the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, and subduing of his corruptions, that so hee may walke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in all holinesse of life. A man that expects the comming of a King to his house: will he therefore bee secure, and doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, because hee knowes certainly that the King will come? No surely, hee will therefore, because hee is sure that hee will come, make ready and furnish his house, that it may be fit to receive him when hee doth come. Even so, because I expect the comming of the great King, <hi>the King of glory</hi> (as hee is called in <hi>Psal.</hi> 24.) I will now <hi>open my everlasting gates,</hi> I will now labour that hee may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse my soule, I will now <hi>cleanse my selfe from all filthinesse, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of flesh and spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore the Apostle Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> having said, <hi>Wee are now the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>sonnes of God, and it doth not yet appeare what wee shall be, but wee know, that when hee shall appeare, wee shall be like unto him: for wee shall see him as he is.</hi> Hee presently inferreth, <hi>Every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himselfe, even as hee is pure.</hi> Hee that hath this hope, that he shall be with Christ, <hi>that he shall see him as he is,</hi> he will bee carefull <hi>to purifie himselfe, as Christ is pure.</hi> This is the disposition of a man that truly longs, and rightly lookes for the comming of Christ, hee will be carefull <hi>to purifie himselfe.</hi> A man that expects to bee raised to some great and eminent place in the Court, hee
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:14764:177"/>
will be carefull to fit himselfe with those necessary requisites that may make him capable of it, and enable him to go through it with credit and comfort. So he that expects to to have this great honour of the Saints, to be of the number of those that receive glory and happinesse, and comfort by the second comming of Christ: hee will be carefull to purge his heart from all corruption, that it may bee capable to receive that comfort.</p>
                  <p>What daunts a man at the apprehension of death, and makes <note place="margin">Guilt of sinne causeth the apprehension of death to be terrible.</note> him have no delight in thinking of Judgement to come? but the guilt of secret sinnes, with which hee hath beene, and is so unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part. It is impossible for any man to looke with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort upon the approach of Death, and to take delight in, and desire the second comming of Christ, but hee who upon this ground is carefull to purge his heart of all secret corruptions and lusts whatsoever. This is then the first thing wherein it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that the looking for the comming of Christ, is a speciall meanes to worke us to a holy and heavenly conversation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as this is that which mortifieth the secret lusts, and <note place="margin">2. Subdues our worldly affections.</note> corruptions of the heart, so it is that also which mortifies our worldly affections. For what is it that will subdue in the heart, and purge out of it the love of the world, and worldly things but this, the looking for, and expectation of a better estate to be had in Jesus Christ at his second comming? What is it that makes men hold the world so fast? What makes them so gripple of the earth, and to cleave so close to the things of this life? But because they have no comfortable perswasion, and expectation of a better e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state afterwards. Certainly he that on a right ground, and upon good warrant can expect with comfort the second comming of Christ, he careth nothing for the things of this life. Therefore saith the Apostle; <hi>If you be risen with Christ, seeke those things which</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Collos. 3. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God:</hi> because, <hi>Christ sitteth at the right hand of God,</hi> therefore set your affections there: But how shall we come to set our affections there? <hi>Set them not</hi> (saith he) <hi>upon the things of the earth.</hi> It is necessary that the soule of a man should have something or other to fasten upon, some object to take up its delight and joy: and he that cannot have joy and delight in better things, in things above, he lookes for it in things below: and the reason why hee so cleaves to, and claspes, and hugges with delight the things below; is because hee hath no better things to thinke of, to hope after. Hee that hath a better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance to hope for, will easily let fall these things, and his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to them, because his hope is in Christ who shall make him glorious at his second comming. You see then the necessitie of it in this second respect. <note place="margin">3. Keepes us from sinfull actions.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to goe further; It is necessarie also for the avoyding of any
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:14764:177"/>
evill, of any sinne in the act. What is it that makes a man regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and square his course of life according to the rule of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so that he avoides the <hi>corruptions that are in the world through lusts?</hi> But this looking for the second comming of Christ.</p>
                  <p>This Argument <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist used to presse upon his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers the Doctrine of repentance, because <hi>the kingdome of God was at hand.</hi> This is that upon which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> groundeth his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation unto the people, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Repent</hi> (saith he) <hi>and bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A &amp;. 3. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>that your sinnes may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord:</hi> Therefore repent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne unto God, doe away your sinnes, because there will a time of refreshing come, and you had need then to be found in another hue, in another state, then in your old rotten withered condition and sinfull lusts. This is the Argument that the Apostle used to the Athenians to bring them from Idolatrie <hi>to serve the living God,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act: 17. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>because God hath appointed to judge the world in righteousnesse, by that man whom he hath ordained.</hi> Even for that reason, because <hi>God hath appointed a time to judge the world in righteousnesse,</hi> therefore they should <hi>turne from their Idols to serve the living God.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that doth so unbottome the heart, nothing so shakes and looseneth a mans hold of sinne and unrighteousnesse, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of Christs comming to Judgement. What will it boote me (will the soule reason) to keep my sins when Christ will come to judge me for my sins? What shall I get by going on in a course of a sinne, when I can looke for nothing then, but a sentence of wrath to be denounced against me? This then is that that doth set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a man in a holy conversation in that respect.</p>
                  <p>Nay fourthly, this is that also which quickneth a man to the <note place="margin">4. Quickens to holinesse of life.</note> practise of all holy duties in his place, both in his generall and particular Calling. It is the very argument which the Apostle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> useth to stirre us up to holinesse of conversation; <hi>Seeing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 11, 12.</note> (saith he) <hi>that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons ought wee to be in all holy conversation and godlinesse: looking for the comming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heate.</hi> As if hee should have said: Looke now about the whole world, and see what it is that now can comfort you, if you be such as goe on in a course of sinne: It may be you will say, I feare not much, for I have many friends: Yea, but all these shall die: It may bee thou hast store of lands: but all that shall bee burnt with fire. It may be thou hast many pleasures: but then there shall bee nothing but Judgement. The comming of the Lord, that shall then put an end to all these, and turne the course of things, the expectation thereof is a speciall meanes to take us off from a course of sinne, and put us on to a course of obedience, to make us walke in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:14764:178"/>
kind of fashion while wee are in the world. Therefore the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he would stirre up <hi>Timothy</hi> to the worke of the Ministrie, what is the Argument that hee useth? <hi>I charge thee before Christ, who shall judge the quicke and the dead.</hi> As if hee should say; there shall be an appearing before the Lord, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou wilt give thy account up with joy at that day, I charge thee to looke to thy Ministrie.</p>
                  <p>So may I say to every man in his place; <hi>I charge thee</hi> that art a Master of a Familie, looke to the businesse of thy Familie, to the salvation of the soules of thy people. <hi>I charge thee</hi> that art a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or a Mother, to looke to the salvation of the soules of thy Children. <hi>I charge thee</hi> that art a Christian, to looke to the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy owne soule. And how is the charge? <hi>I charge thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord Iesus Christ, who shall judge the quicke and dead.</hi> Because there shall come a time, when both thou and they shall bee present before Christ at his appearing, therefore if thou wilt have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in them, and in thy selfe, and in Christ; be carefull to doe the dutie that concernes thy place, <hi>looking for the comming of the Lord Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then you see in this respect also thereis nothing so forcible an Argument to settle a man in a holy conversation, in a heavenly course as this, for a man alwayes to looke for the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, there is nothing fixeth a man so constantly in a holy course as this. <hi>Our conversation</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>is alwayes in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5. Furthers our perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</note> 
                     <hi>heaven.</hi> Wee alwayes walke on earth as those that aspire to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, because wee alwayes looke for the comming of Christ. Wert thou carefull to serve God yesterday? doe it to day also: it may be Christ may come now and take thee away by death to day, and there is no preparation for judgement afterward. <hi>Little</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>children</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Iohn) now abide in him, that when hee shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, wee may have confidence, and not bee ashamed before him at his comming.</hi> What is it that giveth a man boldnesse, and takes away shame from him at the comming of Christ? What is the reason that a man hath not that spirit of feare and trembling upon him, that shall bee upon the hearts of all those that goe on in sinne, when they shall cry to the mountaines to fall upon them? but this <note place="margin">Rev. 6.</note> that hee hath continued in a holy conversation, and constantly walked before the Lord with an upright heart. <hi>I have finished my course</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have kept the faith, hence-forth is layd up for mee a crowne of righteousnesse, which Christ the righteous Iudge shall give to mee, and to all them that love his appearing.</hi> Still the servants of God have incouraged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to persevere in a holy course, from the expectation of the comming of Christ, that will give them a reward for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:14764:178"/>
in his service. It is the Argument that the holy Ghost u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> Rev. 3. 11. <hi>Hold fast that thou</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>hast, and let no man take thy crowne.</hi> As if hee should say, There is a time comming when Crownes shall bee given: but to whom? to those that hold out, that persevere in a godly course, <hi>Be thou faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the death, and thou shalt receive a crowne of glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is that, I say, that will make a man goe on, will make him that is good in youth, be good in age also; because whensoever he dieth, he shall receive his Crowne. This will make a man that he shall not <hi>begin in the spirit, and end in the flesh:</hi> this will make him, that <hi>having put his hand to the plough, hee will not looke backe;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee no further lookes for comfort in the appearance of Christ, then hee hath had care to walke on constantly in a good course.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see the point proved to you, that a Christian soule hath a maine benefit by his looking for the second comming of Christ; and that this is it that makes him carefull to mortifie his secret lusts: that this is it that makes him carefull to purge himselfe from worldly affections: that this is it that makes him industrious to avoide evill courses: that this is it that makes him diligent in good actions; that this is it that makes him constant, and to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to the end in all holy wayes, and in avoyding of all evill: because he lookes for, and waites for the comming of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Now then take this for a maine tryall of your selves concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> For tryall.</note> the former point. Whether can you with comfort looke for the comming of Christ or no?</p>
                  <p>There shall bee abundance at that day, that shall hang downe their heads: <hi>I saw</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Divine) <hi>the Kings of the</hi>

                     <hi>earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chiefe Captaines, and the mighty men, and every bond-man, and every free-man</hi> (men of all sorts) <hi>hid themselves in the dens, and in the rocks of the mountaines, and said to the mountaines and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lambe, for the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall bee able to stand?</hi> Would you therefore hold up your heads with comfort and with joy? that when you heare a <hi>Funerall Sermon,</hi> it might comfort you to thinke, It will not be long before my time shall come, before my time shall bee? would you in truth have <hi>freedome from the feare</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>of death,</hi> which Christ hath purchased? <hi>(for hee tooke upon him the same nature, because the children were partakers of flesh and blood, that hee might free them, who for feare of death were held in bondage all their life.)</hi> Would you have comfort in Christs comming to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? See how effectually this workes in you.</p>
                  <p>Is it thus effectuall, that because you looke for Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, therefore you prepare your selves; therefore you purge
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:14764:179"/>
out your lusts and corruptions, because there shall bee nothing then <hi>(when the secrets of all hearts shall bee manifest)</hi> that shall bee displeasing to him when hee shall come? Are you carefull to let fall worldly affections, because you have a comfortable appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of heavenly joyes? Are you carefull to turne your course from sinne, because you would not lye open to the <hi>judgement of condemnation?</hi> Are you carefull to doe good, to persevere in the practise of godlinesse, because <hi>hee that shall come, will come, and will not tarry?</hi> If it bee thus with you, then you may with comfort thinke of that day, then you may with cheerefulnesse looke upon the day of death: <hi>the day of death then, is better then the day in which thou wert borne:</hi> It is better to thee then the day of thy mariage, it is the day of that great Mariage that shall bee made betweene Christ and thy soule to all eternitie: It is better then the day that thou obtainest thy freedome, then the day that thou commest out of thy Apprentiship: it is the day wherein thou ait set free, and brought into <hi>the glorious liberty of the sonnes of God:</hi> It is a day that is better then the day of the enjoyment of the greatest comforts of this life, because it sets thee in the possession of <hi>pleasures that are at Gods right hand for evermore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take this consideration therefore to heart: and that you may walke in a holy course the better, and with more constancie, keepe the object alwayes close to your eye. Thinke with your selves and say: If wee would walke as Saints in heaven, wee must live as Saints on earth. But how shall wee doe this? Be often thinking of the comming of Christ: often put this question to your soules; What if Christ should now come? If hee should come now I am in the Church, am I hearing the Word with that affection that I ought to heare it with? If hee should come now I am in my calling, in my worldly businesse, doe I follow it with a heavenly disposition as I ought to doe? What if hee should come now while I am feasting, should he take mee as one feasting with feare lest I should sinne against God in my mirth? What if hee should come and take mee asleepe, have I made my peace with God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I went to rest?</p>
                  <p>Worke these considerations upon thy soule. When the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning commeth, thinke, it may be Christ will come and take mee away before evening, how shall I walke this day, that I may have comfort in the comming of Christ? When the Evening is come, thinke, It may be I shall never see morning before the great day of the Resurrection, what now shall I doe, that if I die in my sleepe I may rest in the Lord, and so may have comfort in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance? Either this moment, either this minute, settle thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and peace with Christ; or it may bee the next houre it will be too late. And remember that if ever you will live a holy life, if
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:14764:179"/>
ever you will have a heavenly conversation on earth, you must be much, and seriously settled in this meditation: slight it not: passe it not in your thoughts as a matter of discourse, but let it bee a working meditation, let it bee effectuall to produce somewhat in you that may warme and heat your hearts, and to set on fire the whole soule, and to purge out the drosse of corruption that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines in you.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see what it is that the Apostle here undertakes for himselfe, and for as many as walked as hee did: they had <hi>a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conversation,</hi> and that which made them have <hi>a heavenly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,</hi> was the <hi>looking for the comming of Christ.</hi> This was the fruit of their looking for the comming of Christ, it made them walke in a heavenly conversation on earth.</p>
                  <p>There is another fruit of this: by their looking for Christ, they shall find him to bee a Lord and Jesus: <hi>Wee looke for the Saviour the Lord Iesus:</hi> Which word sheweth, that all that Christ did for the purchase of our redemption, hee did it by price, and by power.</p>
                  <p>Hee did it by price, hee satisfied his Fathers Justice, and so hee is a Saviour: <hi>Wee waite</hi> (saith the Apostle 1 <hi>Thes. 1. 10.) for his Son</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Thes. 1. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>from heaven, whom hee raised from the dead, even Iesus, which delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us from the wrath to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And by power too, over Sathan: so hee is a Lord, the Lord of might. Thou shalt find at the day of Christ, that hee will both bee Saviour and Lord to thee. A Saviour to free thee from sinne and condemnation; A Lord, to bestow upon thee heaven, and glory with the Saints. This is another benefit of our looking for Christs comming in the manner before spoken of, wee shall find him then to be a Lord, and Jesus: one that will save us from our sinnes, and one that hath power to bestow heaven upon us.</p>
                  <p>Wouldest thou then have this comfort at that day? Let him bee so here to thee in this life: let him be thy Lord and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all thy affections, of the wholeman, yeeld obedience now to his will, and thou shalt find him a Jesus then. Hee is not a Jesus, a Saviour, except hee be a Lord and Commander also. But you see I cannot stand to insist upon this.</p>
                  <p>The occasion of our meeting at this time, is to commit to the Earth the body of our sister departed: Shee hath now the termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and conclusion of all her wayting and expectation. And after so long a wayting, there remaineth a sleeping in the Grave a while, when the soule resteth in the hands of Christ, and waiteth for that great day, when body and soule shall be joyned together.</p>
                  <p>I perswade my selfe well of her, that Shee was one of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those wayters that shall have joy at the comming of Christ, I had not much knowledge of her: only I observed in her sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse a good purpose and desire of new and better obedience, and
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:14764:180"/>
performing better service to Christ then shee had done, if God should have spared her longer. And shee expressed also a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Christs second comming: a desire that hee would receive her to himselfe, and that these dayes of sinne might bee fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. Much she was in these desires, and she had good warrant for it: for shee was carefull (as I am informed) to set up the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ in her Family. It is the dutie of a good Wife to be a helpe to her Husband, especially in matters of piety, and the worship of God: and therein her example should teach wives to strive herein. Shee was alwayes stirring him up to prayer in his Familie, to a more carefull sanctifying of the Lords day, herein Shee was frequent. Shee was much mortified to the world for some late yeares (as it was observed in her daily course by those that knew her.) Thus she laboured to fit her selfe and her Familie, that shee might have comfort in the great Day of the appearing of the Lord Jesus.</p>
                  <p>I speake upon information, for your edification, to stirre you up to labour to fit your selves for Christ by purging out of sinne in your hearts and lives: Labour to fit your Families for Christ, that when you, and your servants and children shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before him, you may looke on them, and looke on Christ with comfort, as men that before have prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for the comming of Christ, and as those that then shall lift up their heads, because the day of their redemption draweth nigh.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not long (men and brethren) since <hi>Death</hi> rode in triumph thorow this Citie, and did beare downe all before him: hee locked up your houses, pulled downe your windowes, and made the wealthiest among you put upon them the semblance of Banckroutnesse, by locking up their dores, and turning their backes to their houses, and running away, so it played the Tyrant then: there died thousands a-weeke and the Grave that alwayes cryeth, <hi>Give, give,</hi> was almost cloyed with carkasses: <hi>Death</hi> served himselfe so fast, that the Prison could scarse hold the Prisoners: It might almost have beene said then of this Citie, as once it was of Egypt; <hi>There was scarse a house wherein some were not dead,</hi> at least where there was not the feare of <hi>Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it hath pleased God to shew you more favour, and men now die but by scores; <hi>Death</hi> goeth his old pace, and takes away a few secretly without observation. But <hi>Death</hi> is amongst you still, and still will be so long as sinne is among you: and therefore
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:14764:182"/>
it will not bee unseasonable upon this occasion for mee to speake, and you to heare somewhat that may arme you against this <hi>last</hi> and and worst <hi>Enemy, Death:</hi> which though hee make not such a stirre in these times of lesse Mortalitie, yet hee will certainly take us all away one by one: And who can tell but hee may be amongst the number of the hundred, or fewer hundreds that die now, as no man could tell whether hee should be amongst the number of the thousands then?</p>
                  <p>Since <hi>Death</hi> therefore is alwayes an enemie, and alwayes fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against us (though not alwayes with like furie and violence) it is a part of wisedome in us alwayes to heare, and to practise that which may secure us against the danger of death. And that is taught in this Text.
<q>Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keepe my saying, hee shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver see death.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherein (not to speake any thing of the Context) I pray take <note place="margin">Division.</note> notice who speakes the words.</p>
                  <p>The Authour of truth: the Death of <hi>Death,</hi> hee that can best tell by what meanes a man may shun the hurt of it: hee that hath vanquished it, and overcome the uttermost of his assaults: <hi>Our Lord Iesus Christ, that hath slaine death, and brought life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to light.</hi> Hee giveth us this direction for the avoyding of the hurt of <hi>Death.</hi> Then observe the manner of his speaking.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verily, verily, I say unto you:</hi> with an affirmation earnest and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled. Hee never affirmed any thing untrue, therefore that which hee speakes is an undoubted verity. Hee never spake any thing rashly, therefore that which hee affirmed so earnestly, is a weighty thing, and of great consequence.</p>
                  <p>And lastly observe (that which I only shall insist upon) the matter of his direction here comprehended in a hypotheticall proposition, which hath (as all such have) two parts. An Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, and a Consequent. In the one hee sheweth the Dutie to bee done as a necessary condition for the obtaining of that which is specified in the other. The first hath the Dutie; The second the benefit that floweth from the Dutie. These two are knit together in a most necessary consequence. <hi>If a man keepe my word, hee shall never see death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You see now the only, and perfect remedie against the evill of <hi>Death;</hi> that is, <hi>to keepe the saying and word of Christ.</hi> If any would <note place="margin">1. The dutie commanded.</note> know by what meanes he may bee secured against the terrible of all terrible things (as one calleth <hi>Death)</hi> here is a sure and certaine rule for him, and hee need not doubt of it, it commeth from the mouth of Christ, let him <hi>keepe his saying,</hi> and then <hi>Death</hi> shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doe him harme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="347" facs="tcp:14764:182"/>
I will first interpret these words unto you, and then make them good by Scripture and Reason, and then apply them, and commit my selfe and you; and all at last to the blessing of God.</p>
                  <p>First then, when our Saviour Christ saith; <hi>If a man:</hi> wee must <note place="margin">Meaning of the words.</note> conceive him to meane generally, at least indefinitely, <hi>If any man whatsoever:</hi> for so it pleaseth him to inlarge his promise in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling of the word, that no man may have cause to say hee is excluded, except hee exclude himselfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Keepe my sayings.</hi> Here first I must shew you what is meant by <hi>sayings:</hi> and then what it is to keepe those sayings.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Saying, or words of Christ,</hi> is, <hi>the Doctrine of the Gospell, the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">What is meant by the saying of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> The Doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</note> 
                     <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> which by an excellency is called His: because by it hee bringeth <hi>life and immortality to light</hi> (as I said before) which in former times was hid as it were in the darke, and not made knowne so publikely to the sonnes of men. The Gentiles knew little or nothing of it. The <hi>Iewes</hi> knew what they knew with much darknesse and obscurity. Hee that was (almost) the first Preacher of this Gospell in cleare termes without any vaile or darknesse <hi>(Iohn Baptist)</hi> who was as it were betweene both, hee did deliver this doctrine not so darkly as the Prophets before him, nor so clearely, as after it was by our blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> and those that succeeded him. Therefore I say, it is the <hi>Saying</hi> of Christ by an excellency, because hee did in a manner first begin to teach and declare the same, in the clearenesse and sweetnesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and hee sent his Apostles abroad to make it plaine and manifest to all the world, <hi>that a man may runne and reade it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And His likewise it is called, because hee is the Authour of it, for hee is the worker of that salvation which it declareth to us.</p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>Doctrine of the Gospell</hi> hath two parts.</p>
                  <p>The first acquainting us with our miserie. <note place="margin">Two parts of the Gospell.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second with the Remedie.</p>
                  <p>For as the Bond and Acquittance specifie the debt, but to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent purposes, the one to tie the Debtor to the payment, the <note place="margin">1. Shewing our miserie.</note> other to absolve and acquit him: even so the Law and the Gospell both declare the miserie of man, the one to tie it fast upon him, the other to helpe him the better to loose it from him. The Physitian intreateth of the sicknesse as well as the Cure, but of the sicknesse alone for the cures sake. The Judge passeth a sentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and then largely rehearseth the crime and punishment due to the offender: the Pardon likewise makes mention of the fault, and the punishment, but in a different manner, and to a different end. So the Gospell declareth mans miserie, and borroweth so much of the Law, that may lay downe our wretched estate in our selves, and so draw in that which is the maine and principall part of it, the remedie of our soules. And this part of the Gospell the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:14764:183"/>
Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> succinctly delivereth in a few words, <hi>Rom. 3. 23. All have sinned, and are come short of the glory of God: All have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 23.</note> and <hi>All have sinned</hi> in such a sort, and measure, and degree, that they are fallen <hi>short of that Glory of God,</hi> by which the Apostle (I thinke) meaneth, life Eternall: that Glory, that (had it not been for sinne) he would have bestowed upon the sonnes of men, by vertue of the first Covenant he made with them.</p>
                  <p>The second part of the Gospell, the words of Christ, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">2. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die against this miserie.</note> the Remedie, whereby a man may be helped against this miserie. And for that purpose it sheweth us, <hi>Who helpeth us; And how hee helpes us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And what is to bee done by our selves, that wee may obtaine and enjoy this helpe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Person that helpeth us, is the Sonne, <hi>Manifest in the flesh,</hi> the Sonne of God taking our nature upon him, and clothing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the similitude of sinfull flesh: <hi>the Eternall Sonne of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</note> assuming (I say) the very nature of man into the unitie of his Person, so becomming God and Man in the same Person, hee is the sole <hi>Redeemer, neither is there any other name under heaven by which wee can be saved,</hi> but by his alone.</p>
                  <p>Againe, it sheweth us by what meanes hee saveth us: as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <note place="margin">2. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how we are redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Rom. 3. 24.</note> speakes plaine enough in the next verse to that I spake of before, <hi>being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Iesus Christ.</hi> To the intent that hee might free us from the <hi>Curse of the Law,</hi> and wrath of God, and the danger of eternall <hi>Death,</hi> he vouchsafed to be <hi>made sinne for us,</hi> to satisfie the justice of his Father, by enduring the <hi>Curse of the Law,</hi> and to accomplish the <hi>Righteousnesse of the Law,</hi> by being made (in our stead) <hi>under the Law;</hi> so he he became a Propitiation for the sins of the sons of men, as the Apostle saith in that place. Thus Christ by his perfect satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction made to his Father, and by that perfect <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> whereby hee was subject to the Law for our sakes, hath absolutly and fully delivered us from the power of sinne and of <hi>Death,</hi> and performed the worke of our <hi>Redemption:</hi> by vertue whereof, by the merit, and worth, and value whereof wee are delivered, and saved, and Redeemed from this <hi>Death,</hi> and from all other evils that crosse our eternall happinesse.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, the Gospell sheweth us by what means we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come partakers of this happinesse and <hi>Redemption</hi> in Christ: and <note place="margin">3. The means how to enjoy the remedie.</note> telleth us of three things, (as it were) Conditions of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace,</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> which is ratified by the bloud of Christ. I say of three things, the Conditions (on our parts) of that Covenant, which if wee doe, we shall certainly bee saved by the <hi>Redemption in Christ.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Covenant of Grace.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first is <hi>Repentance.</hi>

The second is <hi>Beleeving.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is our <hi>New obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All and each of these plainly exprest in the word of God.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Repentance,</hi> it is that wherewith <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist began <note place="margin">1. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> his Preaching. It is that that our <hi>Saviour</hi> commanded his Apostles to declare to the <hi>Iewes, Repent, for the kingdome of heaven is at hand.</hi> It is that which himselfe preached at the first, as Saint <hi>Marke</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, chap. 1. 15. It is that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> began with, when hee came to the Athenians, <hi>Act. 17. and now hee admonisheth all men</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mark. 1. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>every where to repent.</hi> It was the first of the foundations of the <hi>Doctrine of the beginning of Christ,</hi> that was wont to bee taught in <note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> the Ancient Church, as witnesseth the Authour to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> chap. 6. <hi>not laying againe the foundation of repentance from dead works,</hi> and then he proceedeth to the rest. This <hi>Repentance</hi> is that which the Lord requireth absolutely of the sonnes of men, as a condition of the new Covenant, the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> without which they cannot possibly be made partakers of the same.</p>
                  <p>And this <hi>Repentance</hi> hath 4. parts, every one of which is so <note place="margin">The parts of Repentance.</note> needfull, that without it the rest is little worth.</p>
                  <p>First lamenting for our sinnes, and being sorry for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <note place="margin">Godly sorrow for sinne. Psal. 38.</note> as <hi>David</hi> said of himselfe, <hi>Psal. 38. I will declare my iniquitie, and bee sorry for my sinnes.</hi> And so the Apostle Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth it, <hi>chap. 4. 9. Afflict your selves, mourne and weepe, let your laughter bee turned into sorrow, and your joy into teares.</hi> Therefore <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>am. 4. 9.</note> Christ you know was sent to <hi>Preach glad tydings to the Prisoners and Captives, and the opening of the prison to the prisoners, and to bring the oyle of gladnesse to those that mourned in Sion.</hi> A man must first be a <hi>Mourner in Sion,</hi> one that <hi>smiteth on his thigh,</hi> and saith with <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, Woe to mee because I have sinned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, to this <hi>Sorrow</hi> must bee joyned acknowledgement, <note place="margin">Confession of sinne.</note> and <hi>confession of sinne</hi> to Almighty God, for so witnesseth the <hi>Wise-man,</hi> Prov. 28. <hi>If wee confesse and leave our sinnes, wee shall have</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 28. Psal. 32. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>mercy.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal. 32. 3, 4. I said I will confesse my sinnes, and thou forgavest the iniquitie of my sinne.</hi> And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> telleth us in his 1. <hi>Epist. 1. 9. If wee confesse our sinnes, God is faithfull and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>true to forgive us our sinnes.</hi> So you see <hi>Confession</hi> as well as sorrow absolutely required to obtaine remission. A man must even Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, and as it were indite himselfe before God, plead guiltie, acknowledge his trespasse whatsoever it bee, and judge himselfe worthy to bee destroyed for them, or else hee repents not though he weepe out his eyes with mourning and lamentation.</p>
                  <p>The third thing requisite is, a firme purpose of amendment of <note place="margin">Firme pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment.</note> life. Whosoever will have God to accept his teares, and bend a favourable eare to his humiliation and acknowledgement, he must so acknowledge what evill hee hath already done, that he put on a
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:14764:184"/>
stedfast purpose of doing so no more: according to the direction that our Saviour Christ giveth to the man that hee had healed, <hi>Ioh. 5. Goe thy way and sinne no more:</hi> and as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speakes, <hi>Let</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>him that stole, steale no more:</hi> And therefore the Wiseman putteth on this part to the former, in the before alledged place, <hi>If wee confesse our sinnes, and leave them, wee shall find mercie.</hi> There must be (I say) a settled purpose, and a fixed flat determination in the soule of every man to cast off those transgressions that hee hath confest, and to returne no more to commit them, atleast not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low those sinnes that he hath acknowledged.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, there must be added to the former three, or else they <note place="margin">Petition for patdon in the name of Christ.</note> will not availe neither, an earnest supplication to God for mercy, and forgivenesse through the mediation of his welbeloved Son Jesus Christ: which was wont to bee <hi>craving mercie</hi> without this mentioning of Christ, before hee was offered, and revealed to the world. But now it must be so done, as wee must specially and particularly preferre our thoughts and desires to him, in begging mercie at his Fathers hands for his sake alone. So <hi>David,</hi> after the numbring of the people, <hi>I have done exceeding foolishly, but Lord blot out, forgive the sinne of thy servant:</hi> So God commandeth, <hi>Hos.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 14. 2.</note> 14. 2. <hi>Take to you words, and say to the Lord, receive us graciously.</hi> So did <hi>David</hi> when he renewed his <hi>repentance,</hi> (and so must all men doe when they begin to repent) <hi>Have mercy upon mee according to the multitude of thy mercies, and blot out my transgressions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>These are the parts of repentace. And this is the first thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at our hands, as the condition of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> without which wee can never obtaine life eternall. And this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance consisteth of <hi>sorrow</hi> for sinne, and acknowledgement of it to God, with a firme purpose of amendment, and earnest petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of pardon, for the sake of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>And this is such a Doctrine as the <hi>Covenant of workes,</hi> the Law, <note place="margin">Repentance only taught in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</note> never taught to the sonnes of men: Nay, verily it will not admit it: the Law scornes (as it were) to admit repentance, for it exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth sinne: <hi>Repentance</hi> implieth sinne in all the degrees and kindes, therefore it is farre from accepting <hi>Repentance:</hi> If thou hast once broke the Law, repent, or not repent; Amend, or not amend; be sorry, or not sorry, thou shalt never be pardoned or forgiven: It is a rough and sterne Schoolemaster, that will whip and scourge offending children, though they crave pardon never so much: It is a rough Creditour that will throttle the Debtour, and cast him into Prison though he confesse the debt, and be never so importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in asking favour and patience.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> it is a sweet Doctrine, a comfortable Doctrine. Thou hast sinned, oh man, and broken the Law, and fallen from the favour of God, and all possibility of salvation in
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:14764:184"/>
thy selfe: but come, be sorry for thy sinne, acknowledge it to thy Maker; resolve to runne on in it no longer, crie to him for pardon of it; hee will graciously pardon thee. This is a sweet Doctrine <note place="margin">Mans repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance tends to the honour of Gods justice.</note> you see, full of comfort and consolation: yet it is a Doctrine that tendeth to the honour of the Justice of God, as well as to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his grace and love: the Lord could not pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>me and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for mercie and favour, and confesse that hee hath offended, and promise never to doe so againe? there is no mercy and pardon for such a one, because mercie must not oppose Justice, though it may somewhat (as we may say) mittigate Justice. The bloud of Christ if it were shed tenne thousand times over, it could never corrupt the Justice of God: it may satisfie it, but not corrupt it: now the Justice of God were corrupted, if it should admit an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent and hard-hearted sinner to favour, and bestow upon him remission of sinnes and life everlasting, that would never leave it, nor forsake it, nor bee sorry for it, but still goe on to offend God, and trample under foot his authoritie: this being contrary to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in the very nature and essence of Justice, it cannot possibly bee effected, no not by the shedding of the bloud of Christ: the bloud of Christ is of that value, that it satisfieth the Justice of God, and causeth him upon the penitence and humiliation of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to receive him to grace and favour.</p>
                  <p>You see now what is the first part of the Condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired on our side for the obtaining of life by Christ, that is <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next is, Faith in Christ.</p>
                  <p>This wee are taught every where: <hi>If thou beleeve in the Lord</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Faith. Joh. 6. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> (saith the Apostle to the trembling Jaylour) <hi>thou shalt bee saved.</hi> And (saith our Saviour) <hi>this is the worke of God, that yee beleeve on him whom hee hath sent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This beleeving on <hi>Christ,</hi> is I suppose nothing else but a stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Definition of Faith.</note> and resting, and depending, and relying upon the merits and satisfaction of our blessed Saviour, by the vertue and merit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to obtaine remission of sinnes, and eternall life, and all good things promised in the <hi>New Covenant</hi> at the hands of God. He that goeth quite out of himselfe, forgetteth all his owne actions, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth behind him whatsoever seemed good in him, and wholly claspeth on Christ, and cleaveth to him, staieth on him, resteth on him for the remission of sinnes, and for the favour of God, and for grace and salvation, this man beleeveth in the Lord Jesus Christ: and this man performes that dutie which makes him one
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:14764:185"/>
with Christ; that causeth him to become a member of that misti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body whereof Christ is the head: and that causeth him to be one with the Father, and to be the child of God, <hi>for by faith wee are become the children of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Faith in Christ</hi> the Law doth not teach, the former <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Faith only taught in the Gospell.</note> would not accept: What? to bring to the Law, the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of another, the satisfaction of another, and to trust upon that to be entertained and received, the Law rejects it. Thou must pay thy selfe, in thy owne person, and with thy owne goods, thou must yeeld perfect obedience to the Law, and fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish it in thy owne person: it will not receive payment of another for thee: it will not accept satisfaction of the righteousnesse of another on thy behalfe.</p>
                  <p>But, oh the sweetnesse of the Doctrine of the Gospell. If we have a Treasurer that is able, and willing to pay the debt, that will tender and make payment of it, we shall be accepted for his sake; so that we give him the glory of resting upon this payment, and be not so absurd as to mixe any action of our owne to that payment, that he hath made fully and compleatly for us. This is a Doctrine of sweetnesse, and favour, and great compassion, that though we cannot doe it of our selves, we shall be accepted, if our Suretie will doe it for us, so that wee give our Suretie the glory of being a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and able pay-master, and relie wholly upon his satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The last part of the condition on our side, is that we yeeld <hi>New obedience</hi> to the Law: Perfectly to obey it: to which wee are tyed <note place="margin">3. New obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</note> by the former Covenant.</p>
                  <p>But now this is the obedience of the Gospell, a thing farre different from the obedience of the Law that was formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <note place="margin">How diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced from that required under the Law.</note> in the old Covenant: there a man was tyed, and bound to obey perfectly, fully, compleatly, without any defect: In a word, hee must pay the uttermost farthing; hee must doe his dutie, his whole dutie, in all the parts and degrees, with all fulnesse of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, absolutely without any defect or want, without any imperfection at all. An impossible labour for corrupted man: a service that none (all having lost those abilities that God gave man at the first) can ever reach to. But then commeth the sweet Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, the Doctrine of grace and favour, of tender compassion, and saith thus; <hi>If thou wilt consent to obey, thou shalt eate the good things of the Land: If you mortifie the deedes of the body by the spirit, you shall live,</hi> Rom. 8. 13. But if you (though never so much in shew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Covenant of Grace) <hi>live after the flesh, you shall die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yee see, <hi>New Obedience</hi> is required absolutely as a Condition of the Gospell, for the obtaining of everlasting happinesse, for the escaping of Death: and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith; <hi>If wee walke in the light, wee have fellowship <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ne with another, and the bloud of Christ shall purge
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:14764:185"/>
us from all sinne:</hi> so that this <hi>walking in the light,</hi> and <hi>New Obedience,</hi> is absolutely required of all those that intend to bee made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Christ and his benefits: they must give up their soules and bodies as instruments of his glory, and not serve sinne any longer <hi>in the lusts thereof:</hi> they must not <hi>give their members as weapons of unrighteousnesse</hi> to sinne, but live as becommeth them that are one with Christ, mortifying all the lusts of the flesh, and quicken themselves, or being quickned with him, to practise all good things required in his word, and to obey all his commands, which was first written in <hi>Adams</hi> heart, and then in <hi>Tables of stone.</hi> This <hi>New Obedience</hi> is the same in substance that was required in the former Covenant, but now with a gracious acceptation of endevour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perfection in stead of perfection: the former tyed us to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of all that was required, in all fulnesse, and then promising acceptance; but the obedience that the Gospell requires, is stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to this perfection in truth and sincerity, desiring and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after it, in putting out our selves towards it, and then promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing acceptance through the perfection of Christ, in and by which our imperfections are done away.</p>
                  <p>Now (Brethren) you understand what this <hi>saying</hi> of the Lord Christs is, by vertue of the keeping of which we must be secured (if wee be secured) from the hurt of Death.</p>
                  <p>What is it now to <hi>Keepe the saying of Christ?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is to informe our Judgements in the understanding of these <note place="margin">What it to keepe the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ.</note> truths, and assent to them as truths, and to practise and follow them, to doe the duties which wee have heard, to practise the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Beleeving,</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confesse our Saviour doth proclaime it thus, <hi>Repent and beleeve the Gospell:</hi> but for the more cleere explaining of it, we make new <hi>Obedience</hi> a thing of it selfe, and not included in the <hi>Doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:</hi> for it is an act of that whereof <hi>Repentance</hi> is a resolute wishing and desiring. A man cannot possibly rest on Christ for salvation, till hee hath so asked pardon, as hee resolveth an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and when hee hath this resolution, and relyeth on Christ for the pardon of his sinne, then from him hee receiveth power to amendment of life, and so his purpose commeth to action, and his desire to execution. Thus alone these two things differ as farre as I conceive.</p>
                  <p>Now I say, this is the <hi>Doctrine of the Gospell,</hi> and to keepe it, is to know, and beleeve, and follow it, to beleeve and obey: as Christ saith, <hi>If you know these things;</hi> there is one part of the duty, <hi>happy are you if you doe them:</hi> there is asecond; for they can never be done, except they be done as knowne. And thus I have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted the first part of the proposition, namely, the <hi>Antecedent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us say somewhat of the latter too, the benefit that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">2. The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</note>
                     <pb n="354" facs="tcp:14764:186"/>
upon the former duty, and for the obtaining of which the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer duty is necessary, namely, <hi>that hee shall never see death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is it to see <hi>Death?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what <hi>Death</hi> is meant here?</p>
                  <p>To see good things in the Scripture phrase, is as much often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <note place="margin">What it is to see Death.</note> as to enjoy them, to have the benefit and commoditie of them, to receive them, to entertaine them: <hi>Without holinesse no man shall see God;</hi> that is, no man shall enjoy God: <hi>Blessed are the poore in spirit, for they shall see God;</hi> that is, they shall enjoy God.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, to see a thing that is tearmed Evill, is to bee annoyed with it, to have the hurt of it lying upon a man, and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him downe: as they in <hi>Ieremy</hi> said, <hi>Let us goe into Egypt, where wee shall not see sword or famine;</hi> meaning, that they should not be pursued by warre, and want of things needfull: so that by seeing evill, is meant the evill lying upon one, and annoying and hurting one: and so I suppose it is meant here.</p>
                  <p>And by <hi>Death,</hi> is meant, Naturall, and (as we may tearme it,) <note place="margin">What Death is here meant.</note> supernaturall, and eternall Death: For the <hi>keeping of Christs say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> so freeth men from the latter, as they never come neere it: and so freeth them from the former, as they never dread to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of the latter. And the first Death of the outward man, which is the separration of the Body from the Soule, it is no <hi>Death</hi> if it separate not both from God, which it can never doe, <hi>if a man keepe the sayings of Christ:</hi> therefore though his body (that <hi>keepeth the sayings of Christ)</hi> bee tooke from his soule, yet he <hi>seeth not death</hi> so as to have any hurt by it, hee feeleth no ill by it: nay, it is good to him, for it is a passage from miserie to rest and felicitie.</p>
                  <p>Thus yee have these words as faithfully interpreted to you, as I know how.</p>
                  <p>And now I will make proofe of this Doctrine thus explicated, namely that thus to <hi>keepe Christs sayings,</hi> to know and follow the <hi>Doctrine of the Gospell,</hi> is the only sure way to escape the danger and hurt of <hi>Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> acknowledgeth as much, when he said to the Lord Jesus Christ; that hee had the <hi>words of eternall life,</hi> then he that <hi>kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 68.</note> 
                     <hi>them</hi> is certainly safe against the hurt of <hi>Death.</hi> So the Angell speakes to the Apostles whom the Pharisees had imprisoned, <note place="margin">Act. 5. 20.</note> when he brought them forth of Prison, he biddeth them speake to the people <hi>the words of this life:</hi> since Christs Doctrine is the word of life, it must needs follow, that the keeping thereof is a per<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a perfect <hi>Antidote</hi> against the poyson of Death. And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:14764:186"/>
appointed <hi>Cornelius</hi> to send for him, <hi>that he might speake words to him whereby himselfe, and his family should be saved:</hi> and those words which cause a man to be saved, you know will give him freedome enough from Death.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have proved the point by expresse Texts: and there are <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> two reasons of it.</p>
                  <p>The first is delivered by the Apostle Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his first E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, and second Chapter, where hee saith, <hi>let that abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning</hi> (that is the Doctrine of the <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 24.</note> Gospell which Christ taught, his sayings) <hi>if that remaine in you, you also shall continue in the Sonne, and in the Father.</hi> Hee that hath fellowship with the Sonne, and with the Father can never see <hi>Death,</hi> for God is the fountaine of life: therefore those that are one with him, and continue in him, cannot see <hi>Death</hi> no more then he can be overwhelmed with darknesse, that is where the Sunne shineth fully, no more then the body can bee dead, as long as it hath communion with the soule: so those in whom the word of Christ remaineth and stayeth, they are assured that they shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine with the Father and the Sonne: and therefore being united to that that is life, God the Father, and the Sonne, it is impossible that ever they should be hurt by the first, or ever at all taste of the last <hi>Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, the <hi>Word</hi> of Christ freeth him in who it remaineth <note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> from the power and hurt of finne, bringing to him remission of sinnes, and sanctification. And being free from sinne the cause of Death, it is easie to conjecture that hee shall bee freeed from Death itselfe. Let a mans Debt be satisfied, and let the favour of the Prince be obtained, and a Pardon granted, the Prison shall never hold him long, he shall not be brought to the place of Execution, but when his guives are knocked off, he is set at libertie: so when we have obtained power against sinne by the powerfull worke of the Spirit of God, which alwayes at the same time doth bend the heart of man to rest on Christ for salvation, and heartily to inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to walke before him in holinesse and righteousnesse: when I say wee are thus freed from the power and guilt of sinne, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that Death should lay hold upon us as his prisoner, to carry us to the dungeon of Hell, and to hold us under the wrath of God, and that fiery indignation of his that causeth Hell to bee Hell. Therefore certainly the words of Christ are an undoubted truth, and we must rest upon them without all distrust and wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that <hi>hee that keepeth his saying shall never see death,</hi> and that the knowledge, and beleeving, and obeying the <hi>Doctrine of the Gospell,</hi> is the only sure way to escape the hurt and ill of Death it selfe.</p>
                  <p>Let us now make some Application of this Doctrine to our soules.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="356" facs="tcp:14764:187"/>
First, to stirre us up to a right hearty thankfulnesse unto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that is pleased to cast our times and dayes, into that <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Intitation to thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> age and those places where the <hi>Doctrine of the Gospell,</hi> this <hi>Saying</hi> of our blessed Saviour is so clearely and plainly, and evidently laid open to you, and frequently and earnestly prest upon your soules: where the Lord commeth to declare unto you the way to life; where he scoreth you out a path, that will bring you quite out of the clutches and danger of Death, this is the happinesse of our present Age, and place where wee live, and this whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome too. The grace and mercie, and favour of our loving God hath so disposed of us, that wee doe not live in times of Paganisme and darknesse where there was no newes of Christ: that wee live not in places of Popish darknesse, where the <hi>Doctrine of the Gospell</hi> is so mixed and darkned with tricks and devises of their owne, that they cannot see Christ clearely. It is our happinesse, I say, that wee doe not live in those places, and times where either Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganisme or Poperie with their darknesse covered Christ from us, and caused us that we could not clearely see or heare him, and so not <hi>keepe his sayings:</hi> But now grace is offered, light is tendred to us: wee may be saved, wee may escape the danger of damnation, if the fault be not solely and wholly in our carelesnesse and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, and neglect, and abuse of the meanes that God hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us.</p>
                  <p>The heathen men that have not heard of Christ cannot possibly attaine to life (as farre as we can Judge by the Scripture.) And it is very difficult for the Papists (that heare so darkely, and are told of the <hi>Doctrine of the Gospell,</hi> with so many sophistications) to come to be saved. But for us that have the <hi>Doctrine of the Gospell</hi> so plainly, and carefully taught us, and revealed unto us, wee may be saved, and may easily see the way to obtaine salvation. So we goe beyond them in happinesse.</p>
                  <p>Oh blessed be the name of the Ever-living God, that beside the peace and plenty, and other temporall benefits wherewith hee hath crowned this unworthy Nation of ours, hee hath added this blessing of blessings, this King of favours to give us so cleare a revelation of the Doctrine of salvation by faith in Christ alone. Blessed bee his name, and let your hearts say <hi>Amen</hi> to this thanksgiving: and let it bee one part of your endeavour this day to give solemne praise every man apart, and his Familie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for this unspeakable mercie of his, in making you live in the dayes of Light, and in the bright Sun-shine of the Gospell: and you shall prove your selves to have begun to have <hi>kept Christs say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> if you be thankfull for his making of it knowne unto, and for writing of it in your hearts. This is the first Use.</p>
                  <p>Next, I beseech you let me take boldnesse to reprove (I feare) <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Reprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
                     <pb n="357" facs="tcp:14764:187"/>
a great number of you of a sinne whereof I will make it appeare you are guiltie. Men there are that make large promises to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that they shall never be damned, they shall not goe to Hell, they hope <hi>Death</hi> shall not have power to dragge them from this world to the place of darknesse.</p>
                  <p>Thou hopest so? Come, render a reason of thy hope. To hope without a ground, is to deceive ones selfe with extreame folly. As for example: there are a number of prisoners in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> or in some other Prison: should they hope for some man of great wealth to pay their debts, and save them from hanging: should they not be arrant fooles to hope, except they could shew some ground for their hope, and some evidence for their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of such a kindnesse? Thou that hopest, <hi>thou shalt never see Death;</hi> come answer God in thy conscience: dost thou <hi>keepe the saying of Christ or no?</hi> Where is the knowledge of the <hi>Doctrine of the Gospell?</hi> Doest thou beleeve that which concernes thee touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy miserie, and so apply that to thy selfe to make thee a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent sinner; Doest thou beleeve the Doctrine concerning the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie,</hi> and so apply that to thy selfe, to make thee perfect thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, by being not only grieved for sinne, but taking bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to confesse it, and aske pardon, and by framing thy selfe in thankfulnesse to amendment of life, and New obedience? Doest thou (I say) know this Doctrine, and so know it as to practise it? Hope and spare not; the more thou hopest, the better thy hope is; the stronger and surer it is, the more thou glorifiest God, and the more it shall comfort thee.</p>
                  <p>But oh unhappy man, if thou findest not in thy selfe the care and power in some measure to doe these things; cursed bee thy hopes, because they be disgracefull to Almighty God, tending to make him a lyar, and an unjust person; and because they are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to thy owne soule, tending to rocke thee asleepe in the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of security. Cursed be those unsound and sandy-built hopes of most men, that never yet applied themselves to confesse and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their sinnes; that never applied themselves to crave pardon, and to resolve upon amendment; that never studied to throw themselves into the Armes of Gods mercy in Christ for pardon; that never intended to <hi>mortifie the deedes of the body,</hi> and to subdue <hi>the flesh with the lusts thereof:</hi> and yet they hope they shall not bee damned; thou maist as well hope that the Divell shall come out of Hell into Heaven, as thou to goe out of earth in to Heaven. If thy hope be not grounded upon the workings of these graces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou findest thy selfe penitent; because thou findest thy selfe carefull to strive to rest wholly upon Christ for salvation; because thou findest thy selfe industrious in the studie of newnesse of life: except (I say) thy hope be thus grounded, it is the vainest thing
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:14764:188"/>
in the world, and it will never doe thee good at the last houre.</p>
                  <p>Brethren give me leave to tell you that there are two Gospells in the world: the Gospell of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of <hi>Beelzebub</hi> (as I may call it) the gospell of the Divell, that comes from Hell, and tendeth to bring men thither. Christs Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is, <hi>Repent and beleeve, and obey, and be saved.</hi> The Divels gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is: say you beleeve, make your selves imagine that you have faith, and then never care for repentance and obedience, and you shall be saved. Christs Gospell is summed up thus by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Returne to him and live.</hi> But the Divels goeth thus; Assure thy selfe thou shalt live, though thou care not for repentance. Oh let not the Divell beguile you with that false and counterfeit Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of his, whosoever leaneth to it, shall find it like the Authour of it, <hi>a Lyar;</hi> and when he hath trusted to it, that confidence and hope of his shall be as the Spiders web, the Beesome of destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall sweepe it and him downe to the depth of Hell: <hi>Death</hi> shall have dominion over him, and carry him from this present world to the region of darknesse, into eternall torment: hee shall <hi>see Death</hi> in the grimnesse and terriblenesse of it, he shall feele it in all the extremitie that the wrath of God can inflict upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of disobedience.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I have to command and require you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that you apply your selves to a thing ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Exhortation.</note> so much to the honour of him, and to the commoditie and comfort of your owne soules.</p>
                  <p>I have shewed you that Jesus Christ hath revealed a way how you should escape the danger of Death eternall, and the hurt of Death naturall. I beseech you now fall a doing one while, as you have beene busied in hearing. To what purpose is it that you flocke to heare Sermons, and throng to receive the Word, except you lay it up in your hearts, and apply your selves to practise? If thou hast not begun before, now begin: if thou hast begun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, now resolve to proceed with more life and courage: Either begin or persist in the practise of the <hi>Doctrine of the Gospell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If thou hast not repented, I require thee in the name of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, to make this houre the first beginning of thy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: and apply thy selfe to lay the foundation of that worke, before thou lay thy head to sleepe. Goe and call to minde thy sinnes, and make thy cheekes wet, at least thy heart heavy for the multitude of thy great offences: downe on thy knees in thy Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set; make thy confession of them to God, sigh for them, mourne for them, labour to weepe for them, afflict thy soule with great sorrow and remorse: then cry for pardon and remission: as the thiefe begs at the barre for mercie, so doe thou for the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of thy sinnes through Christ Jesus: and put upon thy selfe
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:14764:188"/>
a firme resolution, and stedfast purpose to goe on no more in the wayes of wickednesse, to practise grosse sinnes no more, nor no more to allow any sinne that thou knowest to be a sinne, though it be never so small.</p>
                  <p>Doe thus (my brethren) and then you may and will, (it will follow almost of it selfe) rest on Christ for salvation. Hee that so seeth his owne sinnes, as unfeignedly to lament for them, and to judge himselfe before God, (if hee apprehend the truth of the <hi>Doctrine of the Gospell,)</hi> he cannot for his life but come on amaine, and throw himselfe downe before Christ, to imbrace, and receive, and entertaine him, and lie in his Bosome.</p>
                  <p>And that man cannot for his life, when hee seeth the sweetnesse of the grace of God in Christ, but resolve to obey him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to walke in the wayes of holinesse, and take paines, and use industrie for the overcomming of all sinne: and by the vertue of Christ he shall prosper in this.</p>
                  <p>I beseech you therefore set your selves aworke about this great businesse, to get <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>New Obedience:</hi> it is much more needfull then sleepe, then meat, then attyre: there is nothing in the world so requisite for thy welfare as these things. Scrape thou riches together in the same quantitie that <hi>Solomon</hi> did, and ten thousand times more, yet thou shalt <hi>see Death</hi> once within a hundred, or halfe a hundred yeares. Get wisedome, yet thou shalt <hi>see Death</hi> after a few yeares. Take pleasure with as much greedinesse as he did once, when he forgate himselfe for a space, yet thou shalt <hi>see death.</hi> These things that the foolish world hunts after with so much earnestnesse of desire, will not secure thee from the sight of the <hi>King of feares, Death,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> calleth it. But if thou once get Faith, and Repentance, and new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then thou hast obtained that, that all the riches, and honour, and pleasures, and learning, or whatsoever seemeth desireable in the world, will not helpe their possessors to.</p>
                  <p>What will you doe? (brethren) Grovell still on the earth? and still be mad after backe and belly? Or will you now begin to thinke, I must die, I must shake hands with that dismall enemie, pale-faced Death, that is able to strike terrour into the strongest heart, and amazement into the stoutest soule that is not well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: and if this <hi>Death</hi> find mee destitute of true <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>New Obedience,</hi> it will seize upon me, and dragge me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgement seat of God, where I shall bee <hi>Henced</hi> away with a malediction and curse, and be forced to take my place with the Divell and his Angels in unquenchable flames? Oh what shall I doe then to secure my selfe from the great, from the strong, arme of death? I will repent, now I will begin, Lord draw mee, helpe me that I may doe it. I will beleeve now; Lord doe thou
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:14764:189"/>
worke Faith that requirest it. I will obey, Lord inable me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme such needfull duties as thou commandest me. Shall this be your practice when you come home? Will you thus studie to practise <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Obedience?</hi> and studie to cry and call for it, and use all your indeavour? Or what will you doe? will you be as idle and carelesse, as negligent and slothfull in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after these graces as before? Will you be as greedy of the transitorie vanities of this life, as in former times? Oh abuse not the word of God. If thou goe out of the Church without a full purpose to apply thy selfe from hence forward, either to begin, or to proceed in the practise of the <hi>saying of Christ;</hi> Cursed bee thou in thy hearing, cursed be that houre that thou hast spent, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be thy misbestowed labour thou dissembling hypocrite. But if thou labour to practise this of Christ, namely to <hi>keepe his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> the <hi>Doctrine of the Gospell,</hi> to repent, to beleeve, and to obey, blessed art thou in thy hearing, and in thy doing, and in thy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, happy is the time, and the place, and all things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre together to draw thee to so needfull a worke.</p>
                  <p>I pray <hi>(Brethren)</hi> set not your labour upon gold and silver, and money, and trash, not upon the pleasures and delights, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments of the world, not on any other thing; but mainly and principally above all things let your chiefe care bee for <hi>Faith, and Repentance, and Obedience.</hi> If you strive for these things earnestly, and heartily, and constantly, as sure as the Lord is in heaven, hee will bestow them upon you, and with them, the benefit of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, <hi>Freedome from Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now I shall speake comfort to those few that are in the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 4. Consolation.</note> world, that <hi>keepe these sayings of Christ.</hi> Let them bee of good comfort: if their capitall enemie the <hi>King of feares,</hi> and the King of Afflictions be held from a possibility of doing them harme, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can harmethem. Hee that <hi>Death</hi> cannot hurt, paine cannot hurt, povertie and disgrace cannot hurt, nothing can hurt him. You know if the King of an Armie be reconciled to a place, hee will keepe his Souldiers from spoyling, and burning, and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that place. If <hi>Death</hi> be put out of power to doe thee hurt, and God bee reconciled in Christ, because thou <hi>keepest the saying</hi> of Christ, nothing can hurt thee, thou art the happiest man under the Sunne. Why should the poore, sad, afflicted, grieved, mourning, lamenting Saints of God envie them that are rich, and jolly, and merry worldlings, any of their pleasures and profits? any of those things wherewith they like <hi>Idiots</hi> make themselves laugh at? What? hath not God given thee better things then hee, that thou shouldest murmure and whine, and weepe for want of them? art thou still complaining for want of them?</p>
                  <p>Remember what Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>Let the brother of low degree</hi>
                     <pb n="361" facs="tcp:14764:189"/>
(that is abased and despised in the world) <hi>rejoyce, yea, rejoyce with great boasting, and glory, in his Exaltation.</hi> This is the exaltation of the Saints, Christ writing his <hi>sayings</hi> in their hearts, and inclining them through the operation of his Spirit, and the powerful worke of his Word, to repent and beleeve, hath freed them from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Death, and interessed them into eternall happinesse, and that blisse that no tongue can expresse, nor no heart conceive. This is thy happinesse: it is not to be rich, or to be great, for these cannot deliver the owner from the hurt of Death naturall, nor from the danger of Death eternall. But to have <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Obedience:</hi> this is riches and exaltation; for he that hath them shall not alone escape the Dungeon of eternall darknesse, but bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Palace of everlasting felicitie. The Saint is the happy man: the penitent beleever, and true practiser of Christian obedience, he is the sole and only happy man under the Sunne: for whatsoever storme hee suffereth in this present world, hee shall certainly escape Death, and obtaine Glory. Blesse God, and blesse thy selfe in God, magnifie him, rejoyce in him, take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in thy lot and portion; <hi>Death</hi> that devoureth Kings, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth Emperours, that conquers Captaines, and men of valour shall not be able to approach thee for thy hurt, for thou <hi>keepest the saying of the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Rejoyce (I say) in this, magnifie him that is the Authour of it, and account thy selfe happy that thou hast received from him so excellent a gift, as to bee in some measure inabled to <hi>keepe his saying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, if it were so (may some Christian heart object) then I <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> should esteeme my selfe the happiest man alive: but alas, where is this <hi>Repentance</hi> you describe? where is this <hi>New Obedience</hi> in mee, that still, still, find my selfe captive and thrall to passion, to this, and that, and the other lust, and divers corruptions? Where is I say that <hi>Repentance,</hi> when I find so much sinne? Where is that <hi>Faith,</hi> when I find so much wavering and quaking, so much apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to distrust, and almost to dispaire?</p>
                  <p>Where is it? It may bee in thy heart for all thy complaining, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> and thou maiest have it for all these exclaymings against thy selfe. Tell mee, when thou findest those corruptions whereof, and for which thou speakest against thy selfe, Dost thou allow them or not? dost thou confesse them, and lament them or not? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse them indeed, but with such a small deale of sorrow. Is it such a sorrow as drawes thee to God? and drives thee out of thy selfe? such as makes thee to fall before him, and judge thy selfe worthy to be damned, and submit to his Justice? Is it such a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row as makes thee confesse, and then purpose amendment? Such as makes thee cry to him for power and strength? such as makes thee rest on him for abilitie? Dost thou determine still, still to
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:14764:190"/>
amend that that still troubleth thee? Dost thou still continue to fight with the lusts of thy flesh by the spirituall weapons that God hath ordained for thee? I say to thee, thy <hi>Repentance,</hi> thy <hi>Faith,</hi> thy <hi>New Obedience</hi> may be true, though it be weake. When a man hath a shaking Palsey hand, it is a hand. A sicke weake man that lies crying oh, oh, that can scarse turne himselfe betweene the sheetes, is a man, a living man. A poore child that is new borne, and hath nothing that discovereth reason almost, but the shape of a man; that poore child is a reasonable creature. <hi>Faith</hi> beginneth with weake apprehensions, and faint leanings on Christ. Deepe godly sorrow, and other parts of <hi>Repentance,</hi> may begin many times with little. And amendment of life begins sometimes at a low foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at small sinnes. If it bee true, and sincere, and constant: if thou goe on and continue in a course of daily renewing thy <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> and striving by Gods meanes to get the increase of these graces, and to bee upright and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in them: thou art blessed in them notwithstanding thy weaknesse: take comfort in a little, and be thankfull for it: God will give more, and the only way to get more, is to take comfort in a good measure in what thou hast: and the way to take comfort, is to labour to increase these graces.</p>
                  <p>Let not the weake, troubled, feebled Christian bee troubled in minde, as if hee had no grace, because hee hath but a little: as if hee did not at all keepe Christs sayings, because hee keepeth them but a little. Hee is a scholler in the Schoole that beginneth at Christ-Crosse-row (as wee call it.) And hee is entred into the Colledge, that beginneth but in a low booke, with the first rudiments of Logicke. And hee is a member of the Familie that began to bee an Apprentise but yesterday, and comes not to a deepe knowledge of his Art and Mysterie, but is glad to doe sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie worke.</p>
                  <p>Beleeve it (brethren) there may bee great conceits of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and beleeving, and obeying, that may make a man good in his owne eyes, and be altogether false. There may be a small measure of <hi>Repentance;</hi> but if one bee humbled in the smalnesse of that measure, and labour, and desire, and pray, and begge for the increase of that measure, and take paines to edifie himselfe in it, by the meanes of God: then it is true and upright, and shall save him. Therefore Rejoyce.</p>
                  <p>It is not with the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> as it was with that of Workes. The Covenant of Workes, the Law required per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Obedience to all the things prescribed: a man must not only love God, but love God perfectly. But the Gospell satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth it selfe with accepting truth of endeavour to the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. If there bee <hi>Repentance,</hi> though it bee not in the full
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:14764:190"/>
perfection: if thou <hi>beleeve,</hi> though not with the fullest measure of beleeving: If thou <hi>Obey,</hi> though not in the highest degree of obedience: this Gospell, this sweet, this favourable gracious Doctrine giveth thee consolation enough. Goe home therefore comforted in the beginnings, and resolved to proceed: and know that thou shalt enjoy that which Christ hath promised, freedome from damnation, <hi>thou shalt never see Death.</hi>

                        <p>Rejoyce, oh young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheare thee in the dayes of thy youth, and walke in the wayes of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into Iudgement.</p>

                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Olomon</hi> in the conclusion of this Chapter is <note place="margin">Coherence.</note> exhorting the sonnes of men to true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: and the better to mould and frame them to the same: hee mindeth them of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Iudgement:</hi> without which there cannot be planted in us a right care and feare of God. From the seventh verse to the latter end, hee hath to doe with two sorts of men. First with those that were glued to this life, and to the delights and pleasures there of: and he bringeth them in, speaking thus; <hi>Truly the light is sweet, and it is a pleasant thing to behold the Sunne,</hi> vers. 7. By light there wee are to understand the light of the Sunne shining on us, while wee enjoy this mortall life. This many men suppose to be a very pleasant thing, and they over-much content themselves in the same. These <hi>Solomon</hi> verse 8. refuteth by three Arguments; The first is this, that <hi>though a man live many yeares, yet let him remember the dayes of darknesse;</hi> that is, that a time of <hi>Death</hi> will come: a time when our Sunne will set, and our light will turne to darknesse; though wee
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:14764:193"/>
live never so long, never so sweetly, never so pleasantly, though we enjoy the light of the Sunne, yet wee should carefully remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that darknesse abideth us. Secondly, saith <hi>Solomon, those dayes are many.</hi> His Argument is thus much. Let a man consider with himselfe, though he live many yeares, yet notwithstanding the dayes and yeares of his life, cannot be compared with the daies and yeares of his <hi>Death:</hi> a man is many more yeares under the ground in the Grave, then above ground walking on the face of the earth. Thirdly, saith <hi>Solomon; All that commeth is vanitie.</hi> That is, if a man may enjoy the light of the Sunne, and the pleasures of this life, that makes his heart lightsome: yet <hi>all this is vanity;</hi> there is no full contentment in these things, but an emptinesse in them all, and no man knowes how soone hee may bee bereaved of them.</p>
                  <p>Now in the words we have read: <hi>Solomon</hi> hath to deale with the young man: and he is altogether given to jollitie and merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hee forgetteth God, and the dayes of darknesse, and his lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end. Well, <hi>Solomon</hi> giveth him the bridle (as it were) and suffereth him to follow his owne way by an Ironicall concession, or figurative speech: declaring not what young men ought to doe, but what their course is, and what commonly they doe. <hi>Rejoyce oh young man in thy youth, and let thy heart cheare thee in the dayes of thy youth, and walke in the wayes of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know this</hi> (there is the cooling-card) <hi>that for all these things God will bring thee into judgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the words we will consider two parts. <note place="margin">Division of the words.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, what young men doe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Medicine of God to heale young men of their default.</p>
                  <p>That that young men doe is this; They give over themselves <note place="margin">1. The sin of young men.</note> to an inordinate carnall <hi>joy.</hi> Thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> Joy is set out from the time of it: <hi>the dayes of their youth.</hi> From the cause of it, their <hi>hearts cheare them.</hi> From the kindes of it, they <hi>walke in the wayes of their hearts, and after the sight of their eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Medicine with which <hi>Solomon</hi> would heale young men of this inordinate carnall Joy, is this; <hi>Know</hi> (saith hee) <hi>that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. The Cure.</note> 
                     <hi>for all these things, God will bring thee into Iudgement:</hi> that is, It is a most divine and infallible truth, that every one should know and acknowledge, that whatsoever sinnes they commit in their youth, without repentance, they must undergoe the dreadfull <hi>Iudgement</hi> of God because of them.</p>
                  <p>Thus (as briefly as I can) I have opened the words unto you. Though I might insist on many doctrines, yet notwithstanding, I will only handle these two.</p>
                  <p>The first shall be that which ariseth from the first part of the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:14764:193"/>
Text; what young men doe; what their fault is. For (as I said) it is an Ironnicall concession, not declaring what young men should doe, but what they doe. The Doctrine is thus much.</p>
                  <p>That it is the sinne of young men to rejoyce inordinatly, and carnally, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Wee reade concerning the old world, that <hi>they were eating and drinking, and marrying, and giving in mariage:</hi> altogether sottish and sensuall, till the wrath of God came in the flood and swept them away. Now lest any should suppose that this were the fault of old age only, the Scripture sheweth, that <hi>all flesh had corrupted their</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>way before God,</hi> Gen. 6. 11.</p>
                  <p>Isa. 22. 14. <hi>Let us eate and drinke, for to morrow wee shall die.</hi> It is <note place="margin">Isa 22. 14.</note> thought by learned Divines, that this speech was not so much the language of Age, as of the youth in Israel.</p>
                  <p>Hence <hi>Solomon</hi> giveth a caveate to the young man, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 1. to bridle and restraine him from his jollitie and carnall mirth. <hi>Remember now thy Creatour in the dayes of thy youth, while the evill</hi>

And <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Exhort young men that they bee sober minded;</hi> that is, that <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 6.</note> they leave this drunkennesse of understanding, in being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with sensuall carnall objects and pleasures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iob</hi> (in the first Chapter of that booke) when the young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">Job 1.</note> his Sonnes and Daughters met together to feast, hee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid lest they should be misguided in this kind, therefore the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man in a godly care and thoughtfulnesse for their welfare, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to God, to make attonement for their sinne.</p>
                  <p>Let us a little consider the reasons of this Doctrine, whence it is, that young men should be so much misguided in their youth.</p>
                  <p>The first cause is, naturall corruption that they have drawne by <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</note> propagation from their Parents. A spirituall leprosie, and mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and disease, which as it prevaileth (for the most part) against age by covetousnesse, so it getteth ground of youth by sensualli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and voluptuousnesse. This dams up the eare against reproofe: this hardens the heart against instruction: and makes many young men the souldiers of Sathan in sinne.</p>
                  <p>Againe in the second place. Men in their youth forget the day <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Forgetfulness of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Deut. 32. 29.</note> of their reckoning and judgement: they are not mindfull of their latter end. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 22. <hi>Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end.</hi> This Precept is neglected both by youth and age: but especially by those of younger
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:14764:194"/>
yeares. For they feele their bloud runne warme in their veynes, and they are full of spirits and vigour, therefore they suppose that the Grave, and the <hi>house of darknesse</hi> is farre off from them.</p>
                  <p>Againe in the third place. Young men are not broken by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions: <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Freedome from crosses.</note> the fallow ground is not poughed up by the pressures of afflictions, which through the grace of God are great meanes to tame nature, and to subdue the pride of it, and to bring it to a right frame and temper. <hi>Before I was afflicted</hi> (saith <hi>David) I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stray.</hi> And <hi>Ephraim</hi> saith of himselfe, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. <hi>I was as a Bullocke accustomed to the yoke, thou chastisest mee; and I was chastised; I was</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>ashamed, because I bore the reproach of my youth.</hi> But young men are free from aches, and paines, and sicknesse, and sorrow, much more then old age: and this is the reason why they are more licentious.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, young men want true joy in God: therefore they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Want of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall joy.</note> themselves to carnall joy. For sure it is that a man cannot live without joy and contentment: if hee have it not <hi>from the Wells of salvation,</hi> hee will drinke it out of watery and slimie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Now because men in their youth cannot take in the spirituall joy of that cleare fountaine, therefore they drinke in the muddy waters of carnall joy.</p>
                  <p>The use of this point is in the first place an Admonition to all young men, to take notice of these maladies, and spirituall disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. For Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 1. To take notice of their carnall joy. Young mens rejoycing proved to be inordinate. 1 Because it is not placed there where it should be.</note> in themselves. The first degree of our healing, is to see that we are sicke: and till then, Christ Jesus the Physitian of our soules hath no commission to doe us good.</p>
                  <p>Let young men observe in themselves, first their carnall joy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> here sheweth that they rejoyce inordinatly.</p>
                  <p>This may appeare to them first; because they rejoyce not where they ought: they solace not themselves in God, in whom is the fountaine of joy, nor in Christ Jesus in whom is the spring of Joy; nor in the sacred Word, where there is the Cisterne of Joy. Even as a bone when it is out of joynt, out of its place, it must needs be a disordered bone; so the affections when they are misplaced, are disordered: and then our Joy, and any other affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are misplaced, when they are not set upon God and Christ. Now if young men would deale uprightly with themselves, they should perceive that for the most part in their jollity and merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they never thinke of God, or dreame of the world to come. Nay, the serious apprehension of God Almighty, would quench their joy, and make it altogether put out.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the carnalnesse of the joy of young men appeareth, <note place="margin">2. Because it is placed there where it should not be.</note> because they rejoyce where they ought not, in riot, in drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in surfeiting, in voluptuousnesse, many times in obscenity of words and phrases, in making jeasts of the word of God, in deriding their superiours behind their backes. As <hi>Solomon</hi> saith of
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:14764:194"/>
                     <hi>laughter thou art madde;</hi> so wee may say of this merriment, it is madde merriment: hee is a madde man that rejoyceth in that for which, except he betake himselfe to serious and bitter mourning, hee cannot be saved.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the inordinatnesse of the joy of young men may <note place="margin">3. Because it is excessive in lawfull things.</note> appeare in this, because they rejoyce excessively in lawfull things: for any joy when it is inordinate and excessive, it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. It is lawfull to rejoyce in recreations: a <hi>whetting is no letting</hi> (as the Proverbe goeth.) But for a man to let out himselfe to the hinderance of the service of God, to the disturbance of his duty to men, it is unlawfull. It is lawfull to delight in the blessings, and comforts of God, that hee affordeth us: wee reade of the Joy of harvest in <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. But for a man to delight in the gifts of God, more then in the giver, it is unlawfull. Now if young men exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themselves, they shall find their hearts mount not up to God in their joy and jollity, and that they are excessive in the joy of the creature, but altogether cold, without joy of the Creatour.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the carnalnesse of the Joy of young men may well <note place="margin">4. Because it terminates not in God.</note> appeare in this: because they terminate, and conclude not their joy in God. This followeth on the former: for it is impossible that what beginneth not in God, should end in God. Now when Joy beginneth in sinne, it cannot end in God, but in the Divell.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let young men take notice of themselves, how they <note place="margin">2. Of their walking after owne heart.</note> 
                     <hi>walke after their owne hearts.</hi> The heart that sayes; Come, put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way pensive thoughts: trouble not your selfe about the day of reckoning and Judgement: enjoy the time present: what need this strictnesse of conversation: zeale is but rashnesse; there is no need of it, take thy fill of pleasures: thou hast goods laid up for many yeares. Thus they judge, and thus they walke after their carnall heart. This heart is as no heart: as wee reade of <hi>Ephraim</hi> in <hi>Hosea</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Hosea 7.</note> 7. <hi>Hee was a silly dove that had no heart:</hi> Certainly the heart that doth not guide men in the right way, and direct men to the feare of God, it is no heart. For as the eye that will not lead us in the right way: that performes not its office, is no eye: so the heart that leadeth not men to God, and to goodnesse, it is like the heart of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> it is as no heart.</p>
                  <p>Againe in the third place. Let young men take notice of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <note place="margin">3. Of their walking after the sight of their eyes.</note> how they walke after <hi>the sight of their eyes.</hi> That is, they stand gazing on things temporall, and neglect things eternall: they see a beautie and lustre in these outward things, and perceive no glory and brightnesse in Christ Jesus, and in his precious ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, if we follow our owne heart, and our owne eyes it will be thus. We should rather labour with <hi>Iob, to make a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job 31. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>with our eyes.</hi> Oh how few young men are there that make a
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:14764:195"/>
bargaine and agreement with their eyes, that they shall not bee as open Casements to let sinne into the soule? Oh how few young men are there, that like <hi>Ieremy,</hi> have their eyes as <hi>fountaines of water to weepe day and night</hi> for the afflictions of the people of <note place="margin">Jer. 9.</note> God? Oh how few young men are there, that with <hi>Moses, have</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>an eye to the recompence of reward, that they may suffer affliction with the people of God, rather then to enjoy the pleasures of sinne for a season.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I beseech you take a survey of your selves in these things. These are the vices, and sinnes, and deformities of young men: to be seene and lamented by all those that hope to dwell in Gods holy Hill.</p>
                  <p>The second use of this point, is for exhortation to young men: <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. For Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 1. To aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don carnall joy.</note> they should labour to be reformed in their affections and hearts. And away, away with this carnall joy: wee ought to cast it out of us.</p>
                  <p>Carnall Joy: will you know what the event of it will bee? It will end in carnall sorrow, and without repentance in hell it selfe. <hi>Woe unto you</hi> (saith our Saviour Christ) <hi>that laugh now, you shall</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 6. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>weepe and mourne. The triumphing of the wicked</hi> (saith <hi>Zophar</hi> in <hi>Iob) is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment; though his</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job 20. 6, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>excellencie mount upto the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; yet hee shall perish as his owne dung, they which have seene him shall say where is hee? Hee shall fall away as a dreame, and shall not bee found; yea, hee shall bee chased away as a vision of the night.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Directions how to avoid carnall joy.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But not to give you this only in precept, but also to shew you how to reforme your selves in these vices, that <hi>Solomon</hi> specifieth to beare sway in young men: let mee lay you downe these few directions.</p>
                  <p>First, you must betake your selves to mourning for your sins; <note place="margin">1. To labour for sorrow for sinne.</note> as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>Bee afflicted, and weepe, and mourne, let your laughter bee turned into heavinesse.</hi> If we be not reconciled to God, if we have not assurance, that we are interested in Christ, there is no time for us to rejoyce, wee should rather betake our selves to bitter mourning: for the wrath of God is due unto us, and wee know not how soone it may fall upon us.</p>
                  <p>In the second place: Consider how vaine all things are in which <note place="margin">2. Consider the vanity of things. 1. Of humane wisedome.</note> youthfull persons rejoyce.</p>
                  <p>If young men rejoyce in humane wisedome and understanding, this is a vaine thing. For first it is gotten with a great deale of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and <hi>vexation of spirit:</hi> so saith <hi>Solomon Eccl. 1. 13. I gave my heart to seeke, and search out by wisedome, concerning all things that are done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 1. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>heaven, this sore travell hath God given to the sonnes of men to bee exercised therewith.</hi> And (verse 18.) <hi>in much wisedome is much griefe, and hee that increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorrow.</hi> God doth so punish the pride and boldnesse of the wit of men, even from the fall of our first Parents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="373" facs="tcp:14764:195"/>
Secondly, this humane wisedome it must needs be a vaine thing, for <hi>Eccles. 1. 15. that which is crooked cannot bee made straight, and that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 1. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>which is wanting cannot bee numbred,</hi> by humane wisedome. The meaning is this: that the naturall wisedome of man cannot supply the defects of nature which are innumerable: much lesse can it furnish the soule with grace or salvation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is but <hi>vexation of spirit. Solomon</hi> though he <hi>had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wisedome and understanding, and had experience more then all the Kings of Hierusalem that were before him, yet</hi> (saith he) <hi>Behold this is vexation of spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, God will abolish this humane wisedome, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 19. <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>I will destroy the wisedome of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? where is the Scribe? where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this world?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides, all your humane wisdome, it shall not goe downe to the Grave: it shall leave you when you die. <hi>There is no worke, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 9. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>nor knowledge, nor wisdome in the grave whither thou goest, Eccles.</hi> 9. 10. This is the first thing in which young men oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, they are prudent and wise: And you see that this is a vaine thing.</p>
                  <p>In the second place, if a young man rejoyce in his honour, and <note place="margin">2. Of wotldly honour and credit.</note> credit amongst men: this also is vaine. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath shewed it, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 2. 16. Hee declareth to us, that all the honour of the world will end in oblivion, <hi>there is</hi> (saith he) <hi>no remembrance of the wise,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 2. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>more then of the foole for ever: for that which now is, in the dayes to come shall bee forgotten, and how dieth the wise man? as the foole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, if a man rejoyce in honour, and much glory, hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beleeve: so saith Christ, <hi>Iohn 5. 44. How can you beleeve, since</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">John 5. 44.</note> 
                     <hi>you seeke honour one of another, and not the honour that commeth of God only?</hi> And it is noted to bee the reason why many of the <hi>chiefe Rulers that beleeved on Christ did not confesse him</hi> (without which <note place="margin">John 10: 43.</note> faith cannot be unfeigned) <hi>because they loved the praise of men, more then the praise of God,</hi> John 10. 43.</p>
                  <p>Nay further, the Apostle sheweth us that this is the cause of envie, <hi>Gal. 5. 26. Bee not desirous of vaine-glory, envying one another.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 26.</note> Envie is a vexing affection: this vaine-glory is the cause of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie: whereby we shall pine away, when we see the happinesse and welfare of our brethren.</p>
                  <p>Further, if young men delight in pleasures (which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">3. Of wordly pleasures. Eccles. 2. 1.</note> course of youth) these also are vaine things. <hi>I said in my heart</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccles. 2. 2.) <hi>Goe to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and behold this also is vanitie.</hi> Kings that have had the greatest wisedome to invent them: and the greatest leasure to use them: yet they never found full content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:14764:196"/>
in the same. <hi>I made mee</hi> (saith he vers. 4.) <hi>great workes, I buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Verse 4.</note> 
                     <hi>mee houses, I planted mee vineyards, I made mee gardens and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, and planted trees in them of all kinds of fruits, I made me pooles of water, I got mee servants and maidens; also I had great possessions of great and small cattell, above all that were in Ierusalem before mee; I got mee men-singers, and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musicall instruments of all sorts.</hi> Here were the pleasures of <hi>Solomon.</hi> But (verse 11.) <hi>Behold</hi> (saith hee) <hi>I looked on all the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Vers. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>workes that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to doe, and behold all was vanity, and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the Sunne.</hi> The wise <hi>Solomon</hi> that had beene trying every creature, whether it had any thing in it that might give him a true rellish, profest, that there was <hi>no profit under the Sunne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet further; these pleasures shall cease, there shall bee an end of them, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 29. The time is short, it remaineth that those that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>have wives, bee as though they had none; they that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not; they that buy, as though they possessed not: they that use the world, as not abusing of it, for the fashion of this world passeth away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, our Saviour Christ in <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 14. sheweth that the <note place="margin">Luk. 8. 14.</note> pleasures of this life choake the word of God, that it cannot bring forth gratefull fruit to God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if young men delight in riches, and rejoyce in their estates that God hath given them: this likewise is a vaine thing. <note place="margin">4 Of riches.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>For first, many times, wealth is gotten by deceit, and then God bloweth on it, <hi>Ier. 5. 27. As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit, therefore they are become great and waxen rich: shall not</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Je<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r. 5. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>I visit for these things, saith the Lord? and shall not my soule be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on such people as this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, wealth is kept with much sorrow, <hi>Eccles. 5. 12. The</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 5. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>sleepe of the labouring man is sweet, whether hee eate little or much, but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleepe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wealth is lost with a great deale of sorrow and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 18. when the <hi>smoake of Baby lon ascended up to heaven;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 18. 18.</note> Oh what lamentation there was! they cryed out, <hi>What city is like unto this great city? and they cast dust on their heads, and cryed, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and wayling, saying; Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich, all that had shippes in the sea, by reason of her costlinesse, for in one houre is shee made desolate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But suppose further, that a man should get, and keepe his wealth in the feare of God, yet these things are most uncertaine, as the Apostle saith, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 16. Charge them that are rich in this</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>world, that they trust not in uncertaine riches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, these riches cannot preserve our life: so saith Christ himselfe, <hi>Luke. 12. 25. Take heed and beware of Covetousnesse, for</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 25.</note>
                     <pb n="375" facs="tcp:14764:196"/>
                     <hi>no mans life is preserved by the abundance of that hee possesseth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the last place. If young men rejoyce in friends and Allies: <note place="margin">5. Of friends and Allies.</note> this also is a vaine thing.</p>
                  <p>For, <hi>Psal. 62. 9. The man of low degree is vanitie, and the man of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 62. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>high degree is a lie, to bee laid in the ballance, they are lighter then vanitie,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, no friend can deliver us from Death, <hi>Psal. 49. 7, 8. No man can by any meanes redeeme his brother, nor give to God a ransome for</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 49. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>him (for the redemption of their soule is precious, and it ceaseth for ever) that hee should still live for ever, and not see corruption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus I have shewed severall things that young men rejoyce in, and have shewed likewise that their joy is founded upon vanity, upon nothing. And this is the second meanes to heale young men of the inordinatenesse of their Joy, to meditate with themselves how vaine and frivolous all things are that they delight in.</p>
                  <p>The third meanes is, to betake themselves to seeke spirituall <note place="margin">3. Labour for spirituall joy.</note> joy. The well-head of this Joy is God: whom the Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the <hi>God of consolation.</hi> The instrument to convey this Joy, is Faith, <hi>Rom. 5. 1. Being justified by faith, wee have peace with God.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1.</note> The grounds of this Joy are twofold.</p>
                  <p>First, the good things exhibited. <note place="margin">A twofold ground of spirituall joy. 1. The good things exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the good things promised.</p>
                  <p>The good things exhibited; That God hath <hi>written our names in the booke of life.</hi> Here is the fountaine of spirituall joy to a true Christian; <hi>Rejoyce</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>not that the divels are fallen before you, but that your names are written in the booke of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the other ground of spirituall joy, is the good <note place="margin">2. The good things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</note> things promised us. And those may be reduced to two heads.</p>
                  <p>God hath made promises, either in regard of evill things (as wee call them) of afflictions that befall us. Or the weaknesse of the graces that are in us.</p>
                  <p>Now in the evill of Affliction, wee may rejoyce first; In the promise of protection in affliction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the promise of Edification, by affliction.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the promise of deliverance from affliction. All in the best season.</p>
                  <p>Againe, for the defects of grace in us (which indeed is a thing exceeding grievous to a true Christian.) Here wee may rejoyce. First;</p>
                  <p>In the promise of preserving of grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the promise of augmentation and growth in grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the promise of bringing the weastest grace to perfection.</p>
                  <p>Here you have the well-head of Joy. Oh that young men would know God, and Christ Jesus, and the word of God, and the promises, that they might leave this sinfull and sottish joy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:14764:197"/>
they are so adicted. This is the meanes to bee rid of it, by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into their soules, the sense and feeling of the true Joy of the children of God.</p>
                  <p>Againe in the second place; Young men should bee exhorted <note place="margin">The second Exhortation not to walke after their owne heart.</note> not to <hi>walke after their owne heart:</hi> which is the next thing that <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> noteth as a fault in them. <hi>The heart</hi> (saith <hi>Ieremy) is deceitfull above measure, and desperately wicked.</hi> It is so deceitfull, sucha Chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that we are not able to comprehend it: it is <hi>desperatly wicked.</hi> Who will follow a false guide? and a desperate wicked guide? so is the heart of man.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, they should not <hi>walke after the sight of their eyes. David</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The third Exhortation, not to walke after the sight of their eyes.</note> prayed; <hi>Turne away mine eyes that I regard not vanity, and quicken mee in thy Law.</hi> And againe: <hi>Open mine eyes, that I may see the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous things of thy Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is much danger in following our eyes. <hi>Eve</hi> was misled by her eye, shee looked upon the forbidden fruit, and saw it beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and so lusted after it. And, <hi>when I saw</hi> (saith <hi>Achan) among the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joshu. 7. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>spoiles a goodly Babylonish garment, and a wedge of gold, then I coveted them, and tooke them. David</hi> was defiled by the eye: <hi>Hee saw Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba from the roofe of his house washing her selfe,</hi> and then he lusted. <note place="margin">2 Sam. 11. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Holy men have prayed to God that hee would keepe their eyes in a right frame and temper. These are the particulars that <hi>Solomon</hi> giveth to young men in direction: to take heed of carnall joy: to take heed of walking after their hearts, or after their sense. And these things (brethren) I have now committed in direction to you.</p>
                  <p>The last use of this Doctrine is, for old men. For if young <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3. To old men.</note> men may not rejoyce carnally, much lesse may old men. Youth may plead for it selfe, in want of wisedome, and gravitie, sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and experience, better then those of age. If young men may not have evill hearts, and evill eyes, much lesse old men.</p>
                  <p>Looke to it, you that heare me this day, that are <hi>stricken in age,</hi> (as the Scripture speakes) that are smitten in your limmes with age, that you cannot walke with activity and nimblenesse: and are smitten in your senses with age, that you cannot well see, and heare, and taste. Oh that your hearts would smite you for your sinnes. May not young men rejoyce in pleasures, in friends, in honours, in wealth? Much lesse may those of old age. Must young men be carefull to chase away all carnall joy, and to get spirituall joy, that beginneth in godly sorrow? much more must old men. It is no time for those that are old to rejoyce in carnall things: a few daies will make an end of them, and lay them in the Grave. Oh then, you that are of yeares, <hi>breake off your sinnes by repentance, and your iniquities by mercy.</hi> Rejoyce in being good, and in doing good. This Joy will continue with you: as for the Joy
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:14764:197"/>
of <hi>corne, and wine, and oyle,</hi> and silver, and gold; this joy will die when you die. Yea, notwithstanding all the supports of this joy in this life, yet in another life you may bee transported to hellish torments. Thus much for this first.</p>
                  <p>In the second place; <hi>Solomon</hi> sheweth the remedie against this carnall Joy in young men: which also may bee a preservative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinne, both for young and old. <hi>But know thou</hi> (saith he) <hi>that for all these things God will bring thee to judgement.</hi> The Doctrine is thus much;</p>
                  <p>That the Lord God will certainly bring men to judgement for all the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. God will bring men to judgement for all their sinnes. Mala. 3. 18.</note> sinnes they have committed.</p>
                  <p>This is an infallible truth. <hi>Know thou this, that for all these things God will bring thee to judgement.</hi> Malach. 3. 18. <hi>A booke of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance is written before God, for those that feare the Lord, and thought upon his name.</hi> So the Lord hath a booke of remembrance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee writeth downe the sinnes of the sonnes of men; and this shall bee opened, and unclasped in the evill day, <hi>Eccles. 12. 14. God will bring every worke into judgement, with every secret thing,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccles 12. 14.</note>

                     <note place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>with a shout, with the voyce of the Archangell, and with the trump of God.</hi> Epistle of <hi>Iude,</hi> vers. 14. <hi>And Enoch the seventh from Adam,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Epist. Jude 14</note> 
                     <hi>prophesied of this, saying, the Lord commeth with ten thousands of his Saints, to execute Iudgement upon all, and to convince all that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly among them, of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For opening of this point, I will briefly shew you these two things.</p>
                  <p>First, what is the reason that God will bring all these things to Judgement.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what manner of Judgement it shall be.</p>
                  <p>For the first. What is the reason that God will bring all these <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because of Gods decree. Heb. 9. 27.</note> things to Judgement. The first reason is. His Decree, <hi>Heb. 9. 27. It is appointed to all men once to die, and after this the Iudgement.</hi> Even as it must needs be that men must die, because God hath so appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it: so also it must needs be that men must come to Judgement, in regard of the purpose and decree of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God will doe this in regard of his righteousnesse. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because of his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> Hee is a holy God, a hater of iniquitie. But many times in this world it is well with the wicked, and ill with the godly. <hi>Lazarus</hi> hee is in wofull miserie, and <hi>Dives</hi> hee is in abundance of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie:
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:14764:198"/>
Now God will shew his love to the righteous, and his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to the wicked in this Judgement. <hi>If judgement here begin at the house of God;</hi> It is impossible the familie of Sathan should escape hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God will by this meanes cleare his wayes, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Because of clearing his wayes before all, men and Angels.</note> speakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5. There are many wayes of God that are darke and cloudie to us, but then God will manifest himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men and Angels. Then those wayes and workes of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which the hearts of unsanctified men have boyled, shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be as they are, holy, and good, and righteous, to their condemnation and terrour.</p>
                  <p>Yet further; The particular Judgement that God inflicts upon <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Because of his hatred against sinne decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this life.</note> men in this life, may prove the universall. The burning of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah:</hi> the drowning of the old World: the plaguing of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the desolation of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> These shew the infinite hatred of God against sinne: therefore no doubt hee will take a time to revenge himselfe of the impenitent amongst the sonnes of men, because of their sinnes.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the consciences of men may prove that there shall bee <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. Because of the horrour that is in the consciences of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</note> a Judgement. For let a man commit secret sinnes, thatnone know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but God and hee, yet many times, hee feeleth hellish horrour: which is a manifest proofe, that conscience seeth, and apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God as the supreame Judge, that will call all men to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for their sinnes. Thus you heare the reasons why there must be a Judgement.</p>
                  <p>The manner of this Judgement consisteth in these particulars. <note place="margin">The manner of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, it shall bee the <hi>last judgement,</hi> after which there shall bee no other: which declareth the terriblenesse of it. In this life, <note place="margin">1. It shall be the last judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> while there is life, there is hope: <hi>Let the wicked forsake his wayes, and turne to the Lord, hee will be gracious to him.</hi> But then the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence shall not be reverst: then there can be no appeale from that Judge, and judgement.</p>
                  <p>Againe it shall bee a <hi>Generall Iudgement,</hi> which is the second <note place="margin">2. It shall be a Generall judgement.</note> thing. God judgeth in this world, and that both in life and in death: Hee judgeth in life, by chastising his children for their faults, and avenging himselfe upon his enemies. Hee judgeth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man at death, But then there shall be a Generall Judgement of all, 2 <hi>Cor. 10. Wee must all appeare before the Iudgement seat of Christ.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 10.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the third place. It shall be a <hi>manifest Iudgement.</hi> Sometime <note place="margin">3. It shall be a manifest judgement.</note> the Lord judgeth men secretly, by raising up in them feares and horrours in their hearts: causing his curse in them as water in their bowels, and oyle in their bones. But then God shall open his wrath against the children of wrath, before a world of men, and no eye shall pitty them. <note place="margin">4. It shall be a sudden judgement.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it shall bee a <hi>sudden judgement.</hi> Even as the flood
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:14764:198"/>
came upon the old World, when they were sporting themselves, and deryding <hi>Noah</hi> that preached to them of the flood: so shall the fire come upon the World, that shall passe before the face of Christ, when he shall judge the quicke and the dead. <hi>As a snare</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>shall it come upon all that dwell upon the earth.</hi> When the Fowler layeth a snare to take a Bird, hee giveth not warning to the Bird, but surprizeth it suddenly; so will Christ Jesus, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the sonnes of men, suddenly beyond their expectation. The Evangelist saith, <hi>hee shall come as a theefe in the night.</hi> A theefe knocks not, he giveth not warning: so Christ Jesus, beyond the thoughts of men, will bee on them suddenly before they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, by his dreadfull Judgement.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it shall be a most <hi>righteous judgement. Then God</hi> (as the <note place="margin">5 It shall be a righteous judgement. Rom. 2. 5.</note> Apostle faith <hi>Rom. 2.) will render to every man according to his deedes.</hi> Hee will not regard the face of any: Hee will not bee brybed by wealth or reward: Hee will not heare the testimony of the world for the wicked, or against the godly, but deale impartially, and give to every one according to his doings.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, It shall be an <hi>Eternall judgement.</hi> So saith the Apostle, <note place="margin">6. It shall be an eternall Judgement.</note> 
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. The meaning is not, that God shall sit for ever, sifting matters, and surveying causes: but it is so called from the effect: for the conclusion shall be this, the Eternall weale and happinesse of the godly, and the eternall woe and miserie of the wicked, that shall be plunged by the justice of God into the severest torments.</p>
                  <p>The Use of this Doctrine. First, it serveth as a preservative <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. A preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive against tentation.</note> against temptation: for so <hi>Solomon</hi> hath made it in the Text, a preservative and bridle to young men: <hi>God will bring thee to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> saith he: and let me make it so to you. When Sathan temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth you to sinne, remember, God will call you to Judgement, even for those faults, for which you may possibly escape the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie of men, yet notwithstanding it is impossible for you to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide the righteous Judgement of God. If Sathan would have thee doe any thing, that the word of God, and thy owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sheweth thee to be hatefull, and wicked in the sight of God: say to him, No, no, God will bring me to Judgement. This is the policie of our Adversarie, when hee induceth us to evill, hee makes sinne sweet and pleasant to us: but it should bee our wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to make sinne bitter and loathsome, even in this meditation, <hi>God will bring us to Iudgement</hi> for the same.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle saith, <hi>Resist the divell, and hee will flie from you.</hi> But how must we resist him? not by arguments of our owne making, but by arguments of the word of God: and amongst other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, remember to lift up this: when Sathan would have thee sinne, say, No, no, <hi>God will bring mee to judgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Divell solicited <hi>Eve,</hi> and circumvented her: shee
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:14764:199"/>
spake (in the Serpent) to <hi>Sathan</hi> concerning the Judgement of God: <hi>Wee may eate</hi> (saith shee) <hi>of all the trees of the Garden, but not of the tree in the middest of the Garden least wee die:</hi> here shee brought an argument from the judgement of God: but here was her weaknesse, shee presently let it fall. It should bee otherwise with us, when Sathan tempts us: let us say, we shall die, and be condemned for sinne: say so, and continue in it. If any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from the truth he professeth, he shall die in his sinne. If any man disquiet the people of God, by vexation, or oppression, hee shall die in his sinne. If any man bee a drunkard or Epicure, hee shall die in his sinne. If any man be a whoremonger or adulterer, hee shall die in his sinne. If any man bee a swearer, God hath vowed <hi>hee will not hold him guiltlesse,</hi> hee shall die in his sinne. If any man be an ignorant person, disobeying godlinesse, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unrighteousnesse, he shall die in his sinne. If any man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in grosse wickednesse, in any wickednesse, without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trnce, he shall die in his sinne. Oh remember this Judgement of God, this death that God will inflict on sinners for sinne: <hi>For the wages of sinne is death:</hi> and arme your selves with this when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than tempteth you: if you forget Death and Judgement, you are naked, and unarmed, your spirituall Adversary, may hit you on the bare, and spoile you as he will.</p>
                  <p>The second use, is for instruction. Will God bring us to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. For instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> for our sinnes. Oh then let us hast to repentance. Beloved, this is one of the last things that God will doe: and this is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test thing that Ministers can say: God will judge you for your sinnes. The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> he moveth the <hi>Athenians (Acts</hi> 17. 31.) to repentance upon this very ground, <hi>because God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a day in which hee will Iudge the world in righteousnesse.</hi> And <note place="margin">Acts 17. 31.</note> surely if this will not awaken us, nothing will, nothing can. What doe we meane (beloved) to suffer our sinnes to stand upon the score? Where is our wisedome? Our grace? <hi>Are wee able to stand before God, when hee is angrie with us?</hi> Why doe we not take off our sinnes by godly sorrow? If a Judge should say to a Malefactour, except thou mourne for thy offence thou shalt die, and bee execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Doe we not thinke hee would mourne to save his life? Behold God saith to you, except you mourne for your iniquities, you shall die in your sinnes. Oh why doe not wee make our eyes as fountaines to bewayle our sinnes? that man is possest with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame hardnesse that lamenteth not his iniquitie, <hi>and hee treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth up unto himselfe, wrath against the day of wrath, and the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the righteous judgement of God.</hi> Well, if wee will not mourne for our sinnes here to repentance, wee shall mourne hereafter in hellish horrour, without hope of helpe or mercie.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, this Doctrine that God will Judge us, should <note place="margin">Vse 3.</note>
                     <pb n="381" facs="tcp:14764:199"/>
make us preserve in ourselves a good conscience. It is the very <note place="margin">Keep a good conscience.</note> use that the Apostle makes, <hi>Acts 24. 15, 16. Hee had hope that there should be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust, therefore hee did exercise himselfe to have alwayes a good conscience voyde of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence toward God, and toward men. Blessed</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>are those that are pure in heart.</hi> There is nothing that will bee so rewarded, and so regarded at the last day as a good conscience. But for those that have stayned their consciences with all wickednesse and sin, and have not washed their consciences with the bloud of Christ, and the teares of true repentance, these shall have their portion without amongst those that are uncleane.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, this Doctrine should teach us to feare God, and to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 5. To feare God.</note> give glory to him. As Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> speakes in the Revelation, the day of his Judgement is comming, therefore feare him, and give glory to him. If the particular judgements of God that light upon men in this life should make us reverence his holy Name, how much more should this last Judgement that is so terrible, and unavoidable.</p>

                        <p>I am a stranger, and sojourner among you: give me a possession of a bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is the conclusion of all flesh: they were never so deare before, but they come to be as loathsome and intollerable now. When once the lynes and picture of Death is drawne over the Fabrique of Man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans body (as it is said here of <hi>Sarah)</hi> all their glory ceaseth, all their good respect vanisheth away, their best friends would be faynest ridde of them: even <hi>Sarah</hi> that was so goodly and amiable in <hi>Abrahams</hi> sight, must now out of his sight, he must <hi>bury his dead out of his sight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh the strange misery that sinne hath brought us to, when it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volveth, and throweth downe all our glory at once: and the ruffe of man-kind in their chiefest pride, in their greatest jollitie, all is tumbled in an instant, in a moment to basenesse, and stinke, and miserie!</p>
                  <p>How should wee be diligent to get the hope of a better life, seeing this is so little worth having? And how should our thoughts alwayes flie up to God, since there is nothing but rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and putrifaction found here in the world?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:14764:202"/>
But <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Father of faithfull men, and a patterne to all loving Husbands in all ages insuing, doth not this till such time as the dead <hi>Sarah</hi> groweth noysome to all that looke upon her. As long as he could by his mourning and lamentation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute her without offence to his eyes, and danger to his health, he did it: but now the time is come, when earth must bee put to earth, and dust must returne to dust. There is no place for the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest beauty above ground, when once God hath taken life and breath from it: it must goe to its owne elements, and to the rocke and pit from whence it was hewen, thither it must returne.</p>
                  <p>This holy man therefore being well resolved of this, and knowing the doome already uttered by God upon out first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <hi>Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt returne;</hi> hee cannot keepe his dead longer by him; hee knoweth the bed wherein now shee must be layed, therefore he seekes for it to these Countrey-men that he lived withall, that were Heathens and Pagans, but very morall and civill men, as wee may see in this whole Discourse. And he desireth them that he might have a place for his owne use and turne: not intimating so much to them, as that there should be a separation in their very death from Pagans and Heathens, but he keepeth that to himselfe, and covereth it with smooth speech, and elegancie of language, as his manner was. For indeed it was not lawfull for <hi>Abraham to bury his dead</hi> amongst the <hi>Cananites,</hi> the sonnes of <hi>Heth,</hi> of whom he demanded this peculiar favour at this time: but God would have his children, as they differ in all their life from Heathens that know no God, so they should dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in every point, even in their Graves after death, that there might bee no commixtion, and mingling of light and darknesse, and no fellowship betweene Christ and <hi>Belial.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to continue this hope, and confirme it in all his Posteritie, that were a peculiar and chosen people; It was necessarie hee should chuse his Grave, his place of Sepulture, that they might be sequestred from them in their death, as they were in the course of their life.</p>
                  <p>Now after he had performed that dutie that every man oweth to his dead friend, especially to his Wife, the mate of his bosome; he commeth to move this to the sonnes of <hi>Heth,</hi> that were Lords of the soile. Hee was abundant in teares before hee comes to move it: for God which commandeth us not to lament for the Dead, as men without hope, doth notwithstanding not forbid us to mourne, and sorrow for them, and to lament: hee giveth us leave; nay, he rather alloweth and approveth of naturall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when <hi>wee weepe with them that weepe, and mourne with them that mourne, and rejoyce with them that rejoyce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> knew well in what estate his Wife was, he knew shee
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:14764:202"/>
was in a happy condition, hee knew shee was the Mother of the Faithfull, and was translated to the heavenly Paradise: and hee was not angrie with God for taking away his Wife, he disdained not the act of his providence; notwithstanding he resolveth into teares and laments. And these may well stand together, if they be not (as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> saith) rebellious teares against God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst hope, and against the faith of the Resurrection: they are qualified and allowed, and accepted with the Lord, as a testimonie of that good affection, and brotherly love that he commandeth to be in every one.</p>
                  <p>After he had performed this, perhaps mourned three or foure dayes for his wife, he knew this mourning must have an end, he knew that he must commit her to the ground, and make away with her, that she might not be a means further to continue, &amp; aggravate his sorrow to no purpose: for with that condition a man is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the use of affections, as that he respect the glory of God, and give way to weake nature, rather then to any indulgent affection that is too head-strong and unruly, as though there were no hope in the promise of the Almightie. Therefore (I say) when he had thus moderated himselfe, as first to shew by his sorrow that he was a loving husband, and then to shew in the ceasing of his sorrow that he was a wise man, and a faithfull Christian, he commeth now to the chiefe and maine point, whereby to make an end of his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and take away the cause of further griefe, <hi>the sight of his dead.</hi> Hee commeth to desire a possession of buriall: and because hee was a stranger here, he commeth to those that were Lords, chiefe ones, and desireth them to intercede for him to the chiefe Lord, to bargaine with him for a place that hee had sought out, and as it seemeth (by Gods direction too) chosen. But I will goe no further then the Text.</p>
                  <p>Wherein first consider a certaine preamble that the holy man useth to the people that he now converst with, in these words. <hi>I am a stranger, and a sojourner among you.</hi> Wherein the sweetnesse of his nature doth shew it selfe, that he was both humble-minded, to know and confesse that he was a stranger, and also that hee was full of reverence and respect to those that he dwelt with: <hi>I am a stranger among you;</hi> You are the Lords, I a poore tenant; You the Masters of the soile, I but an Inmate, that came in and was first lodged by you, and with your consent; and without your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent I will not attempt any thing. That is the premonition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee insinuateth into their affections, and makes way for his speech and petition that after hee was to propound and tender to them.</p>
                  <p>And then the Petition followeth, <hi>Give me,</hi> because I will not take it of my owne head: <hi>Give me,</hi> What? <hi>A possession,</hi> such a thing
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:14764:203"/>
as I may call my owne, as I may have to my owne use, sequestred from all other mens: And <hi>Give it mee;</hi> not upon gift meerely, but for my money, give it me for price: answer me what I shall pay, that I may acquire and make this purchase.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for what hee would have this possession: To burie his Wife, and himselfe, and his posteritie; A burying place for them. A strange thing; a strange purchase for a man, to purchase no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground, but to buy land for a burying place.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, whom he would burie there, <hi>my dead.</hi> Hee calleth her not his Wife, but his Dead; because now the contract was ended by Death, and she was no more his Wife, but one of his loving friends. Buriall care after Death, it is committed to men by God, and by the voyce of Nature, therefore <hi>give mee a place to burie my dead out of my sight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It grieved him to see that beauty turned to pale blacke dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that now had over-faced the face of that beautifull woman: to see that sweet composed body that was the mirrour of the times; and the miracle of women in those ages, that it was now subject to rottennesse and putrefaction, and did now grow noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, that it made men flie from it, that they could not looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. <hi>That I may bury my dead out of my sight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These are the branches of my Text.</p>
                  <p>First, concerning the humble preface that <hi>Abraham</hi> makes, <hi>I am a stranger and a sojourner among you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A marvellous thing to consider the great faith of our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and patience that he used in the apprehension of Gods promise: for all this land was <hi>Abrahams</hi> land, yet hee confest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a stranger: and Saint <hi>Steven</hi> saith in <hi>Acts 7. that hee had not one foot of ground;</hi> not a foot in all the land that he could owne.</p>
                  <p>This is that wherein God is most glorious in his Saints their expectation, their patient expectation of Gods promises: that they thinke themselves as well for the time to come, for that which shall come, as if they were in present possession.</p>
                  <p>When the Lord brought <hi>Abraham</hi> out of his native Countrey, out of <hi>Ur</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> from the furthest part of <hi>Syria,</hi> hee brought him many hundred miles to an unknowne Land, and he promised to give him that Land, and to his seed after him: who would have thought but he meant to give him personall possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? But no, as soone as he was there, the Lord drives him out by famine into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and then hee understood that Gods mind was not to give it him; but when the sinnes of the <hi>Amorites</hi> were ripe, and the people of <hi>Israell</hi> were growne to a number, that they might come by some claime and right, and be such a multitude as should not be contemned, that they might not come by way of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to take possession, then God purposed to give it him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="389" facs="tcp:14764:203"/>
So that this thing we may learne hence, that God is infinitely gracious to his children, when they are content with the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of things to come, aswell as if they had present possession. This is that which the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> frequently speakes of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. that the Fathers had regard to the promises, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted upon God, that that should be truly performed that was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to them, and therein they rested themselves, and were aswell contented with the good word of God for the future times, for their posterities, as if they had it performed in their owne persons.</p>

                  <p>Here are two words, the one, <hi>(A sojourner,)</hi> signifieth, hee that passeth by, as those that come to see divers Countreys and stay not, but are making homewards: the other <hi>(A stranger,)</hi> signifieth, one that sitteth by in a place. <hi>Abraham</hi> was both of them; for when God commanded him, he was ready at any time to dislodge and goe his way: as long as he found the mercie of God to him; that is, as long as there was peace, and plentie in the land, hee rested there in that place in his Calling. God appointed him to sit there, and there he sate, but not as heire of the ground, as a Lord, but as one that did sit there by favour, as enjoying a peece of ground for his cattell to feed upon (for the Land was not full, but they might afford some roome to strangers) such was he, ready to flie when God called him. Therefore when God called him to <hi>Egypt,</hi> he presently changed the place, and went to that: and from thence when God called him againe, he came to <hi>Mamre,</hi> and there he dwelt with the Inhabitants of the Land, because hee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that that was the place that God had selected for him to make his possession.</p>
                  <p>It teacheth us to learne this voyce of our Father <hi>Abraham;</hi> as children learne to speake by their Parents, and delight in their language: so we should still delight our selves in this language of the Father of the faithfull, to be, and account our selves <hi>strangers and sojourners among you</hi> that bee the world, <hi>among you</hi> that have your cares so fixed on the world, that you have no care of heaven: <hi>among you</hi> that will give nothing, but hoard up riches, and you know not to whom you shall leave them: <hi>among you</hi> that have no dwelling above in that Citie, <hi>whose builder and maker is God: among you</hi> that live only on earth, <hi>I am a stranger among you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And being so (as every Christian must professe himselfe) it therefore followeth, we must abstaine from all fleshly lusts, and worldly desires, and carnall concupiscences and appetites: for <hi>strangers</hi> use not to settle on their dregs in the Countrey they passe thorow, but as men in motion, they take that which is needfull,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:14764:204"/>
knowing that they have a Countrey in another place, the blessed <hi>Ierusalem that is from above, who is the mother of us all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, we are to consider here the humble conclusion that <hi>Abraham</hi> makes out of his pilgrimage, out of his strangenesse: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was a <hi>stranger;</hi> therefore he will be no meddler, as it is an old rule, strangers must be no meddlers, they must not take what they will, not buy what they will, <hi>strangers</hi> doe not purchase land in a strange Countrey, without the good will of the Natives. Such was the nature of this holy man of God, hee would not so much as make bold with them for a burying place without their consent. One would thinke it had beene easie for him to have ventured upon this: whensoever a man dies, the common custome of nature, and the law of Nations yeeldeth this priviledge to put their dead into the ground, earth to earth: there is none so barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as to denie, by the light of nature, but that a dead man should be buried, <hi>strangers,</hi> or Forreiners, or native Inhabitants: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I say a man would thinke that such a man as <hi>Abraham</hi> might safely have ventured upon this to bury <hi>Sarah,</hi> and never told them, and asked their good will. But no, the blessed man was of another mettall, of a heavenly and sweet disposition, hee would trouble no man, he would give no offence, but carry himselfe as an Angell of God among them, harmlesse to every one, he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth every mans love, he was carefull to avoid any mans desplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: and therefore he commeth to them as to great men, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth them, as if it had beene for a Lordship, or a peece of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or some great matter of estate: he commeth to beg a Grave, he desireth a burying place.</p>
                  <p>This should teach us what ought to bee our condition in this world, not to be audacious and bold, and presumptuous, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly we are one upon another. And even <hi>strangers</hi> themselves so forget themselves now adayes, that they make no conscience of depraving, and undermining, and spoyling, and putting Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives out of their possession: they get to themselves such an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie, as is strange, and none of the least reproaches, they neither approve themselves to God nor men by this bold intrusion. Let <hi>strangers</hi> be like themselves, to know that nothing is theirs that they can challenge, they must come to it by the good will, and consent of the parties, for <hi>strangers</hi> are not at home, but to be sent home to their owne place, they must presume of nothing out of their place.</p>
                  <p>If men did consider this, they would not shoulder out and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure and backbite one another, and all for base worldly pelfe, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better then a burying place, then a Rodde of ground to make them a Grave: but men are so set on it, as though all their hope were here, as though they had no treasure in another place, as
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:14764:204"/>
though this were their home, and they had no further motion to better things. This is the Preface.</p>
                  <p>Now the Petition followes. <hi>Give me I pray you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Giveme,</hi> not <hi>Gratis;</hi> the meaning is not (as after the storie shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) he would not take it for nothing, but give mee for price, for reasonable bargaine, as you shall deeme it fit to give me. See here againe the excellent moderation of this great man, this great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God: hee confest it lay in their power to assigne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with him for any thing: it must be their gift, or else he would venture upon nothing: I have lived among you, and I would faine die among you too; as you have given me leave to live with you, I beseech you cast not a way my dead: my Wife is gone the way of all flesh, and I shall follow her shortly, cast us not away: there is no further corporall living for us together; I beseech you <hi>give mee a burying place,</hi> and then we shall be one corporation, our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes will moulder to nothing, and not hurt you; therefore <hi>give mee,</hi> that which is a common gift, a gift that enemies will give to enemies, and therefore a gift to <hi>strangers,</hi> and it is naturall to doe good to <hi>strangers. I beseech you give me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is this hee would have? For though this people were very liberall, and would have given him a hundred times more then this hee requested, as wee see afterward by their answer: it would have beene a great matter that <hi>Abraham</hi> should have beene denyed: yet this holy man asketh such a gift, as they might well grant without harme.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the holy man is to be commended; as for the great beggars of the world, they cry, <hi>Give, give;</hi> all the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is not sufficient to satisfie their desire, but still when they have had this, and that preferment, they cry still <hi>Give.</hi> This blesfed man was of more moderation, hee had a more circumcised heart and desire: hee desireth no more then they might well forbeare, and part with, and suffer him to have without hindrance.</p>
                  <p>And so it teacheth men their dutie, that they should not too much grate upon a friend, nor too impudently demand things that cannot well be parted with: many men are of such good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that they will give away at the first sight of a Petition, that that shall bee a great losse, and damage to them, and after wish that they had not given it, when they cannot recover it againe. There was no such spirit in <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor should be in Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they should not bee insatiable, and extend themselves to unreasonable demands: a thing that argueth one altogether glued to this world, and one that hath no further expectation then of things below.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Give me:</hi> What? <hi>A possession of buiall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>A Possesson.</hi> Hee would have it so conveyed, as no man
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:14764:205"/>
might make claime of it, but that it should be for him, and his for ever. Therefore it was, as it were, a Church-yard that he begged, such a one as was capable, and had sufficient scope and roome for his whole Posteritie in the time to come, in times of trouble and persecution: for in this place were the Fathers and those Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches (though we reade not of their Buriall in this place in the booke of God many of them, yet notwithstanding it is likely that all the Patriarches had their bodies) conveyed to this place, and that the great ones in <hi>Egypt</hi> that so demeaned themselves, that they had favour from the Court, were brought to this place. For these and himselfe, and his present Familie about him, whom it might please God to strike with Death he knew not how soone, the holy Father desired a place separate, that there might bee no mingling of the select people of God with those <hi>that were without God in the present world,</hi> as the Apostle saith.</p>
                  <p>Now for this, there is no distinction in our time, for Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made the <hi>Corner stone,</hi> hath made both walls one, the Jewes and Gentiles being built upon himselfe, all this difference is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: But at that time it was fit to maintaine a distinction, to keepe a note of difference. As God set a marke upon the flesh of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and upon the houses of the Isralites in <hi>Egypt,</hi> so they kept this in all points, even in their very Graves, that a difference might be maintained betweene the seed of the Woman, and the seed of the Serpent to the uttermost.</p>
                  <q>Give mee a possession, a burying place.</q>
                  <p>Here is the end why he would have this <hi>Possession.</hi> A strange kind of <hi>Possession:</hi> a thing that every one is borne to, no man will denie this: we say the land in the Church-yard is every mans, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is borne to that land. Behold such a land, such an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance this Father commeth to begge. He hath not a foot of ground in all the whole land, no place to dwell in, but by their leaves; no place to feed on but with their consent; he is content thus to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse, to have it upon their hand; to haue his house upon their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and his field and grasse upon their affection, and content to be gone, and depart upon their bidding: but when it commeth that his dead must be buryed, there is no dislodging then, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving then, that is a <hi>Possession,</hi> he makes not other things his <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,</hi> but useth them in a transitorie manner.</p>
                  <p>So that the holy Ghost would teach us this, that a mans Grave is his strong hold, his <hi>Possession.</hi> And indeed there is no <hi>Possession</hi> so durable and certaine as the Grave: all the lands, and all the meanes that a man hath in this world, it may in the course of time, either by the misguidance of the partie, or the succession of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalls
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:14764:205"/>
be made away, that he that hath had full possessions may not have a foot of land to call his owne: so <hi>Possessions</hi> are alterable, sometime one mans, sometimes anothers, and againe anothers, no man knoweth whose, because they are still removing. But when a man is possest of his Grave, that is a long <hi>Possession,</hi> that Lease is time out of mind, and it holdeth to the comming of Christ to Judgement.</p>
                  <p>Though there be a sort of covetous men in the world that care not for lucre and gaine to remove dead bodies, to make men pay deafe, and yet presently when the memory of that payment is gone (in this base respect) to remove them from their naturall rest, and to put new bodies in their roome. Though this (I say) be practised by some, yet notwithstanding the Lord hath ordered this that a man should have his Grave for ever; and that all Christian men should know that they have no such true inherent <hi>possession,</hi> sticking to them, and they to it, as the Grave. Thus the great God bringeth us to life by death, making us possesse the Grave here for a time, and after possesseth us with life and glory, and joy in the highest heavens.</p>
                  <p>Behold <hi>Abraham:</hi> see how he beginneth to possesse the world, by no land, pasture, or earable Lordship: the first thing is a Grave. So every Christian must make his resolution. The first houshold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuffe that ever <hi>Seleucus</hi> bought in <hi>Babylon</hi> was a Sepulchre stone, a stone to lay upon him when hee was dead; that he kept in his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. So we should begin to make that our chiefe utensill: it should teach every Christian much more to be mortified so to the world, as to bee settled upon nothing for a <hi>Possession,</hi> so as the ground where his flesh shall rest in hope, till the Lord revive him, and give him his Spirit againe.</p>
                  <p>A strong kind of entrance this holy man made into the holy Land, that the first thing hee takes <hi>possession</hi> of, should bee a place of buriall for the dead. Even so wondrously God useth to worke: the promised seed it came of the dead wombe of <hi>Sarah:</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it is in this great and famous Historie, that out of these dead ones, the Lord takes such a firme possession of this Land, that when foure hundred yeares were come about, there was such a quicke issue, that it drove all the Inhabitants out of the Land: for out of <hi>Sarah</hi> that was now dead, and <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches that were interred in his Cave, out of their dead loynes the Lord raised a living issue of six hundred thousand footmen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides women and children that came under the conduct of <hi>Ioshua</hi> and discomfited the Captaines of the Land <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>d tooke possession.</p>
                  <p>The gracious God out of dead and poore things in the world raiseth strengeth and Majestie: that those that they trampled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and accounted as dead men, the Lord made out of them such a
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:14764:206"/>
living stocke, that all the power of <hi>Canaan</hi> was not able to hold up, and make head against them (they were such a powerfull Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie) but hid themselves in Caves, and became as dead men, to give place to these dead men.</p>
                  <p>Here is the wonderfull great glory of the Almightie out of meere nothing, to worke all things, and as he made all things that are seene out of nothing <hi>(for by faith we learne that things that are seene, were made of things that are not seene)</hi> so he still continueth to lay his foundation in basenesse and humilitie, in a ridiculous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to flesh and bloud, yet out of that hee bringeth large and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite majestie and glory, such as no man can aspire in his thoughts to thinke sufficiently of.</p>
                  <q>Give mee a burying place to bury my dead.</q>
                  <p>Behold, he calleth here <hi>Sarah, his dead,</hi> he calleth her not Wife, though it is said after in the Text, that <hi>Abraham buried Sarah his wife;</hi> yet that is in respect of the time of her life, when they lived toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in respect of the former societie, and converse they had: but now he speakes to the point, she is no more his Wife, but his <hi>dead.</hi> It is translated by all in the <hi>Neuter Gender,</hi> not my dead shee, but <hi>my dead,</hi> simply in the <hi>Neuter gender,</hi> as a thing which now had not so much relation.</p>
                  <p>So it is true, when men and women are severed by Death, they are no more man and wife, but one anothers dead. For as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, <hi>Doe you not know that as long as a man liveth, his wife is subject to him, and shee must not converse with another?</hi> So likewise for men againe: but when God dissolveth the contract by Death, then as she is free for another man, so she is no more his Wife: so long as she was alive upon the ground she was his Wife, but now when she is to goe into the ground he calleth her <hi>his dead,</hi> but not his Wife.</p>
                  <p>The substance and summe is this; That Matrimonie is Gods blessing for present use of mankind, for the propagating of the <hi>Species,</hi> to continue the seed of man to the worlds end, that there may be still a generation to praise God their Creatour; and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a temporall thing ordained for the office of this life, it ceaseth when Death commeth: there is nothing but Death, and that which Christ speakes of in the Gospell, can make a separation: when Death commeth all relations cease, and a wife is no wife, and a husband is no husband.</p>
                  <p>Behold out of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> the infinite love of God in Christ that hath made all things, all unions, and contracts, hath made all to be void but his owne: for our Lord Jesus in life and death is our Husband, our Lord, our Master, our Father, as well in the one as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:14764:206"/>
whereas by the intercourse of Death all things are dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, two of the best friends that are may part upon discontent, and body and soule must part at Death, and Husband and wife (the Symboll of Christ and his Church) must part one from another: yet when all societies and contracts part, Christ doth not part from us, but he is in the Grave, as well as in the highest heavens, our Husband, and Lord, and Spouse, and wee are his Church still, we keepe the same relation, and as strong bonds in death, as in life.</p>
                  <q>My Dead.</q>
                  <p>Yet notwithstanding though she was not <hi>Abrahams</hi> Wife, yet she was <hi>Abrahams dead.</hi> This must teach a man after he is freed by Death from the combination and contract, yet that there is a care remaining to the <hi>Dead,</hi> a love to that, though not as to a Wife: the respects of Man and Wife are carnall and fleshly, Death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and cutteth downe the flesh, therefore cutteth off that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect too: but because she was <hi>dead,</hi> and there was such bonds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them formerly, therefore a man is bound to lament and sorrow for his <hi>dead,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> did here, to love the memorie of the <hi>dead,</hi> to speake well of the <hi>dead</hi> when occasion serveth, to commend them for their vertues, to use the friends of the <hi>dead</hi> (as farre as is in their power) with all courtisie, to bee good to the children of the <hi>Dead,</hi> those that the Mother hath left, and not to cast them into the hands of a furious woman, a new Wife, that neither careth for dead nor living: but to have a speciall regard to the bonds and familiaritie, and that spirituall acquaintance that God made in this life: and so to be good to all that come of that issue for their sakes. <hi>Let me bury my dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly it followeth, why hee would</hi> burie his dead: <q>Out of my sight.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A strange thing, <hi>Out of my sight.</hi> Was his griefe so aggravated, as hee could not still behold her face? or was it necessary that the carkasse it selfe must be conveyed away? must it needs be that the body being now no way amiable, but noisome, must be conveyed out of a mans sight? The best friend in the world cannot endure the sight of a <hi>dead</hi> body, it is a gastly <hi>sight,</hi> especially when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to that dissolution, that the parts begin to have an evill sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and smell, as all have when they are <hi>dead:</hi> then to keepe themselves in life and health, it is necessary to avoid them, to <hi>burie their dead out of their sight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what so sweet a <hi>sight</hi> once to blessed <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Sarah?</hi> What so sweet a spectacle to the world as <hi>Sarah?</hi> The great Kings
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:14764:207"/>
of the world, set her as a <hi>Parragon,</hi> and shee came no where but her beauty enamoured them: shee was a sweet prospect in all eyes, every man gazed on her with great content, to see the beautie of God, as in so many lines marked out in the face of <hi>Sarah.</hi> Yet now she is odious, every eye that looked upon her before, now winkes and cannot endure to looke upon her, shee must bee taken <hi>out of sight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh bethinke your selves of this, you that take pride in this fraile flesh, that pranke up your selves, to make you gracefull in every eye: you that studie to please the beholders, you that are the great Minions of the world: you that when age beginneth to purle your faces, begin to redeeme your selves with paintings: thinke of this. Mother <hi>Sarah</hi> the beautifullest woman in the world, is loathsome to her husband, her sweetest friend: therefore I beseech you in the feare of God, leave these fooleries, and vaine fancies: remember what danger <hi>Sarahs</hi> beauty cast her into; though it were a great gift of God, yet shee had better have beene without it, then to have that hazard of soule and body, that shee was brought to by <hi>Abrahams</hi> travels and necessitie: and know it that your best beauty is to please the eye of God, to looke beautifull in his sight: for the sight of God is never weary; the sight of men will bee weary of you, the best friends you have will loath to see you dead, you will then be grisly in the eyes of men, but the eye of God it is all one even in the dust, and nothing can make you so ill-favoured, but God will like you: therefore labour to please Gods eye that never ceaseth: nothing will make him alter his affection, whereas the eyes of men, this life is so full of foule alterations, as the least sicknesse bringeth an abomination unto them.</p>
                  <p>I see the time prevents me. I will speake a little to the present occasion. We have here a <hi>depositum,</hi> a gage, a pawne of a deare Sister of ours, a woman knowne to you all to be of a holy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian conversation: a neighbour full of peace and quiet, and of good workes according to her calling. Shee was also in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall part a woman of a very good inclination, loving the Word of God, curious and attentive in the hearing of it; Shee was much delighted in it, and desired to communicate the knowledge she had in the Scriptures to others, and to speake of it as often as occasion permitted. By this studie it pleased the Lord to worke a constant and lively faith in her, to put all her trust and confidence in him. She was now taken upon the sudden, therefore the Lord hath left her as a patterne for us to looke upon, to take heed to our selves, that we may make our peace with God, and looke for death eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment, because wee know not how soone wee may be arrested.</p>
                  <p>Shee was indeed a woman of great trust and faith in God: and
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:14764:207"/>
one whose mouth was full of his praise, still admyring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting the wondrous grace of God to her in all the course of her life, in sparing her, in giving her comfort in her conscience, concerning the pardon and forgivenesse of her sinnes, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for her worldly helpes, which she thought never to attaine to: and in many other particulars Shee did open the grace of God according to her best understanding, still giving the praise to his holy Name: and no doubt, it the stroke upon her had not beene so fatall, and as deadly as now it was, wee should have had the like fruit more abundantly at this time. Howbeit shee was not as one altogether destitute, but she called for, and craved the prayers of Gods people, that they would lift up their hearts and hands, and voyces to the Lord to looke upon her, and release her of her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie and trouble, either by life or death, for shee was content ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way.</p>
                  <p>Shee had some touches also of Divine Scripture as occasion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered themselves. As when the light was brought in, shee desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have the light of Gods countenance to shine upon her. And when her eye-strings were broke, that the teares did distill downe, she desired the Lord God to put her teares into his bottle, and many such Luminations there were that came from her.</p>
                  <p>Her surcharged spirits were so taken and strucken, as a man might perceive at the first there was no way but one; her selfe drawing her selfe within, as though that in the outward man there were no roome for the soule to dwell there, or to have a fit and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune habitation.</p>
                  <p>I must needs advertise you of one thing, that this custome of praysing and commending of the <hi>dead</hi> is very full of danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a man may bee a lyer, and a flatterer besore hee be aware, when he never intended it. But truly (for ought that I could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne) this Sister of ours was one that was very well deserving, of a quiet and moderate spirit, intentive and carefull to governe her house and children, and no way exorbitant, for any thing that I can heare.</p>
                  <p>It is true that all are not of one Modell, as the bodies of men and women are not of one height and colour, so the soules and spirits are not all of one elevation neither: but wee esteeme the children of God <hi>according to that they bave received, and not according to that that they have not received,</hi> as the Apostle speakes. I say therefore, <hi>according to the grace shee had received;</hi> I verely beleeve shee was faithfull and true to it, <hi>that shee received not the grace of God in vaine;</hi> she sought by all meanes to nourish and cherish it from one degree to another, and to proceed from <hi>grace to grace.</hi> And therefore I conclude in the judgement of Charitie, that we have very strong hopes, and great probabilities of her happy translation.</p>

                     <pb n="399" facs="tcp:14764:208"/>
Shee was a Daughter of <hi>Sarah,</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speakes of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that he would have them demeane themselves, as Daughters of <hi>Sarah:</hi> and such a one shee was in her habit and attyre, in the manner of her life, and societie, and company: and therefore I doubt not but shee inheriteth with <hi>Sarah</hi> the place of blessed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that the Lord hath made infinite spacious, and wide, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable for all blessed soules that put their trust in him.</p>
                  <p>Now, this let us make use of to our owne soules. In that shee had not that largenesse of time shee supposed to have had, but was surprised so soone and vehemently, as shee could not dispose of her selfe in that manner, as wee know by experience she would have done: it should be a lesson to us to be ready for God, to bee acquainted with God.</p>
                  <p>Wee have had two Corses one after another, one a man, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a woman, both taken suddenly in respect of the time, though they had thought to have made an overture of themselves to the world, and thought to have made all things faire and easie, by the confession and expression of their faith to the world, but they were not suffered to doe it. So, all presume to have time to make the world know that they be humble and penitent, and to make their confession; but many put it off till it be too late. Let us not be put off with vaine presumptions, <hi>the Lord giveth, and the Lord takes,</hi> wee know not how soone. Wee were borne wee know not when, we shall die we know not when. The Lord prepare us all for it.</p>

Others include also his spirituall Conflicts, his combattings with Gods wrath, and his despaires because of his sinnes, together with some sicknesses and strong diseases, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with griefes, and anxieties of minde; In all which he found God benevolous, and mercifull unto him, in the sense of which hee rejoyces, and (as it was his dutie) gives thankes and praises unto God.

                  </p>
                  <p>But not to insist farther upon the translation; The name of <hi>Saints,</hi> is given sometimes by the Fathers to holy men departed, and reigning with God, but so the word is very rarely used in the Scripture: but more ordinarily it is given to the faithfull in this life, and so the notion in Scripture is most frequent. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>To the Church of God at Corinth, called to bee Saints,</hi> or <hi>Saints</hi> by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: So also, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a double sanctitie, 1. Of outward profession. 2. Of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward regeneration, and so the word is here more specially under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; They are Gods <hi>Saints,</hi> whom he separates to himselfe, or calls unto holinesse of life; <hi>The Saints on the earth, such as excell in vertue,</hi> Psal. 16. 3.</p>
                  <p>And there is reason for it, that there be some <hi>Saints</hi> in this life, <note place="margin">Reas.</note>
                     <pb n="403" facs="tcp:14764:210"/>
because that which makes <hi>Saints</hi> is attainable here; not popish Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonization, but Gods Election, Gods Spirit, Gods grace, the Merit and holinesse of Christ; as it is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. Those of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> were <hi>Called to bee Saints with all that in every place call on the name of Iesus Christ;</hi> Who was both, 1. a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of holinesse, that his people might bee so by his example, and 2. a foundation of holinesse, that his fulnesse might bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to his members.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. If there be <hi>Saints</hi> in this life, it is against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which shuts up all the <hi>Saints</hi> into heaven, and suffers none to be <hi>Saints,</hi> but such whom the Pope canonizeth. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers it, 1. That Canonization, which is a publike testification of the assured holinesse, and glory of some, by which publike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships <note place="margin">Tho. Aquin. Quod lib 9. act. 16. Cojet. Trast. de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg. Canus, l. 5. Cap. 5.</note> are decreed them, is pious and lawfull. 2. That this power of Canonization is only in the <hi>Pope.</hi> 3. That the <hi>Popes</hi> judgement in Canonization is infallible. But beside that, this third proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is gain-said by men of his owne side; The practise it selfe also of Canonization was unknowne till <hi>Leo</hi> the thirds time, <hi>anno</hi> 800. or till fourescore yeares after that, till the time of <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> and it was ever anciently held, <hi>that no man can judge infallibly of anothers condition, or may admit any into the number of Saints.</hi> The ancient Church had their commemorations of holy men, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men departed, but without worship. So may wee honourably <note place="margin">Luther, L. de capt. Bab. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancth. in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. Confes. art. 4. 5. 27.</note> speake of such as are with God, and wee doe so; <hi>Luther</hi> calls <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas, Saint,</hi> and <hi>Melanthon</hi> sticks not at it to call <hi>Anthony, Bernard, Dominick,</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> so too. Wee seldome name those glorious Doctours otherwise, then <hi>Saint Basil, Saint Greg. Naz. Saint Ambrose, Saint Augustine.</hi> And so we use to commemorate the holy Apostles, the blessed Martyrs, and the Fathers. And thinke wee have as much liberty as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to call godly men of our late acquaintance Saints, as I remember a learned and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Bishop of ours to have called Master <hi>Greenham.</hi> But withall as the Scriptures doe, so we may also call the living beleevers, and they are so before they come to heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2. If there be some, let us all aspire unto that honour, to bee such as excell in vertue, to be put in <hi>Albo Sanctorum,</hi> and to have our names in the <hi>Calender</hi> or roll. Let us follow the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of Christ, and holy men, <hi>learne of mee,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29. for, <hi>I have given you an example that yee should doe as I have done unto you,</hi> Joh. 13. 15. And let us follow them that have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Christ, to take out the patternes that have beene set us by Apostolicall and holy men. In the ancienter times of more pure and fervent zeale, people were ready to runne to any lights that did burne and shine among them, to take example from them, how to regulate their lives; Hence came many religious professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:14764:211"/>
(though since much degenerate and corrupted,) who were wonne to the immitation of those practises of <hi>selfe-denyall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world, mortifying of voluptuous affections,</hi> &amp;c. which they saw in them. Wee might make a profitable use of the lives of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, and Martyrs of old or of late, to copie out their sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And let it be an incouragement to the study of piety and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to consider what honour it brings along with it, it <hi>Saints us,</hi> so that we need not be at that extreame expence and charge, which wee reade some have beene at in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to procure <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonization.</hi>

If there be some such here, and they bee men holy and religious, then take we heed that we speake not ill of such, that we abuse them not, that we open not our mouthes against heaven, against them that are <hi>Incolae coeli, Inhabitants of heaven,</hi> either by an actuall possession of glory, or here by an heavenly conversation. Devout and religious men, whose thoughts and hearts are above, doe not count this their Countrey, they doe but sojourne with us; abuse not strangers then, especially these strangers for their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey sake.

Gods Saints doe also die. <hi>The Death of his Saints]</hi> Holinesse frees not from death. <hi>Abel, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the Apostles, the Fathers, are all dead. <hi>Your Fathers, where are they? and the Prophets, doe they live for ever?</hi> Zach. 1. 5. <hi>God cuts off both the righteous and the wicked,</hi> Ezek. 21. 4. <hi>The righteous perisheth, and the</hi> (hhasidim) <hi>the mercifull men,</hi> or the men of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse <hi>are taken away,</hi> Es. 57. 1.

The <hi>sting</hi> of it is gone. And though it have not a pleasant looke to entertaine us with, it is but as a rude groome that opens the gate by which we must passe to a better place, and to better company. The godly have many advantages by death, 1. <hi>Rest from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi> 2. A <hi>Crowne</hi> when they have <hi>finisht the race,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 7, 8. 3.

They goe presently to God. <hi>While we are at home in the body, wee are absent from the Lord: Wee are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to bee present with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 6. 8. <hi>I desire to bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved; to bee with Christ,</hi> Phil. 1. 23. 2 Tim. 4. 6. Wee wrong death, when we call it horrid, it is sinne which makes it to be so, else it is but conceit. There is often more paine in a tooth-ake, then in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Teares, and blacke cloth, and the tremblings of the guilty doe disguise Death, and make it looke terrible. Hee that said, <hi>it was of all terrible things the most terrible,</hi> was himselfe an Heathen,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:14764:212"/>
and knew not what Christ had done to alter the property. Once indeed it was uncouth and hideous, but since Christ dyed, it hath a more faire and pleasant face. There can bee no danger in that way, which all the <hi>Saints</hi> have gone. As <hi>Phocion</hi> said to one, that by the same sentence of the Judges was to dye with him; <hi>Art thou not glad to fare as Phocion doth?</hi> So, are wee not glad to fare as the holy <hi>Patriarkes, Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> have done, and to goe after them? Hee that went this way the first of any man-kind, was holy, a <hi>Saint,</hi> it was <hi>Abel</hi> whom God accepted. Wee use to call those passages and <hi>Streights</hi> which have beene first found and discovered by any, by the names of the first Discoverers, as the <hi>Streights of Magellanus,</hi> and that a little lower, <hi>Schouten Streight,</hi> or <hi>Fretum le maire;</hi> So if it may afford us any comfort for the passage, let us call Death no longer Death, but <hi>Abels streights.</hi> Let us learne, if not to love, yet to contemne Death, that so wee may have the more easie conquest over all other hard things. It was a bravery in <hi>Damindas</hi> an heathen (which Christians should be ashamed to come short of,) When <hi>Philip</hi> had broke into <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponesus,</hi> and some <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> said; <hi>They were likely to sustaine much evill, unlesse they could reconcile themselves to Philip; Damindas</hi> said; <hi>O Semi-viri quid nobis poterit acerbè accidere, qui mortem contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimus? Ah poore spirited men, what can be sharpe or hard unto us, who have learned to despise death it selfe?</hi>

Because <hi>Saints,</hi> or holy men, doe also die, let us make the best use of them while they are with us; To benefit and profit ourselves by our religious friends, acquaintance, neighbours and kindred. When God raises up some man eminent for wisedome, and a godly life, hee is set up as a light for the towne or neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to walke by; Yet oft-times such as dwell neere, are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and neglect their benefit, when strangers farther off draw neere unto the light, and gaine by it; as wee use to let our owne bookes lye by, and rather make use of such as we borrow, to take notes out of them, because we know not how soone they may be called for by the owners, and presume that the other will still be in our keeping. Wee should improve our good acquaintance, and walke by the light while we enjoy it, because many times the Sunne sets, and it is night in a neighbourhood or a family, when a good friend, a good Parent, or a good Master dyeth.

                  <p>I have hastened over these points, that I might come to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie that I am to give to our deceased Brother, Master <hi>Iohn Moulson,</hi> which I may not omit, nor to be particular in it, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver such a subject of discourse before, such an exemplary man.

                  <p>Hee copyed out in his life the old way of Christianitie, and writ so faire after those Primitives, that few now can imitate his hand.

But you may take notice,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Of <hi>his morall parts;</hi> where I commend foure things,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>His calmenesse and moderation of affection.</hi> No passion was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be a tyrant in him; they had an <hi>aequipoise.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>His affable cariage,</hi> and easinesse of accesse, by which like an other <hi>Poplicola</hi> hee gained reputation, and the loue of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood where euer he dwelt. Some are so <hi>hairy</hi> and <hi>rough</hi> like <hi>Esau,</hi> that they may be discerned by their <hi>handling,</hi> and some so <hi>churlish</hi> as <hi>Nabal, that a man cannot speake unto them;</hi> Which soure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and clowdinesse of spirit, I wish were not a blemish to many that give their names unto religion. He honoured it by his sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and affability.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>His grave deportment and cariage.</hi> As nothing is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible then a light youthly wanton old man, so the gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and wrinkled cheekes accompanied with sage gravity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands respect from the beholders, as that old grave Bishop <hi>Paph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius,</hi> though he had lost an eye, did from the Emperour <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi> Gravity dwelt in the face of this man, and his very presence was such, as would discountenance the rude and prophane.</p>

Hee read three chapters in the Old Testament, and three in the New every day. 3. After dinner he called not for game for digestion, but read a Chapter before he rose from table. 4. Hee catechised his children and servants constantly, according to some plaine forme. 5.

                  <p n="2">2. Though he were meeke in his owne cause, yet hee was <hi>zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in Gods.</hi> Hee could not endure any thing repugnant to holy Scripture; nor would he neglect, either seasonably to admonish, or reprove the faulty that were within the compasse of his admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, or to whet on, and <hi>exhort</hi> others <hi>to love and good workes.</hi>

Hee counted himselfe rich, because hee needed not all that he had, but could have lived with lesse; for, <hi>hee that can make a little to bee his measure, all else that hee hath is his treasure,</hi> which was the observation of a good <hi>Poet,</hi> but a better and a more mortified <hi>Divine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>His humilitie,</hi> and even among the very temptations to pride. It is an hard thing to be humble in an humble and low estate, but much more difficult in the affluence of outward things. You know his kindred and his relations, yet as he manifested this grace in his whole cariage, so in particular in not being puffed with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and sisters greatnesse, or the advancement of his children.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>His diligence in the use of the meanes of grace; 1. Hee had a right conceit of Sermons,</hi> most relishing, such as were most wholsome and usefull for edification. 2. <hi>Hee tooke paines to heare.</hi> Hee was often knowne in his younger time, to goe ten miles on foot, in those times of greater scarcitie. 3. <hi>His behaviour in the Church</hi> in the time of prayer, and in hearing, was very observable for his reverend at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance and devotion.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>His answerable practise,</hi> fitted and proportionable to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior profession. 1. <hi>Hee was much in private prayer.</hi> If you would have a tryall of sinceritie, follow a man home, and to his closet, and see what hee doth within dores; for there may bee many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects that may set a man on worke <hi>coram populo.</hi> Secret prayer if it bee constant, cannot lodge long with hypocrisie in the same heart. 2. <hi>Hee was often,</hi> as they say, <hi>in secret fasting by himselfe alone;</hi> a Dutie not only lamentably neglected in these lazie times of easie Christianitie, but ill spoken of too, as a character of a <hi>Pharisee,</hi> by such as are loath to be at the paines of subduing their bodyes, and yet are desirous to come off with the credit and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of religion. 3. <hi>Hee was temperate in his dyet,</hi> and in his habit sober and grave, as counting wisedome and grace a better, and trimmer dresse then Lace or the fashion; and so hee was in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, though constantly chearefull, yet a man of little mirth or delight in any thing but spirituall. 4. <hi>Hee was full of charitie,</hi> which appeared in these particulars. 1. Alwayes upon the Lords

day he had sixe poore at dinner, to every one of which hee gave a piece of beefe away with them besides, and at night hee sent what was left to other poore; Besides what hee gave at his dore, and what hee gave privately to the poore <hi>houshold of faith.</hi> 2. His hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalitie according to his ranke, was such as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> reported of <hi>Martin Bucer, whose table was ever open to any good people,</hi> especially to Ministers, whom he much respected. 3. Hee sate up many nights for the comfort of thesicke; not thinking that worke of mercy sufficiently performed by an <hi>How doe you,</hi> or a cold visit. 4. Hee had a Sympathie with the condition of Christs Church abroad.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the last place, let us view him in his last act, <hi>his sicknesse and death, which</hi> as the Text hath told us, <hi>is pretious in the sight of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hee prepared himselfe to die, not only being <hi>willing,</hi> but <hi>desirous also to bee set at libertie,</hi> being often at S. <hi>Pauls, Cupio dissolvi,</hi> which they that were with him, say, was much in his mouth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hee was very thankfull for Gods assisting him with memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and understanding to the very last, for the continuance of which he prayed, and desired others that were about him to pray.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hee employed both his memorie and speach, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and counsell of such as visited him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Hee made a confession of his faith, but chiefly in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Iustification by faith</hi> (which an eminent <hi>Roman Prelate</hi> called a <hi>good supper doctrine)</hi> and in the comfort of that point, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed his soule to Christ, and <hi>slept</hi> sweetly <hi>in the Lord.</hi> Thus as his life was holy, his <hi>death</hi> was <hi>pretious.</hi> Hee made no great noyse in the world, nor raised greater expectations of himselfe then hee could well manage, like many exhalations that rise out of dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills, as if they meant to reach the skie, but presently fall downe againe, and wet us: But as a taper hee gave light till hee went out, and now hee is gone wee will leave upon his Grave, <hi>Memoria ejus in Benedictionibus,</hi> and apply to him the words of the Text; <hi>Pretiosa in oculis Iehovae, Pretious in the sight of the Lord, is the death of his Saints.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I reade these words, I am in a great doubt, whether I should rather admire the excellencie of the temper of these Saints, or deplore the vilenesse of ours; so cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall the one, so terrestriall the other; so noble the one, so ignoble the other; so magnanimous the one, so abject the other. These Saints they did duly consider, that our life it is but a Pilgrimage: that this whole world is but a Diversorie, or Inne to refresh us for a while; that it is a warfare, all things within us, without us, our enemies; that this body is but a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> a Tent, a Cottage, an <hi>earthen vessell,</hi> a <hi>Gourd,</hi> the scabbard, the prison of the soule; more brittle then glasse, decaying, mouldering of itselfe, though it bee preserved from eternall injuries of ayre or weather: they saw the vanitie, the vacuitie, the emptinesse of the things of this life; their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were alienated, estranged, and divorced from the world; they had by watchings, fastings, grovelings on the ground, teares and groanes scoured off the drosse of their soules, and made them po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished statues of pietie; they had made up their accounts betweene God and themselves, and had sued out their pardon for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and failings, and had that seated in their consciences; they did penetrate the cloudes with the eye of faith, and did see the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:14764:217"/>
good things layd up for them in heaven, with which being ravished, and impatient of cunctation and delay, they desire to be vested in the possession of them, though it were with the depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their <hi>house of clay,</hi> which they did beare about them. Of these things they had not a bare conjecture, but a certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; <hi>For wee know,</hi> ver. 1. <hi>that if our earthly house of this tabernacle bee dissolved, wee have a building not made with hands, eternall in the heavens:</hi> from this full perswasion did arise this heavenly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>in this wee groane earnestly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But alas, how different is our disposition from this heavenly temper! how pale, how wanne is our countenance at the mention of Death! at the least summons of our last accounts! <hi>as vinegar to our teeth, as smoake to our eyes;</hi> as a sudden dampe to our lights, as an horrid cracke of thunder in the middest of our jollities, so is the mention of Death. If any aske the reason of this, it is too manifest; Want of judgement, what is the true good of the sonnes of men; Want of apprehension of the happinesse of the Saints; Want of faith in God, of Union with Christ, our soules never make any holy peregrination from the body, and seate themselves with Angels and Archangels, and trace the streetes of <hi>New Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem;</hi> wee anticipate not the joyes of the life to come by devout meditations and contemplations: wee have not <hi>our conversation in heaven, from whence wee looke for our Redeemer: Our soule thirsteth not, our flesh longeth not after the living God.</hi> The reason of this is, wee hang upon the teats of the world like babes and children, we suck venome out of it to our soules; wee walke upon our bellies as uncleane beasts, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, wee jutte against God, and offend him; our accompts are not streight and even, therefore wee are afraid at the appearance of our Saviour, and of our citation to appeare before his Tribunall; wee groane when wee heare of death, wee groane not that we may dye, this is our condition; and are not these different one unto another? Doth not this staine the verdure of our countenances, and cover us with shame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, to observe so manifest a declination of the fervor of the Spirit? That you desire this heavenly temper, I doubt not I should offer violence to Charitie, the Queene of Graces, if I should thinke otherwise? For this cause many of you are strict in the performance of holy duties, agreeable, and convenient to this sacred time: That your devotions may attaine a happy end, let mee lend you an helping hand, whilst I discourse these words which even now sounded in your eares. <hi>In this wee groane earnestly,</hi> &amp;c. Which I will resolve into three propositions.</p>

That wee are <hi>strangers,</hi> doe not the sacred Oracles declare? <hi>our conversatinn, our politie is in heaven,</hi> saith the Doctor of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>Our life it is hid up with Christ,</hi> Col. 2. <hi>Wee are fellow Citizens with the Saints, of the houshold of God. Ephes.</hi> 2. Doth not the chiefe of the Apostles intreat us <hi>as Pilgrims and strangers, to abstaine from fleshly lusts, which fight against the soule?</hi> and doe not these and the like demonstrate unto us, that a Christian lives with men, yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovemen in earth, yet in heaven; bound, yet free; deteyned with us, yet farre above us; living a double life; one manifest; the other <hi>Hid with Christ;</hi> one contemptible, the other glorious; one natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, the other spirituall; that his Parentage is from heaven, that his <hi>Treasure is in heaven;</hi> that his heart is in heaven; that his roote is fastened in the <hi>everlasting mountaines,</hi> though his branches are here below, that his dwelling is in heaven, though his peregrination be here on earth? and did not these Oracles tell us thus much, yet are there not enforcing arguments to convince us of this Truth.</p>
                  <p>Are not they <hi>strangers</hi> that are out of their proper place? and are not Christians while they are here out of their place? Is this world made for Man, an Arke of travell, a Schole of vanitie, a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borinth of errour, a Grove full of thornes, a Meadow full of Scorpions; a flourishing garden without fruit, a fountaine of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie, a river of teares, a feigned fable, a detestable frenzie: and is this the place of man? What meanes the fabricke of our body lifted up to heaven, our hands, eyes, head upward, but to shew us as <hi>Chalcidius</hi> the heathen man observed, that our Progenitors are from heaven, that our place is in heaven. Every place is adequate to the thing placed in it; is this world adequate to man? are not his desires infinitely extended beyond the same? Every place hath a conseruing vertue in it: Doth this world preserve man? well may it minister a little food to this beast of ours, which we carry about us, but can it afford the least favorie morsell to the soule? it were to be wished that it did not poyson, contaminate, and defile the soule: so that the safest way for the soule, is to flie from the world, as from the face of a Serpent: Is this world the place of man, why doth our tender Mother the Church, assoone as wee come into the world, snatch us out of the world; and as soone as wee breathe in the ayre, <hi>bury us by Baptisme</hi> in the Grave of Christ, and assoone as we move in this world, consigne us with the <hi>signe of the Crosse, to fight against the world, and all the pompes</hi> of the same, and are not wee <hi>strangers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Are not they <hi>strangers,</hi> that have different lawes, and divers customes, and another Prince to rule and command them? You have heard of the <hi>Prince of the ayre,</hi> and the <hi>Lawes of the flesh;</hi> of the <hi>fashions of the world,</hi> of the <hi>wisedome that is from below,</hi> and earth-creeping: Are Christians guided by these rules? have they
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:14764:218"/>
not the God of heaven and earth, the <hi>Lawes</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>the wisedome that is from above,</hi> and customes that are from heaven, whereby to regulate them? Who are the men of this world? are they not those who have the <hi>God of this world</hi> to raigne in their hearts? who are led captive by him? <hi>whose under standings are darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> their wills obfirmated, their hearts hardened, their consciences seared, their conversation defiled with all uncleannesses, their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses open breaches for sinne to enter; their tongues blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the name of God? and are these conversations fit for the Saints? and are they not <hi>strangers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Are not they <hi>strangers</hi> that are not capable of honours, of possessions in the place wherein they live, as being not free Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the place? and is not this proper to Christians, whose du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it is to vilifie riches, and honours, and pleasures in themselves, asmuch as they that have these doe others that have them not? to account riches the greatest povertie, and pleasures the greatest tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and honours the greatest ignominie, and power the greatest weaknesse; not to <hi>possesse the world;</hi> not to enjoy it, not to account any thing good that maketh not the owner better, not to admit any thing from the world, but so farre as it may advance the true Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of man, the puritie of <hi>the Image of God,</hi> his restitution to his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient descent, his re-estating him in the possession of heaven, and the societie of Angels and Archangels, to rise up in Armes against this materiall world, and to rend himselfe from this <hi>faeculent</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and out of the greatnesse of his Spirit, and noblenesse of his disposition to be altogether ambitious of the presence of God, and of these constant and unchangeable good things? This is the dutie of Christians, and are not they <hi>Strangers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Are not they <hi>strangers</hi> that have double Impost, and double customes, and the greatest taxations layd upon them? is not this peculiar unto the Saints in this life? have they not afflictions layd upon them in the greatest measure? must they not <hi>through many afflictions enter into the kingdome of heaven?</hi> Have they not <hi>teares,</hi> and that in abundance, <hi>for their meat, and for their drinke?</hi> Have they not enemies from within, and enemies from without? Must they not bee <hi>conformable</hi> to their head Christ, <hi>their elder brother:</hi> as he had his double portion this life, of afflictions and punishments; so must they have; as he was sanctified by afflictions, so must they also. The gold is not pure, unlesse it bee tryed; nor the water sweet, if it have not a current; nor the vessell bright, unlesse it be scoured; nor the Saints fit for heaven, unlesse they be prepared by afflictions: what man was there that ever set himselfe seriously, either to reforme himselfe or others, that found not great oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition from himselfe, and from others? and are not these <hi>strangers?</hi>

Are not they <hi>strangers</hi> that are <hi>ad placitum Principis</hi> to stay in the Land, or to be gone; according as hee shall manifest his royall pleasure by his Proclamation? and are not we here in the world upon these termes? how soone all of us, or any of us shall bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed, who knowes? who dares promise to himselfe the late eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or secure himselfe of the least atome or moment of time? hee that dreamed waking of long continuance, had scarce libertie to dreame sleeping, for <hi>that night they tooke away his soule;</hi> and hee himselfe was branded to succeeding generations with the name of a <hi>foole,</hi> and are not wee <hi>strangers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Did not the Saints of God, whose judgements were most refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, those that had the honour to approach most neere unto God himselfe, alwayes so repute themselves? Doth not the holy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch that <hi>wrestled with God,</hi> and had principalitie over him?

What should I instance in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars? are they not summed up to my hand by the Apostle? <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13: All these Patriarkes, Prophets, Saints, all of them did acknowledge themselves to bee strangers. Examples have in them an universalitie of Doctrine and instruction, especially the examples of the Saints, because <hi>Praxis Sanctorum,</hi> is <hi>Interpres prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptorum,</hi> the practice of the Saints, is the best interpretation of the precept. Examples have in them a directive force, because those that are best disposed in mind and body, are a rule for the rest. Examples have an incentive force, to give life, spirits, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, transmining by a kind of <hi>Metem Psychosis,</hi> the soule, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the resolutions, the affections of the patterne, to him that reades it, extorting deepesighes, and teares, and groanes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alterations at their pleasure. And if any Examples have this force, have not these much more? Other examples have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of men, these have the restimonie of God himselfe, <hi>hee is not ashamed;</hi> (a wonderfull condiscention of the one, and the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame elevation of the other) <hi>to bee called their God, the God of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, and of Isaac, and of Iacob; the Father of the faithfull, and the God of the beleevers:</hi> There are examples whereof men boast, but
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:14764:219"/>
God is ashamed of them, corrupt examples of wicked; the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect examples of heathen men, of these God is ashamed; but of these God is not ashamed, and shall wee be ashamed of them?</p>
                  <p>Wee are then <hi>strangers.</hi> Let mee instill into your eares, the voyce of that was heard in the Temple, before the ruine of it, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gremus hinc,</hi> Let us goe from hence. Let mee say unto you with our Saviour, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Let us goe from hence,</hi> let us trusse up our fardles, and on with our sandals, and promote our way to heaven; Let us depose and lay downe all burthens and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and make our selves expedite, and fit for our journey; wee are in an Inne, let us looke about us, and leave nothing behind, but carry all with us, or send it before us; wee have but an instant of our abode here, let us imploy it to the best advantage: It is the greatest losse, it is the most shamefull losse, it is the most irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable losse that may bee, to lose this instant upon which eternitie depends; eternitie of miserie, or eternitie of felicitie: let us follow our Saviour, let us seeke his face, let us ascend with him, let us not rest here.

                  <p>That the Saints desire a true and proper house; <hi>In this we groane earnestly,</hi> &amp;c. What is meant by this house, whether the <hi>Ioyes of heaven,</hi> or a <hi>Glorified body</hi> is hard to determine by the context, I incline to <hi>Calvins</hi> opinion, that both are meant, as making up that compleat house which the Saints desire, the one as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troition, the other as the consummation of their blisse; and into both these houses, I shall labour to introduce your spirits and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
                  <p>The first house is the <hi>Ioyes of heaven,</hi> a kingdome else-where; for the amplitude, for the abundant sufficiencie, for the honour, royaltie of them; yet because many in kingdomes see not the face of the King, and of those that see his face, few are of his house and familie; and of those that are of his Court, few are familiar with him, or converse with him; and of those that converse with him, few are his sonnes, his heires. Therefore this kingdome is an house wherein all see the face of God; all are of his house, all converse with him, all stand in his presence, all are his sonnes, all are his heires; a house so scituated, as never any; upon the brow of that hill, which is the <hi>beauty of perfection,</hi> the <hi>delight,</hi> not <hi>of the wholeearth,</hi> but of heaven itselfe, in the purest ayre that ever was, even puritie it selfe, freed from all malignant vapour; a place
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:14764:219"/>
irriguous with the chrystall streames of Paradise it selfe, a place inriched with all the precious things the heart of man can desire; an house not built by man, but by God himselfe; not of terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all feculent matter, not of gold or silver, but that which excells all valuation whatsoever; the hanging or ornaments of which house, are not of Arras, or Tissue, or cloth of gold, or whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is more precious with men, but farre above these, such and so excellent, that <hi>Neither eye hath seene, nor eare hath heard; neither hath the like entred into the hearts of men.</hi> The delights of this house are such, that if all the contentments and delights, that ever ravished the hearts of men in their private houses were put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet were they but as a candle to the Sunne, as a drop to the Ocean: Oh the statelinesse and magnificence of the Hall of this house, wherein are Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, Confessours. Saints, Angels, the blessed Virgin especially, all of them prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and lauding God! <hi>Blessed are they that dwell in this house, they will be still praising thee.</hi> Here in this life are varietie of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments according to the diversitie of mens Callings, and their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities; but there shall bee no necessitie, there shall bee but one worke, the worke of <hi>Praise,</hi> a duty which in this life is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with fatigation and wearinesse; but there it shall be done with all sweetnesse and delight: this delight increasing with the continuance of the same. No vaine thoughts, to interrupt this dutie, no wearinesse of the flesh to weaken this dutie, no necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or indigencie to rend us from this duty; but as it will bee our happinesse to love, and see God; so it will be the exercise of our happinesse to admire, and to laud God: while wee are here, such is the weaknesse of our apprehension, that wee cannot with the same act conceive the worke, and the workman; we cannot thinke of the benefit, and the authour of the same, then wee shall be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to joyne both these together, so to admire the worke, as at the same time to praise the authour; so to contemplate the benefit, as at the same time to fall downe before the benefactour. Oh the statelinesse of this presence, where the face of God, the beautie of God, the Majestie of God is seene in so glorious a manner, that even Angels, and Archangels <hi>cover their faces,</hi> not being able to behold stedfastly the great lustre of the same! Oh the loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the <hi>chambers of the King,</hi> made for the soule to repose her selfe in all spirituall delight, after her labour and travell in this miserable world! oh the beauty of the <hi>Masions</hi> of this <hi>house</hi> prepared by Christ himselfe for the soule, to refresh her selfe with all spirituall food! and oh the varietie and excellencie of the food of this <hi>house,</hi> the understanding shall have his food morning and evening knowledge; a cleare view of all things, not in themselves, or in their causes, but in their exact <hi>Ideas,</hi> subsisting in the essence
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:14764:220"/>
of God, but especially the radiant vision of the face of God, the Essence of God, the Sunne of righteousnesse. The will shall have her food, goodnesse, joy, delectation, not by measure, but drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the full ocean of these, with that stabilitie and confirmation that shee cannot will that which is evill; The affections shall have their food, being fully satisfied beyond their desires. The Body shall have his food, being made an impassible, clarified, agill, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall body, defecated, and purified from this feculent elementarie food, and all other alterations common to it with beasts: and which is most wonderfull, the King of Kings shall gird himselfe to reach out these Joyes unto us; they shall bee administred unto us <hi>Ve jad hammelek,</hi> by the hand, by the power of a King; Did I say this of my selfe, who would give credence unto me? but Truth saith it, <hi>Luke 12. 37. Blessed are those servants whom hee shall find watching; verely I say unto you, that hee shall gird himselfe, and make them sit downe to meate, and will come forth and serve them.</hi> Oh won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull dignation! who ever heard of the like? <hi>Stat Catodum Lixa bibit,</hi> the Lord stands, the servant sits; the Lord is girt, the servant is loosed; the Master is reaching out full bowles, and the servant is inebriated with the rivers of these pleasures; once hee girt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to wash his Disciples feet, and the servant was astonished to see so great a Majestie condescending to so meane ministerie; shall wee not bee much more ravished with this ineffable dignation, when he shall againe gird himselfe to supply the soule with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable delight, as if God himselfe intended nothing in heaven, but to heape content upon them that <hi>sit downe with Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, in the kingdome of heaven;</hi> This is the <hi>fatnesse,</hi> the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of this <hi>house;</hi> with the weake adumbration whereof, I doubt not but that your hearts are so taken, that yee have reduced all your desires to this one with the Psalmist; <hi>One thing have I desired of the Lord, which I will desire, even that I may dwell in his house, and behold the beautie of the Lord.</hi> And I wonder not when I contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the Majestie of God, I wish my selfe all feare; and when I consider the power of God, I wish my selfe all humilitie; and when I meditate on the goodnesse of God, I wish my selfe all Love; and when I contemplate the Beautie of God and of this house, I wish my selfe all desire, and so doe you also: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with unanimous votes you request me to conduct you to the gates of this <hi>house,</hi> whereby you may enter into the same, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the magnificence of this House, so there are many gates whereby wee may enter; and all of these <hi>reaching</hi> even <hi>to the Earth</hi> with the foot of <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder.</p>
                  <p>There is the gate of <hi>Faith,</hi> by it we have <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="423" facs="tcp:14764:220"/>
and cleave close unto God; by <hi>this wee live in Christ,</hi> and <hi>Christ in us;</hi> by <hi>this</hi> our hearts are purified, our <hi>consciences washed with the bloud of Christ,</hi> and fitted to see God, and to enter into the <hi>holy of holyes,</hi> unto which no uncleane thing can be admitted. This is one Gate.</p>
                  <p>Another is the gate of <hi>Hope,</hi> which <hi>entreth within the Vaile,</hi> and bringeth us neerer unto God; <hi>this</hi> grace taketh us by the hand, and leadeth us through the streetes of <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> and sheweth us the <hi>Temple of the Lambe,</hi> and the <hi>Lambe</hi> sitting in his Temple, assuring us that wee shall live there with him; <hi>this</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> heaven before heaven, the life of the Soule, the keeper of Christ, the keeper of God: This is a second Gate.</p>
                  <p>There is another Gate, the gate of <hi>Charitie;</hi> by this we enter not, but presse in unto God, and are not led, but transported unto God, and carried in a <hi>fierie Chariot.</hi> By this grace we approach not neere unto God, but forgetting the greatnesse of his Majestie, wee lay hold on him, we hang upon him, we imbrace him, we familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converse with him, we freely consult with him, we inseparably cleave unto him more close then any <hi>Polypus</hi> doth unto the Rock.</p>
                  <p>Another gate, is the gate of <hi>humilitie,</hi> a low gate, but a sure and certaine gate, the exaltation of the soule, the honour, the dignitie of the soule, that which subjects the soule immediatly to God, and so seateth it above all the creatures; that gate whereby the soule steales into heaven, though the gate bee never so streight, by crouching, bowing, bending, pinching of it selfe. At these gates, if you knocke earnestly by devout prayer, and frequent Almes, you may enter into this glorious and magnificent <hi>house,</hi> with which the Saints <hi>desire to bee cloathed upon:</hi> and this is the first <hi>house</hi> which they desire.</p>
                  <p>There is another <hi>house</hi> which the Saints desire, and that is the <hi>house of their bodies</hi> glorified: while they are here in this life, they have a cottage rather than a house, a cottage seated in a low wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie marish place, exposing the soule to Agues, Feavers, and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of diseases, so that shee is sometimes downe; at the best but crasie and valetudinarie: scarse any vicissitude and change, either of age, or place, or calling; but the soule is dangerously affected with it, and in great hazard; a dangerous Cottage, ready to fall upon the soule, and crash it in pieces; a cottage full of holes and rifts; in every storme, and tempest of adversitie it raines through this cottage into the soule, and makes the soule unhealthie; in the Sun-shine of prosperitie, the beames of the Sunne beate upon the soule, and make it faint and weake, many times a ruinous cottage, so that the inhabitant is forced to spend almost all his time in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing it, in keeping it up, in supplying the necessities of it; distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, rent, and torne with cares and sollicitudes for it, so that
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:14764:221"/>
little time is left for better duties, for duties proper to the inner man, and when the soule setteth her selfe to these duties, then this Cottage is an impediment unto her, taking off her minde from it by some sudden gust of a vaine thought, or hindring her by some indisposition, or compelling her by some urgent necessitie, to breake off before shee is willing. These and the like incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances doe much afflict the Saints, therefore they <hi>desire to bee cloathed upon,</hi> with a pure <hi>house,</hi> a pleasant <hi>house,</hi> a lightsome <hi>house,</hi> a healthfull <hi>house,</hi> a durable <hi>house,</hi> a glorious <hi>house</hi> that might bee a helpe and incouragement to the soule in holy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties. <hi>In this wee groane earnestly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>You that are owners of the wonder are not ignorant what a wonder man is, a composure of different natures, Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall, terrestriall; Angelicall, beastiall; corporall, spirituall; greater then the world, lesse then the world; the richest Pearle, and the basest foyle; <hi>the Image of GOD,</hi> and a peece of clay: you are not ignorant how these two are affected one to the other in the Regenerate man, if the body bee sound and well, it kicketh against the spirit; if it bee ill, it afflicts the Spirit. How doe I love my body, as my fellow servant, and eschew it as mine enemie? how doe I hate it as my clogge, and reverence it as my fellow-heire? I buffet it as a slave, and imbrace it as a friend; I chastise it and keepe it under, and then I want a companion to assist mee in the workes of pietie, I cherish it, and nourish it, and then am I stung with the lusts of it; It is a flattering enemie, and a trecherous friend. Oh my conjunction, and oh my alienation! that which I feare I imbrace, and that which I love I feare; before I make warre with it, I am reconciled; and before I am reconciled, I am at variance: what a strange misterie is this! therefore the Saints mortifie and crucifie their bodyes, they gird them close with the cords of strong resolutions, they macerate them with watchings and fastings, and make them thinne, and pale, and wanne, that so they may be serviceable to the Spirit; they labour that their hands may be translucent with fasting, as the hands of <hi>Elphegus</hi> were, that their countenances may bee living documents of humiliation, that their bodyes may bee as transparent glasses, wherein the thoughts of their hearts may be seene, that their soules may have no more residence in the heart, but may as evidently bee seene in every part of the body as there. This they ayme at, and when they have done all this, yet they complaine of the dulnesse, dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, heavinesse, lumpishnesse of the body, and are at enmitie with it, and cry out, <hi>Oh miserable man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> not that they are simply enemies to the body, but to this earthly corruptible body, this sinfull body that depresseth
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:14764:221"/>
the minde musing of many things, and desire the deposition, and laying downe of the same, that so they may receive a glorified, a clarified, an incorruptible spirituall body, not made of a spirit, but serviceable to the spirit; they desire that these eyes may bee so defecated, that if they cannot behold the essence of God, yet they may stedfastly behold the <hi>Empyrian heavens,</hi> the splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of our Saviour, and the lustre of the bodies of the Saints, more bright then the Sunne seven times; they desire that these hands may bee blessed with the contrectation of that sacred body that redeemed them; they desire that this body may be so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and lucid, that the Soule may sally out freely; not at the eye alone, but at every part to contemplate those glorious objects, that it may bee so prelucid, that the very thoughts of the heart, and the divine fancies that are in the imaginative part may bee seene through it, that it may be so stript of corporall densitie and grossenesse, that like lightning it may bee here and there, that it may be fit for raptures, and extasies, and the Soule no more doubtfull whether shee be in the body, or not in the body; This the Saints desire and long after. And let me speake this of you oh triumphant Soules that are now in blisse without the least impeachment of your happinesse. This even you thirst af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you esteeme it an imperfect estate to bee without your bodyes, though you glorifie and praise GOD in your soules, yet you count it an imperfect worke, and say with the Psalmist; <hi>In death no man remembreth thee, and in the grave no man shall give thee thankes,</hi> though your spirits doe it without ceasing, without failing, yet the whole man doth it not; and such an insatiable aviditie, there is in you of the praise of God, that unlesse it bee done totally and fully, you thinke it not done at all, therefore you desire this glorified organe; but the Saints on earth being much more depressed with this heavy clay, cry out with these Saints; <hi>In this wee groane earnestly,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>To bee cloathed upon with our house, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>An improprietie of speech I confesse, for men doe not cloath them selves with houses, yet of eminent elegancie and pregnant, with varietie of instructions: to shew the fitnesse of this glorie to every soule, as apparell is fitted to every body: to shew the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of this glory; as apparell is an ornament to a man: to shew the firme adhesion of this glorie, the whole man as a garment doth cleave close unto him: to shew the redundancie of this glorie, that a man shall inveloppe himselfe in this glorie, as a man doth inwrappe himselfe in his garment: to shew the Authour of this glorie, hee that made garments to cover mans nakednesse in Paradise below, hee maketh robes of honour
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:14764:222"/>
to adorne him everlastingly in Paradice, which is above: to shew the undeservednesse of it on our part, that these garments they are not webbes of our owne spinning, but robes of Gods giving: to shew the all-sufficiencie of this glory, in this life wee need houses to dwell in, and rayment to cover us, and food to nourish us, and fire to warme us; but this glory it shall be a Magazine of all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall store, an house to shelter us, a garment to cover us, Manna to feed us, water to refresh us, it shall be all in all unto us. These and many more instructions are folded up in the Cabinet of this Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, which streights of time will not give mee leave to unfold, and spread before you, but must leave them to your private me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations; and so passing (though unwillingly) from these <hi>two houses</hi> which the Saints desire; I must raise up your attention to their ardent affection unto them. <hi>In this wee groane earnestly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Wherein you see the intention of their affection, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of it; The intention not <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, Desiring earnestly; The expression of it by groanes; <hi>In this wee groane earnestly.</hi> The one the soule, the other the body; the one the forme, the other the exercise; the one the roote, the other the branch; or if you will, the one the fire, the other the fuell; the one the flame, the other the oyle that nourisheth the flame.</p>
                  <p>The first is the intension of the affection. As those that are in a longing passion die if they bee not satisfied: as the pregnant Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther groanes to be delivered of her burthen; as those that are pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed under a heavy weight faint if they be not eased, even so the Saints pressed downe with that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that <hi>eternall weight of glorie,</hi> mentioned in the precedent Chapter, a burthen which did both presse them downe, and raise them up; that did both streigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them and enlarge them; like the feathers of the Dove, which adde to her Masse, but take off from her gravitie, which makes her more corpulent, and yet more light; even so this weight of glory so pressed downe the Saints, that it raised them up to the Throne of the Lambe, and feeling this <hi>body of sinne,</hi> this <hi>body of death,</hi> which they did beare about them as plummets of lead hanging at their feet; they desire eft-soone to bee stripped of all incumbrances and impediments, to depose and lay downe this cottage of clay, that so <hi>being absent from the body, they might be present with the Lord;</hi> this was the violence of their affection. <hi>In this wee groane earnestly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>An affection, worthy the name of an affection, truly grounded, and thereforetowring so high, that it is almost invisible to our weake sight. There are some in this life that are fed with gall and wormewood, with teares and groanes; upon whom the wheele of oppression is roled, breaking all their bones, so that they seeke for death, as for pearles and hidden treasures, as an end and
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:14764:222"/>
period of their miseries. Others there are who seeing the vanitie of the things of this life, and ballancing with them the transcendent excellencie of the Soule of man above the world, had rather be idle, or not be at all, then to be so basely and meanly imployed, and rewarded, as the world doth remunerate her favourites. Others make bitter invectives against the body, as the onely impediment to the soule in her more pure speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, placing the happinesse of the soule, in the separation from the body; all these come farre short of this divine affection, which hath not her rise from the miseries of this life, or from the vanitie of the creature, or from the incumbrances of this cottage, but from a true apprehension of the love of God, from a deepe panting after union with him, from a taste of the powers of the life to come, from a Soule inflamed with a coale from Gods Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. Looke upon these Saints in my Text, they were indeed exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised beyond measure, with those things which wee call miseries, calamities, afflictions; at the mention whereof wee quake like As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen leaves; but were these tainted with impatiencie? were these groanes fuliginous vapours from a malecontented spirit? Did they not account these afflictions their Justs and Barriers, and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, and exercises of honour and chivalrie, at which Angels, and Archangels were present with their <hi>Euges</hi> and approbations, God himselfe the chiefe Spectator, and rewarder of these exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; they themselves tryumphing and boasting in their tryalls, with the impresse of the Apostle on their shields of faith; <hi>Wee are perswaded, that neither death nor life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall bee able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Iesus;</hi> They were more Eagle-eyed by the strength of grace, to pry into the nothingnesse of the creature, then all the Philosophers by the strength of nature; they did morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and crucifie, and keepe under the body, with the lusts thereof, and more truly detest the corruption of the outward man, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Platonist</hi> whatsoever: but were these the grounds, the rise of this celestiall affection? nothing lesse, to see God, to enjoy God, to dwell with him, to converse with him, to be <hi>bee dissolved to be with Christ:</hi> these transported their affections; not the emptinesse of the things below, but fulnesse of things above; not the basenesse of earthly things, but the glorie of celestiall things; not the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this life, or of this crazie vessell, but the happinesse of the life to come; they had but a glimpse of this strange light darted into their soules, and the whole world was darknesse unto it; they had a gust of sweetnesse cast into the palate of their soules, and all things else were bitter and unsavorie: Christ was placed in the summitie and height of their soules, and the desire of the full
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:14764:223"/>
fruition of him caused that fainting, that earnest longing in their spirits.</p>
                  <p>You will say if this be so, what will become of the greatest part of Christians, who are afraid to die? who are so farre from <hi>groaning</hi> to depose this <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> that they groane at the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of dissolution? It is true that all men receive not this saying, neither is it for every one to attaine to this perfection. As there are two sorts of faith, so there are two forts of Christians; there is a strong faith, and a weake faith; and there are strong Christians, and there are weake Christians; the strong Christian is willing to dye, and patient to live; the weake Christian is willing to live, and patient to dye; hee goes when God calls, but he could wish that God would deferre his calling; hee hath good hopes of heaven, but he desires a little more to enjoy the earth; he loves God more then all, yet his affections are not fully taken off from all; hee is not perplexed with the feares of Hell, yet hee is not ravished with the joyes of Heaven; hee hath much strength but knowes it not: as many a Spectator of a prize is better able to performe it, then he that undertakes it; but either through faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart, or ignorance of his owne strength, dare not put it to the hazard, but had rather commend another mans valour, then trye his owne; whereas a strong Christian, a man growne in Christ, sends a challenge to this Gyant Death, singles him out, as a fit object of his valour, grapples with him, not as with his match, but as his underling, insulteth over him, setteth his foot on the necke of this <hi>King of terrours,</hi> and by conquering him, capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates with great facilitie all other pettie feares of ignominie, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie and the like, which therefore are dreadfull, because they tend to Death, the last, the worst, the end, the summe of all fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red evills: this is the unconquerable crowne of Faith; this is the glory of a Christian, this is the Diadem of honour wreathed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Temples, advancing him above all other men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
                  <p>But you will say, may a man desire death? Is this now a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, what meanes the agony of the Apostle? <hi>I desire to bee dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and to bee with Christ.</hi> What meanes the earnest longing of the Spouse? <hi>Apoca. 22. The Spirit saith come, and the Bride saith come; and let him that heares say come.</hi> What meanes her fainting in the Canticles? <hi>I am sicke of love, let him bring mee into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: Let mee see his face, I am sicke unto death: Let mee dye lest I dye, that I may see him for ever.</hi> What meanes the character of a true Christian? <hi>As many as love the appearance of the Lord,</hi> which cannot be without death: What meanes the incredible contempt of death in ancient Christians, insomuch, that it was a received Maxime with the Heathen; <hi>Omnis Christianus est contemptor mortis.</hi> What
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:14764:223"/>
meanes the heroicall encouragement of old <hi>Hilarion, Egredere ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, egredere, quid times? Goe out my soule, goe out, why tremblest thou?</hi> What meanes the words of old <hi>Simion</hi> in the flames; <hi>Thus to die, is to live?</hi> What meanes the rapture of Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> that hee would thanke that man that would kill him, as transmitting him more speedily to those unconceivable Joyes? What meanes this <hi>groaning,</hi> and thirsting in my Text? Doe not these demonstrate that it is lawfull to desire death? Not simply in it selfe, or for it selfe; it is the separation of those two whom God hath coupled; it is a cessation of being; it is an evill of punishment, the daughter of sinne: to desire it simply, were to desire evill, which is abhorrent to nature; much lesse ought wee to hasten our death by violent meanes. Let their memories bee buried in perpeturall silence, as the botches and ulcers of Christianitie, who out of impatience have perpetrated this heinous sinne, a sinne against God and man; against nature, against grace, against the Church, against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, against all things: The Heathen man could say, that we are the possession of God, to be disposed of by him, not by our selves: the body is the structure of God, the worke of his hands, the Tabernacle which hee hath made, and not to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or to bee taken downe, but by his command: while we live, we may advance the glory of God, the good of others; wee may impeople heaven, make up the ruines of Angels; to hasten our death, were to envie this glory to God, this good to others: In that distraction of our Apostle betweene two good things, his owne glory, and the good of others; you know which way the scales inclined, to the good of others; as if he had said, Let my glory be deferred, so Gods glory be increased; let my joy be increased, let my joy be suspended, so the joy of Angels, and of the Court of heaven be intended by the conversion of sinners; Nay more, this is a small thing; Let me be an <hi>Athema,</hi> so <hi>Israel</hi> be blessed, let me be <hi>blotted out of the booke of life,</hi> so thousands bee inserted; let the bowels of Christ be streightened to me, so they bee enlarged to others; this is life indeed, this is the end of our life: this will comfort us in this life, and crowne us in the life to come. Hee that can truly say, that while he lived, hee lived to God, not to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that he sincerely propounded the glory of God, and the good of others unto himselfe; this man may write upon his Tombe, <gap reason="foreign">

Thus, simply to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire death is not good; but cloathe this with some circumstances, and then to desire death is not onely warrantable but commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; when we have done all the good we can, when our lives will be no more serviceable to Church or Common-wealth, when we

                  <p>Againe, when we are called to be <hi>Holocausts,</hi> or sacrifices, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of sweet savours, the Frankincense of the Church to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume others, to deliver up our lives unto God, to seale his Truth with our bloud to encourage others; then we ought to runne unto death with all alacritie, <hi>rejoycing that wee are counted worthie to suffer for his Name,</hi> to triumph, to boast in this out of these cases, to have such a taste of God, such a rellish of the joyes of heaven, such a longing after the presence of Christ, as not to be ready, but to be willing; not to be prepared for the stroake of death, but to be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of it, to esteeme of death as the funerall of sinne, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of vice, the period of miseries, the Charter of freedome, the Pattent of of exemption from evill of sinne, from evill of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the day of our birth, the season of harvest, the seale of our victorie, the haven of our happinesse, our introduction into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, our inauguration into a kingdome; the Chariot of our tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, the day of our returne to our proper house; to our Parents, to our best friends. This is the affection which is required in us, at which we ought to ayme. Let this <hi>house of clay</hi> be resolved into the principles of the same, what wonder if that which is built be throwne downe; and that which is compounded, be resolved; and that which was borrowed of the Elements, bee repayed againe; and that which was taken from the earth, be committed to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie of the earth. Nay, let me triumph in the resolution of this peece of clay into the exilest atome, and admire the counsell of God, that this Carkasse is crumbled into the smallest dust, and sifted into the coursest branne, even to dust and ashes; Were not this body resolved into dust, who would beleeve his originall to be from the earth? what pride, what elevation would follow? what carking and caring for this <hi>earthly Tabernacle?</hi> if now when we see it to be but a spawne of wormes, and the food of Emmits, there is such immoderate excesse; what would there be if the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy were exempted from putrifaction? what desolations would follow in Cities, in Townes? how many would dwell in monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with those whom they have honoured, or affected in their lives? if many be now so impotent, that though the body bee putrified, they cannot forbeare imbracing of it, and to solace themselves, make Pictures of their dead friends, and dote upon

these, what would they not doe if their bodyes were immortall? What neglect would there be of the soule, the better part of a man? who would know the vertue of it, that it is not onely salt to the body to keepe it sweet, but the life, the beauty, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of the body? Who would beleeve the consummation, the period of the world, if our bodyes were immortall? who would mind heavenly things? who seeke those things that are above? what deifying of the body would follow? what Idolatries? what superstitions? what Temples built? what Altars erected? what varietie of Ceremonies instituted to the body? All which God hath pluckt up by the rootes, by this putrifaction, and incin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of our bodyes, by this, teaching us to contemne earthly things, to have our cogitations on heaven, to thinke upon this scale, to ascend up to this Mount, to aspire to this intention, which that we may, let me adde fuell to the fire, and oyle unto the flame, the expression of this affection, to the intention of it, earnest groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to eager desiring.</p>

And this is to <hi>groane earnestly,</hi> in my Text.</p>
                  <p>This is the negotiation of the outward man whereby it trades for heaven, this is the conversion of a peece of clay, into a pile of frankincense; this addes wings unto our <hi>Prayers;</hi> this openeth the eares of God; this dissipateth the cloudes of his countenance; this inclineth him to clemencie towards us; this maketh the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow continent, and the Virgin unspotted; this lifts up the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie Eunuch to the kingdome of heaven; this perfects the grace that is in the soule; this washeth away the staines, and contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations that are in the soule; this is the beautie and comelinesse of a Christian. How lovely were the Ninivites? how glorious was the King in sackcloth, sitting in his throne of dust and ashes? what were his Robes of Majestie and Royaltie to these orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they might dazle the eyes of the body for a time, these da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle the eyes of the mind, even at this day, after so many hundred yeares; they might procure him honour with men, these made him honoured by God himselfe. Letcorporall eyes looke upon an abject, and meane apparance of a King in these weedes, yet doe not spirituall eyes see through these garments, Humilitie, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, submission, feare of God, and the like? and are there any Jewels like unto these? what are those garments which are the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of a worme, to these robes that are the worke of Gods

Spirit? What is a chaine of Pearle, to a chaine of warme and successive teares, beaten out of the rocks of a broken and contrite heart? they may adorne the body, this adornes the soule; and which is more, bindes the hands of God himselfe. Let whose will admire the victories and triumphs of <hi>David</hi> over the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Israel,</hi> which are indeed worthy of admiration; I admire him in his watchings, and fastings, and sackcloth; by them hee overcame flesh and bloud; by these he overcame God; by them he overcame men, by these hee made conquest of himselfe; by them he enlarged the territories of <hi>Israel,</hi> by these hee enlarged the bounds of heaven; by them he made <hi>Hadadezer</hi> flye, by these he made the Angell put up his sword, and God to reverse his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; by them he did remove temporall evils; by these hee did procure everlasting good unto himselfe and others. This is that humiliation which this sacred time requires, not abstinence onely from meates which pamper this carkasse; this is not the body of this fast, but a vehement intention of religious duties above other times; he that prayed twice a-day before, let him now doe it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times; hee that fasted but once in the weeke, let him now doe it three times, or oftner, as his body will permit him, though it be to the sicknesse of the body, it is an happy sicknesse of the bodie, which is the sanity of the soule; hee that gave Almes a little, let him now double, or treble his liberalitie; hee that did delight before in recreations, let him devote that time to prayer, to humiliation: doe not our sinnes require this? our owne sins? the sinnes of others? if not our owne mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series (for which we blesse God) yet doe not the miseries of other Nations, the Churches of God require this? Doe wee not now beate our breasts, and hang downe our heads, and rend our hearts, and punish our selves for our sinnes, that God may not punish them? Did not our sins call upon us for this dutie, yet is not the sight of God, the presence of our Saviour, the joyes of Heaven, the equalitie with the Angels, the glory of a Kingdome worthie a teare, a groane, a sigh, a fast? are they now so contemptible or meane, that no violence is requisite? with what face shall wee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before our Saviour at his Tribunall, when he shall demand of us his teares, his watchings and fastings? when he shall say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, where are my teares? are they <hi>water spilt upon the ground, not to be gathered up?</hi> Where are my sighes and groanes, have they vanished into the ayre? where are my watchings? what not a teare, for so many teares? not a fast, for so many fasts? not a groane for so many miseries which I indured? Had I shed but one teare, should it not have broken up a fountaine of teares in thee? Had I fetched but one sigh, should it not have made thy life a perpetuall sigh: But when I have done so much for thy sake,

shall it be lost? wilt thou doe nothing for thy owne selfe? shall I cast so much seed into the ground, and reape nothing againe.</p>
                  <p>Oh my beloved, what are all our afflictions? what are all the afflictions of our selves, to the least drop of gall that hee tasted, to the least scourge which hee suffered? how can we say that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee loved God or our selves, if wee doe not these things in testimonie of this.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>The Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> in his vision at <hi>Bethel,</hi> saw the Angels of God <hi>ascending and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. So from the thirteenth verse of this Chapter, wee have the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Christ ascending, and descending. For first their generall speaker <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> had made a notable confession of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Divinitie, and had received for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incouragement of himselfe and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, such an excellent testimonie from our Saviour, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of heaven might behold, and observe, and imbrace; <hi>Blessed art thou Simon Bar-Iona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed this to thee, but my Father which is in heaven: and I say thou art Peter, and on this rocke will I build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevaile against it.</hi> Which words were not only appropriate to him, (they were spoken to him) but they were common to all the Apostles: For as <hi>Origen</hi> argues, shall we thinke that the gates of hell prevailed not against <hi>Peter,</hi> but did against the rest? Therefore that which was <note place="margin">Origen.</note>
                     <pb n="438" facs="tcp:14764:228"/>
said to him, was said to all, and being such a glorious commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; behold the Angels ascend.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, what if the earthly minde of man dreame of a Messias temporall, and that they must be promoted to places of eminencie, and stiled <hi>gracious Lords?</hi> the case is too palpable: for if Christ warne his Disciples, and tell them of his approaching death at Jerusalem, hee shall be sure to meet with a checke; no such matter, it shall not be so to thee. Oh! here is a strange metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phise, a sudden alteration; before a Confessor: and now a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller: there is no wisedome of the spirit in this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no commendation for this, but because he was somewhat too forward, <hi>get thee behind mee: for thou art an offence to me;</hi> behold the Angels descend. And surely this carnall wisedome had beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to weigh them downe to the nethermost hell, had not the wisedome of the wisest curbed, and subdued, and restrayned it. What, not suffer? Yes, <hi>Peter</hi> also must suffer; and all that will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christ, must renounce all the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>Which words are an exaggeration of the wofull estate of a temporizing Professor, of a carnall Gospeller, and they reach to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Parts</hi> of the Text.</note> our consideration these foure generalls.</p>
                  <p>First, the excellencie, and worth of mans soule, which is of greater value then the whole world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the possibilitie of the losse, a man may <hi>lose his owne soule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the compossibilitie of outward prosperitie, hee may lose his soule in gaining the whole world.</p>
                  <p>And then lastly, the wofull bargaine in such an exchange, <hi>What is a man profited?</hi> Of these in order.</p>
                  <p>First of the surpassing excellencie, and dignitie of mans soule: <note place="margin">1. The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of mans soule.</note> it is valued and prized here above the whole world. It was the plausible conceit of certaine Philosophers, that the world was a great man, and that man was a little world: a little world indeed, but as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> tearmes him, a great wonder: for within this <note place="margin">Aug.</note> little world, there is a reasonable soule worth all the world. To render an exact definition of the soule, it requires the tongue of an Angell, rather then of a man: it passeth the comprehension of travellers to apprehend the nature of the soule: for these three, God, Angels, and mans Soule, they are unknowne to us; we may sooner admire their excellencie, then conceive their nature; and argue of their opperations, then attaine their knowledge, of such sublimitie is the soule of man, so Angelicall and Divine, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie whereof is commended to us by three distinct voyces, of<list>

                     <note place="margin">1. By nature, and that in respect. <hi>Plato.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>In respect of the Originall, the soule of man hath no beginning <note place="margin">1. Of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall.</note> here: there was no voyce directed to the earth, or to the water, for the production of <hi>Adams</hi> soule, but a serious consultation of the sacred Trinitie, and a <hi>breathing into his nostrils the breath of life.</hi> Saith Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> he created it by infusion, and infused it by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <note place="margin">Aug.</note> And the Philosopher well concludes, that the soule as it is not from without, it is only Divine. Therefore the Manichees <note place="margin">Manichees.</note> extolled it too high, when they deemed it a portion of Gods sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: let not others abase, and depresse it too low, to thinke it is derived from Parents; it comes not of their substance: it is enough for them to be <hi>the fathers of the flesh, God alone is the Father of spirits,</hi> as the Apostle makes the antithesis, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9. <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 9.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the Image, the soule is most like God; saith <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;</hi>

                  <p>First in respect of the substance, being not only a spirituall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall, <note place="margin">1.

                  <p>Secondly, in the Kingdome of grace, the price of the soule is <note place="margin">2. By g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</note> as that the whole Creation is not able to discharge it; <hi>It is not got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for gold, nor silver is not weighed for the price of it; it is not valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the gold of Ophir, or the precious Onix. It cost more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the soule</hi> of sinfull man: the precious bloud of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Sonne of God; hee could only redeeme it, that at the first created it; <hi>Yee are bought with a price, the precious bloud of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the grace of renovation, nothing is able to cleanse <note place="margin">2. In renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> it from sinne, but the Spirit of God. The Spirit alone must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the understanding, and rectifie the affections, and purifie the will, and sanctifie the conscience, and seale up the Image of God in righteousnesse, and true holinesse. And the soule thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, is as a Garden inclosed, a spirituall Paradise, where the God of heaven delights to dwell, the Spouse of the Beloved, and in the phrase of the Church, <hi>As the Lillie among the thornes, so is my love among the daughters.</hi> Seeing it appeares that the universall World is not able to redeeme, or being redeemed, to renew, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed to paralell the soule; let grace subscribe to that which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concludes, that the soule is of greater value then the whole world.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, for the passage of glory, the contents of the whole U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse are not able to come neere the soule. Saith S. <hi>Bernard</hi> well, <note place="margin">3. By glorie. <hi>Bern.</hi>
                     </note> well it may be busie, and tooke up with other things, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be satiate, and replenished with them. And <hi>Democrates</hi> imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that if there were millions of worlds, it were all one in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the soule for blessednesse. The world is transitorie like the dew of the morning, it fades as the grasse, and as the flower of the field; whereas on the contrarie, the soule of man is the subject of immortalitie, capable of an exceeding, surpassing, eternall weight of glory. For if in the time of grace we b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ld as in a glasse, the glory of the Lord, and <hi>are changed into the same Image, from glory to glory, by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> How resplendant shall the soules of the righteous bee, in the beatificall vision of Gods excellencies? How wonderfull shall that divine capacitie be, that shall be capable of God himselfe for a perpetuall residence? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that the most ancient of dayes shall give fulnesse to the Soule, of knowledge and wisdome, and his sacred Spirit that shall fill it <hi>with the fulnesse of God,</hi> with contentation, and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Trinitie shall be all in all to it. Seeing then the Soule is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, and is the subject of the happinesse, and joyes of heaven, and partner with the glorious Angels in the fruition of the chiefe good, let the sentence of glory joyne to Grace and nature, that the Soule is of greater value then the whole world.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The question is soone resolved, if wee ponder the causes of death. A thousand mortall maladies there are to kill the body, and there are a thousand deadly diseases to destroy the soule. There is no sinne so small, but in the rigour of Gods justice, and in its owne nature, it may damne the soule.</p>
                  <p>When God in the beginning stated man in Paradise, hee gave him a speciall caveate about the tree of knowledge, he gives him a command thus; <hi>In the day thou eatest thou shalt die.</hi> What, for bare eating? No, beloved, but for the sinne, for transgressing so small a Commandement of so great a God. Sinne alone makes a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration betweene God and the soule, and causeth the death of the soule; <hi>The soule that sinnes,</hi> the same <hi>shall die.</hi> It may teach us, that for the time that we live in this world, there is nothing easier then to sinne. There is a tree of Life, and a tree of Knowledge, and by eating of the tree forbidden commeth death: there is a way of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, and a way to destruction; there is a God of salvation, and a ghostly enemie, and by adhering to the principalitie of sinne, a man may lose his owne soule.</p>
                  <p>Is it possible then that a man may lose his soule that is so preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? <note place="margin">Vse.</note> and have we not great reason to try, and to suspect our selves, touching our standing towards God? Is there not a maine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie to seeke the meanes to preserve us in the compasse, and seales of grace? It is lamentable to consider how in bodily disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses men can open their griefe, and seeke for helpe, and send to some learned Physitian. Wee can goe to some noble learned counsell, in case of law. But alas the soule lies wounded in the way, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laden with the grievances and pressures of sin, distracted with the affrightings of a troubled conscience, as if there were no balme in <hi>Gilead,</hi> no Physitian there, as if there were no Minister to afford helpe. There is no seeking abroad: a <hi>Lyon</hi> is pretended to bee <hi>in the way,</hi> and <hi>Solomons</hi> sluggard, <hi>folds his hands to sleepe.</hi> O let not these things be so. <hi>Be not as the horse and mule that have no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi> Neglect not the helpes of your preservation in grace: but be continually watchfull with suspition and jealousie, and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from fleshly lusts that fight against your soules.</hi> The Poet could say, Theeves rise by night to robbe, and kill, and steale, and wilt not thou wake to save thy soule.</p>

God (for the most part) saith Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath alotted to nature all by twos, two hands, two eyes, two feet, two eares; eares, eyes, hands, feet, two of all, that if we chance to mayme one, we can helpe to relieve the necessitie of it by the other: but hee hath given us but one soule, if we lose that, what shift shall wee make for another soule? a piercing contemplation, if wee had grace to consider it. Therefore, O my soule, tender thy selfe as my owne happinesse, if thou be translated to heaven, the body in time shall come thither; <hi>this corruption shall put on incorruption; this mortall, shall put on immortalitie.</hi> Againe, if thou be haled with the fiends to the nethermost hell, the body in time shall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Save thy selfe, and save all; and by wofull consequence, lose thy selfe, and lose all: <hi>For what is a man profited, if hee gaine the whole world, and lose is owne soule.</hi> So much for the second point, the possibilitie of losing a mans soule.</p>
                  <p>Come we to the third, the compossibilitie of outward prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; <note place="margin">3. A man may lose his soule in gaining the world.</note> he may lose his soule, in gaining the whole world. In the diversitie of opinions concerning the chiefe good, some there were that placed it in riches; others in honours; and how ever they differed in their judgements, yet both agreed in this, that they were both deceived. For how ever it cannot be denied, but that riches, and honours, are the blessings of God; yet againe they are no demonstration of a blessed man. Lest any man should take <note place="margin">Note.</note> them to be ill, they are bestowed upon them that are good: lest any man should reckon them for the chiefe good, they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed likewise upon the evill: externall blessings are but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon favours vouchsafed to good and bad. Was <hi>Abraham</hi> rich? so was <hi>Abimelech.</hi> Was <hi>Iacob</hi> rich? so was <hi>Laban.</hi> Was <hi>David</hi> a King? so was <hi>Saul.</hi> Was <hi>Constantine</hi> an Emperour? so was <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> Salvation depends not on the multitude of riches, or emmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie in place: the tallest Cedar hath the greatest fall; and the fairest houses many times the greatest ruine; and outward prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie unguarded with inward sanctitie, may soone lose the soule.</p>
                  <p>For first, rich men are tainted with covetousnesse, which is a kind <note place="margin">1. Rich men.</note> of secret Idolatrie, <hi>Collos. 3. and covetousnesse which is Idolatrie,</hi> saith <note place="margin">1. Are covetous.</note> the Apostle.</p>
                  <p>If you would know the reason, the more tenaciously a man loves his owne, the lesse devotion he offers to God, you cannot live in the service of Mammon, and of Christ; the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it, <hi>you cannot serve God and Mammon.</hi> If the young man in the Gospell have great possessions; if <hi>Iudas</hi> carry the bagge, if <hi>Demas imbrace the present world;</hi> then farewell Christ, farewell <hi>Paul,</hi> and farewell soule too. So true is the saying of the
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:14764:231"/>
Apostle, <hi>They that will bee rich fall into temptations, and snares, and many foolish, and noysome lusts that drowne men in perdition and destruction.</hi> Where, hee saith not they that <hi>are,</hi> but they that <hi>will bee</hi> rich: It is not simply money, but the <hi>love of money that is the roote of all evill.</hi> Riches are good with a good conscience: but if the soule be infected with avarice, if it savour of that bitter Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quintida, <hi>Death is in the pot,</hi> and <hi>how hardly shall they that have ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches enter into the kingdome of heaven?</hi> For the desire of worldly men, it is as the unsatiable thirst of a dropsie patient: there is no meanes that they leave unattempted, no policie unachieved for the accomplishment of their ends, and advancing of their estate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Balaam</hi> for a bribe will almost curse where the Lord hath bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. <hi>Ziba</hi> for an inheritance (as much as in him lies) will bring his Master within the compasse of treason. <hi>Demostenes</hi> for a little more gold, instead of pleading, will pretend he hath a cold.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, great men are in danger of ambition, and a swelling <note place="margin">2. Ambitious men.</note> inordinately upon their promotion. And the ambitious man is so strangely dazeled with the beames of his owne lustre, <hi>ut imperio,</hi> &amp;c. that in the greatest of his power, he thinkes of nothing but how to be greater, <hi>hee forgets the Lord that made him, and God that raized him out of the mire, to set him with the Princes of the people.</hi> And like that famous foole in his new coate once, he knowes not himselfe.

It is a signe that <hi>Lucifer,</hi> if he long for dainties shall be cast out of heaven. It is a signe that <hi>Adam,</hi> if he desire the Apple shall be cast out of Paradise. It is a signe that <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> if hee glory in Babell, he shall be cast out of his Kingdome. It is a signe that <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> by abusing his promotion, shall be exalted to the gallowes.

Let us see it in some particulars.</p>
                  <p>First, if it be a man that glories in the resplendancie of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and blesseth himselfe in magnifying his estate; a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Kingdomes and Nations; an ingrosser of preferments and dignities; yet</p>

As the Partridge gathereth young that shee</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, having lost his supposed good, hee loseth the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God the chiefe good, the countenance of the beatificall <note place="margin">2.

In his life-time he refused God, being dead God refuseth him: he turned his face from <hi>the poore and needie;</hi> God in his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction eternally turnes his face from him. A losse so exceeding great, that whosoever descends deepest in the meditation of it, yet he shall be at a losse, and to seeke for a full definition of it: For as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> truly affirmes, Though a man tell thee of tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <note place="margin">Chrysost.</note> hells, all is one in comparison of this miserie, to bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded

of blessednesse and glorie, and to bee hated of Christ.</p>
                  <p>But if this be so, what shall we say to further miserie? having <note place="margin">3.

                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, that that is the hell of hells, that nothing may be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">4.

The date of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is out; the day of grace will never dawne againe: the justice is implacable, the fire unquenchable, the worme unsatiable, and all continuall without intermission for ever-more.</p>

Therefore the summe is this; Hath the covetous exchanged his soule for riches; the ambitious for honours: hath he lost it for the riches of <hi>Cressus,</hi> the power of <hi>Alexander;</hi> the Empire of <hi>Augustus;</hi> the glory of the whole world? yet in consideration of The <list>

                        <hi>Vse.</hi> To prevent this miserie betimes.</note> suffer the word of exhortation (brethren) and captiuate your thoughts to the obedience of Jesus Christ. You especially whom God hath blessed above others, concerning the enjoyment of outward, temporall things. If ever you bee desirous to escape the direfull slaughter-house of Hell; to escape those burnings, and those everlasting yellings, while you have time, bethinke your selves of some saving course to flie <hi>from the wrath to come.</hi> And now in time cast up your accounts: take heed lest for the love of
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:14764:233"/>
this present world, you lose your God, the life of your soules. <hi>There is a way that seemes right to a man</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) but the end of it is the manifold wayes of death.</hi> Some Babilonish garment, some <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, some sweet preferment: but if the meanes be unlawfull, if it disturbe conscience, and prejudice the glory of God, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion the destruction of thy soule, then say, <hi>What shall I doe when God shall rise up? and when he shall visit, what shall I answer?</hi> This will be the reckoning of fooles at the last, <hi>What hath pride profited us? and what hath riches brought us?</hi> Surely the gaine will bee no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then what <hi>Promethius</hi> is fabled to have had by <hi>Pandora's</hi> boxe, a place to be tormented. Or what <hi>Hercules</hi> got by <hi>Dianira's</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Such will be the finall issue of all Mammonists, that live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Christians, and under meanes of better reformation, and more sanctification in their wayes; I say this will be the finall issue. The worme of despaire alway gnawing, and never dying; and the flames of eternall <hi>Tophet</hi> never to bee extinguished. Therefore in such a case, if thou tell me thou knowest what thou dost, and what thou gainest. Let me tell thee, thou little knowest thy dammage, and what thou hast lost. Alas, what are the goods of this life, when they are compared: with eternall damnation? and the sweetnesse of imaginarie gaine, what proportion hath it with the bitternesse of so great a losse? Riches have wings, they take their leave, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is transitorie; pleasures flie away: whereas the soule of man is the subject of immortalitie. And thy poore neglected soule must bide by it for an everlasting pledge, and pay the debt.</p>
                  <p>O! then, continue this glory that is nothing; <hi>First seeke Gods kingdome, and the glory of it;</hi> suffer not heaven to stand at so great a distance to thy soule, <hi>tast and see how gracious the Lord is</hi> by one drop of water from that celestiall fountaine; by one crumme from that heavenly table; and then as concerning the things below, thou wilt account them as drosse and dung, in comparison of that joy and peace of conscience. Resolve as <hi>Themistocles,</hi> when hee saw a goodly bootie, hee would not stoupe to take it up: leave these things for the <hi>Children of this world.</hi> But let your care be to please the Lord, and to gaine the peace of a good conscience; <hi>First seeke the kingdome of God, which consists not in meat and drinke; but in righteousnesse, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost.</hi> Remember the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the things of the world; remember how unable the soule is to enjoy hell, and to lose heaven without eternall horrour: and in consideration hereof. Use the <hi>World, as though you used it not;</hi> and use this as a proofe, hide it in a sanctified memorie, and write it in the table of a sanctified conscience, (if it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) <hi>with a pen of Iron, and the point of a Diamond. What is a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited if hee gaine the whole world, and lose his owne soule?</hi>

                  <p>First, the word of preparation or attention, in the first word, <hi>Behold,</hi> which is as it were a Trumpet that sounds before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the great Judge, bidding every one to fit, and prepare himselfe to hold up his hand at the barre, <hi>Behold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly the Person, and that is the Judge himselfe, speaking in the person of the <hi>Angell.</hi> I, Christ Jesus himselfe.</p>

                  <p>Sixtly, and lastly, the quantitie, and the qualitie of the reward inclusively set downe; which is according to the qualitie of the workes: for if the workes be good, there shall be a great, and good reward, but if they be bad, the reward shall be accordingly. The small model of time will not suffer mee to runne over all these particulars: therefore my meditations, and your attention, shall be in one doctrine from the words in generall, and that is this, that</p>
                  <p>Christ Iesus will hasten his comming to Iudgement, to reward the godly with everlasting, and eternall felicities: but the wicked and ungodly, <note place="margin">

                  <p>For the proofe of which doctrine, you may consider these foure things.</p>
                  <p>First of all the certaintie, and celeritie of Christs comming to Judgement.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the signes that prognosticate his comming.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Judgement it selfe.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the end.</p>
                  <p>For the certaintie of Christs comming to judgement, I perswade my selfe that there is none here among you so ignorant, that hee doth not know, or so Atheisticall that he doth not beleeve: you know it is an Article of our beliefe, that he ascended <hi>into heaven, and there hee sits at the right hand of his Father in glorie, and from thence he shall come at the end of the world, to judge both the quicke and the dead.</hi> Therefore I may spare the labour, and the time in any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe of that.</p>

Now concerning the speedinesse of his comming to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <note place="margin">The speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> If so be the day of Judgement was at hand sixteene ages since, as both Christ and his Apostles proclaimed; if then even in Christs dayes the <hi>ends</hi> of the world were come, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 11. If then was the last time,</hi> as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 11 1 Joh. 2. 18. 1 Pet. 4. 7.</note> 18. <hi>If then the end of all things were at hand,</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. can we thinke that now it is farre off? Nay, so sure, and so certaine as God is God, and his Word is truth, and not one jotte nor tittle <hi>thereof shall passe away,</hi> he is neere at hand, <hi>hee will come shortly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, before wee proceed, there lies two stumbling blocks in the <note place="margin">Two heresies concerning Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to judgement. 2 Pet. 3. 3.</note> way, that wee must remove, wherewith many stumble concerning this point. In the time of the Apostles there were two heresies confuted: the one by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> the other by Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3. he wills us to understand, that in <hi>the last dayes there shall come scoffers, men living after their owne lusts,</hi> saying, <note place="margin">1. Confuted by <hi>S.</hi> Peter.</note> 
                     <hi>Where is the promise of his comming?</hi> You preach so much that Christ Jesus is comming to Judgement, and to call every one of us to account for our wayes, our words and actions, but <hi>where is the promise of his comming? for all things continue alike from the beginning of the Creation.</hi> Miserable men! that would be perswaded that the day of Judgement should never come, because it was deferred: but such jesting, and mocking, and scoffing at this great and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble day heretofore used, and indeed now practised in the whole progenie of unbeleevers, it may be an argument to us, that it shall not be deferred; for so saith Saint <hi>Paul, 1 Thes. 5. 3. when they shall say, peace, peace, and safetie, then destruction shall come on them, as tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell on a woman with child, and they shall not escape.</hi>

                  <p>But Saint <hi>Peter</hi> answers these scoffers that asked, <hi>Where is the promise of his comming?</hi> hee gives them two answers; The one in verse 8. the other verse 9.</p>
                  <p>In the eighth verse, he saith Christ deferres not long to come to judgement: for saith he, <hi>one day with the Lord is as a thousand yeares,</hi> &amp;c. alluding to <hi>Psal. 90. 4. A thousand yeares in thy sight, are but as</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 90. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>yesterday, since they passe as a watch in the night.</hi> As if he should say; were it possible for a man to live a thousand yeares; yet those thousand yeares in respect of God, assoone as they are past, they are as one day in respect of men: nay, they are but as a watch of the night; that is, but as three houres. The old Jewes they divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the night into foure Watches, and appointed to each Watch three houres; as may appeare by comparing of these places of Scripture together, <hi>Mat. 14. 24. Num. 14. 25. Luke</hi> 12. 38. So then <note place="margin">Mat. 14. 24. Numb. 14. 25 Luk. 12. 38.</note> the words beare this exposition, <hi>that a thousand yeares in respect of God, are but as one day;</hi> nay, but as a <hi>Watch of the night;</hi> that is, but as three houres. It doth plainly shew to us, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> meant
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:14764:236"/>
not to speake distinctly of a thousand yeares, but of a long time: so that his meaning is, innumerable yeares in respect of God, are but as one day. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> might as well have said 2000. or 3000. or 10000. thousand yeares in respect of God, are but as one day. Thus you have his first answer to those scoffers, that said, <hi>Where is the promise of his comming?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His second answer is in the ninth verse, where the Apostle saith, <hi>The Lord is not slacke concerning his promise. Where is the promise of his comming?</hi> Why, saith the Apostle, <hi>The Lord is not slacke, as we account slacknesse.</hi> For we account them slacke that goe slowly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a worke, but God is not so to bee accounted slacke; but saith the Apostle, <hi>Hee is patient towards us, and would have none perish, but come to repentance.</hi> Then the slacknesse of Christs comming is his patience, because he would give us time to repent, and have us prepared before hee come. O, then beloved, let us not make a mocke as others doe of this patience, but while we have time, let us take time, that when he comes we may be worthy of him. Thus you have the first heresie confuted.</p>
                  <p>The second was quite contrarie to this, set abroach by certaine false teachers, who taught the Thessalonians, that the day of <note place="margin">2. <hi>By</hi> S. Paul.</note> Judgement was so neere, that it should happen in their age. Where (by the way) you may take notice of the exceeding great subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Divell, that labours by all meanes possible to bring men to one of these extreames. Either that the day of Judgement shall never come, or it shall come in such a limited time and age. And indeed it is ranked among the opinions of some, that held that the day of judgement should be just 6000. yeares after the Creation, 2000. before the Law, 2000. under the Law, and 2000. under the Gospell. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> answers these false teachers among the Thessalonians, and all of the like opinion: therefore to arme <note place="margin">1 Thes. 2.</note> them against their assaults, he bids them for a certainetie beleeve it. 2 <hi>Thessal. 2. that the day of judgement was not at hand.</hi> And hee gives the reason verse 3. <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>that day shall not come, except there be a departing first, and that man of sinne, the sonne of perdition bee revealed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how is it that the Apostle tells the Thessalonians, that the <note place="margin">Object.</note> day of Judgement was not at hand, seeing it is plaine in the places before recited, that the end of the world was at hand, and that now was the last times? and <hi>Heb. 9. 26. Christ appeared in the end of the world.</hi> It was in the end of the world that Christ appeared to <note place="margin">Heb. 26.</note> sacrifice himselfe for our sinnes; how is it then that he tells the Thessalonians here, that the day of the Lord is not at hand?</p>
                  <p>Master <hi>Calvin</hi> saith the answer is easie: for, saith he, in respect of God it was at hand, but as for us, we must be continually wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Answ.</note> for it. But Master <hi>Beza,</hi> and <hi>Rollock</hi> give another Exposition,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:14764:236"/>
which I take to be more naturall to the place: for, say they, in all those places where it seemes to be avouched, <hi>that the day of the Lord is at hand:</hi> they understand the word in the Originall, to signifie generally a time drawing neere. As to say the day of Judgement may be this day as well as to morrow, and to morrow as well as this day; and many dayes hence as well as now. But in that place where he saith it is not at hand, they understand the word precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be meant of a precise time: so the Apostle speakes truly, the day of Judgement is not at hand, so as that any man can say, it shall bee this day, or this moneth, or this houre, or this yeare, or this age. This is no more but the doctrine of Christ; <hi>Of that day, and houre no man knoweth, no not the Angels in heaven; no, not Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe as man, but the Father only.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So you see it is plaine and evident, that the day of Judgement is at hand; but in what precise limits of time or age it shall happen, it is uncertaine. Our Saviour Christ tells his Apostles, <hi>Act. 1. 7. It is not</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 1. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>for you to know the times, and seasons, that the Father hath put into his own hands.</hi> It is not for you to know these times: Then beloved, why should we have an eare to heare, where God hath not a tongue to speake? Let it suffice us to know that it is at hand, which if wee make good use of, it will make us warie and watchfull, and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant over all our wayes; that we say not with the evill servant, <hi>Our Master deferres his comming;</hi> let us eate, and drinke, and beat our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low servants: but betake our selves to the good servants dutie, <hi>to watch.</hi> Watch we therefore, <hi>wee know not the day and houre, when the Sonne of man commeth.</hi> But when he commeth and findes us do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, dealing faithfully, and living holily; happy, nay thrice happie shall we be: we shall bee sure to partake of the blessing of those upon mount <hi>Gerrazim,</hi> we need not feare the curse of those upon Mount <hi>Eball.</hi> Wee need not bee afraid of the Thundering, and lightning on <hi>Sinai,</hi> nor the fire, and tempest, nor smoake of the furnace, nor of the sound of the Trumpet: for all our joy shall be in Sion.</p>
                  <p>But when he comes, if he find us living wickedly, dealing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfully, cursed, nay, thrice cursed we be, we are sure to partake of mourning for joy, of ashes for beautie, of a rent for a girdle: whatsoever becomes of our garments, assuredly our hearts shall be rent in sunder. <hi>Watch wee therefore, wee know not the day and houre, when the Sonne of man will come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the second place, that the children of God may bee armed, <note place="margin">2. Signe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> and prepared for his comming, hee hath set downe in his Word, certaine signes which being effected, and come to passe; they may easily judge, that then <hi>the day of redemption draweth nigh.</hi> Now these signes are of three sorts. <note place="margin">Of three sorts.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some are in respect of us a long time before he comes to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="454" facs="tcp:14764:237"/>
A second sort are immediatly before his comming.</p>
                  <p>The third, in his comming.</p>
                  <p>The signes that prognosticate his comming long before are these; <note place="margin">1. Long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First of all the preaching of the Gospell to the whole world, <note place="margin">1. The preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to all the world. Mat. 24. 14.</note> which is set downe by Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 14. <hi>The Gospell of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome shall bee preached to the whole world, for a testimonie to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; then shall the end bee.</hi> Which words of our Saviour Christ we are not so to understand, as that the Gospell should be preached to the whole world at any one time: for that never was; nor I thinke never will be: but if we so understand it, that the Gospell shall be preached to all Nations successively, and at severall times: then if wee consider the times since the Apostles, wee shall find that the sound of the Gospell hath gone out to all the Nations of the world, as it was spoken by the Prophet: so that this first signe is already past, the end cannot be farre.</p>
                  <p>The second signe is, the revealing of Antichrist, saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, 2 <hi>Thessal.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>That day shall not come, except there bee a departing,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Thereves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. 2 Thes. 2. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>and that man of sinne, the sonne of perdition, which is Antichrist bee revealed.</hi> Concerning this signe, in the yeare of our Lord 602. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ; S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> seemeth to avouch, that whosoever taketh the name of universall Bishop, and Pastor of the Church, that was Antichrist. Five yeares after, <hi>Boniface</hi> succeeding him, by <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour, had the title of Universall Bishop of the Church, and ever since, all their successours have taken that name: so that it is evident that at <hi>Rome</hi> hath beene, and now is, the Antichrist; so that the second signe being fulfilled, the end cannot be farre.</p>
                  <p>The third is the generall departure of the most from the Faith. <note place="margin">3. Generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the faith.</note> There hath beene a generall departure in former times: when <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> spread his heresies, almost all the whole world became an Arian: and for the space of 500 yeares together, from the time of <hi>Boniface,</hi> the world was so infected with Popish heresies, that the faith of Christ could scarsely be discerned; they were as a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of wheate to a great deale of chaffe; so that this signe it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fulfilled in part; but there shall alway be a falling away, and a departing from the faith till Christ come to judgement.</p>
                  <p>The fourth signe stands in exceeding great corruption in the manners of men. And the Apostle makes this a signe of Christs <note place="margin">4. Corruption in manners. 2 Tim. 3.</note> last comming to judgement, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>This know, that in the last dayes perillous times shall come, men shall be lovers of themselves, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unholy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out naturall affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitours, headie, high-minded, lovers of pleasures, more then lovers of God.</hi> The Apostle makes this a signe and marke, that shall bee in the last dayes. Beloved, if ever this
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:14764:237"/>
were fulfilled, it is fulfilled in these dayes of ours: for there is a generall corruption in the manners of men. It is very hard to find those that in all truth and sinceritie, labour to discharge a good conscience towards God and men. And Christ hath said himselfe, that when hee comes to judgement, hee shall scarse find <hi>faith on earth;</hi> such a generall corruption there shall bee in the manners of men: so that this fourth signe being already past, the end cannot be farre.</p>
                  <p>The fift signe is exceeding great persecution, and affliction of <note place="margin">5. Persecution of the Church.</note> the Church, and the Saints of God. This hath beene fulfilled in former times. You know there were ten fearfull persecutions in the Primitive Church. And so it is fulfilled even in these dayes of ours: for the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that spotted beast, shee laboureth to make her selfe drunke with the bloud of Gods Saints. There are but few yeares, nay, moneths, or weeks, wherein some of the bloud of Gods Saints is not sacrificed to appease the wrath of the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors. Then if in these dayes, this signe be fulfilled, the end can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be farre.</p>
                  <p>The sixt is a generall securitie, so that men will not be moved, <note place="margin">6. Generall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie.</note> neither with the preaching of the word of God, nor yet with judgements from heaven: they have such exceeding dulnesse and deadnesse of heart, that neither of these will move them.</p>
                  <p>For the former, you know God hath sent many judgements amongst us; we have had fire, and famine, and pestilence, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion of forreine enemies; inundation of waters, thunder and lightning from heaven; but all these will not worke upon our hearts. The Lord he hath scourged us oft, but yet we set light by his corrections, we harden our hearts against all his judgements, our hearts will not be softned, and molified; what effect hath all these wrought, where is our humiliation, our repentance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
                  <p>And for the preaching of the word of God, alas that can get no entrance at all: mens hearts are so crustie, and so hardened, that the seed of Gods word it lies uncovered, it takes no roote at all in the heart; it workes no reformation at all: so that if ever this signe were fulfilled, it is in these dayes. It shall be saith Christ speaking of the generall securitie that shall bee, when hee comes to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>as in the dayes of Noah and of Lot, they were eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and marrying, and giving in marriage,</hi> till the fire came from heaven and burned them, and the water over-flowed the world: so that this sixt signe being past, the end cannot be farre.</p>
                  <p>The seventh and last signe of Christs comming to Judgement, <note place="margin">7. Calling of the Jewes.</note> is the calling of the Jewes, which the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25. calls the fulfilling of the Gentiles. When God hath the number of his Elect among the Gentiles, then the Jewes shall bee called againe:
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:14764:238"/>
but of the time, and the manner, and number, the word of God doth not reveale it: so that it is likely this signe is yet to come, all the rest are fulfilled, and therefore the end cannot be farre.</p>
                  <p>The second sort of signes, are such as are immediatly before Christs comming to Judgement, and that is the darknesse of the <note place="margin">2. Signes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly before Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> Sunne, Moone, and Starres. <hi>The Sunne shall bee darkned, the Moone shall lose her light; the Starres shall fall from heaven, the very powers of heaven shall bee shaken, the foundations of the heavens shall tremble.</hi> Alas, what shall the little shrubbes in the Wildernesse doe, when the tall Cedars of heaven shall bee shaken? What shall poore sinfull man doe, when the Angels shall be afraid?</p>
                  <p>The last signe shall be in Christs comming to Judgement, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 29. it is called, <hi>the signe of the Sonne of man; Then shall appeare</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. In Christs comming.</note> 
                     <hi>the signe of the Sonne of man; and then all the tribes of the earth shall mourne.</hi> What this signe of the Sonne of man is, Divines doe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Some hold it is the signe of the Crosse, which all eyes shall behold, <hi>even they that pierced him,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. <note place="margin">Revel. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some others (which I rather assent unto) take it to be the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious beames of Christs Majestie, immedeiatly before his perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall appearance to enlighten the world, being darkned, by reason of the want of the light of the Sunne and Moone. So you see what these signes shall be. The signes that prognosticate Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. Those that shall be fulfilled long before, they are all effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but one, as you heard. Therefore it stands us all upon, as wise Virgins, to prepare oyle in our lampes, that when our Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome Christ shall come, we may be ready to enter into eternall joy. So we come from the signes that prognosticate the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the Judgement it selfe.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Judgement it selfe; You must know that after <note place="margin">2. The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentit selfe.</note> death there are two judgements;
There is a particular, and there is a generall <note place="margin">Two Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> Judgement.</p>
                  <p>The particular Judgement is immediatly, as soone as ever the breath is gone out of the body. As soone as ever the soule is <note place="margin">1. Particular.</note> gone out of the body, it is conducted by the Angels before the Tribunall seat of God, and there receives the particular sentence, either of joy or torment, according as it lived in the body in this life. We need not speake of this; we have example for the proofe of it in Scripture, of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the one whereof being dead, was presently carried to joy, the other presently to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The other is a generall judgement; so called, because it shall <note place="margin">2. Generall.</note> be of all men in generall that ever lived, and breathed upon the face of the earth, men, women, and children; all shall be presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:14764:238"/>
before the Tribunall seat of Christ; all must hold up their hands at the Barre of his judgement; all must give an account of all their words, thoughts, and actions: all must receive the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence either of <hi>Come yee blessed, or goe yee cursed.</hi> After which sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence once pronounced, there shall never question bee made, of the end of the joy of the one, or of the ease of the torments of the other.</p>
                  <p>But here ariseth a question; you know the world consists but <note place="margin">Quest.</note> of two sorts of persons, beleevers, and unbeleevers. For the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever it is evident and plaine, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>Hee is passed alreadie from</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>death to life;</hi> he hath everlasting life already; he shall not come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to judgement. And for the unbeleever it is as plaine, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 18. that <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 18.</note> he is already condemned, even already: both are judged already, both the beleever and unbeleever; the beleever is saved already, the unbeleever is damned already, what need therefore a generall; a second Judgement?</p>
                  <p>To this I answer, that there is a very great need of it, both in <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Necessitie of a day of judgement.</note> respect of the justice, and of the mercie of God, whose propertie it is alway to reward the godly, and to punish the wicked, which seeing he doth not to the full in this life, it must needes bee that a day will come that he will fully doe it.</p>
                  <p>You know the course of the Lord, as <hi>David</hi> speakes; good men have bands in their death, and wicked men are Iustie and strong; good men are in evill condition; and wicked men in prosperitie. <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Cinnick, seeing <hi>Harpalus</hi> a theefe long in prosperitie; he was bold to say, that wicked <hi>Harpalus</hi> his living long in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, it was an argument to <hi>Diogenes,</hi> that God had cast off his care of the world, that he respected not mens affaires. And indeed the prosperitie of the wicked, hath brought the Saints of God to a stand. <hi>Davids</hi> foot slipped almost in seeing the prosperitie of the <note place="margin">Psal. 37. Iob 24. 12.</note> wicked. It made <hi>Iob</hi> to say, <hi>Iob</hi> 24. 12. <hi>Men groane out of the Citie by reason of oppression, and the soules of the slaine crie out; and yet God chargeth them not with folly.</hi> This made <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> to expostulate his cause with the Lord, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 12. <hi>Let mee talke with thee of thy</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>judgements, Why doth the wicked prosper, and they that transgresse thy commandements?</hi> This makes the godly take up that passionate complaint, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 11. How doth God know it? <hi>is there any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 73. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>in the most high?</hi> Certainly, we have cleansed our hearts in vaine; in vaine wee have <hi>washed our hands in innocencie:</hi> in vaine we labour to live godly lives; Why? <hi>Every day wee are chastened:</hi> for the Lord corrects us every morning. And these have the wealth of the world, they have the world at will. Wee in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie know this to be true. <hi>Dives</hi> hath the world at will, while poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> is shut out of dores, hungrie and thirstie, cold and naked, full of necessitie every way. This being so, the day must
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:14764:239"/>
needes come, that the one shall have fulnesse of glory, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of miserie.</p>
                  <p>But to answer those places before cited. To the former <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. where it is said, <hi>The beleever is passed already from death to life;</hi> hee hath everlasting life alreadie. It is true, hee is passed already from death to life, by faith he hath it already, and by hope; he shall not come into judgement; that is, of condemnation, (so we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it,) but there is a judgement of absolution that is to bee executed; and so when the Lord Jesus Christ shall descend from heaven with the sound of a Trumpet, <hi>and the voyce of the Archangell, then the dead in Christ shall rise first, and bee caught up in the cloudes to meet Christ,</hi> and then they shall be set at his right hand, and heare that heavenly sentence; <hi>Come yee blessed of my Father, inherite the kingdome prepared for you, before the beginning of the world.</hi> You see the answer to that, that beleevers shall not come into judgement; that is, not the judgement of condemnation, but of absolution at the last day.</p>
                  <p>Now for the other place, where it is said, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 18. the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever <note place="margin">Vnbeleever condemned already how.</note> is condemned alreadie.</p>
                  <p>It is true, he is condemned already, and that three wayes.</p>
                  <p>First of all, hee is condemned already in the counsell of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he is condemned already in the word of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he is condemned already in his owne conscience.</p>
                  <p>First, in the counsell of God, God hath made an eternall decree of Predestination, whereby he hath elected some to salvation, and predestinated them thereto, and others to damnation. In this Gods eternall decree, the unbeleever is alreadie condemned: nay, before ever he came into the world, as you have it in the example of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> and <hi>Esau, Rom.</hi> 9. before ever they had done good or evill, God hated the one, and loved the other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the word of God hee is condemned, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 18. Why? because he hates the light, and loves darknesse.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in his owne conscience he is condemned: for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall horrour thereof gives him no rest, day nor night; there is a worme continually gnawing there, and a sting tormenting him: but the full execution thereof is to be in the day of wrath, when he shall be set at the left hand of Christ, and heare the sentence, <hi>Goe yee cursed into eternall fire, prepared for the divell and his angells.</hi> O, what a terrible day will this be to all the wicked workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie: for Christ Jesus the Judge shall come then, to give them their reward. This shall be a blacke, a sad, a wofull, dismall day to them: they shall not be able to looke on the Judge, he shall bee so terrible to them. You see the terriblenesse of the Judge set downe by Saint <hi>Iohn, Revel.</hi> 20. 10, 11. where it is said, <hi>hee saw a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Revel. 20. 10, 11.</note>

and earth, and their place was no more found.</hi> Heaven and earth are great and mightie creatures, insensible creatures, that have not sinned, they flie, and tremble, and hide themselves at the comming of the great Judge: and shall man, silly sinfull man, thinke to stand before the Judge without trembling? Indeed if a man could present himselfe spotlesse without blame, he needed not to feare, but a las it is farre otherwise, there is none that doth good, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, saith <hi>Solomon.</hi> The most righteous before men are stained, and poluted in the sight of God; and may crie with the Leper, <hi>Uncleane, uncleane, what is man that hee should be pure? or the sonne of man, that hee should bee just with God?</hi> The Angels of heaven are impure in his sight, <hi>how much more filthy man, that drinketh iniquitie</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job 15. Psal. 14. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>as water,</hi> Job 15. So in <hi>Psal. 14. 2. When God lookes downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon the sonnes of men, to see if there were any that would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and seeke after God;</hi> Will he find any that frames themselves according to the rule of perfection that hee requires? surely no; but this he findes, they are all corrupt, and abominable in their doings, <hi>there is none that doth good; no, not one:</hi> so sinfull is man in his whole race: sinfull in his conception, he is conceived in sinne, before ever hee sees light in this world, when hee is covered with the rich hangings of natures wardrobe in his mothers womb, then man tumbles in sinne, as the word in the originall signifieth. Hee is sinfull in his birth, in his life, in his thoughts, his words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and shall he that is thus spotted, and stained, and polluted, stand before the pure Judge of heaven and earth without trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling? surely no; <hi>The mightie, the Kings of the earth, the Captaines, high, and low, of what condition soever;</hi> as many as have not made their garments white in the bloud of the slaughtered Lambe Christ, they shall tremble, and flie to hide themselves; and <hi>crie to the mountaines to cover them,</hi> before the face of this glorious Judge.</p>
                  <p>Wee come now to the last thing, and that is the end of Christs <note place="margin">4. The end of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> comming to Judgement. The end of Christs comming you know is to give a reward. And this reward shall be both to the wicked, and to the godly: for hee shall give the reward according to every mans worke.</p>
                  <p>First, I will speake of the reward of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>And after conclude with the reward of the godly.</p>
                  <p>The reward of the wicked shall be endlesse woe, and perpetuall <note place="margin">The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked.</note> miserie in hell. There was never any man that descended into that fierie lake, and returned thence to tell us, what torments are provided for the wicked in Hell: but yet as by one drop of the Sea water, you may conceive of the saltnesse of the rest; and as a man may ghesse at the stature of a Giant, by the length of his foot; even so wee may have some conceit of those endlesse and easelesse, and remedilesse torments prepared for the wicked in
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:14764:240"/>
hell, by a taste of the miseries we have in this life. Great may the griefe of a mans heart be, even in this life, as great as mortalitie is able to beare. Can we read of the mourning of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> of <hi>Iob,</hi> of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and not bee moved? our hearts are hard. Can we reade of the hideous torments invented by Tyrants, Caldrons of boyling oyle, roasting upon spits, tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling downe Mountaines in barrels of nayles, rending of joynts with horses; can we reade of these mercilesse torments, and not be moved? our hearts are harder then a milstone. Alas, beloved, these are nothing but shadowes, but counterfeit to those torments that are prepared for the wicked in hell. For though the bowels of hell labour to emptie the bowels of judgement, yet shee hath an immeasurable portion for her children now living; nay, for those that are unborne, a patrimonie of blacknesse, of brimstone, of the wrath of God, of wailing, and gnashing of teeth. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, death shall take them away, but they shall never die; they shall consume for ever, and yet shall not be consumed; they shall be in fire unquenchable, and yet see no light. You may reade of <hi>the wine of giddinesse, Psal.</hi> 60. 3. of a strange kind of <hi>Worme, Isay</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 60. 3. Isay ult. Ezek. 28. 22. Rev. 14. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>ult.</hi> of fire and brimstone, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38. 22. of the <hi>Wine-presse of Gods wrath, Revel.</hi> 14. 10. All these, and if worse then these can be, are prepared as so many torments for the wicked workers of iniquitie. Their cuppe is the deadliest that ever was drunke, even of Gods wrath wherewith they shall bee filled for ever; their worme is that that continually gnawes upon the conscience: they shall bee tormented in fire and brimstone, before the Lambe and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: Not such as that of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> for then there were hope that they might be converted at the last into heapes of Ashes, or pooles of Pitch; but such fire and brimstone, that as a bottomlesse Mine gives them rest neither night nor day, the smoake of it ascending for ever; and is appointed for a time, and times, till time shall be no more. Their torment in such a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, <hi>as neither eye hath seene, nor eare heard, nor heart of man hath conceived.</hi> But, beloved, all this is but generall; if the time would suffer, we could shew the torments of the damned in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as</p>
                  <p>First, the eternitie of those torments, in that they shall never <note place="margin">Eternitie of the torment of the wicked.</note> end; and I verily perswade my selfe, that this is a great increase of their torments, the very conceit and thought that they shall never end, it is a great increase and aggravation of the torment. You know there is no griefe and sorrow, or miserie in this life, but time will either deminish it, or take it quite away; either the tormented, or the tormentor will die: but in hell there you have them tormented day and night, for ever and ever, neither the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, or the tormentor die, but they live to endlesse woe.
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:14764:240"/>
O! saith a godly Father in his meditations, if a wicked sinner in hell did know that he were to continue there no more thousands of yeares, then there are sands upon the Sea-shore, or no more milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Ages, then there are piles of grasse upon the ground, yet this would be some comfort, that at last they should have an end; but this word <hi>never,</hi> it breakes the heart, that after they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there so many thousand yeares, and millions of ages, they are as farre from the end of their torment as at the first.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we might note here againe the extremitie, and strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <note place="margin">Extremitie of torments.</note> of those torments, the straitnesse of them, there is no mercy shewed; <hi>Take him, and bind him hand and foot, and cast him into ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darknesse.</hi> And againe, the gate is shut, after the sinner is once cast into hell, there is no getting out againe, the gate is shut.</p>
                  <p>The straitnesse of these torments may bee exceedingly layd downe to us, in the Parable of the rich glutton; who in hell, roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in everlasting flames, lift up his eyes, and saw <hi>Abraham</hi> a-farre off, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his bosome; hee desired <hi>Abraham</hi> to send <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> but to dippe the toppe of his finger in water, to coole his tongue: a small request: hee askes not to bee delivered from his torments; or for a flaggon of water, but for a droppe; yet to see the strictnesse of those torments, it was denied him. <hi>Dives</hi> had before, the world at will, what his heart could desire: but <hi>Lazarus</hi> comes to his gate full of soares and hungrie, yet hee refused to refresh him with crummes from his table; see the just judgement of God against the mercilesse wretch. <hi>Dives</hi> refused to give a crumme; when he asked he is denied one drop. So that as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speakes, <hi>Iam. 2. there shall be judgement mercilesse to them that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iam. 2:</note> 
                     <hi>yeeld no mercie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beloved, all you that have the wealth of the world remember this example, when the poore distressed members of Christ come to your gates, shutte not up the bowels of compassion, open your hands, and your hearts to relieve them: for as I said before, <hi>there shall bee judgement mercilesse to those that shew no mercie.</hi> But I come <note place="margin">The reward of the godly.</note> to the last thing that I will but only name; that is, the reward of the godly, that everlasting, eternall felicitie in heaven. The time will not suffer mee to speake largely, and particularly of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the godly, which is a great incouragement, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the servants of God. I will only speake in generall. The Prophets when they speake of the Kingdome of Christ, they set it out by good things; there is no need of their good things; <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall not rise against Nation, they shall breake their speares into mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isay 2.</note> 
                     <hi>The wolfe shall dwell with the lambe, and the Leopard with the</hi>

                     <hi>Kidde; They shall eate of the tree of life, and the hidden Manna there. They shall bee made pillers in the Temple of God.</hi> There they shall be cloathed with <hi>long whiterobes.</hi> Which places take us by the hand,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:14764:241"/>
and bring us to some conceit of those joyes.</p>
                  <p>How then doth it stand every one upon now, while wee have time, to labour to have interest in those joyes? Thrice happy is that man or woman, that comes to enjoy those joyes. It is spoken of Christ, that hee, the joyes of heaven being set before him, <hi>hee susteined the crosse.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> accounted all but <hi>dung that hee might winne Christ,</hi> and come to those joyes. And <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> saith, that breaking of bones, fire, and gallowes, quartering of limbes, come what will, so I may come to those joyes. I would wee had all the like zeale after those joyes. Our cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in seeking those joyes come from a base esteeme of them for if wee did esteeme them, wee would labour exceedingly after them.</p>
                  <p>Many things for use might be inferred hence. As first here is <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Comfort.</note> comfort, and incouragement to all the Saints of God, the servants of Christ, that take paines to live a godly life. However here they indure afflictions, and mockings, and reproaches, and scoffes of the world, yet Christ hath a great reward for them. Let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, great shall their reward be. Give me a man then that hath buckled with the sinnes of the times, that hath studied the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Religion; give mee such a one as hath incouraged those that are feeble, that hath provided for the Lords Prophets, that hath reformed the abuses of the Lords day as <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> what will inflame his zeale more then this, that Christ his Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our sees it, and regards it, and will reward him? And lest hee should faint before the reward come, he saith, he will come short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This comforted <hi>Elias</hi> in the Wildernesse, and <hi>Ieremiah</hi> in the Dungeon, and <hi>Iob</hi> on the Dunghill; so that <hi>they were more then conquerours through Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, is it so that Christ will come to Judgement, and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Terrour to the wicked. Mal. 4. 1.</note> hath his reward with him; here is terrour to all the wicked wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of iniquitie. <hi>Behold,</hi> saith <hi>Malachie,</hi> Mal. 4. 1. <hi>The day of the Lord commeth, it shall burne as an oven, and all the wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly of the earth, shall bee as stubble and straw, and fuell for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of Gods wrath.</hi> What a wofull and heavie day will this be to all the wicked and ungodly? Me thinkes they might conceive the terrour, and they shall crie out at the last day, when hee shall come to reward them: is not this he whose lawes wee have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned? whose sides wee have pierced? whom wee have nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Crosse: whose Ministers wee haue reviled? whose servants wee have reproached? And this shall strike great terrour to the hearts of all wicked men, when Christ shall pronounce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, <hi>Goe yee cursed.</hi> Whither? <hi>to the divell and his place of torments: Then they shall crie to the mountaines to fall on them:</hi> Oh that some wilde beast would follow them, and teare them in
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:14764:241"/>
peeces, but it will be too late: their part and portion is in that <hi>Lake that burnes with fire and brimstone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, this should stirre every one up to fit himselfe, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3. To be fitted for the day.</note> for this judgement. And let us continually therefore lift up our hearts to heaven; and as the Apostle speakes, waite for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of Christ to Judgement. Then all teares shall bee wiped from our eyes: there shall bee no more sorrow, and mourning: there we shall sit with the Saints, and sing with the Angels, <hi>Halelujah, halelujah, all praise, and honour, and glorie, and might, and dominion, and majestie, bee to him that is upon the throne;</hi> the Lambe Christ Jesus for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He former Verses you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I chose to speake of upon another occasion.</p>
                  <p>I shewed you how the grace of God, that brought salvation to all men; appeared.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, how it teacheth those men to whom it brings salvation. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man would be glad to bee saved by grace, but they love not that grace should teach them: now grace saveth none, but whom it teacheth; it first teacheth them, and then saveth them. Now it teacheth us as the Apostle saith, three lessons.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>quid vitandum,</hi> what wee are to shunne: <hi>ungodlinesse, and worldly lusts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then secondly it teacheth us, <hi>quid faciendum,</hi> what wee are to doe, <hi>to live soberly, and justly, and piously in this present world.</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:14764:244"/>
toward ourselves; righteously toward our neighbour; and piously towards God, this is the second lesson.</p>
                  <p>Then it teacheth us a third lesson, <hi>quid expectandum,</hi> what wee must looke for; <hi>looking,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>for the blessed hope, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Iesus Christ.</hi> The two first points I handled then. And I told you I would reserve the third point, till it pleased God to give me a fit occasion.</p>
                  <p>It hath pleased God to give me a fit one, but a very sad occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; It is the Lord, <hi>let him doe what seemeth good in his eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will goe over the words in particular, and observe something out of them. And then out of all together, I will raise this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that</p>
                  <p>A child of God must live so soberly, so justly, so godly in this present world, as becommeth a man that lookes for a more blessed hope, at the great day, at the appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Iesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>I begin with the first. The first word is <hi>Looking,</hi> and it hath in it these foure things; <note place="margin">Looking foure things in it.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, earnestnesse: a Saint of God must looke, and looke earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Apostle when hee sets downe the looking of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <note place="margin">1. Earnestnesse.</note> (for the creatures looke too together with us, to bee <hi>freed from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious libertie of the sonnes of God;</hi> when he speakes of the looking of the creature) hee useth a strange word which signifieth a putting out of the head, looking to see what it can espie a great way off, to see if there be any signe of his comming, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 19. And he tells us that the creature doth not <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 19.</note> only put out the head and looke, but waites, and groanes, and sighes, and travelleth as a woman in paine: and quoth the Apostle, <hi>not only the creatures doe thus, but wee that have the first fruits of the spirit.</hi> Nay, if the creature put out the head, and groane, and waite, and is in paine till that day come, how much more should we that have the first fruits of the spirit? Earnestnesse, that is one.</p>
                  <p>A second thing is Patience. <hi>If</hi> (quoth the Apostle) <hi>wee hope</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Patience.</note>

                  <p>First of all, that the time is not knowne to us, when this Lord will appeare. <hi>It is not for you to know the times and the seasons, that</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And considering secondly, that that time, either longer or shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">2. It seemes long.</note> may seeme to be long, <hi>omnes celeritas in desiderio;</hi> All hast that

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, considering, (as the very heathen man could call <note place="margin">3. Gods strange working.</note> them) those wondrous workings of God. It is many times seene, that Gods working seemes to goe against his word.</p>
                  <p>And then fourthly, considering how busie the Divell is to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit the truth of Gods promise, and to weaken our faith, I say againe with the Apostle, <hi>you have need of patience.</hi> There is the second thing.</p>

                  <p>Lastly, this looking hath also with it, a care and diligence to <note place="margin">4. Diligence.</note> prepare our selves against that comming. Marke the Apostle 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 14. saith the Apostle, <hi>Seeing wee looke for these things, let us</hi>

So then where this excellent looking for this blessed hope is, there will be all these;</p>
                  <p>An earnestnesse first,</p>
                  <p>And then a Patience,</p>
                  <p>And then a Joy.</p>
                  <p>And then a diligence to meet him, to make our selves readie for him.</p>
                  <p>Doest thou not looke earnestly?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A freedome</hi> from all ill, both of soule and body.</p>
                  <p>And a fruition of all good, both in soule, and body, in the whole man.</p>

                     <pb n="470" facs="tcp:14764:245"/>
First, this <hi>blessed hope</hi> consists in this, in a freedome from all ill. <note place="margin">1. In freedome from all ill.</note> First, that there shall bee no more blindnesse in our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; no more rebellion in our wills; no more terrour in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; no more weaknesse in our memorie; no more sinne, no more power to sinne; here is a <hi>non posse pecari.</hi> No more tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Satan; no more allurements of the world; no more frailties of the flesh; no more hunger, no more thirst, no more wearinesse, no more sicknesse; no more megrome in the head, no more palsie in the hand; no more goute in the feet; no more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases, and no more death. For if we shall be freed from corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; how much more shall wee be freed from vexation, and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and deformitie.

                  <p>Well, here is not all; it is not enough to be freed from ill: but <note place="margin">2. To enjoy all good.</note> here is the second part of this <hi>blessed hope,</hi> to enjoy all good.</p>
                  <p>First, this is our blessed hope, that the Image of God shall bee wondrously perfected in our soules; and all the faculties of it. This is our hope that God shall be to our understandings fulnesse of light: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>hat he shall be to our wills abundance of peace; to our memories a continuation of eternitie. In a word, God shall bee <hi>All in all.</hi> This is our <hi>blessed hope,</hi> that this <hi>vile body of ours,</hi> as vile as it is (as the Apostle calls it, <hi>a body of vilenesse)</hi> it shall bee raised up againe, and made like the glorious body of Christ by that <hi>mightie working: that this corruptible shall put on incorruption,</hi> and this very <hi>mortall, shall put on immortalitie.</hi> I, and this is the <hi>blessed hope,</hi> that both in soule and body being blessed, we shall be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together to the <hi>Congregation of the first borne.</hi> Where wee are sure never to find any enemie, and wee are sure never to lose a friend. Where we shall have the societie, and company of Gods Saints, and of the blessed Angels. And in the beatificall vision and fruition, and communion of God, we shall have such joy, as <hi>neither eye hath seene, nor eare hath heard, nor tongue can expresse:</hi> such joy as cannot be conceived, and shall never be ended.</p>
                  <p>Oh, blessed be that God, that is the author of this hope; and blessed is the man that is partakers of this hope.</p>
                  <p>But when will this be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for quoth the Apostle, <hi>If our hope were only in this life, of all men</hi> living, <hi>wee were most miserable.</hi> Why, but when must we looke for it then?
<q>At the appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Iesus Christ.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the glorious appearing. The word is at the <hi>Epiphanie,</hi> at the appearance of glory, at the glorious appearing.

                     <pb n="471" facs="tcp:14764:245"/>
There was no glory, in the first <hi>Epiphanie,</hi> and appearing of <note place="margin">1. In the flesh in humilitie.</note> Christ. It was no glorie for the Creator, to become a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for the Lord, to become a servant; for the Word to become an infant. Hee was our joy, and yet hee sorrowed; hee was our strength, and yet he was weakened: hee was our confidence, and yet he feared: he was our Saviour, and yet he suffered: he was our life, and yet he died. There was no glory in that. Hee came to be <hi>minor Patre, lesse then his Father:</hi> but that is not all, yet hee might have become a glorious creature, as the Angels are glorious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. No, it was lesse then thus; hee was a little lower then the Angels, in that he was made man. But in that he suffered, he was a great deale lesse then a man: hee was a little lesse then an Angell, in that he was made man, but in that hee suffered, hee was a great deale lesse then a man. For what was he? harke what <hi>David</hi> saith in his person, <hi>I am a worme and no man, the verie off-scouring of men,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>the out-cast of the people:</hi> there was no glorie in his first appearing. <note place="margin">2. To judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now his second appearing shall be in glorie, it shall be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way glorious.</p>
                  <p>First, his Person glorious. <note place="margin">1. His Person.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then his Throne glorious, <hi>hee shall come and sit upon the throne of his glorie.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Throne.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then his attendants glorious, the Angells, <hi>thousand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands</hi>

                     <hi>ministring to him, ten thousand thousands standing before him,</hi> and all glorious.</p>

What glory will he get when he shall throw the Divell, and wicked men into hell fire? there is glory in his administration of justice.</p>
                  <p>Then glorie in his Saints, as the Apostle 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 10. saith, <hi>that</hi>

                     <hi>God shall be marvellous glorious in his Saints. For when Christ that is our glory shall appeare, then wee also shall appeare with him in glorie.</hi> Here is the glorious Epiphanie of Christ, a glorious appearing.</p>
                  <p>But of whom?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The great God, and our Saviour Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some there are that would make these two, to be two persons. <hi>The great God,</hi> say they, that is God the Father; and <hi>our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> that is, God the Sonne. Thus the Arrians; thus the semi-Arrians; and thus (which I wonder at) <hi>Erasmus,</hi> and thus some others.</p>
                  <p>But first of all, you never find in the New Testament of the Epiphanie of God the Father: that same glorious Epiphanie is ever of the Sonne.</p>
                  <p>Then the Greeke makes it plaine me thinkes: for had there been two persons, the Apostle should have said thus, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:14764:246"/>
there should have beene two Articles; but here is but one Article: it is apparant to them that understand the Greeke, it is but one Person; that same person is the mightie God, <hi>the great God, and the Saviour Iesus Christ.</hi>
                     <q>The great God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, Christ is God. I need not stand to prove that now, among <note place="margin">Christ is God.</note> you. And that same incommunicable Name of <hi>Iehova,</hi> by which I find him called in Scripture, and those incommunicable proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Divine Nature.</p>
                  <p>Immortalitie.</p>
                  <p>Immutabilitie,</p>
                  <p>Immensitie.</p>
                  <p>Omnipotencie.</p>
                  <p>Omniscience, which are all ascribed to Christ.</p>
                  <p>And then those names that are proper only to God, as The <list>

                     </list> of the world.</p>
                  <p>And then the worship that is due to God alone, is given to Christ in the Scriptures, <hi>ipsius est, solus est;</hi> all these being given to him, prove him to be God.</p>

one that feared God, and looked for the redemption of the people of God:</hi> he looked for <hi>the kingdome of God.</hi> There was looking then,</p>
                  <p>And the Children of God now in the New Testament, they are all described by this, looking for the second comming of Christ. Gods children are still looking for this second comming. Let me give you but a place or two of Scripture. The Apostle saith <hi>Phil. 3. 20. Our conversation is in heaven, from whence wee looke</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 20. Jude 21.</note> 
                     <hi>for the Saviour.</hi> Saith S. <hi>Iude,</hi> verse 21. <hi>Keepe your selves in the love of God, as men that looke for the mercie of God, at that great day, to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. Gird up your loynes,</hi> saith our blessed Lord, <hi>and let your lights bee burning in your hands,</hi> that you may be as men that looke for the comming of the Bridegroome.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, beloved, if wee looke into the lives of men, I cannot tell, whether I shall say, they looke for his comming or no; <hi>this blessed hope.</hi> Wilt thou prophane the sanctified day of rest? wilt thou blaspheme the great and glorious name of God? wilt thou want only abuse the creatures of God, in drunkennesse? wilt thou lie, and steale, and whore, and yet tell mee thou lookest for that <hi>blessed hope?</hi> surely thou dost not. If quoth the Apostle, we doe looke for these things (in the place named before.) 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 14. Then</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>let us doe our diligence, that wee may bee found of him in peace.</hi> If thou doe not thy diligence, that when he comes, thou mayest bee found in peace, never tell me thou lookest for him.</p>
                  <p>There was never time yet for us to lie, and wallow in sinne, to thinke nothing that wee doe dishonest: there was never time for these things since time was. Surely there is no time for it now. All the dayes since Christ, are called the last dayes; all of them are the last dayes, since that day of the first <hi>Epiphanie:</hi> but there is a day that will be the last of all those last dayes. And me-thinkes it will not be long before that last day of all come: me-thinkes I see the day broke already, it is breake of day alreadie. Therefore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if you doe indeed looke for the comming of Christ, for this <hi>blessed hope,</hi> at his appearing, <hi>bee diligent, that you may bee found of him without spot, in holinesse.</hi> I have done with the Text.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the occasion at this time. You have brought hither, a dead body of a very good neighbour of ours, and whom I acknowledge, I ever found a kind, and a loving friend. You have brought it here to be laid up in the Grave, in hope of a blessed and joyfull resurrection. I need not speake much of his life here: an ancient inhabitant; When it pleased God to call mee first to this place 26. yeares since, I found him then in the chiefe office of the Church; and divers times since he hath been in it: and I have sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome knowne any more painfull, and more industrious, and more honest in those places then he was. Wee have all knowne him a man humble in his conversation, just of his word, true in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:14764:247"/>
mercifull in his dealing, charitable to the poore, readie to every good worke. His life was such a life; as the Apostle would have ours to be, a life sober, and just, and pious in this present evill world. Hee lived, and lead a life pious, in regard of God; just in regard of men, sober in regard of himselfe; I can say no lesse of him, and I will say no more of him.</p>
                  <p>I know you desire to heare of his death, and it hath much affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted my soule, to heare what unjust aspertions have beene upon the manner of it. There was a sudden stroake indeed of Gods hand; and it was in my house, and seeing that it so pleased God, I am glad that it was in my presence and sight, that I might give the better testimonie of it. The suddennesse of the stroake made him liable to some misconstruction, and hath given many men occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to passe a very uncharitable, and unchristian verdict of him.</p>
                  <p>I beseech you let me give you a true naked relation how it was. I never knew any men of so peaceable a disposition, but there might be sometimes some difference betweene them: there was betweene <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> betweene <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas;</hi> and there was betweene another honest neighbour and him: both men of a peaceable disposition. They did not desire to goe to law; they desired the matter might bee put to Arbitrators; they chose foure honest Gentlemen to take up the matter betweene them: they made me as an unworthy Umpire, in case they did not agree. On Thursday last they met, and each of them pleaded their cause. And let me say thus, that if this Brother of ours had beene judged, to doe any wrong in that cause; if hee had uttered one word of falshood to helpe his cause, if he had used one word of impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wishing any curse to himselfe; then it had beene peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a just thing with God, to have taken him at his word. If he had sworne one oath, if he had uttered but one uncharitable word against his neighbour; if he had shewed but any malice or spleene against him: if hee had beene but transported with passion, as a man may easily be in his owne cause, we are but men. I say if hee had beene but transported with passion; then peradventure some men might have thought it had beene the stroke of divine justice upon him: but let me tell you, I have the witnesse of honest Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that were the arbitrators, and will justifie</p>
                  <p>First, that his cause was good, and that there was not one word spoken, but was confirmed by honest witnesses present.</p>
                  <p>Then, he used no kind of imprecation in the world; no, not as I remember, so much as a protestation; or any asseveration, there was not one oath sworne, either by him, or by others that were present.</p>
                  <p>There was not one uncharitable word spoken by him: there was not any malice, or ranckour, or hatred appeared, either on the
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:14764:248"/>
one side, or the other betweene them; he was no way transported with passion.</p>
                  <p>He did plead his cause, but with that meeknesse of spirit, with that quietnesse, with that sweet temper, and that Christian mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as more could not be required in any Saint of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brethren, let me only tell you thus much, while this was in agitation, I could not perceive that hee was moved at any thing; hee was not stirred, he was not earnest in his cause. Till it pleased God to touch him; and he had some sense and feeling of it: rising from his stoole, he sate rubbing of his cheeke, or his necke with his handkercheife. Hee fell upon the necke of a Gentleman that sate close to him, who perceiving that he was not well, asked him how he did? he was scarsly able to give us an answer, I perceived that hee was stricken with the dead palsie. Brethren considering these things that I have told you before; I beseech you judge not, that you be not judged; condemne not, that you be not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. You owe a dutie to the truth, every one of you; and by that dutie that you owe to the truth, I was about to say, I charge you as before God; but I beseech you as before God, stoppe the mouthes of all them that shall either bee forgers, or spreaders of such notorious lies: though it pleased God it were by a sudden stroake of his hand; and how often hath hee done it, when men have beene worse busied? hee was but seeking to worke peace.</p>
                  <p>Though it pleased God suddenly to take his speech from him, yet I beseech you know this withall, hee was pleased not to take his life presently away; nor his understanding from him: from Thursday about foure of the clocke that hee was first stricken, hee lived till Saturday night, or Sunday morning, I know not whether: but in this time on Friday night I was with him, and I perceived by the lifting up of his hand that hee knew mee; I put him in minde of some gracious promises that God hath made to us in Christ. I asked him whether hee beleeved those promises of God, and whether hee found any comfort in those promises, and then hee lift up his hand. I asked him, and desired him, if hee found any assurance of Gods favour in Christ, to make the same signe; hee lift up his hand againe. I asked him if I should pray with him; hee desired it, and at the period of every Petition, his hand went up to God. And one thing I observed more, that in one petition of mine, in that prayer for him, that it would please God to deliver him from the malice of Satan, that would be most busie when wee are weakest; hee held up his hand higher then before, and continued holding it longer.</p>
                  <p>And blessed be our good God, that wee can hold and keepe an intelligence with him, not only by speech, but with our very
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:14764:248"/>
hands: that lifting up of the hand, and those groanes of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, I make no doubt, but they prevailed at the hands of God. And so as he lived, I make no question but hee died, a holy servant of God: and I hope his soule is now in heaven, and wee are come to lay up his body in the earth, in the hope of a blessed, and joyfull Resurrection.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two maine things to which the corrupt nature of man is subject and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, rash judgement, and vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; Both spring out of one roote, and that is pride; where pride possesseth the heart, it will make a man rash in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others, and presume vainely, and confidently upon himselfe; At all these e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils the Apostle strikes here in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, both mother and daughter: both root and branch.</p>
                  <p>To take heed of pride, that is the mother sinne, hee exhorteth us to thankfulnesse: where in stead of waxing proud of our selves, he would have us humble ourselves; and he brings this argument to perswade us, because <hi>they that humble themselves; God will exalt.</hi> The only way to be exalted, is to be humble; hee compares the state of man, (in respect of his future condition) to a paire of Balances that are hung on a beame, the lower the one balance is downe, the higher the other is up; the lower wee humble our selves in this life, the higher God will exalt us in the next.</p>
                  <p>The two maine evils which are the branches of this root, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle reproves in the eleventh verse. First, rash judging of others, the fault of those that are apt to speake evill of others; <hi>speake not evill one of another,</hi> saith the Apostle. That that commonly wee call the sinne of detraction, <hi>Aquinas</hi> saith, wee are guiltie of two
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:14764:251"/>
wayes, either reporting of another, that evill wee should not, or in not reporting of him that good wee should; in the one wee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend when wee doe either accuse him of that ill that hee is not guiltie of at all, or aggravate against him that ill that hee is guiltie of, making it appeare greater then it is; in the other we are guiltie, when we doe cut off all the good parts in a man, as if they were nothing at all, at least when wee extenuate that worth and goodnesse that is in him, making it appeare lesse then it is.</p>
                  <p>From this the Apostle disswades us by three arguments; First, because they that doe this, they doe wrong the Law; <hi>hee that speakes evill of another, speakes evill of the Law;</hi> for the Law would have us love. Secondly, they that doe this, they doe wrong God, they take Gods office out of his hands, when they take upon them to judge others; for he is the only Judge and none else; for he is the only <hi>Law giver,</hi> that is able to save us, and to destroy us. Thirdly and lastly, they wrong their brethren, when they censure and judge their brethren beyond their commission, they take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them more then they have authoritie; as if hee should say, you exceed your Commission in this, you take that upon you, that you have no warrant for: Thus against the rash judging of others.</p>
                  <p>Then against vaine confidence in our selves, this the Apostle strikes at too, at a confidence out of which a man prefixeth unto himselfe, what he will doe this day and to morrow, what he will doe this yeare, and the next yeare; what hee will buy, and sell, and gaine. <hi>Goe to now</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>you that say</hi> thus among your selves, <hi>to morrow you will goe to such a Gitie, and tarry there a yeare, and buy and sell, and get gaine;</hi> This is a foolish confidence, and the Apostle indeavours to reprove, and suppresseit,</p>
                  <p>By way of Correction.</p>
                  <p>By way of Direction.</p>
                  <p>His Correction is drawne, first from the ignorance of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that make such accompts as these; you say you will doe thus and thus to morrow, you shew your ignorance; <hi>you know not what shall be to morrow.</hi> Secondly, by the uncertaintie of the thing they reckon upon, then which, nothing is more uncertaine, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so uncertaine as that is, therefore it is not to be reckoned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Consider</hi> (saith the Apostle,) <hi>what is your life;</hi> you talke of doing this and that to morrow; <hi>What is your life? it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little while, and then vanisheth away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His directing Argument is in the next verse, where he teacheth us how we should speake of things future, and things present.</p>
                  <p>Of things future, not to speake too peremptorily of them, but with condition, <hi>if wee live, and if God will.</hi> And then for things present, not to rejoyce boastingly in them, for <hi>there is nothing
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:14764:251"/>
here to bee boasted of, or rejoyced in.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The thing that I have selected for this present time and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to discourse upon, is only that argument of the Apostle, wherein the shortnesse and uncertaintie of our life is represented, the Apostle sets it forth to us, by way of question, and answer; First, he puts the question, <hi>What is your life?</hi> as if he should say, it is a thing not worthy the reckoning of; Build upon nothing to bee done to morrow, upon so vaine a foundation, as that is: and to shew the uncertainty of our life, he comparatively describes it, and sets it forth, he saith, <hi>it is like a vapour that appeareth for a little while, and vanisheth away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>According to the methode, that the Apostle hath laid downe, so shall my discourse goe on; and first I will say something of the question he layeth downe: And then I will say something of the words of the Text.</p>
                  <p>First, to let us see what a poore uncertaine thing wee trust to, <note place="margin">Observat. 1.</note> when we build upon life, the Apostle throwes out this question, Your life, saith he, <hi>what is your life?</hi> Where first the Apostles phrase he speakes in, is worthy to be observed, <hi>your life,</hi> not ours, <hi>yours</hi> that make such accompts, and reckonings as these, promise to your selves what you will doe in following your worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, and increase your worldly gaine; <hi>What is your life?</hi> The life of worldlings the Apostle would secretly taxe, as some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positers collect, noting a difference and disparitie betweene Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in their wayes, and worldlings in theirs; worldlings are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together for this life, and the things of this life; they never dreame of any other to come; <hi>Post mortem nihil,</hi> &amp;c. as the Epicure in the Poet. Death that is an anihilation, and after death there comes nothing; Therefore all their projects and practices draw downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, they project for a worldly life, their buyings and sellings, and markettings, and profits; these are the things they minde and seeke after, all the thought of their hearts are bent upon these cares, all the dayes of their lives are spent upon these things: but there is another manner of life, that Christians looke for, <hi>there is a life hid with Christ in God;</hi> they know there is another life <note place="margin">Col. 3. 3.</note> to come after this, therefore their hearts are set upon other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of objects. They are not such as have their affections set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world, they make not accompt of themselves, as men of this world. <hi>Plato,</hi> being asked the question what countrey-man he was, he said, hee was a citizen of the world; a Christian is not so, he is no citizen of the world, but a citizen of heaven; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is said, <hi>Wee have our conversation in heaven,</hi> Phil. 3. 10. The Greeke word properly signifieth, Citizens or Burgeses; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> in his Epitaph upon <hi>Neapotian,</hi> renders it so; and <hi>Beza</hi> pertinent to the sense, though not proper to the Text, Wee
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:14764:252"/>
carry and behave our selves like Citizens, or Bourgeses, or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Heaven; they have all their affections, all their thoughts and desires bent that way, if they can obtaine that, they have as much as they desire, to crowne their wishes withall, they care for no other buying, but of the truth; they feare not selling but of their soules they wish no gaine but heaven.</p>
                  <p>And indeed this life, doth only deserve to be called a life, this life which the Saints, which Christians live; The life that they live to God; and this life, is that that must prepare them for a better life, the life in heaven. Of any other life but this, wee may aske the question in the words of the Apostle, <hi>What is it? what is it?</hi> It deserves not so much as the name, as he saith, though in name it be a life, indeed it is a death; but pretermit the disparitie, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene lives, some are comparatively, and other sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply considered. The life simply considered, is the subject of the Apostles question, <hi>What is your life?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Questions alway in the Scripture are empheticall, whether they tend to magnifie and advance, or to the vilifying and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of what they aime at; this here is most emphaticall, to shew us how poore and base a thing life is, like that question in <hi>Iob,</hi> to shew how poore and base a thing man is, <hi>Iob</hi> 7. 17. <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou art mindful of him, or settest thy hart upon him?</hi> So <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 8. 4. <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou art mindfull of him, or the son of man, that thou desirest him?</hi> Hee shewes how poore and base a thing man is: and he him selfe gives the answer to it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 114. 6. <hi>Man is like to vanitie;</hi> Nay, more plainly in <hi>Psal.</hi> 39. 6. <hi>Surely man is vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;</hi> nay, <hi>surely,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>man in his best estate is altogether vanitie.</hi> What could have beene more emphatically spoken? there is not a word there, but it hath its force; <hi>Man is vanitie; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is vanity; Every man in his best estate is vanitie; Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man in his best estate, is altogether vanitie;</hi> and then there is a word of asseveration by which hee seales, and buckles up all; <hi>surely, every man in his best estate, is altogether vanity.</hi> If the Apostle had but barely and nakedly said what hee had to say concerning the uncertaintie, and shortnesse of mans life, it had beene sufficient, if hee had said thus; <hi>Your life is a vapour that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares for a little while,</hi> &amp;c. but hee fetcheth it in with a <hi>Quere,</hi> hee puts it to a question, as if hee would demurre, and have us to pawse and consider of it, hee brings it in with a <hi>what is your life?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the Apostles leave, we may be bold to quit another questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, what the Apostle meanes to expresse it thus? Surely it is to inculcate that into us more throughly, and to make us pawse upon that more seriously: such questions as these make a great stop in a mans way, as <hi>Amaza's</hi> body in the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 12. it stopped the passage of the people that they could not get for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:14764:252"/>
so the interposing of such questions as these make a stop in our wayes and proceedings; they make us take new thoughts and thinke againe, they make us enter into new cogitations, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee better for us in that wee are doing to persist, or to breake off.</p>
                  <p>Let the consideration of it teach us wisedome, especially in <note place="margin">Vse.</note> perusing, and foreknowing of our worldly businesse, when wee are about it, let us ponder and pause, and suppose, and put the question, whether doe I well to doe thus? or what is it that I thus eagerly pursue? what is it that I seeke after?</p>
                  <p>Is it honour that I am ambitious of? why what is our honour but a breath? a height that many are raised to, out of favour ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then desert? like <hi>Phaetons</hi> Chariot, or <hi>Icarus</hi> Plumes, a Pinacle of honour, upon which he that stands must expect advancement, or ruine, to some it is a cloud of smoake, that the higher it mounts, the sooner it dies.</p>
                  <p>It is riches that we set our hearts upon? let us aske the question what is riches, but <hi>thicke clay?</hi> as <hi>Habakuk</hi> tearmes it, red and white earth as <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, or the baggage of the earth, as another expresseth it, as baggage is to the Army, so is riches to men, it cannot well be left behind, but alwayes hinders the march, and sometime loseth the battell; in the the getting of them there is a great deale of labour, in the keeping of them a great deale of care, and in the foregoing of them, a great deale of sorrow; a man may have them and not be happy, a man may want them, and yet be contented.</p>
                  <p>Is it pleasure, we are in love with, and dote upon? let us aske the question, what is pleasure? as a rose fenced with thornes, as a honey combe filled with stings; there is sweetnesse you will say, but it is very dangerous; forward it casts smiles; but back ward it throwes darts; that joy is <hi>like the cracking of thornes;</hi> when it goes out, it is as the snuffe of a candle, there is a great deale of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, sometimes in the greatest joy we have.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, is it life we build upon? aske <hi>what is your life?</hi> the Text answers that, <hi>It is a vapour that appeares for a little while, and then vanisheth away.</hi> If we could thus ponder, and pause, with serious meditations upon those worldly businesses, that wee so eagerly pursue; and put these questions to our selves in the pursuing of them; Beloved, they would peradventure helpe us so farre to see into the vanitie and vexation of them, as that the edge and heate of our desires would be abated and pulled downe.</p>
                  <p>I have done with the Question the Apostle propounds; <hi>What is your life?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I come to the words of the answer; <hi>It is even a vapour that appeareth,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein the shortnesse and uncertaintie of our
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:14764:253"/>
life is set forth; In the description of it observe two things;</p>
                  <p>First, what.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wherein.</p>
                  <p>First, what it is compared to: <hi>A vapour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, wherein it is compared to <hi>a vapour:</hi> In two things.</p>
                  <p>The shortnesse of abiding.</p>
                  <p>The suddennesse of departing.</p>
                  <p>First, the shortnesse of abiding, <hi>a vapour, that appeareth for a while.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where first observe, that the Apostle saith it <hi>appeares</hi> only; hee saith not it is, but it appeareth so; it rather <hi>appeares,</hi> then is any matter of substance.</p>
                  <p>And then this appearing is but short, <hi>for a little while,</hi> it tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries not.</p>
                  <p>And then the suddennesse of the departure, as the abiding is but short, so the departure of it is sudden, <hi>it is gone</hi> ere wee are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware; and when it is gone, we know not what is become of it; there is not so much as any print or memorie of it left.</p>
                  <p>To what our life is compared, that is the first point I am to speake of, it is compared to <hi>a vapour.</hi> If the Apostle had given no <note place="margin">Observat. 2</note> answer at all to the question he puts, wee might have imagined his meaning; and from other places of Scripture have abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly supplyed it. How many times and places of Scripture sets forth the shortnesse, and uncertaintie of our life, by sundry simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes and comparisons? sometimes it is compared to <hi>a dreame;</hi> sometimes to a <hi>spanne;</hi> sometimes to a <hi>shadow;</hi> sometimes to <hi>a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers shuttle;</hi> sometimes to <hi>a swift post;</hi> sometimes to <hi>a short race;</hi> sometimes to <hi>a watch in the night;</hi> sometimes to <hi>a flower in the field;</hi> sometime to <hi>a tale that is told.</hi> All these are significant expressions, to shew the shortnesse and uncertaintie of life; so that from other places of Scripture wee might answer the Apostles question, though he had said nothing; but his owne answer expresseth it fitly, and fully, by a pregnant, and pertinent resembling it to <hi>a vapour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Philosophers observe differences betweene vapours and exhalations, though both are drawne from the earth; yet the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an exhalation is moist and hot; the matter of vapours moist and cold: Exhalations rise from the superficies of the earth; Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours lie in the earth: exhalations continue longer, vapours shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but I need not stand upon Philosophicall distinctions, <hi>your life is a vapour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Observe how the resemblance holds betweene the one and the other. First, a vapour is nothing but a breath, therefore it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led so, of a word that signifieth, blowing or a breath, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but smoake, therefore <hi>Act.</hi> 2. it is called <hi>a vapour of smoake;</hi>
                     <pb n="487" facs="tcp:14764:253"/>
and such is our life, <hi>a vapour,</hi> because breath is nothing but <hi>the breath of life;</hi> So <hi>Moses</hi> called it in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. and when a man dies, it is said <hi>his breath departs from him;</hi> Therefore the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> he brings it as an argument, to shew what a vaine thing it is for a man to trust upon one, that hath no more hold on his life then so; <hi>Cease from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; what account is to bee made of him, yea, it is even as smoake, his dayes passe, and vanish away as smoake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>vapours</hi> are ingendered in the earth, and they lodge in the caverns, and hollow places of the earth; that is their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion house, where they have their beeing, such a <hi>vapour</hi> is our life; for this body of ours wherein our life is, it is a body of earth; <hi>Man hath his foundation in the dust, Iob</hi> 14. and there God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a receptacle and dwelling place, for our life to bee received into, and contained; it is said, when God gave it <hi>Adam</hi> first, <hi>hee blew it into his nostrils,</hi> there he made a lodging for it; therefore man is said to have <hi>his breath in his nostrils,</hi> in regard of which there is no trust to be given to him, nor no account to bee made of him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Vapours</hi> are drawne out of the earth by the Sunne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ayre, some to higher regions then others are; yet when they are all at their highest, they have no fixing nor setling, but are carried, and agitated, and tossed by the winds, till at last they be dissolved into showres, and dewes, and fall backe to the earth; so it is with our life, we come all at the first as vapours out of the earth, and there we have sunnes that draw us up, the favour of Princes peradventure, or great persons, some to higher regions then others; some are drawne to high places of honour, but when they are there, they have no setling nor fixing, as vapours in the ayre; they are hurried and tossed, and carried to and fro, from one wind to another, and after a long and restlesse motion, at last they fall downe to the earth againe, out of which they were taken.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, where the earth exhales many <hi>vapours,</hi> the earth is not so pure and wholsome as other places; for by experience wee find the healthfullest places are in the hillie high Countreys, but moarish low grounds have least health, and shortest lives, because of <hi>vapours;</hi> our life is a <hi>vapour</hi> in this respect; Many ill ayres con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually exhaled in our corrupt natures, the world is full of inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate concupsicence, and the Divell poysons every place where hee comes; so that while wee live here, wee live in a Moarish ground, and full of ill <hi>vapours</hi> and ayre, and therefore the higher we climbe the safer; as God saith to <hi>Lot</hi> in another case, when he bid him get him to the Mountaines, and there hee should be safe; so if we can get up to the Mountaine, <hi>the mount Sion,</hi> the place and habitation for God, and his blessed Angels for ever, there we shall
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:14764:254"/>
dwell in safetie, for there are no fogges and mists of temptations; there are no ill ayres; there is nothing that savours of sinne or miserie, either to breed us anoyance, or threaten vexation; So you see the first thing what it is our life is resembled unto, and how fitly the resemblance holds.</p>
                  <p>The second is, wherein it is compared to a <hi>Vapour.</hi> In two things;</p>
                  <p>The shortnesse of abiding.</p>
                  <p>The suddennesse of departing.</p>
                  <p>The shortnesse of abiding, <hi>it appeares for a little while.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where first observe, the Apostle useth the word of appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, it is a thing rather in appearance then in deed; of shew rather <note place="margin">Observat.</note> then substance; such is a <hi>vapour,</hi> when it first ariseth, and breakes out of the earth, it makes a great swelling to the eye, as though it would fill the ayre, and darken the Sunne, yet it hath no soliditie nor substance with it, but it is a meere empty tumour; it seemes and appeares to be something, but really it is nothing; And such is our life, it is rather a life in appearance, then in deed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>Austin</hi> knew not whether to call it a living death, or a dying life; for truly it is another manner of thing that deserves to be called life; only that deserves to bee called so, by which the soule lives to God, and by which the soule lives hereafter with God; that is the life of the soule, this is the life of the body; that is the life of Faith, <hi>the life that I live is by faith in the Sonne of God;</hi> Hee calls not that life by which the body is united to the soule, but that he calls life, whereby the soule is united to God; the soule may be dead, though the body be alive, if it be a stranger to the life of God, <hi>Dead in trespasses and sinnes,</hi> it may bee <hi>dead while it lives,</hi> Eph. 5. 14. <hi>Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</hi> Hee that lives in sinne, is dead in sinne, and the soule lives when the body is dead; therefore that cannot be the true life by which the body breathes, but that by which the soule subsists; if the soule when it is separate from the body, may have happinesse and live with God, that deserves tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the name of life; but if it be a stranger to it, though it live, that life is a dead life, nay the worst death; the Scripture calls it the <hi>second death,</hi> where though we never die, yet we are ever dying: the life that we live here, it is rather a thing in appearance then a being.</p>
                  <p>So all these things that belong to this life, all the joyes, and all the sorrowes of it, they are rather appearing joyes, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring sorrowes, then true joyes and true sorrowes.</p>
                  <p>Consider first the joyes of our life, they are not sound and true, but false and vaine joyes; if any wicked or ill thing bee the object of joy, as it is of too too many, they rejoyce in doing
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:14764:254"/>
wickedly, that is a false joy, they rejoyee in that they should sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and mourne for, and not only wicked and unlawfull, but worldly outward things, such as wee may rejoyce in, honours, pleasures, riches, and friends; yet these being well examined, there is no solide true joy, but a vaine joy in them, for they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford no rejoycing to the soule; it is only matters of spirituall joy, the <hi>joy in the holy Ghost,</hi> that the soule rejoyceth in, and with that joy the soule is ravished, though it be bereft of other; as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the soule may be overcome with spirituall sorrow, though there be abundance of outward joy presented to it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 14. our joyes are but appearing joyes.</p>
                  <p>Consider our sorrowes, and they are but appearing too, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be losse of comfort that we sorrow for, or sense of paine, being rightly examined, we shall find that they be rather shewes then true griefes, for there is nothing can bring true griefe upon the soule, but only the paine of sinne; nor no losse can bring any true sorrow upon the soule, but the losse of Gods favour: sorrow bestowed upon other things, it is but counterfeit sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, in comparison of this, therefore in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. the Apostle saith, that the chastisements that wee suffer here, <hi>they seeme grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and not joyous;</hi> they seeme grievous, as if all that we suffered here, were rather <hi>seeming</hi> then reall; and undoubtedly the Apostle said right, for whatsoever chastisement a man hath here, hee may possible have more matter of joy then of sorrow; to the same purpose the Apostle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 6. where hee describes the afflicted estate of the Saints (as God knowes they are subject to many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions) he doth it with an <hi>as it were,</hi> because he would vilifie the terrour of it. and not grant their condition so miserable as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, <hi>as it were dying; as it were wanting, as it were sorrowing;</hi> it is but as it were, such as they were not: so in <hi>Esay</hi> 29. 8. the Prophet there tell us how it is with a hungry man, and with a thirstie man, <hi>when he dreames, he dreames he eates, and he dreames he drinkes;</hi> But it is only the fancie of a dreame, he findes it quite otherwise, he findes his stomack as emptie as his hand, so it is with our life here, it is no better then a waking dreame; where we seeme to do what is done, and wee seeme to be what we are: Saith the Poet, what is one, and what is another? Man is like a shadow of a dreame; he that seemes something now, anon he falls and comes to nothing; and he that seemes nothing now, anon he riseth and comes to something.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see that all that ever we have here, it is but only see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, it is not reall, whether they be our joyes, or our sorrowes, they are but seeming joyes, and seeming sorrowes; yet againe this appearing, and seeming life of ours <hi>it indures</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>but a little while.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed <hi>vapours</hi> last not long, for the first matter they are made
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:14764:255"/>
of, affords not them any continuance; and besides that, they are easily dispelled and dispersed by the Sunne; such a <hi>vapour</hi> is our life. Out of the same Argument you may see that our life can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue but for a while, it cannot last long.</p>
                  <p>First, it is but a breath, as a <hi>vapour</hi> is. Againe, as <hi>vapours</hi> are apt to be dispersed, and dispelled easily by the hot Sunne, and the cold wind, so hot and cold diseases, and infinite sort of other casualties are easily apt to dissipate it; it is true, some <hi>vapours</hi> hang longer in the ayre then others, so this <hi>vapour</hi> of life it may keepe longer residence in some bodies then in others, but when it is longest, it is but a little while; <hi>David</hi> determines the date of it within the tearme of 80, yeares: the strength and vigour of it in the opinion of the Philosopher is of lesse continuance, the mind decayes at 45. yeares, and the body decayes at 35. If we compare the life of man with other creatures, then we will say it is but <hi>a while:</hi> the Raven, the Elephant, the Stagge, they out-live man double and treble.</p>
                  <p>If you compare it with the life of the world, then you will confesse it is but a <hi>little while,</hi> for the world hath continued and lasted some thousands of yeares, and there is not one man of ten thousand that holds to a hundred.</p>
                  <p>If we compare the continuance of this present age, to ages that are past, you will confesse it is <hi>but a-while;</hi> in formerages men lived some two hundred, some foure hundred, some five hundred, some nine hundred yeares; now, more die before ten, then after sixtie, so that if once our life were said to bee but the <hi>breadth of a hand,</hi> now I may say our life is but a fingers breadth.</p>
                  <p>If we compare it with eternitie, I am sure you will say it <hi>lasts but a while;</hi> for eternitie cannot be measured with any revolution of dayes, or moneths, or nights, or yeares; therefore in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of that: the life of man is but a <hi>vapour,</hi> and <hi>a vapour that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures for a little while.</hi> I need not insist to prove this point, the truth of it is confirmed every day, I will only give you the use of it.</p>
                  <p>First, is it so, that the life that we lead, is rather a seeming, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> then a reall life; then learne not to bee deluded with shewes, and appearances, not too much to be taken with the joyes of this life, they are but appearances, and the sorrowes of this life, they are but shewes; wee condemne fooles that are taken with shewes, and not with substances; as the Poet saith of <hi>Ixion,</hi> when he thought hee embraced a goddesse, hee embraced a cloud; wee embrace a cloud, when we thinke we embrace any good thing of this life; the world deludes us, as <hi>Michal</hi> did <hi>Saul,</hi> when hee thought he had found <hi>David,</hi> hee found nothing but an Image of <hi>David,</hi> and a pillow of goates haire; so what good things the
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:14764:255"/>
world promiseth, they are not good things, but the image of good things; honour is but the image of honour, they are only truly honourable that God honoureth, and such honour the world cannot bestow; she promiseth riches, but they are but the image of riches; they are only truly rich, that are rich in God, and the world cannot bestow that; she promiseth pleasure, it is but the image of pleasure; pleasure is only in the presence of God, at his right hand for evermore, and such pleasure the world cannot give; shee promiseth life, but it is but the image of life; that is only the true life whereby the soule lives unto God, and hereafter with God, and such a life as this the world is not able to give. Therefore let us not dote upon the world and worldly things, but learne as the Apostle exhorts, <hi>Col. 3. 2. To set our affections on things above;</hi> Those are the only reall good things, these are but imaginarie.</p>
                  <p>In the second place, this appearing life of ours, <hi>it lasts but a little</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> 
                     <hi>while;</hi> this may afford to us comfort, and instruction; first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to those, whose life here is full of troubles and sorrowes: the shorter time they have to indure, the more patient they may be in induring of it; nay, there is no greater blessing for those that live here wretchedly and miserably, then the abreviating and shortening their dayes; <hi>Why is light given to them that are in misery,</hi> (saith <hi>Iob) and the life of them is bitter to their soule, they long for death, and desire it, and digge for it, more then for treasure; and rejoyce and are axceeding glad when they find the grave.</hi> As the miserie of our life may be the more easie, considering the shortnesse of it, so the shortnesse of our life may be the lesse grievous, considering the miserie of it; for if God should lengthen out many mens lives, what would it bee but a lengthening of their miserie. But our life it is but a little while, therefore let us indure it with comfort.</p>
                  <p>And as it serves for comfort, so for instruction; for if the life we live in here be <hi>but for a little while;</hi> then learne to bestow this little time of life that we spend here, as profitably, and as faithfully as we can, both for the receiving and doing of good. Thou that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest now under a good Magistrate, under a good Minister, under a good Father, under a good Master, gaine all the good thou canst now, for peradventure they shall live; nay, certainly they shall live <hi>but a little while;</hi> and when their life is once quenched, thou knowest not what light thou maist have to walke by. And for our selves, since our life is <hi>but a while,</hi> let us be carefull to doe all the good we can, be stirring betimes, <hi>while wee have opportunitie, let us doe good to all.</hi> It is the madnesse of the Epicures, because they shall live but a while, they will live onely to themselves; <hi>Let us eate and drinke, because wee shall die tomorrow;</hi> and that is the reason,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:14764:256"/>
they die as beasts, because they care not to live as men. When they sing out their first <hi>canto,</hi> we will fill our selves with pleasure, the burden of the song must bee, that <hi>wee have wearied our selves with sinne.</hi> And it is the folly of the Mammonists, considering that they have not long to live, to put off the doing of all good till they die, whereas the rule of Christ is, <hi>to worke while wee have day, for shortly the night will come, when no man can worke;</hi> They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary put off all their worke till night; all the day their charitie sleepes, and doth nothing; as one said wittily, that that men give then, they give of other bodies then their owne, for they give that that they can keepe no longer, and though it be said to bee given by their Will and Deed, it is rather their Deed then their Will, for if they could have their will, it should never bee their Deed, they would rather be possessers of it themselves, then that others should be their Executors, but be exhorted to doe workes of charitie, and other good workes, while you have time, while you may make your owne eyes your overseers, and your owne hands your executors, while you have opportunitie doe good to your selves, and others, and the rather, because you know not how long opportunitie will be afforded, or tooke from you; <hi>For what is your life, it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little while.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus of the first circumstance, wherein the resemblance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists the shortnesse of abiding.</p>
                  <p>The next is the suddennesse of departing, <hi>It appeares for a while,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Observat.</note> 
                     <hi>and then vanisheth away;</hi> And here my discourse must be like a <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,</hi> short, it suddenly vanisheth away, that is the nature of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, | for as there is no matter to give it a fixed foundation; so when it appeareth for a little, it soone dissolveth and vanisheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayto nothing; and such a vapour is the life of man, it is gone sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, it is gone before wee be aware, and when it is gone, there is no memorie of it remaines, no print of it; how suddenly and quickly, in a moment, in the twinckling of an eye have many been deprived, both of breath and life, as one would put out a candle, or tread out a snuffe. It is true, sicknesse is one common Bailiffe that arests men at the suite of Death, but many a one hath beene made the prisoner of Death, that was never arested at the suite of Death; yee know <hi>Abell</hi> was murthered in the field; <hi>Ely</hi> broke his necke from the chaire; <hi>Absalon</hi> was snatched up in an Oke; the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient Prophet was slaine by a Lyon; the disobedient Prince was trodden to death in a crowde; <hi>Abimelech</hi> was slaine by a peece of a milstone; Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> was choaked with swallowing a flie; <hi>Pelus</hi> slaine with the fall of a tile. Such is our life, as a <hi>vapour,</hi> as the sand of an houre-glasse, ever spending, and ever running out; as <hi>Gregorie</hi> hath it in his Moralls, Looke how many dayes a man addes to his life, so many steps hee takes to his death; So <hi>Ieremie</hi>
                     <pb n="493" facs="tcp:14764:256"/>
to <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> wee are ever dying, for we every day change; when I am writing this, all the points of my penne spends a point of my life; nay, while we are hearing this Sermon, we are passing on.</p>
                  <p>I will make a little Vse of it; and then I have done.</p>
                  <p>First, make the Vse the Apostle doth to them that build upon fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitie, <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> and thinke they may do what they list; you that thinke you wil do to day, and to morrow, what you list. Oh, saith the Apostle, what reason have you to build on to day, and to morrow, when yee <hi>know not what a day will bring forth?</hi> We may not promise our selves life for to morrow, much lesse may we do as the foole in the Gospel, promise years, when we cannot assure our selves of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, if wee might assure our selves of a moment of life, in which it might be said, it were impossible to die, we might possibly be immortall, and not die at all, but as <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, corruptible, is not so capable of incorruption, but since it hath beene subject to fall, till it doth fall, it is ever declining; there is no building nor trusting to uncertaine futuritie, we must not rest, and trust on those things which are to come, but only upon God, and speake condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally of them, not absolutely; referre the successe and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of all things to come, to the will and good pleasure of God, remembring what our life is, so make lesse accompt of our life, and of our selves and all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, seeing our life is so vanishing, let us ever prepare for death, for sudden death, because life is vanishing; <hi>Thou knowest not in what houre thy master will come.</hi> Therefore every houre we should so bestow our selves, that our Master may find us at worke.</p>
                  <p>For this, two things are requisite;</p>
                  <p>First, ever thinke of death, death cannot be sudden to that man, that ever thinkes of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, be carefull to lead a godly life; the goodnesse of the life consists not in the long continuance of it, but in the well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying of it, it may be any mans case to live well, it can be no mans to live long; our comfort is, though our life bee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie, yet notwithstanding this very moment of time, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to gaine to us here-after eternitie, and how much better is a short time well spent, for the purchasing of eternall happinesse, then a short time ill spent, for the purchasing of eternall miserie? your life is momentarie, yet eternity depends on it, if it be spent ill, eternall miserie, if well we are eternally happy: howsoever here we vanish as a <hi>vapour;</hi> yet one day wee shall become as fixed starres in the right hand of Christ, wee shall shine as starres for ever.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have shewed how the life of man is compared <hi>to a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour that appeares for a little while, and then vanisheth away.</hi> Beloved; I pray let not this Sermon passe as a <hi>vapour,</hi> let not all of it passe
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:14764:257"/>
away in the sound you heare, <hi>but fix it as a naile in a sure place,</hi> in your understanding, in your memorie, in your affections; and remember how short and sudden every mans end and life is, or may be; <hi>O that my people were wise, they would understand this, they would consider their latter end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee have a spectacle here before us, that was a reall comment upon this Text; She did understand the Doctrine of it, and was excellent in the practice of it; A Gentlewoman that deserved a better Orator to commemorate the vertues that were in her, and to give her praises due; it had beene a fitter worke for your reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and worthy Minister, whose absence at this time I supply, he could have spoken more fully of her then I can, because he was acquainted longer with her then I was; I account it a part of my unhappinesse, that I knew her so little a while, and peradventure you will say it is a part of her unhappinesse, that this office is done by one that knew her so little a while; It is true indeed, I am not able to say much of her, for my knowledge of her was but a few weekes or moneths, by reason of our neighbourhood in the Countrey, but then I observed her to be one of the ornaments of her sexe, and every thing that came from her was gracefull and comely; the sweetnesse of nature and grace, in my opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in her; But I must deliver the most that I have to say, from the report that I have from others, yet from very good hands. <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>A good name, is as a good oyntment poured forth,</hi> like the precions Alablaster-boxe that <hi>Mary</hi> broke on the head of our Saviour, the smell of it perfumed all the house; I may say of her, as the Apostle saith of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> She was well reported of by all, and I am perswaded she was reported well of the truth it selfe, shee had a name answerable to her vertues; <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>A prudent wife,</hi> or a good wife, <hi>is the gift of God;</hi> shee was a <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> that was her name, <hi>The gift of God;</hi> and a gift God bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the comfort of him that had her.</p>
                  <p>Shee was constant both in the performance of publike duties and private, in hearing Gods word, not only on the Lords day, but (as occasion gave leave) on the weeke-dayes, and she was not only constant at good exercises abroad, but (which was the crowne of her commendations) she was so at home also, shee was constant in reading the Word; I am credibly informed, that shee read over the Bible seven times in the seven yeares that shee was married; Shee constantly made use of that shee heard, I my selfe saw no lesse then two quires of paper writ out with her owne hand, collected partly out of other bookes, but principally out of Sermons, not noted at Church, when shee heard them, but when she came home, being in this like <hi>Mary</hi> that layed up the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ in her heart; her daily spending of her time was
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:14764:257"/>
commendable, and exemplarie; in the morning up to prayer with her familie, and then unto private prayer by her selfe: from prayer to reading, and then to worke; and then to prayer, and to dinner, and then to worke; this was her continuall course of life without interruption. Shee was a <hi>Sarah</hi> for obedience, <hi>Rebecca</hi> for wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>Mary</hi> for pietie, <hi>Martha</hi> for houswiferie, a true <hi>Lidea,</hi> shee heard, and God opened her heart, that shee attended to those things she heard. A true <hi>Dorcas,</hi> full of good workes; they that knew her, knew her (so farre as wisedome and discretion dictated to her) full of charitie, of good workes, and almes-deedes. But her <hi>life was a vapour that appeared for a little while, and then vanished away.</hi> Shee verefied my Text too truely, in that it pleased God suddenly to call her, even in the prime and strength of her yeares, she was but a young woman, and shee died in Child-bed.</p>
                  <p>You that are Child-bearing women, I wish you to set this pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne and example before your eyes, and learn by this spectacle to see how neere you walke to the brincke of your grave, when you come to be delivered of childe; I wonder therefore by the way, that any should find fault with that solemne thanks-giving, that is appointed by the Church to be rendred to God for women, for his preserving them from the great danger of Child-birth, there is but a step betweene you and death, you should then have a care to prepare for your death; I see a great deale of time spent to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare all brave and fine, God may quickly turne all your cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and hang them with blacke, and turne your jollitie into mourning; therefore you should rather prepare for your win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-sheete, and for your grave; for undoubtedly she did so: and I may in some sence apply that literally of the Apostle to her; In bearing of children shee is saved. It is true, the Apostle gives that as an argument of comfort to women, because before hee had preached obedience to them, a doctrine that they doe not well relish, yet he gives two reasons, because <hi>Adam</hi> was first made, and she first sinned, that is another reason; yet lest shee should bee too much discouraged with that of the Apostle, and because the paine of child-bearing was threatned to women for a part of their curse; the Apostle addes that as a comfort; <hi>In bearing of children they shall bee saved.</hi> Notwithstanding the paine and sorrow of child-bearing was inflicted as a punishment upon them, yet under that curse there is a way of salvation opened; if they be such wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, saith the Apostle, as, <hi>continue in faith and charitie, with holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and sobrietie.</hi> These vertues being eminent in this deare Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian sister of ours, no doubt but in bearing of children shee is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; that is, she found under that curse, a way to a blessing, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting blessing of salvation.</p>
                  <p>How shee disposed her selfe in the time of her sicknesse, those of
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:14764:258"/>
the family well know; truly I have not oft, scarse ever heard of a woman of her ranke and quality, (for shee was a woman well descended, and well bred,) and yet I never heard of a woman more beloved, and more bewayled: her Husband complaines of his losse, never man lost a better wife; all the servants, never any had a better Mistris; and all the neighbours, never any had a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter neighbour. Concerning her in the time of her sicknesse, they can give a better, and more particular testimonie then I; I only did one office and service to her, when in the absence of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Pastor, I was called, I visited her an houre or two before she went, when (God knowes) she was faint and weake, and able to breath but a few words, but they were sweet; I told her, I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and doubted not, but that as she had made a Christian profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in her life-time, so now shee would seale it up: she answered; <hi>I have indevoured to serve God, but with a great deale of infirmitie and weaknesse, I rest not upon that, I rest upon my evidence, and there is my comfort; I doubt not, but hee that hath given mee the evidence, will also give me the inheritance.</hi> I thinke these were the last words shee spake.</p>
                  <p>Thus shee is gone to her rest, her body to rest, as <hi>a prisoner of hope,</hi> till the Resurrection, her soule rests in the armes of God; I have no more to say to her, or of her, then that Christ said to the woman in the Gospell; <hi>Woman, goe in peace, thy faith hath saved thee.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE holy Apostle in this Chapter, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers a number of precepts, and generall rules for sanctification, and enforceth them with sundry reasons.

                  </p>
                  <p>These few words may be called, <hi>Saint Pauls Trumpet,</hi> to rouze the sluggish Christian. They were the occasion of the conversion of that famous instrument, S. <hi>Austin</hi>

<pb n="500" facs="tcp:14764:260"/>
earnestly, and ardently called upon God. And in his prayer (as himselfe records) he seemed that he did heare the voyce of a child speake to him, <hi>Tolle, lege: Take up the booke and reade.</hi> Hereupon running backe againe to his studie, his booke being open, the first place that he cast his eye upon was this verse; <hi>It is now time, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the season, that you awake out of sleepe. And</hi> (saith he) <hi>with the end of the sentence I found an infused life.</hi> Hee found in the reading of this sentence, as soone as he had read it, the life of grace infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into him, and his conversion was compleat. This place of Scripture hath beene famous in the Church, for the conversion of that famous instrument. I would to God (as wee doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire) that the Lord would bestow the same blessing among some of us; who not only heare these words read, but are now to be expounded in your eares.</p>
                  <p>For the understanding of which, wee are to enquire of divers things for the meaning of the words. <note place="margin">

                  <p>First, we are to enquire what is here meant by <hi>sleepe; It is time to awake out of sleepe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, what is meant by <hi>arising, or awaking out of sleepe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, who they be that must <hi>arise, or wake out of sleepe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and lastly, why the Apostle doth bestow this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation upon sleepy persons that cannot heare what he saith?</p>
                  <p>For the first of these, what is meant by <hi>sleepe?</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Naturall <hi>sleepe</hi> is that spoken of, <hi>Psal.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>I will lay my selfe downe to sleepe, and rise againe.</hi> This naturall <hi>sleepe</hi> is the rest, and <note place="margin">1. Naturall. Psal. 3. 5.</note> restitution of nature.</p>
                  <p>Morall <hi>sleepe,</hi> is naturall death; this is the death, and dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature, of which the Scripture speaketh, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>They</hi>

                  <p>Spirituall <hi>sleepe,</hi> it is the sleepe of sinne, and securitie: this is the death and privation of grace in the soule; as the other is the <note place="margin">3 Spirituall, compared to sleepe.</note> privation of life in the body: of this our Text speaketh; <hi>It is time to arise, or awake out of this sleepe;</hi> the <hi>sleepe</hi> of sinne, and securitie.</p>
                  <p>Now the state of sinne and securitie, is compared here to the state of <hi>sleepe,</hi> because there are many resemblances and likenesses betweene the state of a sinner, and a sleepie man: for what effect sleepe hath in the body, the same effect hath the sleepe of sinne in the soule. I will shew it you in a few instances, and so passe it.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>They that sleepe</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>sleepe in the night.</hi> The <note place="margin">1. For the time, the night.</note> same that the Apostle aymes at here; <hi>It is time to awake out of sleepe:</hi>
                     <pb n="501" facs="tcp:14764:260"/>
because <hi>the night is past.</hi> The night is a time to sleepe in. So, those that sleepe in sinne, it is because they are in the night of sinne, there is a darknesse, the Canopie is spread over them, the Sunne of grace, and the day of salvation shines not upon them: their eyes are closed up in darknesse, as it is with a sleepie man.</p>
                  <p>Againe, when a man goes to sleepe, he puts off his cloathes; <note place="margin">2. Exposed to danger.</note> he lies naked, exposed to all dangers. And when a man is in the sleepe of sinne and securitie, he wants his garments, to bee cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with Christs righteousnesse and holinesse: he lies naked, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and open to all Gods displeasure, and all the arrowes of Gods wrath. So in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. when the Israelites, the people of <note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note> God, had made a Calfe, <hi>Moses</hi> came and saw them <hi>naked;</hi> that is, destitute of Gods protection, and wanting that garment, that armour of proofe, that righteousnesse that before they had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
                  <p>Againe, a man naturally layes himselfe downe willingly to <note place="margin">3. Willingnesse.</note> sleepe, he is willing to take his rest. So it is in the sleepe of sinne, every naturall man is willing to lay himselfe downe to sleepe in sinne, to take his ease, and rest in sinne; for <hi>there is no man but hath free will to sinne, though no man hath free will to good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And againe, as sleep it surprizeth a man suddenly oft-times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">4. Suddennesse.</note> he is aware, or before he can remember himselfe where hee is, or what he is doing: so the sleepe of sinne, it oft surprizeth a man before he is aware. As wee see in the Disciples of Christ themselves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. bodily sleepe surprized them, even then <note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> when they intended to watch; and when Christ appointed them to watch: but the sleepe of their mindes and foules was much more: for that was not a time to sleepe, if they had knowne what they had beene about.</p>
                  <p>Againe further, as the sleepe of the body bindes up the senses, <note place="margin">5. Incensible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> and makes a man senslesse of that which is good or evill: he that sleepes, offer him a Kingdome, it moves him not: threaten him, draw a sword, offer to stabbe him, he stirres not, he is not sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; he is unmoveable: a man that is asleepe, where you left him, there you shall find him still. So it is in the sleepe of sinne, it bindes up all the spirituall senses, that a man that is in this sleepe, he wants a seeing eye, and a hearing eare, he knowes nothing, he sees nothing of God, (but that which will make him in-excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:) he tastes not, he feeles not how good God is to him. Offer him the kingdome of heaven, and grace in the meanes; it moves him not: threaten him, draw out the sword, the weapons of Gods wrath against him, he feares nothing. As he is insensible in these courses, so he is immovable, looke where he was at the first, there you shall find him still, there is no difference: but he is as a dead man, as long as he sleepes thus in sinne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="502" facs="tcp:14764:261"/>
To conclude this point: sixtly, the sleepe of the body deludes <note place="margin">6. Vaine fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</note> a man with many vaine dreames, and foolish conceits, false joyes, and false feares, and false hopes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are nothing true. So the sleepe of sinne in the soule, it hath the same effect, it feedes a man up with false joyes, and false hopes: it casts him downe with false feare, where no feare is. A man in the state of sinne, hee feares the face of man, the eye of man, the word of man, the hand of man: he feares not the eye of God, nor the word of God, nor the mighty power of God. So likewise for false joyes, a man that is a begger, he dreames that he hath gold enough, that he tumbles in it. So beggers in grace, those that have not a ragge of righteousnesse upon them, they dreame that they <hi>are rich, and increased in goods, and that they have need of nothing, when they know not that they are poore and beggerly, and naked,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea.</hi> So this spirituall sleepe, it fills a man with false conceits.</p>
                  <p>A man sometime when he goes to sleepe, hee thinkes not to sleepe long, but to take a nappe, and wake by and by, yet it may <note place="margin">7. The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.</note> be he sleepes beyond his compasse, sometime he wakes no more? So, it is with a man in sinne, he hopes to wake, he thinkes to sleepe but a little, but sometime he sleepes long, and sometime he never wakes. So we see how aptly the spirit compares the estate of a man in sinne to sleepe. This is the first thing in the meaning of the words.</p>
                  <p>Now the second thing is, what is meant by <hi>waking,</hi> or <hi>arising</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. What meant by waking.</note> out of sleepe. To <hi>wake,</hi> or to <hi>rise out of sleepe,</hi> is for a man to doe in the matter of Christianitie, as a man that awakes out of sleepe. And for a man that wakes out of sleepe, there are three things he doth, and so out of the sleepe of sinne.</p>
                  <p>First, there must be an opening of the eyes, and a beholding of <note place="margin">1. To open the eyes to see the light.</note> the light. And this is the first thing in awaking out of the sleepe of sinne and securitie: a man must labour to open his eyes, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the light of Gods word, and that shining grace that the Lord propounds to him in the Scriptures: he must open his eyes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the light; and that will discover such objects as will keepe him awake. Therefore men sleepe so much in the night, because they are in the darke, and not in the light; they see objects in the day time that keepes them awake. So for this sleepe of sinne, if we would keepe awake, let us open our eyes to behold the light of grace; and in the light of the Scriptures wee shall see objects that will helpe to keepe us waking: we shall see Gods displeasure, the wrath of God, we shall see those things, that <hi>eye cannot see, nor eare heare, nor hath entred into the heart of man.</hi> Wee shall see them in their beginning and degrees; though the full degree cannot enter into the heart to conceive, and this will helpe to keepe us waking.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="503" facs="tcp:14764:261"/>
Then in the next place when a man hath opened his eyes to see <note place="margin">2. To rouze the senses.</note> the light, then there must be a rouzing of the senses. This awakes a man, when his senses that were bound up by sleepe are loosed, that now hee is able to see, and to move, and to talke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What unbindes the spirituall senses of a man in this sleepe of sinne? only faith in the Sonne of God, that opens the eyes of them that were dead in sinne; it restores new senses, and life, that they are able to walke in the wayes of God, and to move in the actions of godlinesse and Christianitie. Therefore the second thing that a man must doe to awake himselfe out of sleepe, is to get faith in his soule, that he may sucke vertue from Christ, and to get his senses loosed that he may see, and taste, and feele the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God, which without Christ he cannot attaine.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and lastly, a man must get out of his bed, to awake <note place="margin">3. Get out of bed.</note> him out of sleepe, when his eyes are open, and his senses loosed, leape out of the bed; that is by repentance: this is <hi>to cease to doe evill.</hi> Therefore when the Apostle exhorts <hi>to rise out of sleepe,</hi> these are the three maine things the Apostle aymes at, wherein hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth it plentifully. First, to get the true knowledge of God, to see those objects that may allure, and draw our mindes. And then labour to get faith in the Sonne of God, whereby our senses may be unbound. And then to get out of the bed of sinne by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>to cease to doe evill, and learne to doe well:</hi> this is to awake out of the bed of sleepe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, who they are that must <hi>arise out of sleepe?</hi> Every man: <note place="margin">3. Who must awake.</note> for so the Apostle plainly expresseth it <hi>Ephes. 2. Awake thou that sleepest,</hi> whosoever thou art that sleepest, awake, and rise out of sleepe.</p>
                  <p>But who are they that sleepe. <note place="margin">Quest. Answ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two sorts of men: all sorts of men may bee reduced to two heads;
The <list>
                        <item>Naturall</item>
                        <item>regenerate</item>
                     </list> man.</p>
                  <p>And both sleepe.</p>
                  <p>The naturall man is in a fast, dead sleepe; you shall as soone get a <hi>ribbe out of his side;</hi> (as God did out of <hi>Adam, when hee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe)</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. The naturall man.</note> as wake him. You shall sooner <hi>drive a nayle into his temples,</hi> as <hi>Iael</hi> did to <hi>Sisera,</hi> then awake him. Hee is in a fast dead sleepe, <hi>in the sleepe of death:</hi> as a man in a Lethargie that never wakes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Therefore this man had need to arise, to bee called upon, and to be rouzed out of <hi>the sleepe of death: Awake thou that sleepest, stand up from the dead, that Christ may give thee light;</hi> Arise as a man ariseth out of the Grave, out of the bed of sleepe. This is the man that is in a dead sleepe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="504" facs="tcp:14764:262"/>
But not only these are in a dead sleepe, but the regenerate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <note place="margin">2. The regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</note> are in a sleepe, and they keepe not themselves so waking, and so watchfull, as they ought to doe: therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle applies it to himselfe, and to all the Saints; <hi>It is time for us to awake out of sleepe.</hi> Hee puts himselfe in the number: For hee that is most wakefull had need to bee more, and to rise out of sleepe still. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. It is the voyce of the Church; <hi>I sleepe but my heart waketh.</hi> Even the Church her selfe that was <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 2.</note> waked already in part, in a great part: yet she confessed that shee slept. Her sleepe was not so dead, and so fast as formerly, yet she slept, and slumbred; <hi>I sleepe, but my heart waketh.</hi> It was not a heartie, a dead sleepe as the other was. So in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. it is said of the <hi>wise virgins,</hi> as well as of the <hi>foolish, they all slumbred and slept.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> The <hi>foolish</hi> slept; that is, they were fast asleepe: the <hi>wise virgins</hi> they <hi>slumbred.</hi> And so the Disciples themselves, by the side of our Lord, even when a temptation was neere, and the tempter was upon them, they fell fast asleepe, and were not able to <hi>watch</hi> with Christ, no, <hi>not one houre,</hi> as Christ saith.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see (brethren) that those also that are Regenerate, those that have received the greatest measure of grace, and are in the highest forme in grace (for who was higher then Saint <hi>Paul)</hi> they themselves have need to be called out of sleepe; <hi>It is time for them to awake out of sleepe,</hi> though they be waking persons: even those that have received grace to beleeve, and obey, and bee watchfull in some measure, even these must be called out of sleep.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 2. It is the counsell that is given to the <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 2.</note> Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> that had received some grace, and was in some measure watchfull: saith the holy Ghost to that Church; <hi>Be awake, and strengthen the things that are ready to die.</hi> He tels them in the words before, <hi>Thou hast a name to live, but art dead;</hi> that is, thou art even almost dead, there is a little life of grace in thee, thou art almost dead: for so it is explained in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>awake, and strengthen the things that are readie to die</hi> Thus we see the difference betweene the calling of the wicked, and the godly in their sleepe. The one is called from sleepe, <hi>to stand up from the dead:</hi> the other <hi>to strengthen the things that are ready to die.</hi> And thus we see the persons who must wake.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, Why doth the Apostle call upon sleepers <hi>to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. Why the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle calls upon these that are asleepe.</note> 
                     <hi>awake out of sleepe?</hi> Wee see naturall men, are as dead men, in a dead sleepe, he doth but lose his labour, and spend his breath, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not heare and understand. And the godly likewise, it is with them as with a man in a sleepe, they are drowsie; and doe not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend what is spoken.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer briefly; Exhortations in Scripture are never in vaine, fall where they will. <note place="margin">Exhortations not invaine.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="505" facs="tcp:14764:262"/>
This voyce of exhortation, if it come upon regenerate men that <note place="margin">1. To the godly.</note> are awake in part, it is a meanes to awake them more: it is a means to keepe them awake, as it was a meanes to awake them at the first.</p>
                  <p>If it fall upon wicked men that are in a dead sleepe, it serves <note place="margin">2. To the wicked.</note> (if not to awake them, yet) to convince them, to make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable: for such a man might object, What is this to me? I am called on to awake, I am in a dead sleepe; can I heare if I be in a dead sleepe? But know this, thou that art in a dead sleepe, that art not able to heare: thou art not able to heare, because thou hast cast thy selfe into a dead sleep. For this is the difference: Suppose a man in the night season be in his first sleepe, tell him a message from God, what he would have him to doe; hee understands it not, he knowes it not: it is no sinne of his, because he is a-sleepe: because God hath ordained this sleepe to be due to nature. But it is not so in the sleepe of sinne, God doth not cast a man into the sleepe of sinne; but man himselfe, and the divell: therefore if thou have cast thy selfe into this sleepe, that thou know not what God would have done; it is thy sinne, and shall bee thy damnation: looke to it. The exhortations and precepts fall not in vaine, <hi>as the raine returnes not in vaine,</hi> either they awake a man more that was awake before; or they convince him that is not awake: because he is fallen asleepe by his owne sinne, and the malice of the divell. To come therefore to the Use, and Application.</p>
                  <p>The point thus opened, leads us to the consideration of that <note place="margin">The dead sleepe of the world.</note> wofull sleepe that oppresseth the world.</p>
                  <p>And then to consider the sleepe that oppresseth the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>First, to consider the sleepe of the wicked and unregenerate, <note place="margin">1. Idolaters.</note> those that are in the dead sleepe of sinne. Even as the Prophet observed in his time, so now who doth not see <hi>all the world at rest and at peace?</hi> like <hi>Lachish</hi> that secure people; a dead people, crying, <hi>peace, peace, to themselves,</hi> and fearing nothing till they be awaked; there is nothing but securitie. To shew this in some particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, what a number of persons be cast into the dead sleepe of sinne.</p>
                  <p>First of all Idolaters, where of there are a numerous generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every where; they are fast asleepe in the bed and bosome of that whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that hath inchanted, and bewitched them with <hi>the cuppe of her fornication.</hi> They have layd themselves downe to take a nappe upon her lappe, as <hi>Sampson</hi> did upon <hi>Dalilahs,</hi> till they lose their <hi>locks,</hi> and their life as he did: and all the meanes that GOD hath used a long time: all the light of grace, the light of knowledge; all the ministrie that hath beene so powerfull, and so plentifull, cannot pull them out of her lap:
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:14764:263"/>
but the Lord hath threatned, not only <hi>Iezabel</hi> that whore and strumpet, (by which he meanes, that whore of <hi>Rome)</hi> but all those that <hi>commit fornication with her, to cast them into a bed of sorrow;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 2.</note> he will cast them upon a bed of little ease; and he will <hi>slay her children:</hi> The conclusion of this fearfull sleepe shall be death. Even as <hi>Sisera</hi> when he slept, the <hi>nayle was driven into his temples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So likewise a generation of uncleane adulterers, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe <note place="margin">2. Adulterers.</note> upon the foule bed of voluptuousnesse, and uncleannesse: blow a Trumpet in their eares, ring a peale of Ordnance against them, that is able to make the stones quake, and the rocks to breake asunder; tell them that <hi>whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.</hi> Nay, let the world ring a peale of infamie, and shame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, follow them with infamie, and reproaches for their sin, yet all this awakes them not: they will scarse open their eyes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be in the <hi>twilight,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, a little to waite at their neighbours doore for his wife or his daughter; till the Lord also cast them upon the bed of shame, and sorrow, and scorne, and curse, from which they shall never rise. It is a lamentable thing, that a mans conscience hearing this, should not apply this to his heart, that he should dare to shut his eyes, and dare still to cast himselfe on this bed, not thinking what will be the issue of it.</p>
                  <p>And so likewise, a monstrous generation of Drunkards, mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in nature, for no unreasonable creature so much extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">3. Drunkards.</note> the gifts of nature as they. These cast themselves upon the bed of vomiting, and filth, that no covering is large enough to hide their shame. Let a man speake to them, and advise and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell them; there is no hearing of him in their cups, as <hi>Abigaile</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in her husband <hi>Nabal.</hi> Nay, let God speake to them, and pinch them in their bodies, in their strength, in their estates: let the Lord make them feele the smart; be their dangers never so neere, as <hi>Solomon</hi> describes them notably in <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. a drunken <note place="margin">Prov. 23.</note> man <hi>is as hee that sleepes on the top of a Mast, in the middest of the Sea</hi> in most extreame perill, yet, saith he, <hi>they have smitten mee, but I felt it not; they have beaten me, but I discerned it not;</hi> therefore <hi>when hee awakes, he will follow</hi> his cups still.</p>
                  <p>The like we may say of a number of Sabbath-breakers, that <note place="margin">4. Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakers.</note> cast themselues upon the bed of prophanenesse, and Atheisme: sometimes for forme, and fashion, they will come to the Temple perhaps, and listen a little to the word spoken: but presently you shall see and observe them, that they cast themselves fast asleepe, as <hi>Eutichus, when at midnight Paul was preaching, hee falls from the loft, and his life was gone from him:</hi> But there is this difference, that was at midnight, these will doe it at mid-day. So little have men gained of instruction, and of the knowledge, of the feare of God; of all that they have heard, that they can scarse keepe their eyes,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:14764:263"/>
and their eares open, a quarter of the exercise, to heare what God saith to them for their owne good.</p>
                  <p>What shall I speake of those unjust, injurious, usurious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, <note place="margin">5. Oppressours.</note> whose jawes are as knives to cut those that they deale with? those that use injustice in their weights, in their wares, in their lights; that use any manner of deceit for the defrauding of their brethren. And these cast themselves upon the bed of their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, and solace themselves in their present unjust gaines, in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unjust riches.</p>
                  <p>Let a man speake to these; and tell them their estate out of the Scriptures; alas they heare not; deale with them, as wee deale with men in a swoone; rubbe them, and chafe them, and if that will not serve the turne, pinch them, pricke them, and wring them, and make them smart, if it be possible to make them feele: alas, such a man dies in our hands, there is no life to be got in him. All that we can get from such a wretch for our love to him, and our testimonie of him, it is some brush or blow. This senslesse man layes about him, he knowes not upon whom.</p>
                  <p>In one word, when I consider the secure course of a multitude <note place="margin">6. Securitie.</note> of men amongst whom we live: it seemes as if they had found that Cave of sleepe which the Poets faine, and speake of, a place very fit for these persons. A Cave of sleepe, as they describe it, where never Sunne shines: a place farre remote from all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: a place where the houses have no doores for feare the hindges should wake them: a place where they suffer no cocks, nor clocks, nor nothing that may hinder them from sleepe. And the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men that I speake of, they seeme to descend from <hi>Severats;</hi> a kind of people that are loose, and lazie, and sleepie, and lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, that will not indure any Clocks, or any Artificers that use tooles and hammers to knocke, that they should not trouble them.</p>
                  <p>But why doe you speake these words? they seeme strange to us?</p>
                  <p>But yet truly, your selves shall say they bee true in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
                  <p>For first, doe we not see most men in generall, (except some few whom the Lord hath taken into his owne teaching,) that they cannot abide the place of the Sun-shine, the place where the Sunne of the light of grace shines, they remove themselves from it, they absent themselves upon any occasion, as if a man should set himselfe to run from the light of the Sunne.</p>
                  <p>So likewise doe we not see that men cannot abide the societie of godly men, of religious men fearing God, that deale truly with them in exhortations, and admonitions, and loving rebukes, &amp;c? They will none of this. So doe we not see how readie,
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:14764:264"/>
and willing naturall men are to chase away, (if it were possible) all the Lords Cocks, and all his servants, that they might not crie against their sinnes, that they might not awaken them, nor come neere them. They are set so fast asleepe, that they cannot abide any servant of God, And for the ministerie of the Law, which <hi>Ieremie</hi> calls, as <hi>a Hammer to breake the hard heart,</hi> and to knocke, and rappe the sleepie soule, it is an intollerable thing; they cannot indure this hammer; they cannot abide these dogges that barke against their sinnes: whereas <hi>dumbe dogges, that can neither barke,</hi> nor bite, those they can like well enough. Somewhat they would have, they are content with a formall fashion: but these men that speake against their sinnes, that discover their estate in sinne; these they cannot induue. Now tell me if these men live not in a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sleepe? and are found in the Cell, and Cave of darknesse, wherein they desire to sleepe for ever?</p>
                  <p>To come from these, in the second place let us consider, that <note place="margin">The sleepe of the Church.</note> not only these naturall men, and worldlings, are cast into a dead sleepe; but would not a man marvell, that even Christians should sometimes bee cast asleepe? Would not a man wonder that the Disciples of Christ that were so neere to the side of their Master, that were following their Masters exhortation in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Precept that he taught them, that were so neere temptation; that the yoake was even upon their necks; would not one thinke it a wonder, that they should <hi>not watch one houre,</hi> with Christ?</p>
                  <p>Therefore Brethren, let us take notice of our securitie much more, that are infinitly behind the Disciples in grace: let us rate our selves for the heavinesse, and dulnesse of our hearts.</p>
                  <p>But because we are Baptized; and heare Sermons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we can make no man beleeve that he is asleepe.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us trie, and consider, whether those that heare the Word, and are Professors of the life of grace; those that are alreadie awakened, be not in such a fearefull slumber, as may well be called a sleepe.</p>
                  <p>First of all therefore, this is one marke of a man that is asleepe, <note place="margin">Signes of sleepie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</note> he heares not, he understands not the things that are spoken to him: so it is a marke of a sleepie heart and conscience, when a <note place="margin">1. Carelesnesse.</note> man heares not, nor understands the Word that hee doth heare: when he heares not that which is spoken. It is one judgement upon wicked men, the Booke of God is clasped to them: such a man reads, and heares, and discernes not. If the Booke be open, his heart is clasped fast, he takes no good by it. And this is not the least part of the miserie upon the Saints, that this booke is not so open to them, nor they doe not so understand it, nor discerne that which is in it as they might.</p>
                  <p>We heare the Word many of us many times, and we seeme to
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:14764:264"/>
receive it: but yet who is he that may not find in himselfe, that the sleepe and securitie of his mind and soule, makes him not much to attend and regard it? that he is not carefull and industrious in the keeping and maintaining of that hee heares, and the framing himselfe according to it? And so it comes to passe that it is with Gods word that we heare, as it is with Physick when it is given to a man that is dead, it workes not, or when he sleepes immediatly upon it: so when we heare the word of God, and fall into a sleepe upon it: into the sleepe and sluggishnesse of earthly cares, the Word is unprofitable, it workes not that effect that else it would.</p>
                  <p>Againe, a man that sleepes, you shall know it by this, he doth <note place="margin">2. When men intend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but sleepe.</note> not mind his ordinarie businesse; he neither troubles his head, nor his hands with it: his businesse sleepes with himselfe: he doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but sleepe while he is asleepe, he can doe nothing else. So hereby we may know our selves to be in a marvellous sleepe of sinne, when we give not our serious thoughts to God, and to the practice of pietie and godlinesse: it is an argument of sleepe and slumber in us. The mind of man should intend the principall thing for which God hath put us in the world: when we give not our thoughts to God, and mind not the things of Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it is a signe we are asleepe. When we move not, nor stirre not our hands and our feete in the wayes of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as we should, it proceeds from this sleepinesse and drowsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Whereas would we be wise for our selves, and awake as we should, <hi>wee should neither be idle, nor unfruitfull in the worke of the Lord.</hi> We should ever be doing something that might glorifie God, and further our owne reckoning. But this is a signe of a sleepie person, in the maine, and principall things, his heart is not upon them, his hands and feet move not in the wayes of God; he workes not to the principall end for which hee came into the world.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, you shall know a sleepie man by this, he knowes not <note place="margin">3. Wasting of time.</note> of the passing of the time; but so much time as he sleepes, he wastes, it is as the time of death to him; for what is sleepe but <hi>the shadow of death.</hi> Even so it is with many of us, that professe the teaching of Grace; Alas, how doe we waste time insensibly? and passe away the time: some decke away the time, some play away the time, dayes, and weekes, and moneths together, as if time were not made for some other businesse: as if we had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved time for such imployments as these, for our recreations, and sports, and pleasures: and not rather that we might further our repentance, and our reckoning, and helpe the servants of God, and get <hi>oyle in our lampes,</hi> and faith in our soules, and patience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the time of trouble, and get assurance of a blessed inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:14764:265"/>
when we shall be turned out hence. Time is given us for these ends; and yet we (silly men as we are) devise pastimes to our selves, as if our life did not passe away, whereas <hi>Iob</hi> saith, it is as <hi>a Weavers shuttle.</hi> Let us consider, brethren, time will passe, that we may improve it, and not wast our time.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and lastly, to conclude this point, a man that is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted <note place="margin">4. Decay of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heate.</note> immoderately to sleepe, you shall know it by this, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes naturall heate, and that being destroyed by immoderate sleepe, as by a sudden mightie shower, this man growes pursie, and fatte, and lazie, he growes idle, and unfit for the exercises of manhood, or of his Calling, and the like. So it is when a man is immoderatly, and excessively fast asleepe with the cares of this life, the lusts of his heart, the pleasures of this present world, or whatsoever it is that lulls him, and rocks this cradle: when he is thus asleepe, hee growes fatte and pursie, his naturall heate is gone, he falls from his first zeale, and affection, and desire, and practise.</p>
                  <p>Alas brethren, we may speake to the shame and sorrow of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (I doubt that heare me) that have exchanged their care of godlinesse; that have exchanged their seeking of God in the meanes, with company, with good-fellowship, with drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And let the Lords marriners come to them, and say <hi>Up sleeper, call upon thy God,</hi> why dost thou not <hi>doe thy first workes?</hi> Why art thou lazie? he growes angry as <hi>Ionas</hi> was, that thought he did <hi>well to bee angrie to the death.</hi> This is the miserie of many that live under the teaching of the Gospell; in the light of the Gospell. This is another marke, and a signe of sleepe, when we cannot abide of any thing to be wakened.</p>
                  <p>To draw to a conclusion: the last use of this point, it serves to <note place="margin">Exhortation to awake from sleepe.</note> rouze, and to raise us from this sleepe, and securitie; this slumber that is in the best of us. And know my brethren, I speake not now to those that are out of the Church, and those that are noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously wicked, those that are scandalous, and rebellious to good counsell: but I speake to those that live in the bosome of the Church, those that professe goodnesse and godlinesse; yea, those that are Disciples, and are neere the side of Christ: let this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be to them to raise, and rouze themselves out of this sleepe. <hi>It is time,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>that wee rise out of sleepe.</hi> The summe of this exhortation I will propound, and then draw to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>
                  <p>First, consider how unprofitable a man, a Christian man is, <note place="margin">1. It is unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</note> when he is asleepe: What is a man when he is asleepe? but that there is hope of awaking, and to come to the actions of life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, a man that is asleepe, he lives but the life of a Plant, there is nothing but being and nourishment: a waking beast is more
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:14764:265"/>
profitable, but that (I say) there is hope that afterwards hee will awake. So when we sleepe, and slumber, and tumble, and tosse our selves in dead securitie, how unprofitable are we to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and to our owne selves? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that <hi>Onesimus</hi> was unprofitable before his conversion: but now, saith he, <hi>hee is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table both to thee and mee.</hi> A man that is asleepe, is unprofitable: and certainly he that is asleepe in securitie and sinne, this man is most unprofitable to Gods glorie, and to his owne soule.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, consider when a man sleepes, and slumbers in sinne, <note place="margin">2. It unfit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> for dutie.</note> how unfit he is for any Christian dutie and exercise, for the maine parts of Godlinesse and Christianitie? How unfit is a sleepie man for the actions of life, and of his calling? and how unfit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and indisposed is a man that slepes in sinne, to the actions of spirituall life? There be some maine parts and branches of our generall Calling, to which this sleepe makes us unable.</p>
                  <p>The first of them is the exercise of godlinesse, the maine thing <note place="margin">1. Exercise.</note> in the profession of a Christian to exercise himselfe in godlinesse: how unfit is a sleepie Christian for this? who sees a man that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe that workes in his Calling that can doe any good in it? So how can a Christian exercise himselfe in the actions of his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Calling, when he sleepes? in his praying, in his hearing, in his reading? if these duties be done coldly, what are they worth? Actions that are done in a mans sleepe, they come to nothing: so a man that sleepes in sinne, let him doe never so many good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are of no value.</p>
                  <p>A second maine branch of our Christian Calling, is the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <note place="margin">2. Combate.</note> combate, to fight against our corruptions. Now alas how unfit is a sleepie man, either to expect, or to repell an enemie? when he is asleepe hee lies open to all disadvantage. <hi>Sisera</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, a strong and noble Captaine, was so weake, that a silly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Iael</hi> slew him when he was asleepe: therefore we know this part of our Christian calling cannot hold as long as wee sleepe in sinne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, another part, and maine branch of Christianitie is to <note place="margin">3. To wait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> our Masters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> expect our Masters returne, to waite for the comming of our Lord, that we may enjoy that sweet blessednesse that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and made us expect and waite for: now how unfit is a slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie man to waite for his Masters comming? to set things in order? Thus we see in these particular maine duties of Christianitie they cannot be performed by men that are asleep, therfore we had need to wake our selves: if we will either honour God, or profit our selves, if will be fit to doe service to God, or to his Church, wee must keepe our selves awake, especially in the maine duties of Christianitie. <note place="margin">3. Our enemie sleepes not.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, consider while we sleepe, and are secure, the enemie
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:14764:266"/>
never sleepes, he is then most watchfull against us. We may sleep, and thinke we doe well enough to take our ease, but Satan sleepes not; we have a watchfull enemie to deale with.</p>
                  <p>And then he hath some advantage by our sleeping; in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. in that Parable, <hi>The enemie sowes tares, while men slept:</hi> hee comes <note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> into the field of the heart, where the word of God, the good seed is sowne, and what doth he doe there? he sowes a croppe of thornes, and they make the heart of a Christian, like the field of <hi>Solomons</hi> sluggard, <hi>Prov. 24. I passed by the field of the sluggard, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>it was all thornes,</hi> &amp;c. Thus is the heart that is neglected of a man that is sleepie, and secure in sinne. When doe robbers and theeves assault the house? In the dead time of the night, when they may take men at advantage, in their first sleepe, then they come and breake into the house. Shall theeves and burglaries watch at midnight to breake the house, and cut mens throates, and wilt not thou watch to save thy selfe?</p>
                  <p>Further consider, as the enemie never sleepes, so Gods mercy never sleepes, Gods mercie is ever watching over us, to doe us <note place="margin">4. Gods mercie sleepes not.</note> good; and it watcheth to keepe us watchfull: for what should all the mercies of God doe to us, but keepe us watchfull? Our God that we serve is not as <hi>Baal,</hi> the God of Idolaters, <hi>perhaps hee is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe, and must be awaked, or hee is chasing his adversaries;</hi> No, no, the <hi>strength that keepes Israel, slumbers not, nor sleepes.</hi> Therefore let not Israel slumber nor sleepe: because God watcheth over his children, let them watch with him, and keepe themselves neere to him.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, if this will not move thee, then consider as Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie <note place="margin">5. Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments sleepe not.</note> sleepes not; so Gods judgements sleepe not. That man that sleepes in sinne, let him know that Gods judgements sleepe not. As <hi>Balaam</hi> when he was out of the way, the Angell watcheth him, and catcheth him in this corner, and in that corner; he could goe into no corner, but the Angell with his drawne sword was ready to meet him, and to slay him. And the Apostle saith of those that were led away by false teachers; <hi>Their damnation sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not.</hi> Gods judgements are alway waking: thou maist sleepe on both sides in sinne, but Gods justice sleepeth not. And thou that art the Lords, if thou sleepe, know that correction, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement sleepeth not, and they will awake thee, thou wert bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to awake by slighter meanes.</p>
                  <p>To conclude all, consider that all of us, there is no man upon <note place="margin">6. We are all to meet death.</note> the earth, but we are all going to meet the mortall sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>epe of death; and if we shall when that meets us, have our owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences tell us, that we have also a spirituall sleepe within us; that we carrie a spirituall sleepe to meet that mortall sleepe, what a miserable, and mournfull state will that be? when the heart of a
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:14764:266"/>
man or woman that is comming to die, shall say, and speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loude, and witnesse against his Master, O, thou hast beene a slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish and sleepie Christian: thou hast had good meanes, but thou hast not kept thy watch, thou wouldest sleepe doe what the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations of the Word could, thou wouldest be a drowsie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. Hence it comes to passe that so many, when on their death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed they come to grapple with that mortall sleepe, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science proclaimes against them, then they crie, Oh that I had but one day, but one houre more, that I might waken, <hi>and strengthen the things that are readie to die,</hi> and that it might be better with me then it is. But alas now their short day is past, and one perpetuall night to come, and now it is too late, as it proves many times. Therefore let not time goe, but know that that mournfull day must come upon us, we must meet that mortall sleepe: Let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to shake off spirituall sleepe, drowsinesse of spirit, and make our peace in the meane time, that conscience may witnesse with us, and for us at the day of death, and judgement. Let us labour to be watchfull, and desire to be readie for the Lord, and to have our accounts readie for him. This shall suffice for the words.</p>
                  <p>Now for our occasion: because this is my first occasion of this kind, I must enter with a preface, and that is this: that as I have ever beene in the course of my ministerie, so I shall bee very spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the praise of the dead, because I know that these exercises are appointed for the instructing of the living, and the consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those that survive, and not for the praise, and commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the dead.</p>
                  <p>Besides, I know, and see by daily experience every where, how few there be that in their life time deserve the praise of Religion in their death. For my part I never did, nor never will gild a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten post, or a mudde wall, or give false witnesse in praising; to give the praise of Religion to those that deserve it not. I desire those of my congregation would make their owne <hi>Funerall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> while they be living, by their vertuous life, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. As the Apostle saith, <hi>Hee hath not praise, that is praised of men: but hee that is praised of God.</hi>

                        <p>After these things, the word of the Lord came to <hi>Abraham,</hi> saying: Feare not <hi>Abraham,</hi> I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE tender mercie of God is seene in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, then in afflicting his owne people, for hee proportions his chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not to our deserts, but to our strength: and you shall ordinarily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, where Almightie GOD layes a heavie affliction, hee gives an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie assistance; when he leades any of his people through a hote fire, hee is with them in extraordinarie manner.</p>
                  <p>This holy Saint, <hi>(Abraham)</hi> as hee was the Father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, so he was a Patterne to all the faithfull in both these, both in
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:14764:269"/>
his tryalls, and in Gods assistance. There was never any man cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to more tryalls then he: to leave his Countrey, and his Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and his Fathers house; and after to sacrifice his owne sonne. And there was never any man more assisted from God; as we see in those many apparitions that God vouchsafed him: Comforting him, sometimes in dreames and visions. Sometimes hee appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him in an admirable, and most friendly manner talking with him, as a man doth with his friend. One of them are in this Chapter; <hi>The Lord appeared to Abraham,</hi> and comforted him in the middest of his tryals, and troubles.</p>
                  <p>Where you may see an admirable incouragement that God gives to his servant <hi>Abraham;</hi> You may note, <note place="margin">Parts of the Text.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, the incouragement it selfe; that is, <hi>not to feare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, note the time, when God gave him this incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: when he had encountred with those Kings immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as we see in Chapter 14. And when hee was to encounter with many evils and troubles after, <hi>then the Lord appeared to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, note the manner, how God is pleased to reveale this comfort; that is, by way of vision: <hi>God appeared</hi> by vision.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, note the ground of this comfort, and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that God gives him, and that is taken from a twofold Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
                  <p>First, what God was to him, in regard of any evills, that hee did feele, or feare, he was his <hi>shield</hi> to beare them off. Secondly, in regard of all the good things that <hi>Abraham</hi> could lose in the world, <hi>an exceeding great reward:</hi> hee would bee to him all in all. So you see this portion of Scripture affords plentifull matter for instruction, and consolation. All that I will speake of at this time, I will wind up in this proposition; that is, that</p>
                  <p>They that are in covenant with God, and labour to keepe his covenant <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Propos.</hi> They that are in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, may bee without car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall feare.</note> 
                     <hi>(as faithfull</hi> Abraham <hi>was, and did)</hi> they may be a people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all carnall, and inordinate feare.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Abraham</hi> felt much, and had just cause to expect more, but in the middest of all, God appeared to him, and bid him he should not feare. And what was spoken to <hi>Abraham,</hi> is spoken to us: for he was the Father of the faithfull, and they <hi>that are of the faith with Abraham, are blessed with him.</hi> So then the blessing of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and all the incouragements that were given to him, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to him only, but to all that are the spirituall seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> to all the faithfull: so that the Proposition is not limitted to him, but extends to all.</p>
                  <p>A Doctrine, if ever needfull, it is now. Wee know how it is with all men that are out of Covenant with God. <hi>Adam</hi> as soone as he had sinned, he runnes from God, he was afraid, and hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:14764:269"/>
from the face of God: so every unregenerate man is (except his conscience be ignorant, in a dead sleepe, and cauterized:) for he seeth God on the one side a revenging Judge: and hee knowes himselfe on the other side to be guiltie, and therefore hee cannot but with amazement and feare continually tremble before God: and he desires if it were possible, that there were no God at all, that he might never be called to account for his doings. But now the child of God, a faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> that is in covenant with God, he may in the middest of all evills lift up his head with joy and comfort, even when wicked men are at their wits end, and know not whether to turne themselves.</p>
                  <p>It is (I say) a point needfull to urge in these times, wherein we heare abroad of warres, and rumours of warres, and so many distractions: and what they feele, we have cause to feare: but now it is seasonable at this time, when we see the <hi>King of feares</hi> act his part before our eyes: hee that the Philosophers call, the most terrible of all terribles; that is, Death, that tends to the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and abolition of nature, in regard of our being here. I say there cannot be a better argument treated of, then somewhat that may fence us against the feare of this evill.</p>
                  <p>Now for the opening of this point.</p>
                  <p>First, consider what <hi>feare</hi> is;</p>
                  <p>And then what <hi>feare</hi> a Christian should be freed from.</p>
                  <p>And then how it comes to passe that a Christian is exempted from all slavish, and inordinate feare.</p>
                  <p>And then come to make some Use of it to the present occasion. <note place="margin">1. What feare is.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, that we may know the point the better, let us consider, what <hi>feare</hi> is in generall; And <hi>feare</hi> (beloved) <hi>is</hi> such <hi>an affection or passion of the soule that is stirred up with a through apprehension of some future evill, that is very difficult to be resisted by the partie, or patient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is an affection, or passion of the soule: for it makes a reall transmutation in the man.</p>
                  <p>It is such an affection as is stirred up with the apprehension of evill: for evill is properly the object of feare: we doe not prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily feare any thing that is good, except the losse of it, and it is ill to lose any good thing.</p>
                  <p>Againe, it is evill future: for if the evill be present, we grieve, and not feare.</p>
                  <p>And it is such an evill as is difficult, and hard to resist, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with patience: for if it be a small evill that is easily conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, you contemne it, you feare it not. You see then what feare is in generall.</p>
                  <p>Is all feare prohibited?</p>
                  <p>Not the feare of God, &amp;c. Feare is oft commanded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <note place="margin">Kindes of feare.</note> know then there are divers kindes of feare.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="520" facs="tcp:14764:270"/>
First, naturall feare, and that is called naturall either in regard <note place="margin">1. Naturall.</note> of the materiall or efficient cause.</p>
                  <p>When the partie that doth feare, is phlegmatick, or melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and so is naturally inclined to feare, this may be called a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall feare.</p>
                  <p>Or, in regard of the object, when there is somewhat in that which is destructive to nature: and therefore the feare of death, it is naturall to man, and so whatsoever may prejudice nature.</p>
                  <p>Now this naturall feare is an affection that Almightie God concreated with the soule, it is naturally good, it is morally neither good nor evill, but according as it is determined by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</p>
                  <p>Againe, there is a carnall evill feare, namely, when a man feares <note place="margin">2. Carnal feare.</note> the evill of punishment, more then the evill of sin; a corporall evill more then a spirituall: a temporall more then an eternall. Hee is afraid of losing something hee enjoyes, or of not getting something he desires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In either regards there may be a carnall feare, as I shall explaine it to you more anone: and this so farre as it is carnall is ever to be condemned.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is a servile feare: and this is such a feare as <note place="margin">3. Servile feare.</note> lookes at the punishment only, and not at the sinne: when a man is afraid of the judgements of GOD, and never feares sinne, that is the cause of it. And so withall, when this feare is only servile, and is retained in the heart, that man desires still to sinne; there is a love of sinne, a wishing that God would give him leave to sinne, and let loose the reynes to him: that if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible there were no God, no Devill, no Heaven, nor Hell, that he might sinne freely. And if he abstaine from sinne at any time, the cause is, that there is this punishment that is the consequent of sinne, and not out of love to God, or obedience to his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>
                  <p>Now this servile feare, though in it selfe it bee not savingly pleasing to God, yet it is a thing that is good, as S. <hi>Austin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves: for that man that feares servily, hee doth that which is good, though he doth it not well: because that is a thing that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the disposition, and will of him that doth the thing, though the thing be good as farre as it goes. It is good for the restraining of evill men from outrages in the world, and it is a preparative in the way to conversion, as it is <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <note place="margin">Act 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, there is a filiall son-like feare, that ariseth out of the consideration of the greatnesse, and especially of the goodnesse <note place="margin">4. Filiall feare.</note> of God, whereby a man so hates punishment, as hee hates sinne also the cause of it.</p>
                  <p>Now there are divers degrees of filiall feare.</p>
                  <p>One degree we call innitiall feare in this world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="521" facs="tcp:14764:270"/>
And a degree of perfection in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>In this world the feare we have, hath one eye upon the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and another eye upon the commandement, or love of God. And here many make a doubt, whether they are to doe that which is good, having an eye to the recompence of reward, or to abstaine from evill out of the feare of punishment.</p>
                  <p>For answer briefly. Any thing almightie God hath made a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to us, to incourage us to doe well, or to deterre us from evill; we may make a motive to our selves, and as long as we doe so, we doe well. It was so with <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice, this was propovnded as a motive; <hi>In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt die.</hi> Then to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from the forbidden fruit, partly out of feare of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if <hi>Adam</hi> did so, he did well. So, every one of us, in regard of any evill, we may have an eye to the punishment, that will bee the consequent of the thing: For Christ urgeth this to his owne Disciples, <hi>Feare not him that can kill the body,</hi> &amp;c. And to doe things meerely without any respect to punishment at all; I know no reason why any man should aspire to that perfection. For God while we are here, hath given us these motives, to stirre us up to avoid evill; and it is well if wee can heartily and truly, out of love to God doe it, by all the motives that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
                  <p>To have a feare meerely for punishment, and still to retaine the love of sinne, and no respect or love to the commandement of God, this is not acceptable to God in a saving manner: but to have an eye to God, and to abstaine from sinne, partly out of love to God, and partly out of feare of punishment, this is acceptable to God. For a man must love himselfe in subordination to the love of God; and therefore he may looke to the avoiding of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and to the getting of good eternall to soule and body.</p>
                  <p>Now these feares, we may consider of them thus. The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall feare may be accompanied with the Spirit, but it comes not from the Spirit, that must be ordered by the word of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, carnall feare comes not from the spirit, nor is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with it: this is ever to be mortified, this wee must take heed of; and this feare <hi>Abraham</hi> is exhorted against here.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the feare that is servile, it comes from the spirit, but it is not accompanied with the spirit. As the dawning of the day the Sunne is the cause of it, yet the Sunne is not present when the day dawnes, but some glimpse goes before him: this wee must cherish, so as we bring it to filiall feare, and then wee deale aright in that.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, for filiall feare, we must cherish that at all times, wee must labour to get still a more reverent respect of the Majestie of God. So I have breiefly shewed you what feare is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="522" facs="tcp:14764:271"/>
And what feare wee must labour to be freed from; all slavish and carnall feare, in regard of the world, or any thing in the world; any ill that may befall us, or any good that may be taken from us. Now you see that a Christian is such a man as may live without all feare, that is carnall; <hi>Feare not them that can kill the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> And in <hi>Isaiah 8. 12. Feare not their feare.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isay 8. 12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is the ground of this?</p>
                  <p>I will tell you briefly: Christ came into the world to <hi>deliver us from</hi> all <hi>our enemies,</hi> that <hi>wee might serve him without feare, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> We are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from our enemies either. Luke 1. 47.</note> 
                     <hi>and righteousnesse,</hi> Luke 1. 47. So then the ground is this, that man that hath no enemies; that man that cannot possibly be molested with any evill, what need hee feare? For there is no evill in the world that can surprize a man that is in covenant with God, that labours to keepe his covenant, but by the power of the Spirit he may conquer it. For only evill, and evill future is the object of feare. Now, if there be no evill that can befall a child of God, but such as may be conquered, hee should contemne it, and not feare it. Now all the enemies of a Christian are either reconciled, or conquered and foyled, and what then need he feare them?</p>
                  <p>For God that is an enemie to every man naturally, he is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled; <note place="margin">1. By reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</note> Christ hath made our peace with God, hee hath made our attonement, we need not feare him slavishly: though wee may, and must feare him with a filiall feare, we must not bee afraid of him with horrour, as to runne from him; but wee must so love him, as to <hi>reveren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>e before his foot-stoole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, in regard of the evills of the world, they are enemies too: but how? Christ hath beene pleased to sweeten these to us: <hi>all things in the world</hi> (saith the Apostle, speaking of afflictions, <hi>Rom. 8.) they worke for good to them that feare God.</hi> Shall a man be afraid of his owne good? Nay, there is nothing in the world that more workes our good, then afflictions, and losses, and cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: we might spare any thing better then them: shall we be afraid of that that workes our good? Death it is reconciled, and made our friend: It was the greatest enemie; Christ hath pulled out the sting, and changed the nature of it; he hath made it the birth-day of eternitie, a sweet passage to a better life. Death brings not evill to a man that is in covenant with God, but rather terminates all evill, that he is molested with in the world. So then some ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are reconciled and made our friends, and these wee have no reason to feare.</p>
                  <p>Againe, there are some that are irreconcileable, and they are conquered and overcome. The Divell will never be friends with <note place="margin">2. By conquest.</note> us, therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christ <hi>hath spoyled principalities and powers;</hi> and trampled Satan under-feet: and now if he walke about, yet hee is
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:14764:271"/>
in his chayne, he can bite, but he can hurt none but those that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly betray themselves into his hands.</p>
                  <p>For sinne, it is of a condemning nature; but those that are in covenant with God, and walke with him, it is <hi>removed as farre from them as the East is from the West,</hi> it is throwne into the bottomelesse sea of Gods mercy, so that it shall never anger God or hurt us any more then if we had not committed it; <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay more, God hath bestowed his Spirit, whereby hee hath freede our hearts, and whereby if a man labour to <hi>stirre up the grace of God in him,</hi> and to walke comfortably as he might in the presence of God, he might through the power of God free his heart from these horrours and feares; for saith the Apostle, <hi>yee have not received the Spirit of bondage to feare againe: but yee have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby wee cry Abba Father.</hi> The Spirit of bondage casts downe the soule with horrour and feare, but wee have the Spirit of God to assure us that wee have God for our Father reconciled in Christ, and so by consequent that our sinnes are pardoned, that death is overcome, that <hi>Principalities and powers are spoyled,</hi> and <hi>all things</hi> in the world, (though contrary in themselves yet) they <hi>shall worke for our good.</hi> So you see the ground of it, a Christian hath no enemies, some enemies are reconciled and others are trampled under foote that they cannot hurt him. And wee receive this freedome by the Spirit of God, that if wee would stirre it up, and labour to walke as becommeth Christians we may make our lives very comfortable.</p>
                  <p>Briefly for Application.</p>
                  <p>First, let us all take notice of the command that God gives to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. The power of grace must reflect on a mans selfe.</note> 
                     <hi>Abraham,</hi> of this incouragement, and make use of it to our selves; and know that the power of grace, and Religion must reflect upon a mans selfe. He (beloved) shall be accounted the best Christian before God, and in the sight of judicious men, whose Religion is practicall, and reflects upon himselfe. Now there are many busie ones in the world, that meddle with the conversations of others, and are still talking, and complayning of things without them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but surely, he is a happie man that reformes himselfe, and that sets in tune his owne affections and passions: as this in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, to labour to be without slavish and inordinate feare. Alas wee may complaine of many that finde fault with many things, but if they looke within, there is a combustion of a great many unruly affections, and passions, and these are the things we never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of: wee finde not fault with our selves as wee should, wee should take notice of the Law of God that it is spirituall, to set in order our hearts and mindes and soules, as well as our tongues and hands. The law of man reacheth but to the outward man, if a man
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:14764:272"/>
keepe himselfe in order in regard of these, thought is free, and the Law doth not take hold of a man for his affections, but the Law God doth, therefore you know that <hi>lusting after a woman,</hi> in Gods account is reputed <hi>adultery,</hi> the <hi>hating of a mans brother in his heart is accounted manslaughter;</hi> he is accounted a <hi>murtherer that hates his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> so he that is <hi>angry unadvisedly,</hi> you know what he is in danger of: and that man is accounted guiltie before God, that cannot order his affections in regard of those unruly passions that are within him. This I observe by the way. God in Scripture takes especial notice of it; &amp; I am perswaded it is an infallible distinguishing character be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an hypocrite &amp; a sincere child of God: an hypocrite labours to wash the outside, hee hath a demure countenance, cleane hands, smooth language; &amp;c. these things are good, but he goes no further, he makes no conscience of secret contemplative wickednesse, of the lusts of his heart, and the thoughts of his minde: these things he never enters into himselfe to mortifie. But that man that is conscionable, so walkes with God; as that a wrie affection, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward lust after somewhat that is evill, troubles him, and humbles him before God: the vanitie of his thoughts in secret cause him to mourne before God: this is a signe of a man that walkes before God, and accounts <hi>God a Spirit that searcheth the hearts and tryeth the reynes:</hi> and therefore if ever wee will approve our selves to God, let our Religion bee practicall, and reflect upon our selves, and among other things upon our inward man to set that in order.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by way of instruction, we see what happy men and women we might be if we were not our owne foes. If wee could <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Possible to live with out feare:</note> attaine this pitch to live without feare that nothing should trouble us, were it not a happy condition? surely it is a thing feazeable, some Saints have attained it in a great measure; you know <hi>David</hi> when <hi>Ziglag</hi> was taken, his wives gone, all the spoyle taken, and the people were ready to stone him, what did poore <hi>David?</hi> hee can <hi>incourage himselfe in the Lord his God</hi> notwithstanding this. So it may be with a poore Christian, his friends may forsake him; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the world is gone, <hi>riches take to themselves wings,</hi> it may bee his body is crazie, and all things are out of order, yet this man can <hi>incourage himselfe in the Lord his God,</hi> he can say to himselfe <hi>feare not.</hi> Saith <hi>Daved, though I walke in the valley of the shadow of death,</hi> a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full condition, <hi>yet I will feare none ill, Psal.</hi> 23. And in another place, <hi>though ten thousand should compasse mee in on every side I would lay mee</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psalme 23.</note> 
                     <hi>downe and rest.</hi> Though the Apostles were watched by souldiers, layd in the stocks, and for ought they knew the next day should be brought to execution, yet they sing as merrily and sleepe as heartily as if they had beene on a Throne, and had beene Kings in a Pallace. Thus a good conscience will make a Christian happy, if he be not his owne foe: but our hearts are intangled with the
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:14764:272"/>
world and wordly things, that for the most part wee see not this priviledge. But I leave that.</p>
                  <p>Next it may serve to reprehend and chide the most of us, yea, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Reproofe for inordinate feare.</note> all, in that we are distracted with feares unnecessary, such as spend our spirits, and consume our precious time, such things as make our lives uncomfortable, and dishonour God, and our Religion and profession, and all to no purpose.</p>
                  <p>Some things we feare a great while before wee neede, perhaps <note place="margin">1. We feare too soone.</note> that we neede not feare at all. One saith Lord, what would become of me if I should loose my wife? if I should loose my children? or loose my estate? What would become of me if the times should be hard, if there should be a deare yeare? I can scarse bring both ends together now.</p>
                  <p>Another saith, what shall I doe when I am old, and cannot take paines for my living? thus men feare a thousand inconveniences. What neede wee meete evills halfe way? what neede wee create to our selves such troubles? <hi>sufficient for the day are the troubles of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in regard of carnall feare, all things make us afraid more <note place="margin">2. Too much.</note> then we neede, and the feare of ill oft times perplexeth a man more then the ill it selfe that lights upon him. And men of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly disposition they frame to themselves such strange Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera's, Imaginations of things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that perhaps shall never come to passe, and so trouble themselves with a great deale of feare. Thou art afraid of such and such losses, perhaps thou maiest die first, and such things perhaps shall never befall thee: labour to prepare thy heart before hand, and then feare them not.</p>
                  <p>I will shew you the inconveniences of this, briefly.</p>
                  <p>First of all, these feares of losses and crosses and the like, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">1. It brings a great deale of ill.</note> bring a great deale of ill to men; nay it brings a great deale of ill as the naturall event and consequent of it, partly by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, <hi>Esay 66. 4. I will bring their feares upon them.</hi> And that <hi>that wicked men feare shall come upon them.</hi> This is the way to <note place="margin">Esay 66. 4.</note> bring ill upon them, when men will needs bee miserable is it not just with God they should?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Romans will come and take away our Empire,</hi> and so it was. <hi>Saul</hi> was afraid that <hi>David</hi> should succeede him, and so hee did. When men will not learne to live by faith, it is just with God to bring that that they feare upon them, because they dishonour him by unbeliefe.</p>
                  <p>In the second place it not onely brings ill but it makes the heart <note place="margin">2. It unfits the heart to beare evil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> unfit for ill when it comes. <hi>In the feare of man there is a snare: but in the confidence of the Lord, there is a sure reward.</hi> In the feare of man there is a snare: what doth feare doe? it insnares a man, it binds a man hand and foote, and layes him flat before his enemie when
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:14764:273"/>
he comes, and then his enemy tramples upon him. It so weakens the Spirits and disheartneth a man before it comes, that when it comes he is no way able to beare it. For the feare takes away all the joy and content that a man may take in the present good that hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes at the hand of God, that he cannot enjoy that, because hee feares I know not what ill that may come; and then when that ill comes he is not able to beare it, his spirit is so weake.</p>
                  <p>I might shew much hurt that this feare doth both to the soule, and to the body of man.</p>
                  <p>To the body of man, how doth it weaken and contract the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits? and bring diseases? and some times death it selfe? <note place="margin">It hurts the body.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Feare doth much hurt to the soule.</p>
                  <p>Naturally.</p>
                  <p>Spiritually. <note place="margin">It doth hurt to the soule.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Naturally, it weakens a man in regard of the operations of his soule, that the body is not a fit instrument for the soule to <note place="margin">1. Naturally.</note> worke by. It makes a man doe diverse things rashly and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately and divers things out of incogitancie, that hee knowes not what he doth; he is unfit for holy duties, unstable in all his wayes.</p>
                  <p>As he is thus in regard of his place and calling, so in regard of the duties of Gods service, he cannot doe these with a quiet heart, <note place="margin">2. Spiritually.</note> with a peaceable spirit while he is possest with these feares.</p>
                  <p>You shall see almost all the sinnes in the world come from this feare. What was the reason that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> did equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate? was it not feare (in that particular) of men more then God? <note place="margin">Feare the ground of most sinnes.</note> and so they put God upon a miracle to preserve <hi>Saraahs</hi> chastitie in the case of <hi>Abimeleck.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What was the reason that <hi>Aaron</hi> yeelded to make an Idoll for the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> and so joyned in Idolatry with them? he was afraid of the people that they might doe him some hurt, he durst not trust God with his preservation.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Peter</hi> denyed his Master out of feare; What is the reason that a Minister doth not sometimes reproove sinne? that a Magistrate doth not sometimes reforme that that is amisse? It is slavish feare they will not trust God to maintaine them in his owne cause. What is the reason that many servants lye, &amp;c. it is out of a slavish feare of their masters.</p>
                  <p>And so in regard of the things of the world, men are inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately afraid that they shall loose somewhat they possesse, and therefore they take indirect courses. Still this slavish feare, and horrour and distrust of God it is almost the cause of all sin, as wee may observe in the world.</p>
                  <p>This being so prejudicall; in the last place, let us fence our <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 4. To fence our hearts against it.</note> hearts against this feare. By this meanes we shall honour Religion,
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:14764:273"/>
and make our lives comfortable, incourage other Saints of God, and draw people to like Religion, when it yeelds such sweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to the soules of men.</p>
                  <p>For doe but once againe muster together all our enemies, and <note place="margin">No cause of feare.</note> see if we have cause of feare.</p>
                  <p>For our spirituall enemies: Will any man feare a wounded foe? <note place="margin">1. Of spirituall enemies.</note> for the Lord God hath wounded Satan, and trampled him under our feet, and brought us as <hi>Ioshua</hi> did his Captaines, to set our feet upon the necke of principalities, and powers, that through the mightie power of God, <hi>wee are more then conquerours,</hi> and shall we feare such an enemie as this? Shall we feare those sinnes that we are humbled for, and which God hath made as if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beene?</p>
                  <p>For the evills of the world: Why should we feare them? those <note place="margin">2. Of worldly evills.</note> corrections that are immediatly from God, there is no cause of feare in them. As thus: If God take away thy Wife, or thy Child, or thy friend, or a part of thy substance, what cause of feare is there: <hi>Feare not</hi> (saith God) <hi>I will chastise thee in measure, and will not make a full end of thee</hi> (Jer. 46. 28.) <hi>yet thou shalt not bee</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 46. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>altogether uncorrected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then remember, God proportions the correction to our strength, as a Father, not as a Judge: hee aymes at our amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not at our ruine; If hee take away a friend, that wee doted too much on: if we set our mindes too much on the world, and worldly things, God will deprive us of them, and so by this bee all in all to us, and draw us neerer to himselfe: have wee cause of feare? to feare that that comes from God?</p>
                  <p>No; will some say, if we fall into the hands of God there is <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> mercie, but the mercies of men are cruell. What if unreasonable men deale with us, have wee not reason to feare ill from them? they are outragious and cruell, they bend their malice against us; and if the enemie should come and make an iroad into our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and bring devastation, what should we doe then?</p>
                  <p>I answer, first in all things that fall from men, there is a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <note place="margin">Answ.</note> hand of God: therefore saith our Saviour to his Apostles when he would incourage them, saith hee, there is a providence even concerning sparrowes, <hi>there is none of them light on the ground</hi> without the providence of God. So, when he would encourage his Disciples against their adversaries, <hi>your very haires are numbred.</hi> As if he had said, Almightie God knowes how many haires eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man hath upon his head; he numbers all our joynts, hee tells our steps: there is nothing befalls us, but what the provident hand of God is in. And wicked men, the Divell and all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, God hath them in a chaine, they cannot goe one step further then he gives them leave.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="528" facs="tcp:14764:274"/>
Againe, consider what God said to <hi>Abraham</hi> here; <hi>I am thy shield.</hi> In regard of all the evills that men attempt against us, whether in regard of scoffing, or persecution, and open hostilitie, or whatsoever, God is our sheild. And the Psalmist calls him else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>our strong tower.</hi> You know how it is, if men encounter a strong Tower, the enemie must first batter the Tower about their eares before they can hurt the men. If a man fight with an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, he must pierce his shield before he can hurt the man. Wee may speake it with sacred reverence to the Majestie of God, they must overcome God himselfe, before they can hurt his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in doing any thing that shall prove in the event hurtfull, as long as they keepe close to God.</p>
                  <p>The Lord intimated this to the people of Israell: The Egipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans marched, and followed hard after them, to devoure them with open mouth, God when he saw that, hee removes the pillar of the Cloud, and set it betweene them: as if God should have said to them, You deceive your selves, to thinke to conquer my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, you must conquer me, before you conquer them. So God is our strong Tower, our shieid, and our deliverer, and hee will find deliverance for his people some way or other, from the evill, or in the evill, or out of it; as shall turne to our exceeding advantage.</p>
                  <p>For, suppose the worst that can bee supposed, that wicked men are let loose on us, to doe all that their malice can invent, they can but touch the body, the shell of the soule, and let the prisoner out of dores. Upon this argument Christ incourageth us; <hi>Feare not them that can kill the body, but feare him that can kill both body and soule.</hi> As if hee should say, Doe the enemies threaten death, they promise you life: the greatest advantage, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest day that ever can befall a man that is in covenant with God, is the day of death. Then all they can doe, is to kill the body for a while, which God will raise, maugre the malice of the Divell, and all his instruments, and possesse the soule of that blisse that is prepared for it.</p>
                  <p>And in regard of Death, why should we feare that? if we bee in covenant with God, the nature of it is changed, the sting is out, and it is become beneficiall.</p>
                  <p>But you know the Saints die still. <note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The red Sea swallowed up the Egyptians, but contrariwise to <note place="margin">Answ.</note> the Israelites, it was a wall of protection on the right hand, and on the left. That then that was the ruine of the Egiptians, it was the protection of the Israelites.</p>
                  <p>So, it is in regard of death, that that is the entrance to the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miserie of evill men, that is the most blissfull and joyfull day to a child of God that can be, for then he <hi>rests from his labours, and his workes follow him.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="529" facs="tcp:14764:274"/>
But notwithstanding all this, it is hard to live without feare, <note place="margin">Quest.</note> I enjoy many things, I am afraid to lose them, and my children are afraid, and loath to part with me, my heart wavers, and is full of perplexitie, how shall I be freed from this?</p>
                  <p>I know, feare is a naturall thing deeply rooted in nature, thinke <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> How to get the conquest of feare.</note> not to get the conquest wholly, but by little and little.</p>
                  <p>Labour to get the Spirit of God that is supernaturall, that must overcome this: for the strongest resolution of the most resolved <note place="margin">1. Labour for the spirit.</note> spirit in the world will not overcome it, it must bee by a power that is stronger then our owne, namely by the Spirit of GOD, that we being assured by the Spirit, that God is our portion, and living the life of faith, we may not feare any thing in regard of this world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, labour to keepe our covenant with God: there is an <note place="margin">2. Keepe cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God. Num. 14. 9.</note> admonition, <hi>Numb. 14. 9. Only,</hi> (saith God) <hi>remember you doe not rebell against God, and then feare not this people: for God is with you, but hee hath forsaken them. The righteous is bold as a Lyon, but the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked feares, and oft-times where there is no feare.</hi> What is the reason we are so faint-hearted? that we feare the losse of the things of this world? because we are not assured that God is our portion: for if a man were assured, that what hee loseth here, God would make up in regard of his presence, that hee would be <hi>All in all,</hi> in stead of wife, and goods, and children, and honours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that this man should feare the losse of any thing: for hee possesseth all in God, and he cannot be lost.</p>
                  <p>In particular labour to strengthen faith, make God our strong <note place="margin">3. Strengthen faith. Psal. 112.</note> Tower, and live by faith, <hi>hee shall not be afraid of ill tydings;</hi> why? <hi>his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord,</hi> Psal. 112, When men make the things of this world their portion; when they make riches, and <hi>the arme of flesh</hi> their portion, that they must relie upon; here is a reed that will either breake, or pierce a mans hand. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that this man feares in all occasions, and extremities, because he forsakes the Lord, and cleaves to the creature. But that man that lives by faith is without feare; As <hi>Peter</hi> when hee began to sinke, saith Christ, <hi>Why dost thou feare? O thou of little faith.</hi> The reason he did sinke was feare, and why did hee feare? because his faith failed him, he did not lay hold upon God, and Christ.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, let us remember to order our selves aright, in regard <note place="margin">4. To place our love aright. <hi>August.</hi>
                     </note> of our love, and this will keepe us from inordinate feare. For we must conceive that love is the fountaine of all other affections; we love things, and therefore we desire them, if they be absent, and wee rejoyce in them if they be present, and wee feare the losse of them, to be abridged of them. Now let us order our love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, in regard of the things of this world, and wee shall never feare much: for it is the observation of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> we feare to lose
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:14764:275"/>
somewhat that we have attained, or not to enjoy somewhat that we desire; so it ariseth from love, somewhat that wee love and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, we are afraid of the losse of it, and this is the cause of feare. Now in regard of wealth, a man is afraid hee shall not have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; he shall not have a competencie; it is because hee loves the things of the world too much. A man is afraid of Death, why? because he loves his body too much. A man is afraid hee shall lose his children, or his friends, what is the reason? he loves them too much, too inordinatly. Wee should labour to love them only in, and for God, and then we shall not be afraid of the losse of them, but shall be content, to bee disposed in them, and in ourselves, as God shall see convenient in his heavenly wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>A word for the occasion, and that I will dispatch in a word.</p>
                  <p>You know the occasion of our meeting at this time, and in this place, it is to performe this last rite to the body of a Child that God hath taken lately to his mercie. You see how Almightie God is pleased to dispose it sometimes even oft-times from the Cradle to the Grave; out of the swadling-bands, to the winding-sheete: God will have it so sometimes: and when it is so, wee must lay our hands upon our mouthes, and bee content with the will of God.</p>
                  <p>For those that are Parents, let all learne this lesson, not to dote too much upon their children; not to be enamoured too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such flowers: you know how soone God takes them away, before you be aware. It is not their witt, or their comelinesse, or agilitie, and nimblenesse, or healthy constitution, or any thing that can award them from the stroake of death when God sends it: Therefore learne to love them, in, and for God, for his sake, and you shall have no cause to feare the losse of them, or grieve immoderately, when they are taken away; why? because they are all alive still to God; and this tender Babe is not lost, he is but sent before, he is alive still in the presence of God, the soule still lives, and the body shall live, and is in Gods account; Christ hath the charge of it, and will raise it at the last day. That man can lose no friend, that loves his friend, in, and for God: because they live with God, and he shall enjoy them at the last day.</p>
                  <p>Againe, as we may mourne for the losse of our friends and children (or else we were without naturall affection) so we must rejoyce that they have gained: as we have lost them, as they are taken from us; so they are taken from the evils of the world, from a great deale of sinne and miserie; and what that might have beene, the Lord only knowes; therefore wee have cause to bee thankfull.</p>
                  <p>And (beloved) be thankfull too, if God spare any: if hee take
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:14764:275"/>
one, he might have taken all, and prepare for it too: be thankfull for them that are left.</p>
                  <p>And remember, labour betimes to instruct your children in the feare of God: let it be the first thing we infuse into them, as soone as they be capable: namely, the elements of Christian Religion, holy, and heavenly things, why? because they may bee taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before we are aware. It may be wee have but a little time, but a few opportunities to doe good to them. I tell you what our conscience will tell us else, that wee have not beene so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to instruct our children, as they have beene capable. And this will cut sore, and lie heavie on our conscience: and therefore let us doe it betimes. Not only to prevent the Divell, and his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: but because you see how suddenly they may bee taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from us in a moment.</p>
                  <p>So Children should be admonished to learne <hi>to know the Lord God in the dayes of their youth:</hi> how soone that evill day may come we know not (that the wise man speakes of) therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times while yee haue opportunitie doe it.</p>
                  <p>And for our owne part, let us learne this;</p>
                  <p>First, when God croppes such flowers that rise in the budde; when he takes away such Children, be thankfull to God that hee hath given us a longer time, that he hath enlarged our dayes, and prolonged our yeares; that hee hath given us such a great deale of space, and opportunitie, to glorifie him here, to doe him ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the land of the living, to get evidence of our Calling and election, and to get assurance of our peace with him. Let us praise God for the length of our dayes, a blessing of God in it selfe, and a blessing to us if we improve it.</p>
                  <p>Againe, every one remember, if Children doe die, old men must die, any man may die. For if Death strike such as doe but begin to live, then we that have lived long, it is time and reason to expect death, and not to feare it.</p>
                  <p>I speake not this, as if we should be slavishly afraid of death: while we are so our lives are not comfortable. What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that we feare it inordinatly? because we love our lives, wee love our bodies, and the world inordinatly, and not in, and for God.</p>
                  <p>And then by the continuall spectacles of mortalitie, let us bee acquainted with death. A vizour, and apparition to a Child, <note place="margin">Simile.</note> scarres him, and he runnes from it at the first: but at last he growes throughly acquainted with it, and feares it not: so it is in regard of death, many men will not indure to heare of death, they will not indure to thinke of it, they will not indure to heare a <hi>Funerall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> or to come to <hi>the house of mourning,</hi> to be put in mind of their latter end: Death is a strange vizour to these men and women,
<pb facs="tcp:14764:276"/>
they are afraid of it, and runne from it: but if we did oft thinke of it, as oft as we thinke of sinne, in the cause of it. And when we feele sorrow, thinke, here is a harbinger of death. I feele paine in me, ere long I must surrender to the stroake of Death. And as oft as wee see spectacles of mortalitie, to reade a lecture of Death. And when we lay our selves downe in our beds thinke of Death. And upon all occasions come to <hi>the house of mourning,</hi> and thinke of Death. If the Serpents sting bee plucked out, a man may handle it, hee is shie at the first; but after, finding it cannot hurt him, he feares it not. So we have cause to thanke God for death, as well as for other things; thus farre; because hee hath changed the nature of it, and made it a sweet passage to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life. And then though God take Children, or friends, or goods, or any thing in this world, hee will be our <hi>exceeding great reward,</hi> hee will be <hi>All in all</hi> to us here, and hereafter.</p>

                  <p>He will bring their words and their actions to judgement: not onely their workes, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 10. God will bring every worke to judgement,</hi> and so <hi>Eccles. 12.

And the <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 36.</note> very rash and passionate speeches of men, what they speake in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and repent not of, even those passionate speeches that they thought might have easily beene passed by, <hi>He that cals his brother</hi>

                     <hi>of his angells in judgement against all those that have spoken against him.</hi> They have spoken against God, they have reviled him, he shall judge them for all their evill, and cursed speakings against him saith the Apostle. They in fury and madnesse fell to evill and cursed speaking and slighted God and despised him; therefore he shall come in great glory <hi>with thousands of his Angels,</hi> to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that he is more glorious then, they thought him to be, and he will now stand for the vindicating of his honour, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting of his glory in such a terrible appearance at that day. <hi>Against all those that speake evill,</hi> and against all their cursed spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings <hi>against him</hi> saith the Text, evill speaking against God, is cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed speaking. Because it exposeth a man to a curse, it leaves him under a curse that shall appeare at that day to bee just against him; so wee see God will bring both words and workes, to judgement at that day.</p>
                  <p>And the reasons are.</p>
                  <p>First, because the Law of God binds men in their speeches as <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. The Law binds men in speeches.</note> well as in their actions. I say the Law that shall judge them doth now binde them in their very speeches as well as in their actions. You have two commandements expresly taking notice of the words of men. The third commandement of the words of men cercerning God, <hi>he that takes the name of God in vaine, he will not hold him guiltlesse.</hi> And then the ninth commandement of the words of men concerning men, <hi>Thou shalt not beare false witnesse against thy neighbour.</hi> Now God that hath made a Law to bind, and to order men in the matter of speech, certainly he will judge men by that Law. You know that Kings and Princes, and Parliaments, and Kingdomes, they make not Lawes in vain, but they are the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherby the judges proceed in their course of judgement upon malefactours. So I say Gods Law it is not in vaine, it is not a bare direction onely to us in point of obedience, but also the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse rule whereby Christ himselfe will proceede in matter of judgement.</p>
                  <p>Againe secondly, there is great reason that words as well as actions should be brought to judgement, because God and men <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure God and man.</note> are injured by words as well as by actions.</p>
                  <p>First concerning God, you reade of some, <hi>Psal. 73. that set their mouthes against God, and against heaven.</hi> Indeede they can doe no more hurt to God then a man that shoots an Arrow at the Sunne can hurt the Sunne by shooting at him; but in their intention they set themselves against God in as much as their tongues are set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. And in <hi>Levit.</hi> 24. 11. The word there translated to <note place="margin">Levit. 24. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>blaspheme,</hi> it is in the originall, that the man stabbed God, or did pierce God, hee offered a kinde of violence to the holy name of God. Such sinfull speeches as are forbidden in the <hi>third Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,</hi>
                     <pb n="537" facs="tcp:14764:278"/>
and doe concerne the name of God or any of his attributes or ordinances, any thing that is spoken against them, or without due reverence and respect to them, they are there sayd to bee a stabbing of God, in the Hebrew phrase, or a piercing of God, a wounding of God, doing some violence to God himselfe. Now I say when such wrong and injury is done to God, shall not God take a time to right himselfe of those that injure him?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is an injury done to men. You know it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing in Law to have actions against men for speeches, they make speeches actions; they make them lyable to the penaltie and censure of the Law for speeches. So the Law of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds according to the very speeches of men, whereby they have discouraged his servants in any kind at any time, in any duty of Religion, and course of his worship, or whereby they have brought <hi>an ill report</hi> on it. As those <hi>spies</hi> did upon the Land, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they might not bee suffered to goe into the Land: So I say when men bring an evill report upon the duties of godlinesse they shut themselves out of the kingdome of God.</p>
                  <p>So likewise when men make that which is straight become crooked: It is sayd of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> that hee <hi>perverted the straight</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>wayes of God,</hi> that is, hee did as much as lay in him to make the straight wayes of God to seeme crooked, that as a man that puts a stick in the water though it bee straight when it is put in, yet it seemes crooked when it is in: So when a man puts colours and shewes upon good actions and courses, as if they were folly and indiscretion, and unadvised, and hypocrisie, and vaine, or whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is ill, this is to make the straight wayes of God crooked; to make that that God accounts straight to be crooked, this is a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against God: therefore <hi>Peter</hi> saith to <hi>Simon Magus, pray if it be possible that the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.</hi> So you see Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speakes to <hi>Elymas</hi> the sorcerer upon the same ground, <hi>Act. 13. Thou child of the divell and enemy to all righteousnesse, wilt thou not cease to pervent the right wayes of God?</hi> Now I say, here are the words and speeches that men speake against the wayes of God: these are speeches that argue men in a state, whereby they are lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and open to judgement, and exposed to wrath; therefore wee should take heed of such words.</p>
                  <p>The use may be to condemne those that make light account of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> To condemn those that make light account of words.</note> words; they thinke they may speake (it may bee) in rashnesse, and hastinesse and they may be excused for uttering them, it is their hastinesse, and their passion, and it was done unadvisedly, &amp;c. I but the Law of God is transgressed, the Majestie of God is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the anger of God is provoked. You know what old <hi>Eli</hi> sayd to his sonnes; <hi>My sonnes, if a man sinne against a man, man may plead for him, but if he offend against God, who shall plead for him?</hi>
                     <pb n="538" facs="tcp:14764:279"/>
I say, who shall take up the matter with God in such a case as this when the offence strikes against God, and his ordinances, and his worship? Therefore take heede there is much evill there <hi>is life and death</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith) <hi>in the power of the tongue,</hi> that is, a man may utterly destroy himselfe by the very words he speakes unadvised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as hee thinkes, and will plead for himselfe) or passionately and rashly.</p>
                  <p>Againe much more doth it concerne those that proceede to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinds of wickednesse in the tongue, we instanced in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular instances then, that we cannot now stand on.</p>
                  <p>We came to direct men to carry themselves in their speech, as <hi>David, to set a watch before the doore of their lippes,</hi> he prayed to God to doe it; And <hi>Psal. 39. I sayd that I will take heede to my wayes that I offend not in my tongue.</hi> And then he prayes to the Lord, <hi>Psal.</hi> 131. <note place="margin">Psal. 39. Psal. 131.</note> 
                     <hi>to keepe a watch before the doore of his mouth.</hi> Hee knew well enough that there will be a time, when the words that we thinke are sleight and vaine shall be brought to judgement, idle, unprofitable, frothy talke, much more rayling and reviling speeches, most of all the highest blasphemies and execrations, these shall most certainly be brought to a greater censure at the day of judgement. But I will not stand on that I then handled.</p>
                  <p>Now there remaines three things more.</p>
                  <p>The first is this that in the day of judgement God will proceed according to his Law: So speake and so doe as those that shall bee judged by the Law.</p>
                  <p>I say,</p>
                  <p>In the day of judgement God will proceede with men according <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doctr.</hi> God will proceede in judgement according to his Law.</note> to his Law.</p>
                  <p>Hee will proceede according to his word written: therefore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that your speeches and actions may bee such that they may be agreeable to that, <hi>Iohn 12. 48. The word that I speake to you</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>shall judge you at that day.</hi> There is not a word that Christ <note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 48.</note> speakes, but it shall judge: he speakes not in vaine, he is the judge that speakes. Now you know Christ speakes two wayes. Eyther in himselfe, Or, by his Ministers.</p>
                  <p>In himselfe, and so eyther that that hee spake when hee was on earth in his his owne person; then all the words that hee spake at that time are those words by which he will judge men, as farre as they concerne morrall actions, by those words he will judge men at the great day: for he spake nothing but what was according to his Law.</p>
                  <p>Or else that which he spake in his Apostles immediatly, by a
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:14764:279"/>
certaine and infallible worke of the Spirit, directing them to such truth as that they could not erre in speaking: now in this Christ still spake in them. The same way Christ hath in speaking to this day: therefore saith he, <hi>he that heareth you heareth me, and he that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth me heareth him that sent me.</hi> That which he spake to them, hee spake in them concerning all the Ministers of the Gospel. What we speake as Ministers, that is, as men that looke to the direction of our Lord; for we are but Embassadours, and our words are so far of value and power as they are the speeches of our Lord; and as we speake the word of him whose Embassadours we are. Now I say looke what the Minister thus speakes as the Embassadour of Christ to the people, that Christ will confirme at the day of judgement. Now it will appeare what wee speake as Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, if we speake nothing but what is agreeable to the text of Scripture rightly understood. Therefore marke it, whatsoever sinne wee denounce the judgement of God against, and urge Scripture for it, it is the very rule that Christ will observe in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men. Or else that speech could not stand, <hi>what yee loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven, and what yee bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.</hi> Wee bind, when by declaring of mens sinnes, wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the judgement of God against such sinnes, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce men to stand under the wrath of God that remaine in those sinnes: saith Christ what you thus binde on earth <hi>shall bee bound in heaven,</hi> that is, Gods act shall ratifie and confirme the same sentence in heaven which we denounce here upon earth by vertue of this word.</p>
                  <p>So when wee come to distressed soules, and declare to them that they stand acquitted, and that by the Word of God; and so as Ministers of the Gospell by vertue of the truth revealed to us, declare that they are freed from the bond and guilt of their sinnes, upon those evidences of repentance that they manifest: I say, it is ratified in heaven. Therefore you see there is no other way of proceeding, but looke as Christs owne words when hee was upon the earth, so the same that are as his owne words, that is, those truths that are drawne from Christs truths have the same power upon the hearts and consciences of men now to command them and shall have after to judge them, as ever they had.</p>
                  <p>But here it may be objected: it should seeme that all men shall <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> not be judged by the Law, because there are some men to whom the Law hath never beene published: for what shall wee say to a great part of the world, that have not yet received the Scriptures: we know that the Scriptures have not beene published to a great part of the world: at this day there are many Heathens, many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, that never had the Scriptures; therefore how shall they be judged by the Law? except you say, that onely those shall bee
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:14764:280"/>
judged by it, that have beene under the preaching of the Gospell, and have had the helpe of the Scriptures?</p>
                  <p>We answer, that all mankinde, and every particular man is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> All men jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Law. The Law not alike ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed to all.</note> the Law, onely the Law is not alike expressed to them, it is not revealed alike to all sorts. All have the Law, and the Law written too: but eyther it is written in the hearts of men, and so it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the hearts of all the Sonnes of men. Or else in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and so it is more clearely and evidently manifested in the Churches, but yet neverthelesse in the hearts of men is the Law written, as much as shall be sufficient to condemne them, as we see, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. saith the Apostle, <hi>If the Gentiles which have not the Law, doe by nature the things conteined in the Law, they having not the Law</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 14:</note> 
                     <hi>are a Law to themselves, and shew the effect of the Law written in their hearts their consciences accusing, or excusing them before God. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that had not the Law,</hi> that is, not the Law written in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; yet neverthelesse <hi>they are a Law to themselves;</hi> that is, they have certaine principles, certaine rules which remaine in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall consciences, whereby they eyther <hi>accuse or excuse,</hi> as they doe good or evill. And even these doe shew that they have a Law that doth binde them, and shall condemne them; because that when they would not obey even that Law, that is, even those prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples whereupon their consciences wrought to accuse or excuse they were sinners against the Law. So that wee see no man shall be condemned at the day of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>udgement but by vertue of the Law: and however all have not the Scripture, yet they have a naturall conscience, and the Law written there whereby it accuseth, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth. Howsoever it bee true that things are not alike expresly manifested to other people and to us that have the Scriptures, yet they have so much manifested to them as shall condemne them.</p>
                  <p>And the reasons of it are these why it must be so.</p>
                  <p>First, because the Law of God is Gods Scepter, whereby hee <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. The Law is Gods scepter that he rules by. Psal. 110. 2.</note> governes and rules the Church, <hi>Psal. 110. 2. he shall bring the rod of thy power out of Sion. The rod of thy power,</hi> that is, the Scepter of thy power: that Scepter whereby thou dost authoritatively and by power rule over the Churches: and what is this Scepter? It is the word, as we shall see, <hi>Esay 2, 3, 4. The Law shall come out of Sion.</hi> So then the Scepter, the rod of the word that is brought out of <hi>Sion</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isay 2. 3. 4.</note> is the Law that comes out of <hi>Sion,</hi> the word of God, the Law of workes and the Law of faith; for both these come out of <hi>Sion:</hi> the Law of workes as farre as it is the rule of life; and then the Law of Faith, both come in to rule the Church of God. Yea, this is the rod of Christs power, therefore hee will manifest his power, and make all men subject to it. What power? There is a power of Christ, such a power whereby he manifests his owne
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:14764:280"/>
greatnesse and soveraigntie over all his creatures; over those crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that have not sence, that have not reason; that is not this Law. But this power here, the Scepter of his power is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he manifests his soveraigntie, over reasonable creatures, Angels and men,: therefore if they will not obey him, yet it shall bee a <hi>Scepter of Iron</hi> to crush them in peeces. Therefore we see the very Angels themselves that would not obey the directing comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, the rule of life, in that particular place wherein they were; they found it a Scepter to crush them downe; and they were cast out of their place for their sinne. So likewise men; you see what the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> speakes of those that perished in the time of <hi>Noah,</hi> because they would not receive the Word preached to them, but they would be lawlesse and disobedient, or like men that would be under no Law, therefore they felt the force of it in the effect of the Law, in the fruite and penaltie of the Law upon them. So I say Christ still rules by power in the Law; in so much as that when the Law and command prevailes not, then the punishment prevailes; and they that will not subject themselves to the Law, they shall bee subdued under the punishment of the Law: that is the first thing.</p>
                  <p>Againe secondly, it must bee that Christ must proceede in <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because the law is a rule.</note> judgement according to the Law; because the Law is the rule. Now you know a rule is a note of distinction, it is that that being streight and right in it selfe, which doth distinguish and discover things that are crooked. So the Law of Christ, it is a straight rule in it selfe: therefore whatsoever is contrary to it, is crooked and perverse. And he will declare a righteous proceeding contrary to the unrighteousnesse of men. How? by that rule that disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers unrighteousnesse. How shall Christ appeare to be righteous in his Law, except he have a rule whereby unrighteousnesse shall be discovered? Now that is discovered by the Law, the right rule, as it is, <hi>Psal. 19. The statutes of the Lord are right.</hi> Now <hi>rectum</hi> is <hi>index sua oblique,</hi> that that not onely declares its owne excellencie, but the unrighteousnesse, and obliquitie of the contrary; therefore Christ shall proceede by the Law, because that shall most cleare his proceedings. For all the world will grant that that is a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous rule; Therefore <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 8. when the Prophet would deale <note place="margin">Mica. 6. 8.</note> with men that were unrighteous, that would walke wilfully, and rebelliously against God, and then serve him with outward perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, <hi>wherewith shall I come before the Lord? and bow before the high God? he hath shewed thee O man what is good,</hi> that is, <hi>to doe justly, and to walke humbly with thy God.</hi> So that now, looke what rule it is that shewes what is good, that is the rule whereby the righteous Judge will proceede in judgement: Now the Law shewes what is good, he hath shewed in his Law what is good: therefore hee gives a
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:14764:281"/>
briefe summe of the Law there, <hi>to walke humbly with God,</hi> that is the substance of the first Table of the Law: and <hi>to doe justice</hi> that is the substance of the second Table of the Law; therefore saith hee, <hi>he hath shewed thee what is good,</hi> this is a righteous rule, that discernes betweene good and evill. Looke what that is that in the directions of life discernes betweene good and evill, that also in the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Judge will cleare his justice, eyther in rewarding the good, or in punishing the evill: therefore Christ must needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede according to his owne Law in judgement. Thus the point is opened.</p>
                  <p>Now a word or two for application. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>oofe of those that neglect the Law.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it so that Christ will proceede in judgement by his owne Law: then it serves in the first place for the just reproofe of those that neglect the Law, that neglect this direction that Christ gives them. Alas is it a small matter thus to slight the Law of God? the Word of God? why, you shall bee judged by this: <hi>God shall judge the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of all men</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>in that day according <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>o my Gospell,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16. not onely that looke what he hath spoken of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall proove true; but that in the judgement there shall be a proceeding proportionable and agreeable to what hee hath spoken in that word that he calls his Gospell. Therefore take heede how you slight this Word, it is a dangerous thing. Saith <hi>Solomon, Pro. 13. 13. he that despiseth the Commandement shall perish.</hi> Hee that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth the Commandement, when God hath revealed his will in <note place="margin">Prov. 13. 13.</note> matter of dutie, for the direction of life (for that he calls the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement there) now if a man come to despise this, he shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely perish saith <hi>Solomon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When doth a man despise the Commandement? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>You know to despise is when a man accounts a thing of no <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> To despise Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement what.</note> force; that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>despise not prophesying.</hi> The word is, account it not a thing of nothing, account it not a slight matter.</p>
                  <p>Now you know a man accounts a thing as a thing of nothing when he undervalues it, when he gives it lesse acknowledgment then it is worthy of. As if a man come to buy a Jewell or a Pearle in the Market, and offer a sleight and small matter for it, hee had as good bid nothing, the undervaluing of a commoditie, is as the accounting of it worth nothing. In spirituall things when a man accounts the Law of God below it selfe, that is, when hee makes it not the chiefe direction of his life, then hee accounts it as a thing of nothing, and despiseth the Law.</p>
                  <p>For either the Law is somewhat by Gods appointment, or not at all; if it be somewhat by Gods appointment, then it must have that place that God hath appointed it, or else wee give it not any esteeme according to the appointment of God, but according to our owne Fancy. I say if wee give the Law esteeme according to
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:14764:281"/>
Gods appointment, and by vertue of his Word, then wee will give it the esteeme that God hath put upon it, that is, that it shall rule us in all our actions; and that it shall be our supreame rule and guide, that a man shall account nothing else as the sufficient direction of his life but the Law. Now when men come to this, that they will preferre their owne opinions before the Law; when they will preferre the opinion of other men before the Text of Scripture: when they preferre the customes of the world, before the rule of the Word. This is now to dispise the Law, to make it as a thing of nothing. As you see it plaine, it is ordinary in Scripture thus to tax men; as when they would account the traditions of men above the word; <hi>In vaine they worship me,</hi> saith God, they become vanitie themselves for accounting the Law vaine. So when they preferred the customes of their forefathers equall with the Law, they despised the Law: this mixture, this joyning of other things with it, it is that that the Scripture calls <hi>the despising of the Law.</hi> Therefore it is a dangerous thing to despise the Law. Is it not dangerous to despise the Judge? the Law shall bee your Judge; that is, the rule whereby the Judge shall proceede.</p>
                  <p>You know it is the aggravation of the fault of a Malefactor, that he not onely transgresseth and sinneth against the Lawes of the Kingdome, but that he hath despised the Law: if hee have beene heard to speake any speeches to the contempt of the Law, this is a great aggravation of his sinne: how much more shall it bee in the day of the Lord? Mens Lawes are imperfect, and therefore are revoked many times, and repealed, and reversed, but this Law of God is a perfect Law, and therefore it shall never bee reversed, it shall never be revoked nor altred. Now for a man to sleight and neglect this in any point or degree it is a high contempt against God himselfe. That as a man might say of the Iewes; when Christ came amongst them, hee offered himselfe to bee their King; but being they would not take him for their King who (if they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him so) would have beene their Saviour; therefore the time shall come that he will be their Judge and not their Saviour. So I say concerning the Law, the Law now published in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word; those that will not now take it to be their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor shall finde it then to bee their condemner. If this be a harsh saying as they speake of the command of Christ, <hi>Ioh. 6. This is a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>hard saying, who can beare it?</hi> If the Commandement of Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning obedience seeme harsh, then how harsh a saying shall that be, <hi>depart yee cursed into everlasting fire?</hi> If it bee so hard a thing <note place="margin">Matth. 25. 41</note> to stand to the command of the Law, how hard a thing will it bee to stand under the penaltie and censure of the Law? Therefore I say, let men take heede, they shall finde that even that very faith commanded that they have sleighted, it shall proove heavie:
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:14764:282"/>
they sleighted it in obedience, it shall proove heavie in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and punishment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it may serve for admonition, and so to teach us how <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Admonition to observe the Law:</note> to carry our selves. If the Law of God be the rule whereby hee will judge us. First then looke to the law for direction, looke to the precept, to the command of God for the directing of our lives. <note place="margin">1. For direction.</note> I know not how, but I am sure, by the malice of Sathan it is come into the world, into the Church, that some men (upon pretence of giving the doctrine of justification by grace, and by the merits of Christ the full vertue of it) would put men off from all obedience, as if therefore wee were not to be under the direction of the Law, because wee are freed from the Law by Christ. They distinguish not betweene the penaltie of the Law, and the command of the Law: the same Christ that hath freed us from the punishment of the Law (as many as are in him by faith) hath subjected us to the command of the Law, and that in his owne person; and not onely so but in his owne precept. Therefore he became an expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Law, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. and shewes that <hi>the Law is spirituall,</hi> that it <note place="margin">Matth. 5:</note> is a thing that binds the conscience, and would have all men looke to the direction of the Law. And the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> then whom no man ever spake more fully of justification by Faith, yet the same Apostle would not have the Law as it is a direction of life abolished; but would have men so much the more new, as by new arguments and incouragements they are set upon the duties of obedience.</p>
                  <p>But I say, such is the malice of Sathan as to draw men upon such grounds as these are (not rightly understood by them) to I know not what course of liberti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>sme; and though they pretend a course of obedience to the Law, yet they will not doe it as to the Law. Whereas it is evident that the Law is appointed as a curbe to our corruption to cure and purge out that. And therefore it is formen to be wiser then God, to ground their actions upon another prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and ground, then God grounds them.</p>
                  <p>Indeede the servants of God doe not the actions of obedience simply because of the Law written in the Scriptures, but <hi>they have the Law written in their hearts too,</hi> so the Spirit of God is a Spirit that guides them according to the Law, and disposeth them to those actions that are sutable to the Law: yet he never excludes, or puts them from the Law, from subjection to the Law in point of obedience. I say therefore errours creepe in amongst men to dreame of a libertie from obedience, when the Scripture speaks of a libertie from the Law but in other sences, not in matter of dutie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let men looke to the Law for tryall too, <hi>Gal. 6. 3, 4. If a man thinke he is something when he is nothing, he deceiveth him</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. For tryall. Gal. 6. 3. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>selfe:</hi> but <hi>let every man try himselfe, and prove his owne worke.</hi> Let him

proove his owne worke: by what shall he prove it? Why, by the Law. By the Law here we meane the whole Word of God, the Law of workes and of Faith. I say let him proove his workes by this Law, by the written Word of God. Therefore if a man would now know how it shall goe with him at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let him begin to judge himselfe by this rule before hand. Let him reason thus, eyther I shall stand as condemned, or acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: if as condemned it is by the Law, therefore (marke) so farre as I goe on in any sinne against any knowne truth of God, so farre I stand in the estate of a condemned person.</p>
                  <p>Therefore consider beloved, you doe exceedingly wrong your selves, because you doe not looke thus upon your actions; you looke not upon them as upon things that are transgressions against the Law that shall judge you: and that therefore if the Law of God condemne such actions now, then thou standest as a condemned person by vertue of that Law.</p>
                  <p>Alas, durst men goe on without repentance in any course of sinne, if they tooke themselves as condemned men (in truth) by vertue of the Law? There is not any word that thou speakest, but as soone as it is spoken, thou standest in the estate of a condemned man, and if thou interest not thy selfe in Christ, and come not in, certainly the Law will passe upon it. Therefore seriously consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this, that there is no evill or particular sinne that you goe on in, but if the Law condemne it, Christ will condemne it too at the day of judgement. Therefore you must before hand condemne your selves <hi>that you may not be condemned of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 32. <hi>Iudge your selves, and you shall not be judged of the Lord.</hi> But yet this <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 32.</note> remaynes a truth still, that hee that doth not condemne himselfe, that doth not take off his sinnes by unfeigned repentance, he stands a condemned person before the Lord, because he stands condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Law.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I beseech you beloved pleade not any priviledge in Christ; I speake this the rather because men use the Gospell to their owne destruction, I say plead not priviledge by Christ) if you goe on in the allowance of any sinne; <hi>Shall we continue in sinne that grace may abound? God forbid</hi> saith the Apostle. So I say when a man will come and plead, I believe, and I hope to be saved by Faith, yet neverthelesse it may be thou art a swearer, a vaine spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of thy time, it may be thou art a neglecter of the duties of the worship of God, and of thy duties towards men, &amp;c. thou art a man in some constant course, in some way of sinne or other: I say this shewes thee to stand as a condemned man, and in the state of a condemned man. I say not that such a man shall infallibly bee damned, because <hi>God may give him repentance that hee may come out of the snare of the divell;</hi> but wee say hee stands for the present in the
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:14764:283"/>
state of a condemned person, and he is condemned by the Law, and remaynes so till this be reversed by repentance, till hee have sued out his pardon by interresting himselfe in Christ.</p>
                  <p>Therefore consider this seriously, that there is not that sinne in thought that thou committest, not any act of sinne whatsoever; but because of that sinne thou art condemned in Law, therefore thou standest in the state of a condemned person for that sinne: therefore there must bee somewhat done now to take off this. I say a man may have a pardon, and yet if he sue it not out it is of no force, or use to him; so letno man talke hee is a justified person by Christ, but thou must sue out this pardon. Therefore wee are taught upon daily suing to renew our daily prayers for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sinne. There must be a daily suing out of the pardon, and that upon this ground: so there must be a daily condemning of thy selfe, and of sinne in thy selfe. Alas what shall become of a world of men and women? (I speake not of those that are without; wee leave them, they are condemned in the sight of all the world, but) wee speake of those that are now in the Church; of those that goe some what forward in the profession of Religion, and hope and are perswaded that they are in a good case, and yet have little care to set things right betweene God and themselves; but though such and such actions be condemned by the Law, yet they hope that there is a generall mercy that will pardon it, though they never sue out their pardon. I say the Law shall passe on thee till thou doe that that concernes thee to be released from the rigour and sentence of the Law, <hi>he that confesseth and forsakes his sinnes shall</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 28. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>finde mercy, Prov.</hi> 28. 13. This must be done, and so in other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; the Scripture is large in these things, that somewhat must be done by us to sue out this pardon: that though there be an act of pardon in God, a free act, yet there must somewhat bee done by us to sue out this pardon for our selves, or else wee stand in the state of condemned persons.</p>
                  <p>But these things I leave to your meditations, and so I fall upon the next point, which I will briefly touch, and that is no more but thus: that since there shall be a proceeding in the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Law, wherein mens actions and words shall bee brought to account therefore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The consideration of the day of judgement should be an effectuall insentive</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> The conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should moove to holinesse.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp; provocation to stinmen to a holy, and conscionable walking in this life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So speake and so doe, as those that shall be judged by such a Law.</hi> Since the Apostle makes this use of it to direct us both in our speeches, and actions, I say we may learne hence, that the consideration of the judgement to come, wherein Christ will proceede according to the Law, it should be an effectuall meanes to make us carefull of holinesse and new obedience, <hi>so to speake and so to doe</hi> as those
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:14764:283"/>
whose words and actions must be brought to judgement. Now that this is so, and is intended so, and hath prevailed with the servants of God, I might prove many wayes. I will ranke and order the proofe under these heads.</p>
                  <p>First, I will shew you how this hath beene a meanes to draw some, to the wayes, and duties of obedience.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, how it hath beene the way to direct, and guide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in those actions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, how it hath confirmed and strengthened them in those actions: and by this we shall see what it should be to us.</p>
                  <p>First, we shall see how it hath beene a way to draw men to the actions of obedience. How are men drawne to bee obedient? <note place="margin">1. It hath drawn some to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> First, they are drawne from their owne sinnes, from their owne evill wayes. Now the consideration of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, it hath prevailed, and beene used for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to draw men from their sinnes. As wee see in <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. saith <hi>Solomon</hi> to the young man; <hi>Rejoyce now in thy youth;</hi> it is Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically <note place="margin">Eccles. 11. 9.</note> spoken, <hi>but know,</hi> saith hee, <hi>that for these things thou shalt come to judgement.</hi> That is, let this coole thy courage, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate thy excessive joy, know that thou shalt come to judgement. <hi>Act. 17. 30. Now</hi> (saith he) <hi>God calls upon all men, every where to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: because hee hath appointed a time in which hee will judge the world.</hi> Hee calls men to repentance by this argument, because hee will judge the world, and hath appointed a time for it. You know re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance it is nothing else but to forsake our former evills: Now he calls them to repentance, because he will judge the world, and so calls as he drawes men from sinne.</p>
                  <p>First, he drawes men from the world to God by this. You know that even worldly affections hinder men from comming to <note place="margin">1. To forsake the world.</note> the obedience of Christ: <hi>therefore,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>I account all as dung,</hi> &amp;c <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 7. Why? because he looked for a Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 7.</note> his thoughts were upon that: and saith hee verse 20. <hi>our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation is in heaven, from whence wee looke for the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Therefore we are drawne to this holy course of obedience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we looke for Christ from heaven.</p>
                  <p>And then againe in the disposing of men to new obedience: there is not only a forsaking of sinne, and the world, but besides <note place="margin">2. Disposing the heart to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> that, there is an inward qualifying of the heart: Now the heart is qualified; that is, it is fitted by certaine qualities to the service of God, by the helpe of this consideration, as wee see <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 10. <note place="margin">Eccles: 12. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Tou see the summe of all, feare God, and keepe his Commandements: for God will bring every worke to judgement:</hi> Upon this ground hee mindes them to <hi>feare God,</hi> which is that qualitie that disposeth a man to keepe his Commandements; hee perswades them upon this ground: <hi>because God will bring every worke to judgement. Let us
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:14764:284"/>
have grace in our hearts to serve the Lord with reverence and feare, Heb.</hi> 12. I say, this qualifies and disposeth us to the service of God; <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> and we are fitted to seeke, and to serve God with due reverence and feare, by the consideration of the judgement to come, that he is a <hi>God</hi> that <hi>will judge the world.</hi> So in <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. hee would have <note place="margin">Rev. 14.</note> the Nations to feare God, <hi>because hee will come to judge the world.</hi> So much for the first thing: you see the consideration of the judgement to come, prepares men to holinesse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, besides that, it quickens them to all the actions of <note place="margin">2. It quickens to actions of obedience.</note> obedience, when they are in it: when now a man is in a good course, and his heart is prepared to seeke God aright, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse there are many temptations, and many corruptions, that sometimes indispose, and unfit his heart againe: Now then the consideration of the judgement to come, it serves to revive and quicken the heart to these actions, to <note place="margin">1. Os particular calling.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Those of a mans particular Calling.</p>
                  <p>Those of his generall Calling.</p>
                  <p>For his particular calling, the Apostle exhorts <hi>Timothie,</hi> and chargeth him, before God and Christ, <hi>that shall judge the quicke and the dead,</hi> to be faithfull in his ministerie; Hee would have him faithfull in his ministerie upon this ground, because Christ will <hi>come with his elect Angells, to judge the quicke, and the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And so for our generall Calling, <hi>Act. 24. I desire to keepe a good conscience before God and men</hi> upon this ground; because I beleeve <note place="margin">2. Generall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> the Resurrection, and so a judgement to come. So in 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 11. Seeing all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought wee to be in all holy conversation and godlinesse?</hi> Why? all these things shall be dissolved, therefore we had need to bee other manner of persons then we are, to be better kinde of persons then we have beene. Thus, I say, the servants of God quicken themselves to more holinesse, upon consideration of the judgement to come.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they have beene confirmed, and strengthened upon <note place="margin">3. It confirmes in obedience:</note> this ground: for when the heart of man is brought to this plight, that he must be ever chearefull, and lively, and active in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God: yet there are many discouragements, and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to draw him out of the way againe; that it may be hee may fall, if he have not somewhat to support him, and hold him up: therefore the consideration of the judgement to come, it hath kept the hearts of Gods servants in a good frame, when they have beene in it. Saith the Apostle, <hi>be constant, and immoveable, alwayes abounding in the worke os the Lord, for as much as yee know that your labour is not in vaine in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. As if hee had said, You know this, that there will a time come when it will appeare that you serve not God in vaine, therefore for the present bee constant in the good you are in: <hi>Hold fast that thou hast till I come,</hi> saith
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:14764:284"/>
Christ to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia, and let no man take thy crowne, Rev.</hi> 3. 21. Christ will come, and it is but holding fast a-while, and <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 11.</note> then the Church shall have a crowne; and the servants of God shall have a crowne of glory, an abundant recompence of all that they have done in the service of God, therefore <hi>hold fast.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. the Apostle exhorts to patience, because they <note place="margin">Iam. 5.</note> should meet with many persecutions, and oppositions, <hi>bee patient, for the comming of the Lord drawes neere.</hi> Beare the injuries that you suffer for the present, and the indignities, and the unkind usage of men, for the comming of the Lord drawes neere, when you shall have a plentifull harvest: so he goes on illustrating this by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison taken from a Husband-man that waits for a harvest, and then he shall have a plentifull croppe, and increase for all his paines in Winter, and in seed time: so saith he, the Lord will come, and then you shall have a plentifull increase.</p>
                  <p>A word or two for the Use of this:</p>
                  <p>Since this is the Use that the servants of God have made, and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> Shewing the cause of the worlds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse, and the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectednesse.</note> that wee should make of the Judgement to come, therefore to bee more carefull in the duties of obedience, and holinesse, <hi>so to speake, and so to doe, as those that shall be judged.</hi> It first shewes the cause of the discouragements of Gods servants, and the prophanenesse of the world is, because they perfectly beleeve not the judgement to come. The hearts of Gods servants would not droupe so, they would not be so faint, so dejected, and discouraged, if they beleeved that there were such a judgement to come, wherein Christ will abundantly recompence all their sorrowes, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, wherein he will bring his reward with him plentifully.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the wicked world would not be so prophane as they are: drunkards, and swearers, and Sabbath-breakers, and all sorts of wicked persons, they would not give themselves so to sinne as they doe, if in truth, they did perfectly beleeve there were a judgement to come; when all their words, and actions, their company, their time, and every thing shall be brought to account. I say, the cause of all prophanenesse is this, here it begins; men beleeve not the judgement to come. The Apostles were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with these kind of scoffers; <hi>Where is the promise of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming?</hi> So they hardened themselves upon the observation of the continuance of the seasons upon the face of the earth in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from the beginning. Well, saith the Apostle; <hi>God is not slacke,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>as men count slacknesse, but is patient, and forbearing, that men may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;</hi> but at the last he will come, and <hi>come with flaming fire.</hi> So, this is certaine, whatsoever you thinke, and <hi>put the evill day farre off from you,</hi> yet there is a judgement comming, wherein all your actions, and affections, and speeches, and your whole conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall be scanned, and brought to the rules of this law that you have despised.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="550" facs="tcp:14764:285"/>
Therefore let men take heed, and know it is a device of Satan to harden their hearts; either to thinke that the law is a dead let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I meane in respect of the directing use of it, that it is of no use to direct them; it is a devise of Satan to put them off: for they shall find that that law will judge them, that now should direct them. And then againe for men to thinke that there shall bee no Judgement, or not such proceedings according to the law: this is a tricke of the Divell, to keepe men in prophanenesse, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart.</p>
                  <p>Therefore secondly, if wee would <hi>grow up in holinesse in the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. To streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then faith of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
                     <hi>feare of God:</hi> Let us perfect, and strengthen our faith in assenting to this truth, that there is such a judgement to come, wherein our words, and actions, and all shall be brought to account. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>so speake, and so doe, as those that shall bee judged.</hi> Thou art now in companie, and thou speakest amongst men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but thy words are with God, <hi>they are written</hi> in thy conscience, as it is in <hi>Ieremie, upon the Table of thy heart,</hi> there they are written: the words that thou hast forgotten seven yeares agoe, it may bee twentie yeares agoe, and never tookest a course to get them blotted out by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, there they are written, and these words shall be brought to judgement, and so many actions as thou hast neglected, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looke to it.</p>
                  <p>First bewaile those words and actions past, as things that else will come to judgement, if thou judge not thy selfe before-hand.</p>
                  <p>And then againe for the time to come, set on a resolution to walke daily, as one that may die every day, and then shall bee brought to judgement. Therefore judge thy selfe daily, renew thy Covenant, settle thy peace on a right ground daily, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holinesse in the feare of God daily, as one that expectest a Judgement. Saint <hi>Iude</hi> condemnes those that <hi>feasted without feare.</hi> They were at their Tables, companying, and feasting, as men without feare. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> speakes of himselfe, that whatsoever he <note place="margin">Ierome.</note> was doing, he had a fearefull apprehension of the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Alwayes, saith he, whether I eate or drinke, or whatsoever I doe, I heare the Trumpet, and the voyce of the Arch-Angell saying, <hi>Arise yee dead, and come to judgement.</hi> Well, I say, doe thou so, let this be thy serious thought, and doe it not slightly; but thinke that this may bee thy last word, and thou must bee brought to judgement for it: this may be thy last opportunie, and thy last action, and thou must be brought to judgement for that. Doe things in this manner, <hi>as those that so speake, and so doe, that they must bee judged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wouldest thou be content to have thy oathes brought before Christ in judgement? if not, take heed of swearing: for it is judged already by the law: therefore judge, and condemne thy
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:14764:285"/>
sinnes in thy selfe, and forsake them, that thou maist find mercie. Wouldest thou be found guiltie of Sabbath-breaking at the day of Judgement? if not repent of thy former guilt, and bee more conscionable of sanctifying the Sabbath after. And so I may say of every sinne. Wouldest thou be found an Usurer? a Deceiver? unrighteous in any course? a scoffer? a prophane person? Woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou appeare before Christ so in judgement? If not, repent of thy guilt in this kind, <hi>that thy sinnes may bee done away, when the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of Christ.</hi> And in the meane time set thy selfe in a contrarie course to that thou hast beene: doe as one that would have Death find thee in a good course: for <hi>as death leaves thee, judgement shall find thee.</hi> If Death find thee in a state of repentance, in a course of reformation of thy evill wayes, judgement shall find thee so too. Let Death therefore find thee as a man interest in Christ, as a man humbling thy soule, abhorring thy selfe for thy former sinnes: let Death find thee as a man reforming all those evills that are condemned in the Word, and in thy conscience. Now when I say, let Death find thee so, I meane, set about it presently: for how soone Death may set upon thee thou knowest not, whether to night or no: and if this be not now done, if thou set not about it now, it may bee too late, thou shalt have no more time, therefore doe that now, and goe on constantly after, knowing that Death may find thee every moment. Therefore it is that God keepes from us (upon purpose, as it were) the certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the time of Death, that wee may bee alwayes prepared for Death.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He latter part of this Chapter from the 12. Verse to the end, is spent in a grave and powerfull dehortation of the faithfull, from securitie in sinne: against which the Apostle useth sundry arguments. That which he presseth most is drawne from the severall ends to which sinne and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse doth leade men: The end <hi>of sinne is death;</hi> vers. 21. therefore that is not to bee served: The end of <hi>of righteousnesse is life everlasting,</hi> vers. 22. therefore that is to be imbraced. Because there is now difference in the manner of the proceeding of these two ends, death comming from sinne as from the meritorious cause, but life from righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, another manner of way, therefore the Apostle addes this epiloge and conclusion in the last verse, plainely shewing, and more clearely expressing the manner of them both: <hi>for the wages</hi> (saith hee) <hi>of sinne is death, but the gift of God is eternall life through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi>

In which words we have a description of a twofold service. <note place="margin">Parts of the Text.</note>
Of <hi>sinne</hi> in the former clause. And of God, or <hi>righteousnesse</hi> in the latter.</p>
                  <p>And how both these are rewarded.</p>
                  <p>The one with <hi>death;</hi> it payes us well.</p>
                  <p>And the other with <hi>life,</hi> which is bestowed by the free <hi>gift of God through Christ.</hi> These are the two parts, the two generall points that we are to consider.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>the wages of sinne is death,</hi> saith the Apostle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[Of sinne]</hi> That is, of the depravation, and corruption of our nature, and so consequently of every sinne, that being not onely it selfe sinne, but the matter, and mother of all sinne, <hi>when sinne hath conceived it bringeth forth death,</hi> when sinne is put forth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he signifieth the generall depravation and corruption of our nature, from whence all sinne flowes. So it is here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[The wages]</hi> The word in the originall signifieth properly victualls, because victualls was that that the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours <note place="margin">Meaning of the words.</note> gave their souldiers as <hi>wages,</hi> in recompence of their service: but thence the word extends to signifie any other wages or <hi>Salary</hi> whatsoever. <hi>The wages of sinne [is death]</hi> by death here is signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and meant, both temporall and eternall death, especially eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death; for it is opposed to eternall life in the next clause of the sentence, therefore that is that that is principally meant, <hi>The wages of sinne is death,</hi> that is eternall death. This for the expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the tearmes.</p>
                  <p>The point to bee observed from this first part of the Text is this, that</p>
                  <p>Death is as due to sinne, as wages to one that earnes it.</p>
                  <p>To such a one wages is due in strict justice, if a man have a hyred <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Death due to sinne as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> servant, he may bestow a free gift on him if he will, if he will not he may choose; but his stypend or his <hi>wages</hi> he must pay him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he will be unjust, for it is the price of his worke, and so is due to him that he cannot without injustice withhold it. After such a manner is death due to sinne: the very demerrite of the worke of sinne requires it, as being earned. God is as just in inflicting death upon sinners for their sinnes, as any man is in paying his labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer or hired servant their <hi>wages:</hi> for this is the generall plaine scope of the Apostles words here.</p>
                  <p>So in the beginning God appointed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. where hee told <hi>Adam</hi> concerning the forbidden fruite <hi>in the day that thou eatest</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>thereof thou shalt die the death.</hi> As if hee should have sayd, when thou sinnest, death must be thy <hi>wages.</hi> The same is repeated, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 20. where it is sayd, <hi>The soule that sinneth shall die,</hi> expressing the <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>wages</hi> of sinne, it is death, that is the recompence of sinne: if sinne
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:14764:288"/>
have his due then death must follow. So the Apostle had shewed before in this Epistle, <hi>Rom. 5. 12. that by one man sinne entred into the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>world, and death by sinne, so death went over all men, for as much as all men had sinned.</hi> All had sinned, therefore all are payed with death. And Saint <hi>Iames</hi> shewes the consequence and connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene these two, the worke and the <hi>wages,</hi> he tells us, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 15, <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 15.</note> that <hi>when sinne hath conceived it bringeth forth death.</hi> All these places are evidences that death by Gods ordinance, by his appointment is the due of sinne, as due to it, even as <hi>wages</hi> is to a hyred servant or one that hath earned it.</p>
                  <p>What death is it that is due to sinne? <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quest. Answ.</hi> Wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>Both temporall and eternall death. I say both deaths; concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning both which the truth is to be cleared from some doubts. It was the Pelagians errour to thinke that man should have dyed a <note place="margin">1. Temporall.</note> naturall death, though he had never sinned: so they thought that the naturall, temporall, bodily death, was not the wages of sinne. Contrary to the Apostle in the plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> I spake of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. where hee <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> makes that death that goes over all men, (which must needes bee naturall death) to enter by sinne, <hi>sinne brought in death;</hi> no sinne, no death at all.</p>
                  <p>But it may be objected, when God told <hi>Adam</hi> in the day that he <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> eate the forbidden fruite he should <hi>die the death,</hi> he meant not tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall death there, as the event shewes: for such a death was not inflicted upon <hi>Adam</hi> in the day that hee sinned; for after he sinned he lived still in the world naturally, hee continued living many yeares after.</p>
                  <p>I answer, notwithstanding all this <hi>Adam</hi> may bee sayd to die a <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> How <hi>Adam</hi> died a natural death, as soon as he sinned.</note> naturall death as soone as he sinned, because by the guilt of his sinne he then presently became subject to it, and God straight way denounced upon him the sentence of death, therefore it may bee sayd, he straite way dyed. As a condemned person is called a dead man though he be respited for a time.</p>
                  <p>Besides the Messengers and Sergeants of death presently tooke hold of him, and arrested him for sinne, as hunger and thirst, and cold, and diseases, daily wasting of the naturall moysture to the quenching of life. Indeede God suffered him that the sentence was not presently executed, so to commend his owne patience, and to give to <hi>Adam</hi> occasion of salvation, the promise of Christ being after made, and he called to repentance, by that meanes to attaine a better life by Christ, then he lost by sinne.</p>
                  <p>It is objected againe Christ redeemed us from all sinne, and all <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> the punishment thereof; but he did not redeeme us from bodily death, from temporall death: for the faithfull wee see dye still even as others doe: therefore it is concluded by some that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall death is not the <hi>wages of sinne;</hi> for then when wee were free
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:14764:289"/>
from sinne by Christ wee should bee freed from that.</p>
                  <p>Our answer to this is, that Christ hath freede all his elect, not <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> How Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians freed from tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall death.</note> onely from eternall, but even from temporall death, though not from both in the same manner.</p>
                  <p>From temporall death first, in hope of which the Apostle speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. saith <hi>The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning temporall death, at last then it shall be destroyed, <hi>mortall shall</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>put on immortality</hi> as the Apostle speakes: but in the meane time it is destroyed in hope, though it remaine indeede, and must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, even of the faithfull in this life.</p>
                  <p>How be it to them Christ hath changed the nature of it, and <note place="margin">Christians undergoe temporall death, why.</note> now they no longer undergoe it as <hi>the wages of sinne</hi> but for other causes. As first, the exercise of their graces, their faith, and hope, and patience, and the rest: all these are exercised (as in other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions <note place="margin">1.</note> so even) in the death of Gods Children.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the totall remoovall and riddance of the reliques of sinne from which they are not freed in this life: but when they die, <note place="margin">2.</note> then all sinne is taken away: for as at the first sinne brought death into the world, so to the faithfull now death carries it out againe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, their entrance into heaven, and to bee at <hi>home with the Lord,</hi> from whom wee are absent as long as wee are at home in <note place="margin">3.</note> these bodies.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to prepare their bodies for renewing at the last day, <note place="margin">4. Simile.</note> that is done by death: for as a decayed Image or statue must first be broken that it may be new cast: so these bodies of ours must bee broken by death, that they may be cast into a new mold of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie at the generall resurrection. But here as some sinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, so death remaines, though wee be in Christ, yet wee are still in that estate wherein, <hi>it is appointed to all men once to dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus even temporall death is left to the Children of God to bee undergone, before they come to heaven. It is left to them I say, and that justly in respect of the remnants of sinne, yet they undergoe it no other way, but for their owne good and benefit. How ever temporall death in its owne nature to an unbeleever is <hi>the wages of sinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as temporall, so eternall death: for when God told man that in the day hee sinned <hi>he should die the death,</hi> he meant not <note place="margin">2. Eternall death.</note> onely temporall but eternall death, he meant that principally, as I shewed before, in that the Apostle opposeth it to eternall life in the next clause of the sentence; Now Christ hath freede all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers actually from eternall death.</p>
                  <p>But how eternall death should be <hi>the wages of sinne</hi> may be doubted: because betweene the worke and the <hi>the wages</hi> there must be some proportion, that seemes not to bee betweene sinne and
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:14764:289"/>
eternall death: for sinne is a finite, a temporall thing committed in a short time, and that death is eternall. Now to punish a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall fault, with an eternall punishment, it seemes that it is to make the punishment to exceed the fault, and that is against justice.</p>
                  <p>But for answer to this doubt, wee must know, that however sinne considered in the act, and as it is a transcient action it is finite, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Sinne infinite three wayes.</note> yet in other respects it is infinite, and that in a threefold consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
                  <p>First, in respect of the object against whom it is committed: <note place="margin">1. In respect of the object.</note> for being the offence of an infinite Majestie, it deserves an infinite punishment: for wee know offences are reckoned of for their greatnesse, according as the greatnesse of the person is, against whom they are committed. If hee that clippes the Kings coyne, or deface the Kings Armes, or counterfeit the broad Seale of <hi>England,</hi> or the Princes privie Seale, ought to die as a traytor, because this disgrace tends to the person of the Prince: much more ought he that violates the law of God, die, the first and second death too, because it tends to the defacing of the Image, and the disgracing of the person of God himselfe, who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, and dishonoured in every sinne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, sinne is infinite in respect of the subject wherein it <note place="margin">2. The subject.</note> is, the soule of man. Seeing the soule is immortall, and of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting substance, and that the guilt of sinne, and the blot to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether staine the soule, as a crimson, and skarlet die upon wooll: and can no more be severed from the soule then the spottes from the Leopard: it remaines as the soule is eternall, and as that is everlasting, so sinne is infinite in durance, and continuance, and deserves an infinite <hi>wages,</hi> and punishment which is eternall death.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is infinite also in respect of the tie, betweene the <note place="margin">3. The sinners d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thus we see eternall death is <hi>the wages of sinne,</hi> though sinne be committed in a moment, though it bee a transcient action in it selfe, yet it is just with God to give it the wages of eternall death. So you see Death, both temporall and eternall, is <hi>the wages of sinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee come to the Use of the point, being thus declared. <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>First, it teacheth us (contrarie to the Doctrine of the Church

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> they have no originall sin neither, then God should inflict <hi>the wages of sinne,</hi> where there were no sinne, which cannot be, because there is no iniquitie with God. Therefore certaine it is, that after regeneration, this originall lust, though the guilt of it be taken away, yet as sinne it remaines, the substance of it still remaines, and will as long as we live in this world. For it is in us, <note place="margin">Basile.</note> as it is well compared, as the I vie is in the wall, which having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken root so twines, and incorporates it selfe, that it can never bee quite rooted out till the wall be taken down: so, till body and soule be taken asunder by death, there will be no totall riddance of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall corruption, and the depravation of our nature, it is still in us, as appeares by the temporall death, even of the best Saints, of those that are most sanctified in this life, it shewes there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of corruption in them still: for if there were not sinne, there would not be <hi>the wages of sinne:</hi> there would not be death, if there were not sinne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Use of it is to take away a fond Popish distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">

                  <p>We denie not, but that some sins are <hi>veniall,</hi> and some <hi>mortall</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sins mortall, and veniall, how.</note> in another sence, not in respect of the nature of the sin, but of the estate of the person in whom the sins are; so we say all the sins of the Elect are <hi>veniall,</hi> because they either are or shall be pardoned. And all the sins of reprobate persons are <hi>mortall,</hi> because they shall never be pardoned. It is the mercy of God (and not from the nature of the sins) that makes them <hi>veniall:</hi> for otherwise every sin in it selfe considered (be it never so small) is <hi>mortall:</hi> for if it worke according to its owne nature, it workes death of body and soule.</p>
                  <p>It is a foolish exception that they bring against it, that thus we make all sins equall; and that we bring in with the Stoicks, a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of sin, because we say all are mortall. It is a foolish cavill: for it is as if one should argue, because the Mouse, and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, are both living creatures, that therefore they are both of

                  <p>Suppose one should be drowned in the middest of the Sea, and another in a shallow pond: in respect of death all were one, both are drowned: but yet there is great difference in respect of the place, for depth, and danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So there is great difference in this, though the least sin in its owne nature be <hi>mortall,</hi> as the Apostle saith here, <hi>the wages of it is death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, seeing <hi>the wages of sinne is death,</hi> it should teach us <note place="margin">

Had there not beene sin, there would have beene no death: upon the death of the soule came in the death of the body: first the soule died in forsaking God, and then the body died being forsaken of the soule: the soule forsooke God willingly; therefore it was compelled unwillingly to forsake the body. This is the manner how death came into the world by sin, therefore death must put out sin.</p>
                  <p>That housholder, when he saw tares grow among his wheate, hee said to his servants, <hi>the envious man hath done this:</hi> So whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou seest Death seize upon any, say to thy selfe, sinne hath done this: this is <hi>the wages of sinne:</hi> and if man had never sinned; we should have seene no such thing.</p>

At the first sin may be pleasing, but remember the end, the end of it is death.

Or as the Governour of the feast said, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. <hi>All men in the beginning set forth good wine,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>and then that which is worse:</hi> so sinne gives the best at the first,
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:14764:291"/>
but the worst it reserves for the last.</p>
                  <p>This should keepe us from every sin, though it seemes never so pleasing, and never so sweet to us, remembring that the worst is still to come. Wee reade that when the people saw that <hi>Saul</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad <note place="margin">1 Sam 14:</note> them to eate, though they were exceeding hungrie, yet not one of them durst touch the honey for the curse, though they saw it: so the pleasures of sin may drop as honey before our eyes, but we must not adventure to taste of them, because they are cursed fruit, and because of <hi>the wages</hi> that will follow. Never take sinne by the head, by the beginnings, as the greatest part doe; but take it as <hi>Iacob</hi> tooke <hi>Esau, by the heele;</hi> looke to the extreame part of it; <hi>Consider thy end, and thou shalt not doe amisse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iezabell</hi> might have allured a man, when having painted her face shee looked out of the window, but to looke upon her after shee was cast out, eaten of dogges, and nothing remaining but her extreame parts, <hi>her scull, and the palmes of her hands, and her feet,</hi> it could not be but with horrour: so sinne may allure a man, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only on the painted face, in the beginning, but if a man cast his eye upon the extreame parts, it would then affright, and deterre him, for <hi>the wages,</hi> the end of it <hi>is death.</hi> What a world of people runne blindly, and desperatly on, they turne to the race of sinne, <hi>as the horse to the battell</hi> without feare, as if the Psalmists <hi>Tremble, and sinne not,</hi> were rather, <hi>sinne and tremble not.</hi> Whereas we have great cause every one, to tremble at the least motion of sinne in our selves, to which so dreadfull, and wofull wages is due.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, for this point, so many of us as have repented, and have <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 5. To be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and thankfull.</note> already left the service of sin, we must hence learne, as to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in our selves, considering what danger and miserie we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped; so to be more thankful to Christ, that hath freed us from so wretched <hi>wages</hi> due to our sins, and that by taking the whole pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment upon himselfe. For we must know (beloved) that the best of us, <hi>by nature are children of wrath, as well as others:</hi> the stypend that we have earned is eternall death, and surely it hath been payed to us, nothing could have kept it from us, but only the satisfaction of Christ, comming betweene Gods justice and us. Thinke we then if we can, what miserie it is that wee have escaped (as many of us, I meane as be in the state of grace) we have escaped death, the hurt of temporall death, we have escaped eternall death. What is that? a separation from the blessed presence, and glory of God: destruction of body and soule for ever, unutterable torments, companie with the Divell and his angels, and the route of reprobates: darknesse blacker, and thicker then that of Egypt, <hi>Weeping and wayling, and gnashing of teeth</hi> in the infernall lake; <hi>that worme that never dyes, and the fire that never goeth out.</hi> This is <hi>the wages of</hi> all <hi>sinne:</hi> and that it is not rendred to all sinne, and to all sinners, the cause is
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:14764:291"/>
only this, that the payment hath beene already exacted of Christ in the behalfe of all true beleevers; therefore in their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons they are discharged: how infinitely are wee bound in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse to him? and how carefull should wee be to walke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it? resolving never to returne to the service of sinne againe, but to make it our whole studie, that wee may please and honour such a Redeemer, that hath redeemed us from such miserie as this; that wee may please him: for we had deserved eternall death, as well as others, and hee hath not only freed us from that, that wee had most worthily deserved, but most freely also bestowed that upon us, that we could never deserve; for so it followes in the next point.</p>
                  <p>The gift of God is eternall life through Iesus Christ our Lord.</p>
                  <p>That is the second thing to bee considered, the reward of the service of God. You have heard of the reward, <hi>the wages of sinne,</hi> Now the reward of the service of God is eternall life, it is called life. There is a twofold life belongs to men.</p>
                  <p>The one is naturall, and is common to all, good and bad in <note place="margin">Life twofold.</note> this world. <note place="margin">1. Naturall.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other spirituall, proper to the faithfull, begun by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, and the soule, and maintained by the <hi>bond of the spirit:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Spirituall.</note> and this life hath three degrees.</p>
                  <p>The first is in this life unto death; and it begins when wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to believe and repent, and come to a saving knowledge of <note place="margin">1. In this life.</note> God, and of his Sonne Jesus Christ: as it is said, <hi>This is eternall life to know thee to be the very God, and whom thou hast sent Iesus Christ,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job 17. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 3.</p>
                  <p>The second degree is from our death to our resurrection: for in that time our soules being freed from our bodies, are withall free <note place="margin">2. In death.</note> from all sinne, originall, and actuall.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, after the Resurrection, when body and soule shall bee reunited, wee shall have immediate communion and fellowship <note place="margin">3. After the Resurrection.</note> with God, and so enjoy a more perfect and blessed life then ever we could here. And this spirituall life, with all the three degrees of it, is the life here spoken of, especially the last degree, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it in heaven.</p>
                  <p>It is called eternall life, because it shall never end; For a thing <note place="margin">A thing eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall three wayes.</note> is said to be eternall three wayes.</p>
                  <p>First, which hath neither beginning, nor end, so God alone is <note place="margin">1.</note> eternall, and none but he.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, which hath no beginning, and yet shall have an end: <note place="margin">2.</note> so Gods decree is eternall, for it never had a beginning; yet when all things decreed are fulfilled, it shall have an end.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, which hath a beginning, but never shall have end, <note place="margin">3.</note> and so the life of Gods Saints had a beginning, as all created things
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:14764:292"/>
have, butit shall never have an end; and this eternall life, it is called here,
<q>The gift of God through Iesus Christ our Lord.</q>
Because wee cannot deserve it, but it is given, and bestowed on us freely for Christ. So then the point of observation from the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the words is this, that,</p>
                  <p>Our salvation it is the free gift of God, given us onely for the merits of Christ. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Salvation the free gift of God.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>For observe I beseech you the Apostles words, when hee had sayd, <hi>The wayes of sinne is death,</hi> hee doth not adde, and say, but <hi>the wages of righteousnesse is eternall life,</hi> but he calls that <hi>the gift of God.</hi> To make us understand saith <hi>Damascene</hi> that God brings us to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life meerely for his owne mercie, not for our merits, orelse surely the Apostle would have made the later part of the sentence, answerable to the former.</p>
                  <p>But here perhaps some may aske why <hi>eternall life</hi> should not be the <hi>wages</hi> of righteousnesse, as well as death <hi>the wages of sinne?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer, because there is not the same reason betweene sinne and righteousnesse. <note place="margin">Answ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>For first, sinne is our owne, it merits it, but rigteousnesse is none of our owne, it is the holy Ghosts and it is due to God.</p>
                  <p>Then againe sinne is perfectly evill, and so it deserves death, but our righteousnesse inherent is not perfectly good, it is imperfect in this life, and nothing that is imperfectly good can merit (as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) eternall life: therefore the Apostle makes such a manifest diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them, he calls death, <hi>the wages of sin, but eternall life the gift of God,</hi> it is the free gift of God through Christ. Indeed <hi>eternall life</hi> some times, many times in Scripture is called a reward. But there is a reward of mercie as well as of justice. Nay God is sayd sometimes to reward his children injustice. How is that? Though the reward come originally from mercy, yet accidentally it comes to be justice, thus, because God hath tyed himselfe by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to reward, now promise is debt from a just man: Thus the Lord may be accounted a debtor. How? saith Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> as a promiser, if hee had not promised eternall life, otherwise hee <note place="margin">Austin.</note> owes us nothing at all, much lesse <hi>eternall life</hi> which is so great a thing.</p>
                  <p>Yet it may be doubted, how <hi>eternall life is the free gift of God,</hi> seeing it is given for the merits of Christ, as it is here exprest <hi>the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Quest.</note> 
                     <hi>gift of God through Iesus Christ our Lord,</hi> that is, for the merits of Christ; now a man that gives a thing upon merit, hee gives it not freely.</p>
                  <p>I answer it is free in respect of us; whatsoever Christ hath done <note place="margin">Answ.</note> we did not merit it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="565" facs="tcp:14764:292"/>
If it be replyed, Christs merits are made ours, and wee merit in him, and so it cannot be free. I answer, this reason were of force if wee our selves could procure the merits of Christ for us, but that we could not doe, but that also was of free gift, <hi>Ioh. 3. God so</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>loved the world that he gave his onely begotten Son that he that beleeves in him should not perish:</hi> hee gave him freely, of free gift; so that though <hi>eternall life</hi> be due to us by the merits of Christ, yet it is <hi>the free gift of God.</hi> I wil stand no longer in proving the truth of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. I come to the application and use, to conclude with the time.</p>
                  <p>First it serves to confute our adversaries of the Church of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Confutation of merit.</note> 
                     <hi>Rome</hi> in the point of merit. They looke for heaven and <hi>eternall life</hi> as wages, wee see the Apostle teacheth us otherwise, that <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life</hi> is not given in that manner, but another manner of way; It is not given as wages, it is <hi>the free gift of God.</hi> And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. hee saith, that <hi>the sufferings of this life is not worthy of the glory that shall bee</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>revealed:</hi> all our sufferings, all our workes they are not worthy of the glory of God, we cannot properly merit them. This was the constant Doctrine of the primitive Church: that a good life when wee are justified, and an eternall life when wee are glorified; they all grant that all that is good in us is the gift of God; that eternall life is not a retribution to our workes but the free gift of God. When God crownes our merits, hee crownes nothing else but his owne free gift: these and many other sentences wee finde among the ancient Fathers, plainely convincing our adversaries, that in this point they swerve not onely from Scripture, but from all sound antiquitie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, then to come to our selves, this should humble us <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. To humble us.</note> in respect of our owne deservings; doe all the good thou canst, take heede it doe not puffe thee up, thinke not to merit heaven, Alas thou canst not doe it: for <hi>what is it to the Almightie,</hi> (as it is sayd in <hi>Job) that thou art righteous?</hi> Thy well doing extends not to him, thou canst doe him no good, therefore thou canst looke for nothing at his hands since thou canst doe him no good: but all that thou doest in his service, it is not for his but for thy good, yet he commands thee, and thou art bound to doe it, but all thou canst doe is no more then thou art bound to doe. Therefore when thou hast done all that thou canst, acknowledge thy selfe to bee an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable servant,</hi> and thou hast <hi>done no more then thy duty.</hi> If thou hast many good workes, yet thou hast more sinne; and the least sinne of thine in the rigour of justice, will deprive thee of thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in God. Therefore thy appeale must bee to the throne of grace, and thy onely plea must bee that of the Publican, every one of us, <hi>God be mercifull to me a sinner;</hi> when wee have done all wee can, it must be mercie, and not any merit of ours that must bring us to heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="566" facs="tcp:14764:293"/>
Thirdly, here is comfort for the children of God, in that this <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Comfort.</note> inestimable treasure of <hi>eternall life</hi> is not committed to our kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, but God hath it in his keeping. It is his <hi>gift,</hi> it is not committed to the rotten box of our merits, then wee could have no certaintie of it, the devill would easily pick the Locke; yea without picking he would shake in peeces the crazie joynts of the best worke wee doe; he would steale it from us, and take it away, and deprive us of this excellent benefit: but the Lord hath dealt better for us, hee hath kept it in his owne hands, hee hath layd it up in the Cabinet of his owne mercy and love that never failes: for <hi>with everlasting mercie hee hath compassion on us, Esay 54. hee loves us with an everlasting love. It is his mercie that wee are not consumed,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 54.</note> 
                     <hi>because his compassions faile not: and whom hee loves he loves to the end.</hi> It is layd up in the mercy of God, hee will have it his gift; least we should keepe it, and it should be lost, hee hath reserved it in his owne hands. Therefore in temptations when they drive us to doubt of our attaining of <hi>eternall life,</hi> let us cast our eye upon the keeper of it, it is the Lord, he is warie to discerne, and faithfull to bestow it: therefore let us comfort our selves and say every one of us as Saint <hi>Paul, 2 Tim. 1. 12. I know whom I have trusted and I am perswaded that hee is able to keepe that which I have committed to him</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>against that day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, seeing <hi>eternall life is the free gift of God,</hi> it must make us thankefull to him for it; which wee should never doe, if we deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 4. Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> it; doth a master thanke his servant for doing his dutie? So, if wee did thinke heaven were our due, we should never be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for it. Pride is a great enemy to thankefulnesse; therefore the way is to humble our selves, and to consider that wee deserve no good thing at Gods hands, then wee will take this great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit at Gods hands most thankefully. Especially when wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, it is all that God requires of us, as he saith, <hi>Psal. 50. Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will heare thee and deliver thee,</hi> and what <note place="margin">Psal. 50:</note> shalt thou doe? <hi>Thou shalt glorifie me.</hi> Glorifying God, and being thankefull to him is all the tribute wee are to pay to this our royall Lord; and shall we deny him this? It is a small benefit that is not worth thankes; We set eternall life at too low a rate, if wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to bee thankefull. There was never a precious Iewell affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded so cheape as <hi>eternall life</hi> for our thankefulnesse.</p>
                  <p>If wee did know what it were to want it, we would give ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand worlds rather then be without it. Therefore as <hi>Naamans</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants sayd to him concerning his washing in <hi>Iordan, If the Prophet had commanded thee a greater thing, wouldest thou not have done it?</hi> So if God had commanded us a great matter for <hi>eternall life</hi> wee should have done it; how much more, when he saith take it, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; be but thankefull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="565" facs="tcp:14764:293"/>
Thus I have described to you this twofold seruice, <hi>the wages of sinne,</hi> that is, <hi>death,</hi> temporall, eternall: The service of <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> the wages, and reward of that, <hi>eternall life,</hi> which is not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges <hi>but the gift of God.</hi> So that I may now say to you as <hi>Moses</hi> did to <hi>Israel, Deut. 30. 19. Behold I have set before you life and death, cursing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 30. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>and blessing.</hi> Therefore choose not cursing, chuse not sinne, nor <hi>the wages</hi> thereof, it is death: but <hi>choose life, that you and your seede may live.</hi> If wee follow sinne, the <hi>wages</hi> will be death; if wee apply our selves to righteousnesse in the service of God, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shall be <hi>eternall life,</hi> not that wee deserve it, but that it is the pleasure of our heavenly Father to bestow it upon us. <hi>For the wages of sinne is death, and the gift of God is eternall life, through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi>

                  <p>In the later end of the tenth Chapter, you have the Apostle there, first dogmatically handling the doctrine of <hi>Faith,</hi> as the necessary meanes to attaine everlasting life, and as the principall conducement to the possession of glory, and to the saving of the soule; <hi>The just shall live by Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the eleventh Chapter, he sheweth the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute necessitie of <hi>Faith,</hi> to an acceptable walking, and well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God; <hi>For without faith</hi> (vers. 6.) <hi>it is impossible to please God:</hi> and the whole Chapter is further spent in setting downe the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Examples, of <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the rest of <hi>the Elders,</hi> eminent for their <hi>Faith, by which</hi> (saith hee) <hi>they received a good report:</hi> All whom, did worthily in their dayes, and are now become famous to posteritie; standing out to this day, as so many living voyces, calling upon us to <hi>become followers of them,</hi> that we might together with them, bee at length made partakers of <hi>the glorious inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apostle, having spoken much to this purpose, goeth on, to that other grace we spake of, so necessarie to the constitution of a Christian, and to the enabling of him to a well and faithfull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of his Calling, and condition, and that is <hi>Patience.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by way of exhortation in the first part of this twelfth Chapter; and urged with respect to the necessarie uses of it, both concerning duties done, and afflictions to be endured, in the verses following.</p>
                  <p>First with respect to duties, which the Apostle propoundeth under the Metaphor of <hi>running in a race</hi> (for such is the course of a Christian life; which the Saints of God are called to the fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of) <hi>Let us runne the race that is set before us; and runne with Patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is urged with respect to sufferings, and that of two sorts, from men, from God.</p>
                  <p>From men, from whom the faithfull are to make account of sufferings in divers kindes, in shame and derision, in proud and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent contradictions. and (according to their power and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie) in bloudy persecutions, <hi>You have not yet resisted unto bloud,</hi> uerse 4.</p>
                  <p>From God: and here the Apostle is more large, urging his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to <hi>Patience,</hi> and a quiet applying of our selves to God, according to all the states and conditions he is pleased to bring us unto, and according to all his severall administrations towards us; very strongly, labouring to fasten it in the hearts of the Saints of God, as <hi>a nayle in a sure place;</hi> first alledging that same passage of <hi>Solomon</hi> in the Proverbs; <hi>My sonne, despise not thou the chastening of
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:14764:296"/>
the Lord,</hi> And then he further strengthneth his exhortation by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible arguments. (I doe but touch upon these things, hastening on to the maine thing I intend; only desiring to give you a plaine, and briefe Analasis of this Scripture, with the context of it.) The Apostle (I say) driveth on this exhortation by strength of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</p>
                  <p>And that first of all, by propounding to the godly, that whereas the Lord is pleased, to exercise them with afflictions; to make them drinke many times of a cuppe of bitternesse, yet they have reason to be quiet and patient, because this way the Lord giveth a proofe of his love to his children: and those that are wise and godly, will be glad (they have reason so to be) that God should take sucha course with them, as whereby he may give them a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of his deare love and affection: Now herein the Lord evidenceth his love and affection to his people; for all the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and chastisements that he exerciseth them withall, flow from his love, and are as fruits thereof, <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>whom the Lord lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, hee chasteneth, and scourgeth every sonne whom hee receiveth,</hi> verse 6.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he propoundeth it to their consideration as a course wherein the Lord giveth an evidence of his peoples adoption: <hi>For, what sonne is hee whom the Father chasteneth not? But if yee bee without chastisement, where of all his children are partakers, then are yee bastards and not sonnes,</hi> vers. 78. Now the godly should be glad, to have the Lord take such a course with them, and so to order out his administrations concerning them, as that they may have some comfortable evidence to their soules, that they are his adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ones, and such as hee will one day acknowledge for to bee his children.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly, and that which more concerneth our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: the Apostle urgeth his exhortation by a comparison that he frameth, betweene God, <hi>the Father of spirits,</hi> and men, that are <hi>fathers of our flesh: we have had fathers of our flesh, and they verely, for a few daies chastened us, and wee gave them reverence; shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live? they cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened us for their pleasure, but Hee, for our profit, that wee might bee partakers of his holinesse.</hi> Wherein you see the comparison is laid out in severall particulars; and the preheminencie, the advantage of the comparison is given to God; for so is the scope and intent of the Text.</p>
                  <p>It lieth thus briefly; First, <hi>Wee have had fathers of our flesh, and God is the Father of Spirits;</hi> if we have beene contented to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe the discipline of our earthly fathers, much more have we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son quietly and patiently to submit our selves to the proceedings of <hi>the Father of our spirits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="574" facs="tcp:14764:297"/>
Secondly; <hi>They for a few dayes chastened us, and we gave them reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;</hi> it is but a few dayes neither, that <hi>the Father of spirits</hi> meaneth to keepe us under his discipline: suppose it be all our time, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it shall be so, yet all that is, but the time of our minoritie; and therefore if we have beene content to submit to our earthly parents theirdiscipline for a few dayes, <hi>shall we not much more be in subjection to the Father of spirits,</hi> to his chastisement, though it befor our life-time? for the disproportion is infinitely greater between the time of this life compared with the state of maturitie and ripe age which the Saints shall come to hereafter; and the time of our minoritie and childhood compared with the state of full age and man-hood in this life; for alas, how short are our dayes! <hi>they are spent, even as a tale that is told.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But lastly, that the Apostle might over-power the spirits of the godly, and quiet their mindes, and make them compose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to a patient waiting upon God, and a willing submission to whatsoever condition hee shall bring them into; <hi>Our earthly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> (saith he) <hi>according to their pleasure,</hi> and many times in the strength of passion, and with over-much unadvisednesse and heat of bloud, not so much respecting the weake condition of their children, <hi>chastened us; but he,</hi> that is, our heavenly Father, <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of spirits, for our profit;</hi> and what profit? <hi>that we might be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of his holinesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is an Argument (I conceive) very suteable to the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our meeting together at this time, in regard of those whom more especially, and neerely it concerneth, the Parents of this deceased young Gentleman; whom the Lord is pleased now deeply to afflict, and to reach out to them a bitter Cuppe; I shall endeavour therefore to speake somewhat in this Argument: And though it concernes them in a more speciall manner; yet, it is a meditation, that concernes us all to take knowledge of; and such a one, as if we belong to God, and that the Lord hath a purpose to bring to heaven, we shall have occasion in our time, to make of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten use of.</p>
                  <p>Passing over therefore other things, let us come to consider of this later part of the verse; and of the later part of the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son here framed by the Apostle, in order to the strengthning of his maine Argument, whereby he urgeth his exhortation, to the patient bearing of those Afflictions that God shall bee pleased to exercise us withall: <hi>Our earthly parents for a few dayes chastened us after their owne pleasure, but Hee, the Father of our spirits, for our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, that hee might make us a partaker of his holinesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the words themselves, wee have to consider these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: And the maine pillars of our discourse for the present (letting passe the rest) shall be these severalls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="575" facs="tcp:14764:297"/>
First, we are to take knowledge of this point in the generall, viz. <hi>That God Almighty is graciously set to procure, and further the good and profit of his people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, and more particularly, <hi>That in all the afflictions and chastisements hee bringeth upon his people, his eye and ayme is at their good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly; <hi>The great profit, and benefit that God aymeth at, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to his people in all his fatherly administrations, especially of casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, is, that hee might make them partaker of his holinesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I begin with the first, and the more generall point. You see <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Propos.</hi> 1. God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to set himselfe to procure the profit of his people.</note> the Text importeth it plaine enough, that God Almightie is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously set, for to procure, and promote, and further the good, and benefit, and profit of his people, of such as feare his name, of such as he is pleased to receive for his owne: his heart (I say) is set upon them to doe them good, he is studious of their profit, hee hath a due respect to their benefit, in all his dealings and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations to them.</p>
                  <p>Next to his owne glorie, (which is dearest to him of all things else, and good reason too, for that is better then salvation and eternall happinesse. But I say next to his owne glorie) and the glorie of his beloved sonne Jesus Christ; the maine thing that hee aymeth at, is, that he might make his people happy with him; and that they might be every way profited, and advantaged both in soule and body; and furthered to eternall happinesse.</p>
                  <p>This will appeare to us, if we consider first, <note place="margin">Proved by instances.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ordinances of God, which he hath appointed in order to his peoples good.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if we consider his commandements and impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if wee consider all his various administrations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them.</p>
                  <p>All which will clearely manifest to us, that Gods ayme in all, is, at the profit and benefit of his people.</p>
                  <p>I shall touch but upon some particulars, and on them neither I shall but onely glance; because I would keepe my selfe within the compasse of the time.</p>
                  <p>First, consider the Lords ordinances that he hath provided for <note place="margin">1. In his institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in the Church.</note> his people, and calleth them out to give attendance upon; they are all with respect to his peoples profit, and an eye to that. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;</p>
                  <p>That great ordinance which God hath set up in his Church, <note place="margin">1. The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Word. Act. 26. 18.</note> namely, that of preaching, and dispensing of the sacred misteries of the Gospell; it is with respect to his peoples profit; <hi>To open their eyes, and to turne them from darknesse to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgivenesse of sinnes, and an
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:14764:298"/>
inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith in Christ;</hi> That they might be brought <hi>into the fellowship of this misterie,</hi> and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with all the treasures of the Gospell. And the Apostle saith, <hi>that all Scripture</hi> (which this ordinance of Preaching is to be conversant about, that Scripture which wee are to breake abroad <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16.</note> among you this way) <hi>it is profitable;</hi> Profitable <hi>for Doctrine, for reproofe, for instruction, for correction; and it will make the man of God perfect;</hi> So profitable, as that it is able to perfect a man, to make him <hi>wise to salvation;</hi> and we need no more wisedome.</p>
                  <p>The like might I speake concerning the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; It is instituted of God with an eye to his peoples <note place="margin">2. The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supper.</note> benefit, that they may come to be made partakers of that profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>flesh and bloud</hi> (for so I may justly call it) <hi>of the Lord Iesus. It is not the bloud of Bulls and of Goats;</hi> it is not the bloud of all the men in the world, that is profitable for such purposes, as the paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the wrath of God, the quenching of the flames of his displeasure, <hi>the purging of the conscience from dead workes;</hi> of those wee may say as <hi>David</hi> in another case, <hi>what profit is there in my bloud?</hi> But there is profit in the bloud of Christ, and with respect to that, this ordinance is provided in the Church, that the people of God, attending thereon according to his institution may come to be made partakers of the vertue and benefit thereof; having the remission of their sinnes, thereby sealed up to their consciences through faith in that bloud.</p>
                  <p>The like Instance might I give of Prayer, and the rest of those holy ordinances which God hath set up in his Church; but I will <note place="margin">3. Prayer:</note> name no more, lest I be prevented. Onely by the way consider this: Most unworthily doe we deale with God, with Preaching, with the Sacrament, and with all these holy ordinances, if so bee wee doe not reape profit, and benefit by them: A soule that liveth unprofitably under the dispensation of these, doth but <note place="margin">Vnprofitable living under the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, a taking the name of God in vaine.</note> 
                     <hi>take the name of God in vaine:</hi> Every time wee come to heare the Word preached, and to attend upon the Sacrament, and goe away from them, no better then we were when we came to them, wee <hi>take the name of God in vaine;</hi> and deale unworthily with these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things: They are given to profit with, and wee shall but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease our owne guiltinesse, if we be not profited by them.</p>
                  <p>But I say (brethren) this is that which God hath respect unto in all his provisions for his people, in the Institution of all his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; their profit and benefit: and when he findeth any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that is not for the benefit of his people, though they bee of his owne institution, yet hee takes them away; therefore the Apostle speaking concerning the Mosaycall Rites and institutions of the Ceremoniall Law, he calleth them unprofitable, and <hi>beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly rudiments,</hi> and so God himselfe counted of them, and for
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:14764:298"/>
their unprofitablenesse, there was a gracious disanulment of them.</p>
                  <p>But especially and above all, this will be most apparant if we <note place="margin">4. Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ng of Christ into the world in our nature.</note> cast our eyes upon the Lord Jesus, who is indeede the substance of our preaching; and of our receiving the Sacrament, and of all the ordinances of God, and of all his promises: it is with respect to our profit that the Lord hath beene pleased to ordaine him, both in respect of his person, and the constitution of that; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his offices, and all his fatherly administrations concerning him: a gracious respect hee hath had in all to the profit of his Church, as might appeare in the severall particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A body hast thou prepared for mee</hi> (saith hee in the <hi>Psalme)</hi> why? That Christ might be the more profitable to his people; sitted thereby to converse with, and to communicate himselfe unto them. <hi>The Word was made flesh,</hi> and therefore <hi>made flesh that he might dwell among us;</hi> that there might bee a meete cohabitation with him.</p>
                  <p>And as this was the respect God had in his incarnation, so it was in all his humiliation. What was the reason that <hi>hee was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with sorrowes and griefes,</hi> and miseries, both from God and men? but that hee might be the more for our profit; that wee might have <hi>a mercifull High Priest,</hi> that he might the better know from experience the way to commiserate, and compassionate his people in their distresse.</p>
                  <p>Yea in his death, in his resurrection, in his ascention, in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment at Gods right hand; in all these administrations of God the Father concerning his Sonne, hee had a gracious respect to the good and profit, and benefit of his people.</p>
                  <p>Againe secondly, consider all the appointments of God, his <note place="margin">2. In his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction. Deut. 10. 13.</note> injunctions and commands to his people; hee doth in all ayme at their profit; as it is in <hi>Deut. All these things I command thee for thy good.</hi> The Lord requireth nothing at his peoples hands but it is for their profit: He calleth upon us to believe, it is that wee might have the profit of his word and promises. Hee calleth upon us to repent and to leave our sinfull wayes, <hi>if thine eye offend thee plucke it out, if thy hand offend thee cut it off, for it is profitable for thee that one</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Matth. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should bee cast into hell;</hi> he hath an ayme at our profit, wee thinke hard of it (as wee are naturally apt to doe, through a deepe affection wee beare to our base lusts) that God should come so neare to us and deale so strictly with us, as to command us to plucke out our eyes, and cut off our hands, that is, to part with our dearest corruptions; Alas (my brethren) if God saw that it were good for us, that it were for our profit to keepe our lusts, he would not take away one of them from us, but we should have them (as I may say) with all
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:14764:299"/>
his heart: but hee knoweth that as they are not for his glory, so they are not for our profit, he seeth that there is not any good to be gotten by our retayning of them; therefore it is (I say) that he is so strict in his impositions, that hee so often calleth upon his people to repent and to cast away their sinnes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and lastly, consider all the administrations of God to <note place="margin">3. In his several administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 1. Permitting sin to remain.</note> his people, and wee shall see that in them all hee hath a respect to their profit. As for instance: he is pleased to suffer sinne and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to remaine in his servants all the while they are in this life, he could wholly take it away and free them from it, even in this world: But he knowes that it is for their profit to suffer these Inmates, these <hi>Cananites</hi> to remaine that they <hi>may be as prickes in their eyes and thornes in their sides;</hi> to make them the more weary of the world, and the more desirous of heaven.</p>
                  <p>He is pleased many times to suffer his people to have sinne not <note place="margin">2. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile.</note> onely tirannizing and usurping, but prevayling against them; but it is that thereby they may attaine to a greater degree of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He suffereth them sometimes to fall, for this very purpose that he might exalt them. Hee is pleased to permit the Divell to buffet them, and to use them very hardly: were it not for their profit, hee would tye him up in Hell, and give him no such leave as this; but (as he sayd to Saint <hi>Paul) least they should be exalted above measure, the messenger of Sathan is sent to buffet them,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea the Lords withholding of his spirituall comforts; his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting <note place="margin">3. Withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</note> of his people, the hyding of his face from them, the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of those sweet and gracious manifestations of himselfe unto them, it is all with respect to their profit; that they may be taught the more to prize the comforts of his spirit, and to walke more worthy of them when they doe enjoy them. <note place="margin">4. Suspending his answer to their prayers.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is pleased sometime to suspend his answering of their prayers, and to hold them long in the expectation of the returne of their requests: it is for their profit; that they may bee thereby stirred up to ply <hi>the Throne of grace</hi> with more frequent and earnest praiers; that so the greater their adventure is (as I may say) the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their returne may be: It being in this case with them as it is with Merchants, the greater adventure they send forth, and the longer their ship is out, the greater and more advantageous is the returne.</p>
                  <p>Many times againe, hee is pleased not onely to suspend his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer <note place="margin">5. Denying their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar suites.</note> to their prayers, but to deny the granting of his peoples request in the very kinde they sue for: But even in this too hee hath respect to their profit: hee heareth them (as one well sayd) according to their profit, thou gh not according to their wills: so he dealt with <hi>Moses</hi> concerning his request of entring into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe the Lord is pleased to keepe his people many times in a
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:14764:299"/>
low condition, and in meane estate, to put them into bare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and hard pastures, while others are grazing in full med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes; it is with respect to their profit, to teach them the more to depend upon him, to enable them the better to live by Faith.</p>
                  <p>Againe, for this purpose hee takes from his servants deare bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, <note place="margin">6. Deprives them of their dearest bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings:</note> the Wife from the Husband; the Children from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; as wee see verified this day in this place, concerning our friends here, the mournefull survivers and attendants upon this sad occasion; but in these administrations hee intendeth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples profit, as wee may see in the case of <hi>Iob;</hi> the Lord takes away all his children, but (saith the Apostle) <hi>yee have heard of the patience</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iames 5. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>of Iob, and have seene the end of the Lord:</hi> hee was no looser in the conclusion, but God returned at length all into his bosome againe, nay double.</p>
                  <p>In a word, for this very purpose it is, even for their profit (for alas it is not Gods owne benefit hee seekes after but his peoples in all his administrations) that they live, that they doe, that they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that they dye; their death is in order to their gaine, as the Apostle saith, <hi>to me to live is Christ, and to die is gaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To make some application of this, and so to proceede. <note place="margin">Use of exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, let us here take occasion, as many as are the called of God according to his purpose; and implanted in this glorious relation <note place="margin">1.</note> of children to a father; let us learne to advance his name; and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his name, let his prayse be in all the Congregations of the Saints.</hi> Truely (as <hi>Moses)</hi> sayd once) <hi>their Rocke is not as our Rocke:</hi> So may wee say, other fathers are not as this Father, our Father is set for the good and profit of his children. The divell is a father, so our Saviour speakes, <hi>you are of your father the divell;</hi> hee hath children, and he studieth nothing so much as that they may live all their daies in pleasure; striving to leade his followers altogether in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant paths: But alas hee hath no ayme at their profit, it is their losse hee seekes; and therefore at last hee makes them pay full deare for all their pleasure and content. But now God, hee is a wise Father, and in all his dispensations to his children (though they seeme for the present unpleasant) hee hath an ayme at their profit. Let this be for his prayse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let us labour to beleeve this, that God in all his <note place="margin">2.</note> dealings and administrations towards us, hath an eye to our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. How hard soever the condition be that he putteth us into, if he take from us <hi>the desire of our eyes,</hi> the delight of our hearts, our liberties, our estates, our children; yet be perswaded of this, that God doth it for my good and benefit.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, labour to reape the fruit and benefit that God aymeth at and intendeth, and would have us receive from all his <note place="margin">3.</note> administrations. When we are called together to give attendance
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:14764:300"/>
upon the preaching of the Word; then thinke, what am I come hither for? is it not for my profit? would God have me trifle out my time? surely the Lord would never have singled out a day of seven for himselfe, but that hee might likewise make his people partaker of spirituall advantages, and heavenly benefits; and therefore I lose a day, and never heare well, except I heare to profit. And thus what I say of this Ordinance, I might likewise speake of the rest before named. And so for this present occasion; the Lord now you see is pleased to call us to <hi>the house of mourning.</hi> Was it thinke yee? the purpose of God, that wee should meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether here in a customarie complimentall manner, to doe things in a common garpe, only to eate together, and drinke together? No, the Lord calleth us to <hi>a house of mourning,</hi> for our profit, that we might <hi>consider the end of all men, and that wee that are living, might lay the thing to heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for you that are in present distresse, in regard of this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affliction; reckon upon this, that God hath done this for your profit; labour yee therefore to reape the fruit of it; bee not so much poring upon the affliction, and altogether complaining of the bitternesse of the cup; but follow on after the profit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit that God intendeth you thereby. And let every one labour to improve all administrations of God to this purpose; that as he in them all intendeth our good, so let us pursue after the benefit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let it instruct us further concerning our dutie: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to walke worthy of such a God as many of us as are in <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Of Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> relation to him, as children to a Father, and servants to a Master; How should this first of all, winne us over to such a Father, to such a Master? and to make it our highest ambition, to <note place="margin">1.</note> be the people of such a God, the children of sucha Father, that is devoted to the profit and advantage of his children and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants? This is the gracious goodnesse of God, he takes pleasure in the prosperitie of his servants: their profit is his pleasure: Let us therefore walke worthy of such a Father, of such a Master; And seeing he intendeth our profit, and that wee cannot profit him, let us labour <hi>to walke in all well-pleasing:</hi> Wee cannot profit him, let us labour to please him.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, here is a word of instruction for Ministers, wee should <note place="margin">2.</note> in this case (as those that are intrusted with the sacred ordinances of God) labour to put on the minde of God (so the Apostle, we have, saith he, <hi>the mind of Christ.)</hi> Wee in the course of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, as God aymeth at his peoples profit, so should wee, not ayme at our owne praise, and at our profiting by them, but that we might profit their soules. O blessed Preaching, when people profit by our preaching, when they are by that increased in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in love, in faith, in every grace. Such a Preacher was Saint
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:14764:300"/>
                     <hi>Paul: I please all men</hi> (saith he, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. ult. but how?) <hi>not seeking mine owne profit, but the profit of many, that they may bee saved.</hi> Oh <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 33.</note> labour to preach profitably, that our people may thrive under our ministerie. This is that which God aymeth at, and this is that which we should ayme at too.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have done with the first, and more generall propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition arising from the words of Text. I come now to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and more particular thing that we are to consider hence, and that is, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As God graciously setteth himselfe to procure his peoples profit in all</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Propos.</hi> 2. Gods ayme in afflicting his children, is their profit.</note> 
                     <hi>his administrations; so this is that hee aymeth at, in all the afflictions and chastisements, he exerciseth them withall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is no pleasure for him to be lashing and whipping his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to hold them under such sharpe discipline, it is for the profit of his children: so the Text expresseth it, but he for our profit.</p>
                  <p>Which first of all implieth, that Afflictions and chastisements are a meanes conducing to the profit of those that undergoe them: A point plaine in the Text, and the Scripture abundant in the proofe of it; and the experience of the Saints in a plentifull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner confirming it. <hi>It is good for mee</hi> (saith <hi>David) that I have beene afflicted.</hi> And <hi>Ioseph</hi> giveth this honourable testimonie of God, <hi>The Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath caused mee to be fruitfull in the land of my</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen 41. 52.</note> 
                     <hi>affliction;</hi> and thereupon giveth his child a name suteable.</p>
                  <p>Afflictions and chastisements, they become profitable, as the <note place="margin">Afflictions they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</note> furnace to the gold, to purge out the drosse, to make a separation betweene the pure mettall, and the ore.</p>
                  <p>Profitable, as physicke to the body, to purge out the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant humours.</p>
                  <p>Profitable, as sope to the cloth, to fetch out the staines, to take out the greasie spottes (it is the Scripture expresion, <hi>their hearts are as fatte as grease)</hi> to make them white.</p>
                  <p>Profitable, as the Thunder to the Ayre, to purge it, to make it more commodious to breathe in.</p>
                  <p>Profitable, as the wind to the water, to make it the purer by its ventillation.</p>
                  <p>Profitable, as the pruning knife to the tree, to make it more fruitfull.</p>
                  <p>These, and the like metaphors we have, and by them wee are to conceive of the good, and benefit that comes to us by Gods castigation, and fatherly exercising of his people with his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and rod of Affliction.</p>
                  <p>But what are these blessed fruits, what is the profit accruing to the soule of the people of God by this meanes?</p>
                  <p>I can but name part of them. Besides that which is exprest in <note place="margin">The blessed fruit of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</note> the Text, that we might bee partaker of his holinesse, there are
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:14764:301"/>
these gracious effects of afflictions. Weaning from the world: a bringing us into more acquaintance with God. <hi>Manasseth</hi> when hee was in affliction, <hi>hee besought the Lord his God, and humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe greatly before the God of his Fathers, and prayed unto him; and then</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Chron. 33. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>:</note> (saith the Text) <hi>he knew that the Lord hee was God.</hi> God by this meanes makes us know our selves: the vanitie of the creature; the sinfulnesse of sinne; the sweetnesse of the Word; the excellency that is in the promises; makes us more compassionate to others; keepeth us from hell; and many other fruites there are of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                  <p>But to passe this.</p>
                  <p>A second thing implied in the Doctrine is this, that as afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are meanes conducing to our profit, so God in exercising his people with them mainly intendeth it. <hi>The Lord</hi> (saith <hi>Moses) led</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 8. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>thee through that great and terrible wildernesse, wherein were fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and Scorpions, and drought, where there was no water, suffered thee to hunger, brought thee into hard straites;</hi> but what was Gods ayme in this? <hi>that hee might humble thee; and that hee might prove thee, to doe thee good at the later end. By this</hi> (saith the Prophet, <note place="margin">Isa. 27. 9.</note> speaking of the afflictions of the Church) <hi>shall the iniquitie of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his sinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I say is that which God intendeth by the afflictions of his people: and this is that which the servants of God, by faith have beene able to apprehend, and to interpret the Lords meaning in all his sharpe dispensations towards them: As the Prophet <hi>Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk,</hi> having made a terrible description of the Babylonish rod, hee concludes in the twelfth verse of his first Chapter; <hi>Art not thou</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Hab. 1. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>from everlasting, O Lord my God? Wee shall not die, O Lord, thou hast ordained them for Iudgement; and O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is that likewise which the Saints of God have looked for, <note place="margin">The Saints of God have waited for the profit of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, 2 Sam. 16. 12.</note> and expected, that while the windes of afflictions have beene blowing, some ship or other should come home richly fraighted. So <hi>David,</hi> when that storme of cursing came from the mouth of <hi>Shimei: Oh</hi> (saith <hi>David) let him alone, let him curse, it may be that the Lord will looke on mine affliction, and that the Lord will requite good for his cursing this day.</hi> So when <hi>Rabshaketh</hi> came up against <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> Let him alone (saith <hi>Hezekiah) answer him not a word, it may be the Lord will heare the words of Rabshaketh, whom his Master</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 37. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the Lord hath heard;</hi> It may be the Lord will open his eare upon this rage and blasphemie, and consider his people and doe them good. The Saints of God, I say, have expected good, and benefit from Gods afflicting of them.</p>
                  <p>For the use of this, and so to draw to a conclusion. In the first <note place="margin">

place: Seeing this is Gods intent in all his administrations to his people, especially in his castigations of them, and reaching out unto them such sharpe and bitter potions. It may serve to checke and controule all those hard thoughts, that wee are apt to suffer to lodge within us, concerning Gods dealing with us, in the time of our distresses. Apt we are to speak foolishly and unadvisedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren prone to misconster the intent of God in their afflictions. 1 Sam. 27. 1. Esa. 6. 5.</note> God, and to misconster his administrations. This hath beene the frailtie of Gods dearest servants in their affliction. <hi>I shall one day</hi> (said <hi>David) perish by the hand of Saul. Woe is mee</hi> (saith <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saiah) for I am undone, because I am a man of uncleane lips. The Lord</hi> (saith the Church) <hi>hath broken my teeth with gravell stones, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered me with ashes, he hath removed my soule farre off from peace, and I said my strength and my hope is perished from the Lord. The Lord</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 16. 18 Isa. 49. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>hath forsaken me</hi> (saith <hi>Zion) and my Lord hath forgotten mee. Iob</hi> though for a good while hee carried himselfe very fairely, and demeaned himselfe very warily toward God; yet when he began to be wet to the skinne, then he speakes foolishly, and unadvised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, falleth to <hi>the cursing of his day;</hi> not to the cursing of his God; as Sathan thought he would, but of his day, though that was too much, and ill beseeming so holy a man, The Saints, I say, are apt to mistake themselves this way, and to overshoote themselves in this case. We should therefore humble our selves before the Lord for this distemper of soule, and labour to keepe downe such unquiet thoughts, and hard disputings that are apt to rise within us against God, and his dispensations: And consider, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever our thoughts are, <hi>yet the Lord knoweth his owne thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us;</hi> as he himselfe speakes in <hi>Ier.</hi> 29. howsoever (saith he) <note place="margin">Jer. 29. 11.</note> you may thinke that I intend to cut you off for ever, <hi>yet I know my thoughts that I thinke towards you, even thoughts of peace, and not of evill, to give you an expected end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe secondly, it may serve to comfort the godly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. For comfort.</note> all the meanes and instruments of their sufferings, whether they be men or divels. Wicked men and divels whom God useth as a Rod to chastise his people, their malice is great, and their rage violent, and they march on with much furie against the godly; they intend their utter ruine and devastation, and purpose nothing lesse. <hi>But O Assyrian</hi> (saith God) <hi>the rodde of mine anger, and the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 10. 57.</note> 
                     <hi>staffe in their hand is mine indignation: howbeit hee meaneth not so, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth his heart thinke so, but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off;</hi> But (saith the Lord) whatsoever his meaning is, I know what my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are; hee is but the rodde in mine hand, and I will give such strokes with it, as my people may beare, and such as may bee for their profit. This, I say, should comfort us concerning all the instruments of our suffering, whatsoever they be. The Phisitian, <note place="margin">Simile.</note> you know, applieth the horseleaches to his distempered Patient,
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:14764:302"/>
the Horseleech intendeth nothing but the satiating and filling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the blood of the sicke partie; but the Physitian hath another ayme, even the drawing out of the putrified and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted blood. God suffereth wicked men and divels as Horseleeches to suck his people, to draw their blood, but it is in order to their good; it is no matter what wicked men thinke, though <hi>Ashur</hi> thinke not so, yet God purposeth it, and aymes at it, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion effects it; and <hi>then</hi> (saith hee) <hi>it shall come to passe that when the Lord hath performed his whole worke upon mount Sion, I will punish</hi>

                     <hi>the fruit of the stout heart of the King of Assyria, and the glory of his high lookes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe in the third place. Seeing this is Gods ayme in all his afflictions, whatsoever the instrument be, how sharpe soever the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Exhortation to a patient expectation of the fruit of affliction.</note> castigation be, or of what nature, whether it be in a spirituall way by sore temptations and buffetings of Sathan, or outwardly by losses in our estate, or death of friends, &amp;c. seeing I say this is Gods purpose and intent that his people may be profited; Let us quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and patiently apply our selves unto God, and expect the <hi>quiet and peaceable fruit of righteousnesse, that shall spring up in due time, to those that are this way exercised by the Lord:</hi> Looke for it and presse on to this, quietly to waite on the Lord our God for a blessed fruit of such administrations.</p>
                  <p>An argument <hi>ab utili,</hi> is an argument of great prevayle: what will not men doe for Profit? It is for profit that men rise up early and goe to bed late, and eate the bread of carefulnesse. The Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman takes much paines and plowes his ground, indures many sharpe stormes, and piercing winters; the Machant runnes divers hazards abroad, and all for profit: so should we, be willing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently and quietly to submit to Gods dealing, humbly to apply our selves to his wise and fatherly administrations, seeing hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth by it our profit. And take heede of murmuring and repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning against the Lord: this will make him indeede to lay heavier blowes upon us; an impatient Patient makes the Physitian deale more harshly, and a strugling child procureth for himselfe the more and sorer stripes; what though our potion bee bitter, so long as it is wholesome, have wee not reason to submit our selves?</p>
                  <p>But here is the mayne thing wee sticke at. You may happily reply; Indeed if we could see our corruptions subdued, our hearts <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> humbled, the pride that is within us abated, and that God would be pleased to bring us more nearer to him, and make us more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly minded, and weane our affections from the world, if wee could see this fruite of all our sufferings and temptations and crosses, it would be an abundant satisfaction to our soules; but alas, alas, wee cannot see this profit; our hearts are still full of
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:14764:302"/>
many spirituall distempers, and great prevaylings of evill there is upon us; notwithstanding all these Stormes and Frosts, and tempestuous hard Winters, yet these weeds of wickednesse grow and are marvelous lively: this is the bitternesse of the cup, and this is that which sinketh the heart most under all those pressures which lye upon us.</p>
                  <p>To which I answer, first, wee must judge rightly and wisely; <note place="margin">Answ.</note> and consider well whether it be the time for the fruite of affliction <note place="margin">1.</note> to spring forth. <hi>No affliction for the present seemeth joyous,</hi> and no affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it may be for the time of its working appeareth commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: But (saith the Apostle) they doe bring forth <hi>the quiet fruite of righteousnesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe secondly, wee may perhaps beare too much upon the <note place="margin">2.</note> physicke: alas! afflictions and crosses of themselves they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drive us further then draw us nearer unto God; wee are therefore to submit our selves unto God in his way of administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to intreate his blessing upon them, that through that they may be made successefull. As <hi>every creature,</hi> so every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of prosperitie and adversitie, <hi>is sanctified to us by the Word and by prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And take heede of disputing against the Lord, as wee are apt to <note place="margin">3.</note> doe, he is wise above all that wee can conceive, he is wonderfull in working, and knoweth how to bring about the good of his people in a wonderfull way: what if he will plunge thee into the mire in order to holinesse? what if Christ will put clay upon a mans eyes in order to sight? a medicine more likely to put out his eyes. Considering therefore that God is wise and wonderfull in his working; let us apply ourselves to him, and in due time wee shall see the fruite and benefit of all his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations.</p>
                  <p>I should now have come to the third and last proposition, and that was, That this profit that God aymeth at in all his castigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his children, is to make them partaker of his holinesse. And this is profit indeede, when God thereby draweth us from the world, and makes us more heavenly minded, and more dead to the creature, purgeth away our drosse, and takes away that filth and corruption that is in us; oh this will I quit all the cost, and make amends for all the labour and paines and hardship wee have beene made to endure. But I shall forbeare to insist upon this.</p>
                  <p>So much for the Text.</p>
                  <p>There is a word to be spoken according to custome with respect to the occasion of our meeting. I have done the maine part of my taske, which was to present to you a word of instruction; and therefore for the occasion concerning this young gentleman dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased,
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:14764:303"/>
whose Funeralls wee now solemnize, I shall but speake a few words and so conclude.</p>
                  <p>I neede not to speake any thing concerning his parentage and discent; nor much concerning his education, I am confident that that was religious and gracious, and such as wherein there was a second travell in order to his spirituall birth, <hi>that Iesus Christ might be formed in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For his owne particular, though I can speake nothing upon my owne knowledge (being a meere stranger) yet I have such a testimony concerning him, from those that deserve cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence both of me and you, as that I shall conclude that of him, as may give us good hope concerning his finall and eternall estate.</p>
                  <p>If so be contrition of heart and sorrow for sinne?

If so be the due respect to the Lords day, the desire of promoting the sanctifying of it both by himselfe and others, with a continuall griefe proceeding from a sense of his owne disabilitie to answer to the occasions and duties of the day. If there bee any thing to bee concluded of concerning Religion, from such passages as these; then (brethren) I have all these as so many materialls put into my hand to builde withall, and so to reare up a testimony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you concerning this disceased.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the 33. verse of the former Chapter, our Saviour Christ told his Disciples, that he must now goe away from them; <hi>Little children, yet a little while I am with you, and you shall seeke mee, and as I said to the Iewes, whither I goe you cannot come, so say I now to you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This message of the departure of Christ from the earth, of his being tooke from them, did exceedingly sad their hearts, and very much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex, and disquiet their spirits; they knew what a comfort they had in the presence of Christ; they knew what a faithfull Teacher hee was, what a mightie Protector hee had beene, how gracious and full of heavenly comfort hee had manifested himselfe to them at all times in his being with them; And they could not now thinke of parring with him, without much perplexitie, and
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:14764:306"/>
disquiet, and trouble of spirit. Therefore the words that I have now read, are the speech of our blessed Saviour, to comfort them, <note place="margin">The summe of the words.</note> strengthening their hearts against those disquiets under which they were exercised;</p>
                  <p>In which words you may briefly observe these three things, <note place="margin">Division.</note> for time will not suffer mee to stand much upon them.</p>
                  <p>First, a dutie whereunto they are exhorted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the meanes whereby it may be performed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the letts that were to bee removed, that hindered them in the performance of the dutie in the use of these meanes.</p>
                  <p>The dutie that is to bee performed, is in the beginning of the first verse, <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The meanes whereby to performe it, in the words following, <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>You beleeve in God, beleeve also in me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The letts and impediments of the performance of it in the use <note place="margin">3.</note> of these meanes, are so many objections and doubts, as are wisely prevented by the wisedome of God, in the two verses following.</p>
                  <p>I shall take them as I come to them in order, and but give a briefe touch upon every one of of them.</p>
                  <p>First, the dutie that is to be performed, it is this, to stablish and comfort their hearts, <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word that is here translated, <hi>trouble,</hi> it signifieth such a <note place="margin">Explication</note> trouble as is in water, when the mudde is stirred up, or when the waves and surges are raised by some tempest or storme; It signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth such a trouble as is in an Army, when the Souldiers are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranked, and routed, when they are disordered, and it shewes thus much, that those distempers that are in the hearts of men, in the affections of men, doe exceedingly hinder their judgements, that they can see no more, nor discerne things no better, then a man can doe in a muddie water. All the affections are as so many Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in an Armie disordered, that keepe not their due subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their leader and guide, by reason that the understanding that should guide the will and affections, is now made a servant to them.</p>
                  <p>And this distemper of spirit ariseth from the inordinacie of the affections, the inordinate motion, and agitation of them.</p>
                  <p>This is called <hi>trouble, Let not your hearts be troubled;</hi> Bee not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed thus, and disquieted, and disordered; So that no facultie of the soule can performe its owne worke; So as that it is disabled to judge of things according to truth, but that you are mis-led, and deluded by mists and appearances.</p>
                  <p>It is with the mind in sorrow, as it is with the eye in teares, that cannot see a thing clearely, so the mind cannot judge of <note place="margin">Simile.</note> things distinctly, when the soule is disturbed; <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="593" facs="tcp:14764:306"/>
But that which our Saviour aymes at here, hath a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the affections of feare, and griefe, when these are in the excesse, the mind is troubled, when a man over-feares any thing, or over-gries any thing, hee is troubled and disquieted; <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled;</hi> that is, grieve not for things more then they are to be grieved for, and feare not things more then they are to be feared. For all these will dis-joynt the soule (as it were) it will put the spirit to much paine and disquit, as a bone out of joynt; Therefore by all meanes keepe your hearts in a right state, in that order that God hath set them; <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That, that I will briefly note here, shall be but thus much, that</p>
                  <p>Men are wondrous prone, even the very best men, to be disturbed in <note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> their passions and affections.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour Christ speakes it here to his Disciples, to those that he had taught, before whom hee had gone, as an excellent example all his dayes, yet these holy men, these followers of Christ, that had followed him through so many dangers, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so many teachings, and instructings of them; hee had need to call upon them, to stirre them up to consider of their owne estate, that <hi>their hearts might not bee troubled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may see the Maladie in the Medicine. Every prohibition in the word supposeth a corruption, and an aptnesse in the naturall heart and spirit of man, to sinne, and transgresse in that particular; Therefore when Christ speakes to his Disciples, and tells them they should not be troubled. It shewes, that even the best men, are subject to excesse of passion, and affection, to be disturbed, and troubled, through immoderate feare, or griefe, for that was the case of the Disciples.</p>
                  <p>Now briefly I will shew the grounds of it, and come to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, because I will hasten.</p>
                  <p>This trouble that is upon the spirits sometimes of the best men, it ariseth,</p>
                  <p>Partly from Gods providence, and hand upon them.</p>
                  <p>And partly from Sathan.</p>
                  <p>And partly from themselves.</p>
                  <p>I will shew you the causes in these in particulars, and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie <note place="margin">Ground:</note> it.</p>
                  <p>First, it riseth many times from the hand of God. The Lord <note place="margin">1. From God. Psal. 84.</note> is said <hi>to bee a Sunne, and a shield;</hi> The Lord will be knowne to bee a Sunne, and a shield to his people.</p>
                  <p>Now, looke as it is with the earth when the Sunne withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his light, it is all darke and cold, and dead; So it is with the hearts of the best men, when God withdrawes the light of his countenance from the soule, it is as the earth at midnight. And
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:14764:307"/>
as it is with Souldiers in the battell, if their shields be taken from them, they are exposed to every dart, and danger; every thing may annoy them, and wound them. So it is in the state of the soule; if God withdraw himselfe from it, and doe not now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it as before, and doe not fence, and strengthen it as at other times, the fierie darts of Sathan will pierce deepe into the soule, and the spirit will not bee able to uphold it selfe against these assaults.</p>
                  <p>Now God withdrawes himselfe sometimes from his servants, <note place="margin">Why God withdrawes the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from his people.</note> and that in speciall wisedome. In respect either of the time <list>
                        <item>past.</item>
                        <item>present.</item>
                        <item>to come.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes God doth it in respect of the time past, and so hee doth it by way of correction. First, to correct his children for <note place="margin">1. For correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their former abuse of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</note> their former wantonnesse, they have abused the expressions of love, and now as a Father takes away the light from his child, when hee sees hee makes no better use of it then to play with it. So God sometimes takes away the light of his countenance; that is, he casts cloudes before himselfe, he doth not manifest himselfe in that loving favour, when his servants neglect that reverence and feare that hee expects from them in the midst of his mercies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this hee doth sometimes as a correction of their <note place="margin">2. Of the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of their dutie.</note> negligence, when God hath called on them from time to time, and they have neglected calling on God; hee hath called upon them for dutie, and for the leaving of such particular evils, and they have neglected it. Now God withdrawes himselfe, to make them know what it is to doe so; And because they will not know what it is to heare his voyce, when hee calls, hee will make them feele it, by his not hearing their voyce when they pray.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes hee calls to them, as hee did to the Church in the <note place="margin">Cant. 5.</note> Canticles; <hi>Open to mee my sister, my Spouse, my love,</hi> &amp;c. The Church is negligent and carelesse; <hi>I have put off my cloathes, how shall I put them on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?</hi> Now hee withdrawes himselfe from the soule, and what is the end of it? <hi>The Keepers strike her, and the watch-men take away her vaile;</hi> and now shee is left to trouble and perplexitie, because Christ had absented himselfe, whom shee would not entertaine, when hee offered himselfe; Thus God doth, to correct that, that is past.</p>
                  <p>And farther, God doth it sometimes to correct that carnall confidence, and securitie whereunto men are wondrous prone, <note place="margin">3. Of their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall securitie.</note> when they goe on in a cleare way with much comfort, with wind and tide. <hi>I said in my prosperitie</hi> (saith <hi>David) I shall never bee
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:14764:307"/>
mooved, thou Lord hast made my mountain so strong;</hi> but what followeth upon it? saith he, <hi>Lord thou hidest thy face, and I was troubled,</hi> now trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble came upon him, trouble of Spirit, because he rested too much in that outward mountaine, in that outward condition whereunto God had exalted him, and he placed his hope too much on this, and thought it should be alwaies thus, now God turnes his hand &amp; then <hi>David</hi> is troubled: and that is the first particular in the first cause.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, God hath a further ayme, and that is for the time present and that is.</p>
                  <p>First, to informe all his servants where their strength lies, where <note place="margin">2. To teach them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent comfort and happines consists.</note> all their good lies, it lies not in themselves, it lies not in any creature: And therefore God will have them seeke it in him, &amp; that they may do it, he drawes them to it by sence, they shall be deprived of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in respect sometime of outward conveniences, and in respect sometime of the light of his countenance shining upon their soules.</p>
                  <p>How doe wee know that the Moone shines on the earth by a <note place="margin">Simile.</note> borrowed light? but because wee see it is not alwayes alike in its light, we see sometimes it hath a full light, and sometimes it is enlightned but by the halfe, and sometimes by some little part, where wee see this disproportion that it is not alwayes alike, wee know by this that the light of the Moone is borrowed from some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what else, from the Sunne.</p>
                  <p>Now how doe wee know that the heart of man is fed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, and supported with comfort from without it selfe, with borrowed and received comfort? but by this; Because the state of Gods servants in respect of the spirituall quiet, and satisfaction and contentment of heart is not alwayes alike, but sometimes they have aboundance of joy, that they seeme to bee (as it were) in heaven. Sometimes they are perplexed with many disquiets and griefes, that they seeme to be <hi>cast downe to the deepe,</hi> as it is said of the Marriners in <hi>Psal.</hi> 107. what is the reason of this? but <hi>that no flesh should glory in it selfe;</hi> that every man might know that whatsoever he hath to make his life comfortable, and pleasing to him it is from God that dispenseth it to men in that proportion as seemeth good to his owne wisedome.</p>
                  <p>God will have us know that all the happinesse of our spirits is in their union with the chiefe of spirits, with himselfe; and that when they are but a little separated from him, when he doth but a little withdraw himselfe from them, they are as a thing that is dead; how shall wee know that the branches have sappe from the roote, that it is that that makes them flourish and grow? but by this: If you doe but cut them off from the roote they wither presently. So it is with the spirit, with the heart of man; if God doe but a little withdraw himselfe, let sinne but make a separation betweene God and man, now a man is like a withered branch, he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:14764:308"/>
now to revive him, because hee is divided from the roote: At the least it is with him as it is with a tree in Winter, though the sappe remaines in the roote, so though hee remaine in union with the roote, yet the moysture is gotten into the roote it selfe, and doth not now infuse it selfe into the branches; I confesse the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God that is once united to Christ shall never be separated, the union it is now, and alwayes shall bee, but never the lesse, the sappe and comfort of the Spirit, it may remaine in the head, <hi>our life</hi> may be <hi>hid in Christ,</hi> and may not appeare in us at all; And we are then in that estate as if wee were branches cut off, whereby it may appeare, that whatsoever life and comfort, and strength of heart we had, it was from Christ, and by the influence and worke of his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>And then for the time to come, God doth it to prevent some distempers that might growe on the hearts of his servants if they <note place="margin">3. For proven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> should alwayes be in a like state of spirituall joy. God doth it to prevent pride, <hi>Paul</hi> was apt to bee <hi>lift up with those revelations,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Of pride.</note> therefore <hi>a messenger of Sathan was sent to buffet him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And so it may be to prevent carnall confidence in the creature, a man would begin to ascribe somewhat to himselfe, to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <note place="margin">2. Of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the creature or in the habits of grace. 2 Cor. 1. 10.</note> condition, if it were alwayes thus with him, you know what the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 10. We received in our selves the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death that wee might not trust in our selves, but in God that ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the dead,</hi> looke to what end <hi>Paul</hi> received the sentence of death, to that end Gods faithfull servants sometimes receive the very sence of death (as it were) and the sence of the destitution, and want of all spirituall comforts for the present; Why? That they <hi>might not trust in themselves,</hi> or in those habits of grace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts they have, or in any creature whatsoever. The worke of Gods spirit in the regenerate soule, it is but a creature, a worke of God, and God will not have men trust in any such thing, in what then? <hi>In him that rayseth from the dead;</hi> God will bring them to such a state, that they shall seeme as dead men, as destitute of all spirituall comforts they have, that they might trust in him that is able to rayse them out of such a state as that, that looke as hee is able to give life to the dead body, so he is able to give comfort to the distressed soule, that is at that time, <hi>in the shaddow of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it comes sometimes from Sathan, and that is thus, <note place="margin">Ground.</note> Sathan wonderfully sets himselfe against <hi>the seede of the woman,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. From Sathan.</note> especially against the promised seede, <hi>Christ,</hi> he will alway bee at his heele, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 16. and in his opposition against Christ, hee sets against the very glory of Christ among men, and that is his kingdome, hee would not have Christ exalt his kingdome over men.</p>
                  <p>Now the kingdome of Christ consists as the Apostle speakes,
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:14764:308"/>
                     <hi>not in meate and drinke but in righteousnesse and peace, and joy in the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> If he cannot keepe a Christian, a true beleever, from unrighteousnesse, he will labour to interrupt his peace: if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keepe him from the habit of peace, peace in the grounds of it, yet hee will keepe him from the exercise and effects of that peace, from joy, he will hinder that as much as he can, that hee may not have the sence of his blessednesse: he knowes that spirituall joy strengthens a man to all spirituall duties; and his endeavour is to weaken all the servants of Christ, in all their services; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth, at least labour against that with all his might, that if they will needes goe on, yet neverthelesse to propound, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion as many things that may be troublesome to them, and disquiet their hearts as he can.</p>
                  <p>And there are two principall wayes (that I may but touch them) <note place="margin">How Sathan causeth trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the hearts of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</note> whereby Sathan wondrously prevailes in this particular.</p>
                  <p>The one is by stealing out of their hearts those precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, those comforts, whereby the Word of God revives the soule. <hi>You have forgotten</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>the consolations of God.</hi> And the <note place="margin">1. By stealing out of their hearts the promises of the Gospel. Heb. 12.</note> divell meets in man with two advantages, to helpe him in the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of this; First he turnes the thoughts upon new objects, and herein hee doth diametricall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, and directly set himselfe against God in the way of his speciall providence: that very thing that God in wonderfull wisedome hath wrought in the heart for the ease and comfort of man, Sathan makes it an occasion of trouble, and that is this, the varietie of mans thoughts; what is the reason that God hath framed the minde of man to change his thoughts continually, and to have innumerable thoughts? Certainly for the very ease of the Spirit of man, for the very ease of the soule of man: For if the minde should keepe intent upon any one thought long, it would so worke upon that, that it would weary it selfe out in working, as wee see men by excesse of griefe in particular cases, grow to be phrensie, and distracted, and the like: Now this aptnesse of the minde to runne to varietie of thoughts that God hath made for the ease of man, Sathan turnes it as a helpe to hurt him. A man shall runne on into a world of businesse, of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and distractions that shall draw him from the thought of those things that hee hath heard for the relieving of his Spirit wherein God spake comfort to his heart, that hee may the better fasten those discouragements on him, that he desires.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another advantage he hath for this end is this, that is, hee wondrously prevailes upon the heart of man by a carelesse neglect that is in men: every man loves ease; There is such a spirit in man, such a disposition in the spirit of man, that he avoydes the things ordinarily that have great labour: this disposition to case, and rest, Sathan serves himselfe on, and makes great use of; so
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:14764:309"/>
when a man hath come from hearing the Word, and reading the Scriptures, whereas he should now bee exercised, and labour in meditation to worke those things on his heart that now the roote might fasten, and things might settle on the soule, hee passeth by these easily, now the heart of a man lies open as the high way, you know the parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. when <hi>the seede fell on the high-way,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>the Foules of the ayre came,</hi> and picked it up, and it was gone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, where there is no paines taken with the heart of a man, as there is none taken with the high way, that the seed that falls there might grow, as in the plowed ground, when there is no paines ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the heart, now every notion, every direction, and every spirituall instruction it lies lightly there, and is soone carried out, this is the advantage that Sathan makes of a mans love of ease.</p>
                  <p>But there is another thing concerning the way that Sathan takes, not only to steale it out of the mind by those two wayes, <note place="margin">2. By presenting to the soule the truths of God in false glosses.</note> but againe by presenting the very truths of God to men in false glosses, so as a man cannot discerne them in their owne shape, and nature, but in such coulours as hee presents them to them. If the time would have served, I might instance in severall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; I will but touch upon one or two, and leave the inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to your owne meditations. Sometimes, things that are great, and of precious use, shall be presented small, and of no account: and things againe that are small and little, shall be presented won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous great: The mercies of God, the Attributes of God, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the Gospell, the sufficiencie of the merits of Christ, these shall seeme small things, little to be regarded, lesse then ever God intended them to be: And on the contrary, a mans owne sinnes, his owne distempers shall bee made exceeding great: Worldly things shall be presented, as things of the greatest consequence; and spirituall things as meere accessories, as things that depend upon them, and that come in after. Sometimes againe, things that are most necessarie to be understood and knowne, things that should be particularly applyed, shall be presented obscurely and confusedly; and sometimes things of lesser consequence, the knowledge whereof is not so necessary, shall bee presented with more clearenesse, and with strong perswasions to the study and knowledge of them. But I will not stand on this: this is enough to give you a tast of Sathans subtiltie this way, whereby he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drously prevailes in bringing trouble upon the spirits of men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is from our selves, and so it comes to passe from <note place="margin">Ground.</note> that generall corruption that is in our natures, from whence all <note place="margin">3. From our selves.</note> other sinnes flow, that the spirits of men are troubled, and distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, by things that fall out from day to day.</p>
                  <p>And first it comes to passe, that the soule of man is miserablie <note place="margin">1.</note> in bondage, and captivated, and inthralled, and is deprived of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:14764:309"/>
(as it were) through the distemper of the body; as in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie <note place="margin">From some distemper of the body.</note> and sicknesse, wee see how the soule is disturbed by the very diseases, and distempers in the body it selfe, and that by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that simpathie in the soule with the body, it riseth from the union of it, to the body by the spirits: but this I will passe by.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes we see the soule subdued with lusts and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">2. Prevailing of some strong lust.</note> some strong lust, some strong sinne or other prevailes; And then as it is with the fowle that is now flying in the ayre, it may be there is bird-lime cast upon the wings of it, it falls downe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, and can flie no further; so it is with the soule, somewhat presseth it downe, somewhat compasseth it about, and coupes it in, as that expression is used, <hi>Heb. 12. 1. Let us cast off the sinne that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>compasseth us about, and that presseth so heavy downe, that we may runne with patience the race that is set before us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And sometimes the soule is disturbed by inordinate passions, which arise from that generall distemper that is diffused through <note place="margin">3 Inordinate passions.</note> every facultie, and so the understanding lookes upon things as through a mist, it sees nothing clearely, and in most common things it is blind, and it is led by blind affections too, and <hi>when the blind lead the blind, both fall into the ditch,</hi> saith Christ: and so the memorie that should reteine the precious treasures, the promises of the Gospell to relieve the soule in all cases, it is like a leaking vessell that lets things runne out, as it is <hi>Heb. 2. Take heed that the things you have heard, runne not out,</hi> saith the Apostle, alluding to <note place="margin">Heb. 2.</note> that Metaphor.</p>
                  <p>And the very conscience it selfe that should bee conclusive, it now rests in generalls and uncertainties, conscience should deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what my case is, whether I bee the child of God, or no; whether I be in the state of grace or no, to put a man to bring things to particular: now for the most part by mans owne neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it remaines in doubt, it may bee I am, it may bee I am not, it may be I have a right in the Covenant of grace, it may be not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now because conscience is not come to that resolute conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive act that a man may determine of his owne particular case, hence it is that every thing troubles, and disquiets him. Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved you see the reasons of it.</p>
                  <p>Wee will briefly passe it over with a word of Application;</p>
                  <p>And first it should teach us compassion towards those whose <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. To teach us compassion towards those that are in trouble.</note> spirits are troubled, our Saviour Christ saith here, <hi>Let not you hearts bee troubled;</hi> Hee considered of them in their weaknesse, and doth not much upbraid them with it, but helpes to bring them out of it in much mercie, and love, and so should wee. There is such a disposition rising from the pride, crueltie, and uncharitablenesse of the hearts of men, that they are apt to adde to the burthen of the afflicted, and to make their afflictions more by their sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:14764:310"/>
of their troubles. You know the speech of old <hi>Ely</hi> a good man, but yet hee failed in that, when hee saw <hi>Hannah</hi> in great trouble of spirit, uttering her heart before the Lord; <hi>Lay away thy drunkennesse,</hi> (saith hee) hee thought shee was drunke, at least with some passion, and all came but from perplexitie, and distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of spirit, and in that manner hee rather added to her griefe then eased her; So <hi>Iobs</hi> friends you see what they said, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently judged him in that case, as one that God had cast off for hypocrisie, and for his pride, and covetousnesse, or for some one thing or other, and therefore it was thus with him; Nay, Christ himselfe, the censure of all men was thus much concerning Christ himselfe; <hi>Wee did esteeme him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isay 53 4.</note> The intent of the phrase is, as one smitten for his owne ill, as if God had now manifested that hee did not acknowledge him to be so holy and righteous. So thus you see the inclination in the heart of man, to uncharitable judging of those that God hath cast downe, and suffers to bee exercised under many afflictions, and troubles; Let us learne then spirituall wisedome; let us learne love, and spirituall mercie, to judge more favourably of the state of those whom wee see troubled in spirit.</p>
                  <p>Many times God infeebleth, and distresseth the spirits of his best servants, to abate the pride of men, that none might exalt himselfe before God; Nay, in the very thing wherein they have excelled, in the same thing hee sometimes abaseth them: you see <hi>Abraham</hi> he is called the <hi>Father of the faithfull;</hi> his excellencie was his faith, yet faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> is detected in Scripture of much unbeliefe in some particulars; Who would thinke that hee should expose <hi>Sara,</hi> as he did to save himselfe? that he should doe it, that was called the Father of the faithfull? you have heard (saith the Apostle <hi>Iames) of the patience of Iob,</hi> the very excellencie of <hi>Iob</hi> was his patience: who would thinke that ever patient <hi>Iob</hi> should utter such things as hee did, sometime, even cursing the very day of his birth? <hi>David</hi> a man of a cheerefull spirit, a man full of the praises of God, a man wondrous large, when hee comes to speake of the glory of God at severall times. A man would have thought him of an invincible fortitude, and courage, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse you shall have <hi>David</hi> so cast downe, as that hee thinkes the Lord had forgotten him, and that the Lord would shew no mercy upon him, that the Lord had hid himselfe from him, and that hee would never regard him more; who would thinke that ever <hi>David,</hi> that abounded so in the comforts of the spirit sometimes, should bee so dejected at such times as those were, when he was in such a conflict? <note place="margin">God suffers his servants to be in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward distresse and why.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why doth God doe this?</p>
                  <p>To shew thus much, that the very best of his servants in the
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:14764:310"/>
chiefe of their excellencies are dependant on him still, they have nothing of themselves, or from themselves. Therefore they shall sometimes seeme to want that they have, that the very having, and using of it, may be ascribed to his glory. Then let us now reason thus, when wee see the servants of God in trouble, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed under disquiet; Let us conclude, now God is glorifying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. This the Apostle inferres, <hi>Hee will rejoyce in his infirmities, because the power of Christ is manifested by it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For our selves, it should teach us (according to the intent of this place) above all things to labour, that our hearts may bee kept in that blessed plight of spirituall joy, that we may be streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with freenesse of heart to serve God in our inward man; <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How should this be done?</p>
                  <p>The Text tells us here (and so I come briefly to the second thing observable in the Text, the means) <hi>you believe in God</hi> (saith he) <hi>beleeve also in mee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the words are read in the translation, they seeme to be utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by way of concession, as much as if Christ had said, since you already beleeve in God, now beleeve in mee. The <hi>Syriack</hi> seemes to expresse it otherwise, and so render it by way of command, and to make here an intimation of two duties, as a helpe of quieting the heart, and so it reades it; <hi>Let not your hearts bee troubled, beleeve in God, beleeve also in mee,</hi> propounding a twofold object, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about faith should be exercised, that the heart may bee quieted in the time of any trouble.</p>
                  <p>The first is God, considered in the Trinitie of persons, in the unitie of Essence.</p>
                  <p>The second is Christ, Mediator, God, and Man.</p>
                  <p>Now, saith he, beleeve in God, that is the first, rest upon God.</p>
                  <p>Then the second is, <hi>beleeve in mee also;</hi> as one that is the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour betweene God and you, now making your peace with God; So the second part seemes to be the prevention of an objection; For when he saith, <hi>Let not your hearts bee troubled, beleeve in God,</hi> they might say, Alas, shall wee beleeve in God, that are sinfull men; <hi>The sinners in Sion cry out, Who shall dwell with consuming fire?</hi> &amp;c. Therefore saith Christ, <hi>beleeve also in mee;</hi> that is, know that God will bee your God, in, and for my sake he is reconciled, and well pleased with you. Therefore in all your approaches to God, take me with you, looke up to God, pray to him, depend upon God through mee still, keepe mee as a Mediatour betweene God and you, and this will preserve your hearts in peace. The time would not serve, if I should goe over things particularly, and in a full way; Therefore I will touch the heads of things, and it shall be thus much, that</p>

                     <pb n="602" facs="tcp:14764:311"/>A speciall meanes to preserve the heart of man from excessive sorrow, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Faith is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall meanes to quiet the soule.</note> and feare, from trouble, and disquiet of spirit, is faith.</p>
                  <p>Let not your hearts be troubled; But how shall wee helpe it? <hi>Beleeve in God, beleeve also in mee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this wee shall see through the Scriptures, <hi>David</hi> found it thus, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. hee speakes to his disquieted soule; <hi>Trust in God, I will waite on him, hee is my God. Iehoshaphat</hi> in that excellent speech <note place="margin">Psal. 40. 2 Chro 20. 20</note> to his Souldiers, that were now troubled, for the multitude of their enemies against them; <hi>Beleeve in God, and you shall prosper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve his Prophets, and you shall be established;</hi> that is the way to sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the heart, to beleeve in God, revealing himselfe in his Word. It is noted of <hi>Moses,</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 27. Hee therefore <hi>indured</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 27.</note> all that he did, because <hi>hee looked on him that is invisible.</hi> And those three companions of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 3. <hi>Our God</hi> (say they) <hi>whom wee</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>serve is able to helpe us, but if hee will not, wee will not worship thy gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Image.</hi> There was matter of trouble, and disquiet in the heart to be put to such a plunge, that they must either worship, or bee cast into the Furnace, heated seven times hotter; Well, this eased them of all trouble, and disquiet; <hi>they know whom they had trusted, and bee was able to keepe that, that was committed to him, to the comming</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>of Christ.</hi> As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expresseth it, with which hee also rested abundantly satisfied.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, the want of this, hath beene the cause of that perplexitie, and disquiet that hath beene upon the hearts of Gods servants at all times. That was the reason that <hi>Abraham</hi> was so disturbed, and disquieted, in that feare of what should be done to him in Egypt, certainly he failed in this, in resting upon God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> was wondrously troubled, when the Lord bad him goe to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and deliver <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> (saith he) <hi>Lord, send by him whom thou shouldest send, I am a man of a stammering tongue,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>I will be with thy tongue;</hi> Hee bids him quiet his heart in that perplexitie, and rest on him that made the tongue, to be with his tongue; And because there was another secret that troubled him, the Lord knew his heart, God saith, goe, <hi>the man that sought thy life is dead;</hi> as if hee should say, <hi>Moses,</hi> though thou wilt not confesse it, I know what troubleth thee, thou art afraid that the men that sought thy life are alive in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, and that therfore when thou commest thither, thou shalt be executed. No, saith he, they are dead; hee would have him rest on him, and that would revive his heart, that he should not bee troubled and disquieted. So you may see in other servants of God, that this was alwayes the reason of any indirect course they tooke? <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Rebecca,</hi> in that case; why did <hi>Rebecca</hi> use that devise in getting the blessing with <hi>Iacob?</hi> Because shee failed in her trust in God, shee
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:14764:311"/>
saw how shee was perplexed with the daughters of <hi>Heth, Esaus</hi> wives, and many troubles that way; And <hi>Isaac</hi> was dim-sighted, and had many weaknesses upon him, she knew not how he might mistake, and give the blessing to the other, therefore shee deviseth a way to get the blessing, but shee got many sorrowes; you know what a hard service it cost <hi>Iacob,</hi> and how many evils it exposed him too, and all was, because through feare, and disquiet of heart, he cast not himselfe upon God in his way, but they would find out wayes of their owne.</p>
                  <p>It should teach us in all disquiet of spirit, to looke principally <note place="margin">Vse.</note> to the strengthening of our faith. This is called a <hi>shield,</hi> Eph. 6. <note place="margin">Eph. 6.</note> when all the darts of temptation that fire the soule, and perplexe it many wayes, are cast upon a man; here is a shield to preserve and keepe him safe. Therefore let us ever have this for our use whole and sound. You shall find that even the servants of God have so farre beene in a comfortable estate, as they have beene in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of their faith.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>David</hi> for an example, when <hi>Ziglag</hi> was burnt, and his Wives, and servants, and goods, and cattell, were all carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the Souldiers in the rage of their hearts, and discontent, began to thinke of stoning of him, yet saith the Text; <hi>Then David comforted himselfe in the Lord his God;</hi> When there was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in his Souldiers about him, or in those that were neere him, every thing was taken away, at this time <hi>David</hi> comforts himselfe in the Lord his God. So <hi>Iob,</hi> see how quiet his heart is, and well satisfied, when hee rested on God, in the greatest occasions and troubles, his goods were carried away, his sonnes were slaine, all added to <hi>Iobs</hi> miserie, but he comes to this; <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed bee the Lord,</hi> when he can looke above the creature to God, and settle his heart upon this rocke, he findes comfort in it.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, the servants of God are never out of trouble, and disquiet when they neglect this, as the Disciples in the tempest upon the Sea, <hi>Math.</hi> 8. they crie out they are utterly undone; <hi>Save Master:</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Oh yee of little faith!</hi> The not exercising of their faith did so perplexe, and disquiet them as it did, and if you looke upon all the complaints of the lives of men, for the losse of such friends, and the decay of trading, for the ill dealing of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomers, for sicknesse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Men are alway complaining. What is the reason? Because they place too much hope and confidence in the creature; they looke not above these things with the eye of faith, and hence comes that disturbance, and disquiet, if the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes be taken from them, they looke not upon that God that hath all meanes and opportunities in his owne hand.
<q>You beleeve in God, beleeve also in mee.</q>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="604" facs="tcp:14764:312"/>They that would have their hearts quiet by beleeving in God <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. Faith that quiets the soule, must be pitched upon God in Christ.</note> should especially exercise faith in resting on Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beleeve in mee,</hi> saith Christ, for the heart of man flies off from God; Alas, the Lord is holy, and I am a sinfull man, hee is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and I am sinfull, who shall come before this holy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God? Now when faith can looke upon Christ, and set him betweene God and me, and looke on God through him, now the soule rests, hee lookes on God as a Father through Christ his Sonne; when the soule lookes on Christ, as my husband married to mee, as my head, and I am united to him as a member, as my Lord that hath taken me into his protection, when the soule thus lookes on Christ, now it lookes upon God in all his attributes, wondrousglorious, and comfortable to the soule. This is the thing that I can but touch at this time; There are two things consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in it.</p>
                  <p>First, there is no ground of reposing the soule upon God, but by beleeving in Christ, he is the Mediatour. Therefore in <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 24. saith Christ, <hi>Except you beleeve, that I am hee whom the Father</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">John 8. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>sent, you shall die in your sinnes.</hi> The <hi>Iewes,</hi> they did beleeve in God, they were the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and worshipped the God of their Fathers, and beleeved in God; but, saith he, except you beleeve in me, that I am he that God hath sent as Mediatour; <hi>you shall die in your sinnes.</hi> And so in this Chapter; <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man commeth to the Father, but by mee;</hi> there is no other way to the Father. That as the high Priest under the law was <hi>in all things pertaining to God,</hi> hee was betweene God and the people. So Christ our great high Priest is in all things that concerne the glory of God, and the salvation of man, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of a sinner, in all things betweene God and us; Here is the first thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is worth our consideration, how Christ comes to be thus, he was willing to die, a cursed, a shamefull, and cruell death of the Crosse, and to be despised and abased, and all this for man, and yet Christ crucified is despised, and scorned in the world, therefore if ever you will have acceptance of God, <hi>beleeve in mee, [In mee,]</hi> that am now going from you, that am to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by a cursed ignominious death: Here is another truth then,</p>
                  <p>They that beleeve in Christ, must beleeve in Christ abased, and crucified <note place="margin">Doct. 4.</note> as well as in Christ in glorie.</p>
                  <p>That is a thing that flesh and bloud despiseth, indeed all the world speakes well of the profession of the faith, and beleeving
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:14764:312"/>
in Christ, when Christ is in triumph, <hi>conquering to conquer,</hi> every man glories in Christians, but when Christianitie and profession is cryed downe in the world, when Christ is crucified, when all the world speakes ill of the wayes of Christ, and of <hi>the obedience of Faith,</hi> now to obey a crucified, scorned despised Christ in the sight of the world, to rest on him in the midst of his abasement this will comfort the heart of a man in the times of the greatest trouble, there is great reason it should be thus.</p>
                  <p>For Christ is the almightie glorious God in the middest of his abasement, his divinitie was not a whit abated nor his divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies diminished by all his sufferings; you see Christ in the dayes of his flesh, he cast divells out of men, and they obeyed him; <hi>The divells were subject unto him,</hi> when he conversed among men in the body; nay on the Crosse he saved the Thiefe that confessed him in the sight of all his enemies, when he was a crucified Christ, at that instant he triumphed on the very crosse, and saved a sinner that beleeved at that time, to shew that he was as mightie on the Crosse as he is now at the right hand of the Father.</p>
                  <p>Now I say, is not Christs glory a whit diminished in his abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? why should our beleefe bee abated for all the scorne and despite of the world that is cast upon the profession of the faith of Christ?</p>
                  <p>Now briefly some application of this, and so to take in the rest without amplification, because the time is past.</p>
                  <p>It should teach us in all disquiet, to know what course is to bee <note place="margin">Vse.</note> taken, every one will say I rest upon God, there is sufficient in him to make me happy, But how shall I come to have interest in God? <hi>The well is deepe,</hi> where is the bucket? what is the meanes to relieve my soule, and to supply my wants? <hi>Beleeve in me,</hi> saith Christ, let the soule looke on Christ immediatly as the Mediator betweene God and us, this is that I should have spoken of, and a word of exhortation to the purpose.</p>
                  <p>You will say, what is it to beleeve in Christ. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quest. Answ.</hi> What it is to believe in Christ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first thing that is done in this, is receiving Christ upon Gods offer of him, God offers Christ in all his offices, as <hi>King, Priest</hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi> as a Lord and Saviour to the Church, and hee would have men take whole Christ, or no part of him. Now if the soule answer to this offer of God, he shall be my <hi>Lord</hi> to rule me, my <hi>Prophet</hi> to instruct me, my <hi>Saviour</hi> upon whom my soule shall rest for salvation, this is the answer of the soule to God, this is the receiving.</p>
                  <p>Now you must know there must be a right propounding, and a right apprehending of Christ.</p>
                  <p>You must know first what it is to receive Christ as a Prophet, as one that will instruct us in the truths that are contrarie to naturall
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:14764:313"/>
principles in the corrupt understanding of man, he will leade you now in the way of the Wildernesse, in by pathes, in crooked rough wayes, he will teach you to <hi>deny your selves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first rule that he gives, is for a man to deny himselfe, as if <note place="margin">What it is to receive Christ as a Prophet</note> he should say, that is the first worke: hee died to pull downe all the old frame, and to set it up againe; For what is the understanding of man, but a frame of false principles? for the naturall minde of man, it is nothing but a habit, a heape, a pile of false principles, that every man perisheth by the delusion of his owne understanding: now the first worke of Christ is to dissolve this frame and to blot out these rules wherby men walke when they are led by sence, and naturall reason, and observation of the world; now these must all be taken away, and a man must resolve all now into the authority of Christs speaking. A word of Christ is enough against a thousand examples in the world, and against a thousand reasons of a mans owne corrupt heart. This is to receive Christ as a Prophet, when I will not walke by the rules of my deluded reason, and corrupt minde, after which I was carried before, but the Word of Christ shall carry mee in all things, here is obedience of faith in matter of Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>And so to receive Christ as a King, would you know what a King he is? hee is a holy King, whose lawes are all right, the Law <note place="margin">As a king.</note> of Faith is a righteous Law, and <hi>the obedience of Faith</hi> must be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to righteousnesse, that is righteous obedience wherein a man labours more and more to perfit holines in the feare of God.</p>
                  <p>Hence comes all that care to mortifie corruptions, and to frame the inward man to conforme to those rules that are taught by Christ as a Prophet; the soule receiving Christ as a King gives it self to obey all the rules and directions that Christ in his Word as a Prophet hath left: and this it doth in faith, that is, looking upon his authoritie that hath commanded it; for that is properly an act of faith when things are done upon this ground, upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of him that hath revealed it, I beleeve it to bee his will, because hee hath revealed it; and it is my dutie, because it is his will; Thus the soule resolves all to Christ, as a Prophet and a King.</p>
                  <p>And then it rests on him as a Priest, and comforts it selfe in Spirit, <note place="margin">As a Priest.</note> now for a man when he wants comfort hee must not seperate the offices of Christ, and say I will rest on Christ as a Priest; these are errours and delusions. Shall a man be saved by a halfe Faith, by a peece of Faith? To looke on Christ in one office, and to thinke to bee saved onely by that without concurring, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitating in the other offices? Beloved as Christ is intire in all his offices, so the faith of a beleever is intire looking upon all his offices; therefore wee must receive him as <hi>King, Priest</hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi>
                     <pb n="607" facs="tcp:14764:313"/>
that hee may be <hi>wisedome, righteousnesse, sanctification, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that he may bee all to the beleeving soule, for present, and for future happinesse, else if Christ bee not all, he will be nothing, men must not please themselves to looke upon one office of Christ, and to neglect all the rest.</p>
                  <p>When this is done come to the maine matter, the soule is bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten off; as when a man is in a Boate getting to land after ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, there comes a storme and beats him backe againe when he thinkes hee is even at the shore, but still hee takes hold on the Boate and keepes his eye upon the shore: So the soule when it comes to this to be beate off againe, still it keepes the shore in its sight, and directs it selfe towards Christ, that should bee the end and ayme of all a mans indeavours, the true object of faith, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you consider this point.</p>
                  <p>But a man will say, though I be carefull to receive him (I speake <note place="margin">Quest.</note> of weake Christians, or of strong Christians that are weakened by temptations) Alas what hope have I in Christ, Christ is in heaven, and I am upon the earth?</p>
                  <p>Did Christ when he was upon the earth, so tender the trouble <note place="margin">Answ.</note> of his servants at that time, as that when hee himselfe was to suffer, yet he tooke care to comfort them, <hi>be not you troubled but beleeve in me;</hi> As if hee should say, though I bee exposed to a world of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and at this time <hi>my soule is heavy unto death,</hi> yet <hi>be not troubled:</hi> was he so carefull when he was in his owne troubles on earth to comfort them? and will he not now be so in heaven, when hee is in blessednesse? certainly the soule that hath recourse to Christ shall not returne emptie; therefore see how Christ is exprest in heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>Come yee blessed, &amp;c. for what you have done to these you have done to me,</hi> hee is in heaven; and so <hi>Saul, why dost thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute me?</hi> hee is in heaven, yet in respect of his Church hee is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; therefore be assured that Christ hath not put off the bowels of love to his people, he will bee the same if thou receive him as a Lord and Saviour as ever he was to his Disciples.</p>
                  <p>But it may be objected, wee are exposed to many uncertainties <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> though wee beleeve in Christ, and wee finde not the comfort of it here.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Christ saith, rest not upon things present, here you are in Tents, but you shall come to your fathers house, there is <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                     <hi>a place provided for you,</hi> betweene which and this there is as much difference as is betweene a House and a Tent, betweene a mans owne <hi>mansion</hi> and an Inne. And though you have hard entertainement in the world, yet you shall have an abiding place after.</p>
                  <p>But you will say, indeede there are <hi>mansions,</hi> but there are aboundance to receive them, what shall we doe? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="608" facs="tcp:14764:314"/>
There are <hi>many mansions,</hi> therefore looke as there are many <note place="margin">Answ.</note> children to be brought to glory, so there are many places to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them in glory, and to settle them there: wee see what a vast body the Sunne is, and the Starres are, yet they seeme but little sparkes in comparison of the heavens above us, but what is the heaven of heavens that containe all these? infinitly beyond in its owne compasse; <hi>there are many mansions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how shall we come to heaven? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saith Christ, <hi>I goe to prepare a place for you;</hi> as if he should say, all <note place="margin">Answ.</note> that I have done, is for your sakes, I die and ascend, and sit at the right hand of God for your sakes, I will come at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to bring you to glory, all that Christ doth now, as God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as Mediator betweene good and us, all is for our sake.</p>
                  <p>But when Christ is taken from us, how shall wee get thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saith he, <hi>I will come, and bring you with me,</hi> I will come in glory <note place="margin">Answ.</note> at the day of Iudgement in the clouds and inable you to meete me; and thence bring you to those heavenly <hi>mansions in my fathers house,</hi> never doubt how these things shall bee done, I will doe them all; Thus Christ would confirme their faith, there is the greatest happinesse and comfort in this, wherein he would have them setled; this should stir us up to settle our hearts, this way; But the time is past, this shall be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for this time.</p>

                        <p>By faith Abraham when he was tried, offered up his sonne Isaac, and hee that had received the promise offered up his onely begotten sonne.</p>
                     </q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Chapter doth speake in the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Faith of many of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, and <hi>Abraham</hi> among the rest is brought in, with a manifest testimony of his Faith: there be two things observable, which <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith strengthened him to act, one was to give up his Countrey, the other was to give up his Sonne: to give up his Countrey in the 8. verse, <hi>by faith Abraham when hee was called of God, to goe out in a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed, and hee went out not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether hee went.</hi> To leave our friends, our parents, to take our journey wee know not whither, to live among wee know not whom, and all this upon a bare word; this was not an easie thing, to part with good land for some good words; this was a hard matter, sence derides it, and reason contemnes it, and will not hearken to it, but Faith can see more in Gods promise, then sence can find. <hi>Abraham</hi> will leave his Countrey, when God calls him to it, but never shall lose his Inheritance by beleeving and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: no man did ever yet hazard his estate, who could part with it upon obedient tearmes.</p>
                  <p>A second thing that hee is to part with, is with his Sonne, his <note place="margin">2.</note> only sonne, his first begotten sonne, in this Act of faith; <hi>Abraham</hi>
                     <pb n="612" facs="tcp:14764:316"/>
sayles against wind and tyde, where hee breakes through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments of the world, not only of sence and reason, but of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall affection. The story in a word is this, God after many yeares patience, at length gave <hi>Abraham</hi> a sonne in his old age, he was the child of many prayers, and of many teares, the parents delight, and to <hi>Abrahams</hi> thinking an heire of life, because a child of the Promise; hee had not long spent his gray haires in a strange land, but God on a sudden calls upon <hi>Abraham</hi> to give backe his sonne, his very sonne <hi>Isaac,</hi> as we may reade in the 22 of Genesis. Now what doth <hi>Abraham</hi> doe? how doth hee behave himselfe? doth he expostulate with God? Any thing, Lord but spare my sonne <hi>Isaac.</hi> Nay, the Text saith, <hi>hee offered up his sonne;</hi> Doth hee murmure and grumble against God in this manner; Lord why dost thou single out this delight of mine? why dost thou seeme to envie this blessing of mine? <hi>No hee offered up his Isaac;</hi> as if the Text had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed <hi>Abrahams</hi> language thus; O Lord my God, what is it that thou callest for? whom is it that thou callest for? is it for my on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sonne <hi>Isaac,</hi> the sonne of my love, the sonne of thy promise, the sonne of my age? verely Lord thou shalt have him; it is true, I love him dearely well, but I love thee better; I got him by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, and I shall never lose him by obeying; if <hi>Isaac</hi> were a thousand sonnes thou shouldest have them all, though I am a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet Lord thou art a God, if I give him, he is a sacrifice accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and though I kill him, yet thou canst quicken him and raise him againe; I shall never lose my <hi>Isaac,</hi> though I part with my sonne, for thou hast said <hi>in Isaac shall thy seed bee called.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the parts of these words are two; First, we have <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> great tryall. <note place="margin">Devision of the words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, we have <hi>Abrahams</hi> acquitment.</p>
                  <p>First his tryall, <hi>Abraham was tried when hee offered up his sonne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly his acquitment, <hi>by Faith Abraham offered up his sonne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the former we may observe three particulars;</p>
                  <p>First, the person that is tryed, <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Person that tried him, God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the thing wherein hee war tried, it was no ordinary thing, it was to part with a part of himselfe, to offer up his deare sonne <hi>Isaac.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the latter part two things are observable;</p>
                  <p>First, his quickening up himselfe in his obedientiall act, <hi>hee offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up Isaac,</hi> saith the Text.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the powerfull cause which did inable <hi>Abraham</hi> to so difficult a worke; <hi>By faith Abraham when hee was tried offered up his sonne, and hee that had received the promise offered up his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten sonne,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I cannot handle all these parts by severall peeces as they
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:14764:316"/>
lye, therefore I will deliver to you the juyce and substance of all that I have to say, in two Propositions, there might bee many more collected from these words, but I will speake of no more, the first is this;</p>
                  <p>That strong and great tryals may befall strong and great Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
                  <p>The second Proposition is this;</p>
                  <p>That Faith will make a man acquit himselfe in great tryals. Now for the first.
That strong and great tryalls may befall strong and great Christians. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Strong tryals befall strong Christians.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Text cleares it in <hi>Abraham,</hi> about his sonne, his only son, a great triall, there are ten remarkable steppes in this triall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> in offering up his Sonne.</p>
                  <p>First, had it beene to part with a dutifull servant, this had been <note place="margin">1.</note> something, but to part with a Sonne, this is much more, this wee know that the relation of a servant is much lesse then that of a child.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if hee had beene to part with a faithfull friend, such a <note place="margin">2.</note> one as <hi>Ionathan</hi> was to <hi>David,</hi> this would have tried him, but to part with a tender <hi>Isaac,</hi> this is much more.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if it were an adopted sonne that he were to part with, it were not so much, but to part with a naturall sonne, one that was <note place="margin">3.</note> a part of himselfe, a part of his owne body.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if he were a sonne amongst many more, but hee must part with his only sonne, his only sonne <hi>Isaac.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, if <hi>Abraham</hi> had beene young, and might have enjoyed another sonne, it had not beene so much, but he is the only sonne <note place="margin">5.</note> of his old age.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if it were the sonne of his old age, if it had beene an <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>Ismael,</hi> this had not beene so much, but his only sonne <hi>Isaac,</hi> a child of promise, and of prayer, a child of many teares.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if it had beene a sonne wherein wee tooke no great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that his affections were not so much set upon, it had not <note place="margin">7.</note> beene so much, but it was the sonne of his love; he must not onely part with his only sonne, and the only sonne of his old age, but his only sonne whom he loved.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if it were but only to part from him, to have him ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenaway, <note place="margin">8.</note> this had not beene so much, but he must kill his sonne, hee must cut his sonne all in peeces, and so offer him up to God, wherein his heart might have disputed with that sinfull act of murder.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if another had beene to doe it, to cut his sonne in peeces, <note place="margin">9.</note> but <hi>Abraham</hi> must doe it himselfe, the tender Father must take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the life of his tender child.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="614" facs="tcp:14764:317"/>
Againe, it had not beene so great; if <hi>Abraham</hi> had beene to doe <note place="margin">10.</note> it presently, or neere to some of his friends, that might have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him from this Act; but <hi>Abraham</hi> must goe three dayes jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and must goe to an unknowne place, and there must poure out the heart and bloud, and life of his <hi>Isaac.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In these many particulars we may see the greatnesse of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> triall; O the heighth and depth, and bredth of this triall, no one could impose such a triall, but a God, and none could answer such a triall but an <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iob</hi> may come in as another instance, God gives <hi>Iob</hi> this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <note place="margin">Job 1. 8.</note> that hee was an eminent person, <hi>None like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man, and one that feared God, and eschewed evill;</hi> Hee seemed to be the tallest Cedar, and yet hee had the sharpest windes, his eminencie in grace, would not deliver him from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, hee is tried many wayes, in the losse of his cattell, and then in the losse of his servants, and then in the losse of his children, and in the losse of all his children at once, and all on a sudden, and at such a time, the time of his greatest prosperitie: hee is tried by his neere friends, condemned for an hypocrite, and by his owne wife contemned, and tempted to curse God; and he was tried by God himselfe, <hi>Hee wrote bitter things against him,</hi> and fastened his arrowes in his spirit.</p>
                  <p>But to leave these instances, let me crave leave a little to touch upon two things for the full and cleere opening of this point.</p>
                  <p>First, I will shew you wherein the strength of a tryall may consist.</p>
                  <p>And secondly I will shew you, why God is pleased to lay <note place="margin">Wherein the strength of a tryall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.</note> strong and great trialls, upon strong and great Christians.</p>
                  <p>First, wherein the strength of a triall may consist, and I will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve sixe things which may make a triall great; <note place="margin">1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, one is the goodnesse, and kindnesse of the agent that deales with us, when any neere to us in a singular relation to us, shall seeme to turne against us, and spoyle us, and persecute us, when a deare friend shall prove a bitter enemy; O this is a heavy triall, no sword cuts so sharpe as this, nothing makes a greater wound then this; when God himselfe shall seeme to reject: Hee who had said thus much, I will be a God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and I will blesse thee, and multiply thy seed, and yet now to command him a <hi>Duell</hi> with his sonne: for a man to meet with a condition of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and sorrow, when he expects all mercy and compassion, and tendernesse of love; O this doth cause singular sorrow: to meete with waves in the middest of the Ocean, it is a common thing, but to thrust the ship into some harbour, and there to meet shipwrack, O this is very much: for a Christian to find scornes, and hard usage from the world, this is but an ordinary thing; but when he lookes
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:14764:317"/>
up to heaven, &amp; receives such lookes and frownes from God, that fetch teares from his eyes, and from his heart, this is much more.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the strength of a tryall may consist in the neernesse of an object, when the triall is not that which rends the garment, but <note place="margin">2.</note> rends the heart; for a woman to lose her ring, is not so much, but to lose her husband, this is much more; for a man to lose an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing is something, but to lose a child is much more; this many times is the renting of the loynes a sunder, for <hi>David</hi> to lose a servant is not so much, but when <hi>David</hi> loses an <hi>Absalom,</hi> then he cries out, <hi>O Absalom my sonne, would God I had died for thee. O Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom my sonne, my sonne.</hi> God is pleased many times to trie his servants, <hi>by taking away the delight of their eyes, and the joy of their heart,</hi> and the hope of their lives.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the strength of a triall may consist in the neerenesse of a comfort, a triall is strongest when it seemes to plucke away the <note place="margin">3.</note> thing that is neerest the heart, when God pluckes away a Childe sucking at the breast, when he takes away that wherein our delight is fixed; when God on a sudden, doth take away and consume the Gourd that shadowed <hi>Ionah,</hi> when he snatches away the thing that wee take content in; O this will enter to the quicke, and greatly amaze us, when our affection is placed, and setled in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed object, in a person that wee neerely love, and now to take away that comfort, and as it were to diverse the heart from the heart; O this goes neere us, this doth exceedingly trouble a person.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the strength of a triall may consist in the suddennesse <note place="margin">4.</note> of it, to enjoy a comfort, and on a sudden to have it taken away, as it were a mans sleepe, such a thing that he did not dreame of, when hee did not expect, that such a thing would befall him, if a man had heard something before hand, hee might have beene better fitted for it; When the Prophet saw the Cloude descend out of the Sea, being warned of abundance of raine, hee hastened to escape. So if a person have fore-notice of such a crosse that would fall upon him, hee might be somewhat armed and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he might in some measure be able to beare his triall, like a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Boate well mannaged may meet with lofty waves, but when the affliction shall take a man at unawares, when it takes us before wee can gather our selves together, before wee can put out our selves in prayer; for a man to goe forth, and come home and find a wife dead, and for a Woman to goe forth, and come home and find her Husband dead: for a tender Mother to kisse her child, and lay it downe to rest, and the next turne to find her child dead; this is a great triall.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the strength of a triall is in the successivenesse of a triall, the repetition of atriall, when <hi>Iobs</hi> messengers come with newes <note place="margin">5.</note>
                     <pb n="616" facs="tcp:14764:318"/>
of one affliction, having scarse delivered their message, and their errand, but another comes, when there is a course of triall one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another; <hi>Thou, O Lord, hast set mee as a marke,</hi> saith <hi>Iob;</hi> Why a marke? why God had, as it were, singled him a man for sorrow and triall, one arrow had no sooner lighted on him, but another comes and pierces him; Now this doth deeply prove our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and makes us sometime wonder, that the Lord should give us no rest, when one affliction shall succeed another, without any Cordiall; when the handkerchiffe shall no sooner wipe off one teare, but presently another distills downe; Herein is a great strength of triall, the heart is wonderfully cast downe.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, the strength of a triall may consist in the strangenesse <note place="margin">6.</note> of our obedience to it, as when a matter is put upon us as a dutie to be obeyed, and hath some contradiction to the precept of God: when a triall doth crosse the precept of obedience, and jussell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the promise of God, that a man can hardly obey God, but hee must make God a lyar. <hi>Abraham</hi> could not have obeyed God in killing his Child, but hee must runne against that other command, forbidding murder; hee could not deferre it, but hee must violate his faith; Now this doth exceedingly distract the Soule with a great triall, the more contrary the triall is to the precept of obedience, the greater is the triall, and the more neere to the person.</p>
                  <p>But I proceed to the next question.</p>
                  <p>Why the Lord doth impose great trials upon great Christians, <note place="margin">Why God lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth strong trialls, on strong Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> the reasons of it may be these;</p>
                  <p>First, great grace will be obscure, and will scarse shew it selfe, unlesse there bee great trialls; and therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> when hee was lift up to the third heavens, lest hee should be exalted above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, there was given him <hi>a thorne in the flesh,</hi> hee is beaten downe with temptation, that the grace of God might the more appeare. God doth hereby prevent our fall, and doth hold great grace in great conflicts, that the soule might have little leasure to admire its owne fulnesse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, great trialls for great Christians, because who is more able to susteine great trialls then great Christians? God is <note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> wise in all his actions; and as <hi>Paul</hi> speakes in another case, there was milke for babes, and meat for strong men; so when hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses many affliction, he considers the person, and so proportions the affliction: hee imposes the greatest burden, upon the greatest Christian, a little blast is enough for a tender oake, but a well grounded one may indure the strongest winds: a poore weake Christian, a little triall will cast him downe, but a well experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Christian that hath inriched himselfe with the promises of God, that hath hardened himselfe with the receit of singular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:14764:318"/>
one that knoweth the life of faith, that hath gotten singular patience, he can indure a hard storme, hee can goe through great trialls with great comfort; Hee can say with <hi>Iob, though thou dost kill mee, yet will I trust in thee;</hi> hee will bee able to goe through many sad nights, and great trialls, his faith will make him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer all.</p>
                  <p>I come to the second point, and that is this, that
Faith will make a man acquit himselfe in great Trialls. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Faith acquit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> a man in great tryalls.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Abraham</hi> is put upon it, in a great triall, in offering up his sonne, yet <hi>by faith Abraham</hi> acquits himselfe, and <hi>offers up his beloved sonne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The meaning of the proposition is this, that faith will inable a man to give backe his dearest comfort againe to God, though <hi>Isaac</hi> lie in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, though <hi>Isaac</hi> lie at <hi>Abrahams</hi> heart, yet <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith upon Gods call will take him thence, and present him to that God who gave him.</p>
                  <p>Faith makes a man resigne up willingly unto God his dearest comfort, as <hi>Iob</hi> did; <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, blessed be the name of the Lord.</hi> Beloved, remember this, faith can take a mercy and be thankfull, and faith can part with a mercy and be content. <hi>Paul</hi> hee had <hi>learned how to abound, and how to be in want;</hi> and this lesson was the lesson of faith: faith makes a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian take from Christ, what it injoyes, like one of the blessed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, his condition was, if God gave him any mercy, he was chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; if the Lord take away any mercy, hee sets downe with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, quieting his soule in patience, if God give him any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he was not swolne with pride; if God take away any mercy, he was not cast downe with sorrow. Dost thou remember mee, O Lord? saith faith: Lord I am unworthy the least of all thy mercies and goodnesse. Lord dost thou call for this blessing back againe? why here it is Lord, doe what thou pleasest; like an honest debtor, saith he, if you can spare me a little, I will thanke you, but if you will have it, here it is; as the blessing is a gift of Gods kindnesse, so neither doth faith account of any mercy, but a borrowed, a lent good which God may require when he pleases.</p>
                  <p>There is a double acquitting of our selves, one is a necessary acquitting, and the other is a pious, and Christian acquitting: there is this difference betweene a godly man, and another, when God calls for any one of thy comforts, it must be restored, God is the Lord of life, and whether we are willing or not, when he calls, the comfort and we must part, and in this respect a man who wants a lively faith, may acquit himselfe in a triall, when hee sees that floods of teares will not help him, specially when he sees it is past recovery, he resignes up a comfort, when he can keepe it no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, hee will part with a blessing when hee cannot avoid i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:14764:319"/>
But then there is a pious acquitting of our selves, when God calls for a comfort backe, the hand of Faith presents the comfort to God againe, when God calls for <hi>Isaac, Abraham</hi> presently resignes up his beloved Sonne againe, upon this ground; God is the Lord who gave him, and now the Lord calls for him backe againe; I and the Lord shall have him; thus Faith acquits the soule in great triall, and joynes with God against all our owne contentments, to set downe with much patience in great losses, to submit to Gods call, and Gods appointment.</p>
                  <p>Now the reasons why Faith can acquit a man in great trialls <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> may be these. First, Faith can exalt Gods will above all, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our wills to Gods will, remember this. God is the Authour of mercy, when he will he gives us, and when hee pleaseth, hee takes it away againe. It is well to have abundance, saith nature, and sence, we cannot be without it? no saith Faith, I will yeeld to Gods will, it is good to enjoy this saith Sence; it is better to part with it, saith Faith, when God calls for it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Faith can give God the glory of all outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, this is a great occasion of stilling our soules, to find out <note place="margin">2.</note> the right owner of ourcomforts; if a man did once discerne that by faith, that God is the Authour of all comfort, and that all mercyes come from God, this would make us submit in the day of triall: this is certaine, God is the God of our bodyes, and of our soules, and of our comforts; who hath more right to posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion then the owner, all our comforts are but Gods servants, God is the great Land-Lord of heaven and earth, the God of all our possessions; what if hee be pleased to gather a flower, wee are but tenantsat will, and whatsoever our outward estate is, Faith over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookes all, and submits all to God, and receives it by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and doth as it were heare the Lord say, I must doe what I will with mine owne; Faith makes a man say, nothing is mine owne, my Child is not mine owne, my Wife is not mine owne, it is Gods possession, when God calls for it; Faith resignes it up as Gods due, faith <hi>renders unto God, the things that are Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Faith can make the soule acquit it selfe in great trials, because faith findes no losse by obedienciall submission, for all <note place="margin">3.</note> our unwillingnesse to resigne up, and to part with any comfort, it doth arise from infidelitie, or from the stubbornnesse that is in a person, when a man haves and holds his comfort contrary to Gods will; or else it doth arise from a conceit that some dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage will redound to our selves, in parting with such a blessing, but faith sees safety enough to yeeld up all into Gods hands, who is <hi>the Father of mercy, and God of all consolation.</hi> Thus we see <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> being put to it about his only sonne, he gives up his child, his <hi>Isaac,</hi> and God bestowes <hi>Isaac</hi> upon <hi>Abraham</hi> againe; nay, a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:14764:319"/>
degree of blessing confirmed with an oath; <hi>In blessing, I will blesse thee; and in multiplying, I will multiply thee, and will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven;</hi> This is ever true; faith makes a man give back a blessing with this conclusion, either God will continue the comfort to a person, or else he wil give him more, or a better for it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, a fourth reason why Faith can make a man acquit <note place="margin">Reas. 4.</note> himselfe in great trialls, because Faith can find all losses made up in God alone; Faith can find God as a most ample and universall good; Faith doth looke upon God as a particular good, and such a good that answers all againe, that abundantly makes up all losses: There be many broken peeces of comfort that must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to make up our outward good; for our good here below is a compounded good, the Wife is a part that makes up our good below; and our children are a part that makes up our good below, and our health, and our riches, and our friends; many of these concurre together, to make up our good below: but God is all this in himselfe, and much more, whatsoever good, whatsoever comforts, are in a Child, a Wife, a Husband, or in friends, in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in health, all that is in God, and much more to faith: what is that thou seest in a Husband, or in a Wife, or in a Child, that thou mayest not see in God? What is that thou findest in a friend, that thou mayest not findin God? and what is there in riches, that thou mayest not have much more in God? the Husband can doe thee no good without God, who can doe thee so much good as God? the Husband can comfort thee, who can comfort thee so much as God? a friend may counsell thee, and direct thee, but hee cannot deliver thee; Faith sees more in God then in riches, more in God then in all outward blessings; bring all the outward comforts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they cannot make up a Christians comfort; Faith is never satisfied with these things, it is not a Child alone, nor a Husband alone, nor a Wife alone, nor a friend alone, that makes up a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians comfort, but God alone can doe it; whatsoever is in any outward comfort, Faith findes it much more in God, God and his favour, God and his gracious countenance, these make up a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians comfort, this alone supports the Christian, and in the want of all things Faith can comfort it selfe in the favour of God; in the losse of all things, Faith can find all againe in the favour of God. This is a fourth reason why Faith makes a man acquit himselfe in great Tryalls.</p>
                  <p>A fift reason why Faith makes a man acquit himselfe in great troubles, because Faith knowes upon what tearmes wee possesse all <note place="margin">Reas. 5.</note> these outward comforts, upon what small grounds wee possesse them; upon moveable and changeable titles. Faith lookes upon all these things, as upon things that hee must part from; we have here no abiding Citie, our place and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ing here is but for a short
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:14764:320"/>
time, and remember this, God never bestoweth any comfort up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee or mee, with an assurance of an immortall possession, all the assurance that he hath given thee is nothing, all the creature is but vanity, it is of a shifting nature, and therefore it is said of <hi>riches,</hi> that <hi>they doe take to themselves wings,</hi> they skippe away, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is soone gone, riches are soone gone, the life of man is soone gone, the life of man is but a breath, a vapour which is presently consumed, but a glasse of a brittle substance, all our comforts are of a changeable nature; that whereon wee set our affection, is taken from us in a moment.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have opened these two points, now give mee leave to make some use; I will spare to speake to you of the occasion of our meeting together, for <hi>Funerall Sermons</hi> are not for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the dead, but for the instruction of the living: there are two Uses that I will make of those two propositions; I know many more may be produced, but I consider the time.</p>
                  <p>The first Use is this; Since great tryalls may befall great Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> then let us prepare for great tryalls, for as much as such kind and degrees of affliction and crosses may befall us. There are two things that a man should alwayes provide for, one is while wee live to provide for Death; the other is while we are in prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to provide for affliction, for a change: and for this consider two things;</p>
                  <p>First, our outward condition is but a shadow, it hath a naturall <note place="margin">1.</note> aptnesse to change; there is not a person that heares mee this day, but this may concerne his outward condition; <hi>Man is borne unto trouble,</hi> saith <hi>Iob, as the sparkes flie upward;</hi> as if trouble were his naturall spheare wherein he is to move.</p>
                  <p>Thou canst not assure thy selfe of life, no not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor of any of these outward comforts, neither canst thou promise thy selfe securitie in any state or condition, though thou maist get assurance that God will save thee, yet thou canst never get assurance, that God will never trie thee; wee see that Death enters into many houses of this Citie at this time, in one house, one hath lost a Father; another hath lost a Wife, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath lost a Husband, another hath lost a Child, another is in sorrow for the losse of a deare friend; and therefore wee should provide for a change, because the next commission of Death, may enter into our houses; it is our sinnes that puts our lives upon these conditions; our sinnes doe alwayes leave something contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our comforts, to alter and change our present condition, Death takes away our life, and plucks away our comfort, and dis-inherits us of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> these outward things; how soone doth Death lay honour in the dust? how soone is beautie ecclipsed by defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie? our strength laid down by weaknesse? our health overcome
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:14764:320"/>
by sicknesse, our life overtaken by Death; all these may ecclipse our comforts, these cloudes may soone darken our sunne; one thing or other every moment is ready to put out our candle, to darken our day, to cease our life; alas what is life but a shadow? What is honour but a blast? what are the things we doe so much pride our selves in? they are but as <hi>Ionahs</hi> Gourd, which perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a moment, and many times the cause of our sorrow and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; the losse of them a greater griefe then the want of them, this staffe on which we leane will soone bee broken; a Ship may last for a while, but shee will sinke at the last. What is the Wise mans verdict of all things under the Sunne? hee concludes they are <hi>all vanity;</hi> that is not enough, they are <hi>nothing but vanity;</hi> that is not enough neither, they are <hi>nothing but vanity, and vexation of spirit,</hi> things lesse then nothing: then how little is it that wee are to expect from them? we should provide for a change; not onely our outward condition is thus changeable, but our inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition too; our spirituall comfor is changeable, though there is stability in the maine, yet a Christian meetes with many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions. Beloved, if our condition were not changeable, I would hold my tongue from exhorting you to provide for a change.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as our our outward condition is cast upon many <note place="margin">2.</note> changes, so when these changes doe befall us, when they come to strippe us of our comfort, verely they will put us to it. Thou art mistaken, thou thinkest thou canst beare a losse, or a crosse, it is not so easie a matter to beare the losse of a Childe, or a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or a Wife, or a Father, or the losse of a deare friend; it is not so easie a thing to beare the losse of an estate, as thou thinkest, thou shalt find it a hard matter to beare in worldly sorrow, wee may seeme to take courage before affliction comes, but when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and tryalls fall upon us, then we are put to it: it is with us, as with a Shippe, when the Sunne doth shine, and the Seas are calme, and the Wind faire, then shee goes on pleasantly in her motion, but in a storme all little enough to keepe her steady: in our easie dayes, in our dayes of peace, in our calme estate, then wee can hold up our heads well enough; but in our losses and crosses, wee shall hardly beare up, unlesse the Lord doe mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly support us.</p>
                  <p>Wee may observe two sorts of persons in the world, some are insensible persons, who are like the Rocke that nothing can breake <note place="margin">1.</note> it; who are so hardened, that though God doe scourge them, yet they feele it not, though God doth threaten them, they feare not, though Gods hand be already upon them, they regard it not; a condition not so much now to be checked, as to be deplored. To such persons it is all one, whether God blesse, or whether God

curse; whether hee speake by his Word, or by his Rodde, it is all one to them, they feele nothing, nor feare nothing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is another sort of persons, who are sensible <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> persons, sensible of Gods love, and sensible of Gods anger; they know that God is good and wise, that hee doth not strike off our comforts from us, but upon some speciall cause. Now to stay upon God, and to yeeld to the Lord; <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe what seemes good unto him.</hi> God doth not deprive me of such a comfort, but hee sees it best for me. Beloved, it were good to learne this lesson, it will cost thee something in a neere tryall, to acquit thy selfe by faith, to acquit God, and to submit to his chastisement, to kisse the rodde, to judge the sinne, to bend the soule, to better the life, this were an excellent lesson to learne in all our tryalls and afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if great tryalls may befall great Christians, and <note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> faith is that which will make a man acquit himselfe in great try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; then get faith, use faith. What faith is, I have divers times dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in this assembly, whence it comes, from heaven, how we may attaine it, by the Word and Prayer; but to omit these I say get faith, labour for this grace of faith, if there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason but this, it is able to support us in our dayes of tryall, it is able to give us comfort in our greatest sorrow; this were motive enough to make us labour to get faith, the day of tryall being so common, and we apt every moment to fall under some tryall or other.</p>
                  <p>There be foure vertues and speciall effects that faith workes in the soule, which will inable us to goe through great tryalls, and therefore wee should labour to get this grace of faith into our soules.</p>
                  <p>First, faith gets assurance; Secondly, breeds submittance; Thirdly, dependance; and lastly, conveyance.</p>
                  <p>First, faith gets assurance, it can eye God as our God, though <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> the stormes be very great, yet God can quiet it. When a man though hee sees his outward comfort dead, yet Faith sees it in the hand of a living God; Faith assures the soule, God will put an end to the tryall, though there bee a changeablenesse in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition, yet there is safetie in God, and setlednesse in God. Though a man may looke with a dull eye upon his losse, yet if hee can looke upon God with the eye of faith, as his God, the absence of a poore creature cannot so much trouble him, as the presence of a gracious, and a glorious God, can comfort and support him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, submittance is another effect of faith, which faith <note place="margin">2.</note> workes in the soule: our outward condition is subject to many changes, and many times we meet with them, and we are hindered
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:14764:321"/>
in our comforts, and naturally we grow impatient, and murmure and quarrell with Gods providence; but now there is a vertue in faith, it fashions the heart, and the mind to the condition, faith makes a man submit to God in all estates, to make us stoope to our burthen, <hi>it is the Lord saith Ely:</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. let him doe what seemes good unto him; and in the 39. <hi>Psalme,</hi> saith <hi>David, I was dumbe, and opened not my mouth, because the Lord did it.</hi> Observe this, unbeliefe makes a man dumbe, and faith made <hi>David</hi> dumbe. <hi>Zachary,</hi> because he beleeved not the word that the Angell spake, hee was dumbe; and <hi>David</hi> because he beleeved the word of the Lord, he was dumbe, unbeleefe procures dumbnesse, as a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from God, but faith makes a Christian dumbe from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, it quiets the soule in silence from murmuring against God, it doth not make a person dumbe, as not to pray, and to praise God, but dumbe in complaint. Good is the word of the Lord, saith Faith.</p>
                  <p>A third effect of Faith is dependance, it will make a man trust God in frowning dayes, <hi>though hee kill me, yet will I trust in him,</hi> saith Faith: we can never lose any outward comfort, but Faith can find a better in God, though an outward losse may come, yet Faith can make it up in God, in the want of an outward comfort it will trust God; <hi>Lord what waite I for,</hi> saith <hi>David, truly my hope is in thee.</hi> Though the Christian estate may be at some time mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yet at no time it is hopelesse.</p>
                  <p>A fourth effect, that Faith workes is conveyance, it can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey something to inable the soule to beare it up in all tryalls: as Faith is an active grace to inable the soule to the performance of duty; so Faith is a passive grace to strengthen the soule to suffer and beare affliction, <hi>To yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>it is given not onely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, but also to suffer for his Name.</hi> Faith will call in strength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to beare affliction: wee see many times a poore Christian by the strength of faith is able to beare a great losse, and undergoe a great tryall. God is pleased to exercise a Christian with great affliction, but Faith carries the soule along through all: remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this, Faith beares Gods tryalls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with Gods strength, there is a power in Faith which exceeds all outward crosses and losses; Faith drawes strength from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>mise, for there is no crosse nor affliction, but Faith can find a support in the promise of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. Faith makes a man see the affliction, as it were, come out of the hand of the Lord, out of the hand of Mercy; Faith can convey comfort to the soule in affliction, by making it see the chastisement delivered from the hand of a wise and loving Father, that our chastisement is for our profit, for our future advantage, and that this is sent for our personall good: if thou couldest get but a sensible denyall of thy selfe, and by faith see all things
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:14764:322"/>
measured out by the Lord: this would make us with patience, take from God what hee imposes upon us; Faith will make a man conquer himselfe, it will silence all murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and make the Soule beare its crosse with patience.</p>

The very priviledge it selfe (as at the first view of the Text may appeare to you) affordeth a fit Theame for such an occasion as this is; which is the solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of the Funerall of a Grave, pious, and prudent Matron, who was indeed while she lived <hi>a Mother in Israel,</hi> in the Church of God: who in her life-time testified much love to the Saints of God, and in that respect I may say deserved (now shee is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way) this respect of Gods Saints and children, which by you is now shewed to her in accompanying her to her Bed of rest.</p>
                  <p>The forenamed words of my Text, doth branch it selfe forth into two parts. <note place="margin">Parts of the Text.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>One setteth out the priviledge it selfe.</p>
                  <p>The other, the partakers thereof.</p>

                     <pb n="628" facs="tcp:14764:324"/>
The Priviledge, therein you may observe two points;</p>
                  <p>First, the kind of it, <hi>Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ground of it, <hi>Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The partakers of this priviledge are set forth in a compounded Article, <hi>Ioynt-heires, Co-heires, heires together,</hi> having relation to Women.</p>
                  <p>The simple consideration of the Word, shewes the right they have to the forenamed priviledge, they are <hi>heires.</hi> The compound shewes the extent of it, <hi>Co-heires,</hi> one with another, Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>heires together of the grace of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That yet you may a little more distinctly discerne the scope of <note place="margin">Coherence.</note> the Apostle in this Text: in a word, note the inference of it upon that which goeth before, or the connection of it therewith. Lift up therefore your eyes but a little higher to the words going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and you may observe the Apostle giving a direction to men to <hi>honour</hi> Women, notwithstanding they are <hi>the weaker vessels: Vessells</hi> they are, therefore capable of that which God shall bee pleased to infuse into them, his grace: they are <hi>weake vessells,</hi> so are men also, they are <hi>earthen vessells:</hi> these are the <hi>weaker;</hi> these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively may bee said to bee as glassie <hi>vessells,</hi> and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, you have a common saying, that a glasse with good keeping may last as long as an earthen Pot, but both brittle: Now notwithstanding this Sex bee brittle, and the weaker, yet to be honoured, and that upon this ground, because partakers with Men, and as well as Men, of the greatest priviledge, <hi>the grace of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Were this a meeting for the solemnization of a Mariage, I might further descan upon this plaine-song, that ariseth from the inference, of Mens honouring of Women. What have I said if it were a Mariage solemnitie? surely, howsoever here bee before our eyes, the eyes of our bodies, a visible object of mortalitie; yet notwithstanding, here is before us, an invisible occasion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, as at a Mariage solemnitie, to the eye of our soule, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and faith: for while here we live in the world, Jesus Christ, our Spouse, hee hath his friends, <hi>friends of the Bridegroome,</hi> his Ministers and messengers, that in his name come to us, wooe us, use all the meanes that may be, to move us to accept of Christ for our Lord and Husband; When a man accepts of this offer, there is then the contract consummated, in regard of the mutuall consent that passeth betweene the one and the other; Christ ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Proxies here, wee the Ministers being for him; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beleeving soule for himselfe. This contract continueth so long as here wee remaine in this world; when wee depart, the body is laid in the <hi>Bride-bed,</hi> quietly to rest, and sleepe, till the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome be pleased to come and awake his Spouse, and it will be a blessed voyce that hee shall come withall, <hi>Come yee blessed of my

Father, receive the kingdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world.</hi> As for the soule, that, goeth immediatly to Christ, and is in his <hi>Fathers house</hi> with him; the <hi>Spouse</hi> in that part, with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band the Lord Christ, enjoying an eternall, inviolable commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and sweet societie.</p>
                  <p>But howsoever this is thus to the invisible eyes of the soule, we now must looke upon the object here before us; and answerably order our matter; and therefore with this touch I let passe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and come to the substance of the Text.</p>
                  <p>You heard the <hi>summe;</hi> you heard the <hi>parts.</hi> But wee must here proceed, <hi>Huesteron</hi> and <hi>Proteron;</hi> and cleane invert the order of the words, as I hope your selves will discerne, if you doe but well marke the order and method: <hi>Life</hi> is in the last place; <hi>Grace</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it; the right, that commeth before it; and the extent of that right, before all. I suppose therefore you will thinke that first it is meet; to lay forth the priviledge it selfe, <hi>Life:</hi> and then to speake of the ground of it: then of the right that we have; and then of the Extent of that right: and this order I purpose to follow.</p>
                  <p>First, therefore concerning the Priviledge it selfe, <hi>Life.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The first branch of the Text. <hi>Explication</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>For brevities sake, I forbeare to speake much of the divers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptations of <hi>life,</hi> and distinctions thereof, as it is in the <hi>Creatour, the onely true God,</hi> Father, Sonne, and holy Spirit: or as it is in the invisible and glorious creatures, the <hi>Angels:</hi> or as it is in men, who are animated by a reasonable soule: or as it is in those creatures that are guided only by sense, Beasts, Fowle, Fish: or otherwise as it is in Trees and Plants, that come forth out of the earth, having a vegetative life onely. <note place="margin">1. What life it is that is here meant. Eternall life proper to the Saints.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>life</hi> here meant, is that wee call <hi>eternall life;</hi> consisting in our communion with Christ our Spouse: and this is a life proper to the Saints; proper unto them, because comming from the grace of God, extended unto them alone; proper unto them, because they are <hi>heires</hi> of it. And in this extent, there is a restraint; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the extent bee in divers considerations, yet a restraint, a qualification; onely beleevers, onely sound true Christians, to them it is proper.</p>
                  <p>And this <hi>life</hi> is to be considered, either in the Inchoation and beginning thereof; or in the consummation and accomplishment thereof.</p>
                  <p>In regard of the Inchoation of this speciall <hi>life</hi> of the Saints, <note place="margin">Begun in this world. Gal 2. 20. Hab. 2. 3.</note> it is here begun in this world: <hi>I [now] live</hi> (saith the Apostle, speaking even of this <hi>life) by the faith of the Sonne of God:</hi> And <hi>the Iust shall live by faith.</hi> This life it is by Christs dwelling and living in us: <hi>I now live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me,</hi> saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle in the place before quoted. <note place="margin">Consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the world to come.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other, it is in the world to come; and it is by a sweet
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:14764:325"/>
feeling and fruition; it is by our abiding with Christ, and living with him: in which respect, saith our Lord Christ, to the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent beleever upon the Crosse, <hi>This day</hi> (the very day that he died) <hi>shalt thou be [with me] in Paradise:</hi> and so Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; <hi>I desire to bee dissolved, and to be [with Christ,]</hi> implying that <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 21.</note> upon the dissolution, immediatly there is a fruition, a communion with Christ: And the same Apostle, speaking of those Saints that <note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 17</note> shall be upon the earth at the very moment of Judgement, <hi>when the dead</hi> (saith he) <hi>are raised, then shall wee also that are alive, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, be caught up together with them in the cloudes, to meet the Lord in the ayre, and so shall wee ever be</hi> [with the Lord.] Now then, marke, here you see the soule hath present communion with Christ upon the dissolution of the body: and the body also shall have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him at the great day of the Resurrection of all flesh.</p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>life</hi> and communion with Christ is proper to the Saints, by vertue of their union with Christ; A misticall union. For Christ the Sonne of God, hee is <hi>life</hi> originally in himselfe, <hi>for as the Father hath life in himselfe, so hath hee given to the Sonne to</hi>

                     <hi>have life in himselfe.</hi> Hee is also <hi>Life</hi> communicatively, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating life unto us; therefore hee is said to be the <hi>Bread of life,</hi> and <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 33.</note> in this sence, because hee is <hi>that Bread which commeth downe from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Use of this point (my brethren) is manifold. I will but touch it. First, it doth instruct us in the great love, and good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1.

Behold what love the Father hath shewed to us</hi> in Christ!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this is a demonstration of the wofull plight where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. For demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.</note> naturally men are in this world: they may seeme to be of some account, they have a life that is farre different from the life of Plants, and also from the life of Beasts; they have a reasonable soule to animate them: Oh but this, this is is not the life; Naturall life indeed is a death compared to this <hi>life</hi> that is here noted to bee proper to the Saints, which commeth by <hi>grace,</hi> whereof <hi>wee are heires:</hi> and therefore of all naturall men it may bee said, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith of the wanton Widow, <hi>shee is dead while shee liveth;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 6.

                  <p>Thirdly, the Saints have here consolation, against the mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and corruption whereto they are subject here in this world; <note place="margin">

that that befalleth one, may befall every one, in regard of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward estate and condition, <hi>All must die.</hi> Nay further, here is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation against the distresses, and afflictions, and pressures, whereto the Saints are subject above others for their profession sake; in this very respect they are hated, they are persecuted, <hi>all that will live godly in Christ Iesus shall suffer persecution; and through</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 12. Act. 14. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>many afflictions wee must enter into the kingdome of heaven.</hi> Where is now their comfort? surely this, that is set before us: you heard that naturall men are <hi>dead while they live:</hi> but those that are in Christ, doe live while they may seeme to bee dead; <hi>Ionah</hi> lived when he was cast into the Sea, swallowed up by a whale, and was even as it were in hell; so the Saints, though swallowed up as wee may say, in the tempestuous sea of this world by cruell Whales, yet notwithstanding they still live that life that is begun here in this world, whereof you heard before: And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. sheweth plainly, that though they are <hi>given up unto death daily for Iesus sake,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 8, 9, &amp;c.</note> yet they are <hi>not destroyed,</hi> not cleane swallowed up, but that they live in Christ, and that Christ liveth in them: <hi>Wee are perplexed, but not in despaire; persecuted, but not forsaken,</hi> &amp;c. And this is it that doth comfort them, both the fruition of that <hi>life</hi> that they have here; and their expectation of the accomplishment, and fulnesse thereof in the kingdome of heaven.</p>
                  <p>Now (my brethren) this is the rather to be observed of us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of all others, the Saints seeme to be most subject to death. And the truth is, here is matter of admiration in regard of their happinesse, that notwithstanding that condition whereto they are subject, there is a life they enjoy in this world; there is a better life prepared for them hereafter.</p>
                  <p>And what can be more desired? Life of all things else is most esteemed: Men are ready in sicknesse, and in other distresses, to spend all that they have (as the Woman that was troubled with the bloudie issue, <hi>spent all that shee had upon the Physitians)</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <note place="margin">Mark. 5. 26.</note> life, to recover health. <hi>Solomon</hi> (speaking according to the conceit of men) saith, that <hi>a living Dogge, is better than a dead Lyon,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 9. 4.</note> any life better then a death, thus they imagine; and Sathan well knew mens account of life, when he could say, <hi>Skin for skin, yea,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job 2. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>all that a man hath, will hee give for his life.</hi> Now, if so bee that this temporall life here, that is but a flower, but a bubble, but a blast, but a breath, yea, that life that in the shortnesse thereof is subject to so much perplexitie as it is, be notwithstanding so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly esteemed; what is the life here promised, that while here in the enjoying, in regard of the first fruits thereof is accompanied with such a <hi>peace</hi> as <hi>passeth understanding,</hi> accompanied with the very <hi>joy</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 7. Rom. 14. 17.</note>

<pb n="632" facs="tcp:14764:326"/>
such glory, as the tongue of man cannot expresse, the mind of man cannot conceive? It is noted of the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was <hi>caught up to the third heaven,</hi> and saw but a glimpse of this life, he did there see (they are his owne words) <hi>unutterable matter,</hi> things that cannot bee exprest. And therefore in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 2.</note> he saith (and that which he saith may be most fitly applyed to this) <hi>the things which eye hath not seene, nor eare heard, neither hath</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It will be here said, whence commeth this? or what may bee <note place="margin">The second branch of the Text.</note> the ground thereof?</p>
                  <p>My Text telleth you; It is stiled here, <hi>Grace of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither will I here insist upon the divers acceptations of <hi>grace;</hi> as it is in man, as it is <hi>Gratis data;</hi> or as it is in God, as it is <hi>Gratis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens,</hi> making us accepted with himselfe: It is more cleare then need to be proved, that <hi>eternall life it commeth from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eternall life commeth from divine grace. Tit. 3. 7. Eph. 2. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>grace: Grace</hi> is the ground of it. <hi>Being justified by grace</hi> (saith the Apostle) and againe, <hi>by Grace you are saved.</hi> And indeed all things that bring us thereto, are in the Scriptures attributed to <hi>Grace.</hi> And needs must it be so. For</p>
                  <p>First, out of God there can be nothing done to move him to doe this or that, as if it should be done for our sakes, either meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> or procuring of it. Hee is independant, and we are depending upon him, and whatsoever wee have is out of our selves, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from him.</p>
                  <p>Againe, in Man there can be nothing. What is there in man but miserie? whatsoever man had, or hath; if there be any good thing, <note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> he hath it from this fountaine of goodnesse, <hi>all our sufficiencie is of God.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is briefly to be noted against that proud and arrogant <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. For confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> position of our Adversaries, concerning the merit of mans workes; as if man, by any thing in him, could merit or deserve this <hi>life,</hi> it is not the merit of life, but <hi>the grace of life.</hi> Surely they know not God, they know not his infinitenesse, his all-sufficiencie; they know not man, his emptinesse, his impotencie, his vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, his cursednesse; they know not this life, they know not the reward, the excellencie of it, the disproportion betweene any thing that man can doe, and this life that is thus graciously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, that have such a conceit: Let them therefore passe with their foolish opinion.</p>
                  <p>For our owne parts, it affordeth to us another ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. For consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

and that in regard of our unworthinesse: for as we are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we are <hi>lesse then the least of Gods mercies;</hi> but as we are mortall creatures, <hi>dust and ashes,</hi> much more unworthy of any favour; but as we are sinfull creatures, having provoked the justice of God, most, most unworthy of any <hi>grace,</hi> of any <hi>life,</hi> most worthy of all judgements and vengeance, of eternall death and damnation. Where is now our hope? what ground shall wee have that have nothing in our selves? Surely this, the ground of this <hi>life,</hi> the grace of God. What God doth, hee doth for himselfe, for <hi>his owne names sake;</hi> Grace is free.</p>
                  <p>And these two joyned together, give evident demonstration of God, to be a God, in the thing that he doth conferre upon thee, and in his dealing of it: the greatnesse of the gift that he doth give; and the freenesse of it. For who can give life, but the God of life, that <hi>hath life in himselfe?</hi> And then againe to doe this altogether upon meere <hi>grace,</hi> upon <hi>his owne good pleasure;</hi> it is a divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie. And this is it that doth incourage us to come unto God, notwithstanding our unworthinesse.</p>
                  <p>And in this respect in the second place wee have here a Use of instruction: to acquaint our selves with God, with the freenesse <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. For instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> of his <hi>Grace;</hi> to plead it unto God when wee come unto him, and notwithstanding our unworthinesse, and our wretchednesse, yet to presse this, <hi>Lord what thou dost, thou dost for thy owne sake, out of thy meere grace, this makes me bold to come unto thee.</hi> Specially upon the consideration of that greatest evidence of Gods free Grace and rich mercy, in giving his Sonne to doe whatsoever is requisite for the satisfaction of his Justice: so that here <hi>Grace</hi> and Justice doe sweetly goe together for the strengthening of our faith; <hi>Grace</hi> in regard of our unworthinesse; Justice in regard of our rebellion; God doth what he doth for his owne sake; his owne Sonne hath made full satisfaction to his Justice.</p>
                  <p>And finally, this should the more inlarge the heart to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: a gift the freer it is, the more worthy of praise it must <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 4. For exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> needes be, the more acceptable to him that receiveth it, when hee receiveth it from meere <hi>Grace;</hi> and he that giveth it, is thereby the more worthy of praise: so that lay these two together, <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>the grace of life;</hi> and then tell mee what sufficient thankes can bee given to him, who out of his <hi>grace</hi> doth bestow this <hi>life?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus from the priviledge in the second part thereof, come wee <note place="margin">The third branch of the Text. The Saints have right to eternall life by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Tit. 3. 7. Col. 1. 5.</note> to the partakers of this priviledge.</p>
                  <p>And first of the simple consideration of it, <hi>Heires,</hi> so that <hi>wee come to a right unto that eternall life by inheritance,</hi> as we are <hi>Heires.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So doe the Texts before noted, expresly set it forth; <hi>Wee are justified by his grace, that we should be Heires of eternall life.</hi> Tit. 3. 7. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giveth thankes to God for the Collossians, <hi>that he
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:14764:327"/>
had made them partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi> And our Lord when hee doth give us possession hereof, inducts us thereunto with this, <hi>inherit the kingdome prepared for you;</hi> take it by <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 34.</note> inheritance; Here is your right.</p>
                  <p>Now we may not thinke that this ground of right to our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall inheritance commeth by our naturall generation, for so <hi>wee are</hi> heires and <hi>children of wrath,</hi> as the Apostle noteth in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. <note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 3.</note> It cannot come by nature, for so it is Christs prerogative, the true proper, naturall Sonne of God; and thus (as the Apostle saith) <hi>God hath appointed him Heire of all things;</hi> but it is by another <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 2.</note> grace, whereby we are made children: A double Grace in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect: a Grace of adoption; and a grace of Regeneration. <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15.</note> A grace of Adoption; for God giveth to us <hi>the spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,</hi> whereby wee are moved to crie and call <hi>Abba, Father;</hi> and by this grace wee are children, and <hi>being children, wee are heires,</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heires, not only one with another, but (as it is there noted) <hi>heires together with Christ,</hi> Coheires with him by vertue of this grace of Adoption. So likewise by the other Grace of regeneration, wee are qualified hereunto, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his first Epistle, Chap. 1. ver. 3. blesseth God, <hi>Blessed be the God</hi> (saith he) <hi>and Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercie hath begotten us againe, to an inheritance incorruptible,</hi> &amp;c. Wee are begotten to this inheritance.</p>
                  <p>This might againe be pressed as a further Argument against <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. For confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the fore-mentioned presumptious Doctrine of Merit: that that commeth by inheritance, commeth not by desert. But I passe it over.</p>
                  <p>This doth afford to us matter of consolation (for this Text is full of consolation every word of it) against the basenesse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.

                  <p>And as it doth administer to us matter of comfort, and a ground <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3.

                  <p>And likewise, to make sure to our selves our inheritance; looke <note place="margin">2.</note> to our evidences; <hi>Give all diligence</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>to make your</hi>

                  <p>And this againe is another comfort to the meaner, and weaker <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. For consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion genreall.</note> sort: that howsoever there may be some difference in regard of outward condition here, yet notwithstanding in the greatest pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge there is no difference at all: and therefore to conclude, concerning these and other consolations ministred to you, I will use the Apostles words, <hi>comfort your selves with these things.</hi>

                  <p>And particularly concerning the Female sex (because the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle here applieth it to them, and saith of them as well as of <note place="margin">Particular.</note> men, that they are heires, Co-heires of the same inheritance) this therefore is to be applied to them, for when the Apostle makes distinction of outward conditions, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 28. hee putteth in this, <hi>Male and Female,</hi> and of these and those hee saith, <hi>all are one in</hi>

                     <hi>Christ,</hi> no difference: for the Female at first were made after the same Image that the Male were, <hi>Hee made them Male and Female in his owne Image,</hi> Gen. 1. 27. Both sorts have the same Saviour, and are Redeemed by the same price: A woman said; <hi>My soule rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 1. 47.</note> 
                     <hi>in God my Saviour:</hi> they are both sanctified by the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: the Apostle saith, that when an unbeleeving Husband is knit to a beleeving Wife, <hi>the husband is sanctified by the wife,</hi> as well as <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 14.</note> in the other case, the Wife is sanctified by the Husband.</p>
                  <p>And this my brethren giveth a checke, to the undue, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just censure, that many doe give to this weaker vessell, that this Sex is (as it were) the imperfection of nature, and I know not
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:14764:328"/>
what, I will not stand upon it, as most unworthy the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>But for the Sex it selfe, it is a particular consolation against that matter of griefe which it might conceive through <hi>Eves</hi> first sinne, not onely in sinning her selfe, but in taking Sathans part to tempt her Husband, whereupon followed subjection to the Man, and likewise paine in travell, and bringing forth of children. But notwithstanding (saith the Apostle of that Sex) <hi>they shall bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if they continue in faith and charitie, and holinesse with sobrietie.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 15.</note> So that you see they have a right too.</p>
                  <p>And the truth is, that God hath graciously dealt with them in making them the meanes of bringing forth the principall ground of this right of the one, and of the other, which is the Lord of life, the Saviour of the world, who was borne of a Woman.</p>
                  <p>Now this Sex is to comfort themselves in this, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing there bee some differences in outward condition, yet they are made partakers of the greatest and best priviledge, alike joynt-<hi>heires of the grace of God.</hi> I find but two things that in Scripture are exempted from that Sex, two priviledges, one to have jurisdiction over the Husband, another, publikely to teach <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 11, 12.</note> in the Church of God: But yet notwithstanding marke a kind of recompence made for this: The former is but particular betweene Husband and Wife: but in lieu thereof a Woman may reigne over many men, yea, over Nations, <hi>Queenes shall bee thy nursing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 49. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>mothers,</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> to the Church. And for the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to recompence that, they may bee, and have beene endued with the gift of prophesie: so that wee see how God doth every manner of way incourage them.</p>
                  <p>One word more concerning men, and so I will conclude this point. Namely admonition to them, answerably to respect the other Sex as those that are Co-heires with them, and therefore while they live, according to their places, according to their gifts, according to the bond of relation that is betweene them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect them: and to shew the same when they are dead by a decent comely Funerall, and maintaining their credit; and giving of them their due praises.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the Text.</p>
                  <p>And now (my brethren) give mee leave, I beseech you, to steppe a little further, and to speake a word concerning this object before mee. Howsoever I am not over-forward at any time to speake much on such occasions; yet at this time I suppose I should doe much wrong to the partie in concealing those things that are meete to be made knowne to the honour of that God who bestowed those excellent endowments upon her, and also injurie to those that knew her. I doe not feare to be accounted a flatterer

by any that heare mee, and if any else shall imagine any such thing, it may, it must needs bee their envie, in that they censure what they know not. My feare is, lest those that did know her should thinke that wrong is done to her by that little that shall be spoken, for enough cannot be spoken of her.</p>
                  <p>You see here a blacke Herse before you, a body in it deprived of life, and within these few dayes animated by a divine soule, now (as we have just cause to beleeve) glorified in heaven.</p>
                  <p>The body of Mistris <hi>I. R.</hi> in regard of Mariage; being the Daughter of Master <hi>I. B.</hi> a Gentleman in <hi>C.</hi> It seemed that as God endowed her with excellent parts every way, so shee had good education. Shee was married to Master <hi>I. R.</hi> a grave pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man, that lived in the fore-named place, who had beene twice Major there, and long continued Alderman, still relyed upon, when any matter of employment was to bee performed, and therefore oft chosen to be a Burgesse of the Parliament out of that Corporation. In the beginning of her mariage (shee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the Word as <hi>Lydia</hi> did) God was pleased to open her heart, and that specially under the Ministrie of a reverend Pastour now some yeares with God, faithfull, painfull, powerfull in his place while he lived, who yet liveth in the many workes hee pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in his life time. I say by his Ministrie being wrought upon, she wonderfully improved the grace that was so wrought in her; and used all meanes for the growth thereof, by continuall apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her selfe to the publike ministrie of the Word, conscionably on the Lords day, frequently also on other dayes, both in that Citie, and in this also, whither she came oftentimes upon sundrie imployments, both while her Husband lived, and likewise since she hath beene a Widow, which hath beene about the space of five yeares. Now I say as shee did thus helpe on the growth of grace by this publike meanes, so also by private, diligently rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Word, not contenting her selfe with a coursorie reading it over by taske (as some doe) but shee had a Paper booke by her, and in reading would note downe particular points, note speciall duties that belonged to such, and such persons, to Magistrates, to Ministers, to Husbands, to Wives, to Masters, to servants; Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall duties that belonged to Christians, as they were Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and that in such a manner, as if so bee they had beene the Common places of some young Divine. And here (by the way) let me tell you what my selfe have seene of an Alderman of this Citie some while dead, who left behind him Volumes of bookes written with his owne hand: his manner was, first he would reade, and after that he would walke up and downe, and meditate upon what he read, and write downe the summe and particulars of it as he conceived, by which meanes hee made himselfe excellently
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:14764:329"/>
skilfull as in Divine, so in humane learning. Thus did this grave Matron, hereby she came to much knowledge: shee gathered also many signes whereby she had evidence of the truth of grace, and there yet remaine divers such heads noted by her with her owne hand, signes of Grace, signes of the truth of it, of the growth of it, of the effects of it, meanes to grow in grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An excellent course.</p>
                  <p>Thus she shewed pietie in reading of the word of God: the like shee did in prayer, hearing others performe that dutie in her Familie, but specially (when shee was both husband and wife, both master and mistris, Death making a division betweene her deare Husband and her selfe) shee used to pray her selfe; and those that heard her, and have given testimonie thereof, admired her gifts that way.</p>
                  <p>Frequent she was (as appeared in her often retyring her selfe to her Closet) in her constant and secret devotion; yea, also shee tooke occasion of much fasting, specially when shee heard of the troubles of the Church. The cause of the Church much affected her, either in matter of rejoycing, or griefe: shee continued it till her dying day, and still her heart was upon the peace of the Church, praying for it.</p>
                  <p>As thus she exercised her selfe in this holy manner, so shee did likewise wonderfully respect those that were the Ministers of God: Amongst many others, I have heard long agoe that worthy Minister (before mentioned from whom I have received most of what I have now related) speake much of her, and of her wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Husband in this respect: The feet of those that brought the glad tydings of salvation were beautifull to her.</p>
                  <p>And as shee was carefull to testifie her respect to them, so shee her selfe gained no little recompence thereby, for shee was still asking them questions, still desiring to have such and such doubts resolved by them.</p>
                  <p>As thus her pietie was manifested, so likewise was her Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, constantly every weeke giving reliefe to the Poore; ready up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occasions that she was moved to, to open her hands, and to open them wide, and that againe, and againe, not wearied in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good.</p>
                  <p>Sober and grave she was in her cariage and attyre, and therein a good example to the younger sort. And thus shee continued even to her dying day; full of sweet meditations upon her death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, my selfe partaked of some of them. Being asked what evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences she had for her salvation? she answered, good: whether she doubted not? shee replyed no: though shee were of a tender conscience, yet she had laid such a foundation, as her faith remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned firme. Shee sweetly ended her dayes with prayers of her
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:14764:329"/>
owne; with desire of the prayers of Ministers still as they came to her; for as she hearkened to, and desired the benefit of their counsell when she lived, so she desired the comfort of their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers now in her death: thus I say with a sound testimonie of her faith, and of her good estate, she ended her dayes, and we may be assured that she is in the Number of those that are Co-heires of the grace of life.</p>
                  <p>I remember the Philosophers make mention of a word which containes in it a kind of collection or combination of all in one. I may say of her that the graces, and vertues, and ornaments of others seemed to be gathered together, and to meet in her: And so her pietie toward God resembleth her to the two pious <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's,</hi> the one the Mother of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the other the Daughter of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel.</hi> Her charitie resembleth her to <hi>Dorcas.</hi> Her love to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of God to the <hi>Shunamite</hi> that provided a Chamber, a Table, and a Candlesticke for <hi>Elisha.</hi> In her relation to her Husband, she shewed her selfe a true Daughter of <hi>Saraah.</hi> In her relation to her children which she had, a <hi>Bathsheba</hi> and <hi>Eunice;</hi> To others a <hi>Priscilla</hi> the Wife of <hi>Aquila,</hi> ready to instruct as occasion was offered. And so my brethren she hath shewed her selfe a follower of those that through faith and patience inherit the Promise.</p>
                  <p>It remaineth to us to set such examples before us, and to bee followers of them, as they have beene followers of others, and as others have beene followers of Christ, that so walking in their steps, wee may also bee in the number of such as have the comfort of this Text, to be Co-heires of the grace of life; which that you may doe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>The rise of this Observation is obvious enough: one spirit workes in all Gods servants, and brings forth like effects, though not alwayes in the same measure, that therefore which is true in <hi>Simeon</hi> (which the very first view of the words import) that the comming of Death was expected, and desired by him, is in some degree verefied sooner or later in all that are the Lords.

                     <note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 8, &amp;c. The ground of the desire of death in the Saints.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The foundation of this desire, is the knowledge and right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the truth of that speech of <hi>Solomon,</hi> to wit, that <hi>the day of death is better, then the day of a mans birth.</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Eccles. 7. 1.</note> They have learned to know that the day of death to Gods servants, is the day of freedome from all miseries, and of entrance into eternall happinesse.</p>
                  <p>The miseries of this life which even the best are subject unto, are many, Losse of goods, losse of credit, losse of friends, aches, paines, diseases, fevers, consumptions, &amp;c. bondage under origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall corruption, and the fruits thereof, as unbeliefe, pride of heart, ignorance, covetousnesse, distrustfulnesse, hatred, lust, &amp;c. the buffetings and temptations of Sathan, societie with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: all these miseries, even the Holiest and dearest servants of God are exercised with, and divers of these doe make them many times mourne exceedingly, and to cry one while, <hi>O wretched man that I am,</hi> 
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> and to groane out another while; <hi>Woe is mee that I am constrained to live in Mesech, and to have my habitation in the tents of Kedar:</hi> 
                     <note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 120. 5.</note> of all these miseries Death is the end to Gods servants.</p>
                  <p>And so also it is an entrance into happinesse: for albeit their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes rot in the Grave, and bee laid up in the Earth, as in Gods store-house untill the last day, yet the soule forthwith even in an instant, comes into the presence of the ever-living God, of Christ, and of all the Angels, and Saints in Heaven, <hi>the spirits of just men made perfect,</hi> to <hi>Abrahams bosome, to bee with Christ</hi> 
                     <note n="f" place="margin">Philip. 1. 23.</note>. <hi>&amp; quanta haec felicitas?</hi> What greater happinesse? It was much that <hi>Moses</hi> obtained to see the <hi>back-parts</hi> of God, <note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 34. 23</note> but how much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter favour is it to <hi>see him face to face,</hi> to have eternall fellowship with God the Father, with Christ the Redeemer, with the Holy Ghost the sanctifier? The knowledge of this benefit of Death, makes the face of it comfortable to Gods servants, and causes them to strive with their owne naturall weaknesse, that so they
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:14764:332"/>
may even long for their day of dissolution.</p>
                  <p>But now against this point divers Objections may be alledged. <note place="margin">Obiect. 1.</note> For first the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, that <hi>Death is the wages of sinne</hi> 
                     <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note>. And else-where hee stiles it <hi>Christs enemie, the last enemie that hee shall subdue is Death</hi> 
                     <note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 26</note>. How should not death then be rather a day of misery to bee trembled at, then a day of happinesse to bee lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for?</p>
                  <p>To this I answer, that wee are to distinguish touching Death, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Respons.</hi> D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ath consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable two wayes.</note> for it must be considered two wayes; First, as it is in its owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Secondly, as it is altered by Christ: in the first sence it is true, that <hi>Death is the wages of sinne,</hi> and the very suburbs and the gates of hell. But in the second taking of Death, it ceases to be a plague, and becomes a blessing, inasmuch as it is even a doore ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of this world into Heaven. Now the godly looke not upon Death simply, but upon Death whose <hi>sting</hi> and venome is plucked out by Jesus Christ, and so it is exceeding comfortable.</p>
                  <p>But then secondly it is objected, that wee reade of many that <note place="margin">Object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.</note> have prayed against death; as namely, first <hi>David, Returne, O Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>and deliver my soule; oh spare mee for thy mercyes sake, for in death there is no remembrance of thee</hi> 
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Psal. 6. 4, 5.</note>. Secondly, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> when the message of death was brought to him <note n="l" place="margin">Esay 38. 3.</note>. Thirdly, Christ himselfe; <hi>Father, if it bee possible, let this cup passe from me</hi>

                  <p>To all these I answer, first touching <hi>Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>d,</hi> that when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Respons.</hi> Why some of the Saints in the Scripture have pray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>d against death.</note> that sixt Psalme, hee was not only g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>vously sicke, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so exceedingly tormented in mind, for he wrestled and combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his conscience with the wrath of God, as appeares by the first Verse of that Psalme, therefore wee must know, that hee prayed not simply against Death, but against death at that time, in asmuch as the comming of it was accompanied with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary apprehensions of Gods wrath; for at another time hee tells us that hee would <hi>not feare, though hee walked through the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of the shadow of Death</hi> 
                     <note n="n" place="margin">Psal. 23. 4.</note> And the like I say touching <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that his prayer proceeded not from any desperate feare of Death, but first that he might doe more service to God in his Kingdome. And with such a kind of thought was Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> desire of disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution mingled <note n="o" place="margin">Phil. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>. 23, 24.</note>. Secondly, hee prayed against Death then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that his death then would be a great cause of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to evill men, to whom his reformation in the State was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ng. Thirdly, because hee wanted issue, God had promised before to <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>there should not faile a man of his seed to sit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the throne of Israel, so that his children did take heed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        </gap> King. 8. 25</note>. Now, it was a great discomfort to him to die childlesse, for then he, and others might have thought, that he was but an Hypocrite, inasmuch as God had promised issue to all those Kings that feared him, and for this cause God heard his prayer, and after two yeares
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:14764:333"/>
gave him a sonne, <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>asseh</hi> by name. And so I say the same touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Saviour Christ, that hee prayed not against Death, as it is the separation betwixt Body and Soule, as appeares by what the Apostle saith, <hi>that hee was heard, in that hee feared</hi> 
                     <note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 7. 5.</note>, for hee stood in our roome, and <hi>became a Curse for us,</hi> it was the Curse of the Law which went with Death, and the unspeakable wrath and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of God which hee feared, and from this according to his prayer, he was delivered.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly wee see in most good men a feare of Death, and a <note place="margin">Obiect. 3.</note> desire of life, and I my selfe (may some godly man say) doe feele my selfe ready to tremble at the meditation thereof, and yet I hope I belong unto God.</p>
                  <p>I answer, that there are two things to bee considered in every <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Respons.</hi> Two things considerable in a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</note> Christian, Flesh, and Spirit; Corruption, and Grace; and the best have many inward perplexities at times, and doubtings of Gods favour: Now it is a truth which our Saviour delivers, that, <hi>the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is willing, but the flesh is weake</hi> 
                     <note n="r" place="margin">Mat 26. 41.</note>. And as in all other good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses there is a combat betwixt the flesh and the spirit; so is there in this, betwixt the feare of Death, and the desire of Death; sometime the one prevailes, and sometimes the other, but yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at last the desire of Death doth get the victory. Carnall respects doe often prevaile farre with the best, care of wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the like. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Here then is a good Marke by which we may know our selves <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> For Tryall.</note> to be Gods servants, <hi>viz.</hi> by the state of our thoughts and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations touching Death. I will so deliver it, as may bee most for the comfort of those that truly feare God. I demand therefore of thee: Dost thou know that the confident and comfortable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Death is the worke of the Holy Ghost in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants? Dost thou desire unfeignedly, that the same may bee wrought in thy heart? Dost thou labour to know what happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse comes by Death to those that feare the Lord? Dost thou grieve at thine owne weaknesse, to whom the thought of Death is sometime troublesome and unsavourie? Dost thou pray the Lord so to assure thee of his favour in Christ, that death may bee desired before it comes, and welcome when it is come! Dost thou when thou hearest this speech of <hi>Simeon,</hi> wish that thou wert able to use the like words, with the like resolution? Surely, these things shew that thou art Gods servant, and that by Death the Lord will draw thee to a place of rest.</p>
                  <p>If these thoughts which I have now named bee strangers to
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:14764:333"/>
thy heart, and thou dost not love to trouble thy selfe to studie about Death, it is an evill signe. The servants of God are not wont to be so secure in matters of this qualitie.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for the first particular, in the first generall part, the desire in the godly of death: the second is their care for it: the point thence is, that</p>
                  <p>It is the care of Gods servants to bee alwayes so prepared for death, as at <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. A special care in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God to be alwayes ready for death.</note> what instant soever the Lord shall send it, they may bee comfortably ready to entertaine it.</p>
                  <p>So much may easily be gathered out of <hi>Simeons</hi> words here <hi>(Nunc dimittis.) Now let thy servant depart,</hi> He did not (as it were) take a day over, in which, and against which to be provided, as though he should have said, Lord, now will I settle my selfe to make provision for my last end, but even now, Lord, at this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry instant; if thou wilt; Death hath beene my ordinary medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and if thou wilt now call me home to thee, I am ready to depart.</p>
                  <p>As in the former point I shewed you how Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> longing agreed with <hi>Simeons, Oh let thy servant depart,</hi> saith <hi>Simeon; I desire to bee dissolved</hi> (saith <hi>Paul.)</hi> So here I will shew you, that there was the same care in respect of Death, in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> as in <hi>Simeon. Now,</hi> if thou wilt (saith <hi>Simeon;) I am now ready to bee offered</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>

                     <note n="x" place="margin">Iob 14. 14.</note>; there was a continuall expectation. <hi>So teach us to number our dayes,</hi> prayeth <hi>Moses, that wee may apply our hearts to wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> 
                     <note n="y" place="margin">Psal. 90. 12</note>. And what wisedome did hee wish, hee might apply his heart unto? but this a, holy care to make provision for another world, seeing in this there was no continuance? The same in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the Authour to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> professeth touching himselfe, and those that were like to him; that <hi>they had here no continuing Citie, but did seeke one to come</hi>

Wee know (saith he) here is no abiding, wee dwell in tents which must remove, in <hi>houses of clay,</hi> which will be broken, therefore wee desire to bee ever ready for that place, which is of more perpetuitie: And so much may bee gathered from that which is upon record concerning <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> he did not onely make ready his Tombe in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, but in his garden, his place of solace and delight: and how could so good a man, so often thinke on death, without labouring and caring to be ever provided for the same; and therefore our Saviour Christ compares his faithfull servants unto those which daily <hi>wait for their Masters comming</hi>

                  <p>Now the reason which so much prevailes with the godly in <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note>
                     <pb n="678" facs="tcp:14764:334"/>
this particular, and which ought to be of sufficient force with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is first, the certaintie, and uncertaintie of death. <hi>Morte nihil certius, As sure as Death,</hi> is an ordinary Proverbe; <hi>What man is hee that liveth, and shall not see death?</hi> (saith the Psalmist <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 89 48.</note>.) That all must die, it is Heavens decree, and cannot be revoked. The thing it selfe, we see is most certaine: yet for some circumstances most uncertaine: for first,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tempus est incertum,</hi> No man knowes when he shall die, in the night, or in the day; in Winter, or in Summer; in youth, or in his latter age.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Locus est incertus,</hi> None know where they shall die, whether at home, or abroad; in his bed, or in the field; who knowes but that he may die in the Church of God, even while he is asleepe at the Word?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Mortis genus est incertum:</hi> No man can determine how hee shall die, whether suddenly, or by a lingring sicknesse; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther violently, or by a naturall course. These things the servants of God know full well, and seriously weigh the same, and that makes them to make conscience of continuall preparation, that whensoever, or wheresoever, or howsoever they die, they may with comfort <hi>commend their soules into the hand of God, as into the hand of a faithfull Creatour</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 19.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they know the miserie of being taken by Death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared: <note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> put case a man should die as <hi>Ishbosheth,</hi> lying upon his bed at noone <note n="d" place="margin">2 Sam 4, 5, 6</note>; or as <hi>Iobs</hi> children, while they are feasting <note n="e" place="margin">Job 1. 19.</note>; or that a man like the rich man in the Gospell, should have his breath taken from him at the very instant, having made no provision for another world, what hope can there be that such a one should be saved?</p>
                  <p>They know thirdly, that the time of sicknesse is the most unfit <note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> time for this businesse of preparation: the senses are then so taken up with the paine of sicknesse, that a man cannot thinke seriously upon ought else; and besides, it is not in our owne power to turne to God when we will: ordinarily God forgets those in sicknesse, that forget him in health: And it is commonly seene, that that <note place="margin">Note.</note> preparation for Death that begins but in sicknesse, is as languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and faint, as is the partie from whom it comes; And although <hi>Vera poenitentia</hi> bee <hi>nunquam sera,</hi> yet <hi>sera poenitentia est rarò vera.</hi> Though I say, true repentance bee never to late, yet late repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is seldome true; when men leave their sinnes, because they can continue to practise them no longer, what thankes have they, or what can that repentance be? These things worke with Gods servants, to studie to be ever ready for the Lord, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay preparation, but to seeke continually to be provided.</p>
                  <p>My Exhortation hence shall begin with that speech of <hi>Moses,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Vse.</note>
                     <pb n="679" facs="tcp:14764:334"/>
                     <hi>Oh that men would be wise to understand this, and that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider their later end</hi> 
                     <note n="f" place="margin">Deut. 32. 29.</note>. I would there were a heart in us to entertaine this doctrine in our best thoughts. I remember the Complaint of old, that men had <hi>made a Covenant with Death, and were at agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Hell</hi> 
                     <note n="g" place="margin">Esay 28. 15.</note>. Death indeed will make truce with no man; but here is the meaning, Evill men perswade themselves, that they are in no danger of hell, or of the grave. Death will not come yet thinketh the oldest man: and when it comes, I hope I shall doe well enough, thinketh the most godlesse man. Thus men couzen themselves with their owne fancies, and so Death steales upon them at unawares, and becomes Gods Sergeant to arrest them, and to carry them away to eternall condemnation. Who amongst us is able to say truly, and upon good ground, as <hi>Simeon, Now Lord,</hi> if thou wilt now command Death to seize upon mee, welcome shall it be unto me, I am even now ready to receive it? How many are there that are extraordinary ignorant in the meanes how to escape <hi>the sting of Death?</hi> How many extreamly secure, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in their lives, yet thought earnestly upon this, how they may die with comfort, and end their dayes in peace? How many prophane ones, that set light by Death, being apt to say like those Epicures, <hi>Edamus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let us eate and drinke, for to morrow wee shall die?</hi> How many that doe put all to a desperate adventure, God made us, and hee must save us, and wee shall doe as well as please God, and there is an end?</p>
                  <p>How many are there, whose hearts, albeit they be in the house of God, and in his presence, are notwithstanding fraughted with malice, with envie, with worldlinesse, with disdaine, with secret scorning, repining at the Word which they heare with weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somenesse, with spirituall sleepinesse and securitie? You that are such as I have now said, thinke in your consciences, what, would you die? if God should now stop your breath, and ascyte you by Death presently, to appeare before his Majestie, being thus full of ignorance, of securitie, of presumption, of unsanctified, of vicious, of malicious, of covetous thoughts, could you find in your hearts to say, <hi>Lord, now let us depart?</hi> Sure wee could not: but Death must needs be to us, as it is said to be to the wicked, <hi>Rex terrorum, the King of terrours</hi> 
                     <note n="h" place="margin">Iob 18. 14.</note>; if it should come upon us, and find us in this case; And yet what know wee how soone, how sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wee may be overtaken? some of us drop away daily, some young, some old, some lie sicke longer, some lesser time; and how soone it will be our turne wee cannot tell; <hi>Our breath is in our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strills, wee are all as grasse;</hi> If the breath of the Lord blow upon us, we doe suddenly wither, <hi>as the flower of the field,</hi> and returne aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e to our first Earth. Why will we not labour to be now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, sith it may be alwayes truly said, We may now depart, either
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:14764:335"/>
while we are here, or in our way home, or in our beds, or at our meat? Who can truly say to himselfe; I am sure, I shall not die this houre?</p>
                  <p>It may be now thou wilt demand of me, What shall I doe, that I may be ready?</p>
                  <p>To insist upon particulrs, would be too long, onely therefore in a word; <hi>The best preparation for death, is are formed life.</hi> He that <note place="margin">How to bee prepared for death.</note> lives religiously, cannot but die preparedly: And it is a thousand to one, if a wicked liver make a gracious end. The Scripture makes mention of a double Death, and so likewise of a twofold Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: the <hi>first Death,</hi> is the death of the body, which is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of it from the soule. The <hi>second death,</hi> is of the soule, which is the separation of it from God. The <hi>first Resurrection,</hi> is the rising from the Death of sinne to a new life: the second is that which shall be of the body out of the Grave, at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now what saith the Scripture; <hi>Blessed and holy is hee, that hath part in the first Resurrection, on such the second Death hath no power</hi> 
                     <note n="i" place="margin">Revel. 20. 6.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Wouldest thou then bee freed from <hi>the second Death,</hi> hell, and destruction, when thou art dead? Now that thou art yet alive la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to have a part in <hi>the first Resurrection:</hi> Note what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith of <hi>the wanton widow,</hi> that <hi>shee is dead whilst shee lives</hi> 
                     <note n="k" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 6.</note>. So he that lives in the pleasures of sinne, and in the wayes of his owne heart, and after his owne lust, hee is dead in soule, though hee be alive in body, and if hee seeke not to come out of this grave, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death shall be his portion.</p>
                  <p>Well then, wouldest thou prepare for Death? wouldest thou be able alwayes to say, <hi>Lord, now,</hi> now I am ready, labour to know God our of his Word <hi>(that is eternall life</hi> 
                     <note n="l" place="margin">Joh. 17. 3.</note>;) Labour to feele Christ live and reigne in thee by his Spirit, labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce every sinne, doe not goe on in any knowne sinne against conscience, renew thy repentance daily, and still survey the state of thy soule, <hi>that wickednesse may not get dominion over thee.</hi> Let Death come when it will, though the Lord should so visit thee, that thou shouldest drop downe suddenly, yet it shall not find thee unprepared, thou hast <hi>a part in the first Resurrection,</hi> there is no feare of <hi>the second Death:</hi> But if thou wilt cherish thy heart in evil, thou wilt goe on in thy ignorance, in thy carelesse worship of God, in thy prophaning the Sabbath, in thy whoredome, oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, malice, drunkennesse, excesse, voluptuousnesse, thou makest rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for hell, and it is not thy <hi>Lord save me,</hi> or <hi>I cry God mercy,</hi> &amp;c. that shall serve thy turne. I will tell thee who thou art like unto, even to a man appointed after a yeare or two, to be burned, and in the meane space must carry a sticke daily to the heape, so thou heapest up wrath against thy selfe, and makest thy score so great,
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:14764:335"/>
that when Death comes, thou shalt not know how to be prepared. And thus have I finished the first generall part of my Text, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the disposition of the godly in respect of Death.</p>
                  <p>I proceed now in a word to the second, the ground, rule, or warrant of this desire, and preparation for death <hi>(according to thy word)</hi> as if <hi>Simeon</hi> had said, this desire that I have now to end my dayes, proceeds not from any carnall discontentment, because I am now old, and can take no great comfort in worldly things, but the ground of it is thy Word and Promise; thou, Lord, hast <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed</hi> unto thy servant, <hi>that I should not die before I had seene my Saviour;</hi> This word is now fulfilled, and the sweetnesse thereof hath given mee that encouragement, that I doe even long <hi>to bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,</hi> and to be united unto thee. Or againe thus, Oh Lord, this care that I have had to provide thus for Death, and to be alwayes in a readinesse, it hath not come from my selfe, nature never taught it mee, but <hi>thy Word hath instructed mee;</hi> If I had not proceeded <hi>according to thy Word,</hi> I should never have knowne how to have prepared my selfe to the time of dissolution. This is the meaning of the words, and so the Doctrine is plain <hi>(viz.)</hi> that</p>
                  <p>Men ignorant in Gods word can never take comfort in death, nor bee truly <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. Ignorant men can neither take comfort in, nor be truly prepared for death.</note> prepared to undergoe it.</p>
                  <p>This is plaine, if we consider the Exposition which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given of that part of <hi>Simeons</hi> speech. It is a generall Rule, that of our Saviour, <hi>Yee erre not knowing the Scripture</hi> 
                     <note n="m" place="margin">Math. 22. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>9</note>. A man ignorant in the Scripture, can never rightly performe any spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all dutie. Hence was that of <hi>David, Thy testimonies</hi> (saith he) <hi>are my delight, and my counsellours</hi> 
                     <note n="n" place="margin">Psal. 119. 24.</note>. If any matter came in hand that concerned his soule, straight to the word of God went hee, to know thence how to doe it; as a man for his Lease, or conveyance goeth to a Counsellour for direction: So againe he confesses, that <hi>if Gods Law had not beene his delight, hee should have perished in his afflictions</hi> 
                     <note n="o" place="margin">Psal. 119: 92, 93.</note>. And so, no comfort, no true quiet in any trouble, much more at Death, without the guidance, and information of the Word. The assurance that <hi>the sting of Death</hi> is plucked out, that Gods wrath is appeased, that sinne is pardoned, that Heaven gate is opened; whence shall wee fetch these, but from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? the directions for a holy life, which is the best preparation for Death; where shall we find them, but in the Scripture?</p>
                  <p>Here then we see is a Caveat to all that have no will, nor desire <note place="margin">Vse.</note> to be acquainted with the Scripture: Divers thinke they should have done well enough, though wee had no such Booke as we call the word of God. To bee a Scripture-man is a by-word, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, a matter of disgrace; and sooner will men listen to some idle Pamphlet, then to a matter of Scripture. Well, beguile not
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:14764:336"/>
your soules, with these vaine conceipts, with your Popish and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall imaginations. I say, and testifie from this place, that that man or woman, which careth not to be taught out of Gods booke, cannot die like a Christian: Who can teach thee the way to dye well, but God? And where doth God teach, but in the Scripture? If our thoughts of Death, if our provision, and preparation for Death be not warranted, and guided by Gods word, it is all in vaine. Lord, saith <hi>Simeon,</hi> my desire of dissolution is <hi>according to thy Word;</hi> my care to be prepared, hath beene ordered by thy Word, hee cannot die with comfort, that cannot make the like profession. And this may serve for the next generall part, the the ground of this desire, and preparation for Death, it is Gods word; <hi>Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart according to thy Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third and last part followes, the nature and qualitie of the death of the Righteous (A departure in peace, or a peaceable dismission.) Here are two things, first a dismission: secondly, a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission accompanied with peace.</p>
                  <p>The word (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) translated (Let thy servant depart) may well be Englished thus, <hi>Let thy servant loose;</hi> Lord free mee, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large mee, set mee at libertie. Hence wee learne, that</p>
                  <p>The servants of God doe by Death receive a finall discharge from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 4 Death freeth Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants from all miserie.</note> of miserie.</p>
                  <p>This is evident out of the force of the phrase here used: <hi>Simeon</hi> knew that so long as hee lived, his soule was (as it were) impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his body, and in it hee was held in bondage under the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of Originall corruption, subject to the assaults and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Satan, in continuall and daily possibilitie to trespasse and sinne against God, beside other afflictions and grievances in the body and estate: but hee had withall this knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the nature of Death, that it was an enlargement to the soule, and a freeing of it utterly and finally from all those, and the like incumbrances.</p>
                  <p>The same may be gathered from the phrase used by Saint <hi>Paul, I desire</hi> (saith he) <gap reason="foreign">

Scripture beares witnesse to it: <hi>Blessed</hi> (said he) <hi>are the dead, which die in the Lord, even so saith the spirit, that they may rest from their labours</hi> 
                     <note n="t" place="margin">Rev. 14. 13.</note>. As long as they live here, they are diversly troubled, when they die their labours are at an end, and they are received into rest.

                     <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> which maintaine a place of torment, even for the servants of God after this life, where they must bee tryed for a time, before they can enter into Rest, and happinesse. This place they terme <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> the torment here they hold to bee unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and farre surpassing any torment which the wit of man is able to devise. But this place among others is sufficient to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw this dotage, for how were death to the Righteous a dismissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a loosing, a freedome from miserie, if there followed after it a torment of farre greater extremitie then at any time before was ever tasted of?

ready to challenge to himselfe a part of this happinesse, and it is a matter presumed upon by many, which shall never enjoy it; I <note place="margin">How to know whether the day of death be a discharge from all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> will therefore give you one certaine marke, by which wee may know assuredly, that the day of our death shall be to us, a day of enlargement, and of finall discharge from all, both former and following miseries, and that is this, If in the time of our life here, our being subject to corruption, and sinne, hath seemed unto us the greatest burden, and bondage. They which have groaned and mourned under their owne naturall corruptions, as it were under some heavy and tyrannous yoke, or as the Israelites mourned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their <hi>Egyptian Task-masters,</hi> to them only shall the day of death, be a day of freedome. If sinne be not a burden to thee; if thou dost not many times lament, and even mourne to thinke how thou art carried captive unto evill; if thou dost not with griefe feele how thou art clogged with corruption, and hindred by it from doing the good which thou shouldest, certainly death will bee to thee the beginning of thy thraldome, and after it thou shalt be a perpetuall bond-slave unto Sathan in the kingdome of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall darknesse. Marke this all yee that take delight in evill, to whom it is <hi>a pastime to doe wickedly,</hi> and who seeke rather how to satisfie, then how to suppresse your owne corruptions, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it a kind of happinesse to follow the swinge of your owne Iusts, and to have libertie to doe as your owne hearts doe lead you; when you dye, this shall be your reward, even a most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and endlesse captivity under Sathan, him have you served in the lusts of sinne while yee lived, his slaves shall you be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of releasement world without end. This is the right Application of this Doctrine, death is a day of enlargement to the godly, it is a dismission.</p>
                  <p>The next particular is, that it is a dismission accompanied with peace, the lesson we are taught hence is, that</p>

                  <p>Thus <hi>Simeon</hi> here, hee prayed for no other thing, but that his end might be as the end of the Righteous is ever wont to bee, even a departure hence in peace.

                     <note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 37. 37.</note>. Agreeable whereunto is that of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon;</hi> that <hi>the righteous hath hope in his death</hi>

                     <pb n="685" facs="tcp:14764:337"/>
First, the assurance which they have of the favour of God in Christ. This must needs breed quietnesse, when I am perswaded in my soule and conscience, that all cause of danger after death is removed, and that God is, and will be, gracious unto mee in his Sonne. What cause of feare is here left, what occasion of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie?</p>
                  <p>If any man shall doubt whether the servants of God have this <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> assurance; I prove it thus, that all of them first or last, have it in some good measure. <hi>If any man</hi> (saith the Apostle, <hi>have not the Spirit of Christ, hee is none of his</hi> 
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 8. 9.</note>. Hence it necessarily followes, that all that are Christs, have the Spirit of Christ, but now <hi>the office of the Spirit is to beare witnesse with our spirit</hi> 
                     <note n="l" place="margin">Cap. 16. v. 16</note>; So that all that are the Lords, as they are endued with Gods Spirit, so they feele this Spirit bearing witnesse to their soules of this Adoption.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the comfortable Testimonie of their owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences <note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> touching their former care to glorifie God by a Religious and godly conversation: Hence came Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> peace, <hi>I have,</hi> saith he, <hi>fought the good fight, I have kept the faith;</hi> Therefore I am sure <hi>there is laid up for mee a Crowne of life</hi> 
                     <note n="m" place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 7, 8.</note>. Hence <hi>Hezekiahs, I have walked before thee, oh Lord, in truth, and with a perfect heart</hi> 
                     <note n="n" place="margin">Esay 38. 3.</note>. Not that they doe ground their hope upon the desert of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranne courses, but because they know good workes to bee the way <note n="o" place="margin">Ephes. 1. 10</note>, and doe understand by the Scripture, that a holy life here, is the first fruits of a glorified life hereafter. Thus we see the truth of this point, and the reasons upon which it is grounded.</p>
                  <p>Now here some may object first, Wee see many worthy men, <note place="margin">Obiect. 1.</note> that have made a great, and an extraordinary profession of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in their lives, and which have also carried themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameably, yet to give appearance of much angiush and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and even of a kind of despaire in their death. How can wee say then; that all good and holy persons have a peaceable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture?</p>
                  <p>I answer first, Wee ought to remember the Rule our Saviour <note place="margin">Respons.</note> gives, <hi>not to judge according to the outward appearance</hi> 
                     <note n="p" place="margin">Ioh. 7. 2. 4.</note>. It is a very weake argument to say, that this, or that man dyeth without <note place="margin">The unquiet departure of many of the Saints clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the ground<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> thereof.</note> peace, because to the standers by hee makes not shew of peace. Certaine it is, that as a man may have peace with God, and yet himselfe for a time, by reason of some tentation not feele it; so a man being sicke, or going out of the world may feele it, and yet others that behold him cannot perceive it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee must know that these outward unquietnesses, which doe many times accompany sicknesse, doe happen as well, <note place="margin">2.</note> and as ordinarily to good men, as to the most wicked, such as are ravings, idle-talkings, and strange accidents in the body; in this sence <hi>all things come alike to all</hi> 
                     <note n="q" place="margin">Eccles. 9. 2.</note>. God hath made no promise
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:14764:338"/>
in Scripture, that those that serve him shall be freed in their deaths from violent sicknesses. Therefore these things must not bee thought to be any abridgement of their peace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wee must consider, that with the best servants of <note place="margin">3.</note> God, Sathan is most busie, when his end is neerest, and when hee is (as it were) out of all hope of prevailing, The <hi>red Dragon</hi> in the <hi>Revelation, had greatest wrath when he knew his time to bee short</hi> 
                     <note n="r" place="margin">Rev. 12. 12.</note>. When the evill Spirit was commanded once to come out of the child, then <hi>it rent him sore</hi> 
                     <note n="s" place="margin">Mark. 9. 26.</note>. Now these temptations, though for the time they be very violent and extreme; so that the party may (hapily) utter out some words, and speeches of dispaire, yet be they no finall prejudice to the inward peace. Interrupt they may, but utterly quench it they cannot, because the <hi>power of God is made perfect through weaknesse.</hi> And so even in death, Sathan re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the greatest foile, when hee thinkes to get the greatest victorie.</p>
                  <p>Thus then I answer in one word; The peace of Gods servants at death is not ever in the like measure felt by them, but yet it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dieth in them: they which behold their death doe not alwayes see it, yet they themselves, sooner or later are sure sweetly and secretly to feele the same.</p>
                  <p>My reason for my assertion is grounded first upon that of the Apostle <note n="t" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 6.</note>; <hi>God commands light to shine out of darknesse:</hi> Hee brings his servants to Heaven by the gates of hell, out of sorrow and angvish, and tentation hee raiseth out their greatest quiet.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because the love of God is eternall and unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note n="u" place="margin">Esay 54. 8.</note>; <hi>Whom hee loves, hee loves to the end</hi> 
                     <note n="x" place="margin">Iohn 13. 1.</note>. It is unpossible that the Lord, albeit he trie, and that sharply, yet should finally forsake those that are his in their greatest extremitie.</p>
                  <p>But againe secondly, if you make a peaceable death to bee the <note place="margin">Obiect. 2.</note> reward of the Righteous, what say you to this? There bee many that in all their life gave little evidence of any Religion, or grace, but of the contrary rather, yet in their death were very quiet and still, and seemed to all that were by, to have in them no manner of vexation, no troublesome thoughts, no perplexed motions, shall wee say that these were good men, because they seemed to goe away in peace.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, it is the common opinion, Doth a man lye <note place="margin">Respons.</note> quietly? hath hee his memorie to the end? died he like a Lambe? surely then hee is gone to heaven: but this is an absurd colecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for. <note place="margin">The see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming-quiet departure of the wicked with the grounds thereof.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, sometime this outward calmenesse is an ordinary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of some diseases, as Consumptions, and such like, by which Nature being formerly weakned, hath not power left to make resistance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="687" facs="tcp:14764:338"/>
Secondly, this outward calmenesse is no argument of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and quiet soule. The Psalmist tells us of <hi>the wicked in whose death there are no bands</hi> 
                     <note n="y" place="margin">Psal, 73. 4.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wee must distinguish betweene securitie and peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt carnall senslesnesse, and true spirituall quietnesse. <hi>Nabals</hi> death was quiet enough <note n="z" place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 37.</note> yet hee were but a <hi>foole</hi> that would adventure his soule with <hi>Nabals:</hi> I see many ignorant persons, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of heathenish, and brutish conversation, very quiet in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, without any feare of hell, and judgement to come, making no doubts, casting no perills, asking no questions, complaining of no sinnes, and so away they goe without any more adoe. What, shall I say that these died in true peace? God forbid. No, when I compare together their ignorant, secure, benummed, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned kind of life, with their senslesse and drowsie kind of death, I must say that these are fearefull signes, these things argue that the Divill had quiet possession, where hee made so small adoe <note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 11. 21.</note>. Thus then notwithstanding these Objections I will conclude, that a peacefull death, is the peculiar and individed priviledge of Gods servants. However it be, yet I know (saith <hi>Solomon)</hi> that <hi>it shall goe well with those that feare the Lord</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Eccles. 8. 12</note>, <hi>but there is no peace to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked saith my God</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Esay 57. 21.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Wee may make Use of this first to be a tryall betwixt our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Confutation of <hi>Furgatory.</hi>
                     </note> and the Romish: for from this Doctrine I avouch that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be no true Religion: because a Papist by the Rules of his owne Religion can never die <hi>in peace:</hi> This is a hard saying, thou maist object, or how can I make it good? I answer by two reasons.</p>
                  <p>First, every Papist is taught to beleeve under paine of <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and <hi>the great curse,</hi> that whosoever dyeth, if hee have not in this life attained to perfection, and throughly purged himselfe from the remainders of sinne by workes of satisfaction, his soule must after death goe into <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and there continue untill hee hath made a full satisfaction: now the paine of <hi>Purgatorie</hi> is held for the time to bee as great as the paines of hell, differing onely in this, that it is not perpetuall: Now I would faine know how can a man die comfortably and in peace, and with a joyfull heart, when hee thinkes with himselfe, that albeit (perhaps) after some yeares hee shall goe to heaven, yet in the meane space his soule must goe into such a place of unspeakable torment, where if the matter be not well plyed by the prayers of them that are alive, and by well feeing the <hi>Priests,</hi> they may hap to lye for many yeares? I say, how can the Doctrine of Popery beget a peacefull death, when it teacheth an expectation of such an hellish <hi>Purgatory?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, every Papist as he is bound of a certaine to beleeve a <hi>Purgatory,</hi> so further must he beleeve, that hee cannot in this life be
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:14764:339"/>
assured of salvation, otherwise then by a kind of confused hope, which may deceive him. Now hee which by the witnesse of his owne conscience is sure that hee hath deserved hell, and cannot attaine to any certaintie of discharge, what comfort can such an one have to dye? hee knowes that when hee is dead, he must come to his account before God, but yet can have no assurance that the Lord will acquit him in Christ Jesus.</p>
                  <p>I wish that this may seriously be considered by us, for the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of us in the truth of Religion: I say againe and testifie, these reasons which I have alledged being weighed, that a <hi>Papist</hi> by his owne doctrine can never expect that which <hi>Simeon</hi> did, <hi>a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture</hi> hence <hi>in peace:</hi> He knowes he must to torment, he is taught that he cannot know in this world that God will pardon him.</p>
                  <p>In the next place let us come neerer home to our selves: that we <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Exhortation</note> must all dye, nothing more certaine, <hi>Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt returne</hi> 
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 3. 19.</note>. God hath decreed it, and it cannot bee revoked: if our end be not peaceable, our estate after cannot bee happy. Let our care then be spent about this one point, how one may attaine to this, to end our dayes <hi>in peace:</hi> I doubt not but wee will all bee ready to say, we hope so to doe: but this is nothing, for <hi>when the wicked man dyeth, his expectation perisheth</hi> 
                     <note n="e" place="margin">Prov. 11. 7.</note>. What becomes of <hi>the hope of the Hypocrite</hi> (said <hi>Iob) when God takes away his soule</hi> 
                     <note n="f" place="margin">Iob 27. 8.</note>? But what course then shall wee take, that wee may finish our course with joy?</p>
                  <p>I will tell thee in few words (I touched it a little before) the best meanes for a peaceable departure, is a godly and religious life: <hi>I have fought the good fight,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and he could comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably from thence inferre, that therefore <hi>there was laid up for him a crowne of righteousnesse</hi> 
                     <note n="g" place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 7. 8</note>. It was Christs owne inference, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finished the worke which thou gavest mee to doe,</hi> and therefore <hi>now, O Father, glorifie thou mee with thine owne selfe</hi> 
                     <note n="h" place="margin">Joh. 17. 4, 5</note>.</p>
                  <p>The reason of it is first Gods promise: <hi>blessed shall bee the undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the way</hi> 
                     <note n="i" place="margin">Psal. 119. 1.</note>: <hi>Those that honour mee, I will honour,</hi> said God <note n="k" place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 30.</note>. Now this promise God will not breake. He that goeth this way, though it be with much weaknesse, with many falls, with sundry imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, with divers wandrings, yet he cannot misse of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised <hi>peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, life eternall hath three degrees, the first is in this life, when a man repenteth, and beleeveth, and is <hi>purged from dead workes, to serve the living God;</hi> The second is in death, when the body goes to earth, and <hi>the spirit returnes to him that gave it.</hi> The third is at the last judgement: These three degrees hang together like three linkes, the second followeth the first, and the third the two former; the last cannot be hoped for, where the first is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:14764:339"/>
for <hi>except yee repent, yee shall all perish</hi> 
                     <note n="l" place="margin">Luk. 13. 3.</note>. The first being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the last must needs ensue: for <hi>hee is faithfull that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised</hi> 
                     <note n="m" place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 24.</note>. So then, wouldest thou have peace in death? labour for grace in thy life; wouldest thou end thy dayes happily? make conscience to spend them holily. A godlesse man that lives in sin, may die senslesly, or sullenly, he cannot die peaceably. Oh <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this all yee that forget God,</hi> that spend your dayes in vanity, and your yeares according to the lusts of your owne heart, that have hitherto hated to bee reformed, and will not bee reclaimed from your former fashions, but live yet still, as you were wont to doe. Thinke a little with me of your last end, which how neere it is you doe not know; when your consciences a little awaked, shall make report of your life past, how in matters of God you have beene ignorant, superstitious, carelesse, neglecting his worship, despising his Word, blaspheming his Name, mispending his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, in dealing with men you have beene cruell, false, unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, oppressing; in the usage of your owne bodyes unchast, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, lustfull, proud, wanton, wallowing in excesse; what peace can your soules have, when these things be thought upon? what calmnesse of spirit? what hope of entring into rest? how can you thinke that the end can bee comfortable, when the life hath beene abominable. What answer made <hi>Iehu</hi> to <hi>Ioram,</hi> when hee demanded, <hi>Is it peace Iehu? What peace</hi> (said hee) <hi>so long as the whoredomes of thy mother Iezabel, and her witchcrafts are so many?</hi> 
                     <note n="n" place="margin"> 2 King 9. 22</note> So when Death comes like <hi>Iehu</hi> marching furiously against you, and you enquire of him, whither he comes with <hi>peace</hi> or no, hee will answer <hi>what peace, when your whoredomes,</hi> and your grosse and crying sinnes are yet in great number? <hi>What peace,</hi> when these make a partition betwixt your soules and the Lord? Certainly there can be no <hi>peace,</hi> but a fearefull <hi>expectation of judgement, and violent fire to devoure</hi> 
                     <note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 10. 24.</note>. Suffer me then to conclude this exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Daniel</hi> did his speech to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar; O King, breake off thy sinnes by righteousnesse, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poore</hi> 
                     <note n="p" place="margin">Dan. 4. 27.</note>. So say I, <hi>breake off your sinnes</hi> by repentance, your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by seeking after knowledge, your contempt of Gods word by a reverent yeelding to it, your securitie by a <hi>standing in awe of God;</hi> your neglecting the exercises of Religion by carefull using of them; your whoredome by chastitie, your drunkennesse by sobrietie; your malice by charitie; your oppression by mercy; your falshood by fidelitie; this is the way that will bring <hi>peace</hi> at the last, thus, and thus onely you may <hi>find rest for your soules.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese words that I have read to you, they are part of the conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Martha,</hi> and Christ, when Christ was comming to <hi>Bethanie</hi> to awake <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the sleepe of death. The conference is laid downe from the beginning of the 21. verse, to the end of the 27. and <hi>Martha</hi> mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with Christ begins the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as wee may see vers. 21. 22. <hi>Then said Martha to Iesus, Lord if thou haddest beene here my brother had not died: but I know that even now whatsoever thou wilt aske of God, God will give it thee.</hi> Here <hi>Martha</hi> manifests her affection to her dead brother, and her faith in her living Master: shee manifests the strength of her naturall affection, and the weaknesse and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of her faith. The strength of her naturall affection ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in this, that she was perswaded if Christ had beene there
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:14764:342"/>
present, her brother <hi>Lazarus</hi> had not died, he would not have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>Lazarus</hi> to have died: which for ought wee know is more then she had sufficient ground for. Then the weaknesse, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of her faith appeares in this, that shee rested too much upon the corporall presence of Christ, that shee ascribed no more powerto Christ, then that by his prayer he could attaine at Gods hands as much as ever any holy man did; namely, the life of her brother. I know, saith she, that <hi>even now whatsoever thou askest, God will give it;</hi> Whereas Christ being true God, was able to worke any miracle by his owne power.</p>
                  <p>Now the answer of Christ is laid downe verse 23. <hi>Iesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise againe.</hi> Christ, to comfort <hi>Martha,</hi> passeth by her infirmitie, and promiseth to her, that hee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store her brother to life againe, that shee shall enjoy her brother againe: but this promise is only laid downe in generall and indifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite termes; <hi>Thy brother shall rise againe.</hi> Christ doth not say ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, I will raise up thy brother to life, but hee speakes only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generall termes, <hi>Thy brother shall rise againe:</hi> which wee are to ascribe to the modestie, and humilitie, that alwais may bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the speeches of Christ; <hi>Thy brother shall rise againe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then we have the replie of <hi>Martha,</hi> laid downe in verse 24. <hi>Martha</hi> said unto him, <hi>I know hee shall rise againe in the Resurrection, at the last day. Martha</hi> was not satisfied with this promise of Christ: for it seemes shee durst not take it in the full extent of it, therefore shee replyes, that as for the last Resurrection shee knew indeed, that her brother, and all others that were dead, should then rise againe, this did comfort her: but for any other matter of comfort shee could not gather any from the answer of Christ, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: therefore Christ replies againe in the words of my Text, <hi>And Iesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life, hee that beleeves in mee, though hee were dead, yet shall hee live, and whosoever liveth and beleeveth in me shall never die.</hi> Christ would have <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> know that hee was true life, yea, the fountaine of all life, and such a fountaine of life, that whosoever did beleeve in him, and cleave to him, nothing should hurt him, no not Death it selfe. Thus you see briefly the coherence, and the scope of the words. We come now to shew you the meaning of them.</p>
                  <p>In these words we may observe these two parts. <note place="margin">Parts of the Text.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, here we have laid downe a compound proposition.</p>
                  <p>And then the distinct Exposition, or explication thereof.</p>
                  <p>First, here wee have laid downe a compound Axiome, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, a copulative Proposition, wherein Christ affirmes two things of himselfe.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>I am the Resurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>I am the Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="695" facs="tcp:14764:342"/>
I am the Resurrection, I am the Life. Now the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene these two, wee may conceive with reverend <hi>Calvin</hi> to be this;
<q>I am the Resurrection.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, I have all quickening power in mee, I am able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store, and give life to those that are dead. And then <hi>I am the life;</hi> I have such quickening power in mee, that I am able to preserve, and continue the life that I have given, or restored to any; <hi>I am the Resurrection and the life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then followes the Exposition of this Proposition, and of the severall members of it: for the truth of a copulative Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depends upon the truth of both the parts and members of it, therefore there followes the Explication, and confirmation of both the parts of this Proposition.</p>
                  <p>First of the first part, <hi>I am the Resurrection,</hi> this is explained, and confirmed in these words; <hi>Hee that beleeveth in mee, though hee were dead, yet shall hee live.</hi> I have such a quickning power in mee, saith Christ, that I am able to restore spirituall life to that soule that is dead in sinnes, therefore I am able to raise up the body that is dead in the grave; I am able to give spirituall life to the soule, which is greater, and the more difficult worke; and if I be able to doe the greater, I am able to doe the lesse: hee that <hi>beleeves in mee,</hi> saith Christ, though before he were dead in trespasses and sinnes, <hi>yet hee shall live,</hi> he shall live the life of grace.</p>
                  <p>Then followes the Explication and confirmation of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond member of the Proposition in these words, <hi>Whosoever liveth, and beleeveth in mee, shall never die.</hi> I am the life saith Christ, for whosoever beleeveth in me, and so is restored to spirituall life, he shall <hi>never die;</hi> hee shall never die, to speake properly, for he shall never perish: he shall never die, this life shall never be taken from him, neither here nor hereafter; not here, for hee shall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to live the life of grace: not hereafter, for though the body shall die, yet this separation of the body from the soule, it is not so properly a death, as a passage to life; a passage from the life of grace, to the life of glory. And this body also that is separated from the soule, it shall bee quickned againe, and shall be raised up to live for ever, therefore <hi>hee that beleeveth in mee, shall never die.</hi> Thus you see the words expounded.</p>
                  <p>Now from the first member of this Proposition, <hi>I am the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection;</hi> and the Exposition, and confirmation of it in these words, <hi>Hee that beleeveth in mee, though hee were dead, yet shall he live.</hi> Hence the point of Doctrine I will observe is this, that</p>
                  <p>Iesus Christ is the Fountaine, and Authour of all life. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Iesus Christ, the Fountain, and Author of all life.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee is able to give and restore life to those that are dead; He is
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:14764:343"/>
the Resurrection. Now, whereas there is a double death, and a double Life, and consequently a double Resurrection; we must understand that Christ is the Author of both: in this place weare not to exclude either. Therefore wee will indeavour to expound this generall doctrine in these three particulars.</p>
                  <p>First, Christ hath such a quickning power in him, that hee is able to raise up those dead bodies of his, that now lie in the Grave.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Christ hath such a quickning power in him, that he is able to raise up the soule that is dead in sinnes, to a spirituall life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wee will shew you why Christ, as in this place, so else-where doth expresse both the state of the faithfull here, and their estate after, under the same phrase of speech, he comprehends both under this terme, <hi>I am the Resurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the first of these, Christ is the Author of life, he hath such a quickning power in him, that hee is able to raise up the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of his out of their graves. Wee will speake first of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection that is of the body, though it be later in time; Because that naturally we are more apt to conceive of the death, and life of the body, then of the death and life of the soule. And second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because that the understanding of this Resurrection of the body, will give light to the understanding of the other, of the soule.</p>
                  <p>And here first wee will shew briefly what this Resurrection of the body is.</p>
                  <p>And then prove that Christ is the Author, and the Fountaine <note place="margin">1. Of the body.</note> of it.</p>
                  <p>First, the Resurrection of the body is this, when the soule that was actually separate from the dead body, returnes againe to <note place="margin">Resurrection of the body what.</note> its proper body, and being united to it, the man riseth up out of the Grave, with an immortall, incorruptible body to lead a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified life. This is the Resurrection of the body.</p>
                  <p>Now that Christ is the Author of this Resurrection of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it is evident: For as Christ himselfe by his owne power, raised himselfe being dead in the Grave, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 19. saith Christ, <hi>destroy</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh 2. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>this Temple, and in three dayes I will raise it againe,</hi> speaking of the Temple of his body. And so againe, <hi>Iohn 10. 18. I have power,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 18.</note> saith Christ, <hi>to lay downe my life, and to take it up againe:</hi> so likewise Christ by his quickning spirit, hee will raise up the bodyes of those that are now dead in the Grave, as we may see <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 28, 29. <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 28, 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Mervaile not at this,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>for the houre is comming in which all that are in the grave, shall heare the voyce of the Sonne of man, and shall come forth, they that have done good to the resurrection of life,</hi> &amp;c. In this regard Christ is called the <hi>first fruites of them that sleepe.</hi> For as <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 20.</note> the first fruites being offered to God, did sanctifie the whole crop;
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:14764:343"/>
and the owner hereby was assured of the blessing of God upon all the rest: so Christ is the first fruits of the dead, and his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection it is an assurance to the faithfull of their Resurrection, and the cause of it: both an assurance, a pledge of it, and likewise a cause of it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore herein Christ the second <hi>Adam</hi> is opposed to the first <hi>Adam:</hi> As the first <hi>Adam</hi> who was the roote of all man-kind did communicate death, and mortalitie to all those that spring from him: so likewise Christ the second <hi>Adam</hi> by his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee conveyes life, and a quickening power to all his members, as wee may see 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 21, 22. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead: for as in Adam all die; Adam</hi> he communicates death and mortalitie to all that spring from him; <hi>even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</hi> Christ hee conveyes life to all his members, and they are all quickened by his Spirit; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ is called a quickning spirit, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 45. The first Adam was made a living soule, but the last Adam a quickning spirit;</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a living, but a quickning spirit. And this quickning power and vertue, Christ did manifest before his resurrection, by raising up three from death, namely, by raising the Widowes sonne, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. and <hi>Iairus</hi> his Daughter, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. and <hi>Lazarus</hi> here in this chapter, And at his resurrection also hee manifested this his quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power, in that he rose not alone, but raised the bodies of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Saints with him, many of his Saints arose with him, and as they rose with Christ their head, so also they ascended to glory together with Christ their head, and the resurrection of these it was an effect of the resurrection of Christ, it was by the power of Christs resurrection. Of these we may reade <hi>Mat. 27. 52. 53. The graves opened, and many bodies of the Saints that slept arose,</hi> and came out of their graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy Citie and appeared to many. Thus you have the first conclusion proved, that Christ is the Author of the resurrection of the body.</p>
                  <p>Now in the next place, the second conclusion is this, that</p>
                  <p>Christ is the Author and Fountaine of spirituall life also. <note place="margin">2. Of spirituall life.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee is the Author of the Resurrection of the soule; and the resurrection of the soule it is this, when the Spirit of grace, (of which we were all deprived in <hi>Adam)</hi> returnes againe to the soule of a naturall man, and so quickens the man, that the man begins to rise out of the Grave of sinne, and to lead a new life, a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life, the life of grace: this is the resurrection of the soule.</p>
                  <p>Now that Christ is the Author of this Resurrection also, of this spirituall Resurrection: wee may demonstrate this by a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Divine testimonies, but wee will single out some few of the chiefe, wee need goe no further then this Evangelist which
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:14764:344"/>
affords plentifull testimonie for the confirmation of this truth: As in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 10. There Christ speaking to the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 10.</note> he said unto her; <hi>If thou haddest knowne the gift of God, and who it is that said unto thee give me drinke, thou shouldest have asked of him, and hee would have given thee living water.</hi> Here the Spirit of Christ it is compared to living water, by an allusion to the water that continually springeth out of a Fountaine. And the Spirit of grace is compared to living water from the effects of it: because the Spirit of grace restoreth spirituall life to the soule, and then preserveth this life; therefore it is living Water, and Christ is as the Fountaine of this water that yeeldeth, and giveth this living, quickning water of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Againe in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 21. there Christ chalengeth this power to himselfe, <hi>As the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickneth them; so</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>the Sonne quickneth whom hee will.</hi> As Christ when he was upon the earth, hee raised whom he would from the death of the body, so now being in heaven, hee raiseth whom he will from the death of the soule. Yea, the voyce of Christ sounding in the ministrie of the Word, accompanied with his quickning Spirit, is of power and efficacie to raise those that are dead in sinnes, as wee may see <hi>Ioh. 5. 25. Verily, verily, I say unto you,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>the houre is</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>comming, and now is, when the dead shall heare the voyce of the Sonne of God, and they that heare it shall live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 35. there Christ stileth himselfe the Bread of life, and the Living bread; <hi>Iesus said unto them, I am the bread of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 35.</note> 
                     <hi>life;</hi> and in verse 48. <hi>I am the bread of life;</hi> and againe verse 51. <hi>I am the living bread.</hi> Christ is the living bread, the bread of life, who as he hath life in himselfe, so he communicates spirituall life to all those that feed upon him. And here is a broad diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene this Bread of life, and ordinary bread, ordinarie food: for though ordinarie food can preserve naturall life where it is, yet it cannot restore life where it is not: but Christ is such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Bread, that he restores life to those that are dead in sinnes, and preserves that life that hee hath restored, thus hee is the living Bread.</p>
                  <p>Againe <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 1. there Christ compares himselfe to a Vine, and the faithfull to so many branches; <hi>I am the true Vine,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>and my Father is the husband-man.</hi> And in verse 5. <hi>I am the Vine, yee</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 1. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>are the branches.</hi> Now as the branch of the Vine sucks juyce and sappe from the stocke and roote of the vine; so all the faithfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive spirituall juyce and life, from Christ their head. As <hi>Adam</hi> hee is a common root of corruption, and spirituall death to all that come from him; so Christ is a common roote of grace, and spirituall life to all those that are his members. And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Christ is compared to a head, and the faithfull to his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:14764:344"/>
                     <hi>Collos. 1. 18. Christ is the head of his body the Church.</hi> Christ is <note place="margin">Coll. 1. 18.</note> the head; and the faithfull are his members: therefore as in the naturall body, the head that is the <hi>principium,</hi> the fountaine of sense and motion: it is the head that by certaine nerves and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes conveyes sense and motion to all the members of the body: so in the mysticall body the Church, Christ is the head that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyes spirituall life and motion, to all that are his members, to all the faithfull. Thus you see the second conclusion explained and proved also, that as Christ is the Author of the resurrection of the body, so hee is of the resurrection of the soule too, it is he that raiseth the soule to spirituall life.</p>
                  <p>Now in the third place we are to shew you the reason why <note place="margin">3. Why both comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under one terme.</note> this double quickning power is here comprehended under one terme, <hi>I am the Resurrection.</hi> Now that this double power of quickening, is to be understood here under this one terme, wee need not, I hope, spend time to prove: for that Christ speakes here of the spirituall resurrection, and the spirituall life; this I take to be evident from Christs owne exposition in the words following; <hi>Hee that beleeveth in mee, though hee were dead, yet shall hee live:</hi> Hee that beleeveth in me, though he were dead in sinnes and trespasses before, yet hee shall live the life of grace, therefore I am the Resurrection.</p>
                  <p>Againe, that the resurrection of the body is not here excluded, it may appeare from the scope and intent of these words of Christ: for the scope of these words here, is to perswade <hi>Martha</hi> that hee was able of himselfe, by his owne power to raise up her dead bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to restore him to life, saith hee, <hi>I am the resurrection,</hi> I have power to restore spirituall life to the soule that is dead in sinne, and this is the greater worke; therefore I am able to restore natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life to the dead body, to restore the body that is dead in the Grave to life againe.</p>
                  <p>Now the reasons why this double power is here comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under one terme, <hi>I am the Resurrection;</hi> the chiefe reasons I take to bee these two.</p>
                  <p>First, this double quickning power is here comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one terme, in regard of the Analogie, and proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene these two, betweene the restoring of the body to life, and the restoring the soule to life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of the certaine inseparable connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene these two.</p>
                  <p>First, I say in regard of the Analogie and proportion betweene <note place="margin">1. In regard of the Analogie.</note> these two, the resurrection of the body, and of the soule; now the proportion and analogie consists especially in these foure things.</p>
                  <p>First, as in the resurrection of the body, the living soule must
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:14764:345"/>
first returne to the dead body, and quicken it before it can rise againe: so here in the Resurrection of the soule, the Spirit of grace must returne to the soule that is dead in sinnes, and quicken it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for it can rise againe: so that there is a similitude in regard of the first beginning, and principle of this Resurrection.</p>
                  <p>Againe, secondly there is an analogie, and proportion, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <note place="margin">2.</note> of the point and terme, the state from which the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is: for as in the resurrection of the body, the body riseth from the state of corruption, from the bondage of the Grave; so here in this resurrection of the soule, the soule and the whole man ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from the state of spirituall corruption, from the bondage of sinne.</p>
                  <p>The third proportion is in regard of the estate to which a man riseth: for as in the resurrection of the body, a man shall rise <note place="margin">3.</note> againe without those infirmities that the body had before, he shall rise to lead another kind of life, a glorified life: so in this resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the soule the sinner riseth, and is raised up to lead a new kind of life, a spirituall life: and therefore it is called <hi>Newnesse of life, Rom.</hi> 6. 4. that we should <hi>walke in newnesse of life:</hi> both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <note place="margin">Rom: 6: 4.</note> of the new principle, and fountaine of it, the spring of grace in the soule. And in regard of the new effects, and new ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which are answerable to the new roote.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, there is a proportion also in regard of the perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">4.</note> of both: for as in the Resurrection of the body, the body shall rise an immortall body, not subject to death any more; so here in the resurrection of the soule, when the sinner is restored to spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life, he is raised up to a durable immutable estate, hee shall continue to live this life of grace, and the immortall seed that is put into him, it shall never die: so Christ saith verse 26. <hi>Hee that beleeveth in mee,</hi> saith he, and so liveth, <hi>hee shall never die;</hi> he is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to an immutable estate, to such a life as shall never be subject to spirituall death againe. Thus you see the analogie, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between these two, and in this respect they may both be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended fitly under one terme.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of the infallible connexion betweene these <note place="margin">2. In regard of the connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> two: for wheresoever the resurrection of the soule to the life of grace goes before, there the resurrection of the body to the life of glorie will certainly follow after: for as the spirituall death of the soule did necessarily draw after it the mortalitie, and death of the body, so the spirituall life of the soule doth necessarily draw with it the immortalitie, and the resurrection of the body: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as in the Sacrament the name of the thing signified, is given to the signe, in regard of the neere conjunction, and relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them: so here in regard of the neere conjunction betweene these two, that they are never separate, therefore they may both
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:14764:345"/>
fitly be comprehended under one terme. Thus wee have ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to expound the general doctrine in these three particulars. Wee have shewed you that Christ is the Author and fountaine of the Resurrection of the body: hee hath the quickning power in him whereby he is able to raise those bodyes that are dead in the grave. Then he is the Author of the Resurrection of the soule too; he is able to quicken those soules that are dead in sinnes. And then we have shewed the reasons why these two, the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body, and of the soule, are both comprehended under one phrase of speech, <hi>I am the Resurrection.</hi> Now I come to the Use and Application of that, that hath beene delivered. And the Use of the point is</p>
                  <p>First, for comfort.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for tryall and examination.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for exhortation, and direction.</p>
                  <p>First, the Use of the point may be for comfort here, here is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Comfort.</note> of sound comfort to all those that are the faithfull members of Christ Jesus: if thou be united to Christ by faith, Christ is the Fountaine of life, he will be the Fountaine of spirituall life: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here is comfort against Death, against the death of the soule, and against the death of the body.</p>

If thou be united to Christ; Christ by his divine power he is able to free thee from the power and dominion of sinne, from the bondage of sinne.

                     <hi>flesh.</hi> Dost thou complaine that thy affections are unruly, and set upon wrong objects? remember to thy comfort, that Christ is able to rectifie these affections, hee is able to plant in thee the true love, and feare of God, as he hath promised, <hi>Deut. 30. 6. I will cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcise</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 30. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>thy heart, and the heart of thy seed; that thou shalt love mee with all thy heart, and with all thy soule.</hi> And in <hi>Ier. 32. 40. I will put</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 32. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>my feare in their hearts, that they shall never depart from mee.</hi> Dost thou complaine that thou canst not beare afflictions patiently? remember that Christ thy head, he is able to strengthen thee, and hee will doe it, as he did the Apostle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 13. saith he, <hi>I am able to doe all things through Christ that strengtheneth me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here the weake Christian will bee ready to object: but I <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> have so many strong corruptions in me that I am afaid, that I am
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:14764:346"/>
not yet raised out of the grave of sinne, that I am not yet raised out of my naturall estate.</p>
                  <p>To which I answer, remember this to thy comfort that the first Resurrection is unlike to the second in this regard; in regard <note place="margin">Answ.</note> of the measure and degree of it: as soone as ever the soule quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the dead body, the dead body leaves the Grave, and the state of corruption wholly, and all at once; but it is not so in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the soule. When the spirit quickens the soule, the soule begins to rise againe from the grave of sinne, but yet the bands and fetters of sinne, and corruption still remaine upon the sould. Indeed as soone as the Spirit of grace quickens the soule, the soule presently hates all sinne, and begins to shake off these fetters of sinne and corruption, and shakes them off by little and little; but I say, it shakes them not off all at once. In this spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Resurrection, sinne indeed receives a deadly wound, but yet it is not wholly abolished. In the spirituall Resurrection sinne is like a beast, whose throat is cut, that lies striving and strugling for life: so sinne hath life in it, but yet it hath a deadly wound: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remember to thy comfort, that that will bee true here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the power of grace, and the remainders of sinne, that is affirmed of the house of <hi>Saul,</hi> and the house of <hi>David, 2 Sam.</hi> 3. 1. <note place="margin">2. Sam. 3. 1.</note> there was long warre betweene them, <hi>But the house of David grew stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</hi> So it will be betweene sinne and grace, sinne will grow weaker, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and grace stronger and stronger.</p>
                  <p>But yet the weake Christian may object further: but I feele the spirit so weake in me, and the flesh so strong in me, that I am afraid <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> the flesh will prevaile, and so I shall returne againe to my naturall estate.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer, remember that this is contrarie to the nature of a true Resurrection to returne to death againe: for at the last <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Resurrection, the bodyes that are raised shall be immortall, never to die againe: so here those soules that are quickned to the life of grace, they are raised to a durable, immutable, immortall estate never to die againe. That which Christ saith of those that shall bee accounted worthie to attaine the second Resurrection; the Resurrection of the body, it is true here also: hee saith those that shall be accounted worthy of the world to come, of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to life, they shall never die: for they are as the <hi>Angels of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Luke</hi> 20. 35, 36. Those that partake of that Resurrection can <note place="margin">Luk. 20. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>, 36.</note> never die: so here those that partake of this spirituall Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the life of grace, they shall never die: this Resurrection to the life of grace it shall continue in them. For the Spirit of grace when he once commeth into the soule, and quickens it, it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues there, and remaines there for ever: it is as a <hi>Well of water
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:14764:346"/>
springing up to eternall life,</hi> as Christ speakes <hi>Ioh. 4. 14. Whosoever shall drinke of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him, shall bee in him a well of water springing up to everlasting life.</hi> Now wee know a streame of water is of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing nature, yet if it bee nourished with a continuall Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that can never be drie, the streame will continually runne: so it is with the streame of grace in the soule, it is nourished with a continuall fountaine, such a one as can never be dried up. Thus you see here is comfort against sinne, against the death of the soule. Those that are united to Christ by faith, they may be assured that Christ will be to them a Fountaine of spirituall life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here is comfort against the death of the body, against <note place="margin">2. Against the death of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>odie.</note> naturall death. If thou be united to Christ, thou needest not to feare temporall death, remember that though <hi>the body bee dead bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of sinne, yet the spirit is life,</hi> as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10. The body, that <note place="margin">Rom 8. 10.</note> is dead; that is, it is mortall and subject to death because of sinne, but the spirit, the soule, that liveth, it passeth from the life of grace here, to the life of glorie. Yea, and the body too that is laid in the Grave, notwithstanding shall be raised againe by the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power of Christ. Remember Christ is thy head, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee being risen from the dead, thou shalt not perish. You know as long as the head of the naturall body is above the water, none of the members of the body can be drowned: so it is here, as long as Christ is risen, none of his members can be held captive in the Grave. Remember, Christ is the first fruites of the dead, <hi>the first fruites of them that sleepe:</hi> therefore his Resurrection may bee a pledge, and an assurance to thee of thy resurrection; <hi>As wee have borne the Image of the earthly,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>so wee shall beare the Image of the heavenly, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 49. As wee have borne about <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 49.</note> us these corruptible bodyes, so when we rise againe, we shall rise with immortall, and incorruptible bodies, and live a glorious life with Christ, and so be made conformable to Christ our head, therefore feare not the death of the body. Remember that Death can destroy nothing in thee but sinne, therefore feare not.</p>
                  <p>This consideration may comfort us, as against our owne death, so against the death of our friends; Let us therefore receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort hence, as <hi>Martha</hi> in this Chapter; <hi>I know that my brother shall rise againe in the Resurrection at the last day,</hi> and that did comfort her.</p>
                  <p>But here this question may bee demanded; but is not this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection <note place="margin">Quest.</note> of the body, a benefit common to the wicked? are not they partakers of this benefit from the resurrection of Christ, as well as the godly? shall not they be raised, and quickned, as well <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Difference in the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the godly, and wicked.</note> as the godly, by Christ his Resurrection?</p>
                  <p>To this I answer, that this Resurrection of the body to life, it is a benefit proper to the faithfull, to the true members of Christ:
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:14764:347"/>
for though unbeleevers, and wicked persons shall bee raised up againe, yet</p>
                  <p>By a different cause.</p>
                  <p>And to a different end.</p>
                  <p>I say first, by a different cause: the wicked that are out of Christ, cannot have any benefit from the Resurrection of Christ, <note place="margin">1. In the cause.</note> because they are out of Christ, therefore they shall bee raised in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; but not by a quickning power flowing from the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ: but by the divine power, and command of Christ, as a just Judge: and they shall bee raised by vertue of that curse pronounced in Paradice, <hi>Gen. 2. In the day thou eatest, thou shalt die the death;</hi> that includes eternall death: therefore this curse must be executed upon them, and therefore they most rise out of the Grave againe, that body and soule may die eternally: but the faithfull members of Christ shall bee raised by the quickning power of Christ, as their head and Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Againe, as the wicked shall be raised by a different cause, so to <note place="margin">2. In the end.</note> a different end: for they shall not be raised to life to speake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, that state is stiled eternall death, therefore their Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is stiled <hi>the resurrection of condemnation, Ioh. 5. 27. they that have done good shall come forth to the resurrection of life, and they that have</hi>

                     <hi>done ill to the resurrection of condemnation;</hi> they shall not rise to life, but to eternall death: but the godly only shall attaine this Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of life, and therefore they only are stiled the <hi>sonnes of the</hi>

                     <hi>resurrection, Luke</hi> 20. 36. So much may suffice for comfort.</p>
                  <p>A second Use of the point may be for tryall and examination, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Tryall.</note> since we professe to be Christians, to be members of Christ: let us here trie the truth, whether wee be so indeed or no. Christ is the Resurrection: he is the Author of the first Resurrection to a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life. The first thing that Christ doth in the soule of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is to raise the soule to a spirituall life: therefore examine whether thou have feltthis quickning power or no, this first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection to a spirituall life. When Christ was upon the earth, he had power to raise up all those to life againe that died, but yet hee raised but few; there are but three that wee read of, those that we named before. The Widowes sonne, <hi>Iairus</hi> Daughter, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> here. So likewise Christ now hath power to quicken all those that are dead in sinne, to raise them to spirituall life, but yet he quickens but few, in comparison of those that continue still in their sinnes. Therefore let us all examine our selves upon this point, whether we have attained the first Resurrection or no. If we be true members of Christ, we partake of the first Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for Christ is a fountaine of spirituall life to all his members: therefore examine this, looke to the first resurrection, to the Life of grace, thou maist know it briefly by three signes.</p>

As in the Resurrection of the body, as soone as the soule is united to the body, presently the man leaves the Grave, he leaves the societie of the dead and comes forth: as <hi>Lazarus</hi> as soone as he was quickned, and his soule retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his body, presently hee came forth, Vers. 44. <hi>Hee that was dead came forth out of his grave.</hi> Examine therefore whether thou be come forth of the grave of sinne? whether hast thou left the societie of sinners, of prophane persons? and whether hast thou left the grave of thy sinne? Is there not some lust, some sinne that still holds thee captive in this Grave, to which thou willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and wittingly obeyest? If thou live in any one knowne sinne, if thou be ruled by any one lust, whatsoever it be, be it swearing, or drunkennesse, or uncleannesse, or covetousnesse, or lying, or open and publike prophaning of the Sabbath. I say, if thou live in the practice of any of these, or the like knowne sins, this is a plaine case, thou art still in the noysome grave of thy sinnes: thou art not risen out of the grave of thy sinnes, and therefore thou art not quickned by the Spirit of Christ; and if thou art not quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then thou art not a member of Christ, thou art not a true Christian.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Secondly thou mayest know it by the newnesse of thy life: whether dost thou feele a spirituall life wrought in thee? <note place="margin">2. Newnesse of life.</note> and whether doth it appeare outwardly? Dost thou feele a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life wrought inwardly? That spirituall life that Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores to the soule, is universally spread through the whole foule. As when the soule of a man quickens the body, it quickens the whole body, every member of it; so here the Spirit of grace quickens the whole soule. Therefore examine whether dost thou find spirituall life wrought in thy whole soule or no? whether dost thou find this change wrought in thy understanding and judgement? whether hast thou a new judgement, and thoughts, and opinion of God, and of the wayes of God? a new opinion of Christ? a new opinion of the members of Christ? Whether dost thou find this change in thy heart and affections? whether hast thou new desires, new affections, spirituall inclinations? whether are the studies, and desires of thy soule set upon heavenly things? <hi>If yee bee risen with Christ, seeke those things that are above, Collos.</hi> 3. 1. Whether are thy affections and meditations heavenly <note place="margin">Collos. 3. 1.</note> and spirituall? Dost thou feele this change inwardly in thy soule?</p>
                  <p>Againe, doth this spirituall life appeare outwardly also by thy
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:14764:348"/>
speeches and actions? Doth it appeare outwardly in thy speeches, is there a change there? canst thou now speake to men in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to God in the voyce of his Spirit crying <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, Father?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, is there a change in thy outward actions? hast thou left the societie of sinners? and dost thou converse with living Christians? Dost thou love those that excell in vertue? and dost thou manifest the graces of the Spirit in the conscionable perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all the duties of thy generall, and particular calling? As soone as <hi>Lazarus</hi> was quickned, presently as he left the Grave, so he conversed with living men, and walked in his Calling: so examine if thou have left the societie of the dead, and converse with living Christians, and delight in them; and whether thou walke on conscionably in the place that God hath set thee in, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the word of Christ the rule of all thy actions. If it bee thus with thee, if thou feele this spirituall life wrought in thy soule, and it appeare outwardly in all thy speeches and actions, this is a good signe thou partakest of the first Resurrection to the life of grace.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, thou maist know this also by thy progresse in <note place="margin">3. Progresse in both.</note> both these. First, by the progresse of thy Mortification: Is sinne daily more and more mortified in thee? Dost thou daily get ground of thy corruptions? Is sinne in thee like the house of <hi>Saul,</hi> as that waxed weaker and weaker, so doth corruption in thee daily? Is sinne in thee like an old man, as it is in every member of Christ? and therefore it is stiled the old man: an old man growes weaker, and weaker, till at the last he dies: so it is with sin in every Christian, examine if sin be such an old man in you, that it growes weaker daily.</p>
                  <p>Againe, thou maist know it by thy progresse in thy vivificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Dost thou grow in grace daily? Is grace in thee, as the house of <hi>David,</hi> as that grew stronger and stronger, so doth grace in thee? Is grace like a young man, as it is in every member of Christ? and therefore it is stiled the <hi>New man:</hi> because it is as a young and lustie man that daily growes stronger, till he come to his full strength, doth grace in thee grow stronger daily? and dost thou goe forward in thy Christian course? It is the dutie of a Christian to walke on daily in his Christian course, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 4.</note> wee must walke on in <hi>newnesse of life.</hi> If thou find this progresse in thy mortification, and vivification, it is a good signe indeed that thou hast attained to the first Resurrection of the soule, to a spirituall life. Therefore let mee intreate you to set upon this worke of examination of your owne hearts diligently, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Let not the multitudes of worldly businesse: let not the allurement of vaine objects, and vain companie; let not the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:14764:348"/>
and desire of base pleasures drive these thoughts out of your heads: but examine your owne hearts whether you partake of the first Resurrection, or no. Deceive not thy owne soule: for though conscience may now sleepe, thou mayst thinke thou art in a good estate; yet let me tell thee, the time will come when thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will awake, that if thou continue to wallow in any one sin, if there be no change in thee in thy life, in thy heart; if in stead of growing better, thou grow worse, and bee hardned more and more in sinfull courses, thy conscience will tell thee to thy face, thou art a dead man, thou hast no part in Christ: for Christ is the Resurrection, the Fountaine of spirituall life: thou hast not yet attained the first Resurrection to the life of grace, and therefore if thou goe on in this course, thou shalt not attaine to the second Resurrection to the life of glory. So much for that Use.</p>
                  <p>The third, and the last Use of the point is for exhortation, and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Exhortation, direction.</note> direction. If now upon examination, thou find that thou hast not yet attained to this spirituall Resurrection; then let me counsel thee to give no rest to thy soule, till thou hast attained it: for remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that this is the first step to heaven, and if thou set not the first steppe to heaven, surely thou shalt never come thither. As the Resurrection of Christ was the first degree of his exaltation: so this spirituall Resurrection that we have spoken of, it is the first degree of a Christians exaltation: therefore get this in the first place; yea, get this, and all will follow. If thou attaine this, thou maist be assured of the second Resurrection also, to the life of glory. Remember that Christ by raising himselfe from the dead by his owne power, declared himselfe to be the eternall Sonne of God: <hi>Hee was declared mightily to bee the Sonne of God by his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:</hi> So if thou canst by a power and vertue drawne from Christ, rise out of the grave of thy sinne, then thou shalt declare thy selfe to bee the member of Christ, the Sonne of God, the daughter of God: therefore labour to attaine this first Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                  <p>But here this question may be demanded: but by what meanes <note place="margin">Quest.</note> now doth Christ convey this spirituall life to his children? and how shall I get to bee partaker of this Resurrection? by what meanes shall I attaine this first Resurrection to this spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life?</p>
                  <p>To this I answer briefly, that by the same meanes by which <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Christ workes faith in the soule, by the same meanes hee raiseth a sinner to life: for he that beleeveth liveth, and he that liveth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth; hee that beleeveth is raised to life: therefore by the same meanes that Christ workes faith, by the same meanes he raiseth a sinner to life. Therefore the outward meanes is the Preaching of the Word; the inward, the Spirit of grace. By such meanes
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:14764:349"/>
as Christ will raise the bodies of the dead at the last day, by the like meanes hee now raiseth the soules of those that are dead in sinne. Now Christ will raise the bodyes that are now dead in the Grave, at the last day. First, by his voyce, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 28, 29. and by the sound of the Trumpet, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 52. The Trump shall sound,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 28, 29. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Cor. 15. 52.</note> 
                     <hi>and the dead shall be raised incorruptible.</hi> And hee shall raise them by his quickning Spirit. So by the like meanes Christ now raiseth our soules that are dead in sinnes: therefore if thou desire to bee raised out of the grave of sinne, let me counsell thee,</p>
                  <p>First, to attend diligently to the word of God, upon the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell. The word of Christ, is a quickning word, as Christ saith, <hi>Ioh. 3. 63. My Word is spirit and life.</hi> The voyce <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 63.</note> of Christ is a quickning voyce: as Christ by his voyce raised <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> out of his Grave; when Christ said to <hi>Lazarus, Come forth;</hi> presently <hi>Lazarus</hi> quickned, and came forth: so the voyce of Christ in the ministerie of the Word hath a quickning power, to raise sinners from the death of sinne: therefore when the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters crie aloude, and the Prophets <hi>lift up their voyce as a Trumpet,</hi> then hearken.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, be frequent, and fervent in Prayer for the Spirit of of grace, and of Christ: before thou heare, pray; and after thou hast heard, pray that the Spirit of Christ may accompany his Word, that so this may be a meanes to awaken, and to quicken thee out of thy naturall estate, and to raise thee out of the death of sinne. Thou must pray to God to give thee a hearing eare, and a beleeving heart: that so the sound of the Word may not be as the sound of a Trumpet in the eares of a dead man, but that thou mayst be quickned by the voyce of Christ. And though thou have continued a long time in thy sinnes, yet bee not altogether discouraged: remember that Christ is able to raise thee, though thou have continued never so long in thy sinnes: for hee that was able to raise <hi>Lazarus</hi> that was dead and buried, and now stinking in the Grave, he is able to raise up thee also.</p>
                  <p>In the last place (in one word) if upon examination, thou find thou have attained to this spirituall Resurrection, then here is a ground of exhortation, To <list>
                        <item>humilitie.</item>
                        <item>thankfulnesse.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is a ground of Exhortation to Humilitie and Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to joyne them both together, because they usually goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: the proud person is alway unthankfull; and the humble man is alway a thankfull man. Now if thou have attained to this Resurrection, thou hast great cause to be humble, and to bee thankfull.</p>
                  <p>First, thou hast great cause to bee humbled, because thou hast
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:14764:349"/>
nothing but that thou hast received: thou hast great cause to bee humbled, because thou puttest not any hand to this worke, no more than the dead body of <hi>Lazarus</hi> could helpe to the raising of him. No more then a creature being nothing, can helpe to its owne creation; no more can a sinner helpe forward this worke of his Resurrection, therefore thou hast cause to be humbled for not putting the least helping hand to this worke, it is wholly su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall. Therefore let not any one arrogate any thing to the power of his free-will, but remember the worke is wholly super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as we have cause to be humbled, so to be thankfull too, doe but consider the desperate, and dangerous estate of sinne whence thou art raised, and then make thy humble confession with the Israelites, when they brought their first fruites before God, <hi>Deut. 26. 5. A Syrian ready to perish was my father; hee went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 26. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Egypt with a few;</hi> and became a Nation mightie, and populous, and the Lord brought him out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with a mighty hand, and an out-stretched arme, with terrour and signes, and wonders, and hath brought us to this place, and hath given us this Land, even a Land flowing with milke, and honey. The like deliverance the Lord hath wrought for thee, therefore bee thankfull, and make thy thankfull acknowledgement with the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 115. <hi>Not</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 115.</note> 
                     <hi>unto us, but to thy Name give the glorie.</hi> And then desire God, as he hath by his mercie brought thee to the Kingdome of grace, so by his power to preserve thee to the Kingdome of glorie. And desire Christ, as he by his quickning Spirit, hath made thee partakers of the first Resurrection to the life of grace; so to make thee partaker of the second to the life of glorie.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a statute law of God, that all, both men, and women must die. The causes for which it pleased Almightie God to leave the bodies, even of his dearest children <note place="margin">All men must die.</note> under the power of Death, to be returned to dust are many.</p>
                  <p>First, for the manifesting his truth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ancient threatning men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <note place="margin">1. To manifest Gods truth. Gen. 3. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Genesis 3. 19. Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt returne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the manifestation of his power, that by death, hee may translate his chosen servants to life. Sinne it was that <note place="margin">2. His power.</note> brought Death into the world: and God will shew his strength in this, that Death shall be the utter abolishment, even of that very thing which brought it first upon us, and made us all lyable to it. If there had not beene Sinne, there should not have beene Death: and now God will, that in those that are his, the Kingdome and being of sinne shall utterly be destroyed; the head of <hi>Goliah</hi> shall be cut off with his owne sword, and sinne shall bee extinguished by that which it selfe first procured.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="714" facs="tcp:14764:352"/>
Thirdly, God subjects his children to this course, that by it, <note place="margin">3. Our benefit by Christ.</note> they may the better conceive what inestimable benefit they reape by Jesus Christ. When they doe thinke upon death, as it is an enemie, they cannot chuse but feare it; Nature affecting a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation, and preservation of it selfe, cannot chuse but loath and abhorre it. Now then, if Death being changed be so fearefull; well may wee conclude, that it would have exceeded in terrour, if it had continued as at the first it was; that is, a gate and passage to everlasting torment in hell fire. If the very sight of the Serpent afright us now the sting is out, what would it have done, if the sting had still remained? Hereby then Almighty God would have us learne, how deepely we stand ingaged to him for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, who by his Sonne Jesus Christ hath freed us from so great miserie.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the law of Death seizeth upon the very elect children <note place="margin">4. To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme us to Christ.</note> of God, that they may bee thereby made conformable to their head Christ: Hee was as the wheat-corne, which except it fall into the ground and die, abideth alone, Death was his passage, the same must bee ours also. The way of the tree of life is kept with the blade of a sword shaken, under the stroake whereof, we must first come, before wee can hope for any entrance into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise; as we see here it is sayd of <hi>Rachel,</hi> she dyed.
<q>And Rachel dyed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will not stand upon any division of the words, but will (God willing) unite them together at this time, in this discourse. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is not altogether impertinent in the handling of these words of my Text, to shew you the occasion of <hi>Rachels</hi> death; what shee was, and for what shee stands recorded in the sacred Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rachel</hi> was one of <hi>Labans</hi> Daughters, and one of the Wives of <hi>Iacob.</hi> Questionlesse, shee was a good woman, though in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things faulty: But the imperfections of the holy people of those times, are neither to bee blazed abroad (as though wee tooke pleasure in discovering their shame,) nor to bee followed neither; as though by their doing this or that, were a sufficient plea for us; that were to draw bloud, not milke out of the breasts of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, and is a thing, which for my own perticular were the cause never so just, I doe from my soule abhorre and detest.</p>
                  <p>First of all then, shee is recorded to have beene fruitfull, by <note place="margin">

                     <pb n="715" facs="tcp:14764:352"/>The fruitfulnesse of the wife, is to bee reckoned as a blessing, and to bee ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly sought by prayer from Almighty God.</p>
                  <p>It is that blessing which God promiseth to the man that feares him, and puts his trust in him; <hi>That his Wife should bee as a fruitfull Vine, and his Children they shall stand as Olive branches round about his table, Psal.</hi> 128. 3.

When God would punish <hi>Abimilech,</hi> about <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife; it is sayd, <hi>that hee closed up all the wombes in the house of Abimilech, Gen.</hi> 20. 18. And when God would blesse <hi>Iobs</hi> last dayes more than his first, hee gave him seven sonnes, and three daughters, as an <note place="margin">Gen. 20. 18.</note> addition to his happinesse, and as so many emblems of his grace, and favour towards him. In the rehearsing of the lives of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before the Flood, you shall finde, especially in <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times thus, such, and such a one lived so many yeares, <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi>

What blessing gave the friends of <hi>Rebecka</hi> at her departure? was <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 28.</note> it not this, <hi>bee the mother of thousands, and millions, Gen.</hi> 24. 60. What was the manner of Gods blessing the <hi>Iewes</hi> after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne <note place="margin">Gen 24. 60.</note> from the captivity? was it not this, <hi>that their streets should be full of boyes, and girles? Zech.</hi> 8. 5.</p>
                  <p>This being so, it may serve for a two fold Use;</p>
                  <p>First, it discovers the wretchednesse of their fault, who grudge and repine at the increase of children as a burthen. Some there are that prescribe to God how many children hee should bestow upon them, and would set him downe a stint, that they would not by any meanes have him exceed; which argues a most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and a most faithlesse minde: For whence is this feare of increase before it come? and whence is this repining at it when it is come, but from some distrustfull opinion or other, that they conceive either of their inabilitie to maintaine them &amp;c? Let me say to you, beloved, of your children, as our blessed Saviour sayd of his Disciples touching themselves; <hi>they are of more valew than sparrowes,</hi> yet the Lord feeds them, together with <hi>the young Ravens that crie;</hi> how much more will hee give supply to those creatures that are stamped with his owne Image.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it onely a reward and blessing upon the rich that they are fruitfull, but it is even a reward and blessing to the poore, that they have children: for it is specified in <hi>Psal.</hi> 107. 41. that <hi>God</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 107. 41.</note> 
                     <hi>will make them a family like a flocke of sheepe;</hi> and comfortable it is, that they shall have a family like a flocke of sheepe, because this
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:14764:353"/>
may well be intended; they shall prosper and thrive with a little maintenance, as sheepe will grow fat, albeit the leas are but very short.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it serves to direct all that desire this blessing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, that they may know of whom to seeke it; it is God that must make thee fruitfull like <hi>Rachel;</hi> it is hee that <hi>makes the barren to dwell with the familie, and to hee a joyfull mother of Children.</hi> There are five speciall keyes that God reserves in his owne power.</p>
                  <p>The first, is the key of the Raine; <hi>the Lord shall open his good treasure, and the Heavens to give Raine to the land, Deut.</hi> 28. 12. <note place="margin">Deut. 28. 12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the key of food; <hi>thou openest thy hand, and fillest all things living with thy plenty, Psal.</hi> 104. 28. <note place="margin">Psal. 104. 28.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the key of the graue; <hi>hee bringeth downe to the grave, and raiseth up againe, 1 Sam.</hi> 2. 6. <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 6.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the key of the heart; it is sayd <hi>Acts 16. 14. the Lord opened the heart of Lydia.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 16. 14.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly and lastly, the key of the wombe; God remembred <hi>Rachel and opened her wombe, Gen. 30. Abraham</hi> therefore being <note place="margin">Gen. 30. 22.</note> childlesse, he makes his moane to God. <hi>Isaack</hi> prayed to God for his Wife, because shee was barren. <hi>Hanna, Samuels</hi> mother, pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out her soule to God in hearty prayer, when shee had no child. As also <hi>Zacharie,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Parents of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist. This is the true course, first to God, and then to the meanes. <hi>Rachel</hi> was in a passion, and shee cried to her Husband, <hi>give mee Children or else I die;</hi> but nothing of all this prevailed, till shee sought it of the Lord, and then shee was fruitfull, that is the first.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is recorded of her, that she was not onely fruitfull; but that with this fruitfulnesse of hers, there came an increase of Gods people; shee built up a great part of <hi>Israel:</hi> and what else were the <hi>Isralites,</hi> but Gods peculiar people? A right christian indeed is called a true <hi>Isralite;</hi> and the elect are termed by Saint <hi>Paul Gal. 6. 16. the Israel of God:</hi> So then hence you may inferre, <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 16.</note> that</p>
                  <p>The desire of having Children, must ayme at the increase, and inlargement of Gods Church.</p>
                  <p>This is a blessing indeed, when the wife by her off-spring builds up <hi>Israel;</hi> not <hi>Babel; Bethel,</hi> Gods house; not <hi>Bethaven,</hi> the house of iniquitie. This was the desire of holy people of old, when they prayed that their children might bee as <hi>Corner-stones, couched into the walls of the Temple;</hi> meaning thereby, that they might grow into the Temple of the Lord, to bee a habitation of God by his Spirit: <hi>Blessed is the man</hi> sayth the Psalmist, <hi>that hath his quiver full of them:</hi> it is of such children, that are as the arrowes <hi>of
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:14764:353"/>
a strong man.</hi> Whence it followes, that they must have more in them then nature: for arrowes are not arrowes by growth, but by Art: so they must bee such children, the knottinesse of whose nature, is refined, and reformed, and made smooth by grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ishmael</hi> the sonne of the bond-woman had twelve sonnes, and all Princes in their Nations; but what did all these titles of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie doe them good, as long as they were out of the promise? Questionlesse <hi>Hanna's</hi> drift in desiring a sonne of God, was that out of her might come one, by whom Gods glory might bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced among men, therefore shee vowed him to the Lord all the dayes of his life. The Angell told <hi>Zacharie</hi> that he should have joy and gladnesse at the birth of his sonne, why? <hi>Because he should bee great in the sight of the Lord, and filled with the holy Ghost, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 1 50.</note> 
                     <hi>turne many to the Lord,</hi> Luk. 1. 50. Hee that begets a foole, that is, an ungodly irreligious sonne: for that is one of <hi>Solomons</hi> fooles, he <hi>gets himselfe sorrow, and the father of such a one shall have no joy;</hi> but hee shall be his very calamitie, and his meere vexation. It is a rule set downe in Scripture, that whatsoever is done, should bee done to the glory of God: therefore our desire of having children must aime at this, that out of our loynes may come such, by whom Gods glory may bee promoted, and the number of the godly increased in the world.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, shee is recorded to have yeelded in all willingnesse, <note place="margin">3. Obedient.</note> and readinesse to the desire of her Husband: When <hi>Iacob</hi> was war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by an Angell from God, to returne from <hi>Laban</hi> to the Land where he was borne; he made his wives acquainted with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and discovered to them his whole intent and purpose: they forth-with gave him this yeelding, and respective answer; <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 31. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>God hath said unto thee, that doe,</hi> Gen. 31. 11. The like is to be seene in <hi>Sara,</hi> shee was no hindrance to <hi>Abraham</hi> in his removall from his owne Countrey to <hi>Canaan;</hi> no, nor at such time when she was ignorant whether he went: she was no hindrance to him in the speedie circumcising of his sonne; No, nor shee did not goe about to hinder him, in the very sacrificing of his sonne. Out of all doubt, if shee had beene a clogge to him in any of these respects the Spirit of God would never have concealed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it, because the wrestling with her unwillingnesse, and gain-saying had beene a strong evidence of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, that the Scripture is very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to set out to the full, for his credit and our instruction.</p>
                  <p>There are two Women storied in the Scripture above others as examples of Gods judgements upon the untowardnesse of Wives, not joyning with, and incouraging their Husbands in good doing. The one is <hi>Lots</hi> Wife, whose love no question was a great delay to <hi>Lot</hi> in his departure from <hi>Sodome,</hi> that when shee should have gone on with her Husband in hast to the place which
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:14764:354"/>
was appointed for their refuge without looking backe, shee drew behind still, lingring after her wonted home; but what was the issue? shee was turned into a Pillar of salt. The other was <hi>Michal</hi> the wife of <hi>David,</hi> when shee looked out, and saw <hi>David</hi> dance before the Arke, shee despised him in her heart, and was so farre from approving his zeale, that when hee returned, shee entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him with a frumpe, saying to him, <hi>What a foole was the King of Israel this day:</hi> but what was the issue of it? a punishment was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on her for her fault, that shee had no child all the dayes of her life, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 23. <note place="margin">2 Sam 6. 23.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I remember a policie of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epistle hee wrote to <hi>Philemon:</hi> he writes to him for the re-entertainment of a runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate servant that hee had begotten to God in his bonds, and for the better effecting of it in his inscription, he not only writes to <hi>Philemon,</hi> but joynes with him <hi>Philemons</hi> wife; <hi>To Philemon our</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Philem. 1. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>dearely beloved, and to our beloved Appia,</hi> Philem. 1. 2. Wherefore was this? For nothing else I beleeve, but to warne her of her dutie, that when the receiving of <hi>Onesimus</hi> was manifested to her Husband, as a needfull dutie, and a thing pleasing to Almightie God, she should not put in her spoke to withstand the motion, but further it by all the meanes wee could. It was to this end that the woman was created, that shee might be a helpe to her Hueband in all honest offices, to joyne with him, to incourage him, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him, and assist him in the performance of them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and lastly, to omit many other things recorded of <note place="margin">4. Her death.</note> her, that I might here relate to you, and to come to that that more neerely concernes this present occasion, it is said of <hi>Rachel,</hi> shee died in travell. God had commanded <hi>Iacob</hi> to rise, and goe up to <hi>Bethel,</hi> and dwell there: hee obeyed, and erected a Pillar in the place where God talked with him: thence hee journeyed a little further to <hi>Ephrath,</hi> and there <hi>Rachel</hi> travelled, and had hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: in the sufferance of which, which might be some ease, shee received a great deale of comfort from her Midwife, who bade her not feare, for shee should have this sonne also: but <hi>it came to passe as her soule was departing: for shee died, that her sonnes name was called Benoni,</hi> that is, a sonne of sorrow, as we see verse 18.</p>
                  <p>Who can expresse the woe of that day? and the bitternesse of that losse to <hi>Iacob?</hi> who was now bereft of his dearely-beloved Wife, by the fruit of whose wombe hee had reaped such increase of blessing? before, the children had the care of two watching over them; now only of one, and that such a one as was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to interest himselfe in training up young Children, but left it to her, and shee tooke it from him. O death voide of mercy, and respect of persons! that shee should die, it was some grie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e to him, but that shee died in travell, that did most trouble him, and
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:14764:354"/>
increase his griefe. And well might hee style their sonne <hi>Benoni,</hi> the sonne of sorrow: for it was indeed a sorrow to them all: to her, to him, to their issue, to their friends, and acquaintance, to their servants, to all that knew them, or had any relation to them.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Iacob</hi> will not exceed the bounds of Christianitie, hee was at the last comforted: he referres himselfe, his children, his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and almost insupportable losse to God Almighties pleasure; from him she was received, and to him he is content againe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne all. The mourning, and lamenting that he made on her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe it could not recall her againe: all the teares he could shed for her, were of no force or power at all to make her alive; too much sorrow might happily indanger his owne life, and then he should highly offend against Almightie God. Patience and Christian for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude were the only remedies left him, and these he resolves on.</p>
                  <p>Let us learne hence as long as the world lasts, to know that worldly comforts whatsoever they be, and howsoever wee may esteeme of them, they are subject to change. Love with unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse what may be so loved, but take heed you love not too much, for feare the taking of that away from you, that was so dearely loved of you, make you fall into impatience, and sinne against God.</p>
                  <p>Let us so love that we may thinke of losse, if it stand with Gods pleasure; but yet let us so love, that wee esteeme it no losse if hee please. Let his good will, and pleasure ever-more moderate our affections: so happily we shall enjoy the thing beloved, a great deale longer. But if wee exceed in lamenting, were we as just, and righteous as <hi>Iacob,</hi> God will be angrie with us for it. Not only thy dearest Wife, but thy dearest Child, thy dearest friend; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is most deare to thee, shall then feele the stroake of morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, that the heart may bee taught to wish for eternitie, crying heavily, and sighing with a mournfull voyce, with those words of the Preacher, <hi>Vanitie of vanities, all is but vanitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a threefold punishment inflicted upon all women kind in answer to the three sinnes committed by our Grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, because shee gave too much credit to the words of the Serpent, telling her, that both <hi>Adam</hi> and she shovld bee as Gods, knowing good and evill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore it was pronounced presently upon her, that her sorrowes and conceptions should bee mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because against the expresse command of Almightie God; she did eate the forbidden fruit, therefore it was pronounced against her, that in sorrow she should bring forth Children, every time her houre was at hand shee should hardly escape death. I need
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:14764:355"/>
not inlarge my selfe you all know it to be too true; nay sometimes, and that oft-times too, it costs your lives: an example wee have here in the Text in <hi>Rachel,</hi> and in our deceased Sister here before us, and many others.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and lastly, because she was a seducer of her Husband; therefore for a punishment, all your desires ought to be subject to your Husbands, and by the warrant of the Scripture they must rule over you. Death is a debt to nature and must be paid: there is no avoyding of it, no putting it off, when GOD thinkes it fit, it is infallible to all, in respect of the matter, and end: though in respect of the time and manner many times it be divers. Some die when they are young; some in the middle of their age, and some live till they be very old. That for the time.</p>
                  <p>Some die of Convulsions, some of Dropsies, some of Feavers: and to be short, some in Child-bed; as <hi>Rachel</hi> here did, and our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Sister. But of what disease soever they die, that is nothing: die they must sooner or later, of this infirmitie, or that it is no matter which, when it pleaseth God; Let a man make what shew hee can with all his glorious adornations. Let him have rich ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, and disguised linnen; and searecloth, and balme, and spices, let him be inwrapped in lead, and let stone immure him when hee is dead, yet the earth his originall Mother will againe owne him for her naturall Child, and triumph over him with these, or the like insultings, he is in my bowells, returned to his earth.</p>
                  <p>This bodie returnes not immediatly to heaven, but to the earth; nor to the earth neither as a stranger, and altogether unknowne to him, but to his earth, appropriate to him as his owne, his familiar friend, and old acquaintance. To conclude, wee are sinfull, and therefore wee must die, we are full of evill, and therefore we must goe to the grave: wee have sinnes enough to bring us all thither. God grant they bee not so violent, and full of ominous precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that they portend our sudden ruine? portend it they do, but <hi>O nullam sit in omnia,</hi> &amp;c. I am loath to bee redious. Hee should not be tedious that reades a lecture of mortalitie. How many in the world since this Sermon first began, have made an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and proofe of this truth, of this sentence, that man is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; and those spectacles are but examples of this truth; they come to their period, before my speech. My speech, my selfe, and all that heare me, all that breath in this ayre must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. It hath beene said wee live to die; give me leave a little to invert it, let us liue to live, live the life of grace, that we may live the life of glory, and then though we doe die, let us never feare it, we shall rise from the dead againe, and live with our God out of the reach of the dead, for ever, and ever. So much for the Text at this time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="721" facs="tcp:14764:355"/>
To declare unto you the cause of this present assembly would be altogether superfluous, the dumbe oratorie of that silent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, doth give you to understand in a language sufficiently intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible, that we are now met to performe the last rites and dutie that we owe to the memorie of our deare Sister here before us. And Christian charitie hath beene so powerfull in all ages, that it hath beene retained as a pious, and laudable custome at Funerall solemnities to adorne the dead, with the deserved praises of their life: not for any pompe or vaine-glorious ostentation, but that Gods glorie here may bee for ever magnified, by whose grace they have beene enabled to <hi>fight a good fight:</hi> and that the survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving may be encouraged to runne the same course, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them discharged of this tedious combat, and crowned with a crowne of glory, and immortalitie.</p>
                  <p>This Sister of ours was borne in this parish, and hath lived in it some thirtie foure yeares, or there-about, eighteene yeares a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle woman, and sixteene yeares a married Wife; of whom though upon my owne knowledge I can speake but little, yet having cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible information from others, with whom she had long, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intimacie of many yeares acquaintance, I must, and will speake.</p>
                  <p>That which I told you was recorded of <hi>Rachel,</hi> that shee was fruitfull in procreation of Children, may in a great measure bee spoken of her: for if the Scripture account bearing but of two children fruite: certainly it will make an extraordinarie fruite in bearing of twelve, which shee did. It is a certaine token of a true, and faithfull servant of God, to frequent his house, to pray unto him, to praise him in his Church earnestly; to labour to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in his will out of his Word, then, and there, read and preached to them: all which evidences of a good Christian were found in this our Sister. For her constant comming to Church, I my selfe can now speake upon my owne knowledge, I have seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and strictly examined my selfe, and I professe ingenously before God that knowes my heart, and you that heare me speeke, that I cannot call to mind, that ever she mist comming to Church twice a Sabbath day since I came, which I would be heartily glad I could speake as well of others of this Parish, as of her. For some of them have got such a fisking tricke up and downe, to goe to other Churches, as if there were no rellishable food at their owne, that I feare at the last they will come to none at all, I pray God they amend this fault. It was a vertue in her that deserved commendation, and it is a vice in them that deserves reprehension.</p>
                  <p>When shee was in Gods house, shee did not as too too many doe, imploy her time in sleeping, or some such ill course: but I ever observed her to listen very diligently, and attentively to
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:14764:356"/>
what was delivered, for the nourishing of her soule. I confesse I doe not remember that ever I saw her take any notes in the Church of Sermons that were preached: for it seemes shee did it when she came home: for since her death, going to her house, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally I met with a booke of hers, wherein shee had written many texts of Scripture with notes: the day when they were preached, and the persons by whom, most of those which I have preached I saw and perused, and others of stangers that I my selfe have heard: these qualities are not to be past over in silence, but are worthy of your serious imitation.</p>
                  <p>Neither did she thinke it fit barely to set them downe for her owne instruction only: but what she heard upon the Sabbath day that she constantly practised upon the weeke dayes. Shee cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chised her children in those points; spending, some time in tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them up in the knowledge of God, and putting them in mind of their dutie to him in whom <hi>wee live and move, and have our being,</hi> by repeating Gods word delivered, by hearing them reade Gods word printed, and by singing Psalmes, and hymnes, and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all songs.</p>
                  <p>That she was a most provident, and carefull Wife, and a most indulgent, and loving Mother, all that knew her can best testifie, and some of them have informed me. And this let me speake, and I have it from the mouth of some, that perhaps did not thinke I would have mentioned it at this time, and would have had it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, but for reasons best knowne to my selfe, I hold it very fit to relate: shee was ever held to be of a most sweet nature, and of a very loving disposition; that shee was very charitable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to relieve the poore; It is likewise testified of her, she was liberall alway; but more liberall now then usually, having had a consideration of the hard and needie times: to which end, as if shee had prognosticated her owne death, shee layd by some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney (according to that abilitie that God had blessed her with) for the reliefe of the poore.</p>
                  <p>Let no man censure me for speaking these things I doe: for if I should not have given her, her just, and deserved praises; some that now heare me, and knew her from her cradle, might justly have censured me for too much remisnesse. Thus for her life.</p>
                  <p>As for her death, I can say little touching it. It pleased God, not to giue her any long time of sicknesse, but to take her away; though not unprepared, yet on a sudden with a short warning. When her bitter pangs first came upon her, she called to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and desired him to joyne with her in hearty prayer to Almightie God, that he would bee graciously pleased to extend his mercie towards her; that hee would be pleased to let her live longer, that she might repent of her sinnes, and beg mercie at his
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:14764:356"/>
hands for them, that shee might amend her life. And if he would not grant this for her, yet for those many poore Children that were young, that she was to leave behind her: shee desired him to be a carefull Father over them all: shee prayed to God devoutly to send a blessing both upon him, and them.</p>
                  <p>Much shee could not then speake, because of her paines, that now began still to increase upon her. When shee was in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of her labour, he being absent (as it was fitting) she sent downe to him, to desire him to pray to God on her behalfe, that he would ease her of those grievous paines, and preserve her in the great paine, and perill of Child-birth. The propitious God it seemed heard him, and granted his request: for presently to the thinking of the standers by, shee was well delivered. Not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this, having received so great a blessing from God, shee sent downe againe to desire him, to give God thankes for her safe deliverie. But God, that had determined to take out of this miserable life, quickly turned that hope of the standers by into a feare, and suddenly shee changed: which perceiving, as long as shee was able to speake, shee cried, Lord Jesus have mercy on my soule, Lord have mercie on mee, Lord pitty mee poore miserable wretch: and when she could not speake, shee held up her hands to heaven, as desirous to make her peace with that God, whom shee knew shee had highly offended. I make no question, but God hath translated her from the valley of teares, to the Mount Sion, of blessednesse: whether God of his infinite mercie bring us all.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He intent of this Chapter, is to take off an abuse of the Doctrine of the <note place="margin">Coherence.</note> Gospell, which publisheth the free Grace of God to great sinners. The Apostle had sayd in the latter end of the 20. verse of the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>where sinne abounded, Grace did much more abound.</hi> From hence some did inferre; that therefore under the Gospell they might take liberty to sinne, the more their sinnes were, and the greater they were, the more they should occasion God to manifest his abundant Grace upon them. This the Apostle answers in this Chapter, and he answers it two waies;</p>
                  <p>First, by way of detestation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by way of confutation.</p>
                  <p>By way of detestation in the first verse, and part of the second, <hi>What shall we say then, shall we continue in sinne that Grace may abound? God forbid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="728" facs="tcp:14764:359"/>
Secondly, by way of confutation; the argument whereby hee confutes it, is by a necessarie consequence of our justification; that is, our sanctification: these are so inseperably united together, all that are justified, are sanctified. And upon this ground, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle frames two arguments to confute this errour, taken from the two parts of sanctification.</p>
                  <p>The first is from our mortification, from the third verse, to the end of the seventh; and the argument runnes thus. Those that are dead to sinne, cannot sinne that Grace may abound; but all that are in Christ, are dead to sinne, therefore they cannot sinne that Grace may abound. Now that all that are in Christ are dead to sinne; he proves by their union with Christ, testified in Baptisme, and by the effect of that union, which is conformitie to Christ; that as Christ was dead for sinne, so they are dead to sinne.</p>
                  <p>The second argument, is taken from the second part of our sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which is our quickning to a new life; and that he handles in the 8. 9. 10. verses, and that argument runnes thus. Those that are quickned by Christ to newnesse of life, cannot sin that Grace may abound: but all that are in Christ, are quickned by Christ to newnesse of life; therefore they cannot sinne that Grace may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound. That all that are in Christ are quickned to newnesse of life; he proves in verse 8. <hi>If we be dead with Christ, we beleeve that we shall live with him still</hi> by our union with Christ, whereby there comes a conformity to Christ in his resurrection, as well as in his death.</p>
                  <p>And from these premises, hee inferres by way of application, the conclusion that is here in the words of the Text I have now read to you; <hi>likewise reckon ye also your selves dead unto sinne, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live to God, through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi> As if he should say, doe not rest your selves satisfied in the bare knowledge of these things, in the discourse of them in generall, but bring them to particular application, make the case your owne; what wee say of death to sinne, and of newnesse of life wee speake to you, if ye be in Christ; therefore you must make account of it to bee your case, <hi>likewise reckon ye your selves dead to sinne, but alive to God through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi> We see now the coherence of the words with those that goe before, and the maine intent and scope of the Apostle in the Chapter wherein we might note divers things.</p>
                  <p>The first is out of the very connexion, that <hi>by vertue of the union of beleevers with Christ, there is in them a conformitie to Christ.</hi> They <note place="margin">Observ. 1.</note> are made like unto him; he had sayd before, that Christ dyed, and rose againe; likewise reckon ye your selves like him in this. Every one that is in Christ, is conformable to Christ, and made like him.</p>
                  <p>Then againe secondly, wee might note hence this also, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="729" facs="tcp:14764:359"/>Rectified and sanctified reason, ever concludes to God, and for God.</p>
                  <p>Reckon yee, make account, conclude this, so the word signifieth, reason thus, conclude thus; as it is used <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>Wee</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>conclude</hi> (saith the Apostle, where the same word is used) <hi>That a man is justified by Faith without the workes of the Law.</hi> So, conclude this, rest on this conclusion, do not make it a matter of conjecture, and opinion onely: but when you consider things wisely, when you weigh things seriously, you shall see great reason to inferre those things, from these premisses that God would have you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre. Therefore whatsoever reasoning is against the Word, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever disputes the mindes of men uphold against any truth in Scripture, it is but the reasoning of corrupt reason; If reason were sanctified, it would conclude as 2 <hi>Cor. 5. We judge, if one dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>for all, then they that live, should not live to themselves, but to him that dyed for them.</hi> When men come to deale judiciously, and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly, when they come to conclude of things wisely; they will conclude then, that what use the Word and the Gospell would have them make of any truth, that they will make of it, <hi>Likewise reckon ye,</hi> judge thus.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we might note hence thus much also, that</p>
                  <p>The best and most profitable knowledge of the Scriptures, is in applying it <note place="margin">Observ. 3.</note> to a mans owne case, and person, and condition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reckon ye also your selves,</hi> saith the Apostle; make account of thus much, that this is a truth concernes you in particular. Judge your selves so farre profited by the Word you heare, as you can make good application of it to your owne estate and condition. Whensoever men come to heare the Word, they come to heare somewhat that concernes themselves: therefore whatsoever wee say befalls them that are in Christ; apply it your selves, and make account this is my case, if I bee in Christ.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, hence we might note thus much also, that</p>
                  <p>When a man is in Christ, there is a reall change. <note place="margin">Observ. 4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is an evident change from what hee was, before hee was in Christ. For so the Apostle reasons; now you are in Christ, there is such a change, as from death to life, there is a mervellous great change in you. If there bee not this change in you, neither are you in Christ; and all the hopes you build on of being in Christ, they are without a foundation, they are upon an imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Christ, not upon Christ that is yours indeed. If you bee in Christ, let it appeare in a change; let us see how you are changed since you were in Christ, from that you were before: for this make account of, conclude thus much for your selves; that all that are in Christ are changed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="730" facs="tcp:14764:360"/>
But fiftly, and lastly, hee expresseth wherein this change con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth; and hee makes choice of such termes as are most acquisite, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. There is a change in all that are in Christ as from death to life.</note> and fit for his purpose. He would expresse this spirituall change, and marke what expressions hee useth to manifest it by; no lesse then life, and death. There is such a change when you are once in Christ, from what you were before; as there is between a man that was dead, and is now alive; or a man that was alive, and is now dead; and this is that, that I will insist now upon, wherein note these particulars.</p>
                  <p>First, the Analogie and proportion, the aptnesse, and fitnesse of the termes, wherein the Apostle expresseth the spirituall change of those that are in Christ; how fitly they may be sayd to be dead, and alive.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is observeable in what order the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth these first dead, and then alive. Make account that the worke of Grace in the effectuall change in your hearts, it proceeds in this order. First you are dead, and then alive; dead to sin first, and then alive to God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, note the certaine connexion of these two together; so there is not onely a certainty in the object, but a certainty in the subject too; not only a certaintie that those that are in Christ shall live: but it is certaine to you, make account of this, make this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion for your selves, build on it, know it for your selves, as he sayd to <hi>Iob;</hi> it is certaine if you be in Christ, you are dead with Christ, and you shall live with Christ, make account of this.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the efficient cause of this great change exprest in these termes, it is <hi>Iesus Christ our Lord:</hi> make account of this, if you be in Christ, there comes a vertue from Christ, an effectuall work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ by his spirit in your hearts; such a powerfull worke as will conforme you to Christ dead, and to Christ risen; that you shall be dead to sinne, and alive to God: not by any strength in your selves, or any excellent endowment in your owne natures, not by any naturall inclination and abilitie, but through the vertue and power of <hi>Iesus Christ our Lord</hi> working in you. Thus you have the Text opened.</p>
                  <p>Wee will speake first of the Analogie and proportion, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement betweene the metaphors here used, and the things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest <note place="margin">1. The analogy betweeene spirituall, and naturall life and death.</note> by them. That which the Apostle would expresse, is, that there is a marvellous spirituall reall change, in all those that are in Christ, from what they were before. Now let us see how fitly it is exprest in these words, that he sayth <hi>you are dead to sinne, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live to God;</hi> that hee choseth to expresse it by life and death. Had it not beene fit to have sayd thus much; you are changed in your dispositions, in your inclinations, in your intentions, in your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; you are changed in your conversations, you are other kind
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:14764:360"/>
of men in the inclination of your hearts; you bring forth other fruit, you lead other lives then you were wont to doe? But hee expresseth it here yet more fully; that is, by that that includes all these; and if there be any thing more may be added, it includes that too, yee are dead and alive. Then we will consider,</p>
                  <p>First, generally, how death, and life, expresse the state of them that are in Christ.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, consider them in their particular application; how death expresseth the first part of a mans change in sanctification, and life the second part.</p>
                  <p>First, wee take them in generall, and let this bee the point, that</p>
                  <p>A man that is indeed effectually changed by vertue of his union with Christ; hee hath such a change wrought in him, as in a dead, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving man; as in life, or in death.</p>
                  <p>Now, first take it in generall; you know life, and death, they imply, first a generall change; when a man is alive, or when a <note place="margin">1. In Generall.</note> man is dead, there is not a change in some part onely, but in the <note place="margin">1. A Generall, change.</note> whole: So it is here, when a man is effectually changed from what he was, by vertue of his union with Christ.</p>
                  <p>A member may bee dead, and yet neverthelesse the man alive; but if the man be dead, there is a general change that goes through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, it possesseth every part, every member; so that now there is no member of him, but death rules in it, then hee is a dead man. So it is in this, when a man is dead spiritually, there is not a change in some particular actions onely, in some particular opinions one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; there is not an alteration of some of his old customes onely; but it is a generall change, so it goes through the whole man. It is a change in the understanding, he judgeth things otherwise then hee was wont to doe. And there is a change in the will; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of it is to other objects then he was wont to bee inclined to. And thence there is a change in his intentions; he propounds other ends to himselfe then he was wont. So there is a change in respect of the whole; the Word is the rule of all a mans actions. There is a change from particular evills, from one as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that when any thing is discovered to him to bee a sinne, to bee a transgression of the rule; hee is turned from it. So likewise, when any thing is discovered to him to be a dutie, agreeable to the rule according to the will of God revealed in his Word; hee is a vessell of honour prepared for it: and that is it the Apostle espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially means, when he compares them to vessells, and he describes them thus; they are vessells of honour fit for the service of their Master, prepared for every good worke: So that now as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle sayth, <hi>there remaineth no more conscience of sinne.</hi> That is, there
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:14764:361"/>
remains not now any sinne to cleave to the conscience to defile it, to cleave to the conscience so, as a ruling enemie would doe, that would take away all true and perfect peace; all boldnesse, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse to the throne of Grace, there is no such conscience of sinne. This making conscience of every sinne, is that that frees conscience from being defiled in that sence with any sinne. So much for the first.</p>
                  <p>Well, secondly it is expressed by death, and life, to shew the orderlinesse in the proceeding of this change. When a man is <note place="margin">2 The orderly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it.</note> changed by the effecacie and working of Christ to whom hee is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited; it proceeds in such a manner, as the change in death or life. You know death, or life, begin within first; it begins in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, in the heart first. And as in naturall death, or naturall life; there is a dying first of the root, and a quickning first at the root: So likewise in spirituall death, or life; it is an orderly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, it begins first within. Our Saviour Christ gives this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; <hi>First make the inside cleane,</hi> and then all will bee cleane; against the hypocrisie of the Scribes, and Pharisees, that looked more to outward actions. So this change, it is not onely a meere civilizing of a man, a conforming of him to that societie hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseth with in outward actions; but renewing of a man in the <hi>spirit of his minde,</hi> Rom. 12. 2. So the change begins from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that first hee is good, and then hee doth good, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the speech of Christ, <hi>make the tree good, and then the fruit will bee good,</hi> we will not stand upon it: you see the Analogie, and agreement holds betweene these two in generall.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to take them apart more specially: First, how <note place="margin">2. The Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in particular.</note> this being dead to sinne, agrees with that change that is in a man that is in Christ from sinne; <hi>Reckon this,</hi> sayth the Apostle, make account of this, that you are dead to sinne: that is, now there is such a change and turning from your evill courses, from whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is that is truly and properly called sinne in Scripture, you are changed from it. Now in whatsoever sence a man may be said to bee dead, in that sence a man in Christ is changed from sinne, there is somewhat in his change expressing that death. Now there is a threefold death,</p>
                  <p> A <list>
                        <item>Civill</item>
                        <item>Judiciall</item>
                        <item>Naturall</item>
                     </list> Death. <note place="margin">Death, three fold.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>We begin with the judiciall first, as Gods great Worke begins <note place="margin">1 Iudiciall.</note> in the judgement. There is a judiciall death: so one that is alive now in respect of naturall life, may yet bee sayd to bee judicially dead, when hee is dead in sentence; when by the Judge he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:14764:361"/>
to death, when hee is adjudged to die. <hi>So reckon yee your selves dead to sinne;</hi> make account of this, that now in your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is a sentence passed out against sinne, that it shall bee slaine, that it shall bee mortified; thus your judgement stands, and thus you lookeupon it, as a thing dead in sentence; and that is the first. It is that in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 31. saith the Lord, <hi>When I shall bee paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to thee,</hi> this shall follow upon it; <hi>thou shalt judge thy selfe worthy</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>to bee destroyed, for all thine iniquities and abhominations.</hi> When God is reconciled to a man, which is as much as to say, when a man is in Christ: for by Christ we are reconciled to God, this followes upon it, that man comes now to judge sinne to bee a deadly thing, to judge sinne to bee dead, and to judge himselfe worthy to bee destroyed for it. Hee lookes on sinne as it should be looked upon, his opinion is right concerning it: hee accounts it an iniquitie, a thing against that rectitude, against that equitie, and righteousnes wherewith man was once indowed in the Creation; and from which so farre as hee swerves, so farre hee is plunged into death. As you know that curse was denounced against man when he sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he should die: so hee cannot looke upon iniquitie, upon that that is contrary to that righteousnesse wherein hee was made, but hee lookes upon it, as on death it selfe, and a deadly thing; hee lookes upon it as upon an abhomination. That looke as persons that sinned capitally were an abhomination to the Land, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple among whom they sinned; as the Scripture speakes of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, and the like; the land was defiled if the sentence of death were not executed; so it is here in the opinion and judgement of a man that is in Christ, he accounts this the greatest defilement, that his soule remaines so farre polluted and defiled, as there is any life left in sinne. That is the first thing, reckon this then that sinne is dead imediatly; that is, that you now come to passe (as Judges do) a sentence of death against sin: and that howsoever a Malefactour bee not naturally dead, when he is judicially dead; yet hee is in an order to it, the next thing that followes will bee to be cut off. So it is with sinne, when a man comes to judge himselfe for his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, worthy to be destroyed for his abhominations, this is the next thing that followes, hee will not rest, till that bee slaine and subdued, till that Mallefactour bee condemned to death, and cut off and tooke out of the way. Here is the first thing, herein this change is like death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a civill death too; so one that lives natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, may bee dead civilly; so one that is under the subjection and <note place="margin">2. Civill</note> power of another, such a one is dead civilly. The civill Law ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts any one that is under subjection to bee <hi>Civiliter mortuus</hi> as they speake; that is, he is in that sence not accounted among li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving men, hee is one dead, because hee is not annimated, and acted
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:14764:362"/>
by his owne will, but by the will of him that rules him: <hi>so reckon yee your selves dead,</hi> saith the Apostle. Make account that when you are in Christ, sinne is no more to be ruler, and commander, to act, and animate, and quicken you to obey its lusts, that you should beacted, and animated by it, that as soone as sinne tempts, you should obey presently: make account in this sence you are dead to sinne, that is, sinne is dead in you civilly, it hath not a ruling pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; it comes not now as one that hath power to sway all before it: that is it the Apostle saith in this Chapter, <hi>sinne shall not have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion;</hi> You have a new Master, a new Lord, you are no more under the rule and dominion of sinne, that is the second.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is a naturall death, as well as a judiciall, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill <note place="margin">3. Naturall.</note> death, so things are said to be dead naturally, two wayes,</p>
                  <p>
                     <table>
                        <row>
                           <cell>Imperfectly,</cell>
                           <cell>Inchoate.</cell>
                        </row>

                        </row>
                     </table>
                  </p>
                  <p>Naturall death imperfect, and but begun is this, as when there <note place="margin">1. Imperfect.</note> is a great blow given, with an axe to the roote of a tree, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certainly it will wither, and die, and bee made altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull for the time to come: though for the present it have leaves upon it, and though for the present all the fruit that is on it be not quite shooke off, yet now the tree is said to be dead, because there is a blow given at the roote, whereupon it will wither and certainly die. So a man is said to be dead, when hee hath a deadly wound given him, though hee be not now dead; though hee may stirre, and live after, and perhaps doe some hurt to him that woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him; yet hee is dead, because hee is irrecoverably wounded, every one that lookes on him will say hee is dead. So as soone as a man is in Christ, by vertue of his union with Christ, there is such a blow given to the roote of sinne; not in the judgement on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in the affections also; so as it never recovers its strength againe, to bring forth fruite in that abundance as before; and it alway withers, and decayes more and more, till it be quite removed.</p>
                  <p>Now, as it is in this case with a tree; will you know when it is dead? take it in the Spring. All the trees in Winter seeme to bee <note place="margin">Simile.</note> dead: but come in the Spring, and in Summer, and then if a man see there are no leaves, if hee see no fruite upon the tree, now hee concludes it is dead indeed: because it brings not forth fruit in the season of fruit. So, take a man, when there is an occasion, an opportunitie, to turne to folly; when upon deliberation and judgement, he may consider of that opportunitie to mannage it for the service of sinne, it will appeare now if hee be dead, hee will not in such an occasion yeeld, but at such a time especially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist sinne, at such a time hee will not bring forth the fruit of sinne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="735" facs="tcp:14764:362"/>
Looke what the Spring is to the tree, that is occasion to the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of mans heart. Indeed when sinne takes a man upon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, upon unequall termes that he deliberates not, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders not what hee is doing: as <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>I said in my hast;</hi> then many times sinne prevailes, and bindes him, as a theefe doth the master of the house hand and foot: yet neverthelesse when he well weighes, and considers things, at such a time it will appeare that sinne is dead. Thus you see how fitly the termes hold to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the change of a Christian, his judgement is right, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes sinne as death, in the purpose and covenant of his heart whereby hee is bound to God, he disposeth it from its dominion and rule, that what it doth now is as a theefe by stealth, that sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizeth a man in his sleepe; And it hath its deadly wound, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it withers, and decayes, and at last in the sight of all men, and at such a time, when if there were any life it would appeare, at such a time it shall appeare that sinne is dead. Thus you see the first expression opened, the change from sinne by death; <hi>you are dead to sinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now take the second expression, <hi>you are alive to God,</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth <note place="margin">Newnesse of life expressed by life in three respects.</note> the second part of sanctification, that is, the quickning of a man to newnesse of life. It is with thee now, as with one that was dead, and is alive, there is such a change in thee. And how is this expressed by life? Thus; in three respects this change is fitly expressed by life.</p>
                  <p>The first is this, you know life it consists in the union of a man, <note place="margin">1. The principle of life.</note> with the principle of life? when there is a union betweene the body, and the soule here is life. Now though there are bodyes, and spirits, yet the bodyes live not by those spirits, except they be united with them: therefore when the soule is separated from the body, the body dyes, and the man is said no more to be alive: so here in this sence, when there is a union betweene the soule of a man, and the principle of spirituall life, then there is that change wrought, whence hee is said to bee alive. Now the principle of spirituall life is only Christ: so you see here in the Text, <hi>you are alive to God through our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> when there is a union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Christ and you. And how is that? It is by an influence from Christ into the soule, and that is the mightie worke of the Spirit of God, as you see <hi>Ioh. 6. 63. It is the Spirit that quickneth,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 63.</note> saith our Saviour. The great worke that is wrought by the Spirit in quickning a man, is the worke of Faith. <hi>Now I live,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>by faith in the Sonne of God, that died for mee,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. Now when there is such a union betweene Christ and a man, then <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> he lives; there is such a change in him, as there is in life. Therefore beloved, this change is not in any that professe the knowledge of Christ, and have not yet union with Christ. It is not enough that
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:14764:363"/>
a man be called a Christian: it is not enough that a man professe that hee hopes to be saved by Christ; It is not enough that a man goe on in some externall actions as other Christians doe, unlesse that he doth, and that he is in any spirituall action, it be by vertue of his union with Christ, that it be by life received from him by a quickning vertue flowing from him to every member, that is exprest, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 9. by the <hi>branches in the Vine,</hi> they are quickned by <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 1.</note> union in the Vine, cut the branches from the Vine, and they die, and wither. So it is with men, let them be in the Lords Vineyard, yet if they be not united with this Vine Christ, they are but dead men, <hi>dead in trespasses and sinnes,</hi> Ephes. 2. 1. that is the first. <note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, this change is exprest by life in another respect: for looke as in life there is not only an union with the principle of <note place="margin">2. The actions of life.</note> life, but besides that, there are those living actions, and operations that naturally flow from that union in every living creature: so in spirituall life, there are spirituall actions, and operations that flow from every man that is thus united to Christ.</p>
                  <p>As every thing is in being, so it is in working: take a naturall man, he doth naturall actions, by vertue of a naturall life. Take a worldly man, he doth live, (as a man may say) in worldly acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by vertue of that worldly principle that is in him. So take a spirituall man; what is the reason hee delights in spirituall things? <hi>His delight is in the law of the Lord,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>and in that Law hee meditates day and night.</hi> What is the reason his delight is in the Saints; and the more spirituall any one is, the more he delights in them? the reason is this, because he lives a spirituall life, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth actions agreeable to that principle with which hee is united; therefore by this you shall know it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there are certaine properties in life that hold in this <note place="margin">3. The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of life, Appetit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> too, and we will instance but in two.</p>
                  <p>First, wheresoever there is life, there is a naturall appetite, and desire after all meanes that may preserve that life. Wheresoever God gives life to any creature, he gives also a desire to that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to preserve that life it hath, which is the best state of being. Now, it is so with a Christian, all his desires are to preserve spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life, and to increase it: he rests not in what hee hath, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to be more yet, and to doe more yet, to know God more, to love God more, to serve God better; to live more fruitfully, more profitably among men. Hee delights in the actions of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life: therefore hee would strengthen those habites by all actions, and industrie, and indevour. <hi>As new-borne babes,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>desire the sincere milke of the Word, that yee may grow thereby.</hi> No sooner is there life in a new-borne babe, but there is a desire to nourish that life. You see there is a naturall appetite even in the very trees, that thrust their rootes downe into the ground, to
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:14764:363"/>
draw moysture below from the earth, by an instinct to preserve that life they have in the stocke, and in the branches. So it is in every man that hath a spirituall life, he puts forth with all indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie for all spirituall helpes, according to that strength hee hath for the preservation of his spirituall life. That is the reason why they are not content, in the abundance of all outward things, when they want spirituall helpes: and that is the reason that they are not satisfied, nor solace themselves in dead, worldly, company; that is the reason their hearts rest not in things below; because these are not the food of their spirituall life; these are not the things that preserve that life that is in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as there is a desire of the preservation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of life, so there is a desire of propagation, and transfusion of it to others, <note place="margin">2 Propagation.</note> as much as may be. So you see those things that have but a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphoricall life (as we may say) that are said to live by way of allusion, and metaphor, as the fire in the coale, when it is said to liue in the coale, it is for this reason, because it is apt to kindle ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is so in a Christian, wheresoever there is spirituall life, there is a desire to communicate it with as many as it can. And this you see in all the servants of God, <hi>Philip calls Nathaniel, Ioh.</hi> 1. 44. when he had gained the knowledge of Christ. And the <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 44.</note> woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> goes to call in the Citie when shee had gained the knowledge of Christ. When a man himselfe is united with the principle of life, when he lives in Christ, he desires that others may live in Christ too; and this desire, and indeavour to gaine many to Christ, it appeares in their place, and relation. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian master that lives a spirituall life, will labour that his servants under him may live the life of grace with him too. A Christian Father will labour that his children may live to God, as well as himselfe: a Husband will labour to draw his Wife to Christ as himselfe is drawne; and every one, father and friend, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as much as in them lies, by any advantage and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that is put into their hands, they will draw others to Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is life in them.</p>
                  <p>And this is not done out of faction, out of a desire to make their partie strong, as many in the world desire to strengthen their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: but as in living things there is a naturall desire to convey that life to others. Parents beget not children out of faction to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the partie, but out of a naturall affection to convey the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life they have to others: so Christians, that they doe is out of spirituall affection, out of simple love to the salvation of others: out of a naturalnesse in their disposition, to indevour that all may belike them. As the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wisheth, that all that heard him were like him except those bonds. So much for that: you see how fitly the Apostle useth these termes of life, and death to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:14764:364"/>
the change of one that is in Christ, when he turnes from sin to God.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to see the order wherein the Apostle expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them, <hi>make account of this,</hi> conclude of this, that you were <note place="margin">The order.</note> dead, but are alive. First, you were dead to sinne, and then alive to God. These certainly are knit together, but they are done in order: so wee joyne both those points in one, and that is thus much, that</p>
                  <p>All that are in Christ, hee workes in them by his spirit in this order, they <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Observ.</hi> Men first die tosin, and then live to God.</note> first die to sinne, and after live to God.</p>
                  <p>These two are inseparable, but yet they are joyned in order, that first men die to sinne, and secondly live to God. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expresseth this in fit similitudes. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 22. 24. saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle there, <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 22. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Seeing you have put off the old man, that is corrupt through deceivable lusts, and put on the new man, that after God is created in righteousnesse, and true holinesse:</hi> Here is the order, there is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an effectuall change, but this is wrought in a method, first put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off and then putting on. Hee seemes to allude to apparell there, that as a man that is cloathed with ragges, hee puts not on ornaments, and robes, till he have put off his ragges, as it is <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. <note place="margin">Zach. 3.</note> when <hi>Iehoshua</hi> came before the Angell of the Lord with fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie garments, with vile rayment, saith the Lord, take away those ragges, and put upon him change of rayment. Just thus God deales in the conversion of a man, in the change of a man that is in Christ, he takes away his filthy ragges first, his love to sinne, he is no more cloathed with them as he was wont; he accounts them not ornaments as they were wont to doe, but filthy clouts, to which he saith, <hi>Get yee hence;</hi> he detests them, and then hee is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with rayment, then he expresseth the fruit of holinesse and righteousnesse. Another expression there is, <hi>Ephes. 5. 8. Yee were</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>darknesse, but now yee are light in the Lord, walke as children of light.</hi> There is not only a change of apparell; that is, from ragges to robes, but of your state and condition: you were in darknesse, now yee are light. Marke the order, from darknesse to light. That looke as it was in the Creation, first darknesse covered the face of the deepe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. all was without forme, and voyd, and <note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> then God said, <hi>Let there bee light:</hi> so now, first there is a removing of the darknesse the soule was held in, and now yee are light in the Lord: so they come to walke as children of light. Well, this is is the expression of it in Scripture: let us see the ground of it in reason. It must bee so that in this order God proceedes in this effectuall change: first to turne men from sinne, and then to GOD; first to die to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>inne, and then to live to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="739" facs="tcp:14764:364"/>
The first reason shall bee taken from our union with Christ; <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 4. 5. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>We are planted into Christ,</hi> sayth the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. 5. 6. By being planted with Christ, there growes a similitude betweene <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reason.</hi> 1. From our u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Christ.</note> Christ and us. <hi>Wee are baptized, and buried by baptisme,</hi> sayth the Apostle <hi>into his death; and wee are raised and quickned,</hi> sayth hee, <hi>by the resurrection of Christ:</hi> that like as it was with Christ, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>o it is with us; Hee was dead, and raysed, so wee are first dead to sinne, and then alive to God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it must be so from the nature of contraries, for these two things are contrarie one to another: there is an immediate <note place="margin">2. From the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie of them.</note> opposition betweene them; so as there must bee a removing of the one, if there bee a possession of the other; and there must bee first a removing of the one, before the other can be in the soule. As you see in sicknesse, and in health; there must first bee a removing of sicknesse, before the bodie bee in a right state of health. And as in life, and death this is the order; they are brought first from death to life, and then one necessarily followes the other: as life necessarily followes upon the removall of death, and health, upon the removall of sicknesse.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it must bee so; or else if both these were not, and in this order wrought: what difficultie were there in the life of a Christian? what singular thing were there in a Christian, above any man in the world? Every man in the World doth outward actions; if there were not such a change as from death to life, there were no difference at all, where were the difficultie? The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sayth, <hi>The way is narrow and straight that leades to life, and few there bee that finde it:</hi> what narrownesse or straightnesse were there in the way to life? if there were no more but thus, that a man might settle upon some actions of Religion, and so bee effectually changed? If this were all, what great matter were there in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? what need <hi>Agrippa</hi> stand out in the mid-way? what need hee be but halfe perswaded to bee a Christian? hee might easily be perswaded to be a Christian, if he might hold his Heathenisme, and be a Christian too. What need <hi>Faelix</hi> tremble, to heare <hi>Paul</hi> dispute of righteousnesse and judgement to come, if hee might be unrighteous, and a Christian too? What need the young man be sorrie, when Christ bade him sell all and follow him; if he might hold all hee had, and be worldly affected, and be a Christian too? what need any of the labours of a Christian? to what use were a power of godlines, spoken of in Scripture? What powerfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were there in Religion, if a man might hold his sinnes, and yet bee a Christian, and a beleever, and be in Christ too? a drunkard, and yet bee saved? a prophaner of the Sabbath, and yet bee in Christ? what great matter were there? it were nothing to bee a Christian; nay who would not bee one? What need Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="740" facs="tcp:14764:365"/>
expose himselfe to such watchings, and fastings, and sufferings, if hee might have gone on in the way of the World, and yet bee in Christ too? No beleved, it is another-gates matter to bee a Christian, then for a man to hold his old customes, and waies, and courses, and yet hope to bee saved too. Let no man deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>th this, the matter of Christianitie, it is a laborious worke, Religion is a very serious thing. A man that indeed will bee Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, hee must follow Christs rule; first deny himselfe, and take up his Crosse and follow him: what need a man deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, if hee might hold his sinnes, and yet follow Christ? Well know this, the ground is cleare, there must bee a turning from sin, as well as a turning to God, if a man have union with Christ.</p>
                  <p>Now to conclude, with a word of application; First, if it bee so, It serves to convince us this day in the presence of God, the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Conviction.</note> multitude of us now before the Lord to heare the Word, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse our union with Christ, and yet there is no such matter. If wee were united with Christ, there would bee living to God, by vertue of that union with Christ. It is living to God in the course of our life, that gives us comfort of our union with Christ. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not your selves, wee may say of many, as the Lord sayth of <hi>Sardis, Thou hast a name to live, but art dead.</hi> There are abundance that have a name to live, but are dead: A man would wonder at it, that wee should say to a Congregation of so many people; that there were few alive among them all: that the most whose eyes are now upon the Minister, and whose eares are open to the Word; yet they are but dead, they are not alive, though they walke, and though they speake and doe the actions of a naturall life; they live naturally, but are dead spiritually, they have a name to live, but are dead.</p>
                  <p>The Lord tells <hi>Ieremie, Ierem.</hi> 5. That there was such want of <note place="margin">Ier. 5.</note> good men in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that hee might goe up and downe the Streets of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and not finde a man. A man would wonder that the Lord should use such an expression; Hee might have said, hee should not finde a good man, a just man, a godly man; but not finde a man sayth hee, as if hee were not worthie the name of a man in the Streets of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that was not appliable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Gods will. That a man should goe in the Streets of <hi>London,</hi> and not finde a man; that hee should goe into <hi>Moore-fields</hi> on the Sabbath day, and see a multitude of dead Ghosts walking there; that hee should goe in the Streets, and see a multitude of dead persons sitting at their doores: that hee should goe up and down to the houses of men, and see a multitude of dead creatures talke of worldly things on the Lords day: a man would wonder hee should finde so many dead men, eating, and drinking, and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and walking, and yet dead still. The Text makes it cleare
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:14764:365"/>
here, If wee bee not dead unto sinne, wee are not alive to God; there is no being alive to God, except a man be first dead to sin.</p>
                  <p>Shall wee come to the tryall? Beloved, there wee shall finde among the many of you that heare the Word, many are dead in sinne. What meanes the prophanation of the Sabbath? what meanes the great neglect of Familie-duties? Come to your hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, there bee not the prayers of living men there; there bee not the meditations, and conferences of men that are spiritually alive in your Families; and shall wee thinke you are alive? Come to men in their shops, and dealings, and see them dead in their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and covetousnesse; and shall we say they are alive to God? Alas beloved, goe to the particulars of mens lives, you shall heare them speak the words of dead men, spiritually dead; in swearing, and cursing, and reviling, and blaspheming, and bitternesse; and yet shall wee say that they are alive? Looke upon all the actions of men, it were an endlesse worke; where wee finde dead workes, wee conclude there is a dead man: when men doe the things that are the actions of a man spiritually dead, we conclude they are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually dead; the Holy Ghost sayth so, <hi>for they are dead in trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and sinnes;</hi> therefore now let us come a little closer. There are abundance that perswade themselves that they are alive; therefore a little try your life, by your death to sinne.</p>
                  <p>What are your opinions, and judgements, concerning your owne wayes? those things that the Word of God condemnes for evill: those things that out of the Word are preached to you day lie by way of reproofe of sinne; that are spoken to you by Christian friends, by way of admonition to bring you out of your sinnes, how doe you take them, and digest them? are they pleasing to you, because they tend to the killing of sinne? or are they distastefull, because they give you not rest in your sinnes? What; doe you judge sinne worthy to live, and your selves not dead the while? It is a note of a man that is alive in sin, that hates reproofe; that hates him <hi>that reproveth in the gate:</hi> hee that hates him that reproves his ill workes, hee is not dead to sinne, for hee doth not judge his sinne worthy to die.</p>
                  <p>Againe, come to your affections, what is it you delight in? When a man lookes upon a thing that is dead, if it be indeed dead; the sight of it is terrible, and gastly, and troublesome to him. When <hi>Sara</hi> was dead, though <hi>Abraham</hi> loved her deare in her life, <hi>remove my dead out of my sight?</hi> If sinne in thee bee as a dead thing, how doest thou looke upon it? dost thou looke upon it as a thing that thou art afraid of? as a thing that thou art the worse when thou seest it. When the objects and occasions of sinne are presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you, how stand you affected then? all that are dead in sin, take thought to fulfill the lusts of the flesh, as the Apostle sayth,
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:14764:366"/>
they delight in it, sinne is sweet to them as <hi>Iob</hi> sayth: but if on the otherside you looke on it with indignation, loathing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing, and abhorring sinne, and your selves for sinne; then it is a comfortable signe of your death to sinne.</p>
                  <p>Againe, when you doe looke on it, doe you looke upon it as a ruler, or as an enemie? for there is a great deale of difference. A theife may come into the house, as well as the Master of the house; but they come not with the like authoritie, nor with the like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance: the theife comes, but you know all the house sets against him, and never rest till they cast him out; and if they want strength, they cry for helpe: but the Master of the house comes in, and then all the servants are in their places to doe him service, all take care to please him, and give him content. How entertaine you the motions of sinne? looke upon your former wayes, upon your former customes, and vanities; looke upon your wonted course of ill, and consider now whether there bee an endeavour to satisfie the sinfull inclination of your hearts? or is there a striving, and using all meanes to be rid of it? Do you make this your question to the Ministers you converse with, to the Christian friends with whom you consult in this case, how to be rid of such a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, how to get such a sinne purged out? Is this the matter of your prayer to God? doe you crie to Heaven for helpe, to get out this theife that is stollen into your hearts, this traytour that conspires against the glorie of God, this rebell, that maintaines a fight against the kingdome of Christ, doe you so looke on it? It is a signe you are dead to sinne, or else sinne is alive in you, and you are dead in sinne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and lastly, consider your actions, consider your conversation; doth sinne get strength, or is it weakened? For know that this is not the mortification of sinne, that a man be never troubled with it more, that hee never heare more of it, that hee be never more troubled with the motions of sinne, no? As a man that hath a deadly wound given him, it may bee hee more fiercely sets on him that gave him the deadly blow, then ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yet he falls dead at his feet after, so it is with the motions of sinne: thinke not when sin is dead, by vertue of our union with Christ, that we shall not bee tempted any more to sinne, that you shall not have sinne any more in you: no, it will bee in you, and molest you; But what fruit doe you bring forth? What actions doe you? what strength hath sinne? all the strife it hath, is but to disquiet, and disturbe you, not to rule and command you as it was wont to doe. It is a signe that sinne is dead naturally, by way of incoation, it will die in the end, you shall heare no more of it at the last: and though it a great while disturbe you, and disquiet you; yet this is your comfort you are disturbed, and you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:14764:366"/>
Gods quarrell against your corruptions, and fight against it; it is a signe it hath a deadly blow. Therefore let every one consider his estate, let no man denie himselfe his owne portion: let him that is dead in sinne, know that hee is dead, and the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednesse of that condition, eternall death begins in that death. And let him that is dead to sinne, know that hee is alive to God, and is among those that live in Christ, and shall be saved.</p>
                  <p>A word of exhortation, and so I conclude. Doth this testifie our life in Christ, that wee are dead to sinne? Then as you hope <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Exhortation.</note> for any comfort, or privilege, or advantage by Christ; labour to make this good to your soules, and labour to secure this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence more and more, that you are dead to sinne. There are none that heares mee this day, but they professe they hope to bee saved by Christ, and they looke for no other name under Heaven to bee saved by, but the name of Jesus. It is certain, but who will Christ save? they are such as whom hee sanctifies; and will hee sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie such as by union with him are dead to sinne, and alive to God? Then I beseech you make this good to your selves, strive more, and more to kill sinne; take this as a quickning argument, that you are in Christ, and therefore you must bee conformable to Christ. Sayth the Apostle, <hi>Hee bore our sinnes in his bodie on the Tree, 1 Pet. 2. 24. that wee might be dead to sinne, and live to righteousnesse:</hi> Why <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 24.</note> did Christ beare your sinnes in his bodie upon the Tree? but for this very end; that as hee dyed for sinne, you might dye to sinne. Now that wee may perswade you, know that it is upon speciall <note place="margin">No losse in dying to sin.</note> ground, you lose nothing, but get much by it; the more you dye to sin, the lesse you lose by it.</p>
                  <p>First, you shall not lose any thing that is comfortable, and good, you shall not lose life by it; nay indeed the more you sinne, the <note place="margin">1. Not life,</note> more you die; every sinne is deadly, and mortall, every sin tends to your destruction, to the taking away of life, this is certaine. Therefore looke as a man when hee is in a mortall dangerous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, that every man concludes, if the disease prevaile hee will dye; nay, it hath so farre prevailed, that it will bee the death of him: you need no more to perswade him to spend all his estate upon Physitians to cure that disease. Now the sinnes that you cannot endure should bee reproved, that you cannot abide to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; they will be death in the end, your eternall death, therfore labour especially against them: When wee diswade you from sinne, and perswade you to purge out sinne, wee perswade you to your cure, to bee free from your disease, to be free from that that will end in death.</p>
                  <p>You shall not lose any rest and peace by it: the more you mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie <note place="margin">2 Not peace.</note> sinne, the more rest and peace you shall have; nay, the more sinne rules, the lesse rest and peace, <hi>There is no peace to the wicked:</hi>
                     <pb n="744" facs="tcp:14764:367"/>
but they are as the troubled waves of the Sea, that alway foame, and cast up myre and dirt, as the Prophet speakes, such is the rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse agitation of a man that goes on in sinne, he is ever restlesse, and unquiet. Would you have peace, and quiet? get out sinne that hinders all peace and quiet.</p>
                  <p>Againe, you shall not lose outward good things, not credite, <note place="margin">3. Not esteeme.</note> and name, and esteeme. Nay, what dishonours you, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth you to reproach, and shame, and obliquie, is it not sinne? For, what is it that men are evill spoken of, is it not for this, and that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular evill? Doe you love your name? avoide sinne, sinne will end in shame, it is the issue, the fruit of it. God will give you honour with his servants, nay, even in the hearts of the wicked. You know the more men strive to mortifie their sinnes, the more the world reprocheth them ordinarily: but wee must not judge what men doe in their jollitie, and in their passion; but what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves doe, when they are upon the wracke of a troubled consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, upon their death-bed, oh then if they <hi>might die the death of the righteous,</hi> oh then they would they had lived the life of the righteous, or any thing then, if they had beene like such a one whom they scorned. This gained esteme of <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>Herods</hi> heart.</p>
                  <p>Againe, you shall not lose your wealth, your estate: all losses of estate that are judgements, and punishments, they are but the <note place="margin">4. Not wealth.</note> fruits of sinne, you shall keepe your estate, and keepe it with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as farre as it is good for you, your sinnes provoke God, even to curse your blessings.</p>
                  <p>You shall not lose your pleasure if you part with sinne; nay, <note place="margin">5. Not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</note> you shall gaine pleasures. All sorrow, and griefe of heart, and disquiet of spirit, that ariseth from terrour of conscience, are they not hence, because of sinne? Would you have joy, and pleasure unspeakable, and glorious? part from sinne, that is the cause of sorrow. When wee bid you part with sinne, we speake to you to <note place="margin">Sin a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse thing.</note> part with a needlesse thing, it is a superfluitie, as well as hurtfull, superfluitie of malice, what need one sinne in the world? cannot you live, and be happy without it? cannot you live comfortably, and die blessedly without sinne? Nay, is it not that that hinders your blessednesse and happinesse? The Angels in heaven they are blessed, because they are without sinne: but those of them that sinned, they are <hi>reserved in chaines of darknesse, to the judgement of the great day. Adam</hi> in Paradise, in the state of innocencie; he was blessed, he was without sinne: but as soone as he sinned, hee was cast out of Paradise; and a Cherubin set with a flaming sword, to keepe the way of the Tree of life, that man should not come at it. You your selves, the best comfort, the best peace, the best evidences you have, are those that doe arise from your hatred of
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:14764:367"/>
sinne. Therefore doe but consider how needlesse a thing it is. Can you got any thing by it? can you live a day longer, or an houre more happy? can you be a whit better by it? If you could enjoy any present good by sinne, there were somewhat to bee pleaded: but what is it? you get a little wealth by unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, is it gaine? <hi>Iob</hi> saith, their belly shall be filled with gravell. If a man fill his belly with gravell, what hath hee gotten by it? you will get that that you must cast up againe: you get that that one day you will wish you had never knowne: as Israell when they turned to God, they should say of their garments of silver and gold, that they had made for their Idols, <hi>Get you hence.</hi> So every worldly man that raiseth his estate by unrighteous meanes, the time will come that hee shall wish all the money that he hath gotten were in the bottome of the Sea, that he had never knowne what a penney, or a house, or apparell had meant, that he hath gotten, or made, or appropriate to himselfe by any unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse whatsoever. What use is there of it? And will you lose your soules for that that is nothing? and will you lose hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for that that is needlesse? and eternall happinesse for that that will not doe you a moment of time, not a little present good, not a little present ease, not a little present comfort?</p>
                  <p>But lastly, the great benefit that redounds by it, that is spoken <note place="margin">2. The gaine by death to sin.</note> of in the Text, it is that you shall live, and <hi>live to God.</hi> The more you die to finne, the more you shall live to God through Jesus Christ. Now wee come upon a strong motive to perswade you to set more heartily against those evils that are daily reproved, the more you die to them, the more you shall live to God. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the worke of repentance be a hard taske, suppose it should be somewhat painfull; suppose it bee something that vexe and disquiet the naturall spirit of man: as there is paine in repentance, and mortification of sinne, yet neverthelesse if you may get eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life by it, is it not worth the while? Consider what you doe for naturall life, suppose a member of the body bee gangrened, that it is in danger to bee spread over the whole body, and the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of naturall life, the losse of a hand, and the losse of any member, though it bee never so usefull, rather then the body shall be in danger, and a man deprived of life, you will lose a use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full member: and when you have done, you doe it but in hope to preserve life: for you are not sure when you have cut off that member to live a day after: but yet because it is possible, because it is the way to naturall life: and yet if you have that life granted, suppose for terme of yeares, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had for fifteene yeares, yet it is but a naturall life, a life full of miserie, a life exposed to many vexations and disquiets, a life that hath so many troubles in it, that men in the best estate of health wish sometimes that they
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:14764:368"/>
were dead, through disquiets, and troubles, and yet for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of a troublesome life, if you were sure of that, you would lose a member. I know when we come, and speake of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing your former wayes, your covetousnesse, and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and pride, and vanitie, and wickednesse in any kinde, wee speake of cutting off of hands, of members of the bodie, they are so deare: therefore Christ saith, <hi>If thy hand offend thee, cut it off; if thine eye offend thee, pull it out;</hi> it is better to goe to heaven with one hand, then to hell with both. This I say, I know you apprehend it a hard lesson, there is no life, no Christ, without such a death to sinne. Yet it is a truth, and a necessarie truth for you to know, and therefore consider it, and that seriously what you lose. If we come and perswade you to cut off some usefull member, yet you yeeld to that for a naturall life: you will cut off a hand that is as usefull as any member of the body: but we bid you cut off su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous members, those needlesse members, the members of sinne that will be your death. Wee would have you but to be rid of the Ulcer, that is all we would have you deprived of, to preserve spirituall life, and to live to God. If I were to speake for a naturall life, it were but temporall, it were but upon conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: but we speake for a life upon certaintie. When wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade you to die to sinne, that you may live to God; wee assure you that this will certainly follow on it, you shall live to God, if sinne die in you, and we speake not only upon certaintie, but for eternitie too, you shall doe it for eternitietoo, you shall doe it for eternitie: it is not a life that ends. Nay, wee speake for a life wherein there is true happinesse, that hath no mixture of miserie to make you wearie, but a life that hath perfect peace and joy: a life that hath blessednesse begun, and shall have blessednesse perfected in heaven: this life we perswade you to live.</p>
                  <p>Consider now what we say, if there were more, you shall live to God the more you die to sin, <hi>Skin for skin</hi> (saith <hi>Iob) and all that a man hath he will give for his life:</hi> but if it be such a life as this, to live to God, a spirituall life; what? to live as the Angels doe, that live with God! to live as the Saints in Heaven, that live in the fruition and sight of God, wherein they are blessed! such a life we perswade you to.</p>
                  <p>A life infinitely above this, if this life had all the contentment the earth could give it, it were not worthy to be compared, though a man might live a thousand yeares in the confluence and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all prosperitie, it were not to be compared with one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the happinesse of the spirituall life that we shall live in for all eternitie with Christ. Now consider, take things, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them together; here is such a particular sinne that I was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to, to pride, to covetousnesse, to prophanenesse, to wickednesse
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:14764:368"/>
of this sort or of that sort, if I goe on in it, I die eternally, I lose God, and heaven, and my soule, and happinesse: what shall I get by this when I have done it? I gratifie Satan, I destroy my soule, I have lost my selfe and am undone for ever. And what a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is this for a man to venture the eternall ruine and destruction of himselfe, and that for a thing of nothing, for that that will make him miserable now, and more miserable eternally.</p>
                  <p>Consider, and know to whom I speake, I speake to yon that have heard the Word, and many times received the Sacrament. What did you when you received the Sacrament? was it not a pledge to you of your interest in Christ, and of your union with him? and that Christ is as truely united with you, as that you ate and dranke? Now let it appeare, make you account, whatsoever you were before make you account, reckon ye, goe not by guesse and say, I hope it will be better with mee then it hath beene; no, but reckon, conclude, make accompt, I must be another man, I may not be what I was, I must leave those things that are ill; I must apply my selfe to another course; Indeed I walked in a way of enmitie to the wayes of God, in estrangement from God, in worldly wicked wayes, but it must not now bee so, I must make account now that Christ is mine, I am now dead to sinne, and therefore dead to sinne, that I may live to God: if there bee any life of grace in me, it will appeare by my death to sinne. I must must make account of this, I must doe this, and this is the best way of making a right use of the Sacrament. Why are men as bad after the Sacrament as before? because they reckon not, they make not account for themselves, that they are dead to sinne. Make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you have received life from Christ, and you must act that life, and now set your selves to it, reason with your owne hearts, why doe I thus, and thus? As <hi>Ezra</hi> reasons, <hi>Ezra 9. 13. Lord,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ezra. 9 13.</note> 
                     <hi>since thou hast kept us from being beneath for our iniquities, should wee sinne more?</hi> So consider, hath the Lord kept me from hell, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me to his Table, where he hath spoken peace to mee, hee hath spoken reconciliation in Christ, shall I returne to sinne against him? certainly he will be more angrie now then ever he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: the sinnes that I commit now, will bee greater then all the sinnes I have committed hitherto; for now I sinne against more grace, and against greater mercie: for God hath againe renewed the Covenant of peace, whereas he might have cast me off for my former breach, and shall I provoke him againe? hath the Lord washed mee, and shall I defile my selfe againe? God forbid. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with your selves, I must not be as I was: it is not for mee to doe as others that know not God, and that are not in Covenant with God, or as I was wont to doe before; I know what it is to bind my selfe in covenant, to receive the Sacrament, I must be in
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:14764:369"/>
another fashion, and course of life, then ever I have beene. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when temptations come to sinne: for you must not thinke to be rid of all motions, and temptations to sinne: and whensoever there comes new temptations, not to conclude you have received the Sacrament in vaine, say not so, but rather say, now comes the tryall; this is that whereby God will trie what fruit comes, of the cost and paines, and mercies he hath bestowed on mee; here is a messenger sent for fruit. If I can withstand the commands of sinne, and resist the motions, and looke on it as a hatefull thing, I make it manifest that I am indeed dead to sinne, as the Scripture saith here, reckon that you are dead to sinne.</p>
                  <p>Therefore as when a man is delivered from being a Galley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave under the Turkes, and his ransome is paid: if his old Master come, and command him to the Galleyes: hee saith no, my ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some is payd, I am free, and I will not any more bee a slave. So reckon thou art no more to be such as thou wert wont to be: for now reckon your selves, saith the Apostle, if you be in Christ, <hi>that you are dead to sin, and alive to God, through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi>

                  <p>The first Assertion wee make out of the Text, it is this, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The faithfull are hopefull.</hi> The godly have hope; <hi>wee have hope,</hi> that is taken for granted.</p>
                  <p>The second, concerneth <hi>the object</hi> of this hope; and the Point is this, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Christ is the object of the Christians hope. We have hope in Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third, is touching <hi>the time</hi> of our hope, and that is for this life; the Lesson is this, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This life-time, is our hope-time. We have hope in this life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth is, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hope in this life, it is not onely of the things of this life.</hi> Not onely of this life; <hi>for if in this life onely we have hope:</hi> oh no, take that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, our <hi>hope in this life,</hi> is not onely set upon the things of this life. <hi>If in this life onely;</hi> not so.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, this life, you see how that standeth convertible with another terme in the Text, with miserie; shewing thus much, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This life is miserable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="753" facs="tcp:14764:371"/>
The last is, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The faithfull, the hopefull, they are not of all the most miserable, they are not miserable at all Then were wee miserable,</hi> but the former being not true, that cannot bee true. These are the sixe Points.</p>
                  <p>Of which, to content my selfe with a touch of them as I passe along, and so onely to present them severally unto you, I begin with the first, that</p>
                  <p>The faithfull, they are hopefull. <note place="margin">1 <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>he faithfull are hopefull.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We have hope,</hi> so are the words; <hi>Faith is the evidence of things hoped for,</hi> so sayth the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. And <hi>they that have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse through this Grace, they rejoyce in hope of the glorie of God:</hi> they <note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> goe joyned together.</p>
                  <p>Hope is <hi>a constant expectation of the performance of such promises of God, as we apprehend out of his Word, by faith.</hi> For example. <note place="margin">Definition of Hope.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Faith, doth beleeve Gods promises to bee true; Hope, doth expect the performance of them according to that truth.</p>
                  <p>By Faith, wee beleeve God to bee our Father; by Hope, wee expect that he should shew himselfe such a one to us.</p>
                  <p>By Faith, wee doe beleeve eternall life; by Hope, wee attend when this life shall bee revealed. <hi>Spe,</hi> (as one speakes) what is it else, but <hi>perseverantia fidei,</hi> the perseverance of Faith. Faith is the Mother, Hope is the Daughter; the Mother is incouraged and comforted by the Daughter, as <hi>Naomi</hi> was by <hi>Ruth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that the holy Apostle Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> hee ascribeth the <note place="margin">1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>et. 1. 9.</note> salvation of our soules to our faith; saying, that <hi>the end of our faith, is the salvation of our soules:</hi> Well and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> hee assureth the <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 24.</note> same to belong unto Hope; saying, <hi>we are saved by Hope.</hi> So then, Faith sayth, I beleeve these blessed promises of God to bee true; and Hope sayth, I see them, and I waite for the enjoyment of those things that are reserved formee: Thus Faith, and Hope, are wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven one in another: Thus <hi>the faithfull, are the hopefull: Wee have Hope.</hi> That's the first Point.</p>
                  <p>The Use of this Point breifly, it shall be but this; First, to teach <note place="margin">Vse.</note> us to seeke and to finde out this Hope in our selves. And secondly to strive and to fight against some impediments that oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and are hindrances of this Hope.</p>
                  <p>First, thou must go and seeke thy selfe, and search out and find, <note place="margin">1. Tryall of Hope.</note> whether thou hast this Hope in thee, yea, or no: and thou must be sure, that thou beest so farre from being a desperate past-hope, like <hi>Cain;</hi> that rather thou <hi>beleeve,</hi> and hope <hi>above hope,</hi> with <hi>Abraham;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 18.</note> not presuming, but beleeving as hee did</p>
                  <p>Now then, how a man may know whether hee have this Hope in him or no; I thinke he may find it out thus, in few words.</p>
                  <p>There are divers temptations, and especially three of a mans faith; (not to enlarge my selfe further) in every of which, Hope
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:14764:372"/>
if it come in and play its part, then it doth appeare to bee present, to bee there. As for example.</p>
                  <p>The first temptation, that is a kinde of batterie against the strong hold of a mans faith; it is the <hi>prorogation of Gods promises;</hi> Hee is pleased to put them off longer, and to dispose of them many times other waies then wee looke for: Hereupon, wee that are weake in Faith, wee stumble at it; and wee would hasten them on apace, though wee know what the Prophet sayth, <hi>Hee that beleeveth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not haste:</hi> But we are such faithlesse persons, that wee hasten <note place="margin">Isa. 21. 16.</note> on too much; and would have God to come apace to make good his promises. Now when God deferres these promises, if a man commeth in with his hope, and sayth; <hi>The vision is yet for an appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Hab. 2. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>time, though it tarrie, waite; for that that shall come, will come, and hee will not tarrie:</hi> and <hi>though the Lord doth hide himselfe,</hi> (as it is in <note place="margin">Isa. 8. 17.</note> the Prophesie of <hi>Isaiah) yet hee will returne againe:</hi> If Hope will <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 9.</note> prompt Faith, and tell it <hi>that the Lord is not slacke as some count slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> but hee will make sure his promise in the end; then this is a manifest signe to a man that hath his faith thus supported, that Hope is present there. Here is then one search of it.</p>
                  <p>Another time, there is another temptation that betideth a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man; and that comes to passe, by <hi>Gods appearing</hi> in a manner <hi>an enemie,</hi> by visiting him in his soule, by wounding his conscience, by setting him in a kinde of sight of Hell, when hee is distressed in spirit; as if God were now come out <hi>as a man of Warre</hi> against him, and would not have mercie upon him. Now if Hope can come in <note place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>l. 73. 9.</note> and say, that <hi>God cannot forget to bee gracious, nor cannot shut up his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindnesse in displeasure;</hi> and therefore I will endure, and I will stay on the Lord, for <hi>Hee will appeare,</hi> and <hi>Hee will have mercy</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 102. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>upon Zion;</hi> I, <hi>when the time, the appoynted time commeth,</hi> I will stay this time. If I say, Hope thus perswadeth the faithfull man of this goodnesse of God that shall bee revealed to him, here is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest signe, Hope is present.</p>
                  <p>There is a third temptation that Faith meets withall, and that is concerning <hi>the mockings of men in the World,</hi> when they deride the profession of Christians and faithfull men; and will say as those profane and profuse fellowes in the Epistle of Saint <hi>Peter, Where is the promise of his comming?</hi> it is so long since his promise <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 3.</note> was made, and yet there is none of his comming, <hi>Wilt thou still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thine integritie?</hi> (right <hi>Iobs</hi> Wife, as shee speakes to him) <note place="margin">Iob. 2. 9.</note> wilt thou still retaine thy trust? to what purpose is it? <hi>It is in vaine to serve the Lord,</hi> (as those wicked ones speake in <hi>Malachie.)</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mala. 3. 14.</note> Now if Hope will come in and say, notwithstanding all these things, yet <hi>passe by bad report, and good report;</hi> be of <hi>Davids</hi> minde, <hi>I</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cot. 6. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>will yet bee more vile before the Lord, that chose mee before thee and thy</hi>

                     <hi>fathers house;</hi> and I will stand it out, notwithstanding all the
<pb n="755" facs="tcp:14764:372"/>
mockings of men. Here is a manifest signe that there is Hope.</p>
                  <p>Thus you may seeke to find this grace in your selves; and you shall find it by many such kind of assaults, as these which Faith meeteth withall.</p>
                  <p>Now as you are to find it, so you are to fight against the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> of this Hope. And the hinderances of a mans hope, are sometimes <hi>slavish feare;</hi> sometimes <hi>an impatient spirit,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even <hi>Death</hi> it selfe, and that is a tedious affront indeed that Hope meeteth withall.</p>
                  <p>First <hi>Feare,</hi> a kind of passion and perturbation of the spirit of a <note place="margin">Hindrances of hope.</note> man, that makes his griefe begin, before his affliction comes upon him: this same <hi>Feare hath</hi> a great deale of <hi>painfulnesse</hi> in it. Where <hi>the fearfull are,</hi> they are shut out with the unfaithfull; and <hi>without</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 John 4. 18. Rev. 21. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>shall bee dogges,</hi> with those that are subject to this fearefulnesse. Now Hope commeth to a man and saith, Though I sometime be afraid, yet put I my trust in God, and therefore <hi>I will not feare</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal, 118. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>what man can doe unto mee,</hi> I will not be daunted with any kind of slavish terrour. Hold out thou that sayst thou hast faith, and bee not afraid of <hi>the Arrow that flies by day,</hi> nor of <hi>the terrour by night.</hi> Here is the hinderance of this hope taken away. <note place="margin">Psal. 91. 5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then there is <hi>an impatient spirit,</hi> that many times possesseth men. An impatient spirit, and a hopefull heart, they are both as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as can be; You shall have many a man so touchy, that hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure any delay, he must have things come according to his owne mind, or he loseth his patience presently. Oh but <hi>I will pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 40. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>waite for the Lord,</hi> saith hope. And here is the opposition that must be made for the maintenance of this hope against all kind of impatiencie: <hi>In patience possesse your soules.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 21. 19. 1 Cor. 15. 16.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The last hinderance, is <hi>death. The last enemie that shall be destroyed is death.</hi> Wee have many enemies in this world, <hi>our</hi> very <hi>life is a warfare;</hi> but amongst all the fightings and combates wee meete with in the world, there is none comparable to this last single combate we must undergoe with death it selfe; this is a terrible as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault that betideth the hopefull, faithfull man; to know that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all his faith, and all his hope, and all his love, and all his patience, what grace or vertue soever hee hath else, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he must goe <hi>downe to the grave, make his bed in the</hi>

                     </gap> the dust; and when he hath fought all that he can, yet notwithstanding hee must downe, he must yeeld, hee must take the foyle, the fall in the body howsoever the soule escapeth. Now here is a kind of dismaidment of hope. But I will tell you how it is spoken of the faithfull, and so of the hopefull. The faithfull are said to <hi>endure as seeing him that is invisible:</hi> how <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 27:</note> doe they endure? by the supplie of hope: for this hope is it that makes the faithfull against all hinderances to fight it out, so as that
<pb n="756" facs="tcp:14764:373"/>
                     <hi>they would not bee delivered,</hi> as it is spoken in the Epistle to the <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 35.</note> Hebrewes.</p>
                  <p>And shall death separate us from that we hope for? No saith the hopefull man, it shall not. Yea, so farre he is from being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to submit himselfe to this way, as knowing it to bee the way whereby he commeth to that he hopeth for, as that he is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and greedy of death: it is the way to that I hope for, saith he: therefore it is sweetly spoken of an Ancient, and you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it to be a sweet sentence of that Father Saint <hi>Austin, Hee that desireth to bee dissolved</hi> (according to that of the Apostle) <hi>and to bee with Christ, Non patienter moritur, Hee doth not die patiently.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23.</note> See, here is a faithfull, a hopefull man, and yet doth not die pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently: what would <hi>the Father</hi> say? <hi>Hee liveth</hi> (saith he) <hi>patiently,</hi> the very life he liveth putteth him to his patience; when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to die, <hi>hee dieth pleasantly;</hi> he goeth away with his hope, and his hope is full of immortalitie. And no more for that point.</p>
                  <p>The nex thing I observe, is concerning the <hi>Object</hi> of this hope, and this is it, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Christ is the Object of the Christians hope. We have hope in Christ.</hi>

                  <p>In the speciall: heare it in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> heare it in the Prophets, and others. Saint <hi>Paul, to mee to live is Christ, to die is gaine; Christ</hi>

And so, <hi>let him slay me</hi> if hee will (saith holy <hi>Iob) yet</hi> notwithstanding <hi>I will</hi> still <hi>trust in him.</hi> Thus <note place="margin">Job 13. 15.</note> the faithfull have hope, and their hope is in Christ. No more of it for the enlargement of it.</p>
                  <p>It sheweth to us in the first place this Note, that <hi>A Christians</hi>

                     <hi>it selfe</hi> sayth the Psalmist. Being sicke hee flieth not to the Physitian, he fleeth to these as the meanes, not to rest in them, to make it the maine of his aime, the scope of his hope, hee doth not flie thus to them, but hee goeth to God that commandeth all, that worketh above all, against all and without all means, and sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all these means: Therfore wel sayth the poore man, God is my help; and the sick man, God is my health; and the weak man, God is my strength; and the blinde man, Christis my light; and even the dead man, the distrest man, God is my life, &amp; the good man, Christ is my Hope; and the happie man, Christ is my love. And so it is to Christ, that the wings of a mans Hope doth lift him up. This is the first, It sheweth us that the wings of Hope that is in the faithfull soule, lifteth him up above all meanes.

Put <note place="margin">Eccles. 1.</note> the case thou art a sicke man, or a sicke woman, and I finde thee much affected, afflicted, dejected, cast downe in thy selfe; I would faine give thee some comfort now, I tell thee of the vanitie of this present life; therfore being content, I tell thee of the hope of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life; I tell thee of the joyes that are to be revealed; I tell thee of the promises of God which hee will make good to thee, if thou wilt trust in his mercie; I tell thee of all <hi>the sure mercies of David,</hi> as they are called: and all this while I have told thee nothing at <note place="margin">Isa. 55. 4.</note> all to comfort thee, till I come to this, the object of this Hope which I have in hand, and that is Jesus Christ, <hi>in whom all Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are Yea, and Amen;</hi> and till thou canst learne this lesson of <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 20.</note> life concerning the Lord Jesus, thou hast learned nothing; come and learn this, and my life for thine thou art then happy: He is <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</hi> the Way, and Truth, and Life it selfe, <note place="margin">Iohn 14. 6.</note> and <hi>whether shall I goe</hi> from thee Lord? <hi>thou hast the words of eternall life.</hi> I have done with that Point, and so passe on to the third. <note place="margin">Job. 6. 68.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee have <hi>Hope;</hi> wee have <hi>Hope in Christ;</hi> wee have <hi>Hope in Christ in this life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This life-time then is our hope-time;</hi> that is it you learne hence. <note place="margin">3. <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> This life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time is our hope-time;</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we have the feed of Hope, but the harvest of Hope, that is hereafter: when wee shall have in <hi>re,</hi> what now we have in <hi>spe,</hi> as ordinarily wee speake: when wee shall have in possession what now wee haue in expectation: then there will bee no more use
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:14764:374"/>
of this Grace, there hope shall cease. Now it is indeed in this life time, that wee sow the seedes of Prayer, that wee plant the roots of Faith, that wee water all of them with our hope: when our joy shall spring up, when the end and fruit of our faith shall come, when the possession of our hope shall appeare; then we have done with hope, hope serveth no longer then, therefore it is now in this life. Hope shall end for the action of it (understand that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right) as Faith shall; but it shall never end for the object of it, that end shall last still, and rest ever. Now then in the <hi>interim,</hi> this is the Prophets, and this is the Princes, and this is the Peoples <hi>posse,</hi> I wayte, and I wayte too, and I trust the Lord over all: Now is your <hi>posse</hi> time as I may call it; now is the seed time, wherein we sow the seeds of love, of joy, of hope, wherein we sow the seeds of sobrietie, and innocencie, and chastitie, and charitie, and all manner of vertues whatsoever, now is the time.</p>
                  <p>Is this so, then here is the issue of this plea: It is this; that <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> therefore now if ever, now or never, wee must seeke to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee have these seeds of Grace in us yea or no; Wee must get them, and wee must set them, and wee must see to them; both that they come up, and how they comeup, and how they come on. Now is the time when the speciall care must bee taken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these seeds of Grace. If wee will beleeve, wee must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve now, for hereafter there will bee no time to beleeve any more: If wee will bee children of Grace, wee must bee it now; for hereafter there will bee no space for Grace: therefore sayth the Lord, <hi>now, while hee will bee found,</hi> and hee will bee found of <note place="margin">Isa 55 6.</note> those that seeke him; and <hi>seeke him</hi> now, for <hi>now is the acceptable time, now is the day of salvation:</hi> when the date of this day, when the day of this life of salvation is downe, is past, then there is no more seeking, then there is no more finding; therefore if thou wilt be faithfull, bee it now; if thou wilt bee fruitfull, be it now, <hi>now wee are the Sonnes of God;</hi> as if hee should say, if we bee not the <note place="margin">1 John 3. 2.</note> Sonnes of God now, we shall never be.</p>
                  <p>Is this so, adde a further degree to this dutie in the next place, and that is; when you have gotten these seeds in you, to examine <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> &amp; prove your selves whether they be there; not only so, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they abide there; not only so but whether they live there; and not only so, but whether they grow and live there: they must not only be, but they must continue there and abide; and they must not only be, and abide, but they must be alive there and not dead; and they must not only be alive, but they must thrive too, and not be idle: for <hi>if these things be in you, they will make you neither idle, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull</hi>

                     <hi>Iames</hi> explodeth it for a Jest, that any Christian should thinke so.

Wilt thou have Christ to bee the object, either of thy faith or hope, and wilt thou not grow then in these? <hi>Non progredi est regredi, Not to goe forward, is to goe backward;</hi> and not to grow the better, is to grow the worse.</p>
                  <p>The contemplation of these two points should teach Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, a Christian sedulitie, to kindle, to keepe that grace that is in them; and it should kill carnall securitie.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Christian sedulitie, a care, a strife, an industrie, an ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be Christians indeed, to improve their talents; <hi>Let every</hi>

                     <hi>man in that calling whereto hee is called, therein abide;</hi> he must not give it out: Is <hi>Archippus</hi> called to be a Minister? then <hi>say to Archippus,</hi>

                     <hi>take heed to the ministrie that thou hast received, that thou fulfill it;</hi> and so it belongeth to every man else to performe the dutie and office of his place, and not to goe backwards, but to use diligence, and endevour for the increasing of his gifts, that he be not barren, not unfruitfull in Gods Vineyard.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It serveth on the other side to kill that carnall securitie that is in men. It is a strange thing to conceive, that Christians are growne to such securitie as they are, that they should bee so supine and negligent in their services: I say it is a lamentable case; and I doe wonder the more, that they should be taken with this kind of transgression, when I consider that saying of a Father, that there is securitie in no place: there is no securitie in heaven, nor in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, much lesse in the world; in heaven the Angels fell; in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise <hi>Adam</hi> fell; in the world <hi>Iudas</hi> fell; <hi>Iudas,</hi> I hee fell from the institution of the best Schoole and Schoole-master that ever was in the world; there is no manner of teacher comparable to him. Therefore, I say, mixe with thy hope a certaine feare, and bee so farre from a carnall presumption, as that thou maintaine in thy
<pb n="760" facs="tcp:14764:375"/>
selfe a holy feare of falling; for it hath so come to passe, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> indeed was, what he was not, of a persecutor hee became an Apostle; hope lies there-away: but <hi>Iudas</hi> was what hee did not appeare to be, and of an Apostle became an Apostate; feare lies there-away. And thou that hopest that of a persecutor, thou maist turne an Apostle; feare lest by falling away, thou maist of an Apostle become an Apostate, a persecutor. I will not stand upon these things any longer.</p>
                  <p>I have passed three, the fourth Conclusion is, that</p>
                  <p>Hope in this life is not only for the things of this life. <note place="margin">4. <hi>Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Hope is not for the things of this life.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If in this life only wee have hope, then are wee miserable;</hi> as if hee should have said, if in this life only, for the present, we had hope, and that the end of all our hope, and all our desire, were fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the present world, then were we poore Christians most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; for none in the world are more despised, contemned, scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; none more afflicted, troubled, grieved in their soules for their sinnes then they, alwayes followed with outward fights, with inward frights, when other men enjoy the world at will: so that the scope of this Scripture is to say, that not for this life only have we hope in Christ; that is the very meaning; that the godly, the faithfull, the hopefull, they have not their portion in this life; <hi>Wee know when this earthly tabernacle is dissolved, wee have a building made with God, a house not made with hands, eternall in the heavens, whose builder and maker is the Lord;</hi> so speakes the Apostle to the <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 1.</note> Corinths.</p>
                  <p>As for this life, if we should lay the foundation of our hope here, alas, they might rue their miserable case that so doe; they might hang downe their heads, that are godly, with shame and griefe enough to themselves; but it is here they set up their hope, here they have hope, but it is hope here for another life; it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other things that their hope is fixed then are here below; it is for things that they looke for, it is not for things that they see, for <hi>hope that seeth is no more hope, but if wee with patience waite for the things that are not seene, this is hope,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>So that this is a very plaine case, and might be further cleared, and declared to us from the practice, and common opinion of all the Saints of God in all Ages, how they have hoped, and how that their hope was in God; that they should <hi>see the Lord,</hi> but where? <hi>in the land of the living:</hi> here they have a sight too, but the chiefest hope is on the Promise, and that is not for the things of this life only, but for the life to come; <hi>Hee that putteth his trust in mee shall possesse the land, and shall inherit my holy mountaine;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa; 57. 13:</note> their hope is in the end, that is of those things that they shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in the end of this life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="761" facs="tcp:14764:375"/>
The consideration of this Point, that hope it is not onely for the <note place="margin">Vse.</note> things of this life, may teach us to contend against death it selfe, which is one of the strongest temptations against hope, as I touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, and to contemne and dispise all the things of this life.</p>
                  <p>It teacheth a man to strive and wrestle and contend against <note place="margin">1.</note> death, why? because though a man doe die, yet it shall not hinder his hope, it shall not hinder him from that hee hopeth to attaine. Death is the greatest amazement a man can meet withall in the World, but what can Death doe? well may it take away from a man his life, but it cannot take away from him his love; well may it take away from him the action of his hope here, it shall cease, but it shall never take away from him the object of his hope, that which he hopeth for, it shall continue; well may it helpe him to it, but it can never hinder him from it: here is then comfort and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in the very houre, and power of death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A man learneth here to contemne, and to dispise the things <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> of this life, specially if they be such manner of things as will come in comparison with their betters, when baser things will compare with better things: in this kinde of comparison now a mans hope should take him off, and not so much as suffer him to leane to any kind of reasoning that is made against his hope. Hope biddeth him not to trust, not to looke to any thing that is in this life, because it doth not at all concerne that which is the ayme he hath. The very best things that bee in this life, they are not worthie to bee hoped for after; insomuch, that even death it selfe it may be counted a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, and not a penaltie. God will have a mans life to be short, and death to come soone; because hee will not have his creature worne out with a tedious miserie, and transitorie vanitie; a vanity of miserie, that is in this vaine miserable life of mortalitie. I have done with the fourth.</p>
                  <p>A fifth thing that followeth in the Text (that I may haste on) we have <hi>Hope,</hi> wee have <hi>Hope in Christ,</hi> we have <hi>Hope in Christ in this life;</hi> our hope in this life is not upon the things of this life, for <hi>if it were in this life onely, it were miserable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Our life is a miserie;</hi> There is the fifth. <note place="margin">5. <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> Our life is a miserie.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is a certaine truth; and it will plainely appeare to us in many passages; if wee will beleeve either the Spirit of God, or the experience of the godly. I shall not need to stand to prove it: You will aske me, how it will be raised from this place?</p>
                  <p>Thus, <hi>Wee are of all men the most miserable,</hi> because that wee are mentioned amongst the number of those that are the more mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; it implieth, that all the rest are miserable more or lesse: the very comparison that is used, doth manifestly declare unto us that there is a measure of miserie to every man living: so then there is miserie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="762" facs="tcp:14764:376"/>
2 It appeareth out of the Text, because here and else where; you shall have man and miserie made termes convertible: Man is named <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> is <hi>miserie:</hi> Man, and miserie so joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that there is no pulling them asunder till death parts them, for then there is no more miserie.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Because that miserie here; our being <hi>miserable in this life,</hi> is mentioned even with the very best things of this life: the very best things that are in this life, and of this life, so long as they look to this life, I say they are stiled miserable; but the best things, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Christ himselfe, our <hi>Hope</hi> it selfe; say what you can, here is <hi>Hope,</hi> and here is <hi>Christ</hi> in the Text, and yet notwithstanding here is miserie too. Now then wee reason thus; that if the best things in this life bee miserable, then the rest are no better then so: that the best are no better, it is plaine; because let us have what wee would have in all the World, yet so long as wee are here it is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie.</p>
                  <p>If this bee so, then wee must come to the conclusion wee have made, and that is <hi>Iacobs</hi> conclusion, <hi>Gen. 47. 9. Few and evill have the dayes of the yeares of my life beene,</hi> it is <hi>Iobs</hi> conclusion too, <hi>Mans life is full of miserie:</hi> It is <hi>Davids</hi> in the Psalmes, <hi>Mans life is full of</hi>

                     <hi>labour and sorrow, it is soone cut off, and wee flie away; our dayes come to an end as a tale that is told, they passe away as a shadow, and the beautie,</hi> the best of them, <hi>withereth as grasse:</hi> It is <hi>Solomons,</hi> hee was the Preacher, and here is his Text; all is vaine, and vanitie, <hi>Vanitie of vanities, all is vanitie,</hi> one thing and other, <hi>every thing under the Sun,</hi> our life it selfe, our selves, so long as wee are here wee are under the Sun, hee calleth all vanitie: And sayth the Apostle, <hi>This I say Brethren, the time of our life is short: And what is our life</hi> sayth <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 29</note> Saint <hi>Iames? But a vapour that appeareth for a little while, and then vanisheth away;</hi> it is a vapour that vanisheth, a meoter of miserie. <note place="margin">Iam. 4. 14.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>What shall we say of this now? (to speak it in few words home to our selves,) somewhat may concerne our selves, and somewhat <note place="margin">Vse.</note> as we respect and reflect upon others.</p>
                  <p>In regard of our selves, it may have this double Vse. First to weane us from the World, Secondly to winne us to the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 To weane us from the World: The World considered in it <note place="margin">1.</note> selfe is so full of miserie, that there is nothing to bee delighted in: there is so much bitternesse, that I warrant it will weane any Child from it that is not a worldling, for hee indeed is at his own breasts with his owne Mother: But consider the World as it is in it selfe, and there is nothing in it, but true bitternesse, and false sweetnes, certaine paine, and uncertaine pleasure; tedious labour, and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous rest; nothing in the World but vanitie and miserie: for saith Saint <hi>Iohn, Love not the World, hee that makes himselfe the friend of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 John 2. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>God, makes himselfe an enemie to the World.</hi> O you lovers of the

World (sayth Saint <hi>Austin)</hi> I wonder at you! O foolish men! who hath bewitched you? for what wrestle you? why doe you strive and contend so much? what thing is their in the World that is worthie your labour? there is (sayth hee) nothing in the World but that which is foolish, and frothie, and frayle, and false, and vaine, and full of danger, full of disaster; suffer your selves therefore to bee weaned from the World.</p>
                  <p>And yet notwithstanding all that wee can say, wee know there are some persons that will not bee taken off from the Worlds breasts, they have a better opinion of it then so. Let such enjoy their owne errour till they runne to ruine, and till their owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow take them off: Yet notwithstanding wee know that which an Ancient hath, that <hi>to whom God is once sweet, the World must needs bee bitter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 On the other side, the knowledge of this serveth to winne us to the Lord; that as the one draweth us off, so the other may <note place="margin">2.</note> drive us on. When I consider the mercies of the Lord, and <hi>the goodnesse of God in the land of the living:</hi> when I consider how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite he is in his love; I am ravished in spirit, I am taken up in the minde, and taken off in the flesh; I have set my heart and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on Heaven, and on heavenly things. And now when I think on the Lord, there is my hope, and there is my helpe; and there where my helpe is, there is my love, and there is my life, and there is my Lord, there is Christ at the right hand of God: <hi>Hee is the life of them that beleeve, hee is the resurrection from the dead;</hi> hee is the <note place="margin">Iohn 11. 25.</note> right hand where there is pleasure for evermore, for there shall be no more paine, no more death; <hi>for the first things are past away</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Revelation) and all things are become new.</hi>

                  <p>The comparing of these two things together, of this lifes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie, and that lifes felicitie and eternitie, would make a man sing and to sigh too. It would make him sing, I singing is in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and sighing is in the Tabernacle; singing in the Temple, <hi>Blessed are they that dwell in thy house, they shall be alwaies praysing thee;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 84:</note> here is singing: but sighing is in the Tabernacle, for <hi>while wee are in this Tabernacle,</hi> therefore <hi>sigh wee, desiring to be dissolved and to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven:</hi> for while wee are here we cannot be happie, <hi>for this life is miserie,</hi> This bee spoken for our selves.</p>
                  <p>The second application of this plea is for others: seeing this life <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> is such a life of miserie, and that life is such a life of glory and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality; our present hap so base, our future hope so excellent: this should stay us and take us off from mourning for such as are departed, as if wee were without hope of them. Hope is in the Text the principall thing, and to lament and mourn for those that are departed, wee should bee so farre from it, as to rejoyce in our spirits for the blessed translation of such into eternall rest from this vale of miserie, I say we should rejoyce in their very translation.</p>
                  <p>What dost thou mourne and lament, and hang downe the head, and all for losse of such as are departed and gone to rest with God? Oh but thou wilt say, thou art not heavie for their gaine, but for thine owne losse: but seeing thy losse is the lesse, and their gaine the greater, why dost thou not observe a meane and a proportion in these things?</p>
                  <p>I confesse, it is very fitting both in Civility, and Divinity, and agreeable to the lawes both of Grace, and Nature, that there should be mourning, especially <hi>in the house of mourning,</hi> at times and occasions offered in this nature, it cannot otherwise be. But for <hi>Rachel</hi> to <hi>mourne for her Children,</hi> so as that <hi>shee would not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted;</hi> not but that shee could have beene comforted, but shee would not, that is not well. But I say here is comfort in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and here is that which must stay us from being transported with impatient griefe; wee must overcome all our griefe with patience, with a blessed expectation of our owne dissolution, for
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:14764:377"/>
we must thinke <hi>we shall goe to them, they shall not returne to us;</hi> let us <hi>desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, which is best</hi> for them, and for mee, I and for thee too. Enough of the fift Point.</p>
                  <p>The last, (which I will but name, that so I may runne through this whole Scripture at this time) is this, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The righteous and the hopefull, they are not miserable;</hi> they are not <note place="margin">6. <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> The hopefull are not mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</note> most miserable, not the most miserable of all, nay they are not miserable at all.</p>
                  <p>How prove you that?</p>
                  <p>By the force of the Argument here that the Apostle useth: for this being a part of an Argument, and an <hi>Hypotheticall</hi> proposition, he reasoneth thus: <hi>If in this life onely we have hope in Christ, then are we miserable,</hi> but now for this life onely we have not <hi>hope in Christ:</hi> he doth not set our rest there, therefore wee are not of all men the most miserable. How prove you that? because the most wicked, the most wretched; so the lesse wicked, the least wretched; and the most righteous, the best blest, and the least miserable.</p>
                  <p>Not <hi>the most?</hi> not at all. Not at all? No, for as the outward prosperitie of the wicked in this World is no true prosperitie, so the outward adversitie of the godly is no true miserie: it is not such as doth destitute and dissolute a man utterly, but you shall have the faithfull come off with hope, I and with rejoycing rather then grudging and repining at it; yea they joy in their sufferings, and at last <hi>are more then conquerours;</hi> and all this sheweth then, that that they are farre enough from miserie.</p>
                  <p>Well, the knowledge of this lifes miseri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And then lastly, this shall serve to shew to us, how it ought to keepe off the World from judging rashly: there is a great obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> and a perverse judgement in the World; men censure those that are in any kinde of miserie to bee of all men the most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: whereas we know that this is no true misery on their part, for it is but outward, it is but temporall misery, it is no true reall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie.

Doth not the Lord say to his servant <hi>Moses, No man can see my face and live?</hi> Oh (sayth a Father) let mee dye <note place="margin">Exod. 33. 20.</note> then! for I will dye to see thee: who would not dye for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, to dwell ever where his hope is? <hi>If in this life we had onely hope, then were we of all men the most miserable:</hi> but our hope is not onely in this life of the things of this life; therefore wee are not of all men most miserable, no not miserable at all.</p>
                  <p>I have done with my Text: You see the occasion of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent meeting to Interre this little Child in Christian buriall, the last service and dutie we owe to deceased Saints: I cannot, and I know you expect not that I should say any thing of it. It is a Child of the Covenant, sealed in the Covenant, dyed in the Covenant, resteth according to the Covenant, with the God of the Covenant, of whom I doubt no more of a happy rest with <hi>Christ the mediatour of the Covenant,</hi> then I do of the Covenant that Christ hath sealed. and so I leave it in that rest, and returne our selves to our owne dutie and service, to call upon God for a blessing.</p>

There is a time for all things, there is a time to sow, and a time to reape.</hi> Now while the sowing time lasts (for that is the <hi>opportunitie</hi> that hee now speakes of) while the time of sowing lasts; let us embrace those times and opportunities for the doing of good.
<q>Let us (as wee have opportunitie) doe good to all.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doe good,</hi> is of a large extent, it is of as large an extent, as the law. All is good that is agreeable to Gods will revealed. <hi>Bee renewed in the spirit of your mindes, that you may know what the good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>will of God is.</hi> But in this place it is restrained to some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular acts of <hi>Beneficence</hi> towards men, towards the servants of God: which are then said to be good deedes, and good acts, when there is a concurrence betweene the action, and the affection, with conformitie to the Rule.</p>
                  <p>First, there must be actions. It is not speaking good, nor mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">1 Jam. 2. 15, 16.</note> good only, but it is doing good. Saith the Apostle, <hi>If a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be naked, or hungrie, or cold, and you say to him, goe in peace, warme thee, but you give him no fire: and goe and cloath thee, but you give him no apparell: and goe and feed thee, but you give him no meate.</hi> Here are good words now: but the deedes are not answerable; here are no good deedes at all. <hi>Solomon</hi> compares such comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall charitie, that is only verball, and in outward expression, to <hi>Cloudes and windes without raine.</hi> Not much unlike the boxes of <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> that are adorned with glorious tytles without, but open them, and examine the insides, you shall finde nothing but emptinesse. Well, that is the first thing: there must bee good actions.</p>
                  <p>Againe secondly, these must have a good rise, they must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <note place="margin">2.</note> from a good affection too: or else they lose the name of good actions. <hi>Make the tree good, and the fruit</hi> shall bee of the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: the actions are not good, if the affections bee naught, and therefore the same God, that requires <hi>beneficence,</hi> hee commands <hi>benevolence</hi> also, and would have men become tender-hearted, and <hi>put on the bowels of compassion:</hi> that they should Sympathize with others, and be like affectioned to them; to <hi>mourne with those that mourne,</hi> and to be with those that are bound, as being bound with them. This is that which our Saviour calls being mercifull. <hi>Bee</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 3. Rom. 12. 15. Mat. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>mercifull, as your heavenly Father is mercifull.</hi> Hee saith not only doe workes of mercie; but be mercifull, doe them from a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:14764:380"/>
heart, from bowels of compassion, that yearne towards those that are in necessitie. That is the second thing.</p>
                  <p>But then thirdly, these actions, and these affections whence <note place="margin">3.</note> they rise, they must hold conformitie with the Law. There is no good, but what is conformable to the rule of goodnesse: that is the written word of God: and therefore all those will-worships and idle ceremonies made according to the inventions of man; as a thousand devices in <hi>Poperie</hi> (wherein they intimate a show of great Liberalitie) they are not good deedes, because they want that good rule that should uphold and make them so. So much shall serve for the opening of it. Good deedes then are such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as rise from a sanctified affection; and receive ground and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from Gods will revealed in his Word to men.</p>
                  <p>Againe, there is a third terme yet. <hi>Doe good to all men;</hi> What doth the Apostle meane, that every man should receive the fruits of our <hi>Beneficence?</hi> There are some men notoriously wicked, and rather to be punished than relieved: The Apostle meanes not such, for hee gives you a Caution; <hi>If any man worke not, let him not eate.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Thes. 3. 10.</note> Relieve him not that hath abilitie to get, and will live idlie, and unprofitably; But doe good to all men; that is, to all men so farre as you see them in extreme want, unable to helpe themselves, if their lawfull necessities call upon your charitie, in this respect all men must be looked unto, but especially <hi>To the houshold of Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>houshold of faith,</hi> here he meanes the multitude of beleevers, and not only those that dwell neere us, and about us, but those that are dispersed throughout the whole earth, the Churches of God: The dispersion spoken of through all the parts of the world are this <hi>houshold of faith:</hi> all the Saints of God, in what difference or <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.</note> distance soever one from another, yet they are of the same hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold together; of the same Church of God. So the Church of God is called, <hi>the house of God;</hi> and sometime it is understood of the Church militant, and sometime of the Church triumphant. Of the Church triumphant: <hi>In my Father <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> many mansions.</hi> There it is heaven, the place of the blessed. Then for the Church militant: <hi>Moses was faithfull in all his house,</hi> saith the Text. And <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothie</hi> how hee should carry himselfe in <hi>the house of God:</hi> that is in the Church militant. As for those that live above us, they need not our good workes and actions, therefore it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of those that are here in the Church militant; that is called Gods houshold, because there is such a communion amongst belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as amongst those that live in the same house, that abide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same roofe; that live under the same government, that eat at the same Table, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So then you have the meaning of all, which is no more but this; Take those advantages of times, which you can obtaine (or el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

in such actions of mercie which tend to the reliefe of tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> that want them. If there be extreme necessitie, doe good to all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if you may make choyce of persons to whom you may doe good: choose <hi>the houshold of faith.</hi> Thus you have the substance, and the meaning of the words. In them you may observe briefly these three parts.</p>
                  <p>The first is a determination, or limitation of time, to which the Saints are tyed in the performance of the duties that are injoyned <note place="margin">Division.</note> them: <hi>as you have opportunitie,</hi> and while you have time.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a declaration of dutie: <hi>doe good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is a description of the persons to whom this good must be done; first more generally: <hi>Doe good to all:</hi> and then more particularly, and with an especiall note; <hi>Especially to those of the houshold of Faith.</hi> Of these in order.</p>
                  <p>First, for the determination of time (to take the words as they lie) while you have time therefore, <hi>or as you have opportunitie,</hi> the words themselves doe render the maine point.</p>
                  <p>It is the dutie of Christians to take their advantages of times: to take the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the dutie of Christians to take the best opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of their life to doe good.</note> best opportunities of their life to doe good.</p>
                  <p>I will speake somewhat by way of Explication of the point; and something by way of Application, and so proceed to what followes.</p>
                  <p>First for the Explication: what is intended, or meant in it, when we incite you to embrace times and opportunities. Briefly these two things are meant in it.</p>
                  <p>First, that you should bee sure not to lose the time of <note place="margin">A twofold opportunitie to be taken of doing good.</note> life. And</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that you should not forgoe the advantages, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of estates.</p>
                  <p>You shall not alwayes have life to <hi>doe good:</hi> and it may bee (if you have life) you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>all not alwayes enjoy meanes, and abilitie to <hi>doe good.</hi> Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ou have life therefore, and time, <hi>doe good;</hi> or while you enjoy meanes: and so power to <hi>doe good:</hi> embrace these opportunities. That is the meaning of the Apostle in this place.</p>
                  <p>First, then there must be a doing good while you have life; let your good workes goe before you; doe things while you live, <note place="margin">1: The time of life.</note> and deferre not the performance of them till your death. <hi>Make you friends of the unrighteous Mammon, that when you want, they may</hi>

That when you want that power, and those times, you may enjoy the comfortable fruit of the well-redeeming of the time of your life, to <hi>receive you into everlasting habitations.</hi> In the 25. verse of the 16. <hi>Luke,</hi> it is the challenge of <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Dives; Sonne remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that thou in thy life-time, haddest thy goods,</hi> (for so the word signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth) thou haddest thy opportunities of life, and of goods too, but now thou hast neither life nor goods left thee, to doe good with; and therefore <hi>hee is blessed, and thou art tormented.</hi> It was the folly of those <hi>five Virgins.</hi> They tooke not the opportunitie of <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 10.</note> life (for that is the thing meant there) but they posted over all to the last, and hoped that all might bee effected in a trice or minute of their life, which would haue held them employment enough all the dayes of their lives: And therefore they came short of heaven; <hi>the gates were shut</hi> against them, as you see, when <hi>the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome came.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any man imagine, because it is said, <hi>Blessed are they that die in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obiection.</note> 
                     <hi>the Lord, for they rest from their labours, and their workes follow them.</hi> That therefore it matters not, so long as a man doth good at his death, though hee have neglected the wayes of goodnesse all his life.</p>
                  <p>Let them know that by works there, is not meant the actions <note place="margin">Answ.</note> of men, but the fruites of their actions. <hi>Their workes follow them;</hi> not the workes they have deferred untill death, but the fruites of those workes, they did while they were living, and received not the benefit of them untill death. Their workes follow them; that is the fruits of their workes. It is more good and pleasant by farre, to have the actions goe before, and the fruites, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table effects to succeed, and follow after.</p>
                  <p>But if any man yet suppose that hee may make that up in his <note place="margin">Obiection.</note> Will, which he hath neglected, all his life long: and though hee have lived miserably, covetously, and unprofitably, all the dayes of his life; yet his thoughts may tell him, that by the <hi>Charitable Bequests of his last Testament;</hi> as bequeathing largely to the Church and Common-wealth, and to all sorts of people, hee may at the last make fit compensation and satisfaction, for neglect of former duties.</p>
                  <p>Let no man deceive himselfe with such a bad resolution, for <note place="margin">Answ.</note> first it argues a signe of infidelitie, that a man will not trust God, for feare he should want in his life-time; what is the reason else that he deferres the doing good in health, unlesse it be for feare of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himselfe? such distrust hee hath in the providence of God. Besides, the same God which bids thee doe good when thou hast opportunitie, and while thou enjoyest the advantage of life, hee expects it now. And it may bee truly said of many that neglect those times of doing good while they lived, and have now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

                  <p>So much for the first point. I proceed unto the second; that is, thou must not only take the time of thy life, but also the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of thy meanes, and thy estate; while there is yet <hi>a price in</hi>

                     <hi>thine hand:</hi> while thou hast opportunitie, and enjoyest wealth to doe good with; redeeme the advantages and opportunities by employing them in that way, for which thou didst receive them. The time may come wherein you may desire to doe good, but cannot; wanting at estate, and opportunities whereby to doe it. Marke what <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Wilt thou trust in a thing of nothing? for Riches have wings as an Eagle, and flie away toward heaven.</hi> It is the <note place="margin">Prov. 23. 5.</note> vanitie of men, that they still forbeare, and stay, while their estates increase; pretending that then they shall bee better able to doe good, and extend themselves more largely: or that they may keepe their wealth, and waite for a better opportunitie. But <hi>why wilt thou trust in a thing of nothing?</hi> Thou seest a fowle in her flight, and now (it may be) thou perceivest it, but instantly it vanisheth out of thy sight. Why <hi>riches have wings</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon.)</hi> Thou hast them now in thy possession, and retainest them fast in hold, but presently they are departed; they flie as an <hi>Eagle</hi> out of thy sight. And the same wise man when he exhorteth men to <hi>cast their bread upon the waters;</hi> Hee gives them this reason: <hi>Thou knowest not</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 11. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>what evills;</hi> thou knowest not what judgements and calamities God intends to bring upon that Nation where thou livest; upon the Citie; upon the Familie where thou dwellest; upon thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or estate: <hi>Thou knowest not what evils God will bring upon the earth.</hi> And so likewise <hi>charge rich men in this world, that they hee not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded; and that they trust not in uncertaine riches, but in the living</hi>

                     <hi>God; that they bee readie to distribute, and to communicate, and to doe good workes.</hi> What is it that hinders men from distributing, and communicating? Because <hi>they trust in uncertaine Riches.</hi> For if they would now learne, not to <hi>trust in uncertaine Riches,</hi> but account them uncertaine as they are; and put confidence in the living God, who can provide for them, when those outward meanes (which they so much rely on) faile their expectations, they would then be more liberall, and bountifull, and readie to doe good, and to communicate. So then here is the meaning of the point.</p>
                  <p>Take the opportunities of life. That is, first take the time of life, while you may doe good; and then take the meanes, the wealth, and estate, which is the time of your meanes. For this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <hi>Iobs</hi> case, hee goes on discoursing of this very point, he was <note place="margin">Job 31. 15. 16, 17, 18.</note> now a man stript of all hee had, but the other day the Richest man in the East; the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="775" facs="tcp:14764:382"/>
Yet there was onething that administred comfort, in the day of his adversitie and his affliction, And it was this, saith he; <hi>If I have made the eyes of the poore to faile; or if I eate my morsels alone; or if I have not relieved the fatherlesse,</hi> &amp;c. If I have not done thus and thus; then let the Lords fiercest judgement fall upon mee; But herein consists my comfort, my conscience beares mee witnesse, that when I had wealth, and estate, and enjoyed the goods of this life, I did good. I was <hi>father to the fatherlesse; a foot to the lame, and eyes to the blind.</hi> I did all the good that lay within the compasse of my power to doe, when I had meanes to doe it. I say, little doe you know (beloved) whatsoever thou art, whatsoever estate thou hast; though thou be as a naile fastned in a sure place, and thinkest thou shalt never bee moved from this condition: Thou knowest not how soone God may turne his hand upon thee, when thou maist bee as <hi>Iob</hi> was on the dunghill deprived of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. What will be thy consolation then? that when thou hadst wealth, thou didst good with it. It will adde to thy affliction, that thou hadst great possessions, and didst neither glorifie God, nor doe good to men. So much for the opening of the point; I come to apply it.</p>
                  <p>First then, it serves for the reproofe of many to whom God <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> hath given the <hi>price in their hands:</hi> But <hi>they want hearts</hi> to embrace the opportunities of doing good. They pretend to doe good, and have a mind inclining to good: But they have no heart to take the opportunities, and advantages of times, and meanes, which God hath bestowed on them for the same purpose; they want hearts to embrace those. Remember what <hi>Solomon</hi> saith; <hi>Say not to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>thy neighbour, goe, and come againe to morrow, if it bee now in thine hands to give him.</hi> The Lord will not only have a man, not denie to doe good, but besides that, hee would not have him delay to doe good; put him not from thee till to morrow, if his helpe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in thine hands to day; yea, though thou have a purpose to doe it to morrow; if it be in thy power to day, doe it; and deferre it not till to morrow.</p>
                  <p>But what shall we say to those, who doe not only delay their purposes, but by protracting lose their purposes. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ordinarie, then in some cases for men; not only to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose truly, but to promise heartily to God, that they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme these, and these acts of mercy, if God will d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

A man that endures extremitie of weather, in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous Sea, if happily hee may attaine the land in safetie: a man that is diseased with sicknesse, if now he may recover his health againe, or one that suffers imprisonment, if he may procure his libertie: or a man that is in feare of the losse of his estate, by
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:14764:383"/>
the meanes of some unhappy casualtie; if now hee may escape that losse: hee will bestow a great deale on God, and on the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God; nay; hee promises, and vowes unto God in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie. But how many of those promises, as well as those other purposes, come to nothing? they have libertie, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive health; they enjoy safetie, and have the full fruition of all their desires: but alas, how short come their vowes of peformance? not one of many of them, but turnes God away without his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Remember how the Lord taxeth the people of Israel; <hi>In</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 78.</note> 
                     <hi>the day of their distresse</hi> (and the Lord reckons up divers and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie troubles they were in) then they spake good words to God: they would cleave to him, and promised to doe thus and thus. But (thus saith the Text) <hi>They flattered the Lord with their lippes,</hi> and were false in the Covenant with God. Is not it so (beloved) with many of us? Oh that your hearts might smite you this day, before the Lord, for many purposes, and promises that you have made of doing this or that, for the glorifying of God, and the discharge of your dutie! One man hath promised restitution of unjust gaine: another, to become more liberall, and bountifull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others. And the Lord hath waited weeke after weeke, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth after moneth, and yeare after yeare; and yet neverthelesse you continue the same men, either unsensible, or carelesse to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish your promise to God, or rendring unto him his due. That is the first Use.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let it stirre up every one of us to a care of his dutie of embracing opportunities. And when wee perswade you to <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> take opportunities, wee would draw you a degree higher: not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take them, but to seeke them; for how shall a man obtaine the advantage of taking opportunities, if he first seeke them not? and therefore we perswade you to that. Wee see <hi>Abraham sitting in the dore of his Tent,</hi> that hee might observe opportunities of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 19.</note> good; hee stayed not till the men knocked at his doore for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, but tooke notice of their passing by, that he might call them. Wee see a good old man in <hi>Iudges</hi> 19. As hee perceives a stranger passing the streetes, first takes occasion to question his wants, and forbeares not till the man complaine; so willing was hee to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister to his necessities, and to embrace a fit opportunitie of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him good. Wee see <hi>David</hi> expressing his thankfulnesse to God, and to <hi>Ionathan. Hee enquires if there were any of the house of Saul, that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> might shew him kindnesse for Ionathans sake.</hi> So should <note place="margin">2 Sam. 9. 1.</note> we doe. Is there any of <hi>the houshold of Faith</hi> (as the Text saith, and as the Scripture calls them) unto whom I may shew kindnesse for the Lords sake? Hee hath beene better to us then <hi>Ionathan</hi> was to <hi>David,</hi> and yet wee are much more backward to Retribution, and expressions of thankfulnesse then <hi>David</hi> was to <hi>Ionathan.</hi>
                     <pb n="777" facs="tcp:14764:383"/>
But the Scriptures are plentifull in this, wee need not stand on it; I say this is a dutie that every one should discharge this taske: not to stay and forbeare till the reports of mens wants are brought to them, but to bee circumspect and seeke for all occasions that may deserve the extent of their goodnesse. If you live in a Parish wherein (happily) there remaines not many poore, yet you live in a Citie, there are many there; if there bee not many in the Citie; you live in a Country, in a Kingdome, doubtles where there are many; if there bee none there, yet thou hast further meanes to extend thy charitie: Thou livest in a Church, is there any member of the Church in all the World dispersed in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> in any place of the earth where the poore abide? enquire after them, that you may know their wants, and relieve their necessities.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the second, from the determination of time, to the declaration of dutie, while wee have time.
<q>Let us doe good.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I told you what this goodnesse is, in the intent of the Apostle in this place. Doing good is a releeving those that are in necessity, for that is the Apostles meaning, as we may see in the context and coherence of these words with the former. So then the maine Point is no more but this;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is the dutie of Gods servants</hi> (as to make advantages of their times <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. It is the dutie of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve others.</note> so) <hi>to employ themselves in releeving of others.</hi> Take it more briefly. <hi>It is a doing good, to releive others,</hi> that is the dutie of Gods servants; and it well becomes them, to be employed in this work, while we have time on earth and meanes to doe it, to employ our selves in doing good, and releiving others. And there is familiar appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this in Scripture, and by reasons also.</p>
                  <p>By Scripture it is commanded in precept, and commended in practise of the Saints. <hi>If any of thy brethren among thee be poore</hi> (saith <note place="margin">Deut. 15. 7.</note> God) <hi>thou shalt not harden thy heart, thou shalt not shut up thy hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thy poore brother.</hi> The not opening the hands to relieve him, God accounts that as proceeding from the hardnesse of the heart. <hi>Thou shalt not harden thy heart against thy brother,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cast thy bread</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 11. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>upon the Waters, for after many dayes thou shalt finde it. Is not this the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 58. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>fast that I have chosen, for a man to give his bread to the hungry; and that a man should release those that are in Captivity, and to let the oppressed goe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>free?</hi> The Apostle wisheth that as they abounded in knowledge, and in vertue, and in faith, and goodnesse; so they might abound also in this Grace of God. The Grace of God that he there speaks of, is the willing readinesse to the doing of good. <hi>To doe good, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>to distribute forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</hi> You see there by doing good, he meanes distribution: the latter word doth prove the former, and both explaine this Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="778" facs="tcp:14764:384"/>
You have it likewise commended in the practice of the Saints. I need not bee large in discoursing to you the carriage of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Lot,</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Iob,</hi> the practice of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> yea of <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe. The Scripture is plentifull in this, I and that which is more to bee observed, that although Christ himselfe were relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by others, yet out of that hee gave a share to the poore.</p>
                  <p>It will appeare likewise in reason, that this is a necessarie dutie, <note place="margin">Iohn 15. 29.</note> and these may be taken.</p>
                  <p>First, from the equity of it; for it is equall you should thus <note place="margin">Reason 1.</note> employ your time and estate, and those advantages of life which God hath made you doner of, partly to that purpose; and a man commits an injurie in neglecting these holy duties: and is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become an unmercifull, but an unjust man, and so in the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest phrase a dishonest man: hee is not just that doth not thus. Therefore, <hi>with-hold not the good from the owner thereof,</hi> (sayth God) <note place="margin">Pro. 3. 26. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>when it is in thy power to give.</hi> The poore is owner of the estate of the rich so farre as his necessitie requires it; and it proves but a matter of justice and equitie, to bestow his riches where it ought to bee bestowed: and a man is unjust in that respect if hee doe it not. Riches are called <hi>unrighteous Mammon</hi> (as hath beene expressed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) when they are urighteously with-held from them to whom <note place="margin">Luke 16 9</note> they should bee given, as well as when they are unrighteously gotten. So that detaining it from those unto whom it is appointed by Gods direction, converts that riches (perchance honestly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured) into the Mammon of unrighteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as it becomes a matter of justice, so it proves like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <note place="margin">Reason. 2.</note> a matter of wisedome: a man makes wise provision for the present, and the future also by this course. And therefore it makes way for the felicitie of the servants of God, to employ their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in the execution of this dutie, and to lay fast hold on the forehead of opportunitie.</p>
                  <p>First, it proves a consequent of wisedome for themselves in procuring their owne good. <hi>Blessed is the man that judgeth wisely of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 41. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>the poore,</hi> why so? <hi>the Lord will consider him in the day of evill, and he will not give him over to the will of his enemies.</hi> What is the thing that a man is most subject to feare in this World? but that which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> sayth concerning <hi>Saul: I shall fall sometime or other by the hands of some enemie,</hi> of some mischievous person, or malicious person or other. You see the Lord hath here promis'd a large assurance of safetie and protection from the malice of his adversaries in the day of evill, if hee wisely consider the poore. Againe it makes much for the good of his posteritie. <hi>The good man is mercifull,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">Psal 37. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>and his feed inherits the blessing.</hi> It may bee he perceives not such sensible and apparant fruits, or outward successe in his owne life upon this course, yet his seed inherits the blessing: and the lesse
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:14764:384"/>
hee enjoyes, the more shall they receive of Gods goodnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, as a recompence for his benevolent kindnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the people of God. And what greater legacie can man bestow upon his posteritie then to leave them (by his particular meanes) in the loving favour of the Almightie.</p>
                  <p>And as it is so for the present, so it becomes a course of wisdome for the future also. <hi>Charge the rich men of the World that they be ready to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>doe good,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>laying up a good foundation for the time to come.</hi> And by this meanes a man may provide well for eternitie. <hi>Make you friends</hi> (sayth Christ) <hi>of your unrighteous Mammon, that when you faile, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</hi> The way for a man to provide for eternall good, is to use his tallent of wealth and estate (for the present) to the good of many. Thus wee see the Reasons plainly verified: To make use of it briefly and hasten to that which remaines</p>
                  <p>Is it so then, that it is writ downe to bee the dutie of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <note place="margin">Vse.</note> to mannage the opportunities of this life for this end, and in this course of doing good; that is, of distribution and reliefe.</p>
                  <p>Then it serves to reprove those that neglect this dutie, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <note place="margin">1.</note> it not a businesse of their life; onely they conceive of it as a matter of praise and commendations, a thing that they doe well in performing, and not very ill in omitting. They conceive it to bee of no absolvte necessitie, but voluntary charitie, as a matter arbitrarie, but not as a dutie necessarie, and for this cause they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare but slack and indifferent: they conceive this as a dutie to lay up wealth, but never remember the necessity of laying out wealth to bee commanded for a greater dutie then the former: they take it for their dutie to get all they can, but forget the following pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, to doe all the good with that they get, as they can. And here is the reason why there are such lavish expences bestowed upon every vanitie, that the portion of the poore, and such as ought to bee relieved with our estates in point of equitie; and by vertue of Gods Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement is swallowed up by every vanity. It is spent in excessiue apparell, for the satisfaction of the vaine fashion-monger: in superfluity of dyet for the Glutton, and the Epicure: in Haukes, and Hounds, and Dogs, to please the humour of the voluptuous person: it is consumed in raising up vaine and unnecessarie Buildings by earth-wormes, that make their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions below, and lay a foundation for themselves on earth; neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting that goodly building given of God, to the re-edifying of their soules in the kingdome of Grace. And thus is the portion of the poore consumed, and themselves (for want of the same) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to all the miserie that this World can inflict. Some cry they cannot doe it, wee have not an estate to undergoe it; in the meane time they runne to excesse of Riot, and make such volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="780" facs="tcp:14764:385"/>
and superfluous feasts, that the <hi>Phenix</hi> hardly escapes the bounds of their desires. If you can bee thus excessive in your dyet, in your apparell, in your sports; if you can cast away in presents, and in gifts, in bribes, and in gratuities, superfluously upon rich friends: there must (of necessitie) bee a defect in your will to the command of God, when you neglect the miserable condition of the poore, and lend no hand to helpe them. What is the reason of it? but because of the naturall rebellion and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thisme that is in the heart of every man against God; that they will employ their estates any way, rather then bestow them to that purpose for which they are appointed by God. Oh what account shall such bee able to make at the day of Judgement; doe but suppose <hi>when the Bookes shall</hi> come <hi>to bee opened,</hi> wherein the particular <hi>diaries</hi> and passages of your life shall be thus examined: <hi>Item,</hi> so much for a feast; <hi>Item,</hi> on such a day, for such another great feast; and many a hundred daies, for as many hundred feasts, wherein hundreds of the servants of God have endured extreame want, and inforced into banishment into other places, to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, to miserie and distresse, when thou couldst not finde one of them in a corner of thy purse. <hi>Item,</hi> so much for such apparell, for such entertainment, for such building of Walks and Galleries; What nothing for the servants of God? are they so emptie, when your houses appeare so full? live they so poore, and you so rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clad? what can you spare nothing for Christ, and the distressed members of the Church all this while? Oh my beloved, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what <hi>Iames</hi> sayth; <hi>Goe to now you rich men, weepe and houle, for</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Let it teach therfore the servants of God to bestow their Almes <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> most willingly, to be free and in continuall readinesse, in extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their contribution towards the necessities of those that want them; and not onely so, but to doe good in so doing, for that is the principall dutie unto which the Text doth invite you. <hi>While you have opportunitie, do good.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how shall a man in such actions of mercie, and bountie, and liberalitie, make it appeare <hi>that hee doth good?</hi> Therefore briefly, <note place="margin">How to give so as to doe good. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1 Give justly.</note> take some helpes in this.</p>
                  <p>A man that will contribute out of his estate to releeve others, and intends to doe good. First, hee must doe what hee doth just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he must not out of mercie extended to one, injure another, but must alwayes levell his charitie by his owne abilitie. And this is that which the holy Ghost calls, the giving of a mans owne. <hi>Cast [thy] bread upon the waters: thy</hi> owne bread, not another <note place="margin">Eccles. 11. 1.</note> mans. To give that which is a mans owne by right, by lawfull
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:14764:385"/>
procuring; his owne by right of possession, the gifts bestowed out of that, makes acceptation before God, and provides a double recompence for the giver. You see how <hi>Zacheus</hi> gives; <hi>If I have wronged any man, I will restore it, and halfe my goods I give to the poore.</hi> That is, I will first make restitution of what I have unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gotten, and then of the remainder, I will give halfe to the poore.</p>
                  <p>It is no giving for a man, to employ all his life-time in the procurement of unjust gaine: By Usurie, deceit in trading, and other indirect and forbidden courses, to heape up abundance of <hi>red clay;</hi> and then to summe up a large Bill of the particular good hee intends to Religion; for Churches, and for Hospitalls, and the poore, with other such like benevolences, makes but a simple satisfaction for thy unjuct courses, in procuring such wealth to the prejudice, and detriment of others: this is nothing to thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; all this while thou art a theefe, and givest stolne goods. Nay; thou maist further assure thy selfe, that Hell shall bee the greatest recompence of thy charitie, because thou bestowest that which is not thine. Thou oughtest first to have made thy estate cleare, and have restored the things that belonged unto others, and reserved thine owne by it selfe, and then to give free scope to thy charitie to the doing of any good action, which time and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion could propound. This is the first dutie of any man that will doe good in giving, he must give justly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee must give wisely too, it is made the marke of a <note place="margin">2. Give wisely. Psal. 1 12.</note> man fearing God; <hi>Hee considers wisely of the poore, and hee orders his affaires with judgement.</hi> What is that? Judgement hath a twofold respect; it hath respect to the quantitie of a mans gift; and to the qualitie of the person to whom he gives.</p>
                  <p>There must be a judgement, a wise ordering of things in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <note place="margin">In respect of the quantitie.</note> of the quantitie which a man bestowes, according to that expression of the holy Ghost in <hi>Acts 11. 29. They gave according to their abilities,</hi> they kept within the limits of their estates, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not. So must thou, or else another man may (perchance) lose by thy liberalitie.</p>
                  <p>Againe, there must be respect had to the qualitie of the person <note place="margin">In respect of the qualitie.</note> to whom hee gives; <hi>My goodnesse extends to the Saints that are on earth, to the faithful ones;</hi> as the Text saith here, <hi>to the houshold of faith.</hi> It is not necessarie to give to every one that comes next to hand. There be some persons, I told you before, that are not to be relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, except in case of extreme necessitie. Wee must extend our Benevolence to those of the houshold of Faith. Give unto Christ, and to the naked and hungrie members, that belong unto him, and thou shalt not want a sweet and comfortable returne of thy charitie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="782" facs="tcp:14764:386"/>
Againe, as it must be done justly and wisely, so (if we desire to do <note place="margin">3. Give in sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie. Rom. 12. 8.</note> good in releeving) wee must doe it simply. In the simplicitie and plainnesse of our hearts; <hi>Let him that distributes, doe it in simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> saith the Apostle. What is that simplicitie? when a man lookes up to God with a single eye (as the eye may be said to bee single when it viewes but one object at once so) the heart is small when it respects God onely in this action of charitie, and makes no other reckoning of any outward object. A double-minded man he lookes up to God, and yet carries some respect to the outward honour which hee expects of the World; and more (often times) to the World then to God, at least he joynes them together. But if a man bee desirous to bestow his benevolence with a purpose to receive recompence from above, let him doe it for his sake that commands it, and reflect upon God in all things. <hi>This is the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of our Conscience</hi> (sayth the Apostle) <hi>that in simplicitie and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie wee have had our conversation among you:</hi> not affecting the praise of men, but ayming <hi>to approve our selves to God</hi> in that wee doe. This is that which Christ advised the Pharisees, that they should not admit <hi>their right hand to know what their left hand did.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, as it must be simple, so it must be chearefull: <hi>God loves</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. Give cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. 2 Cor. 8. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>a chearefull giver.</hi> And this is a perfect signe of chearfulnesse, when a man doth not only give without grudging, upon all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities: but when he will be carefull to prevent them in his willingnesse to seeke them. As I said before. So much for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point, the dutie it selfe.</p>
                  <p>Now I proceed to the last thing; that is, the description of the <note place="margin">The persons to whom good must be done.</note> persons to whom this must be done. First generally: <hi>All,</hi> and then particularly, <hi>The houshold of faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First generally: <hi>Doe good to all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is as I have told you, to all that endure such wants and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, <note place="margin">1. Generally to all.</note> as that it may be a worke of mercy, and no transgression of the rule to releeve them: for those that live unprofitably, and become burthens to the Common-wealth (except in case of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme necessitie) it loses the name of mercy to releeve them, and deserves neither reward nor commendations. Yet, if they live in extreme necessitie, then take the Rule of the Apostle; <hi>Doe good to all,</hi> even to them also. Wee have the Parable of our Saviour to direct us in this path where the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> lends his assistance <note place="margin">Luke 10.</note> to the <hi>Iew</hi> that fell among theeves: Wee cannot but know of the opposition and enmitie, betweene the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and the <hi>Iewes:</hi> yet wee see that in case of extremitie, the <hi>Samaritan</hi> helpes the <hi>Iew.</hi> Therein our Saviour teacheth us, that every man (in this case) is a mans neighbour, and therefore the same law that commands <hi>to love thy neighbour as thy selfe;</hi> intends wee should doe good to all, if necessitie require.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="783" facs="tcp:14764:386"/>
The Reason is, in regard there is the same maker of one, as of another; <hi>Wee have all one Father</hi> (sayth the Prophet) and <hi>hath not one God created us?</hi> Then by Creation wee are all alike Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though not by Adoption, and especiall Grace: and as they <note place="margin">Mala. 2. 10.</note> are the Creatures of God and beare the Image of their Maker; there ought to bee some consideration extended toward them, in case of extreame necessitie.</p>
                  <p>Againe, there dwells a part of Gods Image in all man kinde, <note place="margin">Reason 2.</note> and that resemblance makes us alied to each other by the bonds of Nature: then <hi>if wee love not our brother whom wee see daylie, how shall</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Iohn 4. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>wee love him whom wee never saw?</hi> sayth the Apostle.</p>
                  <p>To make some use briefly of this. Is it so, that doing of good <note place="margin">Vse.</note> is to bee extended to all when necessitie requires it: Then let it teach us (without all evasion and protraction of those duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded) to embrace every object and occasion that may invite us to doe good, and to bee mercifull.</p>
                  <p>But some man may reply in this fashion, my intent is very ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: that way of goodnesse, I could willingly extend it toward <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> such a man; but hee is a stranger unto mee, and one with whom I was never acquainted.</p>
                  <p>What is this, but the churlish reply of <hi>Nabal</hi> to the servants of <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                     <hi>David?</hi> there are divers men abroad whom I know not; <hi>there are</hi> some <hi>servants that are runne from their masters, shall I give my bread</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>and that I have provided for my shearers</hi> unto them? <hi>Nabal was his name, and follie was with him. Abigal</hi> did truly interpret his nature to bee answerable to his name, which signified a man of follie; for if his conditions had beene otherwise, he would not have sent them emptie to their Master, knowing their absolute necessitie, in which case a stranger ought to bee relieved, and we cannot thrust him backe from our charitie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, such a one (I confesse) is not a stranger, but an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie; and when it lay in his power, hee procur'd mee all the <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> mischiefe hee could, and should I now relieve him?</p>
                  <p>Marke the rule of the Apostle; <hi>If thine enemie hunger, feed him;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                     <hi>if hee bee naked, cloath him; if he thirst, give him drinke: for in so doing thou shalt heap coales of fire upon his head.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But some man will say, there remaines so much unthankfulnes <note place="margin">Object.</note> in the World, that one is soone discouraged (by peoples ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude) in the office of doing good.</p>
                  <p>But what saith the Lord, <hi>Cast thy bread upon the waters, for after</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                     <hi>many dayes thou shalt finde it.</hi> Thought it seeme no more to thee but <note place="margin">Eccles. 11. 1.</note> as a stone suncke downe into the deepe, or as a morsell of bread in the water, that floates from the sight of him that cast it in, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out possibilitie of recovering it againe, or receiving any fruit or benefit from the same; yet cease not to cast it there, <hi>for after many dayes thou shalt finde it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="784" facs="tcp:14764:387"/>
But some man replies, I doe good to some already; I give some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">Objection.</note> to the maintaining of a Scholler in the Universitie; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what I doe for the binding of a poore Child to an Apprentishippe, and I have bestowed my good will towards the setting up of a young beginner in his trade, what is there no end of doing good?</p>
                  <p>Marke again, the advise of <hi>Solomon</hi> for that; <hi>Give a portion to seven,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                     <hi>and to eight.</hi> If thou have done good to one, extend it to a second, to a third, and againe to a fourth, and a fift, and sixt, and a seventh, and to eight, and so long as there remaines an object of mercie, and power in thine hands to doe it, though thou hast extended the like bountie to seven, and to eight already.</p>
                  <p>Some man will answer againe, that by this course (if every man bestow his benevolence so largely) no man could become <note place="margin">Obiection</note> rich in this life; and God appoints some rich men in this World as well as poore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> answers that objection thus. <hi>If the Clouds bee full they poure downe raine.</hi> As if hee should have argued thus. God hath <note place="margin">Answer.</note> bestowed riches on men, as hee hath given raine to the Clouds, hee gave them that superfluitie of waters to poure downe on the earth for the benefit of the same; and not that they shall still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it to no purpose at all: So God hath given riches to men, that when they arive at a fulnesse of estate, they should then poure downe and distill the fruits of that blessing on them that are poore and live in necessitie, as the raine descends upon drie clods of earth.</p>
                  <p>But some man will say, a man might poure downe comfort, <note place="margin">Obiection</note> but the ill successe it meets with, and the little good it begets in them on whom it is bestowed (for they oftentimes become worse, by the receipt of such benefits,) disheartens the giver from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending of his charitie according to Gods command, and his owne good nature.</p>
                  <p>Saith <hi>Solomon</hi> for that; <hi>As the Tree falls so it lyes, whether to the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Answer.</note> 
                     <hi>East, or West, to North, or South,</hi> his meaning is this. As the Tree being hewen downe (lie which way it will) falls to the profit and advantage of the owner: so it proves with all things thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formest with intent to please God, and glorifie him, though they fall more prosperous, or lesse prosperous in the event; yet the conclusion converts them all to the glorie of God, his pleasure, and the advantage of the owner; and there they lye, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence also.</p>
                  <p>But some man may say, I have continued a great while in the <note place="margin">Obiection.</note> exercise of doing of good; I am now old, and have lived thus long at my trade, and thus long I have beene a House-keeper, and thus long have had an estate in my hands; all which time I have ever employed my selfe in the performance of good offices
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:14764:387"/>
for others, and did not intermit any occasion that might invite me to the doing of good. And is it not yet time to cease?</p>
                  <p>No (saith <hi>Solomon) in the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                     <hi>let not thy hand rest.</hi> (For all those words are but severall answers, to severall objections;) So we thy seed in the morning of thy life, when thy estate begins to be improved, and then even in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thy life, when thou hast left off gaining, cease not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in giving.</p>
                  <p>Saith another man; You must not loppe the twigge too soone, <note place="margin">Obiection.</note> that is but beginning to grow. I am but how in the way to thrive, and when I am further entred into that course, I will not faile to extend my goodnesse to others.</p>
                  <p>So we thy seed in the morning of thy life. <note place="margin">Answ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But saith another man, I have done that already, and now it <note place="margin">Obiection.</note> ceaseth to be with me as before, by reason I follow not my trade, and have no more possibilitie of getting.</p>
                  <p>But let not thy hand cease in the evening, saith God. When thy <note place="margin">Answ.</note> shop windowes are shut up, thy compassion must still continue open, when thou hast bid gaine adue, and taken thy leave of all the wayes of getting: even then, if thou enjoy an estate in thine hands, and abilitie to doe good, there is no excuse for thee to cease from bestowing it, though it be in the evening. Thus wee see there is no time excepted, nor person to be refused, if necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie require; but a man must doe good to all men at all times. So much for that.</p>
                  <p>But the matter chiefly intended is these two;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That there are some poore of the houshold of faith.</hi> That is the first. <note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> God hath (in the houshold of faith) some that stand in need of reliefe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that <hi>all that are in the houshold should especially looke</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>unto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First (I say) <hi>there are some of the houshold of faith: true beleevers</hi>

                        </gap>;</hi> they were Saints, and yet poore; receiving helpe <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 26.</note> from a company of poore people at <hi>Macedonia,</hi> being so poore, that the Apostle beares witnesse of them, <hi>they gave above their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</hi> We see a poore man, and yet an heire of heaven, lying full <note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> of sores, and in want, at the gate of <hi>Dives,</hi> that was after throwne into hell: An heire of heaven, and yet on earth a Beggar.</p>
                  <p>You see then (beloved) the point is true: now wee will descend, and see how it appeares to be so, and for what respect it comes to passe, by Gods providence.</p>
                  <p>First, it becomes so, that there may be a conformitie betweene <note place="margin">Reason 1.</note> the head and the members; for <hi>Christ that was rich, for our sakes became poore,</hi> saith the Scripture; even Christ that was rich, and Lord over all, became poore, and <hi>in the forme of a servant</hi> unto all, <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> Cor. 8. 9.</note> for our sakes; so poore that wee see, <hi>the foxes had holes, and the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>fowles of the ayre had nests;</hi> but our Redeemer had no shelter, no not so much roome, as <hi>to rest his head.</hi> Now there must bee a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie betweene Christ and his members: if the head be poore, necessitie makes the other members partake of the same Cuppe.</p>
                  <p>Againe secondly, if you observe and looke on the condition <note place="margin">Reason 2.</note> of Gods Saints of <hi>the houshold of faith</hi> on earth here, you shall find small occasion to marvell at their simple estates, considering they are a company of travellers and Pilgrims in this world; <hi>I beseech</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>you, as Pilgrims and strangers,</hi> &amp;c. They are not only strangers, which may have riches convaide unto them, after some certaine stay in a place. But they are Pilgrims, and time will not permit their abode in one place, upon any condition of advantage; for their profession compells them from one place to another: On whom our Proverbe may truly be verified; that <hi>a rouling stone ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers nothing.</hi> They are Pilgrims, and Pilgrims desires extend no further (in this life) then a staffe and a scrippe; <hi>This is the brood of travellers</hi> (saith <hi>David) that seeke thy face.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there followes another reason, and that proceedes from the opposition they find in the world against their course; <note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> the world labours to make them poore, and having prevailed (like an imperious Jaylour, to a distressed prisoner) endevours to keepe them under. And it comes so to passe, in regard of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall enmitie, and division that is in the world, in opposition of the wayes of God: You shall find that our Saviour intending to goe to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> made his way through <hi>Samaria,</hi> and dispatched <note place="margin">Luk 9. 53.</note> some before to provide him lodging. But the <hi>Samaritans</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, or suspecting that he was minded to goe thither, refused to entertaine him. <hi>They would not receive him,</hi> saith the Text;
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:14764:388"/>
Why? Because he was going unto <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Beloved, thus deales the world with the members of Christ: if they would relie on the world, and make that their end, as they doe, then riches should flow in in abundance, and their estates might arive to be as eminent and mightie as others. But if their mindes be resolved for <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> and their eyes reflect that way; Let them seeke their owne entertainment; for they shall receive no benefit, nor enjoy any contentment, by their permission.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, God disposeth it to be so by his wondrous providence, <note place="margin">Reason 4.</note> that his glory may be so much the more conspicuous and open; in providing that they <hi>of the houshold of faith</hi> should endure the scourge of povertie on earth, that so the worke of his grace may appeare the more in them, by the meanes of their povertie; for when doth grace make it selfe more manifest in the heart, then in the middest of such extremities? The starres make the brightest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, in the obscurest night: and grace appeares most glorious, chiefly in distresse; <hi>You have heard of the patience of Iob;</hi> had not <note place="margin">Jam. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Iob</hi> endured much sorrow, and beene exercised in many afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the world had beene ignorant of his vertues: hee was first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his substance, and suffered the torments of his body, before hee expressed his patience. You have heard of the faith of those people, <hi>which wandered in sheepes-skinnes, and goats-skins.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> But how could you have beene acquainted with their faith; if you had not heard of their clothing? you see them in sheepes-skinnes, and goats-skinnes, enduring contempt of the world, to preserve faith and a good conscience; and so you became acquainted with their faith also.</p>
                  <p>Is it so then, that Gods servants are thus, then let the world <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> wonder their fill at it, and let not us <hi>account it a strange thing,</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Iames)</hi> for it befalls others of the Saints. So say I, when wee see of <hi>the houshold of faith</hi> in povertie, account it no strange matter, that God bestowes not riches in this world, to one that is rich in grace. You see a multitude of beleevers stript of all they <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> had, and yet they were holy and religious.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, condemne not their wayes, for the entertainment <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> they meet with in the world. Like not the worse of the wayes of God, because he afflicts his servants; you should then <hi>judge evill of the generation of the just.</hi> You know <hi>Iob</hi> was a man beloved of God: from heaven he witnesseth his goodnesse; <hi>Hee was an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job 1.</note> 
                     <hi>and a just man, one that feared God, and eschewed evill.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding you see how hee was environed with troubles, and made destitute of meanes, and the societie of his friends, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that his three familiar acquaintance did conclude, that therefore hee was an hypocrite, and that God had found him out in some sinne. But the ensuing displeasure of God towards these
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:14764:389"/>
men (though it tooke no effect because of the righteous invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his servant <hi>Iob)</hi> will tell us there belongs a judgement to those that censure the Children of God by their afflictions, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their sinnes and their sufferings both in one scale together. But beware of incurring Gods displeasure, by accusing the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the just, in respect of their unprosperous events in this World. Thou seest one man disgraced, in much trouble, it may bee in extreame necessitie for want of these outward blessings; presently thou concludest something is amisse in his life. Thou perceivest another growes rich, having riches, and honour, and applause in the World, notwithstanding hee goes on in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane course; yet thou concludest certainly God loves this man: these are dangerous conclusions: <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> were beloved of God, if this bee a signe of love, now God himselfe sayd that <hi>Hee hated Esau. Esau</hi> whom God hated, had twelve Dukes to his Sonnes, enjoying abundance and superfluitie of all things: and therefore forbea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e to reprove the just man, or call his integritie into question, because of his outward poverty.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, take heed you despise not <hi>the Houshold of Faith</hi> for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward povertie; thinke not meanly of them, nor the worse of <note place="margin">Vse. 5.</note> Grace, because of their simple outside; for this is to <hi>have the Faith of God in respect of mens persons: when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> man comes in gay cloathing,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">James 2.</note> 
                     <hi>you say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sit here in a goodly place; but a man in meaner apparell, stand thou there,</hi> &amp;c. the meaning is this. The Apostle stands not so much upon the placing of men, but rather inveighs against the unseemly disposition of mens hearts, that slighted Grace in the poore members of the bodie, because they were not adorned with those outward ornaments that beautifie the bodie. This thing the Lord calls a despising of the poore; <hi>yee have despised the poore:</hi> so that they did not walke as beleevers, nor honour God in sinceritie, because instead of honouring God by a familiar societie with the faithfull, they despised him in contemning his Graces for their outward povertie unto whom hee had bestowed them: not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to a phantasticall offender, whose pardon being seal'd and sent him by an unworthie person, chose rather to die for his offence, then accept of his pardon from the hands of an inferiour person.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the last Point is this, that <hi>These servants of God, of the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. The hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of faith especially to to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Psal. 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>Houshold of Faith being poore, should especially bee look't unto by those of the same house that are rich:</hi> above all other persons they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect those of the Houshold of Faith. So <hi>David, My goodnesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth not to thee, but to the Saints on earth.</hi> The Apostle witnesseth of <hi>Philemon, That hee had refreshed the bowells of the Saints,</hi> and had done good to them, taking most especiall notice of him, because of his goodnesse extended towards them. This is the dutie.</p>
                  <p>And the Reason of it is, because that for this intent hath God <note place="margin">Reason.</note>
                     <pb n="789" facs="tcp:14764:389"/>
given riches unto some that have grace, that so they might espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially administer the comfort that wealth brings with it, unto those that are poore of the same Houshold and profession of grace: I say, for this very reason God hath furnished some of his Elect with wealth and opportunities; that above all other they might reserve a diligent care and respect towards others that share with them in the same Grace; if they doe not, I am certaine the world will not; for of all other people, those that feare God are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to whom they wish most unhappinesse, and shortest conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of life in this World. Therefore hath God given wealth to those that have Grace, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>y might minister a seasonable reliefe to others; whose wants doe call for it. <hi>Let the brother of low degree rejoyce in that hee is exalted; and let the brother of high degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in that hee is made low:</hi> what is the low bringing of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in high degree, but that hee becomes servant to him of low degree; his wealth and revenewes, nay all that hee enjoyes, hee confesseth to bee for the service of the poorest Christian. Then hath the brother of low degree occasion enough to rejoyce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the brother of high degree receives both exaltation, wealth, and preferment, and all that hee possesseth for his good. And therefore beloved, doe not slightly passe by this necessarie dutie, for it will require your serious consideration, and your best ability to performe it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>The life of our deceased Sister, was but a commentarie upon this Text; Shee hath beene (amongst those that knew her, in her life) a lively patterne, and example, of the performance of every dutie; that we have now spoken of.

                  <p>After, it pleased God when she came to <hi>England,</hi> to reveale to her, <hi>the way of salvation more fully</hi> then she knew before, to make her understand more clearely of the power of godlinesse, and what the practice of Christianitie meant, which she before had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived only in the Theorie, in formes of doctrines, but not so heartily, and seriously looking into them.

                  </p>
                  <p>Those opportunities she embraced in health (by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and goodnesse of God) were managed by her, with such care and respect, that successe followed their conclusions with much advantage. Shee increased in love (that radicall grace) as the sap doth increase in the root, extending that love to Christ and to the servants of God: ever delighting in their company; prizing them at a high rate, as the onely excellent ones, and some very poore and weake Christians; naming them according to the phrase of our Saviour <hi>worthy persons:</hi> and such a one was a worthy man, or a worthy woman, being the termes wherewith shee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed her honourable esteeme of those that feared the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Besides, in the whole course of her life shee exercised the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I have seen notes of her own gathering out of the Scripture: wherein it seemed shee desired to become a profitable reader, in making use of such particular places as struck against such corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which shee was more especially desirous to take notice of: and such directions to duties, and incouragements by promise were likewise inserted therein, that (I am perswaded) I cannot doe better then to commend this duty to the practice of all the servants of God, that when they come to peruse the Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Shee was a hearty hater of sinne, and of all evill, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance thereof, being carefull to doe good so farre as shee was convinced in any thing to her revealed, and willing to receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, and to be informed in those things that were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. Those that knew her may well witnesse with me that shee never neglected the smallest occasion conducing to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her soule in the wayes of goodnesse.</p>
                  <p>But for the second, the maine intent of this Text, and the reason for which I tooke it, in this particular dutie, I may resolve you, as it is said of the vertuous woman (and may speake truly, in the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of an honest heart) <hi>Many daughters have done excellently, but thou surmountest them all.</hi> I never knew any woman in my life more <note place="margin">Prov. 311</note> active and readie to doe the workes of charitie: according as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie and her abilitie made way for the same. Not onely of her owne, wherein she tooke her Husbands consent with her; But where shee prov'd unable of her selfe to supply the necessities of others: her labours and indevours to incite, and stirre up others, made full satisfaction in the roome of her benevolence, and she became an industrious Christian in that kind. That I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="794" facs="tcp:14764:392"/>
herein shee was ever large and boundlesse: <hi>sowing her seed in the morning, and her hands ceased not in the evening: shee gave a portion to seaven, and also to eight:</hi> and as any came in her way that were in extreame necessitie, shee became a present helper of every of them, according to their severall necessities.</p>
                  <p>Shee was very tender hearted, and that which she bestowed to relieve others; was done in compassion of heart towards those that endured miserie. But as shee saw any <hi>of the Houshold of Faith,</hi> and the servants of God which shee tooke notice of by some infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libile signe: shee did not onely relieve them with her Purse, but receive them into her heart, which was still open and enlarged to give them entertainment. She was not straightned in her bowels towards them, but was large hearted, and large handed, full of Almes, when that might helpe; and when it could not, shee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked others to exercise the like charitie. Besides, she had other wayes to succour them, in speaking for them, and stirring up o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to speake for them, when words might availe them and doe them good; relieving them with money, and provoking others thereunto, when such contributions were needfull; and therein shee would not let slippe the least opportunitie, but would take the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>dvantage of great and solemne meetings; seasoning those fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> which she frequented with some acts of mercie before they parted, that the company and societie she conversed with, might savour of this sweetnesse of mercie as a precious oyntment, and become good examples unto others; and improve the gifts and abilities which God had given them to the same purpose.</p>
                  <p>Shee was not onely mindfull of those at home, but <hi>her good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse extended to the Saints</hi> abroad. And not in respect of Nature onely, because they were come into the Countrey where shee was borne, (I speake now of those that live in distresse and exile, of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and <hi>Germany,)</hi> but in respect of Grace. Shee was wondrous industrious and laborious, to procure all the meanes that might bee to send over to helpe them, and even <hi>refreshed the bowells of the Saints;</hi> that I may truly say <hi>the loynes of the poore</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God for her in many places. In what place hath shee lived, and hath not left a savour behinde her? nay, (almost) in what company hath shee conversed, but this particular dutie hath been as a precious oyntment to sweeten the conversations of all that were about her; and to worke in their mindes a vertuous intention and propensenesse to this dutie? Beloved, here you have her in her carriage and example.</p>
                  <p>What shee was in her behaviour towards her Husband, and her Children I need not speake, there are enough can witnesse it; shee carried her selfe as became<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wife to him, and a helper of the servants of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>od with prayers and desires, and often provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="795" facs="tcp:14764:392"/>
and incitings that way. But for her Children, shee seem'd to undergoe a second travaile with them, <hi>till Christ were formed in them;</hi> being full of earnest desires and petitions for the working of Grace where it was not begun, and for the perfecting thereof, where it was newly entred. Shee rejoyced exceedingly in any expression of good, and more for that of Grace then any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination or respect.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, this was obvious and common to all, and any man might take speciall notice thereof dayly, and observe it constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In her servants, as there appeared the mere grace in any; so much the more respect she extended towards them. In the poore as shee perceived the more grace in any; the more reliefe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from her, &amp;c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> say nothing what (in all this) shee suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; those that were acquainted with her disease, know what paines shee under-went in respect of her bodie, and with what pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience shee submitted to the hand of God in all things; And many know the wrong shee endured from the World, for her desire and care to doe good when she obtain'd opportunitie. Some thought her over-bold, some to busie; others thought her proud and vaineglorious, because of her often frequenting of company, and speaking openly, for the provoking of others to the exercise of goodnesse. The Lord smite their hearts that are guilty of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging: that which wee are to suppose in respect of her forward disposition is this. Shee was naturally of a free spirit, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sanctified with Grace, and sharpned with love and zeale for the glory of God; made her the more resolute and familiar in frequenting good company; not to magnifie her selfe by their societie, but that her continuall conversation with them, might give her the better occasion to incite and stirre them to goodnesse. Let those that are guiltie of misprision, leave to censure her Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and convert them into an example for themselves to walke in: if they doe not, the neglect will loade their soules with more woe for such contempt, then shee hath received joy for her labour.</p>
                  <p>What concern'd her in her sicknesse briefly I have not much to say; in that they which were about her dayly, know more then I can relate: Shee did not onely expresse a satisfaction and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of heart, that her reconciliation was made with God in Christ: but besides that a willingnesse and desire to bee dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, (for that reason) <hi>that shee might hee with Christ.</hi> A Minister that was with her, asking how shee that had a Husband and Children, enjoying an estate and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> other comforts, could be willing to forgoe so many blessings, and exchange them all for death? She from that inward sence and perswasion of Gods love to her in Christ, concluded; my Husband is deare, and my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="796" facs="tcp:14764:393"/>
are deare to me, but Christ is dearer. Therefore I am willing to forgoe Husband and Children, and all the contents you can number in this life, that I might live with Christ, to partake of greater felicitie then this world can afford me.</p>
                  <p>And now the Lord Jesus hath received her into his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and satisfied her expectation with the performance of his love.</p>
                  <p>But wherefore have wee spoken all this? what, that wee might adde any praise unto the dead? no: But to quicken those that are living, and incite them to the like dutie. Some may thinke it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible there should be such activenesse in doing of good; and such unweariednesse in performing of the acts of mercy, and where (say they) shall we find such an example? you have it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes; and know that examples will rise in judgement against you, and condemne you, as well as precepts: If you follow them not, while they invite you. The Text saith; <hi>Doe good to all: especially to the houshold of faith.</hi> And here is an example before our eyes, of one who tooke her time, and <hi>opportunitie to doe good to all, especially to them of the houshold of Faith. Goe thou, and doe likewise.</hi>

Though goodnesse deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from Hell, yet it privildgeth not from temptations, or crosses; yea, the more eminent Holinesse is, many times the more it is exposed to sharpe and manifold assaults.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iob</hi> is set upon on all sides, he found the Divell a sore enemie, and his great estate a suddaine shipwrack; his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in a moment crusht to peeces. Hee had but three Points of Land to looke at in this troublesome sea, and every one of them seemed rather to augment, then to lessen the storme. His Wife, whose breath should have sweetned and eased his griefe, was an impatient vexation. His friends, whose counsells and compassions should have beene an easie har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and tender reliefe, they became his bitter and censorious judges. Yea, his God, who by his owne testimonie hee served, and feared with singular uprightnesse; and whose bowells are
<pb n="800" facs="tcp:14764:395"/>
ever tender and compassionate to such, and upon whose gracious acceptance hee thought to quiet and anchor his troubled spirit; yet anon he seemed not onely a stranger, but an enemie; and this went deepe, that even Mercie it selfe seemed cruell, and Kindnes so unkinde and harsh.</p>
                  <p>But what was his behaviour under all these? For the generall sweet and heavenly; For some particulars, sad and weak; when faith did worke hee was above all his stormes. In the deepest ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie, faith can settle and compose the soule, and fill it with the sweetest comforts. When sense and nature did worke, then hee was much impatient, and the winde had the better over him: In the one hee shewes himselfe a Christian, In the other a man: In the one <hi>Iob</hi> is beyond himselfe, in the other below himselfe; According to the time and manner of these severall workings, he is like or unlike himselfe. Thus it is with the best, whose outward change doth not more vary; but their inward carriage doth as much change. At length <hi>Iob</hi> after many disputes with his friends, and conflicts with himselfe, concenterates his thoughts in two maine Points.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 Another was to prepare for death; all the dayes of my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time I will waite till my change come, and there hee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth of his bodie. Many arguments hee layeth downe in this Chapter which did occasion him to these thoughts and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>The first is the brevitie of mans life: Verse 1. 2. <hi>Man th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>t is borne of a Woman is of few dayes, hee commeth forth like a Flower, and is cut downe; hee fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not;</hi> He sayth not yeeres, nor moneths, nor weekes, but dayes, and these dayes not many but few, and these few dayes not long, but short, as quickly set as the shadow, as quickly cropt as the flower.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the misery of that short life, in the same place, <hi>and full of trouble;</hi> as if every Article of life were replenished with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, even as every veine of the body is with bloud: this is own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience could tell him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the certaintie of Death. The Sunne hath his appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted race, which in the Winter is short, in the Summer long, but in both it hath a certaine time of setting; so the race of mans life, to some it may be shorter, to some longer, but the night will come, and all must be closed up in Death, <hi>verse 5. His dayes are determined, the number of them, they are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:14764:395"/>
which hee cannot passe;</hi> and if so, then high time for <hi>Iob</hi> to thinke of it, and prepare for it.</p>
                  <p>Death began in a manner to seize on him already in severall parts; in his feet, for his wealth was gone; in his loynes, having lost his children; in his heart, his friends leaving him; in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, for his wife was a discomforter; nay, in his very life it selfe, so much as was wrapt up in the outward part of his body, for that was diseased; in his speech and spirits, they grew hoarse and faint, all these were the harbingers of a future dissolution. Well therefore might <hi>Iob</hi> conclude, ever I must not live, and long I cannot live; therefore though in much miserie, and in bad dayes, I will thinke of Death, and fit my selfe for a good end, and apply my selfe seriously, and wisely for a good worke; <hi>All the dayes of my appointed time will I waite till my change come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which words containe in them two parts.</p>
                  <p>First, his future dissolution, which hee calls a <hi>change,</hi> and a <note place="margin">Parts of the Text.</note> change that is comming upon him, as if hee had beene the next man, <hi>till my change come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, his present disposition, <hi>I will waite,</hi> hee thinkes of death, before death, and prepares to die, while yet he lives. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was this a death-pang, a fitte, a humour which began quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and expired suddenly. Nay, he will make it a serious businesse, as if this should be his every dayes worke; <hi>All the dayes of my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time will I waite.</hi> Some reade it of my appointed warfare; and others of my appointed labour; they all intimate that hee meanes by his appointed time; his appointed life; the lease or terme of breathing, which God had allotted, allowed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed.</p>
                  <p>There are two propositions which naturally issue from the words, and comprehend the juyce and marrow of the Text.</p>
                  <p>First, that there is a change, which will befall the sonnes of men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, we should alwayes waite till it come; I begin with the first, that
There is a change which will befall the sonnes of men. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A change wil befall all the sonnes of men.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Be we poore, or bee we rich; bee we noble, or bee we igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; be we prosperous, or be we afflicted; be we strong, or be we weake; be we old, or be we young; be we good, or be we bad; be we male, or be wee female; whatsoever our natures bee, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our parts be, whatsoever our places be, whatsoever our ages be, whatsoever our courses be, whatsoever our wayes be; how faire and how durable our estates may appeare, yet at length there is a change which will befall us. That which <hi>Iacob</hi> spake in a patheticall way, <hi>Ioseph is not, and Simeon is not,</hi> may truly be
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:14764:396"/>
said of all the sonnes of men; once they were, now they are not: though once we reckoned them upon our account, yet at length they are shut out, and stand aside as cyphers.</p>
                  <p>But that you may the better understand what change it is that is here meant, you are to know, that there is a fourefold change.</p>
                  <p>First, a change of the condition, this I call a temporall change, wherein some, or more, or all, of our outward c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>mforts, are shrivelled, and feared up by some present miserie. When pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie breakes in upon us, as the hunter doth upon his game; and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth our riches as so many birds (to which <hi>Solomon</hi> compares them,) to take to themselves wings and flye away. When sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse stayeth our health in the bed, and imprisoneth us to the chamber. When our friends glide away from us, like a river through their Apostacie, or start aside like a broken bowe through their falshood or trecherie. When the neere relation of Husband and Wife, Parents and Children is cut asunder, and the many sad teares for their losse, imbitter all our former comforts. But this is not the change intended in the Text.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a change of the Body, and this I call a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall change, for even these vilde bodyes of ours shall bee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Looke as the spring is a refreshing change to the season of the yeare, so shall the Resurrection be an exceeding change to our bodyes; or as the morning is a change to the night, so at the Resurrection shall our bodyes awake, and their corruption shall put on incorruption; neither is this the change which <hi>Iob</hi> here intends immediatly, though some expound his ayme to be at this, from whom I cannot absolutely dissent, yet I thinke they hit not the right scope.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly there is a change of the Soule, that I call a Spirituall change, wrought in the soule by the Spirit of God: nothing makes in this life such a change as true grace. <hi>Wee all with open face, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding as in a glasse the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same Image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. This change is like the tuning of a disordered instrument, or like the refining of corrupt mettall, or like the clearing of the darke ayre; or like the quickning of a dead <hi>Lazarus;</hi> but neither is this change that the text intends.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, there is a change of the life, and this I call a mortall change, we shall all be changed, saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 5. life hath the first course, but death will have the second. As in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie severall persons, have severall parts to act, which when they have dispatched, they all draw off of the stage; so though in life we all present our selves on the stage of this world, and act se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Scenes and parts, yet at length we must all retire and passe away through one and the same doore of mortallity. This is the
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:14764:396"/>
change which <hi>Iob</hi> speakes of, to wit, a change of his life by Death.</p>
                  <p>Here then are two things to bee demonstrated, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for the making good of the point in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That death is a change. 2. That this change of death will befall all the sonnes of men.</p>
                  <p>First, that Death is a change, not an anihilation. A change is a different, and a divers order, or manner of being. Anihilation <note place="margin">Death a change, and why so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> is one thing, and mutation is another thing: there the thing ceaseth utterly to be: here the thing only ceaseth to be as once it was; so it is with Death, it doth not reduce us to nothing, but alter our former something, it changes our manner, or order of being, not our being absolutely,</p>
                  <p>Now observe, Death is a change in five respects;</p>
                  <p>First, it changes that neere union of the Soule and the body, and makes of one two severalls; they that were as the hands mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually clasping, or as two persons conjugally tyed together, when Death comes it plucks them asunder, and divides one from the other, as farre as heaven is from the earth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it changes our actions or worke. Whiles life remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned here in our bodies, while our day lasted, we might have fedde the hungry, clothed the naked, visited the sicke, r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ved the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed, frequented the ordinances, bewailed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>nnes, but when death once enters, the night is come, in which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>an can worke, thou art then turned, changed into an insen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ble, rotten, and loathsome carkasse.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it changes our countrey. Whiles we live here, wee are as children put abroad to schoole in a strange place; hence it is wee are so often in the Scripture called Pilgrims and strangers. This earth, this lower world is not the proper home of the Soule. But when Death comes wee change our countrey, wee goe home to our owne place, to our owne Citie; the wicked shall goe to their owne place, as it is said of <hi>Iudas;</hi> and the godly to their owne Mountaine, to their owne Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it changes our companie. In this life we converse with sinfull men, emptie creatures, infinite miseries, innumerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts; but when Death comes, all this shall be changed, wee shall goe to our God, and Father, to our Christ and Saviour, and <hi>to the innumerable company of blessed Angels and Saints, and the spirits of just men made perfect,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, it changes our outward condition. When Death comes thou shalt never see the wedge of gold againe, thou shalt never find thy delights in sinne any more, all the excellencie of the creature, and the contentments of them, and the sensuall rejoycing in them, shall goe out with life: Death shall shut and close them up in an
<pb n="804" facs="tcp:14764:397"/>
eternall night, which shall never rise to another day. So much for the first thing, that Death is a change. <note place="margin">The change by death must befall all men.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come now to speake briefly of the second, that this change of Death will be fall all the sonnes of men, <hi>Psal. 89. 48. What man is hee that liveth, and shall not see death, shall hee deliver his soule from the hand of the grave?</hi> We love to see most things, the eye is never satisfied with seeing, and yet many things there are which we shall never see. Every man cannot see that which one man doth, but there is one thing which every man shall see, hee must see death. There are many enemies from whom wee can deliver our selves, and many more from whom we may be delivered, but yet there is one enemie from which wee cannot defend our selves, nor bee defended by others, he will be to strong for every man; let him strive, repine, order his dyet, intreate, doe what hee will or can, No (saith the Psalmist) none shall deliver his soule from the hand of the grave. And he puts a <hi>Selah,</hi> a note of observation at the end of the verse.</p>
                  <p>That all the sonnes of men are subject to this change by death, will appeare to you by these familiar Arguments. The First may be taken from the qualitie of our lives, which is sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Reason 1.</note> set out in the Scripture under the termes of changeable things, all which point out unto us the certaintie of death; Sometime our life is compared to a shew, <hi>Psal. 39. 6, Surely every man walketh in a vaine shew.</hi> In a shew you know there is some devise or other ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, carryed a-while about, but at length it is shut up; so it is with our lives. Sometime againe it is compared to a shade or a shadow, <hi>Iob 8. 9. Our dayes upon earth are a shadow;</hi> a shadow is but an imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a substance, a kind of nimble picture which is still going and comming, and will set at last, perhaps it is suddenly ecclipsed, so is our life. Sometimes a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>aine it is compared to a vapour, <hi>Iames 4. 14. What is your life, it is even a vapour that vanisheth away,</hi> like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> poore cloude, sometimes looking white, sometimes blacke; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times quiet and settled, sometimes againe tossed up and downe with every wind, and at last consumed and brought to nothing, so it is with our lives. Sometimes also compared to a Tale, <hi>Psal. 90. 9. Wee spend our yeares as a tale that is told,</hi> a meere discourse of this thing, and that thing, and indeed but a very parenthesis of a more tedious discourse, and many times it is broken off in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry telling, so it is with our lives. Sometimes againe, it is as grasse, as in <hi>Esay 46. The voyce said crie aloude; what shall I crie, all flesh is grasse, and the goodlinesse thereof as the flower of the grasse.</hi> And verse 7. <hi>The grasse withereth, and the flower fadeth, because the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it.</hi> And <hi>Iob</hi> in this chapter calleth it a Flower, <hi>Hee commeth forth</hi> (saith he) <hi>like a flower, and is cut downe.</hi> A flower is a sweet thing, but of an earthly breed, fedde with
<pb n="805" facs="tcp:14764:397"/>
showres, at its best, when it is in all its glory, it is but to day, and to morrow, it withereth, and is fit for nothing but the Oven; so it is with our lives.</p>
                  <p>Many expressions of the like nature might be added, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is plentifull in these comparisons, comparing our life to the Spiders webbe, to a Weavers shuttle, to the breath of a candle, to a pilgrimage, to a journey, to the dayes of an hireling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all of them things of a changeable and variable nature.</p>
                  <p>The second argument may be taken from the qualitie of our <note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> Natures, and therein there are two things considerable, both which imply a certaintie of death.</p>
                  <p>First, our composition, and matter whereof we are made, wee are reared out of a mouldering and wasting principle, our bodies are therefore stiled an earthly house, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. A house though of Iron will in time be cankered; but a house of earth, as it is most impotent against assaults, so it is of its owne nature most apt, and subject to dissolution. And in this respect also they ar termed Tabernacles. Now a Tabernacle you know is a thing of no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuitie, made only to be soone set up, and that in a mans passage; and then asso one taken downe againe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, beside this there is in our nature, sinne and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this is it that doth put us to the sword, and cause this dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly change: this tares our lives with a continuall consumption. The tree breedes the worme, which will destroy the life of the tree; wee in <hi>Adam</hi> gave leave to sinne, and now it is that sin gives leave to death; <hi>In the day that thou shalt eate thereof, thou shalt surely dye, Gen.</hi> 2. 17. and <hi>Rom. 5. 12. By one man sinne entered into the world, and death by sinne, and so death passed over all men, in that all have sinned.</hi> The shadow doth not so neerely attend the body of man, as Death doth the body of sinne. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. the very <hi>wages of sinne is death.</hi> God should doe that man wrong that hath hired out his soule all his dayes to sinne, if he did not at night pay him with the wages of death.</p>
                  <p>The third Argument may be drawne from the certaintie of the <note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> Resurrection, wee all beleeve the resurrection of our bodyes, and and therefore wee must needes conclude a change of our bodyes, for what is the Resurrection but life from death, for <hi>the dead to heare the voyce of Christ and live?</hi> What is it but a breathing in of the soule againe, the lighting of the candle againe? the body could never be raised if it were not first changed; <hi>Thou foole,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>that which thou sowest is not quickned, except it dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth Argument is from the infallibilitie of Gods decree, <note place="margin">Reason 4.</note> 
                     <hi>it is appointed unto men once to dye, and after death to come to judgement, Heb.</hi> 9. 27. Thou mayest sooner expect, that the course of the
<pb n="806" facs="tcp:14764:398"/>
Heavens shall bee altered, and the Center of the earth bee dislocated, then that the purpose of God concerning mans mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie should bee reversed; nay, that may be, <hi>for heaven and earth shall passe away,</hi> but this shall never be, <hi>not one jot of the word of God shall fall to the ground.</hi> God hath purposed it; and none shall disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null it; nay, he hath established his purpose with a word of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, <hi>Gen. 2. in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt [surely] dye.</hi> As if hee should have said, Doe not deceive thy selfe, but build upon it, I have spoken it, and <hi>will not alter the thing that is gone out of my mouth;</hi> as sure as thou livest, if thou eatest, thou shalt dye.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see the first assertion cleared unto you, I will addresse my selfe now to the second, of which briefly too, and then make Application of them both together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As there is a certaintie of our change, so wee should alway waite till it doth come.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two things which I will here inquire of, for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler illustration of this point.</p>
                  <p>First, what this continuall wayting may import.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, why there should be such a constant wayting for the <note place="margin">1.</note> day of our mortall change.</p>
                  <p>First, this continuall wayting mainly imports two things; one acertaine expectation of death: for wayting is an act of Hope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting something, <hi>if wee doe hope for that wee see not, then doe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. What it is to waite for death.</note> 
                     <hi>wee with patience waite for it,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. A man is then sayd to wayte for death, when hee is looking for it at every turne, as a Steward waites for his Master when hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually expects his returne, when upon every voice hee heares, or upon every knocke at the doore, hee saith, oh my Master is come, this is hee that knockes. So a man is sayd to wayte for death, when in every action of his life, in every motion of his estate, in every passage of his courses, sayth; well I must dye, when though his bones are full of marrow, yet I must dye; when though riches come in like a flood, yet I must dye; when changes appeare upon himselfe, or others, yet I must dye, I have no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding here; <hi>I am but a sojourner, and a stranger, as all my fathers were.</hi> I must not enjoy my Wife for ever, Children for ever, Friends for ever, Lands for ever, these comforts for ever, my life for ever, it is but a lease which may soon expire; I am but a steward, and I must bee called to an account, such a one is gone before, and I must follow after; the writ of <hi>habeas corpus</hi> hath seized on him, and for ought I know the next may bee for mee, so when death comes, I am readie to answer it as <hi>Abraham</hi> did his Sonne <hi>Isaack, here I am;</hi> it comes not upon mee <hi>as a thiefe in the night,</hi> when I am a sleep and thinke not of him; but as <hi>Ionathans</hi> arrow to <hi>David,</hi>
                     <pb n="807" facs="tcp:14764:398"/>
who stayed in the field and expected when it should bee shot, and then hee rose up and embraced him: <hi>Yee Brethren</hi> (sayth <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Thes. 5. 4.) are not in darknesse, that that day should overtake you as a theife, ye are all the children of the light, therefore let us not sleepe as doe others, but let us watch and bee sober.</hi> This is the first thing that way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting imports. Another thing it imports, is a serious preparation for the day of our change; for it is not a naked expectation of a change, arising from the certainty of death; but it is also a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preparation, improving the interim of time for the best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for a mans soule before the day of change doth come, which is here implyed in wayting. <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it a remembring, <hi>Eccles. 12. 1. Remember thy Creatour in the dayes of thy youth, whiles the evill dayes come not, and the yeares draw nigh, when thou shalt say I have no pleasure in them:</hi> what is this remembring of the Creatour? but a care to know him, a feare to offend him, a studie to obey him: and when is that to bee done? Now, <hi>now remember:</hi> there must bee a present acting of this; <hi>Moses</hi> calls it a <hi>numbring of our dayes, Psal.</hi> 90. 12. and more then that, such a numbring as is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with an <hi>applying of our hearts to wisedome:</hi> and the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wisedome it directs to the choyce of such particular actions and works, as tend to happinesse; so should a man (after his seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous consideration of death) applie himselfe to such wayes and such actions, by which hee may comfortably close up his life with death; it is a great point of wisedome to sute actions with their ends, to fit and square the wood before wee build the house; to learne and discipline a troope before they goe to battell; to rigge and trimme and furnish the shippe, before wee launch to sea, this is preparation indeed.</p>
                  <p>Now this preparation for death consists in two things. First, <note place="margin">Wherein the preparation for death consists.</note> in an undoing of that which unfits us to dye: Brethren, hee who is not fit to live, hee is not yet fit to dye; and that which ever ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters the life, will be of greatest force in death. The Father spake <note place="margin">1 In freeing our selves from sin in our life. time.</note> it boldly on good grounds, <hi>I am not ashamed to live, nor afraid to dye:</hi> now that which unfits a man to dye is sinne, it makes him finde a bitter enemie of death. Oh when this <hi>King of terrours</hi> shall present himselfe by thy bed side with his arrowes in his hands, I meane thy sinnes; hee will wound thee with infinite amazement and horrour; <hi>the sting of death is sinne,</hi> saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Thou dost not prepare thy selfe for death, if thou dost not undoe thy sinnes which thou hast done in thy life: the which consists</p>
                  <p>First, in a narrow search of thy sinfulnesse, both of nature, and <note place="margin">How that is done.</note> practice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in a secret humbling of thy soule for them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in an unfeigned repentance and forsaking of them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in a constant imploring and obtainig of mercie for
<pb n="808" facs="tcp:14764:399"/>
them, in the bloud of Christ. If thy soule doth give sinne its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge now, death shall give thy soule a discharge hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the quallifying our persons for the conquest of death; there are three things by which wee shall bee able cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <note place="margin">2. In having our persons quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> to meet, and assuredly to conquer death.</p>
                  <p>First, by having interest in the Lord Jesus, <hi>The sting of death is sinne, and the strength of sinne is the Law; but thankes bee to God who</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">How that is done.</note> 
                     <hi>hath given us victorie through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> If thou hast gotten Christ into thy armes by faith, thou carriest thy peace, strength, and advantage both through life and death. <hi>For wee are more then conquerours through him that loved us,</hi> sayth the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 37. <hi>And to mee to live is Christ, and to die is gaine,</hi> sayth the same Apostle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 21. if thou hast a good Christ, thou mayst bee confident of a good death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, renewednesse of our nature. What Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> spake of the Martyrs (as some conjecture) <hi>Blessed and happie is he that hath part in the first resurrection, on such the second death hath no power;</hi> that say I of a person renewed by the sanctifying qualitie of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; I, happie is hee, hee shall have power even over the first death. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride sayth come;</hi> if a man hath gotten the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit which beautifies the soule with the ornaments of Grace, as the Bride is with her ornaments; hee is a fitted person, hee may well say to Death <hi>come,</hi> and to Christ, <hi>come Lord Iesus, come quickly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, uprightnesse of conversation; <hi>Righteousnesse delivers from death,</hi> sayth <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>the righteous hath hope in his death;</hi> if a mans worke be Christs service, if hee have a heart enclined to keepe a good conscience in all things, to keepe himselfe exact to the rule, and to walke with God; <hi>Blessed is that servant, which his Master when he commeth shall find so doing:</hi> that man that hath looked to Gods Word to guide his life, may confidently look up to Gods mercie, to comfort him in death. <hi>Remember, O Lord,</hi> (sayth <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah Isa. 39.) how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, all this doth the wayting for our change import in the Text, to wit, a serious expectation of it; first by undoing those sinnes of ours, which else for ever will undoe us, and by interest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our persons into Christ, from whom we must likewise receive the Spirit to change our hearts, and uprightnesse to forme a-new our conversation. But then you will say, Why must there be such a wayting for this? these grave clothes are too sadde for the fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <note place="margin">Why we must wayte and be prepared for death.</note> of our life; and would you have us be like the mad-man in the Gospell, who lived among the Sepulchres? Nay, I beseech you let us consider, and settle our thoughts a little, and you shall be stayed with reason; there are many strong Arguments and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="809" facs="tcp:14764:399"/>
why we should thus waite, both by expectation and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>First, it is the maine errand of our life; God did not send us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Reason 1.</note> this world to sinne, and to adorne our selves with the creature, but to bring him some honour, and then to dye: the factor is not imployed to take his pleasure abroad, but to doe his Masters worke, and then to returne home. <hi>Tertullian</hi> confesseth he was a great sinner, and therefore borne to repentance; therefore doth God give us life, as the Master allowes the servant a candle to worke by, that we may repent of our sinnes, and get our hold in Christ, and worke out our salvation, and doe the great busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of beleeving, to be good, and to doe good, and so by Death to goe up to heaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, death is but once, and that needs to bee well done <note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> which can be but once done; if there might be another space after death, a second edition to correct the faults, and escapes of the former, then a present and speedie preparation were not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so necessarie; but saith the Apostle, <hi>It is appointed for all men [once] to dye, and after death to come to judgement,</hi> Heb. 9. 27. no more but once. Wee usually shadow out Death with an houre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasse; A fit Embleme, but that when an houre-glasse is runne out, it may bee turned againe; but this once out, can be set up no more, thou shalt never live to amend thy errours in dying; O then how needfull is it before-hand to prepare for Death!</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when death hath done with thee, then God will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> with thee; thou must once die, and after this come to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. To judgement, what is that? thou must bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented before the holy, and just, and great God, who is the Judge of the quicke and the dead, and with all that thou art, and with all that thou hast done, there must appeare then before him all the courses of thy life; all the bent of thy affections, all the secrets of thy heart shall then be pulled in peeces, and opened, and all thy workes, and all thy words shall bee exhibited, scann'd, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, and that with severity and righteousnesse; how say you then, is it not fit to be preparing for Death, to fit thy soule, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thy heart and life? wilt thou be presented before Gods se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Judgement-seat with Usurie in thy baggs, with bribes and oppression in thy hands, with a scumme of holinesse in thy mind, with uncleannesse in thy members, with drunkennesse in thy mouth, with swearing in thy tongue? O Lord, I tremble to thinke of it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the soule when it is once gone by Death, can never <note place="margin">Reason 4.</note> be recovered any more, the tree may be cut, and that may grow againe, the shippe may be lost, and the wealth laboured up againe, but if the glasse be broken in peeces, it cannot bee made whole
<pb n="810" facs="tcp:14764:400"/>
againe; the soule of man is but one, and the losse of that one, is the losse of it for ever; when death hath closed up thy eyes, thou shalt never have opportunitie to pray more, to weepe more, to humble thy selfe more, to fast more. Never any Prophet or Apostle shall come unto thee in the Name of God more; after death all the Ordinances cease unto thee for ever, and all the space of returning shall cease unto thee for ever; thou shalt not lye a fewyeares in flames of wrath, and then get leave to come out and take a better course; O no, if once there, then for ever there; this life is the time of mercy and space of repentance, but when Death shall deliver thee up to be judged by the Lord, thou must stand for ever to his sentence; therefore as Christ spake, <hi>Agree with thine adversary while thou art in the way, lest the Iudge deliver thee to the officer, and hee cast thee into prison; I tell thee thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the last mite,</hi> Luk. 12. 58. And get oyle into your lampes before the doore be shut.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, consider it will be as much as thou canst doe, to doe the <note place="margin">5.</note> worke of Death, when Death doth come, therefore prepare and get all thy other worke done before.</p>
                  <p>For, my Beloved, consider three things;</p>
                  <p>First, Conscience usually is most active at the time of death; <note place="margin">1.</note> a man that could withstand, and silence it in his life, yet when hee comes to dye, he shall heare his voyce, and perhaps not bee able to stand under the bitter inditements, and manifold accusations of it; then it will spread the booke of thy life before thee, and then, and there thou shalt see thy sinnes as gastly presented, as if they were so many wounds newly made.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thy patience will bee tryed with varietie of paine, <note place="margin">2.</note> interruption of sleepe, every place will be a thorne to thee, and every action a burden.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thy faith may be tryed to the utmost, if thou lookest <note place="margin">3.</note> to thy Wife, her teares may trouble thee; if to thy Children, their cryes may perplexe thee; ifto thy friends, they may bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforters to thee; and will Satan let thee alone all this while, will he let him lye downe in comfort, who would not scarce let him live an houre in peace? oh what a victory would it be, if hee could at the last make thee cast a way thy confidence! it is true he cannotattaine it, but he may desperately attempt it. Why bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who knoweth the power of those sharpe temptations which may then beset him? Verily, all the holinesse which we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained already, all the duties we have performed already; we may then looke on them with teares, and cry out, O why no sooner? why no better? why no more? then all the strength of thy faith will be little enough to support thee.</p>
                  <p>Will there then be a change befall even all the sonnes of men.
<pb n="811" facs="tcp:14764:400"/>
Then (to make some Use and Application of what hath beene <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> said to ourselves.) First, build no Tabernacls here; <hi>Wee have here no abiding Citie.</hi> And, <hi>brethren,</hi> (saith the Apostle) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 29, 30, 31. <hi>The time is short, it remaines that they that have wives, bee as if they had none; and they that weepe, as though they wept not; and they that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>oyce, as though they rejoyced not,</hi> &amp;c. Why this thirst for riches? there will bee a change; why this unwearied seeking after the things of this life, as if thy soule were to goe into a barne, or a bagge, and there tumble it selfe for ever? <hi>Thou foole, this night may thy soule bee taken away, and whose possessions shall then thy carefull and only gettings bee?</hi> the glasse will be broken, and all the wine will flye abroad: though thou hast with much eagernesse grasped the world in this life, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>et in death thy hands must open them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and let it goe; thou must not hold the world above thy life, nor thy life beyond the day of death; no, wee cannot alway have that which we desire, wee must certainly part with what we most esteeme of.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what comfort is this to a good soule! <hi>If wee had hope</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> 
                     <hi>onely in this life</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Paul) wee of all men are most miserable,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Death is a happy change to a holy person:</p>
                  <p>First, it is a change which shall put a period to all his changes in this life: his outward condition, how of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> doth it change? some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time <note place="margin">1</note> by joy and sorrow, sometime by comfort and miserie, by health and sicknesse, by abundance and want, but when Death comes, all sorrow shall flye away for ever; thou shalt never bee more troubled with a sick body, with a sad estate, with common losses; but the change of a temporall life, shall set thee in a full and settled possession of an heavenly. His inward condition how oft doth it change? sometime free, anon distressed; now a sweet view of heaven, anon darkned with feare; now rejoycing in Christ, anon buffeted with Sathan; now blessing God for grace, anon distracted, with the insolent workings of remaining corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but when Death comes, then comes a change of all this, it will release thee for ever of sinne and Sathan; after death sinne shall be a burden no more, and Sathan shall be a tempter no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but thou shalt be as happy as thou canst desire, and shalt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy thy God, and thy Christ, without feare or trouble, in glory, in felicitie, in eternity; all the cruell insolences of tyrants, shall come short of thy soule, thou shalt be above their malice, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thy selfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a change, and no worse then a change, just as <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>Ioseph</hi> changed his garments, and went into <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> so thou shalt put off thy body, and goe into glory; put off thy mortality, and goe into immortalitie.</p>
                  <p>Oh whatterrour to wicked men! a day of change will befall <note place="margin">Vse 3.</note>
                     <pb n="812" facs="tcp:14764:401"/>
them! Why didst thou say Oh <hi>David there is no bands in their death, and they are not in changes like other men?</hi> Verily I should have checked thee, hadst thou not recanted it presently thy selfe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 4. 17. 18. 19. and reported it to us, that they are set in slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie places, and are brought into desolation, and cast down into destruction in a moment, and utterly consumed with terrour; Good Lord, what a change is that to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they judged with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent and unrighteous judgement the Children of God now, but death will change this; the unjust steward shall be called to an account, and he that beat his fellow servant, shall bee eternally judged by a righteous God, and their honour shall sincke in the dust, neither shall their riches deliver them from wrath, but they shall see him whom they have peirced and persecuted, and shall not be able to escape his presence. A dismall thing will this bee, that a man shall have his honour die, and the great God put dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace upon him; a dismall change indeed, when a man shall see all his power changed into impotencie, his pleasures into torment, and wrath put upon his soule; when God shall separate thee from his presence, thou shalt not have a drop of ease, nor any friend to assist thee, nor any hope of comfort, thou shalt bee stript of them all, and in a moment shall a change of all this bee. O considr this (if there be any here) that forget God, least he teare you in peeces and there bee none to helpe; remember and consider your latter end, and applie your hearts to wisedome.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, shall there be a change that shall befall every sonne of man? then, <hi>Oh that this people were wise</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> sayth, <hi>that they</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Vse. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>would remember their latter end,</hi> all the dayes of our appointed time, to waite till our change come. What do you thinke of servants to whom you had committed servile employments till you came home; and if when you come home they were absent, and you found one in the street drunke, another in a chamber with a strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, how would you take this? Brethren thinke upon it; we are Gods servants, or should bee; two things are imposed upon us, one to honour God, another to save our owne soules: if hee finde us doing the workes of the Divell, and the flesh, and finde us in the workes of the World, how will hee take this? Come saith God, I have lent you a life thus many years, I told you what you should be, and what you should doe, and what have you beene doing all this life? what have your workes been? what courses have you taken? are these the fruits of your waies, to have a life runne over with ignorance, with prophanesse, &amp;c. Alas! when a man at that time shall have nothing to say but, Lord, I have lived in such a sin all my dayes. I have fulfilled my owne desires; thou hast set mee in this World, and I have laboured to get a great estate all my dayes: Another may say, I have spent my time in drunken socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="813" facs="tcp:14764:401"/>
&amp;c. What will God say to these men? are these the endings of thy life, the fruits of thy opportunities? where is the repentance I called for at thy hands? where is that godly sorrow that I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for, for the sins of thy life? did not I send thee into the world for this end, to get Grace, to get Faith, to make up thy accounts with mee thy God, and hast thou no regard to it? Well thou hast beene foolish, inconsiderate for the time that is past; yet now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that a day of change will befall thee. O let us be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I beseech you bee perswaded to it, <hi>in this our day, to know the things that concerne our peace, whilest it is called to day not to harden our hearts;</hi> whilest it is called to day not to deferre our repentance, thou art not assured of any more time then present; Death may meet with thee as thou settest in thy seat, as thou goest out of the Church doore, and thou knowest thy heart hath beene wicked; oh why wilt thou set thy eternall estate upon so small a point, as it were the cast of a Die. Remember what <hi>Daniel</hi> sayd to <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar,</hi> let it have acceptance with thee; <hi>breake off thy sinnes by repentance,</hi> &amp;c. Seing we must dye, and appeare before the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seate of God, what manner of persons ought we to bee in all holinesse of life and conversation? as soone as we are we begin to sinne, and as soone as wee are wee begin to dye, let us looke upon our account and bee faithfull to our soules; perhaps thy accounts are yet to make, oh bee sure to let it bee the first thing thou doest, and give thy selfe no rest till thou hast done it; and when thou hast done this, labour to cleare it with the bloud of Christ, labour by humble confession, and hearty repentance to turne unto the Lord; goe on in a holy course, and then assuredly wee shall live with joy, and dye with peace; when wee can get grace in our soules, sorrow for our sins, newnesse in our natures, reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our lives, uprightnes in our waies, faith in Christ, a discharge from God, peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; oh what a happie day, the day of death will bee to our Soules!</p>

                  <p>When <hi>Euripides</hi> was taxed as too great a favourer of the female Sex, because in all his Tragedies he brought in vertuous women, and fitted them with good parts to Act; whereas <hi>Sophocles,</hi> and other Poets of that Age, brought lewd and immodest women u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Stage, and put odious parts upon them; hee made this Apologie for himselfe: others sayth hee, in their Poems set forth women as they are, but I, such as they should be: <hi>Solomons</hi> words are capable of a like construction, <hi>desire fayleth because man goeth to his long home:</hi> that is, it doth in the best, and should in all; for what a preposterous thing were it, for a man that hath one foore alreadie in the grave, and is drawing the other after, to desire to cut a crosse caper, and dance the morrice? or for him that is neere his eternall Mansion hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

an Inne. Moreover, <hi>Solomon</hi> here speaketh of a <hi>Barzillai,</hi> who hath no taste of his meate, no sence of delight; no use, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, of sense, to whom dainties are no dainties, because hee cannot taste them; musicke is no musicke, because hee cannot heare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>And so I come to the third Stage, which is the litterall sense and genuine interpretation of the words. <note place="margin">The sense.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>As in <hi>Origen</hi> his Hexapla, every word almost had an Asterisk, or starre upon it; so there needs a starre or some other light to be put upon every word of this Text, for there is a mist of obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie upon each of them, and a man may well misse his way, if hee know not exactly, who is here the man? what's meant by his <hi>going,</hi> or gate? where is <hi>his long home?</hi> and whence are these <hi>Mourners?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, whether man bee taken <hi>Collectivè</hi> for the whole kinde, or <hi>Species,</hi> as the Logicians speake; or <hi>Distributivè</hi> for every <note place="margin">Que. 1.</note> man in particular, wee shall seeme to bee at a losse. Man taken <hi>Collectivè,</hi> stirres not a foot to his <hi>long home;</hi> for Philosophie reprieveth universall natures from death, or dissolution: and true it is, though single men every day dye, yet mankinde dieth not: If man bee taken <hi>Distributivè,</hi> for all particular men of what ranke or qualitie soever, wee shall have much to doe to distinguish the men in the former part of the Text, from the mourners in the latter. If all are attended with mourners to their funerall, then mourners themselves must have mourners; and so either the traine will bee infinite, or the lag will bee destitute of mourners.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, why useth hee this phrase of going, if it import <note place="margin">Que. 2.</note> death, sith some expect death and move not at all towards it; some runne to it, to some it is sent; some leape into it, as <hi>Cleombrotus;</hi> some ride to it in state, as <hi>Antiochus Epiph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, where is this <hi>long home?</hi> in Heaven, or in Earth, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, <note place="margin">Que. 3.</note> or Hell? If wee speake of Heaven, or Hell, the Epithet <hi>long</hi> falls short, for they are eternall habitations: of Purgatorie, or the grave (suppose there were any Purgatorie) yet neither of them may bee properly termed a <hi>long home,</hi> sith neither the bodie

stayes long in the one, nor the soule in the other.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, whence are these <hi>mourners?</hi> if they are mercenarie <note place="margin">Que. 4.</note> and hyred from home, they are no true mourners; if they are true mourners, they keepe their Closets, they gad not about the streets, they shut themselves long at home for their friends that are gone to their <hi>long home.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To dispell all this mist of obscuritie, and set a light upon each of the materiall words of the Text, I answer.</p>
                  <p>To the first Quere, that a <hi>man</hi> is here to be taken, neither <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective</hi>

As for the last men that shall stand upon the earth, and shall bee alive at Christs comming; they shall indeed passe by death properly, yet they shall dye after a sort, by passing from a mortall state, to an immortall; and if their long home bee Heaven, they shall need no mourners; if Hell, they shall want none to beare them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, for at Christs second comming <hi>all kindreds of the earth shall mourne before him.</hi> I answer</p>
                  <p>To the second, that going here is not taken <hi>pro motu progressivo,</hi>

Among the <hi>Romans,</hi> the friends of the deceased hyred certaine women whom they called <hi>preficas,</hi> to lament over their dead: for the most part among the <hi>Iewes</hi> this sad taske was put upon widowes, or they tooke it upon themselves, as the words of the Prophet imply, and <hi>there were no widowes to make lamentation;</hi> and of the Evangelist also, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 39. and <hi>the widowes stood by weeping for Dorcas;</hi> and indeed widowes are very proper for this imployment: When a Pot of water is full to the brimme, a little motion makes it runne over.

                  <p>The Doctrine,</p>
                  <p>Mans life is a voyage, his death the terme or period of this <note place="margin">The Doct.</note> voyage, his Grave his home, and Mourners his attendance; you may observe a kind of sequence in these observations in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catination of them; the first link drawes the second, the second the third, the third the fourth; if our life be a pilgrimage, our death must needes be the terme and our arivall at our Countrey, if Death bee our arrivall, the Grave must needes bee the house for our bodyes, if the Grave bee our house, what fit atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance there but mourners?

I am a stranger, and sojourner, as all my fathers were, Vita est via, &amp; omnes Christianus viator,</hi> Our life is a way, and every man living in this world a passenger. A direct motion, and that continuate, and uninterrupted from the cradle to the coffin, from the wombe to the tombe, is the way of all flesh, a way in which children walk, before they can goe; and old men crawle, when they cannot now goe; Infants who never had the use of their limbes, and impotent old who have lost them, yet runne this race, wherein though some make a longer line, and others a shorter, yet all finish their course: a strange race, wherein though a man stand still or sleepe, yet hee advanceth forward, and gaineth ground; and he goeth so much the faster, by how much he is the weaker, for the lesse vigorous, the more speedily he tends to his long and last home: the houre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasse is running, whether the Preacher proceeds, or makes a pawse; and the shippe is sayling whither it is bound, when wee sleepe in our cabbine: so whether wee wake or sleepe, moove or rest, be busie or idle, minde it, or mind it not, we walke on toward our long home.</p>

And thus as before the old man, so now the new man goeth to his long and eternal home, without any resting place betweene, at which all the ordinary sort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Romanists must bait, though little for their ease, cooling or refreshing, for it is in a hot-house; nay, a house all on fire; nay all of fire, and that as hot as hell; I meane <hi>Purgatory,</hi> wherewith if <hi>Solomon</hi> had beene acquainted, hee would have changed this <hi>motto of mortalitie,</hi> and not have said, <hi>man goeth to his eternall home;</hi> but to his purging bath, and the Friers goe about the streetes singing Masses and Dirges for his soule; assuredly if the soules of those that die under the Gospell need a sacrifice to deliver them from the torment of a temporarie hell, or <hi>Purgatorie</hi> fire, the soules of them that died under the Law much more needed it; why then did <hi>Moses</hi> appoint none for them? why did none of the inspired Prophets pray for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease of their soules? <hi>Solomon</hi> if there had beene such a stop in the mid-way, would have made a pawse in his speech, and not said im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>immediately man goeth <hi>In domum eternitatis suae,</hi> into his everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting home, as the Seventie, and the vulgar Latine, (which no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist upon paine of a curse, can reject,) render the Hebrew <hi>Beth gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomo.</hi> Purgatorie is no such home; therefore <hi>Gregorie</hi> of <hi>Neocesarea,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> so expound this Text, that they quite leave out this immaginarie fire kindled in the paper walls of Purgatorie. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> saith, the good man marcheth out joyfully towards his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <note place="margin">Aevi tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis fine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleto ad eterna vel mortis vel immortalitatis hospitia divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimur.</note> house, but the wicked drawes backe and bedewes the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold with teares, and fills all with lamentations: and that wee may know when a man taketh possession of his eternal home, Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> tels us it is upon the expiring of our lease in the poore tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our body.</p>

But I list not to dwell any longer in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, because there is no such reall place, either in the world, or out of it. I am now come, though long first, to mans long home, which cannot be described in a short time, and therefore I leape into my last stage, which as you may remember was;</p>
                  <p>The Application of the Text to this sad occasion. As a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <note place="margin">Application</note> order is used in a compositive method, to that which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a resolotive, so I must now use in the Application of my Text, a method direct contrary to that which I followed in my Explication: for therein first I shewed you how the naturall man goeth to his long, and the Spirituall to his eternall home; and after how, and why, and what sort of Mourners went about the streetes lamenting the deceased; but now I am first to speake of the Mourners, who have already finished their circular motion, and then of the direct motion of the <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>man</hi> of qualitie, the <hi>man</hi> of worth, the <hi>man</hi> of estate and credit, who is already arived at his <hi>long Lete,</hi> and now entering into his long home.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Mourners I cannot but take notice of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and qualitie; the number is great we see, yet wee see not all who yet are the truest Mourners, pouring out their soules to God with teares in their private closets.

                  <p>Her portion of sorrow like <hi>Benjamins,</hi> is five times more then any others whose losse of a Husband, and such a Husband is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable. Secondly, the qualitie of the Mourners is not slightly to be passed by, <hi>debetur iis religiosa mora;</hi> for, not only great store of the Gentrie and Commons, but some also of the Nobilitie, the chiefe Officers of the Crowne, and Peeres of the Realme; not Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only and learning, but Honour and Justice also hath put on Blackes for him, thereby testifying to all men their joynt-respect to him, and misse of him. And if any prompted by <hi>Iudas</hi> shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject against this Solemnitie, and prolixe ceremonie <hi>ut quid perditio ista?</hi> To what serves this waste? might not the money have been better expended in charitable almes, to the reliefe of very many poore. I answer in the words of our Saviour, <hi>Haec oportet facere, &amp; illa non omittere;</hi> Those workes of charitie they spake of, ought to be done: and these of decent Rites and ceremonies not to be left undone: the rule of the Apostle, Let all things be done decently and in order, is a warrant as well for the due Exequies of the dead as Obsequies of the living: if all things must be done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, and in order, in the State and Common-wealth, much more in the Church, whose embleme is, <hi>Acies ordinata,</hi> an Armie marshalled in excellent order, with Banners displayed; and if all
<pb n="831" facs="tcp:14764:410"/>
things in the Church must bee so carried then Funeralls as well as Nuptialls, Burials as well as Christnings; and if so, then ought they to bee celebrated not after the preposterous manner of some in the night as workes of darknesse: but in the day as works of Pietie, in honour of them who have received the inheritance of Saints in light, not penuriously and basely, but nobly and liberally; where the quality of the dead requireth it, and the estate will beare it. Howbeit I confesse, that as Magnificence is alwayes a vertue, so prodigalitie is a vice; and one of those master-vices which hath gotten a great head in this Kingdome, and a Garland upon it. Yet to doe the dead right, though luxurie bee guiltie of the death of many: yet the dead are no way guiltie of this su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluirie, they neither order it, nor are sensible of it; neither is the prodigalitie (under the weightie burden whereof the Land groaneth) so much seene in blacke clothes, as in Silkes and Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vets, cloth of Gold and Tissue; not in Jeat as in Pearle, and precious stones; not in building Marble Sepulchres for the dead, as Marble houses for the living; not in armorie, as in luxurie; not in pendants, as in attendants; not in Funeralls, as in Nuptials, Maskes and Pageants, Court entertainments, and Citie feasts, at which if <hi>Vitellius</hi> or <hi>Apicius</hi> were bidden, they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne themselves for too much frugalitie. What <hi>Seneca</hi> spake of time, <hi>solius temporis prodigi sumus, cujus unius honesta est avaritia,</hi> wee are lavish of our time, of which covetousnesse is onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; we may invert, and with truth confesse, we are frugall for the most part in those things (I meane the service of the living God, and offices of pietie to the dead) wherein not only bounty, but magnificence also is most commendable. If any bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes minded, and repine and grudge at this last honour to the dead, and comfort to the living; I shall use no other reproofe of him at this present, then a like to that of <hi>Constantine</hi> recorded in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> 
                     <q>Goe to <hi>Acesias</hi> who art so precise, and holdest none wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to keepe pace with thee, <hi>fac scalam, &amp; ascende solus in coelum</hi> Make a ladder, and climbe up alone upon it to heaven:</q> so let these men make them a Bere like the new-found Chariots in the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countreyes, that runne of themselves without a driver, and let them be carried alone in it to their long home; Let no Mourners follow them, nor eye pittie them, or shed teare for them.

So kinde a Landlord, that when his Tennants were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde with him, hee was so farre from suing them, or putting them to trouble to extort his due from them; that instead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving from them, hee lent great summes unto them; by the good employment whereof they were enabled to recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and pay him. So liberall a Patron hee was, that hee not onely freely bestowed all the Benefices that fell in his gift, but was also at all the charge of institution, induction, composition, first-fruits, and whatsoever burthen fell upon the Incumbent: Such patterns of Patrons, wee may rather wish then hope for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; what shall I need to adde more concerning him, whose birth was illustrious, his education liberall, his Patromonie great, his Matches sutable, his life exemplarie, and his death co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable? Single vertues wee meet with in many, but such combinations as were in him, such affabilitie in such gravitie, such humilitie in such eminencie, such patience in such tryalls, such temperance and moderation in such abundance, as we have just cause to blesse God for in him, so we have great cause to pray for in others of his Ranke. In his tender yeares hee was set as a choyce Plant in the famous Nurserie of good learning and Religion, the Universitie of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where living as a Commoner in <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Colledge, under the care and tuition of Doctor <hi>Sebastian Wenfield;</hi> hee very much thrived and grew above his equalls both in grace and in knowledge, gaining to himselfe as much love, as learning. After hee was removed from thence, hee fell into very great troubles, as well before as after the death of his Father, but the Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him out of all: These crosses and afflictions served but as Files to brighten those gifts and graces in him, which shined af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards most brightly in his moresetled estate, and eminent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, being chosen Deputie Lievetenant in <hi>Wiltshire;</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner in three Shires, Foure times High-Sheriffe, and often knight for the Shire in Parliament; in all which places of important negotiations and great trust, hee so carried himselfe, that all men might see in all his actions, hee had a speciall eye to the Motto in his Escouchion, <hi>Ieay bonne cause,</hi> for with <hi>Mary</hi> hee alwayes chose the good part, and stood up for the truth, which hee confirmed with his last breath. You have heard what hee was in publicke, but what was hee in private? wee have seene him in the Sunne, how demeaned hee himselfe in the shade?

The first of these was tendernes of conscience, which is one of the most infallible to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens and markes of the Child of God; so tender was hee, that he would undertake no businesse before hee was fully perswaded of the lawfulnesse thereof, both by cleare texts of Scripture, and the approbation of most learned and conscientious Divines; hee made scruple, not onely of committing the least knowne sinne, but of imbarking into any action which was questionable among those that love the truth in sinceritie. And therefore, although God blessed him with great wealth, and store of coyne, yet hee never put it to Usurie or Interest thereby to increase it, for he held the tolleration of the Law in this Kingdome to bee no sufficient warrant for any violation of the divine Law, the distinctions late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coyned, of toothlesse and biting Usurie hee no way allowed, judging truly, that all Usurie according to the Hebrew Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, is biting, and hath not onely teeth, but Adders teeth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed; for all Usurie if it bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the yeares of dearth and sicknesse, he sent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision to all the Parishes about him, and thrice a weeke relieved a hundred atleast at his gate: neither did his compassion dye with him, for in his Will and Testament confirmed by him the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, hee bequeathed divers Legacies to the poore, whereof these following came to my notice.

The last <hi>aurea gutta</hi> which I shall present to your view at this time, was his fervencie of zeale for the truth of the Gospell; in all the Benefices which hee bestowed, hee tooke speciall care to make choice of men sound in the Faith, no way warping either to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish

                  <p>There is a great difference about the interpretation of this phrase, <hi>Ibis ad patres,</hi> and the reason of the difference is, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie which insueth upon every interpretation: For if we referre these words to the body of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the buriall thereof in the Sepulchres of his Fathers; this Exposition complieth not with the truth of the storie; for none but <hi>Sarah</hi> lay in this cave, <hi>Abrahams</hi> Fathers were else-where bestowed.

The righteous soule must for a time be divorced from the body as well as the foule of the wicked, and in the graves the <hi>Wormes claime kindred</hi> of the elect, as well as of the reprobate: the consideration whereof, put the Preacher into a passion, <hi>how doth the righteous man dye as well as the wicked?</hi> as it is said of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that hee is <hi>gathered to his Fathers;</hi> so it is sayd also of <hi>Ishmael</hi> and may bee of the wickedest man that breathes.

                  <p>First, an Apostrophe which by a kind of miracle of art giveth life to dead things, and eares to the deale, like to that, <hi>O earth, earth, earth, heart the voyce of the Lord.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 12. 29.</note>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a double Metaphor, the former taken from a Serpent, Bee, Waspe, or Hornet: the latter taken from a Conquerour: for Death is here compared to a Bee, Waspe, Hornet, or Serpent without a sting: the Grave to a Conquerour that hath lost his bootie, or prisoner, <hi>O Death,</hi> &amp;c. Such <hi>Drawne-workes wrought about with divers colours</hi> of Art, we find often in the Sacred <hi>context,</hi> especially in the Prophecies of the old Testament, and the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the new.

It is true, the Scripture is written in a style peculiar to it selfe, <hi>the elocution in it is</hi>

Thus have we viewed the forme, let us now have an eye to the matter, our Lords conquest over Death, and the Grave. There are two things most dreadfull to the nature of man, Death and the Grave, the one severeth the soule, the other consumeth the body, and resolveth it in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

How much then are wee indebted to our Christian faith, that not only overcommeth the world, but also conquereth the feare of Death, and the grave, and dareth both in the words of my Text; <hi>O death, sting mee if thou canst; O grave, conquer mee if thou bee able; O death, where is thy sting; O grave, where is thy victorie.</hi>

This <hi>sting of death</hi> is like the Adders, <hi>two forked</hi> or double; for <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> it is either originall or actuall sinne; originall sinne is the sting of death, <hi>in the day thou eatest of the Tree of knowledge, thou shalt</hi>

The answer is, if wee speake of the reprobate men, or Devills, it remaineth in their consciences; if wee speake of the Elect, it is plucked out of their soules, and it was put in our Saviours bodie, and there deaded and lost, for <hi>hee that knew no sinne, was made sinne

                  <p>The first interrogatorie is answered, wee know where Deaths sting is; let us now consider of the second interrogatorie, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the victorie of the Grave; <hi>O grave! where is thy victorie?</hi> If the Grave, as shee openeth her mouth wide, so she could speake, shee would answer: My victories are to be seene in <hi>Macpelah, Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotha;</hi> in all the gulphs of the Sea, and Caves and pits of the Earth, where the dead have beene bestowed since the beginning of the world. My victorie is in the fire, in the water, in the earth, in all Churnells and Caemitaries, or dormitories, in the bellies of fish, in the mawes of beasts, in holy shrines, Tombes and sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres, wheresoever corpses have beene put, and are yet reserved.

                  </p>
                  <p>Wee have spoken hitherto of Death and the Grave, let us now heare what they have to say to us.

<pb n="857" facs="tcp:14764:423"/>
Christ, rather delights and tickles you. Death is no more Death, but a sleepe; the Grave is no more a grave, but abed.</hi> Death is but the putting off of our old <hi>rags,</hi> the Grave is the <hi>Vestrie;</hi> and the Resurrection, the new <hi>dressing, and richly embroydering</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>Enough hath beene said to convince us, that Death which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was like a Serpent armed with a deadly sting, is now but like a silly flye that buzzeth about us, but cannot sting. Yet as long as there is sinne in us, we cannot but in some degree feare Death: and as long as naturall affection remaines in us, <hi>take on</hi> for them that are <hi>taken away.</hi> Neither doth Christian religion plucke out these affections by the roote, but only prune them. All that my exhortation driveth unto, is but to moderate passion by reason; feare by hope, griefe by faith, and nature by grace: Let love ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse it selfe, yet so that in affection to the dead, we hurt not the living: Let the <hi>naturall springs</hi> of teares <hi>swell,</hi> but not too much <hi>overflow</hi> their <hi>bankes:</hi> let not our eye be all upon our losse on earth, but our brothers gaine also in heaven, and let the one <hi>counter-ballance</hi> at least, the other.

It well agreeth with the Analogie of faith, and the meaning of the holy Spirit, and the Hebrew letter also will beare it; for <hi>Ehi</hi> (as <hi>Buxtorphius</hi> the great Master of the holy tongue, out of <hi>David Kimchi</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth) signifieth <hi>ubi where,</hi> as well as <hi>ero I will bee;</hi> and a <hi>venemous sting,</hi> and <hi>pestis</hi> the <hi>plague</hi> differ but little: so that although the words in the originall seeme to bee spoken by an affirmation, but in Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and the Septuagint, by an interrogation; in the one by a commination, inthe other by an insultation; yet both come to one sense, and containe an evident prophesie of Christ his conquest over Death and Hell.</p>

men decay before the <hi>Sythe of death</hi> cutts them; all other after.</p>
                  <p>Likewise, there is a great difference among flowers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some are for sight only, not for the smell, or any vertue in medicines; as <hi>Tulips, Emims,</hi> and <hi>Crowne Emperials.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some for sight and smell, but of no use in Medicines; as <hi>Sweet-williams,</hi> the <hi>painted Lady,</hi> and <hi>Iuly-flowers</hi> generally.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some are both for sight and smell, and of singular use in Medicines, as <hi>Roses and Violets:</hi> So some men are of better parts, and greater use in the Church and Common-wealth, others of lesse. Some flowers grow in the field, some in the garden: so some mens lives and improvements are publike, others private. Some flowers are put in Posies, some in Garlands, some are cast into the Still: so some men are better preferred then others, and some live and die in obscuritie.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, some flowers presently lose their colour and sent, as the <hi>Narcissus;</hi> some keepe them both long, as the <hi>red Rose:</hi> So some men continue longer in their bloome, grace and favour; others for a short time, but all fade, and within a while are either gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, cut downe, or withered of themselves and die. And for this reason it is as I conceive, that we sticke herbes and flowers on the Hearse of the dead, to signifie, that as we <hi>commit earth to earth, and ashes to ashes;</hi> so we <hi>put grasse to grasse, and flowers to flowers.</hi> For, <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>omnis caro foenum, All flesh is grasse, and all the goodlinesse thereof as the flower of the field, the grasse withereth, and the flower fadeth away;</hi> But the comfort is in that which followeth; <hi>But the word of the Lord endureth for ever, and this is the word which by the Gospell is preached unto you;</hi> Whereof this verse which I have read unto you for my Text, is part.</p>

<pb n="876" facs="tcp:14764:433"/>
in the Lord who is the Lord of life,</hi> if wee take the preposition in the proper sence: for though in the naturall bodie a member may bee cut off and dye, the head being alive; yet it is not so in the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bodie of Christ, no true Member thereof can bee cut off, much lesse dye, while it continues in that bodie; by dying in the Lord, therefore wee must understand dying for the Lord, <hi>so they.</hi>

                  <p>Others will have the words not to bee restrained to Martyrs onely, but to belong to all that die in the feare of God, and the faith of Christ.

                     <hi>Bernard</hi> and other of the Auncients apparantly distinguish these phrases, <hi>mori in Domino, &amp; mori propter Dominum,</hi> to <hi>dye in the Lord,</hi> and to <hi>dye for the Lord: mori pro Domino martyrum est, mori in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino omnium confessorum; si beati qui in Domino moriuntur, quanto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis qui pro Domino moriuntur? to dye for the Lord is the glory of martyrs,</hi> but to <hi>dye in the Lord, the glory of all Confessors: if they are happy who dye in the Lord, how much more they that dye for the Lord?</hi> Thirdly, the reward here promised is common to all beleevers, and not peculiar to the Martyrs: for all true beleevers when they dye rest from their labours, and their workes follow them. If the Spirit had meant Martyrs onely, hee would rather have sayd, they have ease from their torments, then rest from their labours, and their trophies and victories follow them. All that dye for <note place="margin">But <hi>è contra</hi> all that dye for the Lord, dye in the Lord. So Martyrs are not excluded though they are not inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alone, but all true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours with them.</note> the Lord, dye also in the Lord; but all that dye in the Lord, doe not necessarily dye for the Lord: wee denie not that the Martyrs have the greatest share in this blessednesse, but all Confessours have their partsalso? the Martyrs Crowne is beset with a Rubie or some richer jewell then ordinary, their Garland hath a flower or two more in it, to wit some red flower as well as white; yet the Crowne and Garland of all Confessours are compleat. And therefore not onely <hi>Beda,</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi> and <hi>Richardus,</hi> and <hi>Andreus,</hi> and <hi>Primasius,</hi> and <hi>Haymo,</hi> and <hi>Ansbertus,</hi> and <hi>Ioachimus,</hi> but also the <hi>Greeke,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; yea, and the reformed also <note place="margin">Vid Alcazo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum in Apoc. c. 14.</note> understand these words, of all that dye in Gods favour: for they read these words at the Funeralls of all the dead, and not onely at the Funeralls of Martyrs. Yea, but how can any bee sayd to dye in the Lord, that is continuing his Member, sith Christ hath no dead Members? I answer, that the faithfull dye not in the Lord in that sense in which they live in him; but in another they die not spiritually, nor cease to bee his mysticall Members; but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, that is, they continuing in Christs faith and love, breathe out their souies, and so fall asleepe in his bosome, or dye in his love, laying hold of him by faith, and relying on him by hope, and embracing him by charitie. All they dye in the Lord, who
<pb n="877" facs="tcp:14764:433"/>
die in the act of contrition, as Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> who reading the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netentiall Psalmes with many teares, breathed out his last gaspe, sighing for his sinnes. Or in the act of charitie as Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> who in a most fervent, or vehement exhortation to the love of God, gave up the ghost. Or in the act of Religion, as Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> who after he had received the blessed Sacrament, in a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly rapture, and a holy parley with Christ, left the body. Or in the act of Devotion as <hi>Aquinas,</hi> who lifting up his eyes and hands to heaven, pronouncing with a loude voyce those words of the Spouse in the <hi>Canticles, Come my beloved, let us goe forth,</hi> went out of this world. Or in the Act of gratulation, and thankes-giving as <hi>Petrus Celestinus,</hi> who repeating that last verse of the last Psalme, <hi>Omnis spiritus laudet Dominum, Let every breath; or every one that hath breath, praise the Lord,</hi> breathed out his soule. Or in an Act of divine contemplation, as <hi>Gerson</hi> that famous Chancellour of <hi>Paris,</hi> who having explicated fiftie properties of divine love, concluded both his Treatise, and his life with <hi>fortis ut mors dilectio, Love is strong as death.</hi> To knit up all, six sorts of men may lay just claime to the blessednesse in my Text.</p>

                  </p>

                  <p>To strike sayle and make toward the shore, if all that dye in the Lord are blessed, from the very moment of their death, and this blessednesse is confirmed by a voyce from heaven: let us give more heed to such a voyce, then to any whisper of the flesh or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell.

                  </p>
                  <p>But to leave other springs, this in my Text affordeth store of water to extinguish Purgatory fire; and therefore our adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries seeke to damme it up two manner of wayes: First by restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this Text to Martyrs onely, who die in the Lords quarrell, though their soules flye to heaven, their wings being not singed with this fire: yet others (say they) are not saved, but after some time of abode in it. Secondly, by cooling the heat of this fire, and making it not only tolerable, but also comfortable, bearing us in hand that they that are in Purgatory may be said to be blessed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they rest from the labours of this life, and they are secure of their eternall estate, they are sure to feele no other hell. From the first starting-hole I have beaten them already by demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that all that beleeve in Christ are ingrafted by faith into his mysticall body, and consequently, that as they live in him, so they die in him; in which regard the Apostle speaking of all that depart in the faith of Christ saith, <hi>they sleepe in the Lord,</hi> and <hi>die in Christ.</hi> Their second starting hole is lesse safe then the former, for to say that this blessednes and Purgatory paines may subsist in the same soule, is an assertion neither politique nor reasonable. First it is not politique; for if they coole Purgatory fire in such sort, they will stop the <hi>Popes Mint from going;</hi> perswade the vulgar that the soules in Purgatory are in a tollerable, nay (in some sort) in a blessed estate, because <hi>they rest from their labours and their workes follow them;</hi> and the Priests may set their heart at rest for gaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remarkable summes for Dirges, and the Popes tole-gatherers also for sucking any great advantage out of pardons to ransome soules out of Purgatory.</p>
                  <p>And as this answere standeth not with their profit: so neither agreeth it well with their owne tenents; for they teach that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory fire is as hot as Hell for the time, surpassing the smartest torment that can bee devised, or ever was endured on earth: and
<pb n="889" facs="tcp:14764:439"/>
call they those happy who lie soultring in this fire? yea, but when they are there they receive singular comfort in this, that they are sure they shall never go to hell. Surely small comfort to one who is in hellish torments and shall continue there he knowes not how long, to tell him that he is sure he shall goe to no other Hell: and how prove they that Purgatory is a supersedeas to Hell? What security have they for it? Gods Word? but in all Gods Word there is no sillable of Purgatory, neither let they the people to know Gods Word; for in Spaine, and generally where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition is in force, the proverbe is that he <hi>smels of a Faggot, who is found with a Bible about him in the mother tongue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things being so, I wonder that any ordinary Papist be willing to die, seeing the best hee can hope for is to bee cast presently into the flames of Purgatory, and there to frie hee knowes not how long, perhaps a hundred, perhaps a thousand yeares.</p>
                  <p>But (God be blessed for it) we have otherwise learned of Christ and his blessed Apostles. <hi>Wee know that if our earthly tabernacle bee dissolved, wee shall presently have</hi> not a temporary habitation in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, but <hi>an eternall in Heaven:</hi> wee know, that <hi>those who beleeve in Christ come into no condemnation, but passe from death to life.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us not <hi>take on</hi> too much for those whom God hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from us; let us not trouble our selves for them that are at rest; let us not shed over-many teares for them who can now shed no more teares; let us not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <item>4. When they overtake them.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The first difficulty is thus expedited: the workes of the dead are neere distinguished from their labours, as the fruit from the branches that beare them, the hyre from the day labour, the prize
<pb n="890" facs="tcp:14764:440"/>
from the race. As those who taste the fruit of a tree, are said by an Hebraisme to eate of the tree, <hi>to him that overcommeth</hi> (saith the Spirit) <hi>I will give to eate of the Tree of Life which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.</hi> So here in this Text workes are taken for the fruit of workes, or their recompence of reward.</p>
                  <p>But how are workes in this sense said to follow <hi>the dead?</hi> For all the works of the dead are either transient, as meditations, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <note place="margin">The second difficultie.</note> pious ejaculations, present relieving the poore, and the like; or, they are permanent as their writings, their building Colledges, Hospitalls, Churches and other Monuments of Pietie: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cannot follow the dead because they remaine not now, nor the latter, because they stay behind them here on earth. I answer, the speech is figurative, and signifieth no motion of the deads workes, but rather promotion of their persons, and plentifull remuneration for their workes; the phrase imports no more then that all their workes, whether they bee actions of Saints, or passions of Martyrs shall not come short of their guerdon, but shall bee most certainely and undoubtedly rewarded.

The workes of the damned indeed follow them thither; there they meet with them, and with the Divell who seduced them, to torment them for them; there the swearers and blasphemers gnaw their tongues; there the lascivious wantons are cast into a bed of fire; there they who swome here in pleasures, are throwne into a river of brimstone.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese words they afford to us a comfortable and sweet argument to bee conversant in. From the sixt verse of this Chapter, is set down to us the confirmation of the whole Prophesie and booke of the Revelation; partly by the affirmation of God, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of Jesus Christ, and of <hi>Iohn</hi> himselfe, that heard and saw all these things; and likewise of the Church of God in the 17. verse: it is likewise confirmed by the promise of blessing and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse pronounced upon them that shall doe all these things, and shall faithfully expect the accomplishment of them. This verse (a part of which I have read to you) is the repetition in few words of all that matter that goeth before, from the 6. verse to it: and hath in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="900" facs="tcp:14764:445"/>
First, an attestation of our Lord and Saviour Christ, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the verse. <hi>Behold I come quickly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, an acclamation of the Church, in the latter part, these words I have read to ye. <hi>Amen, even so come Lord Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the attestation of Christ, hee promiseth hee will come to his Church, hee will come shortly, both for the accomplishment of all his promises, and likewise for their safety and deliverance from all enemies, and all miseries, and molestations whatsoever. To this the Church makes an acclamation, and saith, <hi>Amen, even so come Lord Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this acclamation of the Church (to which wee must now come) we are to consider</p>
                  <p>First, the person of the speaker, whose words they bee.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what is the matter or substance contained in them.</p>
                  <p>Yee shall see whose words they bee, if ye looke backe but to the 17. verse of this Chapter, there ye shall finde, that first it is sayd, <hi>the Spirit sayth come.</hi> By the Spirit is not meant the third Person in Trinitie the holy Ghost, because hee is not subject to these passions, to these desires, but hee resteth himselfe in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and present disposing and dispensing of things, according to his owne will and pleasure. Neither by Spirit here is meant any wicked spirit or Angell, for they doe with feare and horrour expect the same comming of our Lord and Saviour Christ; because his comming shall bee the accomplishment of their miserie and eternall infelicitie. But by Spirit here is meant, the spirit in all the Elect and holy people of God; in whomsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Spirit of God is, that Spirit doth say <hi>come,;</hi> and doth wish the accomplishment of all these most gracious promises. For this is not the desire of the flesh, or of nature; but an earnest and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment desire of the Spirit of God in the Elect, that saith, <hi>come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe secondly, the same verse telleth us, that the <hi>Bride sayth come.</hi> That is, the Church of God in generall, the Catholike Church, the whole Church of God, being now hand-fasted to Christ, and entred into a spirituall contract with him; Shee desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the consumation of the Marriage, the solemniation of the Marriage which is alreadie begun in the contract of it; and not onely every particular member of the Church in whom the Spirit of God is, <hi>saith come;</hi> but the Church of God in generall, the <hi>Bride sayth come,</hi> the whole Church saith <hi>come;</hi> wishing and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the accomplishment of the Marriage which is already begun.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, the same verse telleth us, that as the <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ide</hi> say <hi>come,</hi> so hee that heareth saith <hi>come;</hi> that is, not onely the Church of God that is now present here upon the face of the earth, but the successive parts of the Church in all future Ages; they are all of the same minde, having received the same
<pb n="901" facs="tcp:14764:445"/>
Spirit, they all say <hi>come.</hi> Whosoever heareth this Prophesie, whosoever heareth of these promises in any Age or Countrey of the World, all they having the same spirit, they must needes say <hi>come, hee that heareth, sayth come,</hi> hee that is acquainted with the promises, that commeth to the knowledge of them, and doth min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle them with the faith of his soule, this man must needs say, <hi>come,</hi> to the accomplishment of them.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, <hi>Hee that is a thirst sayth come too;</hi> that is, whosoever hath tasted of the sweetnesse of Christ in any measure whatsoever, and therby hath wrought in him a vehement thirst after more; this man will say, <hi>come.</hi> Whosoever hath such a sence of Christ in his promises, as to taste of the sweetnesse of these never so little; as hee that hath tasted a droppe of honey wisheth for more, so hee that hath tasted of the sweetnesse of Christ, a droppe of his grace and mercie, this setteth upon his spirit a heavenly thirst, he sayth <hi>come,</hi> hee would have more, hee is never quiet till hee have the promise accomplished to him. These are the persons, every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular member of the Church that hath the Spirit; the whole Church in generall, not onely the particular part of the Church now in the World or in any Age, but the severall parts of the Church in severall Ages; whosoever is a thirst, that hath tasted of Christ, must needs say, <hi>come. Even so come Lord Iesus.</hi> These are the persons.</p>
                  <p>The second thing, is the matter of this acclamation of the Church. First the matter contained in it, it is a vehement and earnest desire of the people of God after Christs most happie returne, in these words, <hi>Amen, even so come Lord Iesus.</hi> The matter of it therefore is either infolded and implicite in the word <hi>Amen, even so,</hi> or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded and explicite in the latter words, <hi>come Lord Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is infolded I say in the word <hi>Amen.</hi> This word signifieth in the Scripture, either the Author of the truth himselfe, or else it is an affirmation of the truth.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Revelation, thus sayth the Amen, the faithfull and true wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;</hi> here Christ himselfe is called <hi>Amen,</hi> because he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour <note place="margin">Reve. 3. 14.</note> of all truth and veritie, the faithfull and true witnesse.</p>
                  <p>Sometime this word is used, and most frequently in Scripture, for the affirmation of the truth, either witnessing of the truth, or wishing the truth.</p>
                  <p>For the witnessing of the truth, as in all those vehement spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of our Lord and Saviour Christ, <hi>Amen, Amen, I say unto yee;</hi> or <hi>verily, verily, I say unto yee:</hi> this is a vehement asseveration and a witnessing to the truth, which a man ought to beleeve, or would have to bee beleeved.</p>
                  <p>Or otherwise for a wishing and earnest desiring of the truth to bee accomplished. So in the conclusion of the Lords prayer, and
<pb n="902" facs="tcp:14764:446"/>
all our prayers, we adde this word, <hi>Amen;</hi> that is, <hi>So be it,</hi> or <hi>Let it be so:</hi> we wish it with earnestnesse of affection and desire, and with a confidence and faith of our hearts, wee hope and beleeve that this shall bee so. This is that wee professe when wee say <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this place, this word is used both for affirmation, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing of the truth; and likewise it is a vehement wish and desire of the accomplishment of these promises, with an earnest and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hope and expectation of faith, that all these promises and good things shall bee accomplished to the soule of a Christian.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the matter of this Acclamation is unfolded, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in the latter words, <hi>Come Lord Iesus.</hi> Where there is both the Action, and the Person to be considered.</p>
                  <p>The Action, <hi>Come.</hi> Christ commeth to his Church many wayes. Hee commeth in his Word; Hee commeth in his Spirit; He commeth in his mercies. He commeth in his Judgements and Justice. None of these are here meant.</p>
                  <p>But he commeth to his Church in person and appearance, even in the appearance of his body and humane nature. Thus Christ commeth two wayes to his Church in person. First in his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he appeared to the world in the similitude of sinfull flesh, he came in humilitie, he came to suffer, to die. That is not here ment, for that was past, when as the Evangelist Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote this prophesie.</p>
                  <p>But the Second comming in person of our Lord and Saviour Christ, is his comming in the flesh in glorie, in exaltation to judge the quicke and the dead, to shew himselfe a mightie God from heaven. This is the comming which is here meant, Christs second comming to Judgement in glory. That is the Action.</p>
                  <p>The Person, is described by these two Titles; <hi>Lord: Iesus.</hi> Wherein the Church desireth that he may come both as a <hi>Lord,</hi> and as a <hi>Iesus.</hi> That hee may come as a Lord to vindicate the Church, and revenge him upon his enemies, to destroy the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of darknesse, the kingdome of the Divell, the kingdome of Antichrist, which hath beene a great argument in this booke of the Revelation.</p>
                  <p>And not only come thus as a <hi>Lord,</hi> but as a <hi>Iesus</hi> to save his Church, to vouchsafe to her, comfort and peace, and joy; that he would come to cloath her with immortalitie and glory, which she cannot expect on earth in a mortall state. This is the summe and substance of this Petition and request, that the Lord would come in Majestie and glory, both as as a Lord, against the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church to destroy them utterly: and as a <hi>Saviour,</hi> to bestow upon the Church, even all saving mercies, especially that great mercie of everlasting blessednesse, that is not mixed with
<pb n="903" facs="tcp:14764:446"/>
sinne and corruption, that is not mixed with any infirmitie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect whatsoever. This is the summe and substance of the Text which I have in few words shortly explained to yee.</p>
                  <p>Whence the point I observe (wherein wee will insist by the grace of God at this time) is this.</p>
                  <p>That it is the nature and propertie of every true member of the Church of God, earnestly, and longingly to desire the second comming of Christ for the full redemption of his Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Spirit saith, Come, and the Bride saith, Come; and whosoever heareth saith, Come; whosoever is a thirst saith, Come:</hi> therefore every godly man that hath the Spirit of God, that is a part of this Bride, that is partaker of those promises, that hath a taste of Jesus Christ, every one of these most necessarily say, <hi>Come; Even so, Come Lord Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is so proper to beleevers, and to every one of them, as they are all of them described by this propertie in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Tim. 4. 8. The Crowne which the righteous Iudge shall give mee at that day, and not only to me, but to all them that love his appearing.</hi> The Apostle he might have said to all Saints, and godly whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and to all faithfull beleevers, but he makes choyce of this Epithite, hee describeth them by this, that they are such as love his appearance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heb. 9. 28. Unto them that waite for him shall he appeare the second time for salvation.</hi> The godly are there described by this very propertie, they waite, and long, and desire after his appearance the second time.</p>
                  <p>In the 24. of Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> Gospell; it is made the propertie of a good and faithfull servant there, that he waiteth for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters comming, and prepareth all things in a readinesse, it is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the slothfull servant that doth cleane otherwise.</p>
                  <p>Yee see the truth of it in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>But yee will say; Is this the propertie of the Elect and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? Doe not ungodly men and sinners beleeve the comming of Christ, and that he shall come to judge the quick and dead? Doth not every man make this profession of his faith; <hi>I beleeve that Iesus Christ shall come to judge the quick and the dead?</hi> Why then doe yee make it the propertie of Beleevers, since every man beleeveth and lookes for it?</p>
                  <p>To this I answer. There is a twofold expectation of Christ his returne to Judgement.</p>
                  <p>The one; An expectation with desire, and with an earnest longing, the expectation of the faithfull, of a <hi>Lord,</hi> of a gracious Redeemer, nay, of a loving Husband. Therefore every faithfull soule cannot but waite upon him; As a faithfull servant that hath
<pb n="904" facs="tcp:14764:447"/>
done his worke longeth for his Masters comming home, that hee may give an account of his faithfulnesse, and may bee acceptable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>o his Master for his faithfull service that hee hath done in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, that hee may expect his Masters remuneration.</p>
                  <p>But there is annother expectation of Christ to come, that is not with desire, but with horrour, and dread, and feare, out of guiltinesse of conscience. This is the expectation of a Malefactor in the Jayle, he wayteth and lookes for the comming of the Judge to passe sentence on him, and so to bee dragged to execution; thus wicked men expect Christ, thus wicked Angells expect him. But the expectation of the godly is an expectation with love and desire, an expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not of a severe Judge, but of a loving husband, of a faithfull Master that hath promised a recompense to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of beleevers, even the least and lowest; if it bee the gift of a cup of cold water in his name. Therefore ye must take knowledge of the expectation here meant, This I say is proper to beleevers.</p>
                  <p>Let us see the truth of the Doctrine, in the Reason of it; why every faithfull soule must needs long and desire the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ.</p>
                  <p>First, because it is a part of Christs gracious promise, which the faith of the soule leaneth on. The proper object of faith is the promise of the Gospell, this yee may see in the Text, Christ had promised to come, <hi>Amen, even so;</hi> here is the reason of this desire, because his promise goeth before it. The faithfull soule apprehendeth every other inferiour promise, and every lesse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, much more this maine promise, the very knot of all, the very complement of all: faith must needs expect and claspe fast hold upon this promise, and give assent and acclamation to it, as in the word <hi>Amen, even so come</hi> as thou hast sayd and promised.</p>
                  <p>Many promises to this purpose, hath our Lord and Saviour Christ pronounced, for the stirring up of our faith and affection; as namely that in the 14 of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospell toward the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, where hee comforteth his Disciples in his absence; <hi>If I goe, I will come againe.</hi> And so in <hi>Acts 1. 11. As yee see him ascend with your bodily eyes</hi> in his Person and flesh, <hi>so yee shall see him descend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But wee need not goe far for promises, for immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the words, and two verses besides in this Chapter, the 7. and 12. <hi>Behold, I come shortly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the property of every godly man having the promise of the comming, to leane upon it, and to desire the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the promise. In the old Testament they had the promise of the first comming of Christ, that they earnestly desired; as <hi>Iacob</hi> Gen. 49. <hi>Lord I have wayted for thy salvation,</hi> and <hi>Abraham saw Christs day afarre off, and rejoyced.</hi> And in the New Testament
<pb n="905" facs="tcp:14764:447"/>
wee read of <hi>Anna,</hi> and <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the faithfull <hi>that waited for the consolation of Israel:</hi> they waited for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of this promise, the comming of Christ in the flesh, his first comming. Shall they waite, and earnestly desire the first comming of the Sonne of God in humilitie, and humanitie and basenesse? and shall not we earnestly expect his second comming in glory, to manifest not only his glory, but our glory? shall not wee expect that comming of his, wherein we shall be married to himselfe, and whereby we shall be tooke up to himselfe? Thus yee see the promise of Christ is one ground, yea, and a principall ground of this expectation of the faithfull.</p>
                  <p>The second Reason is drawne from the Union and conjunction betweene Christ and the faithfull soule. That is in the Text too, <hi>the Bride saith, Come.</hi> Now there is a neere union and conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in this same conjunction of Mariage amongst men wherein the love must needs be imperfect, and but a-drop of that Ocean, and wherein the love of the parties must needs be finfull, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding wee see how vehement it is, In the absence of one another; the one longeth and pineth after the other, and one partie enjoyeth not himselfe without the other. Much more ought it to be so here in this heavenly contract betweene Christ and his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Spouse: should not here the Spouse bee <hi>sicke of love?</hi> as the Spouse professeth of her selfe in the second of <hi>Canticles.</hi> This ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement desire must needs arise out of the neerenesse and undevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dednesse of that conjunction that is betweene Christ and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. There is little love, where there is little desire of the thing beloved, when it is absent. Why doth the member of the Bodie, desire immediate conjunction with the head, but because it knows that the separation from the head, is the death of the member? So it is in this neere conjunction betweene Christ the head, and his members the Church, they must needs desire immediate, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable conjunction with the head, because the separation from the head, must be the death of the members. That is the second Reason.</p>
                  <p>The third Reason of the Point is this, because the Saints of God they know that the accomplishment of the full happinesse of the Church of God, and likewise of themselves that are members of the Church, it consisteth in this, in Christ his second comming againe to judgement, therefore they doe earnestly desire it, and affect it, and say, <hi>Amen, even so, Come:</hi> because (I say) they know this is the comming that perfects the Church of God, perfects their glory in the state of happinesse, which the Church and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member thereof doth expect: they know that that is the time which shall be the <hi>Revelation of the sonnes of God,</hi> who are here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, and shall be till that day come. They know well that all
<pb n="906" facs="tcp:14764:448"/>
the graces and perfections that the child of God can attaine to in this imperfection; all is but the first fruits, all is but a tast, and therefore they cannot possibly but lift up their heads, and raise up their hearts to the expectation of that day wherein these first fruits shall bee perfected with <hi>full measure shaken together, and running over;</hi> whereas there shall be an absolute freedome from all sinne, and from all the appurtenances of it: an absolute perfection not of grace only, but of glory, which is the highest grace. They shall be one with the head, this is that which makes them looke for it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. (the place I named before) it is said, <hi>Christ shall appeare to save them that waite for him.</hi> Hee shall bring a full horne of salvation, he shall perfect the salvation of the Saints; till that day there is no perfection in the salvation of the Saints; No, though they goe to heaven, yet before that day there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect salvation, because their bodyes are not joyned to their soules. This is a third Reason, even the expectation of the full accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the promises. The Lord hath dealt with us as he dealt with his own Israel in their wildernesse, he gave them a taste of the fruit of the good land; he caused the searchers to carry some clusters and bunches of the fruit to the Israelites in the Wildernesse, that they tasting of it might hie themselues to that rich and goodly, and fat countrey: so the Lord giveth us some drops of grace, and onely giveth us a taste of that happinesse that wee waite for, that we may hie our selves so much the faster through this wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to enjoy it. This therefore is a strong reason wherefore the people of God must needs say, <hi>Come, Even so, Amen;</hi> let it be so, because (I say) they know till Christ come the second time, they must not expect the accomplishment of their hope, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their happinesse.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and last Reason of this Point may be this, because we are taught by our Lord and Saviour Christ to pray, <hi>Thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come.</hi> That is, not only that the kingdome of grace may come into our hearts while we are here, but that the kingdome of glory may hasten upon us: and we are sure that this Petition shall never be granted to us, till Christ his returne againe to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till he come to accomplish this maine promise of all: for then only Christ commeth as our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Iesus.</hi> Then he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth as a Lord, and makes an end of all the warres of the Church, then he shall throw downe all enemies before him, treading Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and all his instruments under his feet, then he shall manifest to the world that he hath <hi>the Keyes of hell and of de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>th,</hi> then he shall destroy the kingdome of Antichrist, that must be abolished by the brightnesse of his comming. And then, and not till then, he shall come as a Saviour to performe perfect salvation for his Church, to deliver his Church, not only from condemnation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but from the
<pb n="907" facs="tcp:14764:448"/>
molestation of sinne, not only from tyrannie and oppression of enemies, but even from all the presence of enemies, that at that day a separation being made, it may be said to the Saints of God, as <hi>Moses</hi> said to the Israelites when they were afraid of the Egyptians, stand still, <hi>feare nothing the enemies that your eyes have seen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> to day, yee shall never see them more,</hi> they shall be so farre from oppressing the Church, that they shall never molest the Church not so much as by their presence, then hee shall dispose the kingdome to his members, as the Father hath disposed the kingdome to him.</p>
                  <p>These are strong and effectuall reasons to prove this point to us, that the members of the Church, true beleevers cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly but waite and expect, and vehemently desire the comming of Christ the second time, for the salvation of his Body, the finall salvation of his people.</p>
                  <p>Here one objection may be made by the way, and so wee will descend to the Use and Application of it.</p>
                  <p>Here it may be said; But why doe the people of God thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and waite for the comming of Christ, in all the Ages of the New Testament for the space of 1600. yeares, and yet hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not? What reason have they to be commanded to expect and wish, and waite for the comming of Christ, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not in so long a time? Have not all beene frustrate of their expectation? And may not we as well as they that lived in the Ages before us, for wee see no appearance of his comming, no more then was many hundred yeares since?</p>
                  <p>To this we answer; That the patient abiding, and waiting of the just never miscarrieth: the Saints of God never lost nor shall lose for their expecting, and waiting for Christs second comming to Judgement. The Saints of God in former ages 1600. yeares agoe waited for Christ comming; but were they losers by it though he came not? This expectation of his comming, it kept them in the exercise of their faith, of their hope, of their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, of their watchfulnesse, it kept all their graces a working, therefore they were no losers by it, though they had not the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of the maine promise: in expecting the promise, they were savers and no losers, because all their graces were kept in exercise.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, in the second place, the very expectation of Christ in the Ages of the New testament, though he came not, it is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and usefull to draw up the hearts and mindes of the godly to heavenly thoughts, and to a heavenly conversation: and so in the very first Ages of the New Testament, the Apostle tells us that this is the use of their expectation: <hi>Phil. 3. 19. Our conversation i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> in heaven, from whence wee looke for a Saviour:</hi> they looked for a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="908" facs="tcp:14764:449"/>
then, when he was but newly ascended: was it fruitlesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he came not of 1600. yeares after? No, but <hi>Our conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is therefore in heaven, because we waite for his comming.</hi> In all ages since, this expectation hath beene a meanes to raise the heavy mold of earth, the heart of man to heaven and heavenly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: therefore this expectation doth not faile, because it is of use to helpe them to the full fruition of it in the time of it.</p>
                  <p>Besides, the Saints of God never murmure, because Christ commeth not, they never murmure as those that shall lose their hopes and expectation, because they are taught to frame their mindes and wills, to the will of God, and of Jesus Christ their head: Now, the will of God is that wee should still waite, though Christ come not, because hereby the Lord doth glorifie himselfe in the gathering in together, the number of the faithfull. The number of the Saints must be gathered in, and none must be neglected: Now, is there any Saint of God, and beleever in the world that desireth not that every Saint should be gathered in, and the whole body of Christ perfected in the whole members of it, before Christ come to judgement? None must be neglected, and every beleever must frame his will to the will of God; God hath revealed that the number must be gathered in, and when it is so, Christ will come and gather all together under his wing. Now the Saints of God thinke not much that the number should be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in, they are well contented with it. So likewise God hath revealed his will, that though hee be exceeding patient to wicked men, yet he is not forgetfull of his promise; God will bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented though he be provoked every day infinitely by the highest sinnes of the world, patiently to endure all this, and to offer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of peace and mercy, even to the worst, to shew himselfe rich in mercie, and so full of goodnesse, that he makes offer even of goodnesse to the worst. Now the Saints of God here frame their will to Gods, and are content still to waite, because God still put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth his patience, and still offereth Conditions of mercie and peace to those that are wicked, and out of the way, whereby some are converted, and others convinced, and prepared for the worke of Gods justice. So this question need not trouble men, or hold them off from a chearfull, and fruitfull expectation of Christ, though he come not in our age, as he hath not in others before.</p>
                  <p>The use of the Point is this, First, if this bee the propertie of the godly to wait and earnestly to expect the comming of Christ; then wee may observe the generall ungodlinesse of the World, by the generall want of this expectation.</p>
                  <p>And if ye say, but who is there that doth not expect the second comming of Christ? and who doth not beleeve that hee shall come to judge the quicke and the dead?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="909" facs="tcp:14764:449"/>
I answer, not withstanding that every man confesse this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of faith with his mouth, yet every man beleeveth it not with his heart; for every man frameth not himselfe according to the faith of it. Very few are those faithfull servants that waite and prepare for their Masters comming, Christ when hee commeth he shall scarce finde faith on the earth. What a number of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are there, though they heare these things, and they are bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon them upon many occasions, and they are in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments convinced that it must bee so; yet notwithstanding the faith of their hearts apprehend it not, they doe not beleeve it, they doe not listen and frame to it. Wee (like <hi>Caleb)</hi> tell them of the good Land, and the fat of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Land, and the fruit of the Land, and the fulnesse of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but generally men (like the unthankefull <hi>Israelites)</hi> murmure, and repine, and rebell, and scarce heare us; or if they doe, they doe not beleeve it: For if men did beleeve it, it could not bee that men should live like <hi>Saduces</hi> as they doe, that neither beleeve the soule, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie, neither that there are spirits, nor Devills, nor resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, nor nothing: the lives and conversations of men plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bewray that they beleeve not this Doctrine, though they can professe with the mouth, that Jesus Christ shall come againe to judge the quicke and the dead, but like the Cardinall of whom wee read; that profest hee would not give his part in <hi>Paris,</hi> for his part in <hi>Paradise;</hi> so men live as if they would not give their part here on earth, for a Childs part in Heaven. Like that wicked Pope that we read of when he was about to dye; now (sayth he) <hi>I shall know that which I never beleeved, whether there bee a Heaven or Hell, an immortalitie of the soule or no.</hi> So men live as if they never meant to know those things or beleeve them, till they come to the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and experience of them.</p>
                  <p>And besides, what a number of men and women are there that can professe these things with their mouth, but they cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into a fast sleepe in sinne and security, and sleepe on both sides, Gods Messengers and Ministers cannot awake them, but as though their soules were to sleepe everlastingly; so they sleepe on in their lusts and sinnes, and will not bee awakened.</p>
                  <p>And (my brethren) who doth not observe that it is not the fashion of men even of those that professethemselves Christians, to say <hi>come Lord Iesus,</hi> till they bee on their death-beds; and till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>hey bee scarceable to speake or breath out a word; they never say come Lord Jesus, till they know not what to doe with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, till they can enjoy their lusts, and the World, and their sinnes no longer; they cannot tell how to bequeath themselves longer to the service of sinne and unrighteousnesse, till then they never call after the Lord Jesus to come to them: and when they
<pb n="910" facs="tcp:14764:450"/>
doe, it is not out of love and affection to Christ, but out of selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love to helpe them out of the hands of death, that is too strong for them; and to fetch them out of that miserie, they are too weak to sustaine. Therefore they call Lord Jesus, but (as I sayd) it is farre from the love of him in their hearts; for were these men to live over their lives againe, and to bee restored to health againe, it would bee the last breath of their lives still to call the Lord Jesus.</p>
                  <p>My brethren, whre these things are (and wee finde them too generall, every man that lookes into his owne heart, may finde himselfe in some measure touched herein) certainely it cannot bee that this same lively desire of a Christian can bee there, and these persons can have little comfort in themselves, they have few ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove themselves Elect of God, having the Spirit of God, or to bee those that heare the promises with faith, or those that thirst after Christ; there is no argument in them that they are Christs, because they long not and desire after him.</p>
                  <p>But therefore in the second place, since this desire is so rare; let us trie ourselves a little, even those that professe better things, and hope well that they are indeed the Spouse of Christ. Let us trie and search our selves whether this expectation bee with us or no, that wee may finde comfort in our estate, and in our union and conjunction with Christ.</p>
                  <p>For tryall of this Point, first wee must know that a necessary attendant and companion of this expectation of Christ, and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for him; is sighing, and longing, and a vehement desire after him. It is no slight no superficiall desire, but an inward vehement desire, a sighing and panting after Christ, as those that see the need of him. And therefore as the Wise man sayth, <hi>hope deferred, paines the heart:</hi> the godly desires of the <note place="margin">Prov. 13. 22.</note> soule, bring paines to the soule for want of Christ in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christ. And as the Apostle expresseth it in <hi>Rom.</hi> the 8. <hi>Wee sigh in our selves</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>wayting for the redemption of our bodyes.</hi> Wee sigh in our selves, as men that are ficke, or in paine, or opprest with a heavie burthen, sigh out their sorrowes and griefes; so the godly soule must labour to finde this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, in the sighing, longing, earnest desiring after Christ; wee sigh in our selves, sayth the Apostle; this is an argument of true love to Christ indeed, when wee earnestly desire him in his absence. As a true faithfull Spouse enjoyeth not her selfe when she enjoyeth not her Husband; so it is with the Spouse of Christ, therefore the Apostle in the 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 3. joyneth them together, <hi>The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient wayting for of Christ.</hi> As if hee should say, there can bee no love of Christ, if there bee no wayting for
<pb n="911" facs="tcp:14764:450"/>
Christ, and according to the vehemencie of your love, will bee the vehemencie of your sighing and longing after him. That's the first attendant of this expectation whereby we may examine our selves.</p>
                  <p>A second attendant is, a comfortable sweet joy in the soule, a fruit of the spirit, not a fruit of presumption, or of the flesh, but a fruit of the spirit, as the Apostle sayth <hi>Rom. 5. 1. Being justified by faith, wee rejoyce under the hope of the glorie of God:</hi> where there is an earnest and certaine expectation of Christ (faith giving assurance to the soule of Christs returne for the happinesse of it) it rejoyceth under the hope, the heart resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it selfe into joy, because it shall enjoy Christ. That which the Apostle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> sayth, confirmeth this notably, <hi>whom</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> (sayth hee) <hi>having not seene, and yet wee love him, and rejoyce with joy unspeakeable and glorious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doe wee finde this joy in our hearts? this heavenly joy? that which shall bee perfected in the presence and full fruition of Christ? But alas! where shall wee finde this joy in the World? Men joy in Corne, and Wine, and oyle, in the encreasing of their Money, and Stockes, and Estates; where is the joy the heart is resolved into, to consider and remember the returne of Christ to the full and perfect happinesse of the soule? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely (my brethren) this is a rare grace upon the earth; and yet where it is not, that man can have no sound argument in his owne heart, that hee hath this expectation of the comming of Christ, for with it there is a sound joy in the heart that the world breeds not, nor cannot take away.</p>
                  <p>A third companion to trie the truth of this expectation is, an endeavour after puritie of heart and life, this must needes goe with this expectation; 1 <hi>Iohn 3. 3. Hee that hath this hope purgeth himselfe, and is pure as hee is pure:</hi> Hee that hath this hope that expects Christ hopefully and joyfully, hee purgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: hee that wayteth for Christ, wayteth for him that hee may bee like him, that hee may bee holy as Christ is holy, (still reserving the proportion of a member) and bee pure as Christ is pure.</p>
                  <p>What a number bee there, that professe they looke for Christs returne for their finall salvation, and yet this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation doth not purge their hearts, doth not cleanse those nastie and filthie corners that are there. It purgeth not their mouth from falshood, and lying, and deceitfull and cursed speeches, nor their hands from injustice, and oppression, and the like; they are no whit like Christ in their conversation, and yet they hope for and expect Christ, no, hee that hath this hope purgeth himselfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="912" facs="tcp:14764:451"/>
What shall wee thinke of them that oppose, that seeke to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse puritie of heart and life? that cast scornes upon puritie and holinesse? what shall we thinke of these persons? Shall we thinke that they have this expectation? They will tell yee I, and justifie it before any man, and boldly stand upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of their Saviour as well as others: but if thou hate puritie in others, then thou hatest it in thy selfe, and hee that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not himselfe hath not this hope, for he that hath this hope, purgeth himsefe as he is pure.</p>
                  <p>A fourth companion and attendant of this expectation, is Christian fortitude and valour, and unweariednesse in labouring and suffering for Christ. Where this expectation is, the soule is invincible in labouring and sufferings; Hee careth not what he endures, what hee sets on for the name of Christ. This wee shall see in the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when hee had the white in his eye, when hee had this ayme set before him, <hi>the high price of the high calling of GOD in Christ, I forget the things (saith he) that are behind, and presse hard to the things that are before.</hi> Though his labour and paines, and sufferings were marveilous great, he forgetteth all them, and still presseth hard to the marke, the prise of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. So holy <hi>Moses,</hi> because <hi>hee looked for the recompence of the reward, hee chose to suffer</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>affliction with the people of GOD, rather then to enjoy the pleasures of sinne for a season.</hi> Besides, those faithfull servants of GOD, many other instances might bee added, to shew that when a man hath this expectation that Christ will come, and give him the end and recompence of his labour, and eternall joy and glory for his short sufferings, which are not worthy of the glory that shall be revealed, hee refuseth no paines, no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, no passion, no sufferings for Christ and a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But what need we goe further then the example of Christ himselfe, the example of all examples, <hi>who for the joy that was set before him, indured the Crosse, and despised the shame?</hi> and why was this? but for our example, that wee should despise the crosses that are before us, and goe on unweariedly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faintingly through all crosses and persecutions; if wee meete with never so many oppositions, with never so many Diuells, yet to goe chearefully on in the wayes of God, why be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wee have a hope, and an expectation before us of Christ appearing.</p>
                  <p>Further, another attendant of this expectation is this; It blunteth and abateth the fiery edge of our affections to the things of this world. Hee that hath this expectation is weaned from the world, it looseneth the soule from the world every day more then other; Whereas naturally wee are rivetted to
<pb n="913" facs="tcp:14764:451"/>
earthly things fastened to the world; this expectation wrought in the heart, causeth us to walke more loosely and unjoynted, it blunteth and abateth those eager desires that are in us to earthly things. See it in the example of that worthy servant of God <hi>Moses,</hi> because hee looked for a Citie, and for the recompence of reward that was set before him; hee scorned the treasures of Egypt, hee despised them, hee cared not for honour or treasures, or all that Egypt could afford, he had rather suffer afflictions with Gods people, why? because hee looked for the recompence of reward.</p>
                  <p>Bee there not a number of persons that professe they expect Christ his returne for their finall salvation, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they are so fixed to the world; they gather the world as greedily, grapling the things of this life together so earnestly, with such vehement affections, as if they were to live their age over a hundred times? Bee there not a number of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians that professe this hope too, that hold it most unwise and foolish thing in the world to lose any thing for conscience-sake, and for Christ? Alas! these things will not stand with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. When a man hath a good title to heaven, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to part with the broken title to the things of this life: as long indeed as a man hath not a better title, hee will hold to that worse: but when hee hath a blessed title to the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Saints in light, hee careth not for this broken Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and title, hee will not hold them, because they cannot hold him.</p>
                  <p>In the last place, another note that attendeth this expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, where this is, there will bee an answerable affection, there will bee a promoting of all the meanes to further it, there will bee a griefe and sorrow for all things that come against it to hinder it. Thus wee doe in other expectations. When we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect this or that reversion, when any thing commeth betweene our hope, wee grieve for it, any thing that commeth, or falleth out to further our hope, wee rejoyce in it. And thus it will bee likewise in this expectation of Christ, if it bee true, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is that may further our hope, and further Christ his comming, that wee desire and pray for, that wee rejoyce in, that wee promote and put on with all our power and strength; and because a powerfull ministrie of the Word, promoteth the kingdome of Christ, and fetcheth in the company that shall bee saved, and hasteneth his comming; therefore wee will withall our power and strength, hold up the ministrie of the Word of GOD, (that Scepter of Jesus Christ) for the gathering in of people to God, for the perfecting of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Elect, that so Christ may come and finish our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.
<pb n="914" facs="tcp:14764:452"/>
And whatsoever it is that may hasten this his comming and appearing, we are glad to see it in the meanes of it, when the Word is preached, when the Sacraments are administred, when people are gathered to God, when grace appeareth in the hearts and lives of men, when wee see the power of godlinesse manifest it selfe any where, when wee see godly men incouraged and entertained, when wee see the feare of God to prevaile in Families and the like, we rejoyce at this. Why so? because this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth and confirmeth our hope, it gathereth in the number that must be accomplished, before our finall deliverance. And contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, when we see things to impaire, and hinder the comming of the kingdome of Christ, that hinders the salvations of men, when we see the Church of God left without able teachers, and in stead of them, to come in unprofitable and unsufficient ignorant men, when we see the free passage of the Gospell hindered, many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent lights shut under a bushell, and their light hid from the people of God, and the Gospell from the Church of God, when we see faction prevaile, and both Civill and Ecclesiasticall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment despised, when Heresies are countenanced, and the people of God discouraged and disheartened, when we see the state of the Church of God abroad, that many sad blowes are given by the enemies, and the sword of the enemie is sharpe upon the Church, when we see these things, these dazle our hopes, they come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene us and the kingdome, and second comming of Christ, the hastening of it: therefore there must be griefe for it.</p>
                  <p>Thus it will be; We pray for every thing that may hasten it, and pray against every thing that stands betweene, and hinders the conversion of men, and the glory of God, and the proceedings of Christs kingdome: thus (I say) it will be with us.</p>
                  <p>But where is the man that takes these things to heart? who set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himselfe on these holy and conscionable courses? If this be so, it appeareth manifestly, that this expectation, though it be every where exprest, is hard to be found any where; there be very few that beleeve our report, few there be that set themselves to sift and examine the soundnes of their expectation, and desire after Christ, yet where it is not (these attendants) it is not sound and sincere.</p>
                  <p>In a word, to stirre us up to this, as the Church and the Spirit, and the Bride, and he that is athirst here saith <hi>Come,</hi> to stirr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> up (I say) our desires to this, we will use a Motive or two.</p>
                  <p>Doe wee not see by all this discourse a plaine difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene godly men and unbeleevers? A godly man that hath the Spirit of God in him, sayth <hi>come.</hi> A wicked man hath no such spirit in him; with his tongue hee may say <hi>come</hi> sometime when hee is forced, but hee hath not the spirit to say <hi>come.</hi> Here is the difference in their present estate, but afterward the
<pb n="915" facs="tcp:14764:452"/>
difference is greater; when the evill servant will not way<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e for his Masters comming, but sits with the drunken, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines, hee shall bee made a spectacle of his Masters surie; <hi>The Lord of that servant will come in a day when hee looketh not for him, and at an houre when hee is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with unbeleevers.</hi> Ther's then another difference.</p>
                  <p>Againe, consider though the comming of our Lord Christ bee certaine, yet the particular time to our knowledge is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine; but though the particular time bee uncertaine, yet it is hastening, it is not farre off. In the time of the Apostle, there was but an houre, sayth Saint <hi>Iohn now is the last houre:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 45, 46.</note> if it were the last houre in the Apostles time; certainely it is the last minute now, the very last minute of an houre now.</p>
                  <p>And I beseech you, let us consider the promise that is made to persons that expect the comming of Christ, <hi>Blessed is that servant, whom his Master when hee commeth shall finde so doing:</hi> how doing? watching, and preparing, for, and expecting of his Masters comming; <hi>Blessed is the servant that his Master shall finde so doing:</hi> hee speakes there in the singular number, there are not many that hee shall finde so doing; therefore hee speakes of one that is blessed, one of many that shall bee found so doing. <hi>Blessed are they that watch and keepe their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cleane,</hi> that purge themselves as hee is pure, that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to bee holy as hec is holy; blessed is hee that doth so.</p>
                  <p>If it were not for these promises, how were it able for Christians to get over the rubbes and hinderances that lye in the way of this expectation? how were it possible for a Christian to leape over the brunt of reproaches, the execution of sentences, and persecutions that the Saints of God goe under? onely because they have an eye upon this White, the expectation of the comming of Christ.</p>
                  <p>The faithfull Martyrs in this Kingdome, and in other Countreys; what did drive theem to embrace the flames, and the cruellest death and torments that Persecutors could devise? but onely this was in their eye, this bore them out against all the threatenings, and sufferings of the World, this was that that did give them encouragement and comfort above all discouragements.</p>
                  <p>And to conlude, above all let us encourage our selves, by the fruit and recompence of all this expectation; what is that? the Apostle Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> sayth, that when this hope shall come into our hand, when our faith shall meete with fruition, then we shall see Christ so as to bee like him: here is such a sight of Christ, as
<pb n="916" facs="tcp:14764:453"/>
never the eye of flesh saw, nor can see; to see Christ and to bee like him, to see him as hee is; here is such a sight as would ravish us if wee knew what it was, and wee cannot know while wee are on earth; eye hath not seene that which wee shall see in Christ: but when wee shall enjoy this expectation, wee shall see him as hee is, and see him so as to bee like him. <hi>Father</hi> (sayth hee <hi>Iohn 17. 24.) I will that where I am they may bee that they may see my glorie.</hi> Wicked men see his glory, what priviledge then betweene them and the godly? It is true indeed wicked men see the glory of Christs person, and they shall see and feele the glory of his justice; but the godly see the glory not onely of his person, not onely of his justice, but the glory that no wicked man ever shall see, the glorie of his Mercie, and goodnesse, and grace; here is the difference. God getteth himselfe glory upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of him; but God getteth himselfe the glory of his Mercie in Israel, in saving them in the bottome of the Sea: so the godly, they see the glory not onely of the person of Christ (and that is infinite and surpasseth apprehension) but they see the glory of his Mercie of his eternall goodnesse, and they see it so as to bee like him, to be translated into that glory, to get a part and share of it (as much as they are capable of) they make themselves all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious with his glory, and shine with his brightnesse and beauty.</p>
                  <p>Alas brethren, all the sight we can get of Christ in this world, it is like the sight of the blind man that Christ cured, hee bad him looke up, and lift up his eyes, and he saw men walking as trees, an imperfect sight; so wee have here but an imperfect glimpse of Christ, we see him through a glasse, through the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and these meanes that he hath appointed, an imperfect sight, till Christ give us a cleere sight, and makes us see perfectly, and this is in the day of his returne. All the sight and vision of Christ in this life, it is but to see him in a glasse (saith the Apostle) as in a looking-glasse, but then we shall see him face to face, wee shall see him as he is. What difference there is betweene the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in a glasse, and the face it selfe, so much difference there is betweene the sight of Christ here, and hereafter, when we shall see him as he is, when we shall see him with open face, and not in a mirrour. Therefore let this incourage us, and stirre up our hearts, to expect and waite for the comming of Christ with vehement and daily prayers, with ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of spirit, with the Church, and the Bride, and the Spirit to say, <hi>Even so,</hi>
