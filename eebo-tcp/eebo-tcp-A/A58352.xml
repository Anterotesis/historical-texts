         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the
READER.</head>
            <p>IT has not only been the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
but eſteemed a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
in every Age, to aſſiſt
thoſe Theams that have
been run down by a Popular pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
and contempt: Marriage
appear'd ſo to the Author of the
following Paper; which ſuffers too
much in the loſs of its Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Eſteem; had any more
Dexterous, found that Generoſity
about them, as to have perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an act of ſo much Juſtice, they
had prevented this attempt of the
Author, who writes not out of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
nor a buſy humour. But it
<pb facs="tcp:51447:3"/>
ſeemes the wits are revolted, and
have taken imployment under a
Tyrannick, and proſperous vice:
whilſt thoſe who are beſt able to
appear for ſo excellent a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
have deſerted it, the aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of meaner Perſons, though
they may want the applauſes of
Succeſs, yet they loſe not the
Character of Kindneſs. And
when others are ſtrangly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in heaping Reproaches up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Marriage, and in aſcribing
diſadvantages to it, whilſt they
affront it with their new Witt,
and their modiſh Vices, nothing
can appear more Juſt, then to
vindicate it, by Recapitulateing
thoſe benefits that it has produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the world: it is a witneſs
great enough of its misfortunes,
that it needs to be Harangued;
ſince its practicall Eſteem and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
had 'till now preſerved
it from the want of Elogies: but
<pb facs="tcp:51447:3"/>
when it is reduc'd to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
it is high time to erect it
Monuments, whilſt the world is
ſo faſt forgetting its <hi>Reputation</hi>
and its <hi>Grandeur.</hi> But whilſt the
Author has attempted this, he
muſt ſay in his own Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he has only intereſſed
himſelf in the Subject, without
reflecting upon any that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
it injuries: and indeed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Writer, ſhould proclaim like
the <hi>Roman, Pacem cum Hominibus,
Bellum cum vitiis.</hi> 'Tis far from
his humour to ſhow a diſreſpect
of that nature to any Perſon, and
as far from his beleif, that the
way to reclaim others, were to
expoſe them by ſevere Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
they will do him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
who think ſo of him; and
equally traduce him, who ſhould
take his taxing the Crimes of
ſome, for a Cenſure on the whole
Community: he only deſignes to
<pb facs="tcp:51447:4"/>
ſhow the vanity and the fault of
thoſe who becoming enamoured
on a fatall humour, muſt yet
make their addreſſes to it in ſo
ſtrange a manner, as to impoſe it
on the beleif and practices of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and in aſcribing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of the whole Town to
the efforts of a private Humour.
We are well aſſured, that thoſe
vices have found impregnable
more Perſons then they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to have Conquer'd. Though
at the ſame time, ſince all Vice
is progreſſive, and eſpecially when
it is puſht on, by ſo ſtrange a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
and affectation, it is but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to fix ſome Accuſations
on that Practice, whoſe noiſe and
daring temper, may in time, make
more conſiderable devaſtations in
the poſſeſſions of that Vertue,
which yet is left ſecure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted.
And the Author de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
this Declaration not only as
<pb facs="tcp:51447:4"/>
an excuſe for the following Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but alſo as a Juſtification of
what he has formerly written,
in which he finds himſelf cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
as taxing the whole Town
with thoſe blemiſhes, which he
only affixed to the affected and
impoſing humour; though he can
eſteem that reproach as no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then an Evaſion and an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
in the faulty, ſince thoſe
whoſe innocence is aſſured, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
concern themſelves in any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions
which belong not to them.</p>
            <p>—Thus far I had written, when
I received an Anſwer to my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques;</hi>
but it was neither with
<hi>Trouble</hi> nor <hi>Surprize;</hi> ſince I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well know, that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the moſt modeſt Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to defend himſelf from the
preſent briskneſs of the Town
wit: which ſpares neither a Friend
nor an Enemy: the trade of <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
and <hi>Raillery</hi> [muſt] go on,
<pb facs="tcp:51447:5"/>
or elſe all the Town wit [muſt]
be ſtarv'd. I received no diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the leaſt from any thing in his
Book; only his Preface put me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a little heat, in which I [muſt]
tell him, that amongſt all the
bad Company he beleives I have
kept, I yet never met with any
thing ſo diſingenuous and ill-bred
as his odious Epiſtle: and I can
aſſure him, that I have given the
World greater proofs then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of contrary Impreſſions: but
the anger is over, and I am his
moſt Humble Servant; and though
he beleives me to be a <hi>Pedant,</hi> a
<hi>Tutor,</hi> a <hi>Secretary,</hi> and <hi>Squire
Clodpate.</hi> I will yet imagine
him to be a great Wit, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
and if he pleaſes a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Quality: for I alwayes
find it more eaſy, as well as
more civil, to give Elogies, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then reviling: as for his
deſign, it was brave, and not at
<pb facs="tcp:51447:5"/>
all <hi>Dangerous;</hi> for what could he
do leſs, when he was perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
egg'd on by a fair Lady
who was reſolved not to admit
of his Courtſhips, except he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
prodigiouſly Ingenious, as
he is otherwiſe ſweetly accompliſht:
ſhe appearing of a <hi>Capricio,</hi> like
that Princeſs, who would have
refuſed for her Gallant, the
handſomeſt man in <hi>Europe,</hi> if he
had not been alſo at the ſame
time, the greateſt wit of the <hi>Conclave.</hi>
I congratulate you Madam, in
the choice you have made, of a
Servant; he has acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
well of your Lady-ſhips Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
and I hope, when you
have any others, you will not
beſtow them elſe where: but
yet if at any time, you ſhould
requeſt him to write your Life,
let me beſeech you, to forbid
him to put an Epiſtle before it,
for he has the worſt faculty that
<pb facs="tcp:51447:6"/>
way, of any Gentleman I know
All that I ſhall ſay to his Book;
is, that it is throughout one great
miſtake; and that firſt, in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe Reflexions to be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for all the Town, which were
only directed to a very few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
And then to affirm that
the words of <hi>Age, Nation, Town,
Societies,</hi> &amp;c. were General, ſince
it is ſo plainly to be ſeen, by
the <hi>Cenſure,</hi> and the <hi>Character,</hi> that
none but a foole would have treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them in that manner: an Age,
a Nation, a Town, in which are
ſo much Learning, Bravery, and
Vertue; and particularly, thoſe
Societies that are by all the
world honoured and revered, for
thoſe endowments the Gentleman
has mentioned in them. All that
I proſecuted was a vain and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizing
humour, which hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(upon occaſions apparent)
found amongſt ſome of the Wits;
<pb facs="tcp:51447:6"/>
I after followed where it had
took refuge in graver Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the former received the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearch,
like thoſe who are juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eſteemed the greateſt Wits
of our Nation: but amongſt the
latter, it met with the <hi>Haloo,</hi>
and the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
this it is to have any thing
to do with thoſe Gentlemen, for
my part I diſclaim them, and
ſhall hereafter be as unwilling to
Note their Imperfections, as I
have ever been to admire their
ſort of Vertue. Another great
miſtake is, that I deſigned Sir, <hi>T.
L.</hi> for a <hi>Hero:</hi> what was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in him, was only to ſhow
that a Gentleman who had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at all the perfections of a
good Education, might live more
prudently on his Eſtate in the
Countrey, then to ſpend it in the
Town, only on women, Playes,
Garniture, and Fricacies: and
<pb facs="tcp:51447:7"/>
this Gentleman knowes (who
muſt be a man of the Law by
his frequent Quotations.) That
his Majeſties Father of Glorious
Memory, Commanded by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
all Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to reſide on their Eſtates, and
not to come to the Town, to
<hi>Hero-fie</hi> in eating of <hi>Ragoo</hi>'s, and
<hi>Fricacies:</hi> and in ſhort, next to
thoſe whoſe affairs lye in it, it
is properly a place for younger
Brothers, who may raiſe their
Fortunes, by Armes, Letters, or
Converſations. I think I have
in theſe few lines, anſwered all that
the Gentleman has Objected.
There is only a great deal of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſment,
Reviling, hard Words
if not Pedantry too, behind: for
which I ſhall ſay in the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
behalf, that as for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
he endeavour'd to imitate
the preſent mode of Writing, and
he does excellently well for a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner,
<pb facs="tcp:51447:7"/>
and he may eaſily be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
if he has reach'd but few
of thoſe perfections required in
that criticall Stile: and as for
the latter, having to do with a
<hi>Pedant,</hi> and a <hi>Tutor,</hi> he could not
but forget that Civility and Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
which without doubt, is
(otherwiſe) naturall to him: and
he thought it needleſs, to uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Lawes (which he found
not in his ſtudy) of <hi>Writeing-Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carade;</hi>
ſince he thought himſelf
not at all obliged to ſhow any
reſpect to one in a <hi>Vizzard.</hi> But
I reſolve, for my own part, to
be more carefull, and wiſh hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
his friendſhip and reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and if the Gentleman,
who has ſucceeded ſo well in
Letters, ſhould alſo make his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plycations
to Armes, if Sir, <hi>T.
L.</hi> and his Tutor, meet him in
the ſpring, on board his Majeſties
Fleet. I know that Perſon, will
<pb facs="tcp:51447:8"/>
endeavour a friendſhip betwixt
this worthy Gentleman, and his
Mothers Secretary: but I would
not willingly defer it ſo long;
but rather perfect now ſo Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
an affair. Come Sir, you
are out of humour; I wiſh we
might injoy you a little in our
Country; where you ſhould have
good entertainment, though you
might not meet <hi>Aſtraea</hi> there,
(whoſe alluſion you ſo unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
miſtook) my Lady will treat
you with extraordinary Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
and her Secretary ſhall
ſerve you with great officiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
you ſhall Drink, Hunt,
Hawke, Courſe, nay you ſhall
ſtay on <hi>Sunday,</hi> and hear our

though poſſible he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Preach ſo Divinly as <hi>Maximin.</hi>
I have now done with the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
I have only a word to ſay to
the Town, and particularly the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive
<pb facs="tcp:51447:8"/>
Ladyes; as for any
thing in the Remarques, I do
affirm on the reputation (with
my Anſwerers good leave I
would ſay it) of a Gentleman,
that I never intended it in the
leaſt, to impair the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of excellent Perſons; or
the Converſations of the Town:
and I hope no other will
be guilty of ſo unkind a
miſtake, as to think I meant
Age, Nation, and Town,
any otherwiſe, then as they
are frequently applyed to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
humours: Nay I will
ſay further to prevent any
other Eſſayes; that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques</hi>
was in a manner
Printed againſt my deſire,
(though I will not accuſe
a Gentleman who had eat,
and drank, and ſlept in an
Inns of Court.) And beſides,
that there are ſome things in
<pb facs="tcp:51447:9"/>
it which were not my own.
I know there is no Perſon
of Juſtice and good Nature,
but will be ſatisfied with this
Apology: and as for others,
I am wholly careleſs of their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>

            <p>NOthing is more juſt then the Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
this following Paper to you:
neither could any conſideration oblige
me to forbear it: and even whilſt it
ſeeks a ſhade, it yet deſires ſo illuſtrious
a patronage. What ever cenſure it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
in the world, will ſoon be forgot
in the kindneſs you will ſhew it; and the
favour of ſo excellent a Perſon, will
ſufficiently reinforce it againſt all the
aſſaults of cuſtome and prejudice. And
in the privacies where we now are, I
may aſſume the liberty to ſay, we are the
votaries of the neglected Theme; and
acknowledge the Divinity of that Altar
which the Irreligion of the Age has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned:
all our regret is the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
we have found in making that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb facs="tcp:51447:10"/>
which is now eſteemed the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Devotion of the World. Though
Vertue has loſt its Traine, yet it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the most obſequious reſpect from
us; and it has not been our hearts but
our conditions, that have refuſed its
conduct in the track of Ages. We are
not yet become Atheists to a <hi>Hymen,</hi>
nor deſerters of a fidelity which is loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with reproaches: Neither do we
recount theſe things in a ſhade, becauſe
we bluſh to avow them in the Sun beams.
No <hi>Antonia,</hi> we have depoſited thoſe
reſolutions in faithful aſſurances, which
we would at any time be willing to lay
out for ſo fair a purchaſe: in which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
we have preſerved our Vertue, like
ſnow, that's in cold houſes ſaved from
the Estive ſeaſons of a rageing vice:
the age has no propitious ſentiments
from us, nor do we valew the reproach of
being ſingular in our vertue, the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Idea's,</hi> though the world may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
they are faded, are yet more char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to us, then the gayneſs of their
<pb facs="tcp:51447:10"/>
preſent Images: All their Paint and
imbelliſhments cannot enamour us on
theſe; nor has the dirt they have
flung upon the former, prevented us
from admiring an unequall'd beauty
in them. We have given them the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant
of our ſoules; and they have
faſhion'd there that fidelity and juſtice,
which will be for ever the ornament of
our breaſts: neither do thoſe qualities
appear leſs fair and agreeable to us,
whilſt their habilements are out of mode.
Now the popular fury and practiſe has
proſcribed a vertuous love, it receives
a protection in our hearts; and we can
boaſt, that it ſhall never be refin'd but
with our lives: we are ſorry to give
it no larger a Territory; and we
would gladly lead it farther into the
affairs of our lives: we are not ſtopped
in th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe deſignes by the Platonick pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution,
nor a fear to try our Idaeas by
action: we have took other meaſures of
a juſt and happy life: and prefer the
example of generous Ages, before the
<pb facs="tcp:51447:11"/>
fictions of Romance: tis not becauſe we
love their beautifull wanderings, that
we are kept in a perplexing Labyrinth,
and know not how to come at what we
love; Since it is not our humours, but
our affairs, conceale the Clue. In the
mean time, our inclinations and our
wiſhes will appear a juſtice to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;
and a reſpect to the memory of
our Fathers: Nay, we rather ſee our
ſelves deprived of ſome of the felicities,
then cut off from the generuos inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
of that State: we have erected vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Altars to <hi>Hymen;</hi> and pay the
more diſintereſted part of the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
our Piety has nothing in it of
Mercenary, whilſt the mind is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Devote. We have ſurpaſſed the
Poetick Chymaera<hi>'s,</hi> by a truth that has
out done their Fables; and yet that
paſſion which has equal'd their flights,
ſhall ever keep it ſelf above thoſe loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
places where they reſt their Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius:
it is not grown giddy by the
height; nor will its flight ever become
<pb facs="tcp:51447:11"/>
the Paecipice of its ruine. No <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia,</hi>
we have alwayes maintained the
limits of Fidelity, and Iuſtice; nor can
we ever allow our love that fatal Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty,
as to be above the Laws of our
Vertue. We have ſeen too much of their
misfortune, who aſſiſt a Tyrannick
Paſſion; whilſt they unhappily help it to
acquire, a Felicity and Grandeur, to
which it mounts on the ruines of their
Repoſe and Honour: in our united
hearts our Love has room enough to reign;
and the management of thoſe juſt affairs
will allow it no leiſure for Ambition. I
have entertained you <hi>Antonia,</hi> in a
manner unuſual: but it cannot appear
unhandſome to the Age, ſince it is
but to imitate their divertiſments in
Maſcarade. And to the reſt, it will
only ſhow a covetouſneſs like to
theirs, who hoarded under ground
their Treaſures; eſteeming that
to be yet their VVealth, which
they did not dare to own. And
we have moreover, exceeded their
<pb facs="tcp:51447:12"/>
felicity; who have on wounded
Trees, or Marble, ſaught an
immortality for their Love: ſince we
have now committed ours to more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
abiding Letters; and though we
have ſet it in a ſhade, and a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
unknown, yet we will expect that
propitious time, that ſhall both reveal,
and interpret it.</p>

that when we

have demanded thoſe
things from me in earneſt,
which were then our diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſment:
but ſince you have
been ſo inclined, I obey you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51447:13"/>
readily, both, as I ſhould
bluſh to refuſe any ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to a Perſon who has ſo
grandly obliged me; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
as I have a repugnance to
quit my declared opinions.
But, I hope you conſider,
that you deſire theſe things
from a young man, who is
uncapable of doing right to
ſo great, and ſo important
a Subject; and one, who
beſides, can furniſh the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with no experiences
of his own; and moreover,
the diſtreſſes of that Theam,
require the aſſiſtances of the
moſt dext'rous and generous
Pen, whilſt it lyes bleeding
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51447:13"/>
in the armes of a barbarous
Age; who perfectly forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the reſpect it has receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from all Generations;
and the brave aſſiſtances it
gives to humane nature; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the particular
obligations it has laid on
themſelves, are upon the
point of finniſhing its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the world, without
the leaſt ceremony or ſhew
of regret. Such a Proſpect,
requires the aſſiſtances of the
nobleſt Pen, which can do
no leſs then purchaſe to the
owner the immortal fame
of a Hero; ſince Marriage
is not now aſſaulted from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51447:14"/>
the Ambuſhes of <hi>Cloysters;</hi>
nor from a luſtful Fryer;
But by the faireſt preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to generoſity and noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
whoſe Protection have
in all Ages been ſought by
thoſe diſtreſſed Intereſts,
which have fled from the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Pedants.</hi> Whilſt I thus
repreſent to you the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of this Action, I ſhew
you my inability to do it.
But, ſince it is for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of a Friend, I think
your Ingenuity and candour
are too great, to expect a
ſufficiency from a man he has
not about him. Neither,
can I believe, that you want
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51447:14"/>
any Motives to aſſiſt you in
your juſt reſolutions; that
condition appearing too
lovely in it ſelf, to want the
imbelliſhments of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence:
beſides the glories
of the object you careſs,
whoſe perfections and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments
are ſo great,
as hardly to be equalled
within the compaſs of our
Iſle. And were there not as
much of pride as inclination
in the preſent humours, we
might very well queſtion
whether the moſt hardy of
our Gallants, did they eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day converſs with thoſe
beautiful endowments which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51447:15"/>
She poſſeſſes would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
deſpiſe the glory of con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>temning
Marriage for ſuch an
injoyment, and even be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to be vertuous, rather
then not be happy: this we
have reaſon to believe would
be their reſolution, were
they not ſtrictly tyed up to
the high Rules of their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and Glory; ſtarving
their judgements, whilſt
they feed their pride and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation.
Your deſign wants
none of the following Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to juſtify it, nor to
keep your reaſon from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to the fantaſtical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions

And I muſt reminde you of
one thing more; which is,
that as in Pictures, ſo in
ſuch conſiderable draughts
of humane Intereſts and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
there muſt ſtill be
wanting thoſe graces and that
lovelyneſs, which no Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription
nor Account can
reach; it being impoſſible
for the glorious life to be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valled
by the ſweeteſt Paint;
and we can only lay the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and a ſimetry of parts,
whilſt the beauty and the
charm are above the reach of
Pens. It will yet be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
to keep your thoughts
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51447:16"/>
together, to purſue a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
and to decline the
hunting-mode of writing
now in uſe, of running Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques
here and there, as
the fancy of the Author
leads him: Marriage is our
Theam; and the juſtneſs,
neceſſity, and advantages of
it, the Subjects to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
into. It is now the
opinion of thoſe which will
pretend to underſtand moſt,
That the world has been
fool'd in nothing more, then
in an idle and a tame ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the fetters of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
that ſome one, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to them, did moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51447:16"/>
inſlave ſo many
Generations with this dull
inſtitution; which did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that account, loſe the
freedome and the vigour of
generous actions, and miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in thoſe Eſſayes, that
would have ſhewed a greater
bravery and glory of Minde.
All Ages being left ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
draughts of Haeroick
vertue, becauſe the Genius
was captived that drew them,
which if it had known a juſt
liberty, former Generations
would have been as perfect
as the preſent is like to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
They think that if
ſuch a company of Hero's,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51447:17"/>
had been born into theſe
parts of the world, who had
been free of this Clog, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
had never ſat ſo long
ſlumbring with its Arms a
croſs, whilſt the <hi>Turk</hi> plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it of its beautifull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;
but that its Moones
had been Eclipſed by thoſe,
who with the quickneſs of
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> had ranged the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Regions of the Eaſt;
carrying their victories ſo
farr upon the Traverſe till
they had found no day light
to conquor by: but the
World has wanted theſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
flights, whilſt it has
been the impediments of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51447:17"/>
Wedlock, that made it ſit
ſo long ingloriouſly ſtill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and to paint the Scenes of its
adventures with ſo much
imperfection and dulneſs.
But when we ſhall find that
the world has received not
greater benefits by the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
of Liberty, then from
the votaryes of Wedlock;
and when it will appear that
nothing is more juſt to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
then that condition,
we ſhall be able to return ſo
criminable a Charge. Thoſe
Ages defind more prudently,
and with greater moderation,
who made not bravery of
minde a Knight errant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51447:18"/>
ſubmitting to all the
riſques of Fancy and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite;
the world has ſuffer'd
by nothing more then in this
uſeleſs noiſe, nor could
there have been an act of
greater prudence, then to
put the ſhackles on this mad
and wild Liberty, which
would more then any other
thing, have diſordered hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Affairs. True noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and glory, is regular and
managed; and not like that
Goddeſs born on the brain:
an infinite number of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
and publique kindneſſes,
ſate long in Counſell how to
define it; nor have they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51447:18"/>
its Character without
many correctings and emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations;
they have drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
different perfections;
and then tryed them all (like
<hi>Emmas</hi> Purgation) by the
vigour of humane affaires,
our Anceſtours conferred
not their favours ſo readily,
nor did they admit thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the family of Hero's, who
were conſiderable only, for
a peculiar wildneſs and fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy
of minde: the preſent
managers of Genius's, may
try their off-ſpring by their
Poetick fire, but they ought
not to do that injuſtice to
their Fathers, as to affirm
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51447:19"/>
they adored no other light.
They have introduced <hi>Chymae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>
then, and have exploded ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Realities, who have
diſlodged braveries of Minde
from the circles of Marriage;
and with them they have rob'd
the world of great advantages;
of which I ſhall give you a
proſpect in this following Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
To oblige mankind,
by an obligation ſacred, and
unalter'd, to the affairs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
of one Love, was an
act of that prudence and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
againſt which none can
juſtly diſpute: They could
with no equity, have raiſed a
Title to more; ſince the Law
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51447:19"/>
of nature proclaims that <hi>[Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one ſhould be for one enough]</hi>
and that Sex muſt have been
left in a condition wholly baſe
and mercenary, to have took
the pay of every Amour; they
would have ſet up a Tyranny
in Love, which muſt have been
the moſt cruel and inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of all others, becauſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
on the beſt intereſts of
Life. Marriage puts the
world into Diſcipline, and a
happy government; incloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the common injoyment,
that none might lay claim to
the portion of an other: had
beauty, and the poſſeſſion of
that Sex, been left a prey to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51447:20"/>
the Conquerour, and ſubject
to be borne away by the moſt
forceible courtſhips, mankind
muſt have ever dwelt jealous of
each other, proclaiming an
enmity againſt all the World;
and have judged their power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
a ſufficient defence: but
by the fore of matrimoniall
Laws, and the allotments
made us from above, we live in
quiet and ſecurity with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who muſt elſe have ſtood
perpetually on our guard, and
ſecured what we had loved
from the wandering Luſts of
others, the world muſt have
been perpetually involved in
Quarrels; ſince Love is more
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51447:20"/>
reſtleſs, and more impatient
then Ambition: and whilſt a
charming object had many
claimers, ſhe muſt at laſt have
yeilded to the Conquerour;
and not have gratified the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the moſt deſerving, but
the moſt happy, being without
the exerciſe of that Empire
which Halcion Lawes had gave
her, that muſt have been whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
loſt amidſt the animoſities
of Rivals. Or if mankind
had been wearyed into a more
Friendly way of living, and
yeilded that to indifference,
which they pretend would have
been the effect of Saciety: yet
ſtill the world muſt have loſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51447:21"/>
its Glory to preſerve its Peace:
and like thoſe deſpiſed Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who are therefore quiet
becauſe they banniſh all things
that would invite a Conqueſt.
The uſe of excellent things
muſt have been laid aſide, and
the World muſt have practiſed
the wiſdome of a prudent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort,
who disbands her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to cure the jealouſies of a
Husband. And as the great
<hi>Cato</hi> urged the preſerving of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> to keep up the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of the Roman vertue
which would languiſh when it
had nothing to emulate; ſo
ſuch an indifference, muſt have
yeilded up all things of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51447:21"/>
concernment. Moſt
actions of bravery and glory,
receive a motive and originall
from without; and as we have
ſeen, that all Ages have
applyed themſelves to thoſe
things that procured the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem
and the reward, Vertue
preſently fading, when it wants
the Sun-ſhine of applauſe and
emulation, and the ſhowers of
recompence: ſo no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of particular concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Love, and the ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of appearing gratefull and
accepted, had brought a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
dulneſs on the world, then a
preſent reflexion can readily
diſcover, neither ſhall we affirm
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51447:22"/>
a thing at all unjuſt, to ſay,
that the world owes not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
benefits to a vertuous
Love; and that, not ſo much
as it has brought upon its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
ſo many Hero's, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
as it made vigorous and
ſtrong the beginning of that
vertue, which had poſſible ſat
down wearied with ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements,
had it not been
ſupported by a generous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
a truth that has found
more excellent experiments,
then what are met with in foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Romances. And whilſt
thus the exceſſes, and the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
had done the world e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
prejudices, what could
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51447:22"/>
be more propitious to it, then
the moderation and the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
way of Marriage? it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
on one hand what is
violent, furious and Rapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and overcomes on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a  degenerate indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and ſloath: and as it is
not our inclinations but their
irregularity that makes our
Crime, ſo every thing is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in its moderation: thus
the aſſiſtances of fire to the
occaſions of life are very
happy and neceſſary, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dreadfull when it growes
unruly; we ſaile with pleaſure
on that Ocean, and trace its
yeilding boſome with remoteſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51447:23"/>
wealth, from which yet we fear
an inundation. So Love pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in happy bounds by the
inſtitutions of Marriage; its
excellencies and advantages
remain to the world, its chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh
and troubleſome qualities
are cut off by Lawes: <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>its made
tame and gentle, which would
elſe have devoured the faireſt
concernments of the Univerſe:
ſhould the world be without the
ſociety of this govern'd Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it might want a heate to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gourate,
and render ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
all its parts, which muſt
elſe have ſubmitted to dull lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhments,
nothing then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
more juſt then Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51447:23"/>
ſince the love it cuts off
and regulates, the world could
not have borne; and the love
it manages it cannot ſpare,
without parting with the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of its beſt Affairs: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have any appeared diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with this conduct, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Bravo's, and Furioſo's
of Ages, who think that the
ſatisfying of an ungovern'd
appetite, is more important,
then the being kind and oblieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to common nature; whilſt
only ſuch politiques as their
own, can make it be thought

of the whole, for the unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

The higheſt wiſdome
took the proſpect of all the

with no Juſtice, reproach the
prudence that governed their
Fathers; with which they are
diſpleaſed, through the capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs
of their own folly, and
not the defect of the precept;
which like Beds and Couches,
are not to be accuſed, becauſe
they are uneaſie to the Sick and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51447:24"/>
diſtempered. We have found
how prejudiciall the ſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
they have made of
their new way, has been to the
world; they have practiſed on
it but a little while, but yet,
like bold Empericks, they
have ſo altered and ſpoyl'd its
conſtitution, that a long courſe
of better experiments will
hardly recover it; they have
boaſted of their Skill and Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity,
but thoſe inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
that they pretended ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
to remove, they have
opened into an impetuous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of peccant Humours; and
had not former times who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the intereſts of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51447:25"/>
done more then they for
the proſperity and good of the
world, it had poſſible known
ſcantier Allowances of health
and tranquility: had the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
of the Univerſs been
faſhioned by them, we might
hardly have ſeen produced all
thoſe monuments of Vertue,
Glory and Nobleneſs, which
now are extant in thoſe who
are like to do nothing but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
their humour and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
and quarrel with thoſe
things they cannot minde: and
the world ought to look upon
them as no other, but ſuch who
in Countries lying low, let in
the Sea upon them, to drown
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51447:25"/>
all the poſſeſſions of greateſt
Value; thinking ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy
ſufficiently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced,
by having thereby an
opportunity, to row the ſmall
Pinaces of their fancyes,
trimmed with the Flag and
Saile of their Poetry, over the
buryed magnificencies and
honours of their Fathers.</p>
            <p>Marriage laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and firſt principle of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Society; it was a Yoake
for which the neck of innocence
was not too ſoft and delicate;
and a condition governed by
unerring vertue, had yet need
of theſe allotments, as to the
advantages and improvements
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51447:26"/>
of Society. And that which
Marriage appropriated, was
the firſt proclaiming of <hi>Mine</hi>
and <hi>Thine;</hi> the Earth was
common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the injoyments
of it had an undiſtinguiſhed
right, whilſt the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Bed were ſacred
and ſeperate: and even in
thoſe natures, the moſt ruined
and decayed, there are yet
the remaines of this old incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which ſhew themſelves
in jealouſies, and a deſire to
poſſeſs alone the fancyed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
and in all things elſe
we can allow a ſharer, but
in the intereſts of our Love:
conqueſt, repine, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51447:26"/>
divided the portions of
the Earth, but nature ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Marriage; againſt
which it is the higheſt crime to
complain of ſo juſt an inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
and of ſuch equal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances.
That condition
through the Ages it has tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
has often met with thoſe
rudeneſſes and unkindneſſes,
as have made it ſuffer, and loſt
its reſpect, but if mankind
would reaſſume that obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
and obſervance which
it ought to receive, we ſhould
find it again reſtored to all its
former renown and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
that Inſtitution, like
Power, owes its glory to the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51447:27"/>
reſpect is paid it, whilſt every
thing that is neglected, is by
that ſcorn rendered cheap and
contemptible; and any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem
which Marriage lyes
under, is not from the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
that are found in
it, but only ariſes from the
incivility of thoſe times that
forbear to reſpect it: if ſome
Perſons would ſtuddy to do
it Juſtice, we ſhould find it
again with the ſame votaryes
about it, and not like dethron'd
Monarchs, without its ſtate
and unattended. Some not
generous as they ought, have
put affronts upon Marriage,
and a deſire of their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51447:27"/>
have produced in others
the fellowſhip of their crime;
ſcrupling not at all to ſhare in
their Vices, ſo they might
but participate of their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
theſe are the Factions ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
againſt Marriage, who
loſeth the memory of their
Fathers, that minded nobler
things, can think of nothing
better then the moſt diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
and diſhonourable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſments.
But I believe,
I have ſaid enough to vindicate
the juſtneſs of Marriage; and
there is that in every mans
mind that will aſſiſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour.</p>
            <p>As the principle which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51447:28"/>
continues nature, is of all
things the moſt excellent and
generous, ſo that which makes
the continuance happy and
advantagious, muſt not be
contemptible: the ſeeds of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in other Creatures are as
powerfull, as <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Tygers,</hi>
who leave their young to inherit
their quitted beings, and the
Deſarts where they govern'd:
The <hi>Stag</hi> communicates to his
Off-ſpring, his ſwiftneſs, and
a long life, but the Rational
beings, are not only continued
in their kind, but in their
uſe and glory by the diſciplin
of Marriage: and it has not
only perpetuated Generations,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51447:28"/>
and the variety of Ages, but
conveyed along with ſucceſſion
the pleaſures and the intereſts
of it; it has not only laid the
foundations of vaſt and puiſſant
Empires, of leſſer Signories
and States; but rendered
them uſefull, civil, and
excellent, it has given births
to ſuccesfull and flouriſhing
Arts; and not only fixed
their conſtellations, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
pointed the circles where
they ſhed their Influence, it
has managed the high-Mettle,
and feirceneſs of Witt, and
made that eaſy to be governed,
which might elſe have proved
too unruly for them that uſed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51447:29"/>
it. To this we owe the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and excellency of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which has taught wiſdom
and civility to barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
whoſe wilder influence,
like that of Comet, had
pointed nothing but ruine and
diſorders to the world, had it
not roſe in the circles of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
He was once rocked
in the Cradle, whoſe Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
and Science, after tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
to the confines of night
and day; who riſeing in the
ſphear of Marriage, ſhed a
quiet influence, over all that
Land and Water knew. An
indulgent Mother in her lap,
firſt bound the tender head of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51447:29"/>
a famous Conquerour, who
after wore the Laurels of ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
many victoryes, conveying
with her milk and her careſſes,
a ſweetneſs that charmed the
fury of his blood. Whilſt
Ambition, Warr, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers
ſtill emptyed the world,
Marriage ſupplyed it with
other inhabitants, who took
up, through the track of the
ſame Education, the affairs
and intereſts of their Fathers.
VVhen by the death of ſome
excellent Perſon, mankind
have been deprived of great
advantages and bleſſings, ſome
others have roſe up, and equal'd
if not excell'd the vertue of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51447:30"/>
their Fathers. When Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
have been widdowed and
drooped over the loſs of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indulgent
Prince, they have
had reſtored in a ſucceſſour,
the freſhneſs of their wither'd
joyes: and the deſignes of a
vaſt Empire, left in an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
draught, has been fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
by the ſucceeding
hand with all the beauties and
imbelliſhments of Power.
An increaſing Nation, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too ſtraight in narrow
Regions, have under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of ſome Hero, ſought
more commodious places,
whoes generous deſignes have
been ſo farr perfected by his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51447:30"/>
ſucceſſours, as to become one
of the faireſt Empires of the
world: and it has been found,
that mingling Nations, whoſe
Lines have been perplexed
with other communions, have
never done any thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to be renown'd: thoſe
places that have ſuffered incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
where they have not
bravely diſtinguiſhed and
united their own blood, have
preſently loſt the ſence and
name of glory; which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
title of blood, has been the
great motive to the moſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
atcheivements; how
did the world behold and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
an invincible obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51447:31"/>
in the reſolutions of the
<hi>Capuan,</hi> becauſe he could
not betray the glory of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
the reſpect and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of blood, is preſerved no
where but in the Channels of
Marriage; and the Child
only reveres the vertue of a
juſt Parent. The ſence of
glory, not bounded in thoſe
ſacred Spheares, had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
till it had ſpent its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
and fallen ſhot upon
the Earth. Marriage holds
the <hi>Idaea</hi> neerer, and inbelliſht
with that ſence which makes
it ſacred; Emulation ſees
it a far off, and viewes it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with indifference, to which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51447:31"/>
the inclination is but fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
and uncertain; but we
carry it in our boſome, when
we have received it from our
Fathers.</p>
            <p>He that looks upon the
four great Empires of the
World, will find that they
flouriſhed then with greateſt
bravery, when they were moſt
vertuous, and that their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſs
declined with their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals:
the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire
was ſucceeded by the <hi>Perſian;</hi>
which by its ſtrange Luxuries
and Effeminacies, became
ſo eaſy, a Prey to the armes of
<hi>Alexander,</hi> and by effeminate
Ages, are no where meant
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51447:32"/>
the Uxorious, for they were
ever manly and gallant, but
thoſe that gave themſelves up
to the diſhonours of that Sex,
when the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire was
deſtroyed, he that put out its
light, was too careleſs of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
his own; whoſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
and a bold ſpirit, being
all that was remarkable in
him, found not in his Riot
and his Wantonneſs, the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to think of continuing
what he had acquired; by
which meanes that Power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
left without an Heir, but
what was ſuſpitious, and not
reſpected by himſelf, the
violence of its after Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrators,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51447:32"/>
ſoon laid it low;
who ſhareing of their Maſters
temper, as they did of his
Succeſſes, were only the
purſuers of a mad glory; few
of them leaving a name in
Power, who had yet the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
to have done ſo much
to acquire it. After this
roſe the <hi>Roman,</hi> the beſt built,
and ſupported, and of the
largeſt extent: ſpreading the
wings of its dreadfull <hi>Eagles</hi>
over the face of the whole
Earth, being the nobleſt and
moſt exact draught of Power,
that the memory of Man has
known: its vertue was the
moſt uſefull and generous;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51447:33"/>
its Arts the moſt pleaſing and
excellent, and its Spirit the
moſt perſevering and great,
that any times have ſhown,
that were barely Vertuous,
with its religious Reſpect
amongſt other things, to
Marriage, and by the gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of its Morals, it ſtood in
a long ſucceſſion, at once
the terror and the delight of
the world: all Nations, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
courting its friendſhip,
or trembling at its Armes,
but when it was governed by
ſuch Princes as <hi>Nero,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula,</hi>
it yeilded to thoſe
Vices from which it could
never recover it ſelf; but by
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51447:33"/>
little and little declined, till
that greatneſs on which the
world had waited, and which
it had ſerved, laid it ſelf down
ingloriouſly in the languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
armes of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> where
it remains, with none of its
mighty Qualities about it;
and though in the times of
<hi>Silla,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> it ſuffered
much by Ambition, yet it
had then ſtill a remedy to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
the diſeaſe; and whilſt
its peace was boldly aſſaulted
by one Hero, it was as bravely
defended by another: by which
is eaſily raiſed a confutation of
their vain opinion, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſoftneſs and effeminacy
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51447:34"/>
to be the great ſecurity of
a Nations Peace, ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can more diſcourage
the attempts of the moſt skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vertue, againſt the p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ace
of Kingdomes, then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions
which it makes upon
the vigour of thoſe <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
qualities. So <hi>Alexander</hi> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
of <hi>Perſia,</hi> whilſt the
Rhodian liv'd, neither has
any Nation aſſiſted an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
perfection to its own loſs,
ſince though ſome of it may be
imployed ungratefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, yet it alwaies at the

            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:51447:34"/>
If we ſhould quit this great
Ocean, we have traced, and
take a view of all the leſſer
Currents of dominion, that
have run through every Age,
we ſhall find that Marriage
was the Fountain from whence
flowed that Vertue, which
was aſſiſting and propitious to
them. But we will leave that
ſtream, and open a proſpect
into the affairs of Learning,
which as it has roſe in times
ſerious and modeſt, ſo it did
only receive reſpect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
from thoſe ages:
Philoſophers governed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiques
in <hi>Greece,</hi> but they
loſt not only their raputation,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51447:35"/>
but their blood in the effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
dayes of <hi>Nero.</hi> Sciences
never took birth but in grave
and prudent times, whilſt the
ſcurrilous and wanton wit,
was ever eſteemed in idle
Ages. In thoſe dayes, Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and the looſeneſs of the
Theater, the debauches, and
the excrements of Wit, were
only valued and admired; and
they received Elogies and
Laurels, who invented new
wayes of Debauchment, or
that could expreſs themſelves
with the greateſt ſmartneſs
on Letchery and Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance:
VVit and Beauty,
have ever ſhared one Fare in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51447:35"/>
the world; when they are
happily eſpouſed to noble
and illuſtrious Subjects; or
elſe given up to proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and diſhonour; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have the luſtfull Ages of
the world dealt more barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
with that bluſhing
Sex, then with this virgin
quality: and in how many
productions tranſmitted from
ſeveral times, ſhall we ſee the
moſt excellent and vigorous
fancyes, proſtituted to the
moſt baſe and deteſted Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
which infelicity they
received from thoſe times in
which they lived, and they
might have been more happy,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51447:36"/>
had they converſed with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
Theams. Thus the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Learning, and
excellent Arts have fell and
declined for want of Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
whilſt all applyed
themſelves to thoſe things
that procured the fame and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,
nothing is ſince the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of nature ſo pernicious
and extravagant as VVit;
neither has any thing done the
world greater miſchief then
that quality: it has put Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
into flames, fil'd with
wounds the boſome of the
Church; whether it has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided
in Camps, managed
deſignes in Courts; or hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51447:36"/>
errous in low-rooft-<hi>Cloyſters:</hi>
in all which places, the
world has felt the ſmart of its
cruelty: it has ſomtimes ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd
by boyſterous and bloody
actions; at others by ſoftneſs
and flatteries: it has wound
it ſelf into all Intereſts and
Affairs; and when it is not
permitted to inſult, to brave
it, and to manage important
concernments; it conceales
it ſelf, by a peculiar ſubtilty
and baſhfulneſs, from whence
unſuſpected it ruines and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours:
but this quality,
thus pernicious and unruly,
becomes much more ſober and
uſefull in the temperaments
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51447:37"/>
of Marriage. And that
which they call the dulling of
the fancy, and the checking
of the happy vigour, is but a
caſheiring of that madneſs,
which all Ages have been bound
to curſe. VVhen the world
was buſied in matrimoniall
Concernments, Learning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
it ſelf in all the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
of a happy Knowledge;
ſpreading to Heaven its Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and through Earth its
Roots: the eaſy and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
VVit, was put out of
countenance by the gravity
of that appearance, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
willingly to more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
affairs, to gain eſteem
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51447:37"/>
and reputation. Some men
might have the fame of greater
Learning, but the Oracle
pronounced <hi>Socrates</hi> the wiſeſt
Man of <hi>Greece.</hi> And to come
neerer our to times, where ſhall
we find in any ages, ſo much
ſottiſhneſs and a dark igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
as in thoſe, that firſt
a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lowed the ſolitary lives of
Preiſts, in which they gave a
Proofe not of their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
but their vices. Thoſe
dareing men, who with their
inhumane Decrees, control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the influences of Nature;
and could at their pleaſure
ſtem the Rapid Humidity:
which dull Subjects of their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51447:38"/>
bold experiments, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited
in <hi>Cloysters,</hi> thoſe
<hi>Stoves</hi> (too many of them) of
wretched Luſts; which by
the practices of beaſtly Crimes,
appeared no other then the
<hi>Jaques</hi> of the world. In thoſe
Ages the Sun of Learning
ſuddenly clapt in, and that
duller day oppeared little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then a night of knowing
nothing; whilſt the world
ſeemed led by idle Phantaſmes
and fooliſh Illuſions; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
dreames full of unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Aenigma's, before the
ſentiments of waking ages.
Thoſe who were not ſerious were
mad and unruly, thoſe whoſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51447:38"/>
intereſts it was to appear ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn,
were dull and blockiſh;
as if with the opinion, they had
loſt the learning of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours;
and juſtly were
thoſe times infatuated, that
gave ſo great a wound to the
nobleſt affairs of Nature:
neither could ſo bold an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
have dared to appear
in times leſs dark and ſooty.
So that Learning ſeems only
to have loved the ſociety of
Uxorious and modeſt ages,
and to have received increaſe
and favour from them.</p>
            <p>Marriage was moreover a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell
of the after governments
of the VVorld: the dominion
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51447:39"/>
of a Parent in his Family, is
a true repreſentation of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of a juſt Prince,
who is the father of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
men in this mirrour might
have ſeen the agreeableneſs
of Power and Empire; and
with better inclinations might
become obedient to an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
head, whilſt they plainly
could perceive the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of order and ſubjection in
particular Families: had there
been no diſtinction in Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
in which by the reſpect
and obedience paid to ſome
Perſons, the advantages of
Rule might be approved,
men would never have been
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51447:39"/>
willing to have parted with the
moſt extravagant parts of their
Liberty, but all deſires of
Soveraignty would have been
oppoſed as Injuſtice and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny;
but by Marriage, and
the iſſue of the Bed, men had
within themſelves a Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and Dominion, and the
advantages of that evidently
appearing, the intention of
ſome excellent Perſon, and
his deſires to protect Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
and Provinces, and to
be their univerſal Head and
Parent, was not received with
that averſion, as they muſt have
been, had they wanted thoſe
advantagious Preſidents: and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51447:40"/>
I know not how to believe,
that all the Dominions of the
Earth were founded in abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Tyranny: and that they
had at firſt no deſign of the
good of Nations, which was
accidentall, and found neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for the ſecurity and quiet
of Power; ſince it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for any Country to injoy
Peace, Riches, or Profit,
without the ſuperiority of
ſome or other. Marriage
drew the Idaea of Power, and
imbelliſhed it with thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
that made it more
pleaſant to mankind, then
had it been the rough draught
of command, laid only in black
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51447:40"/>
and bloody Colours: with
what abhorrance had they
took the proſpect of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
if they had only ſeen it
deſign'd by ambition, with
all the furies of Death and
Battles; with a ſullen and
imperious look, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
about it propitious and
affable, but ravenous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious:
but in the frame of
Wedlock, it appears friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and obligeing, reconcileing
the thoughts of ſubjection,
whilſt it flouriſhes in all the
ſweetneſs of ſecurity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
It repreſents to us, that
the thoughtfulneſs and the cares
of Rule, are not in themſelves
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51447:41"/>
ſo excellent as the repoſe and
pleaſures of obedience, and
he which injoyes his benefits
ſecured to him, has rather what
he ſhould acknowledge with
gratitude, then emulate in
the induſtry and cares of his
Governour; who though he
weares more ſplendid Titles,
yet his watchings and his
thoughtfulneſs, cover with
paleneſs the tempting beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the other; none would
deſire to rule, that ſee the
Luxuries of Power cut off
by Lawes, and preſidid over
by the wakeing deſigns for the
common good: and like the
Children of a Family, they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51447:41"/>
willingly allow the Parent his
command, whilſt they receive
a maintenance and protection.
In ſhor<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, it affords to mankind
a convincing Proofe, that
command and ſubjection are
diſpoſitions that may dwell
together with great friendly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and advantage; and that
the world could not tell how to
be without their mingling In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts;
except not only all
reſpect and decorum was
thrown out of it, but alſo, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing of profit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and the thirſt of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

            <p>Neither has Marriage been
leſs propitious to Kingdomes
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51447:42"/>
in particular, then to the

Whilſt it brought in the

a contented condition of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
who if he ſhould obey
the force of no other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
yet the juſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Family and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
would diſpoſe him to
peace and ſubjection: many
men are ſometimes tempted to
be the inſtruments of fatall
diſorders to a Nation; whilſt
they have nothing to ſuffer
but themſelves in the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51447:42"/>
of ill ſucceſs: few are ſo
brutiſh, as to have no regard to
the wellfare of thoſe they love;
who would by Treaſon cut
from his Children a brave Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
and leave them nothing
but Poverty and the reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of his Crime to inherit:
and we find that thoſe who have

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51447:43"/>
have upon our minds: 'tis
providing for thoſe that come
after us, which makes us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious,
and ſomtimes peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and vertuous too; what
man would not be ſhook, and
feel ſome remorſe in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fignes
and projects of Ruine,
that has a loving Wife leaning
on his boſome, and innocent
Children hanging about his

what deſign ſoever he drives
at, he receives none of theſe
Regrets and Remorſes, but
ſetting all things in himſelf,
cryes, let the world ſtand and
fall with me, and we have
good reaſon to believe, that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51447:43"/>
the unmarried lives of the
Romiſh Prieſts, have been
the cauſes of great calamities
and diſorders in Kingdomes,
who are entertain'd in all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals
of that nature, like the
<hi>Jewes</hi> in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Councels,
for the peculiar averſion which
they bear to the tranquility of
Nations. Men who have
too much leiſure, and too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
dependance on a common
intereſt, will freely play a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their own ſhare in any
Kingdome, by its ruine, whilſt
there are ſo many <hi>Cloysters</hi> in

them: which appear the

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51447:44"/>
their <hi>Guardians</hi> and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors
flinging about thoſe kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
fire-Brands, to inflame
the world, who if they had a
Family, and an intereſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
to mind, would with leſs
facility be diſpoſed to act the
Papall deſigns; and would
take a great deal leſs pleaſure
in the diſorders of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Marriage makes men
look upon the peace and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity
of the world with more
concernment and delight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then
thoſe do who care only for

a diſpoſition of unreſt in the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51447:44"/>
ſingle life; and whilſt the

are ever feeting and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant:
and the wo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the moſt unquiet and

men dwelling in a perpetuall

not how elſe to imploy their lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
curſed from above, as
lazy and unworthy, but by
intangling and perplexing
the affairs of the Earth: from
theſe diſguized men, have
Empires felt Convulſions
and dolefull Changes, which
like fire diſguized in Snow,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51447:45"/>
inſenſible deſtroyed their
peace; whilſt the veneration
of their diſſembled Sanctity
protected them from the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
of ſuch devouring Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
Marriage made men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
on the buſineſs of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and endeavour to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
that tranquility and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
which a juſt Government
affords them; becauſe they
may by thoſe advantages injoy
the contentments and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
of their families. But
the ſingle life, is uſually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to innovations and ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Power; becauſe that
variety whilſt it pleaſes, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
injures none of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51447:45"/>
bound up in a ſingle
Perſon: they may defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the wound aimed
at a ſolitary breaſt, who could
not ſo well protect the boſome
of many; which under the
conduct of a juſt care, and
affection, would partake of
an equal tenderneſs. Whilſt
War deſplayes its bloody En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fignes
to trembling Regions,
whilſt it covers with the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces</hi>
of many deaths the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome

Scenes are preſented to
the tender and affectionate,
who whilſt they are immortal
in their own reſolutions, yet
dye often for their relations in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51447:46"/>
cruel apprehenſions; and
dread the roling Torrent, as
bringing ſo unuſual &amp; ſo unkind
a fate, in the loſing of more
lives then one; whilſt they
indure a death, muſt be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
by ſence. And for the

which are union of mindes the
Uxorious man oppoſes er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
with the greateſt force,

becauſe though he

thoſe cruel opinions, that

            <p>It afforded moreover to
mankind, the honour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of a hopefull Iſſue: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

more an honour then many
Children, the iſſue of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Bed: the promiſing youth
of a Child, returns a reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Father; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men had been forgotten in
the Hiſtories of Ages, had
they not been the Parents of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51447:47"/>
Children, who were famous;
every Parent receives an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
from the Vertues, and
the celebrated qualities of his
off-ſpring; tis a reputation
to have been the roote that bare
thoſe Flowers, whoſe fairneſs
and ſweetneſs were pleaſant
to the whole World: and if
one Age like an unkind ſpring
has but weakly aſſiſted the
births of a Family, poſſible the
next, has recompenced the
defect by a double propitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
cauſing that Race to be
renown'd in the following Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,
that was not valued
in the former, whilſt all thoſe
Honours and Applauſes, are
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51447:47"/>
not beſtowed without a juſt
Reflexion on the Parent that
bare them: neither is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
any thing inferior, if
the excellent endowments of a
Stranger are pleaſing to us, (as
they doubtleſs are to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
mind) what muſt be
the accompliſhments of them,
whom we have brought into
the world our ſelves? to be the
Parents of thoſe that may prove
ſuccesfull inſtruments for the
good of Mankind, are bleſſings
and contentments, not to be
equalled by little things: and
the actions of many men that
have lived in the world, would
have none of the Reputation
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51447:48"/>
they have yet acquired, if it
had not been for the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of their Families:
next to thoſe intereſts which
we owe above, nothing is ſo
noble, ſo good, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
as to proſecute in
wayes of Juſtice and Honour,
the intereſts of our Family:
in the purſuit of which has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
been raiſed, all or moſt of
the glorious Triumphs of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
Courage and Induſtry
that the world has known;
at leaſt they have on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
received a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and valued name then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Intereſts could have
given them; and who only for
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51447:48"/>
the flaſhes of a ſhort fame,
would with the hazzard of his
own life, have alter'd the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Kingdomes, have
added remote as well as neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Provinces to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
of his Throne; who would
have expoſed himſelf to the
various accidents of the Deep,
and have ſought unknown
Treaſures in Countries bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
unconquered and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traverſed,
if he had not hoped
to have left them as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
of his Family? and
thus on Death-beds, have
great, as well as ſerious men,
left ſuch excellent inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to their Children of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51447:49"/>
up the honour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of their Names, as if the
intereſt they ſhould take in
it remain'd beyond the Grave:
<hi>Agrippina</hi> doted ſo much on
the Imperial dignity of her
Son <hi>Nero,</hi> as to cry out, <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidat
modo imperet:</hi> let Me Dye
ſo He may Reign. Neither
have thoſe who by raſhneſs and
ambition, fell into calamity,
received more mournful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,
then what they
took from a reflexion on their
Families. And nothing is
more remarkable, then that
Tragedy, which the wretched
Gameſter acted on himſelf; to
which he was tranſported by the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51447:49"/>
torment of ſuch Reflexions.
Who ſees not with an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
pleaſure, his name ſpread
and flouriſh in a vertuous
off-ſpring, errected there
by living Monuments to ſerve
the immortality of Ages,
whilſt others have vainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
it, in actions of their
valour; or in magnificent
Graves: the firſt ſlumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the imbelliſhments of
Hiſtory, where it is only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired;
the other is ſomtimes
reſorted to by the curious
Wanderer, who obſerves the
workmanſhip without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
concern'd for the
ſhaded Aſhes: the noble
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51447:50"/>
               <hi>Greek,</hi> who wanting Iſſue,
was forced to adopt his
Victories, to perpetuate
his Name, knew well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough,
that they were a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
and diſtreſſed off-ſpring,
and which muſt be forced to
live on the benevolence of
<hi>Pedants,</hi> and the charity of
Ages: whilſt a Son might
have maintained through ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
that glory in the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
of generous actions,
which was forced to retire to a
ſhade. Neither do they
urge any thing important,
who object the miſcarriage
of ſome mens Iſſue, ſince that
is a precaution not at all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51447:50"/>
in the concernments
of the world: and never to
attempt for fear of a miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
is a diſtruſt only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
with the ignoble: if
at any time the glory of a
Race may be under a cloud
for one Generation, it may
yet in the next ſhine out with
a charming luſtre and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
That Parent is juſt
and wiſe, who leaves the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and Providence to
faſhion the increaſe; and he
takes the conduct from a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hand, who is unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
fearful of the Events to
come: neither would any
truly ſtudious of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51447:51"/>
of Nature, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of an off-ſpring,
impede both, by ſuch vain
fears. Who neglects the
rich Voyages of the <hi>Indias,</hi>
becauſe ſome have ſuffered
Ship-wrackes? neither do
any decline to reap Laurels
in the Field, becauſe they
grow with Cypreſs. To be
guided by the preſent juſt and
pleaſing inclination, and to
leave the ſucceſs to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
above us, is the only
management can give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
&amp; pleaſure to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
men. Children are the moſt
excellent way of pertuateing
our memory, and to afford
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51447:51"/>
us the delight of ſeeing our
ſelves preſerved from a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
forgetfull, and we may
well ſubmit to the ſatisfaction
of ſuch thoughts, without
troubling our ſelves with fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
miſcarriages.</p>
            <p>Marriage does alſo perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
the memory and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of vertue. It is true it
ſomtimes happens that a Son
is not only unlike his Father,
but ſo different, as to be a
ſhame and reproach to his
memory; but yet uſually,
the great qualities of the
Parent live in the Children,
having the advantages of
their examples and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51447:52"/>
and at leaſt, if their
vertue is much the weaker,
yet ſupported by the Fathers
memory, it becomes ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſefull beloved and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the world: the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of ſome Men, who have
been the Authors of great
benefits and good offices to
Kingdomes, have ſerved ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
happy occaſions in the
world, who yet have had no
great Merit of their own to
boaſt off: nothing is ſo much
idolized, nor reſpected by
the generality of People as a
mighty Name; and a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
poſſible in it ſelf much
the greater, found in a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51447:52"/>
not famous, cannot yet
do thoſe things which the bare
reputation of ſome others is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to perform: In the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Wars of <hi>France,</hi> the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a Prince of the Blood,
could eaſily huſh thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions,
&amp; produce that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Diſcipline, which
all the courage, arts and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
of inferior Captains
could never do. He that
erects triumphs of Glory and
Honour, does not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhrine
himſelf where he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored,
but ſets his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in a ſacred place: and with
his only Name, appeaſes the
mutinyes of Armies, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51447:53"/>
in Courts, and
keeps the affairs of the
world in order. How had
the world ſuffered, if a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
who by many generous
actions became the darling
of Mankind, neglecting to
tranſmit a Copy, from ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
&amp; glorious an Original,
had ſet at once, in his Being,
&amp; his Race. In antient Wars,
Infants have been carryed to
incourage Battles, thereby,
with their unactive blood
ſtrangly animateing the veins
of others. And it has more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
been found to work
much upon the diſpoſition
of humane nature, a kind of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51447:53"/>
gallant affection, for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of ſome glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
left to the guidance of a
tender hand: ſuch <hi>Efforts</hi>
ſerved the Race of the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
and the <hi>Gothick</hi> Hero:
procuring to the world this,
believe and benefit together,
that he which leaves his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
an <hi>Orphan,</hi> may have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
for it, the Hoſpitals
of ſtately Tombs, and the
Panegyricks of Hiſtory;
but he that would have it
laſting and uſefull, as well as
admired muſt leave it to his
Iſſue, where in the active
Torrent of generous perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
it may accumulate,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51447:54"/>
the ſame glory and eſteem it
found in the dayes of an <hi>Anceſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi>
to be only admired is a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
advantage, to be uſeful
and to be beloved, is what the
truly noble rather covet:
which is found in the vertues
and good offices of our Race.</p>
            <p>Marriage did alſo inlarge
the Sphear, and eſtabliſh
occaſions of practical Vertue.
He that is marryed has more
campaſs, and a larger field of
Action: he uſually procures
more benefits to the world,
at leaſt more ſubſtantial
and better grounded; he
that is alone lives to this age,
but he that is marryed (by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51447:54"/>
the force of imbraces cauſes)
lives to thoſe Generations
which ſtand next, the worlds
laſt Calenture and burning
fit. <hi>Pompey</hi> did not only
fight himſelf for the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Rome,</hi> 'till he was its
greateſt and mighty Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
but left alſo thoſe gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Sons, who bravely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to revive it when
faint and dying. The pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
vertues that belong to
this life, as they are more,
ſo they are more conſiderable
in the marryed State; Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
how ever pleaſing
to ſome tempers, yet if it be
not altogether Divine, is a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51447:55"/>
thing of little advantage;
eſpecially to the world, and
that is the meaſure of every
excellent quality, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the generall world:
infinite thinking, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
no other advantage
but the private ſatisfaction
of him that is buſied in it,
is but an ingenious ſort of
idleneſs; and moreover,
the miſchief the world has
received by thoſe ſtrange o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
invented by men
who injoyed a perpetual
Vacation from affairs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
too great a reproach
of idle Speculation: the
thoughts of men are perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51447:55"/>
working, and wanting
the entertainments of good
and uſeful objects, purſue
pleaſant and agreeable Idaeas,
that were never yet alter'd
by action; and which are
equally unprofitable to
themſelves and others. But
he that has the intereſts of
a Family, to mind, and
more ſubſtantial concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
then a name, which
like the <hi>Camelion,</hi> lives on
Air, bounds with thoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
limits the extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of his fancy. And the
things he has to manage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in moſt particulars of the
beſt vertue, &amp; the moſt practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51447:56"/>
advantages that are found
in humane Society. How
many glorious actions, and
inſtances of bravery of mind,
have took their Original
from the calamities of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
or the diſtreſſes of a
Child; &amp; without doubt, the
world had wanted the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of its illuſtrious Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of vertue, had not the
affections and tenderneſſes
of theſe Relations, been the
Motives and powerfull In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements
to them: many
indeed, (but unjuſtly) cry
out of Marriage, as a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of care and perplexities,
and celebrate ſingle living,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51447:56"/>
for its freedom and repoſe:
but firſt, let us ask them,
who ever found in a mortal
State, that tranquility they
have pretended to admire:
perplexities and troubles
have as well invaded the
ſhades of the moſt quiet Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
as the affairs and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities
of Families: and who
can ſhew us that condition
of life under the Sun, that
is even and undiſturbed?
If Marriage has caresit has no
more then other conditions;
Nay poſſibly they are more
ſupportable in the gravity
and charm of thoſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
then where they aſſault
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51447:57"/>
mad and wild humour,
weary of every thing. But
then let us tell them, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
that it has advantages,
bleſſings, and ſocieties that
they have not attained: if
they can ſhew us the life of
ſome rude Philoſopher, who
in his retirements from the
World, boaſted of quiet and
repoſe, (though that has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
not Gallantry, but
Sullenneſs in him) we can
ſhew them many examples of
glorious men, living not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contentedly, but admired
and beloved in the tyes of
Matrimony, ſpreading their
uſeful qualities over the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51447:57"/>
Univerſe; whilſt the <hi>Stoick</hi>
has permitted his vertue to
droop and wither, in the
ſhade of his own humour:
beſides difficult and hard ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements
are the triumphs
of vertue, that mind ſhines
with no Luſtreat all, which
has not been brightned with
difficult affairs, owing (as
the Body) its vigour and
ſtrength to motion and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
Moreover, the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
is the ſweeteſt that is
purchaſed with the moſt
induſtry; the ambitious
looks on thoſe acquirments
with contempt which are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
got, and loves the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51447:58"/>
ſteps, becauſe it is the
hardeſt coming there. And
ſuch Motives have we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from above, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
advantages to the
world, that nothing reliſhes
better to the mind; nor is
received with greater eſteem
and applauſe, then difficult
Services: the <hi>Romans</hi> ever
loaded thoſe with Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs,
at their return
home, and erected them Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
who had ſerved the
Common-wealth in the
greateſt dangers and toyles:
ſo that to ſpeak ill of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
only out of a humour
of repoſe and ſluggiſhneſs,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51447:58"/>
is to own the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and ſcandall in the
world. When they paſſed
by the houſe of that great <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator,</hi>
who retired from the
gallant affairs of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
and ſpent his time in a
dreaming idleneſs, they uſe
to ſay, here <hi>Vatia</hi> lyes bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whom have all Ages al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
for Heros? whom
have they <hi>Deified</hi> and ſerv'd
with Altars? not the lazy
and the ſpeculative, not the
boyſterous and injurious,
but thoſe who applyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to court humane Race
with kindneſſes and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits:
and they have met
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51447:59"/>
with the moſt laviſh Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
and Praiſes, who were
the moſt laviſh of their Blood
and Abilities to oblige
the world. Now he that
acts with the multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Inſtruments, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of effecting more, then he
that contrives one end; how
great ſoever the ſufficiency
of one man may be, yet he
ſhines but with a ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Vertue, without the
erradiations of an off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring:
Neither has the
Coate of Nobleneſs been
perfectly blazon'd, but
with our Iſſue.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:51447:59"/>
            <pb facs="tcp:51447:60"/>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:51447:60"/>
An excellent perſon may do
much for the world with his
own ſufficiency, but he doubly
obliges it, who in a Seminary
of Heroes, is continually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious
to it; &amp; then as for the
particular Exerciſes of virtue
in that condition, we ſhall find
them no where to have ſuch
powerful Motives: For whom
was reſerved the Conqueſt of
<hi>Latium,</hi> and the foundations
of an Empire, which <hi>Phoenix</hi>
like, roſe richer from the Aſhes
of <hi>Ilium,</hi> but for that <hi>Aeneas,</hi>
who with ſo exemplary a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
bore his Father through
the Flames; by which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
more Renown'd, then
<hi>Hector</hi> that defended, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51447:61"/>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> that aſſented <hi>Troy.
Rome</hi> once owed its being
and its ſafety, to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and perſwaſions of a
Mother, and that <hi>Hero</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from his duty a tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of mind, hard to be
found in ſucceſſes, and at the
head of Armies: Neither
could the preſent Conqueſt
and Revenge, have ſo much
ſerved the glory of <hi>Coriola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
as that famous Act of his
duty; nothing is ſo noble
as the pity which preſides
on the power to ruine, and
<hi>Rome</hi> had doubtleſs wanted
its effects, had it not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
by a revered Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51447:61"/>
The <hi>Barbarian</hi>
though no death unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
but accompanied with
the aſſaſſination of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and he could ſupport
without regret the company
of his own fate, who would
willingly have fled from that
of his Relation. If the
Poets have not framed artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Scene of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Corinthian,</hi> ſhe owed all
thoſe charming Actions they
have celebrated, to the Idea's
of her duty; neither was her
Rival defective in the beauty
and life of thoſe performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but only by the want
of the aſcendant: And there
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51447:62"/>
are infinite other Inſtances
in the occurrencies of Ages
that acknowledge particular
Obligations to the Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Relations.</p>
            <p>It did moreover aſſiſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
with a mind vigorous,
and conſtant in its Circles.
Virtue loſes its luſtre and
ſtrength, when it is obliged
to wander in various enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments;
Marriage gives
the thoughts a Home, and
an Imployment, that would
elſe be traverſing the ends of
the Earth. Neither ſhall we
find any men of a more man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Gallantry, nor a nobleneſs
all of a piece, as amongſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51447:62"/>
thoſe who have been happy
in this Relation, and great
Lovers of the Intereſts of it:
Some men may have exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in politick Arts, and in
the Stratagems of Conqueſt;
but I very much queſtion,
whether ever any Age (in
the Heathen world) brought
forth any thing more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
or more beloved, then
the virtue of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and
<hi>Brutus;</hi> men not only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly
prizing the Married
ſtate, but ſuch as were bleſſed
with the Society of thoſe
women, that for the returns
of love and kindneſs were
famous in every Generation.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51447:63"/>
We chooſe Friendſhip, as a
Field for virtue to reap ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
in, and none but
retired and trecherous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
will be without the
bleſſings of that; but beyond
all queſtion, that Friendſhip
is the nobleſt, bound in the
ſureſt Ligaments, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates
more the receſſes of
the Heart, that is commenced
in Marriage, then any took
up on other Scores: Some
are pleaſed to cry down
that Sex, as fooliſh and unfit
for the converſation of men;
but they ſeem in that too
much to overvalue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and to ſet ſtrange
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51447:63"/>
prizes on their own worth:
what if there are not ſound
women, whoſe heads are
filled with the crabbed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Philoſophy, who
have no great inſight into
inſignificant and unſociable
Arts, the knowledge of
theſe things could conſtitute
nothing but barren and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
friendſhips; that which
is more generous, more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
and uſeful, is as well to
be found in that Sex, as in
our own; who that is wiſe,
expects in this Relation, a
jumping of Knowledge and
Capacities, or an agreement
with all our Chimera's and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51447:64"/>
Punctilio's, is ſhe unfit for

particular Gallantries of
thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies, they

Standard, who mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the fitneſs of that Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by ſuch an odd agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs:
Humane Race is to
be ſupported and rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
happy by a ſubſtantial
virtue, and not by little Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilios
and affectations; It
has been ſuch Whimſeys that
have loſt the excellent affairs
of the world, and men placing
their contentments in ſuch
idle likeneſſes, have negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
to purſue what were the
moſt, uſeful concernements
of humane Life. Nature
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51447:65"/>
has ſet out the meaſure by
which that Sex is found fit
for our Society, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of ſomething more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
then the pleaſing of
our vain humours: the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
of the world were at
firſt common, and men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the good of the
whole; but the envy, the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priciouſneſs
and ſullenneſs
of after-times, made infinite
incloſures, and men laid out
all that ſtock on the little
portions of their ſa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y, which
ſhould have been imployed
in the publick Banke of the
Univerſe: And whilſt they
have pretended to refine hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51447:65"/>
Society; They have
made its profitable Affairs
evaporate into nothing;
neither have they left any
thing of thoſe grave and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Intereſts; but ſome
wild and thin Idea's, which
they have in ſport, hunted
through the barren Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Philoſophy, and along
the fairy Traverſes of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>Marriage has alſo appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
excellent for the educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Mankind, which was
the next thing important to
his being; without that, as
his Affairs now ſtand, he had
come into the world an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51447:66"/>
abhorring Laws,
and the Regularities of
Society, and his Reaſon riſing
at an Age after his mind
had been rude and barbarous
for want of diſcipline, it
would not eaſily have been
able to ſubdue the wildneſs
of his youth: Nay, all its
performances, had been but
ill and imperfect Draughts,
whilſt it wanted compleated
Images and Idea's to draw
by, its natural propenſities
would have deſigned ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but the world
cou'd never have known
what to have called it; but
Marriage has been in all
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51447:66"/>
Ages the Repoſitory of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and excellent Idea's: in
its School, they are not only
taught but revered; heat is
learned modeſty, reſpect and
ſubjection, affectation and
ſtubbornneſs are betimes
caſhiered, the fleeting and
inconſtant fancy directed
to an aim, and kept ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
by a peculiar authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
Marriage is the Garden
where the Flowers of Youth
are preſerved in their freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and vigour, whereas the
open diſcipline of the world
is like the rudeneſs of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart,
where they grow wild,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51447:67"/>
and neglected, the ſenſe of
ſhame, and the fear of vice
are preſerved under this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement,
and influenced
from this lower Sphear,
whilſt the general defection
had made them difficult to
be ſeen above; but beſides,
this condition has laid an
Obligation on the Parent, to
look after the Education of
his Children; and if there
had not been ſuch an inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in which, it was both
our duty and our reputation
too to look after our Iſſue,
the Children of many had
been neglected, and periſhed
without a name, or any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
acquirements; but
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51447:67"/>
now, thoſe perſons who
have ſtrangely overcome, and
worn out the impreſſion of
what they owe to God, and
their own affections are yet
ſo careful of their reputation,
and the eſteem of their
Race, as to Educate their
Children in thoſe ways by
which they may be capable
of ſerving the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and live with credit;
had not Marriage been inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
when the luſtful youth
had ſatisfied his appetite, 'tis
likely he would have aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
the wretched Mother
with her Infant, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumers
of various ſorrows,
and the Children of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51447:68"/>
great and the Noble, had
been Rocked in Cottages,
and all their dayes followed
the Plough; but now there
are ſacred Channels cut, in
which one ſtream of peculiar
and diſtinguiſhed Blood,
perpetually runs from one
Generation to another; and
we find, that even the moſt
extravagant and voluptuous,
are yet careful of that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
uſing all the induſtry
imaginable to make it noble
and imbeliſhed; thinking it
not enough to continue their
greatneſs, but their virtues
alſo; They endeavour to
faſhion and to ſweeten
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51447:68"/>
youth, that it may be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and accompliſhed, when
it comes to be opened in the
Affairs of the world, to
this purpoſe are the ſeverity
of Chaſtiſements, the variety
of Inſtructions, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
of differing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples;
not only thoſe that
have rendred virtue fair and
agreeable; but ſuch alſo
that ſhew a loathſomneſs, a
degeneracy and abhorrency
in vice, by ſuch variety of
Wayes, faſhioning them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the habit of excellent
qualities; which performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
have ſet ſo many accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
Perſons into the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51447:69"/>
world, who if they had met
with Parents leſs careful,
they might have miſſed that
eſteem and veneration which
Ages have paid them: It
is true, that the force of a
Genius ſometimes ſupplies
the defect of a Parent; but
where they both aſſiſt, are
the moſt excellent pieces of
humane perfection; and
though Nature often does
much, yet we many times
find, that thoſe perſons are
to ſeek in the turnes of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Affairs, and in the
artful Traverſes of Glory,
who have not been very well
furniſhed with great variety
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51447:69"/>
of Images: and from hence has
roſe the defect that ſpoil'd
the whole frame of an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
virtue, deſign'd by
ſome perſons. In ſome
Men we have obſerved a
ſtrange aſſiduity in the queſt
of glorious Atchievments,
whilſt yet a diligent Remin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
will ſee more of affection
and earneſtneſs, then a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
dexterity in that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit.
There is a ſleight in
all Humane Affairs; which
though Nature may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
happen on it, yet can
never hit it with ſo much
certainty and ſucceſs as Art;
and hence it is, that a great
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51447:70"/>
draught of an Heroick vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is fain to be taken from ſo
many, becauſe no one perſon
appears furniſht with all
thoſe various Colours. Some
men have excelled for the
number and Art of their
Conqueſts; but the world
has ſeen them ſubdued by a
power from the Roſtra.
<hi>Achilles</hi>'s Shield was after
won by a virtue, different
from that in which its own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
excelled: the crafty <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
with his ſingle Conduct,
wound about the bravery
and vigour of the <hi>French</hi>
Affairs, which perfection in
any endowment, has aroſe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51447:70"/>
from a happy Education,
meeting with a good Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
and where it willingly
declines an accompliſhment,
it yet ſubmits to the force of
the diſcipline. So that to
Marriage the world ows the
Education of Mankind, and
by conſequence their fitneſs
and uſefulneſs to Humane
Affairs, which is a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
becauſe the ſecurity
of having our Iſſue well edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
is thereby eſtabliſhed,
and that care taken for the
coming Generation, which
our fathers had of ours; which
is ſo important a reflection
in the <hi>Series</hi> of ſucceſſion.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51447:71"/>
Marriage did moreover
prevent the inconveniencies
and extravagancies of a
rambling Love; for what
diſorder and diſtraction had
there been in the world, if
an impetuous and lawleſs
appetite had been ſubject to
no Conduct; but that the
fancy placing it ſelf upon any
Object, had preſently tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
the owner to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of violent actions; To
ſerve its mad deſires; Cities
had been conſumed to Aſhes,
Houſes left deſolate, or
filled with groans, only for
the raviſhment of a beautious
Prey: The Affairs of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51447:71"/>
State had been neglected, or
readily wounded for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements
of an idle Love,
for ſuch is the violence of
that Paſſion, and ſuch its
extravagancies, when it is
taught no moderation by
Religion, and excellent Laws:
The power of Conqueſt had
been a ſufficient Title to the
Objects we had coveted,
and we had felt no remorſe,
to have taken them from
between the Arms where
they had ſpent many years
in endearments of Love:
No Nation could have
flouriſhed, nor have been
ſucceſsful in its Affairs, if
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51447:72"/>
a wanton Flame had thus
conſumed the manly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and vigour of the
Youth; or if their paſſions
had not tranſported them to
ſuch violent Actions,
yet the gentleſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of thoſe Flames, had
made them uncapable of
ſerving the Commonwealth,
and the Intereſts of Humane
Society, and what with
running to publick Houſes
of Luſt, the contriving ſecret
Cabals, and private aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the Animoſities and
Jealouſies of Rivalſhip, the
prodigality of amorous
addreſſes, had took up all
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51447:72"/>
that time, and bafled all
thoſe advantages with which
they ſhould have ſerv'd
their Generations: Whilſt
they had followed theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
ill humour, reſtleſneſs
of the thoughts, and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Actions had been the
neceſſary Companions to
them; therefore there was
great wiſdom in that
Law amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> that
none ſhould live unmarried
after ſuch an Age: All wiſe
and prudent Governments
knew they ſhould have little
Order and leſs Induſtry,
where the affairs of an idle
paſſion poſſeſſed the Hearts
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51447:73"/>
and Heads of their Subjects.
Marriage more inclines the
mind to ſerious and neceſſary
buſineſs, then the wandring
Luſts of Stews and Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines;
and even in thoſe
Countries, where Poligamy
and many Loves have been
allowed, the ſerious and the
wiſe are grown weary of
their liberty, as producing
thoſe diſtractions, which
unfit the mind for other
things; Neither would the
diſorders of that paſſion have
only been injurious to the
preſent times, but have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
wronged poſterity;
which we may perceive by
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51447:73"/>
the <hi>Extravagants</hi> of this
Age, who live in a ſtrang
neglect of thoſe that come
after them: They care not
what becomes of the next
Generation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo they may Riot
and live voluptuouſly in
this; they have received by
ſucceſſion a travelling Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt;
which they are to
tranſmit downward, it being
to journey through all the
Ages of the world, but by
their Extravagancies and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
by their new wit, and
their modiſh vices, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
its affairs, they affront
its gravity, they ſtop its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,
and it is like to be
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51447:74"/>
known by after years with
leſs eſteem and veneration;
and this is that Age which is
like to be branded amongſt
all the Luſtres of ſucceſſion,
as the moſt diſingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
that ever was, who
have anſwered the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances
of the worlds im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Intereſts with Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aldry,
and a laſciviou Song;
they have affronted them by
the moſt unworthy practices,
&amp; gave them to underſtand,
that the divertiſements of
<hi>Drolls</hi> and <hi>Buffoons</hi> were
more valued by them,
then the gravity and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of their Fathers:
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51447:74"/>
and theſe ſottiſh incounters
appear the conſequences of
the neglect of Marriage, by
which the boſom of civil
Affairs has received thoſe
wounds, which the dexterity
and skill of coming Ages will
not eaſily Cure: that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
and lightneſs, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſneſs
and inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency
in our concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as have brought upon
the world ſo much diſorder
and inconveniece: No man
makes it his buſineſs to be
ſerious in any thing, but to
railly with diverſion and
mockery, even his pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and want, which are
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51447:75"/>
all deplorable effects, of that
injuſtice that the preſent
times have done to Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
In fine, that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
has applied the minds of
men to that induſtry and
care, which as they have
contributed to the peace and
the repoſe of the univerſe;
ſo they have produced thoſe
excellent things, that became
pleaſant and dear to humane
Race; the productions that
have been beſides it, were
rather for ſplendour then
uſe, and a gay ſhow, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the company of real
profit: The world has been
diverted with pleaſant Idea's,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51447:75"/>
with a fair arrangment
of amiable things; but the
performances of this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
have exhibited what
was uſeful and neceſſary.
The wanton humour, and
the airy fancy may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the ſolitary Hero's,
but the uxorious have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
and if we diligently
ſurvey the Intereſt of the
world, we ſhall find them
fitted for the Society of the
married life, and that they
muſt receive a ſtop and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
by the introducing of
other concernments; the
conſtitution of them muſt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51447:76"/>
be changed, and a new habit
introduced, before the world
can look well under the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of different opinions:
How happily it has ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with theſe Experiments,
what it has come to under
the Diſcipline of ſuch a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
will ſufficiently appear,
by looking backward; the
Powers it has eſtabliſhed;
the mingling Intereſt it has
confirmed; the mutual ſtock
of benefits it has ſetled; and
the great tranquility of all
things; ſufficiently prove,
that nothing could have been
more propitious to the
world then that condition:
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51447:76"/>
Neither does it ſerve leſs
effectually our particular
Affairs; if we look beyond
the contentments of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and a fading appetite to
thoſe which ariſe from a long
ſucceſſion, ſtretched with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
and reputation: to
live when we are dead
and gone, in a happy iſſue,
is much better, then only
for ſome Moments to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned,
to ſet in the Circle
of Marriage, agreeable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
always to entertain our
affection and our thoughts,
is much happier, then by
the little Artifices of time,
to be ever ſubject to deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51447:77"/>
who does not, that
pretends to reaſon, take
more pleaſure in managing
the Intereſts of a Family,
and a laſting name, then in
humouring a ſhort lived in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination:
and ſuch Affairs
have happily aſſiſted the
virtue of many perſons, who
thus diverted an injurious
leaſure; and as the Poet aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed,
the effeminacy of the
<hi>Greek</hi> to his idleneſs; ſo the
want of a juſt Intereſt to
manage, has brought in moſt
of thoſe inconveniences that
are found in the world;
and that pleaſantneſs and
gayneſs, which is childiſhly
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51447:77"/>
called good humour, ſo
much idolized in the ſingle
life, what is it but a trifling
and ſtrange impertinence!
a thing without all conduct
and prudence, and after the
follies of youth are over,
even inſupportable to thoſe
who have the moſt admired
it: All exceſſes in nature u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
produce the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams;
ſo the moſt aſpiring
Monarchs have often turned
Fryers, ſhrouding the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and luſtres of Regal
Majeſty in the Sables of a
Cloyſter, and men exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
voluptuous, grow ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neglectful and ſolitary
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51447:78"/>
when they are old: What
judgment can we paſs on
this, any otherwiſe then that
they laviſhly ſpend the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
ſtock of Nature, which
becoming bankrupt by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
practices, they are
after forced to yield to thoſe
humours, which ſpeak the
wants and poverties of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Marriage is ſuited to
the juſt temperament of
things; whilſt the other
practices conſiſt in thoſe
exceſſes that exhauſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belitate
nature; which like
ground too much uſed,
grows languid and unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
the mediocrity is that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51447:78"/>
which was deſigned in the
Affairs of the univerſe: And
he who takes them out of
that Channel, makes them
overflow all things of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and advantage, neither
will they be any longer uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and excellent when they
grow irregular: It is enough,
that by the allotments and
diſcipline tranſmitted to us,
we may live with ſolace and
advantage; but if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
thoſe Rules, we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
nothing but diſorder
and confuſion. Marriage
has hitherto defended the
Intereſts and the repoſe
of the world from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51447:79"/>
that in all Ages
has endeavoured to aſſault
them: And whilſt Mankind
grow weary of ſo brave and
ſucceſsful a defence: It is
well if they find out another
equal to it, though it is very
much to be feared, that thoſe
little Arts on which they
rely, will ſoon let them ſee
the errour of that fancy,
when they muſt call to their
aſſiſtance a greater force,
then what their Poets, or
their new Philoſophers can
bring them, and the ſad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of this gayneſs, and thoſe
Chymera's, will eaſily be
reſigned for the other uſeful
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51447:79"/>
and practical ſeriouſneſs,
then their modiſh humours,
their refined and elevated
fancies, their careleſs and
unaffected faſhioning of
things, together with their
couragious and profound
ſearches into Nature, will
appear the ſleights of thoſe
Empericks that have undone
the world, and if we ſhall
not be capable of ſo much
repentance as to curſe our
ſelves, our poſterity will do
it for us, for ſending them
into the world, rather fit for
Hoſpitals, or for <hi>Bedlam,</hi>
then the Affairs of a juſt
and happy life: To whom
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51447:80"/>
the good nature of their
fathers, for being ſo eaſily
abuſed, will appear a horrid
crime to their Iſſue, whilſt
they take to themſelves what
they called a wild pleaſure,
but left to theſe a ſerious
ſmart, and they muſt apply
themſelves to that Marriage,
that was injured and affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their Fathers, which
can only free them from the
Tyranny of thoſe practices,
to whom they had given the
Dominion, whoſe novelty
and great liberty ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
upon them, as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
their Obligations, and
their own Affairs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51447:80"/>
any remorſe to ſee Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
the being of many
Families, and the proſperity
and contentment of others,
whoſe waſts and ruines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
by whom they have
been plundered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Neither
will that fantaſtick Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
under which they
fooliſhly endeavour to put
their extravagant practices,
bring any ſecurity and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to the world, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
its ſtanding on an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
foundation, can reach
to nothing but a ſecurity
from <hi>Bravos.</hi> Marriage
knows all the Traverſes and
Turns of Humane Affairs,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51447:81"/>
and ſtands on a foundation
of Natures laying: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will that be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
down for right,
that has been wrong and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
in every Age: But
we may imagine, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
not to bring their
deſigns to perfection, leaſt
they ſhould too near reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the abhorred Wedlock:
they can hardly invent any
thing wild enough, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
enough for their
own practices, their appetites
call upon them for new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies;
and thoſe who
furniſh them with variety,
are at a loſs to contrive faſt
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51447:81"/>
enough to pleaſe them.
Whilſt we have thus Sir,
drawn the <hi>Portrait</hi> of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and reckon'd up its
advanages, if we reflect upon
it, we ſhall find the injuſtice
that ſome men have done it:
As for thoſe who admire
unſociable and ſolitary tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
they can have but ſlender
<hi>Pleas</hi> to an excellent mind:
Nature deſign'd no man to
that vanity, as to be taken
up with the contemplation
of his own endowments, like
the fantaſtick youth, who
made love to, and died for
himſelf: The only way to
take a right view of our
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51447:82"/>
own good qualities, is to ſee
them in leſs flattering <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi>
and to have them
drawn by thoſe advantages
and benefits we communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to others: He that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
all, his great endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
into his own Breaſt,
and keeps them there, like
Roſes that grow in Deſarts,
he dies uncommended and
uninjoyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all virtue is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſive,
and loves occaſions
to exerciſe its vivacy and
vigour; and what we carry
about us, ſufficiently declares
that we were not deſigned
to be happy alone, whilſt
both the ſolace of the mind,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51447:82"/>
and an endeared life, conſiſt
in an union with ſomething
different; the brighteſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
owe their vivacy to the
ſhade, and Nature has ſet
Virtue like Diamonds in Jet,
within the Circle of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
ſervices: And I cannot
remember, that ever the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
that great Receptacle
of the drowſy life, did ever
oblige the world by many
excellent performances; we
know very well what poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
Arrows have been ſhot
from thoſe Coverts, that
have pained and enraged the
boſom of many Ages; but
they are yet to give a proof
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51447:83"/>
their kindneſs to Humane
Nature, and their preſent
careleſneſs and vices, have
put us beyound all hope of
expecting it. But yet, it is
another ſort of ſpeculation,
which we are to accuſe in
theſe reflections. Some there
are, who with great folly and
injuſtice, make Marriage the
ſubject of their reproaches;
we do not accuſe any for
embracing the ſingle life,
whoſe Virtue is ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to bear them through
all the hazards of youth and
inclination, but yet, thoſe
who do this, ought to let
it be with leſs pride and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51447:83"/>
But that is the
ſtrange rudeneſs of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſentiments, to mock at
all practices that are different
from their own; and though
ſuch light diſcourſes will
weigh very little with wiſe
and prudent Perſons, yet
unexperienced youth is apt
to be affected with things
confidently delivered, though
there be ſometimes little
ſence in them, but this is
not only the matter of
converſation, but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
Theam of ſome wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and being a ſubject
capable of keenneſs, and
ſomething of novelty, men
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51447:84"/>
endeavour to raiſe the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of wit on that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation:
But I wiſh they
would conſider with how
much diſingenuity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs
they do it: Never
did any Age ſo thirſt after
the ſame of being Wits, yet
no Age has acquired ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloriouſly
that Title; It is
not ſure impoſſible for men
of ſuch great abilities as
they give themſelves out to
be, to pleaſe and inſtruct
the world at once, and not
to build the Triumphs of
their Eloquence, on the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
of their Morals? How
little reaſon has Mankind to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51447:84"/>
admire them, who furniſh
it with wit at ſo dear a rate:
They may tell us, that
affected <hi>Pedants,</hi> capable
of no generoſity, have for a
ſilly fame wounded the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
of ſacred and civil
things, but we are aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſee thoſe who pretend
to be Gentlemen of great
breeding and nobleneſs to
exceed their crime, and how
unhappy ought they to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
themſelves, that the
firſt proof which they give
of their injuſtice to humane
Affairs, and their ingratitude
to their Fathers, ſhould be
on the moſt important, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51447:85"/>
moſt excellent concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the univerſe: They
have introduced infinite
Punctilio's of reſpect, and
obſervance, they pretend to
correct the bluntneſs, and in
obſequiouſneſs of paſt Ages;
but they wound the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
whilſt they adore
the ſhadow, and we expect
from them to ſhew that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
which is ſo powerful
a part of their Genius, to the
moſt important concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which have been ſo
revered in the world, and ſo
beneficial to Humane Race<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If
they muſt exerciſe that doat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on wit of theirs, let them
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51447:85"/>
chooſe a ſubject more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Intereſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
of Mankind, and let
them think it to be a little
rude, to reproach the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of their Fathers, and
the greateſt part of the
world, which they do in
ſpeaking againſt Marriage:
But never any Age had
more trifling Gallantries,
and yet none was evermore
in love with them; great
capacities uſe to be ſerious,
modeſt and unaffected; but
now he that owns a little
wit, makes ſuch a noiſe
with it, as to diſturb the
quiet and the ſerious Affairs
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51447:86"/>
of the world; If they would
have us admire their great
abilities, let them give us a
more excellent proof of
them; let them again reſcue
thoſe Intereſts which they
have betrayed, or elſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to merit nothing, but
the reproaches and curſes of
the world. But that which
is yet a more important in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
to Marriage, is a certain
humour and opinion taken
up by ſome people, that it is a
piece of Gallantry and good
Breeding, to divert our ſelves
with ſacred Wedlock, as an
extraordinory proof that we
have overcome the Flegm of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51447:86"/>
a degenerate complexion;
if we ſpend all our life in
frolick <hi>Amours.</hi> There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
accuſation, that belongs
to theſe reflections; and that
is, of thoſe who are of this
Condition, whoſe affection
to it ought to be commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but their follies and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretions
ought to be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
It is not always found,
that a good intention can
free it ſelf from the blemiſhes
of an ill conduct, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of many Perſons, have
rendred ſome things ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
that would have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
their gravity in a
better management in this
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51447:87"/>
enquiry, the ſubject is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
nice and critical, and
ſo ought to be made with
great warineſs and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection;
beſides, to pry
into the miſcarrages of others
in ſo cloſe an union is a little
imprudent; but yet our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
converſation and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
will furniſh us with this
belief, that many commit
thoſe follies in Wedlock, that
become matter of divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to ſome Perſons, and
and an extream ſcandal to
others. One great cauſe
to be aſcribed of this, is,
that men live narrowly, and
to their particular inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51447:87"/>
and humours, forgeting
that they are to ſupport a
common concernment; and
we may very well believe,
that men may find as
much eaſe, and a great deal
more generous contentment,
if they tyed up their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
to a ſevere diſcretion,
then in permitting them to
wanton in all the liberties of
their little freedoms; How
few live with a careful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to their reputation,
and fewer conſider the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of a publick aim;
which neglects giving birth
to perpetual follies and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations,
amongſt other
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51447:88"/>
things that they prejudice,
Marriage ſuffers in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the indifferent or
prepoſſeſſed; Any thing that
is uneaſie in Wedlock ſhould
be concealed, and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a gravity, that might
cover it from the ſpectators;
No man ſhould gad abroad
with his complaints, which
as they render his condition
nothing the more eaſie, ſo
they either importune, or
divert thoſe to whom they
are communicated; it is
tireſome to the ſerious man
to be entertained with the
follies of another; and it
is Comical to the Frollick;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51447:88"/>
So that we receive no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by ſuch ſallies of great
weakneſs and indiſcretion,
and yet, though the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
be ſo momentary, as
only the eaſing of a preſent
fulneſs, yet the revelation of
ſuch Matters ſpread in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
and remains long
enough as a blemiſh on that
Condition; this open tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
has in ſome made an
injurious progreſs; reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the worſt treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the intimacies of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
the firſt Eſpouſals
proclaimed that two were
one, thereby to unite all
their concernments: The
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51447:89"/>
gallant <hi>Portia,</hi> tried her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy
on her wounded Arm,
to make an experiment of
her Sexes ſufficiency; which
whilſt ſhe bravely reſcued
from the reproches it had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd,
ſhe retorted the bluſhing
ſcandal upon ours: Friendſhip
is of all other bleſſings the
greateſt ſolace to humane Life,
and it is not only intimate,
but ſacred in the Circle of
Marriage: To communicate
our troubles, is to leſſen
them; and the Philoſopher
adviſed us, not to eat the
Heart, which he meant of
ſecret and concealed griefs:
The great diſtruſt of ſome
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51447:89"/>
men has appeared in hiding
under ground their wealth,
and this Age has in part
reaſon to have the ſame care
of their thoughts, which thoſe
had of their Treaſure: Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
were at firſt diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into particular dwellings,
that they ſhould have ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Intereſts; and injoy
their contentments in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered
ſhade; we call
it good humour to uſe all
manner of freedom in our
converſation; but how ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is it found, that others
will well interpret, what we
well deſign, It were eaſie
Sir, to lead this Current
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51447:90"/>
further, but it would be no
diſcretion to do it, and many
times we decline a ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
becauſe we fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
love our own manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
'Tis moreover cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
they beſt ſee their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
who diſcover them by
their own light, And that
not only, becauſe we find
our ſelves in ſome diſorder to
have them revealed; but alſo,
from a certain pride that
puts us upon juſtifying all
we do; and beſides, all the
dexterity of another, can
never fit the <hi>Perſpective</hi> to
our own ſight: But yet, there
are ſomethings ſo remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51447:90"/>
that there is no need
of theſe Glaſſes to diſcover
them, and there are ſome
crimes committed againſt that
Relation, which none will
attempt to extenuate, that
reſpect would be very inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
that ſhould forbear
the cenſure of the great
ſcandals that are flung upon
Marriage: The inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
of the Eſpouſed, is
that <hi>Crime</hi> whoſe Bowels are
filled with many others:
Neither can we readily ſay,
the influence it has had in the
world; ſince it is evident
that the ſacredneſs of this
Inſtitution, has kept the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51447:91"/>
Power above us with reſpect
upon our minds: Other
things have (though unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
been accuſed of Art,
but the great Antiquity of
Marriage declares its divine
original: And it has recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the ſame reſpect in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities
of Nations, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,
its Honour is ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that the leaſt blot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
it; and beſides,
incourages the hardyneſs
of after attempts, which take
them for a Preſident, who
were the firſt Invaders of
this ſeperated ſtate; by
whoſe attempts not only
that condition, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51447:91"/>
the principal foundation of
the moſt excellent advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
became ſhaken and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
but a way was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to that liberty, which after
made its incurſions into all
revered concernments. The
ſacredneſs of an Oath, and
Proteſtations uttered where
Heaven and Earth were the
Witneſſes, became the trifles
of Cuſtom and deſign; which
being made ſo by a wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appetite, that crime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the incouragement to a
freedom in other things:
What aſſaulted the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
we very well know;
and we have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51447:92"/>
that this Crime was
one of the firſt that attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the concernments of the
world! And it is like to be
that, which will give one of
the laſt wounds it muſt feel
before its ruine; this impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
awaiting it with a ſtrange
deſire, that it might owe the
fate of its nobleſt affairs to
its inhumanity alone, and no
reproaches are keen enough
for thoſe, who have made
theſe attempts, either from
the ſolitary life, or within
the ſociable: The latter is
the more prodigious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of treachery and
baſeneſs, becauſe he ſtrikes
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51447:92"/>
at the Heart and the Vitals;
he breaks that faith on which
Marriage is built, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
that fidelity which is
ſo much of its Eſſence, he
leaves it none of its reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but layes it under the
reproaches of Artifices and a
Juggle, he withholds others
from applying themſelves
to it, whilſt his practices
perſwade them, that it cures
no appetites, nor practiſes
any ſincerity: He unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuffers them to think, that
it is the Trap of youth, and
a Gin in which Policy has
caught our forward Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
He Incourages in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51447:93"/>
them a fancy, that it is better
to practice thoſe Liberties
before we vow, and aſſure
then to looſe an Innocence
in our reſtraint: He that
draws the Adulterer with
theſe Colours, will ſoon
find his amazement at ſo
horrid a ſpectacle; and juſtly
believe that nothing is known
ſo odious in <hi>Affrica,</hi> is this
Monſter of Society; ſince
he that devours the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and the candour of any
thing, ſhows a worſe cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
then the ſucking of its
Blood, and the generous at
any time, looſe their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
with more regret then
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51447:93"/>
their lives: He has made
Marriage to ſurvive its Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and to remain a
ſcandalized Inſtitution: He
has put the affront on the
firſt founder; and mocked
at the Limits of Nature; he
has endeavoured to perſwade
the world by his experience,
that Marriage is uncapable
of its deſigns, and that the
Ranges of luſt were to no
purpoſe incloſed, whilſt the
appetite is as ungoverned
even in that Condition,
which was deſigned to cure
it, as in a common injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
We will only ſay
further to theſe Perſons, that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51447:94"/>
they ſtand in the firſt Rank
of Criminals, and that it
had been better they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come into the world,
then only to have lived to
have done ſo much miſchief
in it; and that they muſt
one day be called from their
Graves, to be confronted
with the injured Affairs of
the univerſe, and not expect
ever to ſleep without the
<hi>Spectres</hi> of thoſe wounded
Intereſts. And now Sir,
after we have been ſerious
ſo long, it is agreeable to
our youth, to divert our
ſelves a little, with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
and the beautiful Scenes
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51447:94"/>
of Love, it would be but
juſt ſomething to looſen a
mind bound up to grave and
ſerious conſiderations, by
celebrating that Paſſion,
which is as well the Vigour
as the Imbeliſhment of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
But we are to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that the Theory which
has been exhibited to Ages
of this Inclination, is very
much different from that
Practick that has aſſiſted the
Affairs of the world; and we
muſt go another courſe then
what we have already took,
if we will follow the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
where the Poetick fancy
has led it: for thoſe are the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51447:95"/>
men who have pretended all
along to extoll and refine it:
Though the Diſcipline under
which it was put by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
was very unlike to the
modern Regulations. They
made it ſeek the ſociety of
Shepherds, and confined it to
the Woods and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
it ſpent its time in
weaving <hi>Corollas,</hi> and was
buſied in faſhioning the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
that merited the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:
It appeared baſhful
and unſociable, ſhunning the
guilt of ambition, with the
noiſe and Artifices of Cities:
It could divert it ſelf with
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51447:95"/>
telling the murmurs of a
Fountain, with repoſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Mirtle, or in weav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about the Pine with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amorous
Characters: It only
ſignalized it ſelf in the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of <hi>May:</hi> and preſerved
no greater marks of its State,
then the Tabor, and the Oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe:
It valued it ſelf upon
its ſincerity, and knew
no other bravery then to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
in Death the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
Object: It affected a
mind as free from Artifice,
as that beauty to which it
vowed, and opened its Soul,
as well as ſpent its Careſſes
in the Sun-beams, but this
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51447:96"/>
affected life, was yet judged
too inglorious and ſolitary
for it, by the briskneſs of
after Poets, who believed
that it ſhould value leſs its
innocence then its glory;
which made them lead it to
thoſe places where it might
ſignalize it ſelf in braver ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits,
their Predeceſſors
had faſhioned it too rude
and ſimple, and had armed
it with a Power that could
purchaſe it no Renown,
whilſt it was buſied in a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Chaſe, on the Lawnes and
the Mountains. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
took it from ſo trifling
a Diſcipline, they led it to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51447:96"/>
Courts, and gave it the
command of Armies: They
diſrobed it of the Habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a Shepherd, and
changed the Oat-pipe for a
Trumpet; they made it feel
its vigour, and experiment
the force of its Nature: A
diſtruſt of its ſtrength had
made it live ingloriouſly, and
they taught it what great
things it was able to do;
They made it not only to
deſpiſe the Sheep-hook, but
to make a trifle of Crowns:
but it was neceſſary that it
ſhould accommodate it ſelf
to a diſpoſition ſuitable to
its enterprizes, which made
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51447:97"/>
them exchange its ſincerity
and plainneſs, for diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and hollow Careſſes:
Neither did it ill manage
theſe endowments, if we
may credit their Records.
It brought in the faithleſs
<hi>Greek</hi> the fire that burnt <hi>Ilium</hi>
to Aſhes; and deſtroyed
what was then the faireſt
Dominion of the Earth:
but yet it was not altogether
intent upon one deſign;
whilſt it ſtopped the Glory
and Victories of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and
ſent him inviſible Chains,
from a captiv'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Town.
It triumphed over Regal
Author<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y, Duty, and the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51447:97"/>
care of a Patrimony in the
violent <hi>Scylla Eliza</hi> left not
only her <hi>Tyre,</hi> but a glorious
life imperfect, whilſt ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Sacrifice to the Love
of ſpruce <hi>Aeneas.</hi> It has gone
through the Blood of the
Innocent to reach a Throne,
where it might appear in
Royal imbeliſhments to
its Object. It has mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Intelligence in Glances,
and communicated Plots
by the Character of Looks:
It has been a ſpie in Armies,
and faſhioned the Intrigues
of Court. Theſe their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etick
fury reckoned brave,
but they have not at the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51447:98"/>
ſame time withheld it from
odd performances: They
have made it leap Precipices,
ſwallow Daggers, made Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
burne for Siſters, and
invaded the Fathers right of
Love by the ardour of the
Son. The inhumane <hi>Greek</hi>
Bedded his <hi>Seſtian</hi> Maid, in
the cold Sheets of Water,
and left them to conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
in the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> thoſe
loves he had ſo painfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled,
The fantaſtick <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
made <hi>Narciſſus</hi> burne
for the ſhadow of himſelf,
with ſo feirce a Flame, as
could only be quenched in
that Fountain where he view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51447:98"/>
his Image. It has turned
the Iſſue of Kings to Pilgrims,
and tranſported the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to deſpiſe a
brighter Immortality, whilſt
ſhe affected the ſhade of a
<hi>Corinna.</hi> Nay, under theſe
managers, Love has ſought
an Empire beyond the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of Nature, and carried
the remains of Rational be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
to Vegitables, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate:
It has turned Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
to Fountains, to Trees,
to Eccho's, and to Wall-flowers,
preſerving only in
the note, the murmur, or the
fragrant Character, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances
of a former
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51447:99"/>
ſtate, the wantonneſs of the
Poetick fancy, have in theſe
inſtances appeared very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant;
though they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
in all, to ſhew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Power of Love,
whilſt changing Natures
could not change Deſire:
Neither could all the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of a Metamorphoſis diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige
a faithful Paſſion;
<hi>Eccho</hi> though grief has worn
her to a ſhadow, preſerves
yet ſtrength enough to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to an amorous Call, the
<hi>Heliotrope</hi> yet linkes the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the cruel Sun, and
appears Melancholly, when
he forſakes its Company. But
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51447:99"/>
yet, after all theſe cruelties
and ſtrange Experiments, the
Poetick fancy could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
attone for ſo much
barbarouſneſs, but by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
Love to ſhave, and
retire to the Cloyſter: The
reflection on ſo much Blood
as it had ſpilt, could not but
naturally produce in it ſo
great a Melancholly; But
yet here, whilſt it pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be a Devote, it proved
a Monſter; and could not
forget the exerciſe of its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Tyranny; It is true,
it grew more Circumſpect,
but not leſs guilty; it ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
equally though in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51447:100"/>
way: It formerly inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the life and the felicity,
aud now the Innocence and
the Honour: It was more
open and plain in the former
attempts, but now it affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
privacy and Arts: The
world had felt enough of its
force and it therefore applied
it ſelf to Stratagems, and
diſſimulation, ſo long a War
as it had he'd with humanity,
had taught them to reinforce
and fortifie themſelves, and
therefore undermined what
it could not aſſault; It took
the habit of a Recluſe, and it
made many of their orders ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
but <hi>Fratricelles;</hi> It ſhewed
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51447:100"/>
to the world a mortified
look, and an Innocent Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit;
But its Altars burnt
with as brisk a Flame, and
were thronged with laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Votaries; it grew weary
of open cruelties, but ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enamoured of thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
ſleights: Here with a
ſhow of great humility it
devoured the portions of an
excellent Virtue, and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Innocence of the
world, with Fire diſguized
in Snow-balls: It whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Intrigues through the
Monaſtick Grate, and made
aſſignations at the foot of an
Altar: it coma'd amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51447:101"/>
ſentences with Beads;
and vigourated a laſcivious
Song with the Airs of an
Anthem: It bore it ſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guized
into the Pallaces of
<hi>Magnificos,</hi> and practiſed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour,
whilſt it proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Shriſt: It reſorted to
the Chair of confeſſion only
to eaſe an amorous boſome,
and demanded from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
not abſolution but
aſſiſtance: It kept Leigers
in Republicks of Virgins, and
held Intelligence with fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Honour: It was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored
whereever it came, and
prevented jealouſie by the
reputation of ſanctity. But
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51447:101"/>
though the ſucceſſes of Love
were great in this ſhade; yet
it participated ſo much of a
natural inconſtancy, as to
grow weary of ſo eaſie a
proſperity, and left its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
for more publick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters:
Its Elogies here
blunted the Poetick fancy,
whoſe flights whilſt they
were happy were yet regular
and confined; they reſolved
to make it a mad Cap, that
it might better ſerve the
Rhiming reach, that has
been ſo much the Idol
of preſent Ages, here it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
a Divinity, and
ſhewed a reſpect to Piety
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51447:102"/>
and Altars: But they better
affected its old Ethnick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs;
they liked it
only when it was too vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
for Earth, and too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
for Heaven: They
gave it a power above Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
and faſhioned it
a quality that ſhould <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount</hi>
the Univerſe. And
no ſooner had they thus
took it from the Cell, but
they furniſhed it out a Knight
Errant, and made it traverſe
Deſarts, they inured it to
hardſhip, and often forced
it to take up its Lodgings at
the foot of an Oak, or the
Banck of a Rivulct, whilſt it
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51447:102"/>
was fed, <hi>Cameleon</hi> like, on
the Air of ſighs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
it exerciſed its cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in hunting of Raviſhers,
in reſcuing diſtreſſed Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels;
in obtaining the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of captiv'd Knights,
and in putting an end to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments;
whilſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
again it affected the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Dragons, the incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of horrid Viſions; and
in appointing aſſignations in
the dark apartments and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence
of Spirits. But ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Poets declined theſe
Melancholy fancies; whilſt
they took Love from that
Diſcipline, and applied it to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51447:103"/>
the Affairs of Grandeur and
Society: They adopted it
into the Family of Atoms,
and made it the Captain of
thoſe Numerous Legions:
They gave it an extravagant
and unlimited Commiſſion,
and made it equal with that
appetite which they believe
to be the Genius of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe;
and the Trace they
have led it, has been agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their Idea's, they
have brought it on Theatres,
to inſpire thoſe <hi>Bravo</hi>'s
whom they call their <hi>Hero</hi>'s:
They have thought fit that
it ſhould ſignalize it ſelf only
in prodigies of valour, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51447:103"/>
miracles of Councel: It has
beſtowed a ſufficiency on a
ſingle Perſon to rout Armies,
to look Kings out of their
Thrones, and to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
more facile then Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
and more eaſie then
Traverſes: It has bafled all
the Stratagems of an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
and wound about at
pleaſure the fidelity and
courage of numerous Armies;
all which are found but
mean Exploits in the Records
of their <hi>Dryades.</hi> But yet
it does not always keep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
to the point of this
elevation; neither does it
ever affect to be ſo Heroick;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51447:104"/>
it is often pleaſed to divcrt
it ſelf with meaner Actionfs:
And to faſhion the foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Comedy: It can
make Experiments on the
Groome, and is not averſe
from an Intrigue with the
Landreſs; It is pleaſed with
the ſmall incounters, and the
fallacies of Maſcarade, and
delights in being Cajol'd, and
in committing Errours: Its
Principles ſpeake it an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
and declare its abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to be bound up to the
high Rules of its Glory,
whilſt it finds the ſweeteſt
Pleaſures in the moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Liberties; though it can
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:51447:104"/>
ſometimes deſpiſe Crowns,
and toſs them from one head
to another, yet it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
pleaſed with ſo hardy
an exerciſe: It can with as
much pleaſure, manage the
deſigns of the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid,
and receive Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from the brawny
Clown, that greatneſs is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie
to it, which ſtands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the divertiſments of
ordinary men, and it now
leſs affects Glory then good
Humour. But though this
paſſion appears active and
vigorous, yet it ſeems
but the effects of its Age;
whilſt it pleaſes it ſelf in
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51447:105"/>
odd and fruitleſs performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
It ſtuddies infinite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches,
and the Punctilio's
of a Genius weak and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
it grows hard to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and is pleaſed with
niceties and Criticiſms, before
things brave and ſubſtantial:
The Poetick Lawgivers have
formed it a State, and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
its obſervance; but it is
weary of that troubleſome
greatneſs, and they are forced
to indulge it in little Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
and childiſh divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
It has reach'd its
<hi>Climaterical</hi> Year, and forgets
its Grandeur ſo faſt, that
all the lofty nonſence of its
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51447:105"/>
ableſt Miniſters, cannot
preſerve it from a ſottiſh
Lethargy, they have carried
it to the Magnificent Pallaces
of Command, they have
ſhewed it the ſtate it ſhould
preſerve, and remonſtrated
it with an Eloquence, more
charming and refined then
their Fathers ever knew; But
it ſee's not the force of theſe
ſplendid Harangues; and
its glorious managers muſt
lament their misfortune, that
they were born in an Age,
when Love was ſo unable to
comply with thoſe precepts,
which they are ſo capable
of giving; So Rich and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51447:106"/>
Magnificent a ſence in the
dayes of its Youth, had
found it an aboad in Stars,
(from which ſome of its Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
pretend it to have come)
and it had uſed no more
theſe mortal divertiſements:
But unhappy Poets, they
practice in a time, when its
Nature is unfit to comply
with the Excellencies of
their Art; and yet they are
reſolved not to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unſucceſsful, they will
accompany it to another
world; Nay, they have
ſent their Poetick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fancies
before it, to prepare an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizium,</hi>
to furniſh it with
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51447:106"/>
Grotto's, with ſhady Groves,
and Rivers; They have
deſigned it an Eternal buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
to repeat a paſt fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Triumphs of
mortal incounters; They
have put it into the Arms of
a perpetual Spring of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
leaned it on a fragrant
boſome, and under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of bright and ſhining
Eyes; wherein ſo ſweet a
receſs, it muſt entertain it
ſelf for ever with repeating
its humane Atchievments;
yer if it find theſe Pleaſures
too luſcious, they will
permit it that varity in
Heaven, which they allowed
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51447:107"/>
on Earth; They have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it aſſignations in wither'd
hollow Trees, and weary
Traverſes in <hi>Sooty</hi> Regions,
They can imagine a perfect
tranquility in nothing, and
have framed their <hi>Elizium</hi>
according to the Colour and
Figure of its Atoms; which
they eſteem a happy
thought, ſince it would dull
ſo vigorous a Paſſion to be
confined to one enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
It would be tired
with ſitting for ever ſtill;
and therefore they reſolve
it ſhall be perplexed in
innumerable Labyrinths,
that it ſhall grow Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51447:107"/>
and delight to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the purple Current of
a Wound, that it ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
the <hi>Spectres</hi> of
jealouſie, and fright it ſelf
with its own ſhadow, that
it ſhall Tilt in Tourna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of fancy, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
Rivals, and win
Garlands: Thus have the
Poets ploted an Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
buſineſs to themſelves
in the managements of
Love, But yet they will
not leave its languiſhing
Affairs upon Earth, though
they accompany its lofty
Genius to <hi>Elizium;</hi> yet
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51447:108"/>
they will not quit its Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
part, whilſt it rots in
dirty Actions, they will
force a freſhneſs from that
withered Trunk, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the world, that it
is ſtill as lovely, and as
charming; as in all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity
and ſweetneſs of its
Life: But it is high time
to leave them, when they
grow ſo Extravagant.
Thus Sir, have I given
you a Proſpect of the
Poetick Image, which you
will find very unlike to
that which has the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of Marriage: The
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51447:108"/>
buſie world has all along
lain below this Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Paſſion, and would
have nothing to do with
its Chimera's: Sometimes
it received a wound from
thoſe Fantaſms; But it
endeavoured to cure it as
faſt as it could: They have
often made it propoſitions
for a Commerce, but they
were always ſtrange and
extravagant: Sometimes they
were too rude and ſimple,
and of a Melancholly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
its active Affairs: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhile
they were too
Heroick, and flew above
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51447:109"/>
their humility. Its reality
was too ſordid, and its
imbeliſhments altogether
uſeleſs and Romantick; It
therefore with great juſtice,
excluded them all from its
converſation, and took thoſe
Idea's that were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Actions, and not
of the Brain; It entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nothing above its Affairs,
and preſerved thoſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
in vigorous Actions,
whilſt it refuſed to refine
them by idle Harangues;
It ſaw too plainly, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
concernments, that
their imbeliſhed Theories
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51447:109"/>
had ruined their plactice,
and therefore would not
admit of the leiſure to
be flouriſht and extolled;
It deſpiſed Artful and fine
Records, whilſt it only
valued an active and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
tradition; which
it has conveyed to this Age,
in ſpight of all the attempts
have been made upon it;
and if it muſt be its Doom
to ſuffer now, it will not
only fall a Victime to the
injuſtice and ſottiſhneſs
of barbarous men, but
ſtand a mighty inſtance
of the approaching Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51447:110"/>
of the world;
which will even before its
diſſolution, grow too like
that <hi>Chaos</hi> it muſt be at
laſt; whilſt all its virtue
and glory will be darkened,
and grow a place frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only by a ſavage ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
in all its horrid
ſhapes, a youthful Virtue muſt
Traverſe it with abhorrency,
whilſt it incounters ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
frightful repreſentations
of vice, and the Ghoſts of
murdered Honours, and it
muſt at the ſame time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it ſelf from the <hi>Cyrcean</hi>
Poetick Note, whoſe harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51447:110"/>
blandiſhments will
lead it upon the Precipices
of ruine and diſhonour, and
are the great procures of
the Prey for monſtrous vices.
And thus that frame which
began with innocence and
Marriage, will end with
Crimes, and with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of it, it roſe with peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and amicable virtue; but
muſt fall with cruel and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
vices, and thoſe Flames
in which it ſhall ſuffer, will
like burning Glaſſes, be a
mirrour to ſhew the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
attempts of this Age;
The Atheiſt muſt behold
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51447:111"/>
with horrour a confutation
of his bold Philoſophy, in
the Period of that world,
to which he had given ſo
fantaſtick a beginning, and
the Poet, will with the ſame
ſurprize, ſee it the Stage of
that Tragedy, that will out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
all the dolours of his Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
fancy.</p>
