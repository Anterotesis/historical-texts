         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

not recite all that may be ſaid touching
this matter, but onely touch ſome chiefe
pointes, ſummarily which may helpe
you the better to vnderſtand the large
and learned tracts, that many notable
men haue written hereof. For the firſt:</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>That Chriſt the Sonne of God
doth gouerne all things as well, as
God the Father, is proued by
reaſon, example, and
aucthoritie.</head>
               <p>BY reaſon, if God by his wiſdome
made the worlde: that is, if that the
Eternall wiſdome of God, which is his
worde, the euerlaſting Sonne of God,
was preſent with God, when he made
the worlde: he is alſo with him in gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the worlde: but he was with God
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hen made the worlde, therefore he is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith him in gouerning of it.</p>
               <p>The equity of the firſt propoſition is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:25326:4"/>
grounded vpon moſt ſtrong reaſon:</p>
               <p>For as God created the worlde by
his wiſdome, ſo it is not to be beleeued,
that God gouerneth the worlde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his wiſdome, otherwiſe he ſhould
gouerne by chance.</p>
               <p>The ſecond propoſition is proued by
the teſtimony of the <hi>Apoſtle Hebr.</hi> 1.
<hi>by whom alſo he made the worldes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By example,</hi> Gen. 48. verſe 13. 14.
15. Then tooke Ioſeph them both, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim
in his right hand towards Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels
left hand, and Manaſſeh in his
left hande towarde Iſraels right hand,
ſo he brought them vnto him.</p>
               <p>But Iſraell ſtretched out his right
hand, and laid it on Ephraims head,
which was the yonger, and his left
hand vpon Manaſſehs head (directing
his handes on purpoſe) for Manaſſeh
was the elder.</p>
               <p>Alſo he bleſſed Ioſeph, and ſaid, the
God before whom my fathers Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
&amp; Izack did walk, the God which hath
fed me all my life longe vnto this day.</p>
               <p>In which wordes <hi>Iacob</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
Gods prouidence to ſtretch to
particuler men, euen to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:25326:4"/>
Then it followeth as verſ: 5. 16. <hi>The
Angell which hath deliuered me from
all euill, bleſſe the children, and let my
name be named vpon them, and the
name of my fathers Abraham, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zack,
that they may growe as fiſh, into
a multitude in middes of the earth.</hi> In
theſe wordes, the holy Patriarke <hi>Iacob</hi>
giueth that particular prouidence to the
Angell, which in the former verſe hee
had giuen to God: And that by the
name of Angell he vnderſtandeth no
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reature, is hereby proued, in that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
that this Angell had power to
bleſſe: ſaying to him, <hi>Bleſſe the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:</hi>
Hee then is the Angell, whome
<hi>Iacob</hi> was wont to call, the Angell of
the Lord, that is the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>Therefore in this place <hi>Iacob</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth
a prouidence ouer all things and
perſones, to the Angell: that is the
Sonne of God, as well as to God the
Father.</p>
               <p>By authoritie <hi>Iohn. 5. verſe 17. My
Father worketh and I worke:</hi> This
worke that Chriſte ſpeaketh of, is not to
be vnderſtood of the creation onely, but
alſo of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouerning of al things created.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:25326:5"/>
For this particle (hitherto) ſheweth
that he ment not onely that firſt worke
of his in creating all things with his
Father, but alſo another worke, which
he dayly excerciſeth, which cannot be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of any other, then of gouerning
all things with his Father.</p>
               <p>But here wee muſt obſerue this rule,
that the workes of the Trinitie are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuided.</p>
               <p>Therefore that which is the Fathers
worke, is the worke alſo of the Sonne,
and of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>That the Sonne of God doeth the
ſame workes that the Father doeth, is
alreadie proued: the ſame is to be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
alſo of the holy Ghoſt, by the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of Gods worde, as by that I reade
in the 139. Pſalme <hi>Whether ſhall I goe
from the Spirit? or whether ſhall I
flie from thy preſence? If I aſcende
into Heauen, thou art there: If I lie
downe in Hell thou art there: let me
take the winges of the morning, and
dwel in the vttermoſt partes of the Sea,
yet thether ſhall thine hand leade me,
and thy right hand holde me:</hi> Thus
is the firſt point breifly proued, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:25326:5"/>
Chriſt the Sonne of God, and the holy

            <div n="2" type="part">
               <p>Now to the ſeconde: that God by his
prouidence gouerneth all and euery
thing.</p>
               <p>There are very many that can wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
graunt, that God by his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
gouerneth all things in generall,
but that euery particular thing is ruled
by the ſame, they denie: with theſe men
therefore I minde to deale ſomewhat
largely, though not ſo learnedly, as the
cauſe requireth: (&amp; who is able to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle it
worthily?) Philoſophers haue in this
point had ſundry opinions: <hi>Epicurus</hi>
ſaid, that all things were ruled by
chaunce and fortune, and that God li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
idlely, and at eaſe in the Heauens:
which opinion, as impious, all men in
wordes condemne, and yet ſo we liue
that our liues are euident proofes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
vs, that in heart and ſoule
wee embrace it.</p>
               <p>For ſurely if wee thought better
of God then <hi>Epicurus</hi> did, wee
would not walke ſo directly in <hi>Epicurus</hi>
pathes as we do, or liue ſo licentiouſly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:25326:6"/>
as though God regarded vs not.</p>
               <p>The Peripatetickes, and other ſort
of Philoſophers, broched another opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
teaching that thoſe things which
are aboue the Heauens, are moued,
guided, and gouerned by God himſelfe:
but thoſe things that are vnder the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the Moone, are gouerned partly by
chance and fortune, partly by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes
and deuiſes of men, and partly
by a brutiſh, or ſenceleſſe force of nature.</p>
               <p>Ther is a third opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Stoickes,
which is that all things are ruled by
fate or deſtinie, that is by a ſecret order,
and linke of cauſes: in which chaine, all
things are ſo ſurely tied, that both God
himſelfe and man are ſtraighted within
thoſe boundes.</p>
               <p>This was a very dainty opinion in
the iudgement of the Poets: who to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
the weakneſſe of their God <hi>Iupiter,</hi>
fained that he wept, for that he was ſo
hindered by the force of deſtinie, that
he could not ſet <hi>Sarpedo</hi> at liberty.</p>
               <p>The fourth opinion is <hi>Platoes,</hi> who
graunteth that God by his prouidence
ruleth all things in generall, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
God commiteth to petty Gods,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:25326:6"/>
halfe Gods, and Deuils, who haue the
charge and care of particular things:
From theſe foure opinions, ſpring all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whatſoeuer, touching Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
and there is no one opinion,
which may not eaſily be reduced to one
of theſe.</p>
               <p>But ſome of vs (euen of vs Chriſtians)
flying one danger, runne into another:
and for that they dare not deny that
God by his prouidence ruleth all things,
yet will they not graunt, that by it, he
gouerneth euery particular thing, leaſt
they ſhould thereby be driuen (as they
thinke) to ſome abſurdities: thus whilſt
they would auoide abſurditie, they
commit impiety and fall away from the
truth moſt dangerouſly: But farre be
this from your heart (Right worſhipful)
and that it may neuer poſſeſſe you: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide
the cauſe that worketh it in them,
which is ignorance of the word of God:
and for that God in great mercy hath
kindled in your heart a deſire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
quench not that godly deſire in
you, but purſue hotely with harty and
feruent prayer, after knowledge, and
you ſhall finde it. And if you ſhall finde
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:25326:7"/>
it, you ſhall certainly know, that there
will no abſurdity be inforced vpon any
doctrine grounded vpon Gods worde,
and that you need not feare this doctrine,
as they do: I wil firſt diſcourſe briefly of
the truth of it, and will proue, that God
gouerneth by his prouidence all things
generally, and euerie particular thing
particularly: then will I anſwere to all
thoſe chiefe obiections which are brought
againſt it, and by which ſome vaine men
thinke to make the doctrine abſurde.
To the firſt:</p>
               <p>For that this argument hath bene
diuerſly handled, and men haue bene
verie curious in diſcourſing thereof: eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
ſince what way ſoeuer they
winde themſelues, many abſurdities
do ſeeme to follow them: it will be beſt
I thinke for me to keepe me in the high
beaten way, leaſt ſeeking by wayes, I
wander out of the way: I meane to
diſcourſe ſo of this doctrine, as I am
taught in the worde of God, and then
diligently to remooue all thoſe things
what ſoeuer they be, not beſeming y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt
pure nature of God, which in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of men, ſhall ſome hereof to follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:25326:7"/>
But if my ignorance were ſo great,
that I could not remoue theſe inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences:
yet not withſtanding, are you
and all Chriſtians bounde to receiue
with all humilitie this true doctrine:
and to blame me not, the doctrine, if I
be not able to cleare it of all thoſe things,
which in the iudgement of man may
ſeeme abſurde: And although it is not
my purpoſe, to examine all, that Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
and others ſay againſt the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of euery thing by the prouidence of
God, yet in my minde, all that they can
ſay againſt it, may by this one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be eaſily ouerthrowne. If he be a
God (which they all confeſſe, &amp; though
they would denie it, yet may it eaſilie
be proued againſt them) hee is a moſt
perfect thing: but that which is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
hath nothing perfecter then it ſelfe,
neither can we imagine any thing to be
more perfect, then that which of it ſelfe,
is truly and abſolutely moſt perfect:
therefore there is nothing, neither can
we imagine any thing to be more perfect
then God: here vpon I inferre, if God did
not gouerne al things in general, &amp; euery
thing in particular, wee might well
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:25326:8"/>
imagine that there was ſomething more
perfect then God: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch a diety, which
had charge and care of euerie particuler
thing: but it is ſhewed that no ſuch diety
or God-head cau be imagined.</p>
               <p>It is falſe therfore, that they hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
would infer that God by his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
ruleth not euerie particular thing,
&amp; the contrarie is true, which we teach:
for elſe ſurely that God, which they
dreame of to liue idleis, &amp; at eaſe, and to
haue no care of any thing, as they babble,
is not in truth a God, but as <hi>Tullye</hi>
ſometime ſaid of their maiſter <hi>Epicurus,</hi>
ſo ſay I of them, that they in wordes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
a God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in truth deny that
there is any. But leauing Philoſophers,
let vs ſee what the Scripture teacheth
vs: the firſt place I wil vſe for the proofe
of this Doctrine, I take out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Epiſtle
to the <hi>Hebrues</hi> the 1. Chapter. verſe.
3. where it is ſaide of the Sonne of
God, that <hi>He beareth vp,</hi> that is, moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
and gouerneth all things by his
mightie worde: he that granteth that he
ruleth all thinges, excepteth no one thing
from his gouernement: wee may then
well conclude out of this place of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:25326:8"/>
God, that God gouerneth all, and euery
thing.</p>
               <p>But leſt I ſhould leaue any ſtarting
hole for the aduerſarie to winde out at,
let vs further ſee what the Scripture
teacheth vs of the gouerning of euery
particular thing by Gods prouidence.</p>
               <p>Neither will I heape vp many places,
but content my ſelfe with a few exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
out of which the truth of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
may be gathered.</p>
               <p>And thus I do endeuour to proue it
breifly: All the creatures of God are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indued with the gift of free choiſe, or
els want this libertie of choiſe: they that
haue it, are Angels, both good and euill,
and men alſo both good and euill: they
that want this libertie of choiſe, are all
other liuing things created by God, and
alſo thoſe his creatures which haue no
life: and yet of all theſe creatures, God
hath a ſpeciall care, ſo as hee diſpoſeth of
euery one of them according to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>The booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> and the Pſalmes,
do very often handle this argument, ſo
that if I ſhould gather out of them all
their proofes, I ſhould write out almoſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:25326:9"/>
their whole bookes: yet ſome I will
bring, and leaue the reſt for you to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
hoping it will be a meanes to bring
you to the often reading of them.</p>
               <p>In the 147. Pſalme the <hi>Prophet</hi>
ſaith thus of God, <hi>that the couereth the
Heauen with cloudes, and prepareth
raine for the earth, and maketh the
graſſe to growe vpon the mountaines:</hi>
But the cloudes, the raine, and the
graſſe are things without ſoule and life,
and yet by his wonderfull prouidence
he driueth, and ruleth at his pleaſure
the cloudes in the aire: he ſendeth the
raine downe vpon the earth, and he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the graſſe to grow: In the 148.
Pſalm. the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith, <hi>that fire
and haile, ſnow, and vapours, ſtormie
windes do execute his worde,</hi> and
what is it to execute the worde of God,
but to be ruled and gouerne by his
worde, it is to be at his becke and
pleaſure: Againe, in the 135. Pſalme, it
is ſaid, <hi>that whatſoeuer pleaſed the
Lord, that did he in heauen and in
earth, in the Sea, and all the depthes:
he bringeth vp the cloudes from the
endes of the earth, and maketh the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:25326:9"/>
lightnings with the raine, he draweth
forth the windes out of his treaſures:</hi>
and Chriſt our Sauiour in the 6. of
<hi>Math.</hi> biddeth vs <hi>learne how the Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of the field do growe, they labour
not neither ſpin:</hi> and a little afterward
he telleth vs, <hi>that God doth cloath the
graſſe of the field:</hi> theſe fewe places
proue that God hath a prouident care,
to keepe and gouerne euen his lifeleſſe
creatures, not onely generally, but
alſo particularly: as cloudes, raine,
windes, graſſe, fire, haile, ſnow, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
lillies, and ſuch like: the like
prouident care he hath for other of his
creatures, whome hee hath indued
with the life and ſence, but not with reaſon
and that libertie of choiſe, whereof I
ſpake before: Wee reade in the 147.
Pſalme <hi>that God giueth to beaſts
their foode, and to the yong Rauens
that crie:</hi> and in the 104. Pſalme verſ.
14. the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith, <hi>that God cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
graſſe to growe for the cattell,</hi>
and afterward in the 27. verſe hee ſaith,
<hi>that all beaſts, foules, and fiſhes, waite
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee O Lord that thou maiſt giue
them food in due ſeaſon: thou giueſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:25326:10"/>
it to them, and they gather it, thou o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneſt
thy hand and they are ſilled
with good things:</hi> This alſo our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Chriſt affirmeth in the 6.
of <hi>Mathew,</hi> ſaying, <hi>beholde the foules
of the Heauen, for they ſowe not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reape, nor carye into the barnes:
yet your heauenly Father feedeth
them.</hi> And in the 10. of <hi>Math. Are not
two Sparrowes ſold for a farthing,
and one of them ſhall not fall on the
ground without your Father?</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
God: by theſe few places you may
ſee it ſufficiently proued, that God hath
a prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t care of euery particular crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom he hath not beſtowed y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
free libertie of choiſe, whether they haue
not life, or haue life and ſence and want
reaſon. Now as for thoſe creatures to
whom God hath giuen that gift of free
choiſe, which I ſaid were Angels and
men, ſome do thinke, that God in truth
hath a ſpeciall prouident care ouer man,
whom hee made after his owne I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
and likenes: but not ouer other
creatures: which opinion how falſe it is,
you may eaſily gather out of that I
haue already written. Others do make
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:25326:10"/>
this to be the difference betweene man
and man, that God taketh a ſpeciall care
of the godly, but caſteth away all care of
the wicked: but the worde of God doth
manifeſtly ouerthrow this opinion: In
the 5. of <hi>Math.</hi> Chriſt our Sauiour
teacheth vs, that our heauenly Father
maketh his Sun to ariſe on the euil and
on the good, and ſendeth raine on the
iuſt and vniuſt: And <hi>Paul</hi> in his firſt
Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> the 4. chapter, ſaith
<hi>that God is Sauiour of al men, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of thoſe that beleue:</hi> wherof I gather
that God hath a ſpeciall care of thoſe
that are his, but yet not ſo, as that hee
leaueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked to be ruled by chance
&amp; fortune: for if God haue a care of thoſe
things and creatures that the wicked
poſſeſſe, as of their cattell, graſſe, and
corne, and ſuch like: ſurely hee proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
alſo for them, the owners &amp; maſters
of thoſe creatures: neither can he be
prouident &amp; carefull for the godly, but he
muſt alſo gouerne, and rule the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
according to the pleaſure of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
power. For as a Prince
and Generall of an armie is not
onely carefull for the troupes and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:25326:11"/>
companies of Souldiers that be in his
hoſt: but alſo for munitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; vittaile neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that hee may haue his army
ſo furniſhed, that it may be a terror to
the enemie, and may keepe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whome he lieth incamped in
ſuch dutifull obedience, that they may
be ready to doe whatſoeuer his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and officers commaund them: ſo
can it not be that God doth prouide for
his Church, but he muſt alſo moderate
and gouerne all thoſe things, without
which his Church cannot be here vpon
the earth.</p>
               <p>Such things as appartaine to the
nouriſhment, cloathing, ſafe and quiet
harboring of the members of the
Church: They therefore who are
not of the true Church, are yet, for the
benifit of Gods Church, to be ruled by
his prouidence, ſo are the Patriarches
ſaide to haue founde fauour in the eyes
of infidelles, for that the Lord did rule
and moue the hearts of infidelles, which
way it pleaſed him.</p>
               <p>Now how God ruleth not onely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
particular man, but alſo all the
ſeuerall actions of men, is proued by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:25326:11"/>
that which is in the 16 of the Prouerbs,
<hi>Commit thy workes vnto the Lord,
and thy thoughts ſhall be directed:</hi>
And by that alſo which is in the 4. of
<hi>Iames: goe to now ye that ſay, to day
or to morrow wee will goe into ſuch
a Citie, and continue there a yeare,
and buy and ſell and get gaine: and
yet ye cannot tell what ſhall be to
morrow: for what is your life? it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
a vapour, it appeareth for a little
time, and afterward vanquiſheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
for that we ought to ſay, if the
Lord will, and if wee liue we will doe
this or that:</hi> Thus <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaking of
the actions or doings of men, affirmeth
that God ruleth them all, ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his will wee can doe nothing, no
not ſo much as paſſe from one place to
another: and <hi>Paul</hi> coufeſſeth that hee
was often hindred and ſtaied by God,
that he could not goe to thoſe Churches
hee purpoſed, vntill hee had his iourney
graunted him by the will of God: God
therefore ruleth all the ſeuerall actions
of all men. I will vſe onely two exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
to illuſtrate and make plaine this
moſt true doctrine, that God gouerneth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:25326:12"/>
the ſeuerall actions of all men, both good
and bad: In the hiſtorie of <hi>Ioſeph</hi>
many things to this purpoſe are to bee
founde: the end of that hiſtorie was
that which <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſpake of, Geneſis 50.
<hi>you thought euill againſt me ſaith hee
to his brethren, but God diſpoſed it to
good:</hi> In this hiſtorie theſe men and
their ſeuerall actions are to be wayed:
Firſt father <hi>Iacob,</hi> then the brethren
of <hi>Ioſeph, Ioſeph</hi> himſelfe, the <hi>Iſhma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi>
to whom hee was ſold, that light
huſwife his miſtris <hi>Putiphars</hi> wife,
<hi>Pharao</hi> and his ſeruants: the actions
of all theſe perſons are diuers and very
different one from another, ſome of
them were laudable, others deteſtable,
and yet ſome of thoſe better then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and ſome of thoſe actions neither
to be altogether allowed nor diſpraiſed,
&amp; yet as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> witneſſeth, God by his
prouidence ruleth &amp; diſpoſeth them all,
both men and their actions to <hi>Ioſephs</hi>
good.</p>
               <p>So as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, Pſalme 105. <hi>that
God ſent a man before them, Ioſeph
was ſold for a ſlaue:</hi> For ſo God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth
the wicked actions of thoſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:25326:12"/>
men, that the moſte peruerſe practiſes
of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren, the ſhameleſſe
and beaſtly part of <hi>Putiphar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> wife,
and other heauie actions, had a moſt
happie ende: ſo that euen thoſe things
that they did to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> purpoſing by
them vtterly to deſtroy him, brought
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> to great honour: ſo mightie
and wonderfull is God, that he is able
to make the light to ſhine out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
more-ouer in the laſt chapter of
the propheſie of <hi>Ionas,</hi> wee ſhall ſee
how wonderfully God doth not only go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
men, but alſo all manner of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ſenſible &amp; vnſenſible: for I reade
that <hi>Ionah</hi> went out of the Citie of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niueh,</hi>
&amp; ſat on the Eaſt ſide of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citie,
&amp; there made him a booth &amp; ſat vnder it
in the ſhadow till he might ſe what ſhold
be don to the Citie: and the Lord prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a Gourd, &amp; made it to come vp ouer
<hi>Ionah,</hi> that it might bee a ſhadow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
his head, and deliuer him from
his griefe: ſo <hi>Ionah</hi> was exceeding
glad of the Gourd. But God prepa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
a worme when the morning
roſe the next day, and it ſmote
the Gourd that it withered: and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:25326:13"/>
when the Sunne did ariſe, God prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
alſo a feruent Eaſt winde, and the
Sunne beate vpon the head of <hi>Ionah,</hi>
that hee fainted, and wiſhed in his
heart to dye, and ſaid <hi>It is better for
mee to dye then to liue:</hi> in this that I
haue written out of <hi>Ionas</hi> wee haue
theſe things to waye: Firſt <hi>Ionah</hi> a
man, the moſt excellenteſt creature,
the other baſer creatures, as the
Gourd, the worme, and the winde:
The worme is a creature that hath life
in it, and is of that kinde of beaſts that
be deuided in their bodies, the head and
breaſt from their belly and taile, the
Gourd and the wind they are creatures
without life, and yet you ſee how God
by his prouidence ruleth and moueth at
his pleaſure all theſe creatures. If <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi>
had bene at this ſight, hee would
haue aſcribed all to chaunce: if <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>
to naturall cauſes: if <hi>Chryſippus</hi>
or <hi>Zeno Stoicks,</hi> to fate and to deſtinie:
if <hi>Plato</hi> to ſome petty god: and amongſt
them all there had not bene one worde
of the trueth of God.</p>
               <p>But the holy Ghoſt attributeth the
courſe of gouerning all theſe things to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:25326:13"/>
God alone, who prepared them all for
<hi>Ionah</hi> his good: for by theſe meanes,
<hi>Ionah</hi> that was wandring, was ſet in
the right way, as if you will reade the
chapter you may ſee more fully of that
which I haue already written. I may
ſafely conclude, that both all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
which want the gift of choiſe, and
all they that haue it, are gouerned and
ruled by God, by his moſt high and
mightie prouidence.</p>
               <p>Of the Angels, which I placed at
the firſt amongſt thoſe creatures, that
haue the libertie of choiſe, I will write
now the leſſe, hoping that I ſhall haue
this backe againe to view, poliſh, and
enlarge: but their name teacheth vs
that they are ruled by God him ſelfe,
for they are called <hi>Angeli</hi> Angels, that
is, meſſengers ſent from God: and in
the Epiſtle to the Hebrues are called
<hi>the miniſters, and ſeruants of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much for the firſt parte, that
is for the truth of this doctrine, that
God by his prouidence ruled all things
in generall, and euery particular thing
in particular.</p>
               <p>Now come I to that I promiſed to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:25326:14"/>
handle in the ſecond place, namely to
the vnfolding and anſwering of thoſe
arguments which are made againſt
this doctrine. The firſt argument
they make is this: God cannot go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
all things generally, and euery
creature and action without exeeding
toile and griefe of minde: But if agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with the nature of God, that he
reſt in quiet and be free from all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
Therefore God doth not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
all and euery particular thing.</p>
               <p>To this argument drawne thus
from the nature of God, I anſwere,
that their firſt propoſition is falſe,
which is that God cannot gouerne all
things generally and particularly
without exceeding foile, and greife of
minde: but for that I will not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
it as falſe, but ſhew the reaſons
that mooue me ſo to doe, you muſt know
that there are diuers kindes of actions,
ſome are naturall, ſome are violent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſome meane: that is neither altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
naturall, nor altogether violent:
naturall actions are they that doe flowe
from the principles of nature it ſelfe,
without any helpe elſewhere: ſuch are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:25326:14"/>
the round motions of the heauens, the
flowing and ebbing of the ſea, that
light things doe of their naturall light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
mount vpward, heauie things fal
downeward, that we breath and ſuch
like: theſe actions are done without any
labour, becauſe they mooue of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
without any other helpe: Other
actions there are, which are done by
force, and therefore are called violent,
as by force to make a ſtone mount vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
whoſe nature is to fall downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
And ſuch like violent actions,
which cannot longe laſt as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
teacheth, becauſe they are done with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orce. There is another ſort of actions
which I called meane, whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
are of nature, but yet
they cannot be done vnleſſe they be
helped by ſome other meanes, as to
eate, to drinke, to walke, and ſuch
like. But now that, that God doth,
hee doth without labour, becauſe
hee doth it naturally, and therefore
moſt freely: againe, there is no
force that can compell God, and
therefore hee worketh of himſelfe
freely without any compulſion:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:25326:15"/>
neither is hee troubled with greifes, but
gouerneth all things according to the
rule of his will: neither is there any
thing more agreable to the nature of
God, then to gouerne, and preſerue
the whole worlde, euen with the
worde of his power.</p>
               <p>A ſecond argument of theirs is this,
It is an vnmeete thing for God, and
cleane repugnant to his nature, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle
in filthy, and vncleane
matters but hee cannot gouerne euery
ſeuerall creature, and their actions, but
hee muſt entermeddle with many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane,
and filthie matters: therefore
hee doth not gouerne them.</p>
               <p>I denie the ſecond propoſition, which
is, that God cannot gouerne euery ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
creature and their actions, but he
muſt mingle himſelfe with many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane,
and filthy matters: For that
amongſt the creatures, and their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
there are many vncleane things:
this conſequence, though it bee the
grounde of the propoſition is falſe, for
although the power of God is in all his
creatures, and ruled all, yet doth it
not therefore follow, that the nature
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:25326:15"/>
of God doth entermeddle with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
actions of his creatures, which
may be made plaine by this ſimilitude:
the Sunne of all viſible creatures moſt
excellent (man onely excepted) doth
moſt ſet forth the glory of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it doth
ſhine in euery place, ſo that it ſhineth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
vpon the dunghill, and though the
beames thereof do heat the dunghill, as
they do all other places, and thinges
which they peirce, Yet for all that the
Sunne is not polluted with the defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and vncleaneſſe of it, neither
doth the ſubſtance of the beames of the
Sunne mingle it ſelfe with thoſe
things which it pearceth.</p>
               <p>When one laid this in <hi>Diogenes</hi>
his diſh, that he went into a ſtewes or
brothels houſe, why ſaith hee the Sun
commeth thither alſo, and yet is not
defiled therewith: therby ſhewing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
a wife &amp; godly man though he enter into
vncleane and filthie places, and come
into the companie of filthie perſons,
doth not forthwith toyne himſelfe to
their filthineſſe, neither is infected with
their vices: If therefore this Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
could enter into the ſtewes, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:25326:16"/>
come forth againe vnſpotted with their
vncleaneſſe, ſo that their filthineſſe
could not faſten vpon him: much loſſe
is God (whoſe nature is moſt pure and
ſimple in gouerning of his creatures)
inſected with their filthineſſe. There
is a third obiection, which they thus
frame: Euery wiſe and good gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
vnleſſe hee be greatly hindred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
bringeth his worke that hee frameth,
and that thing that he ruleth to a good,
perfect and wiſhed ende: this may bee
proued by many examples, as by the
example of a ſkilfull Pilot, who direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and bringeth his ſhip to the purpoſed
hauen, and ſuch like: but nothing can
let God from perfecting his workes,
and yet many of his creatures, as many
monſters, mad men, lame, are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
Therefore God ruleth not euery
generation and conception: to vnloſe
this knot wee muſt remember this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of order: there are two ſorts of
orders or courſes that God taketh in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning
all things: the one of them wee
may call ordinary, which God doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
vſe, the other extraordinary, with
which order though we be not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:25326:16"/>
yet doth God himſelfe know the
cauſe why he ſo worketh: &amp; yet of this
may we not conclude, that God in his
workes is contrarie to himſelfe: for if
to vs there appeare ſome dinerſitie and
difference in the gouernement of all
things by God, certainely that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is not of Gods rule, but of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
iudgement of our troubled
mindes: for Gods workes are not to be
balanced by our iudgements, which
are deceauable, and for the moſt part
vntrue: <hi>Auguſtine</hi> propoſed the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of two children, one of which is du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
and louing to his father, the other
is a wicked ſtubberne childe: both their
fathers are deadly ſick, the good childe
prayeth earneſtly vnto God, to deliuer
his father from his ſicknes: the graceles
graft thinketh euery hour twenty vntil
his father be breathleſſe: both their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
died and that according to Gods
appointement and direction.</p>
               <p>But now that childe that prayed for
the prolonging of his fathers life,
highly pleaſed God: and yet it
pleaſed not God, that his father
ſhould liue any longer: and againe,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:25326:17"/>
that childe that longed for his fathers
death, as highly diſpleaſed God, and
yet it was Gods pleaſure that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too ſhould dye: how commeth it to
paſſe, that that which pleaſeth God
may diſpleaſe him alſo, and that which
diſpleaſeth him, pleaſe him? as he was
pleaſed with the good childs kindneſſe,
but not pleaſed that his father ſhould
liue: and again diſpleaſed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
part of the lewd childe, and yet
pleaſed with his fathers death.</p>
               <p>Surely there is in God a certaine
ſecret ordinaunce which yet is iuſt, and
a certaine ordinance open and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted,
which alſo is righteous: But
certaine idle companions to draw both
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> and vs into hatred, for this
doctrine, obiect againſt vs, that they
cannot perceiue in God this double wil,
which we ſpeake of, to witte, a ſecret
and a reuealed will: for they ſay we all
know and you confeſſe, that God is
moſt plaine without all ſhew of dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe,
and therefore his will muſt
be alſo as plaine, and euen ſo is it,
though wee cannot comprehend it: but

But Chriſt ſaith otherwiſe of the man
that was borne blinde in the 9. of <hi>Iohn.
Neither hath this man ſinned, nor his

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>od might be glorified by him.</hi> Now
ſince the laſt end of al things is the glory
of God, and ſince all thoſe things are to
bee accounted perfect, which attaine to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:25326:18"/>
their deſired end, and ſince the glorie of
God more appeareth by the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of ſome of his creatures, then if
hee had made them all in one forme and
perfection, ſurely we may not iudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his workes vnperfect: I graunt
that if they be conſidered in themſelues,
there will appeare in them ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection:
but when they are referred
to the glorie of God, if they illuſtrate
and ſet it forth, they are euen therefore
to be accounted perfect: for if no man
ſhould be mad, if none deformed, none
lame, none blinde, wee would aſcribe
the perfection of our birth, which wee
perceiued that all men haue neceſſarily
either to nature or to our parents: and
we would eaſily ſlip into this opinion,
that wee had our ſolues alſo of our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents:
but ſince there appeareth ſuch a
diuerſitie in the outward ſormes of
creatures, the prouidence of God doth
more clearely appeare by that their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in ſhape. In the iudgement of
man, many flies and wormes, and all
ſort of ſerpents are reputed not onely
vnprofitable but alſo hurtfull: But
the Lord (as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſheweth in his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:25326:18"/>
ſong) calleth them his treaſures, out
of which, hee draweth vengeance for
his enemies, as arrowes out of a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the ſhafts hee ſhooke
<hi>Pharao</hi> with: with theſe <hi>Antiochus,</hi>

who therefore will account them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,

the Lord him ſelfe hath ſuch vſes to

               <p>There are alſo in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many profitable

laſt, and the cheifeſt end of all things,
and by the common conſent of all men,
euery thing is iudged either perfect or
vnperfect, by the attaining of his ende?
There is a fourth argument, thus made
againſt the prouidence of God: If God
who is moſt wiſe and righteous in his
iudgements, doe gouerne all things,
&amp; euery particular thing there ſhold not
be ſo great troubles in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealths,
and ſpecially in the Church, whereof
the Lord hath a ſpeciall care, for that it
is his Sanctuarie: but both in Church
and common-wealth there is great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe,
ſo that all lawes both diuine
and humane are openly violated: good
men moſt cruelly are delte withall, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
men do reioyce and triumphe in
their wickedneſſe without controle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
God therfore gouerneth not all
things that are in common-wealths and
in the Churches.</p>
               <p>This argument thus drawne from
the nature of Gods iuſtice (which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be contrary to his gouernement
by his prouidence, if he ſhold ſee, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and ſuffer all theſe outrages and

                  <hi>Woe be to thee</hi> (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

plagueth another, &amp; though tyrants
be a plague to all nations &amp; Kingdomes
yet are they themſelues in due time
in like ſort puniſhed by other tyrants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
In the perſon of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gements
of God are very liuely ſet
forth by the prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in the tenth
Chapter of his propheſie: The Lord
ſtirreth vp the King of the Aſſirians to
puniſh the eaſtern people: <hi>Sennacherib</hi>
was a wicked man, and he is a ſcourge
to wicked people, yea hee cruelly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed
the people of God, hee ſpoileth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> he beſeigeth <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
the cheife Citie of that country:
And thus ſaith God of him by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
in that place: <hi>O A ſhur the rod of
my wrath and the ſtaffe in their hands
is mine indignation: I wil ſend him to a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:25326:21"/>
diſſembling nation, and I will giue
him a charge againſt the people of my
wrath, to take the ſpoile, and to take
the pray, and to treade them vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote
like the mire in the ſtreete. But
he thinketh not ſo, neither doth his
heart eſteeme it ſo:</hi> and ſo forth. And a
little after, thus ſaith God by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
of him: <hi>But when the Lord hath
accompliſhed all his worke vpon
Mount Sion and Ieruſalem, I will viſit
the fruite of the proude heart of the
King of Aſhur, and his glorious and
proud lookes, Becauſe hee ſaid, by the
power of min own hand haue I done
it, and by my wiſdome, becauſe I am
wiſe:</hi> And a little after this, thus ſaith
the Prophet, <hi>Shal the axe boaſt it ſelfe
againſt him that heweth therewith?</hi> If
<hi>Pompey</hi> had looked on this example,
thus laide forth by the Prophet, hee
might haue bene better occupied &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was by his toying with
<hi>Cratippus:</hi> and this would haue
taught him, that thought the Lord ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
tyrantes to bee for a time a
plague to any nation, yet in his appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
time hee ſuffereth them to bee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:25326:22"/>
by other tyrantes, and to haue
the ſame meaſure that they meaſured
vnto others: Now if wee compare
<hi>Sennacherib,</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in this Litle <hi>The greate:</hi> which
name <hi>Silla</hi> gaue him for his victories:
wee ſhall finde many things a like in
their hiſtories. Both of them was an
are in the hand of God to ſtrike the
people of the Eaſt: both of them deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Paleſtina,</hi> and afflicted the people
of God: <hi>Sennacherib</hi> deſeiged Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
<hi>Pompey</hi> tooke it, the <hi>Aſſirian</hi>
was put to flight by an Angel, and was
ſlaine in his temple, that is in his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie,
by his owne Sonnes: <hi>Pompey</hi>
was put to flight by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and flying
to <hi>Ptolomie</hi> King of Egipt, whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being diſpoſſeſſed of his Kingdome,
he had reſtored againe to his crowne, &amp;
therefore <hi>Ptolomie</hi> ſhould haue bene as
a ſonne vnto <hi>Pompey,</hi> was there in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt
with him miſerably ſlaine. So
vnſearchable are the waies of Gods
iudgements: for that which <hi>Michah</hi>
ſpeaketh of the Caldeans in the 4. chap.
of his propheſie: <hi>They know not the
thoughts of the Lord, they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:25326:22"/>
not his counſell, therefore they
ſhall be thraſhed as ſheaues in the
barne,</hi> may be ſpoken of all theſe
Giants and proude tyrantes, who for
that they know not the counſaile of the
Lord, ſhall in his appointed time beare
the puniſhement of their pride: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth the holy Ghoſt teache vs,
that the wicked onely are puniſhed, but
that the Church of God is alſo afflicted
though for another ende and purpoſe:
And there may many reaſons be
brought, to ſhew why the Churche of
God is ſubiect to ſo many calamities,
but I will at this time alleadge onely
three, by which as by many other wee
may know, that the Lord in truth and
iudgement, doth exerciſe his Churche
with afflictions. The firſt is that ſo long
as we cary about with vs this burthen
of corruption, we are not onely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to ſinne, but doe continually by
ſinning prouoke the Lorde to deals
in iuſtice with vs: And therefore
it is agreeable to the iuſtice of God,
that wee bee chaſtened of the Lord
with a fatherly rod, which may kéepe
vs in obedience: yea wee muſt all
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:25326:23"/>
ſay with <hi>Ieremy</hi> in the third chapter of
his Lamentations, verſe 22. <hi>It is the
Lords mercies, that wee are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
becauſe his compaſſions faile
not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My ſeconde reaſon is this: It is
beſt for vs to bee humbled vnder the
mightie hand of God: for wee know
how feirce and haughty minded we are
by nature, ſo that it is neceſſarie for vs,
that God keepe vs vnder his ſchooling,
and ſo haue vs in ſome awe: Therefore
<hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith in the 119. Pſalme, ver. 67.
<hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray:
but now I keepe thy word.</hi> And ver.
71. <hi>It is good for me that I haue bene
afflicted, that I may learne thy ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</hi>
The third reaſon is deliuered by
<hi>Paul</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle to the Corinth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians
the 11. Chapter verſe 32. <hi>When
wee are iudged wee are chaſtned of
the Lord, becauſe wee would not be
condemned with the world:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs conclude this whole diſcourſe
with <hi>Moſes</hi> thus: <hi>The iudgements of
the Lord are true and righteous,
neither let vs meaſure them according
to our own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit &amp; iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:25326:23"/>
are very deceauable,</hi> but let vs know
that the godly are puniſhed for their
ſinnes they dayly commit, that they
may be humbled, and that they periſh
not with the wicked: but God in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
the wicked, doth ſhewe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the treaſures of his long ſufferance,
patience and iuſtice: but when hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficteth
vs, he maketh vs like to his
owne Sonne Chriſt, and ſtirreth vp
in vs an earneſt deſire to be diſſolued
and to be with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Let vs in the meane time giue
our ſelues to harty and
earneſt prayers, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
continually
with the
Saints of
God:</p>
               <p>Come Lord Ieſus, yea come quickly.
Amen. Amen.</p>
