         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Hitherto thoſe Caſes that have been brought into judgment before you, have been the attempts upon the Life of the King, in Inſtances either of Shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Stabbing or Poyſoning: I ſay hitherto they have gone no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to Practiſe theſe things, and that by Popiſh hands, they

This we ſhall prove in the Courſe of our Evidence, to be the deſign of the Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at the Barr. The general deſign hath been opened to you out of the Indictment, to kill and deſtroy the King, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him from his Government; and we ſhall charge him with all thoſe ſeveral Overt Acts, which I ſhall open to you: Firſt ſeveral meetings to conſult about this matter at <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> and ſeveral other places, which My Lord, I think there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to be made, but is an Overt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Act to make High-Treaſon We ſhall go further, and ſhew that theſe deſignes he had to depoſe the King, and raiſe his people againſt him, he does declare openly to Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> which is another Overt-Act within the new Statute. We ſhall My Lord, go further yet, and prove the great Rewards he hath offered to Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> for joyning with him, and being aſſiſting to him in this affair, part in ready mony, and part in Annual Penſion. And there your Lordſhip will find where the Spring is, from whence all theſe miſchiefs ariſe, ſome foreign power, but the Papiſts, the Prieſts are at the bottom of it, they are the Perſons that ſet him on, and theſe muſt draw in a great Perſon beyond Sea, who muſt reward this Gentlemen for being a Partner in this Plot. And we ſhall prove ſome mony paid in hand. But then My Lord, that which was the effect of this Conſult, is the framing this pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Libel, for ſo give me leave to call it.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the Indictment is modeſt, but when you come to hear the Libel it ſelf read, you will find it ſo; and it was not prudence, that ſo Vile a thing ſhould appear upon Record. And truly I believe in a Proteſtant Kingdom 'tis the firſt attempt of this Nature that ever was: For My Lord, it is to defame the whole Royal Family, 'tis to ſtain their Blood, and to make them Vile in the ſight of the whole Kingdom, and of all Poſterity. My Lord, this Libel in its particulars chargeth that moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and Innocent Perſon, our late and never to be forgoten Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, to be the author of the Iriſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; it charges our preſent Prince with the Exerciſe of Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Government, to be a Papiſt, to be a perſon that deprives his Subjects of all manner of Liberty, and Property; in expreſs Terms it charges him with this, than which nothing can be more falſe, for there is none of his Subjects, I think, but muſt ſay that our moſt Gracious Prince, for the time he hath Reigned may Vie with the beſt 20. years of any of his Predeceſſours for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving

               <p>My Lord, when we have gone through the Evidence about the Contexture, and this Libel is read and produced, we ſhall prove the deſign of it, and how it was framed, and the Eyes of the world will be opened, and you will ſee that this was no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no Engine framed to trapan, or enſnare any private Perſon, or as it was ſecretly bruited abroad, to be put in ſuch mens Pockets; but a piece of the greateſt <hi>Machivilian Policy</hi> that ever was inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and prepared for a publick Preſs, as a Catholick Poyſon to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all the Kings Subjects, and excite them one againſt another.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I came acquainted with Mr. <hi>Fitz-Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> beyond Seas, when we both were in the French Kings ſervice, and upon Conference with him of late, eſpecially about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>February</hi> laſt, he renewed his acquaintance, though at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times before we had ſeveral diſcourſes, whereof I did not take much notice; but in thoſe meetings in <hi>February</hi> laſt, and in thoſe Viſits he paid me then, we had ſeveral diſcourſes tending

to repreſent the diſadvantages, and ſufferings I fuſtained for adhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Proteſtant, and Engliſh Intereſt; and beſides comparing in the other Ballance, what advantages I might expect if I would re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate my ſelf into their Intereſt.</p>

               <p>The French, and the Popiſh Intereſt. And there was an Opportunity in my hands, wherein I might be ſervicable to my ſelf and others; and he told me there were ſeveral perſons amongſt whom were ſome Parliament men, that did adhere to the French In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and gave an account to the French Ambaſſador of every daies proceedings; and as I was looked upon to be the Author of a kind of Pamphlet, that was called an anſwer to the Kings Declaration, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> therefore I ſhould be fit to ſerve them, eſpecially to make ſuch another Pamphlet to reflect upon the King, and Alienate him from his people, and his people from him. Whereupon I told him I would do any thing that was for my true Intereſt, but I did conceive with my ſelf, that that was none of it. He appointed a time when we ſhould meet again, but I ſent him a Note, I could not meet poſſibly that day, which was <hi>Munday,</hi> as I remember the 21. of <hi>Februrary:</hi> However he was impatient, and came to me and told me he would give me Heads and inſtructions tending to that Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet I was to write, to Scandalize the King, and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe a Rebellion and Alienate the hearts of the Kingdom, and ſet the people together by the Ears. Upon this he gave me ſome heads by word of mouth: aſſoon as I parted from him, I met with one Mr. <hi>Savile</hi> of <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> and aſſoon as I met with him I acquainted him with what was paſſed, and told him I wiſhed rather than 10l. I had met him ſooner, half an hour before: why what is the occaſion ſaies he? why ſaid I, there is a perſon that hath had ſuch and ſuch diſcourſe with me, and one of his main Errands amongſt others, is for me to write a Scandalous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel reflecting upon his Majeſty, and the Goverment. And upon this I ſaid, Mr. <hi>Savile,</hi> I ſhall not confer with him any further, unleſs I have ſome body by to witneſs what he ſaies, he ſpeaks moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly French, and ſometimes Engliſh; and therefore it muſt be one who underſtands both the Tongues well. So we went into the City together that afternoon to one Mr. <hi>Crows,</hi> who is a ſilkman in Queen-ſtreet; ſaid we Sir, you are a moderate impartial man, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand French, we deſire you will be preſent to over-hear ſome propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals that are made to me tending to ſet our Country together by the Ears, and he comes from a Popiſh party. Mr. <hi>Crow</hi> ſaid he would be willing to undertake any thing to ſerve the Proteſtant Engliſh Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, but he would not undertake to ſpeak French ſo well as to be able to underſtand all nice paſſages, and words that might be propoſed. And then Mr. <hi>Savile</hi> and I went to Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> a <hi>Durham</hi> Gentleman, and made him the ſame propoſal, I had made to Mr. <hi>Crow,</hi> deſiring him that he would come and over-hear our diſcourſe, and I would place him in a fit place. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> aſſented to the propoſitions, and ſaid he would. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> asked me what day and time we were to meet; I told him to morrow at 6 or 7 a Clock at night at my Chamber in <hi>Graies-Inn;</hi> but further he ſaid we muſt have other witneſſes, for one witneſs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102574:9"/>
would not be ſufficient; ſo we went to the <hi>Exchange Coffee houſe,</hi> and there we met with Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> to whom we made the ſame propoſal, that ſince we muſt have ſome that underſtood French and keep the thing ſecret, till it were time to have it come out, he would pleaſe to undertake it: Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> promiſed to come, but failed that firſt meeting, which was to be on the <hi>Tueſday;</hi> then we went to another French Merchant, who was propoſed by Mr. <hi>Savile,</hi> but he was not within; ſo then we muſt rely upon one witneſs for that meeting. Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was to meet me about 2 a Clock at my Chamber in <hi>Graies-Inn,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> and Mr. <hi>Savile</hi> were to meet likewiſe, and they came firſt to the Tavern juſt at the Corner of <hi>Fullers Rents,</hi> which hath a proſpect into the Court: And from thence I ſaw Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> in the Court pointing to another Gentleman that was with him, up to my Chamber, and he was walking ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly up and down. Then I went out of the Tavern, and came up to my Chamber, and after a little while Captain <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> came up to my Room, I placed him in another Room, where my Wife was, and ſhut the door to whilſt I ſent word to Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> to come into the outer Room, and ſhut himſelf into my Cloſet. There was Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> in the Cloſet, and there was an hole or two for the purpoſe made through both the Planks of the boards, and the hanging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings hung over the hole that it might not be diſcerned by Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> and he could raiſe it and then ſee who was in the Room and hear their words; for I placed my Chair towards the Cloſet which had an angle outwards, and now and then I did ſtand againſt the whole, and now and then ſate to give Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> advantage, and to give Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> no ſuſpition. When we were ſo placed Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> asked me what I had done as to the thing propoſed, this Libel that I was to draw up; I ſaid I was buſie, and had not been able to finiſh it, but here are ſome heads of it ſaid I, and ſhewed him half a Dozen Lines drawn up together; and when I had read them, Sir ſaid I, is this your mind? yes ſaid he, but I muſt add much more than this is to it. Then Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> proceeded to give me further inſtructions; and ſo repeated what inſtructions he had given me before, that the King and all the Royal Family muſt be traduced to be Popiſhly, and Arbitrarily inclined from the beginning, that King Charles the Firſt eſpecially had an hand in the Iriſh Rebellion, and that likewiſe King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, that now is, did countenance the ſame, as did appear by bis promoting thoſe very officers that were in the Iriſh Rebellion, <hi>Fitz-Girald, Fitz-Patrick,</hi> and <hi>Mont-Garrat,</hi> which ſhould be named in the Libel. Beſides that, the Act made at the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, forbidding any to call the King Papiſt, was meerly to ſtop peoples mouths that they ſhould not call him a Papiſt, when he ſhould incline to further Popery, and did intend by his actions ſo to do. And beſides his adhering ſo cloſely to the Duke of <hi>Yorks</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, was to be another argument of it, his hindering the D. of <hi>York</hi> from coming to his Tryal, and to be proceeded againſt by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hindering the Officers that were put in by the D. of <hi>York,</hi> from being caſt out: Another argument was becauſe thoſe Privy Counſellors and Juſtices of the Peace, that did adhere to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102574:9"/>
Intereſt were turned out of all places of Truſt; and beſides he ſaid it did appear to the people conſequently, that the King was Conſcious to himſelf, that he was as Guilty as his brother, and was as much a Papiſt as his brother, and it was in the peoples power as well to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a preſent Popiſh Poſſeſſor, as a Popiſh Succeſſor, and that the people muſt be ſtirred up againſt him, and incouraged to blow the Trumpet, and eſpecially that the City, and Common Council muſt be incouraged to ſtand by the Parliament; and ſeeing the King was ſuch that no hopes was to be had of the Parliament at <hi>Oxon,</hi> they were bound to provide for themſelves, and to advance ſome hundreds or thouſands of pounds to the Parliament to ſettle the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion without the King, if Parliamentary waies would not ſucceed. Theſe were ſome of the inſtructions.</p>

He then deſired to know of me when the Scheme of this thing would be ready; ſaid I, you may come to morrow; I will ſaies he, come about 6 or 7 a Clock in the Evening. In the mean time I writ a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> in French, which I ſent by a Porter, and therein I ſaid, Sir you have miſſed a great opportunity of rendring a great ſervice to the King, by not coming to ſee me when you were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; for the perſon, the French Emiſſary whom I ſpoke of to you, hath propoſed very Scandalous S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> received my Letter and came thither accordingly, I placed Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> in another Room, and I placed my own Chair at a narrow Table near the place where Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> was, and there through the Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcot and Hangings, we made a ſlit, whereby Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> might ſee into the next Room where Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> and I ſate; but before I placed him there I ſhewed Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> two Copies of the inſtructions for the Libel drawn up: ſaid I, Sir, here are 2 Copies which are both the ſame, and I deſire you to counter mark them, that you may know them again, and thereby ſee what alteration will be made; for here are no Blots now, and by that you will find the alteration.

I went into the next Room, and I had not been long there, but Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> came in, I placed the Table near the Alcove, where Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> was within his hearing and ſeeing. Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> asked me what I had done in the buſineſs: Sir ſaid I, here are 2 Copies of it, pray will you ſee how you like it. So he took one and I took the other.</p>

               <p>Look you Gent. if you will attend the Court we will give you what ſatisfaction we can, pray Mr. <hi>Solicitor</hi> give them leave to ſpeak to the Court; what you deſire Gent. is reaſonable enough, that you may hear the Libel to ſee whether theſe are not Clauſes taken out of a Paper which may have another Import in the Paper than they have when they are taken out.

Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> does not deſire to ſee whether Mr. <hi>Aſtrey</hi> read right, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe Clauſes in the Indictment are of the ſame import in the Indictment that they are of in the Libel. Therefore they muſt have a Copy of the Indictment whilſt Mr. <hi>Aſtrey</hi> reads the Libel, and Mr. <hi>Aſtrey</hi> pray mark thoſe Clauſes when you come to them, for you will find they are diſperſed up and down the Libel.</p>

               <p>My Lord, after this buſineſs was talked of abroad having heard that Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> and <hi>Everard</hi> had made the Diſcovery, I did Diſcourſe Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> about the buſineſs, and about the Libel. He told me he wrote the Libel, and when I would not believe it the man was a little angry that I would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. And then I told him he was a man very unfortunate in ſpeaking; for he ſpoke but badly; he ſaid though he was unfortunate in his Tongue, yet he was as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in his Pen, and that he took a great deal out of the intercepted Letter to <hi>Roger Le'Strange,</hi> and I then asked him what the Deſign of it was, he told me it was to be Printed, and to be ſent about by the <hi>Penny Poſt</hi> to the proteſting Lords, and the Leading men in the Houſe of Commons, and they were to be taken up as ſoon as they had it, and to be Searched, and to have it found about them. I then asked him if there were any other Perſons concerned in it beſides thoſe publickly talked of, he told me the Court had an hand in it, and the King had given <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> Money already, and would give him more if it had ſucceſs. This he told me at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and before he went thither, and after.</p>

               <p>That which I heard Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> ſay, was this; I had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak with Sir <hi>James Hayes,</hi> and enquiring for him, I found he was at the Dog Tavern; ſo I went up, and found in the Company, Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and another Gentleman one Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> and ſome more. After the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were gone, and only Sir <hi>James Hayes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> my ſelf, and Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> left, Sir <hi>William</hi> was giving an account of this Buſineſs, and ſaid, The King, when I had acquainted him with it, told me I had done him the greateſt piece of Service that ever I had done him in my life; and gave me a great many Thanks. But I was no ſooner gone from thence, but two worthy Gentlemen gave me an account, that the King ſaid, I had broken all his Meaſures, and he would have me taken off one way or another.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I would rather I had loſt my hearing for that time, than have heard it to repeat it. Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> did tell me, at the Dog Tavern, where was Sir <hi>James Hayes</hi> and Col. <hi>Manſell</hi> by, after he had read over the Libel to us, there was a great deal of Company more, but he only gave us the curioſity to ſee what the Libel was. And when he had read it, he did tell us, That the King gave him particular Thanks for that good ſervice he had done him in detecting <hi>Fitz Harris;</hi> but he ſaid he was told by two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that had heard the King ſpeak it, who were of undoubted credit, That the King was in an extream paſſion, beſtowed many hard Names on him, and ſaid, He would give any thing in the World to take him out of the World; that he was an inſufferable vexation to him, and that he had broken all his Meaſures. And he ſaid the ſame things again, in the preſence of Sir <hi>Philip Harcourt,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Radnor</hi>'s Son Mr. <hi>Roberts,</hi> at Capt. <hi>Hall</hi>'s Chamber, in <hi>Pembrook</hi> College in <hi>Oxon.</hi>

And he ſaid further, (for I am a Witneſs here, and muſt ſpeak all my knowledg) that he had another Plot which he had traced near to a full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, a more horrid Plot than this or <hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s, for, he ſaid, this was the Counter-part of <hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s Plot.

And you, Mr. <hi>Fitz-harris,</hi> did once tell me, You could bring in Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the King's Intereſt, that were very conſiderable. So I ſpoke to the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State about you, that there was one that had been with me, and told me, that he could bring in thoſe to the King and Duke's Intereſt that were very conſiderable. The Secretary of State deſired me to know who they were; and then he named to me one <hi>Thomas Merrey,</hi> and another Perſon who I deſire to be excuſed from naming. The other Party he did name, was thought conſiderable, both for Quality and Underſtanding. And the Secretary deſired me to get him in if I could.</p>

He told me, theſe Perſons were conſiderable for the King's Intereſt, and could do him extraordinary good Service. So, as I ſaid, I ſpoke to the Secretary of State; and he would know who they were. And when he was told who they were, as for one of them, <hi>Thomas Merrey,</hi> he was not thought worth the looking after, for he was thought an inconſiderable Raſcal; but as for the other Gentleman, he was thought a Man of Worth, and a Perſon, that if he would, could really ſerve the King. Upon this, when you firſt came, I was never at reſt for you; and therefore, after a while, before you came again, I gave the Porter order to tell you, I was not at home; and I deſire the Porter may be asked the Queſtion. But when I next ſaw the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, I deſired that he would give them a poſitive Anſwer, one way or the other; and the next time I ſaw you, this was your Buſineſs, and I told the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of Sate of it. You gave me this Paper, and deſired me to ſollicit for your Quit-Rent in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for you were in great miſery, and had been a great

I was 4, if not 6 months a getting this mony.</p>

               <p>Sir, I ſhall anſwer as particularly as I can all your Queſtions; but it will be neceſſary to introduce my Evidence with the Relation of the whole Tranſaction. You know, about <hi>October</hi> laſt, about the beginning of the month, for it was, as I take it, ten days, or a fortnight, before the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>itting down of the Parliament, You did make Applications to me, in the Name of the King, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with or without his privity I cannot ſay; but you did make ſeveral invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to me, of putting my ſelf into the poſſeſſion of an Honour I was altogether unworthy of, of waiting upon the King. I gave you my Reaſons why I thought my ſelf unfit for that Honour, becauſe I was not in any capacity of doing the King any Service: And I looked upon the King as a Perſon too Sacred, and whoſe Time was too precious to be trifled away upon one that had nothing to offer to Him, and therefore I refuſed it. But notwithſtanding this, was rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by you; and when I ſtill perſiſted in the denial of that which was an Honour I ought rather to have ſought, but only becauſe I thought my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102574:19"/>
of deſerving it. After ſeveral Applications, I did at laſt tell you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the impertinency of it, I did alſo apprehend it might be the occaſion of ſome indecency; for perhaps I might thereby put my ſelf upon d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then you did lower it, and ſaid, It ſhould ſuffice, if I would wait upon the Dutcheſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In ſhort, you did reſolve it into this, That you did find the King under great app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But when <hi>I</hi> came there, <hi>I</hi> was ſurprized with a greater Honour of finding the King there, and <hi>I</hi> think it was an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, wherein my time was not ill ſpent as to my ſelf, but <hi>I</hi> am afraid this 250 <hi>l.</hi> if it were given for the bringing me thither, his Majeſty doth not think he hath deſerved it at this time.</p>

               <p>My Lord, did not <hi>I</hi> come to you with a Meſſage, the night before my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was condemned?</p>

               <p>You ſay right, and it was in my thoughts, and yet I thought it too tender a thing to ſpeak of; and therefore I thought it ſo, becauſe, I muſt confeſs, at that time (you muſt excuſe me) I did believe you did not come with that Authority you pretended to make uſe of. After the time that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Lord had had his Trial, and the Houſe were preparing their thoughts for the ſentence, I was indiſpoſed, and came not to the Houſe that day; which provoked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Houſe ſo much, that they were near committing me to the <hi>Tower;</hi> but truly I was ſo ill in Body, and had ſo little a mind to have my Vote mixed with his Blood, that perhaps I ſhould have run the hazard of going to the <hi>Tower</hi> about it, if that had been all. But the night before you came to me, and told me, as a great Secret, That you did bring it as the deſire of the King, and as that which he would take as a great inſtance of my reſignation to his Will and Pleaſure, and that for which I might promiſe my ſelf all the greateſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes poſſible for a Prince to ſhew to his Subjects, if I would go the next day and give my Vote for my Lord Stafford. Sir, ſaid I, I have all the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Nature and Blood to diſpoſe me, as much as can be, to favour my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> as far as can conſiſt with the integrity and ſincerity of a Judg; but though I was wavering in my own Thoughts the day before, now by the Grace of God I will go, though <hi>I</hi> be carried on Mens backs to the Houſe. Now <hi>I</hi> ſee there is ſo great an account put upon it, for <hi>I</hi> ſee 'tis the Concerns, not only of my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> but the Proteſtant Cauſe; and then, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> If all the Relations <hi>I</hi> have were melted down into my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> if <hi>I</hi> had but breath enough to pronounce his Doom, he ſhall die.</p>

There we drank a Bottle or two of Wine together, and then we parted. As ſoon as I came home, I heard this Gentleman was ſeized on, and taken, which ſurprized me much. And this is all the account I can give of the Matter.</p>

               <p>No Meſſage at all; but I'le tell you what I know.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mrs. <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> ſoon after her Husband came to be cloſe confined, delivered a Petition to the King in the Park; and the King was pleaſed to give it to me, as he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently does. Mrs. <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> came to me to tell her what the King ſaid to it. Said I, the King hath given me no commands at all in it, but this, Carry it to the Secretary of State, for <hi>I</hi> cannot ſay any thing to it. For the King general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells me what he will have done with ſuch a Petition. But ſhe was ſo very importunate, I asked the King again; Sir, ſaid I, Mrs. <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate what is Your Majeſty's Pleaſure in it. Said the King, If ſhe have a mind to Petition the Council, ſhe may, <hi>I</hi> will neither meddle nor make with it. Afterwards <hi>I</hi> met her ſeveral times, and ſhe ſaid, her Husband was very
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102574:22"/>
ſeverely and hardly uſed, and ſhe was denied the liberty of coming to him Said <hi>I, I</hi> hear he is guilty of a very foul Thing, and there is no way to help him, but by diſcovering the Author of that villanous Libel. For ſhe asked me, what <hi>I</hi> thought of her Husband; and ſhe told me, ſhe intended to try what ſhe could do for him. <hi>I</hi> ſaid there was no way to do any good, but to make a full diſcovery of the Author. Then, ſaid ſhe, if the King would but let me ſpeak with him, <hi>I</hi> am ſure <hi>I</hi> could do him ſervice, and prevail with him to diſcover the Author. So <hi>I</hi> told the King of it; and the King ſaid, If ſhe will come and be examined, with all my Heart. And as ſoon as ever <hi>I</hi> heard ſhe was come to Town, <hi>I</hi> told her what the King ſaid: And ſhe told me ſhe would willingly come; and if the King would give her leave to ſpeak with her Husband, ſhe did not doubt to prevail with him. That night, about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, after <hi>I</hi> was in Bed, and had been in Bed two hours, ſhe came to my door and knocked me up. So <hi>I</hi> roſe, and put on my Night-gown, and went down, and <hi>I</hi> heard a Voice which <hi>I</hi> thought was hers. So ſhe came out of the Coach to me, and told me, ſaid ſhe, <hi>I</hi> am come to you to beg of you, that you would be ſecret, and not to let the Court know that <hi>I</hi> was to come to have any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with you, for if you do, <hi>I</hi> am undone and ruined, for there are ſome Perſons, my Friends, that will not look upon me if they hear any ſuch thing. The next morning <hi>I</hi> went to her, and told her, the King had directed ſhe ſhould be examined in the Afternoon, and ſhe ſhould come down to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: Which ſhe did; and as ſoon as the Council was up, <hi>I</hi> told his Majeſty ſhe was below. So he ordered ſome to examine her; but when <hi>I</hi> told her of it, ſaid ſhe, If the King will not ſpeak alone with me, <hi>I</hi> will not ſpeak a word, nor be examined. This is the truth of it, <hi>I</hi> aſſure you, my Lord, upon my Salvation.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fitzharris.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, I have ſomething further to offer for my ſelf: I will tell you what I know, ſince my Witneſſes will not do me juſtice. Gentlemen of the Jurie, you are my Judges in point of Law as well as Fact, and my Bloud will be required at your hands, if you do not do me right. My Lord, I cannot forbear complaining to the Court of the hard uſage I received in Priſon, contrary to the Statute of the 31th of his Majeſties Reign; greater oppreſſion hath been done to me than to any before: my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoign,</hi> and others, had all the libertie they could deſire, to enable them to make their defence againſt their Trial; which I have had denied me. But my defence conſiſts of two heads, and I ſhall relie upon the Conſciences of the Jurie for the iſſue: though my Lady <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Wall,</hi> and the reſt, are pleaſed to ſay, that I was not employed, nor received money for ſecret ſervices, yet 'tis very well known I did ſo.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As to Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> when I met with him, though now he hath made it a French ſtorie, yet if he would tell the truth, he knows that it was otherwiſe: he told me he was well acquainted with my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> and in ſeveral Clubs of the Citie he knew all their Intrigues; and that Speech that went by the name of my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s, my Lord gave it him before it was printed, and he ſeveral other things of that kind. So then I told him, it was a buſineſs of the greateſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that could be, if he would continue thoſe Diſcoveries. And whereas he ſays, I would betray the People to the French Intereſt, it is very well known I was always an Enemie to the French Intereſt; but I humoured him in his diſcourſe, and diſcourſed him to reduce the Paper that he accuſes me of under ſome heads; and that Paper I no ſooner had, but I came to <hi>Whitehal</hi> with it: And though he ſaid he was to have fortie Guinnies, and ſo ſaid Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> too, yet it was onely fortie ſhillings that he deſired for his povertie I would lend him. And as to what he talks of three thouſand Crowns Penſion, it is a very unlikely buſineſs. When I came to <hi>Whitehal,</hi> I was adviſed to go to my Lord <hi>Clarendon,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Hide.</hi> Accordingly I did ſhew it to a Gentleman who was to give it to my Lord <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but before he could get to him, I was taken. Now, my Lord, I hope what I did was with a deſigne to ſerve the King in diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was deſigned againſt him, according as I was employed, though both the Secretaries are ſo unkind as not to declare it; when I know I am in the right, I am not aſhamed to ſpeak it, though my life be loſed upon it, and I refer it to the Gentlemen of the Jurie: I was taken before I could come to the ſpeech of my Lord <hi>Clarendon.</hi> Next, I hope, Gentlemen of the Jurie, you will conſider theſe are great Perſons that I have to do with; and where great State-matters are at the bottom, it is hard to make them tell any thing but what is for their advantage: and ſo I am left in a ſad condition. But, my

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102574:24"/>
Lord, in the next place, I think 'tis impoſſible for any Jurie to find me guiltie, without prejudging of thoſe Laws which are not to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any Jurie or inferiour Court: for if they judge me and bring me in guiltie, 'tis murder in them; and let the Bench tell them what they will, 'tis of that dang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rous conſequence, that it overthrows the Government. My Lord, here is the Impeachment of the Houſe of Commons, and here is a Copie of the Votes of the Commons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; and though they be not Laws, yet they are ſuch Declarations of the Parliament, as that afterwards no other Court ought to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with that matter; and the inferiour Courts do not uſe to meddle with Parliament-matters: and ſo, Gentlemen, you will lay at your own doors what would lie at theirs, if you meddled not. For though the Court have over-ruled my Plea, yet the matter is plain before you now who are my Judges, and my Bloud will lie at your doors, and you muſt anſwer it if you do me not juſtice. And there is no inſufficiencie of a Plea, as to matter of Law, will excuſe you in point of Fact; and you are obliged, as you will anſwer the contrarie to God and your Conſciences, to do me right. And I hope your Lordſhip and the Jurie will take particular notice of this: I have been a cloſe Priſoner and had no manner of help, nothing at all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me to refreſh my memorie; which if I had had means to do as I ought, I could ſay a great deal more: But this I inſiſt upon, If the Gentlemen of the Jurie do bring me in guiltie and convict me, they do ſhed my Bloud, and overthrow the Law and courſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Whereas if they bring me in not guiltie, my Impeachment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <speaker>Mr. Soll. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, you have heard our Evidence, and what the Priſoner hath ſaid. The Crime for which he is accuſed, that is High-Treaſon, and 'tis Treaſon in conſpiring the death of the King, in endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to raiſe Rebellion here, and that in order to deſtroy the King and the Liberty of all the People, and bring them under the ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the King of <hi>France.</hi> This is the Treaſon he was indicted for; and the proof of this Treaſon is very full; it is proved to you by three poſitive Witneſſes, and all men of credit, of whom you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102574:24"/>
have the leaſt ſuſpition. They prove to you, that Mr. <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> is the man guilty of this Treaſon; he was the contriver of it, he was the mover of it firſt to Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> and he gave him thoſe inſtructions to purſue thoſe purpoſes of raiſing a Rebellion here, in order to deſtroy the King, by contriving a ſeditious Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet to ſet the people together by the ears; and he came to him in order to perfect this Libel. This is proved by <hi>Everard,</hi> who upon the firſt motion of it to him, did acquaint Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> immediately and Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> that ſuch a deſign was on foot, and deſired them to come and be Witneſſes of it. They both came, and heard the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between the Priſoner and Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> to contrive ſuch a Libel as hath been opened to you, and they ſwear it poſitively. Now what defence does the Priſoner make to it? Truely I cannot ſay whether it have more of folly or impudence in it; for 'tis a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a ſtrange nature, for it is inconſiſtent with it ſelf, and ſhews what a make he is of; and the latter part is a purſuing the ſame Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he ſtands indicted for, which is the rendring the King odious to his people, by thoſe inſinuations that he did this by the Kings order. The firſt part of his Defence is, I am not guilty, for Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> is the man that did contrive it, and he is the Author, and it moves from him. Now pray conſider the parts of your Evidence, and ſee if there be any poſſibilitie for you to be induced to believe any thing like it. 'Tis proved by Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> poſitively, that he came to him firſt; and when you conſider this Objection that is made by Mr. <hi>Fitz-harris,</hi> and conſider on the other ſide who were the Witneſſes, and who is the man that makes the Objection, you will then ſee no cauſe in the world for you to give any credit to it. The Priſoner ſays he was trepan'd into it; for that, pray conſider he is an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſt, one that hath all along made it his buſineſs to defame the proceedings about the Popiſh Plot, to ridicule it, to deny that there was ever any ſuch thing, and to laugh at the Juſtice that was executed upon the Popiſh Offenders who died for the Plot. The Witneſſes that prove it againſt him have been zealous proſecutors of the Plot, men that have diſcovered many of thoſe who were guilty of it, and brought them to Juſtice; men that have been mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Evidences upon the diſcoverie. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> is a man that ſpoke materially in the Trial of my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> and for which ſervice, I believe, the Papiſts, and Mr. <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> himſelf, owe him little thanks. As for Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> all men know how buſie and active he hath been to bring in men that were guilty of the Plot, and he hath ſuffered for it. Now if you can believe that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> and Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> ſhould be guilty of a Trepan that was to be put upon <hi>Fitz-harris,</hi> a man of that perſwaſion you hear of, (and you muſt believe that, or you cannot believe the defence the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner makes) I leave it to you. Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> could do nothing alone, why then Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> muſt be guilty of this contrivance, and of ſetting of <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> on work and <hi>Everard</hi> too: But this is ſo unlikely a ſtorie, that if there were any to aſſert any ſuch thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you could not poſſibly give any credit to it. But when you conſider what hath been proved, and what hath been ſhewed you
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102574:25"/>
under the hand of <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> himſelf, then there is no room I am ſure to doubt. They do poſitively ſwear, both <hi>Smith</hi> and Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Waller,</hi> they heard him own that he had given inſtructions to <hi>Everard.</hi> They prove to you that he mended this Libel in ſeveral places, they not coming up to the Inſtructions he had before given. They prove part of the Libel written with his own hand, and that is Treaſon enough; for that is certainly Treaſon, That 'tis the undoubted right of the people to dethrone the King. I never heard of that doctrine any where but among the Papiſts, and 'tis a Papiſt that preaches that Doctrine to you now. As this is an Evidence in a matter beyond any contradiction in the world, his own hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of part, and his owning the giving the Inſtructions; ſo there is no room in the world for you to believe that ever he was drawn into this by <hi>Everard;</hi> or that he was the man that was the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Contriver of it, and trepan'd him into it. But it appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the proof, that it moved originally from <hi>Fitz-harris;</hi> that it was the malice of his heart that promoted it; and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance was how to raiſe a Rebellion here. For when he had read part of the Libel, and <hi>Everard</hi> told him that it was Treaſon, why, ſaid he, I meant it ſo; and the more Treaſon, the better; the more odious you make the King to be, the more likely 'tis to raiſe the people into a Rebellion; and the ſooner you raiſe the people into a Rebellion, the more like you are to accompliſh the deſign of bringing the people into ſlavery to the <hi>French</hi> King, and ſo at once to deſtroy all Libertie and Propertie, and all that is ſacred. No body can believe but Mr. <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> is guilty of this Libel and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to dethrone the King, and raiſe a Rebellion here, as the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes have ſworn. Now as you cannot poſſibly doubt but this moves from Mr. <hi>Fitz harris,</hi> ſo then conſider the inconſiſtencie of the ſecond part of his Defence, and the impudency of it too. For as before he pretended he was drawn into it by Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> ſo now he would make you believe he did not do it out of a traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſigne, for that he was employed about theſe affairs; and this comes under the Title of Secret Service; and he would fain have it that you ſhould believe the King ſhould hire him to raiſe a Rebellion againſt himſelf, to defame himſelf, and to incenſe the minds of the people againſt him. And this muſt be the ſervice that he is put upon; he had no traiterous intent in himſelf, but he was to trepan all the Lords that ſtood zealouſly up for the Proteſtant Religion and Property, and that by direction from whom? from the King, whom <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> would have all people to believe to be a Papiſt; and he would have people believe that he is an innocent man, that he was onely employed upon ſuch a ſpecial piece of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; that the King ſhould be at great pains to employ Mr. <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> to deſtroy himſelf and the whole Nation, and to ſtain his whole Family; and upon what reaſons would he have you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live it? As firſt, you obſerved how inconſiſtent it is with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of his defence, that he was trepann'd into it; now he did not do it from Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> nor with a treaſonable intention. But certainly this is a Treaſon that nothing can be ſaid to palliate or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102574:25"/>
and I am ſure he hath ſaid nothing will do it. Yet all the defence he hath made has tended that way: for though he have not arrived to the confidence to ſay ſuch a thing is, yet he hath inſinuated by the method of his proceedings, that he would fain have ſuch a thing believed, and that the man had no traiterous deſigne in it. Now what Evidence hath he produced for it? He hath produced to you Evidence that he hath had money from the King, and hath been ſometimes at the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth</hi>'s. That he had money from the King is true, but it little became him to mention it, for it was charity to relieve a man in neceſſity that was ready to ſtarve, and was forced to go all the ways to work he could to move com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; he urged the ſufferings of his Wives Father; you heard the Petition read as a ground for ſupply; and he hath ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon the Kings Charity (which he hath abuſed) as to have a ſum of money given him, and he hath had the benefit of it; but he hath made a very ill return for it; for the thanks he hath given to the King for this his Charity, is to flie in the face of him, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, and the Government: he hath endeavoured to raiſe a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and when he is brought to his Trial, he continues to defame the King, which is an aggravation of his Treaſon if poſſible. And now having no proof in the world for theſe malicious inſinuations, and all the Witneſſes that he hath called to make out what he would fain have believed, and dares not mention, (not proving any ſuch thing) you will have little reaſon, Gentlemen, to believe any thing that comes from him, eſpecially if you conſider the nature of the Libel it ſelf, it is impoſſible this man ſhould ever be ſet on work to contrive ſuch a thing as this, to defame the King and all his Family, to raiſe a Rebellion, to overthrow all Religion, Liberty, and the King himſelf; it is impoſſible to be believed. But I fear I preſs too much upon you, as if I did ſuſpect there could be men in this Kingdom ſo bad as to believe ſuch a malicious inſinuation. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, I leave it to you; you hear what our Evidence is, three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that poſitively ſwear this Treaſon againſt the Priſoner. Now as you have this poſitive Evidence on the one ſide, ſo you have no colour of Evidence to the contrary; and 'tis impoſſible for you not to find him guilty. It is to deny the light of the day; and 'tis a thing of that conſequence, that all Ages, when they hear of it, will ſay that there is no Juſtice to be had, if an Engliſh Jury do not find a Verdict according to their Evidence. For what ſecurity hath a man for his Life and Eſtate, if twelve ſubſtantial men of a Jury ſhall dare to go againſt plain and full Evidence? 'Tis all the ſecurity an Engliſh-man has, for all he enjoys, that he is to paſs through the hands of twelve honeſt men of his own Country. And if it be poſſible for a Jury to go againſt Evidence ſo plain as this is, I ſay, no man is ſafe in his Life or Eſtate.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, I deſire to take notice of what Mr. <hi>Fitzharris</hi> was pleaſed to conclude withal. He ſays, his Bloud is to be required at your hands; and therefore he would fain by that means inſinuate you out of your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>onſciences. But I think if you conſider the circumſtances that have been given, and all the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102574:26"/>
it will be impoſſible for men that have any reſpect to their Credit and their Conſciences, to acquit this Gentleman. In the firſt place, it is known, and it hath been given in proof to induce the probabilitie of the matter evidenced againſt the Priſoner at the Bar, that he is a known Roman Catholick; they are all Proteſtants, and good Proteſtants; and you are all Proteſtants too. And then the caſe goes thus far further; You that are Proteſtants muſt take it upon your Oaths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that theſe Gentlemen have ſworn falſe, and convict them of wilful Perjurie; and if you do convict them, it muſt be upon the bare Allegation of a Papiſt: And I hope never to live to ſee the day that men that are of good Credit, and Proteſtants, ſhall by an Allegation (though never ſo confidently affirmed at the Bar) be preſumed to be guiltie of Perjurie. So that I ſay, my Lord, beſides the baſeneſs and venome of this impudent Libel, which certainly no honeſt man in the world will give the leaſt countenance to, here is Evidence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from himſelf; and you cannot believe it proceeds from any direction from the Crown (as this man would inſinuate,) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath given us the greateſt Evidence by his libelling at the Bar: and he hath not onely libelled the Crown, but he hath called up ſome Witneſſes on purpoſe to libel the reſt of his own. And then I hope you will take notice how he did inſinuate with Mr. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi> at the beginning; When you were in the <hi>French</hi> King's ſervice, ſaid he, and have been neglected ever ſince you left it: If you will come and joyn with me, without peradventure you may get encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement fitter than that poor and mean way that you are reduced to by embracing the Proteſtant Intereſt. He gives him a method likewiſe to walk by: he thought him the perſon that had writ ſome Pamphlets before, and therefore was fit for his purpoſe, and ought to be encouraged. And he does tell you the words not onely againſt the preſent Government, but that which every good Proteſtant muſt needs abhor and tremble at; he bids him take care to libel the whole Familie. He tells him withal, You muſt be ſure to ſay that the late King of bleſſed memorie was concerned even in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion; and that this King hath promoted thoſe perſons that his Father had countenanced for that Action: and he tells him the names of thoſe perſons that were ſo promoted. After this is done, what does Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> do? he goes and makes a Diſcoverie: He tells the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and the perſons, to whom, when: And the perſons he made that Diſcoverie to, do in every circumſtance agree with time, place, and all. The firſt night this appointment was, I hope you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that when Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> had ſo placed that Gentleman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom there is not the leaſt word ſaid or imagined to finde fault with him, he takes notice of the Inſtructions; owns that he had given him inſtructions; and takes particular notice of one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, That when Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> ſaid, But there may be danger in them, is not this Treaſon? the Priſoner made anſwer, The more Treaſon the better. Aye, but then this is dangerous, how ſhall I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon ſuch matters? Why have you not my hand in it? I am as guiltie as you, and in as much danger. What then was the Reward? there was to be at preſent fortie Guinnies, and an annual Penſion; but to whom was Mr. <hi>Fitzharris</hi> to diſcover this? not to the King,

All this was done, which is plainly ſworn by Witneſs that had a place made a purpoſe for him to over-hear all that paſſed. And, my Lord, for the next Witneſs there is Sir <hi>William Waller;</hi> there is this, beſides what is ſworn, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in circumſtance: He tells you both, to their very Money, that it was fortie ſomewhat, but he cannot ſay Guinnies; and he tells you ſomething of the Penſion, a great many thouſand Crowns; and he tells you particularly of that circumſtance of the <hi>French</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor and the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour. Beſides all this, does not Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> tell you this very thing, That he eſpi'd him with a Pen and Ink, that he gave a Note of the Libel it ſelf, and he heard him give the directions? and when he came into the Room, he ſaw the Ink freſh upon the Paper; and when he heard him give dire<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctions for the alteration of particular words, he ſaid, You have not worded it according to my mind in ſuch and ſuch particular places. But, my Lord, there is this Venome in it further to be taken notice of, That he gave his inſtructions to draw it ſo, as that it might beſt take effect according to his intention: for when Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> thought it might do well to make it with <hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee,</hi> as though it ſhould be the deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the Gentlemen of the Jury will not forget what Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> ſaid, That <hi>Fitzharris</hi> did ſay, I have taken care already to diſperſe abundance of Libels amongſt our Partie: And when <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi> told him of a Libel that was ſome while before, he ſaid, He had ſeen that a great while ago, and there might be ſomewhat in it to the purpoſe. And for the Anſwer that hath been given to it, my Lord, I think it does not bear any ſort of relation to the Charge that is upon him: for whatſoever diſcourſe, or whatſoever he hath urged, is not much to his purpoſe. He hath brought here a Noble-man; but after all, I would put him in mind of one thing that Noble-man ſaid, He did believe he came to him in the name of one that ſent him not: and ſo will every body ſay that hath heard the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for all his Witneſſes do poſitively deny that they ever knew of any ſuch matters as he ſpeaks of. And now, my Lord, I could be very glad if this Gentleman (inſtead of ſaying as he hath ſaid) would have come as ſoon as he had this Libel from <hi>Everard,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it immediately to ſome-body himſelf before he had carried it on, as <hi>Everard</hi> did before the thing was perfected. And ſo, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, we do think upon this Evidence we have left you without all manner of excuſe, it being impoſſible, upon ſuch a proof as this is: and conſidering the nature and venome of the Libel it ſelf, the baſe venomous malicious inſtigations he made uſe of to effect it, and the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102574:27"/>
ends for which it was done, to bring in the <hi>French</hi> to ſet us together by the ears, to render the King odious to his People; and the perſon 'tis acted by, a known <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſt; I cannot doubt of the iſſue: and I do hope when I ſee ſo many honeſt Gentlemen and Proteſtants at the Bar, they will be loth to forfeit their own Souls to eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to ſave a man that is guiltie of ſuch a Treaſon as this.</p>

               <p>Then look you, Gentlemen of the Jurie; Here is Mr. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harris</hi> indicted for Treaſon againſt the King, and 'tis for endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to take away his life, to make him odious to his Subjects, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them to a Rebellion, and to raiſe Arms here in this Kingdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our King our Soveraign. And by the Indictment it is ſaid that he hath declared theſe Endeavours and theſe Intentions, by cauſing a ſcandalous and evil Pamphlet or Libel to be written, with an intent to be diſperſed through the Kingdom. The words of the Libel you have heard particularly read; ſome of them are taken out and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this Indictment. Mr. <hi>Fitzharris</hi> hath been arraigned, and hath pleaded Not guiltie; and you are to trie the ſingle matter before you, whether Mr. <hi>Fitzharris</hi> be guiltie of this Treaſon. That this is Treaſon, and contains a treaſonable matter, Gentlemen, is ſo plain, as no body living can doubt it: But it is a Treaſon of as high a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as peradventure ever was in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and tends as much to that which would be the deſtruction both of the King and Kingdom. The King's life, all our lives, all we have that is dear to us, or of any advantage or avail in the world, are concerned in this. For what does it tend to? It tends to a popular inſurrection, to raiſe the people up in Arms, that like a Deluge would over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>run and ſweep away all. It is to undo the Government and all Order in the Kingdom, and to deſtroy the Life and Being of all that is good amongſt us. Amore virulent and villanous Book certainly was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver written; nor any thing that tended more to Sedition, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the people to a Rebellion: ſuch a Book as peradventure no well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govern'd Kingdom ever heard of the like. It tends to defame the King and all his Anceſtors, and to blaſt all that ſhall come after him, to raiſe us into a Tumult. And what is all this to do? to ſettle the Roman Catholick Religion amongſt us. And this is ſuch a piece of the Art of the Jeſuits, which peradventure hath out-gone all they have done before. It ſeems to be their hand directly, and we are all concerned as Engliſh-men to take care of ſuch Villanies. This is the nature of the Treaſon that is compriſed in this Book. Whether Mr. <hi>Fitzharris</hi> was the Author, or Directer, or Contriver of this Book, is the Queſtion before you. (For plainly (without any ſuppoſe) the Book contains in it as high a Treaſon as ever was.) And as to that, Gentlemen, you muſt conſider that this appears evidently to be a deſigne of the Roman Catholick Partie; 'tis a Jeſuitical deſigne: for this is that they aim at, to confound all things, that they may fiſh in troubled Waters. And you ſee they have found out an apt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſt, one that hath been all-along continually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with them, and intermedled in ſeveral of theſe Plots and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102574:27"/>
Gentlemen, the Evidence that is given here againſt him is by three perſons, and there is great Evidence from the matter that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, beſides thoſe perſons. There is Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> does declare to you the whole of this, and Mr. <hi>Fitzharris</hi>'s application to him to write this Book. He tells you the intention of it, and he gives you the very grounds upon which this was to be written; that is, to raiſe Sedition, that was the firſt inſtruction; to raiſe a Sedition in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and this was to buſie us at home, that the <hi>French</hi> King might get <hi>Flanders</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> while we are confounded at home: and then the Catholicks have their Game to play, and carry all before them. Look you, Gentlemen, Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> is ſo cautious, that he walks not alone in the Caſe, but with a great deal of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence declares it to others, that they may be Witneſſes in the caſe for him. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> does agree in all things for the firſt night that Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> hath declared, how that he heard the directions owned as given by Mr. <hi>Fitzharris</hi> for the writing this Book, and he heard the deſigne of it, he heard there was a Reward promiſed to him for the doing of it, and he tells you ſome of the inſtructions. The next night Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> was preſent; and he tells you all the inſtructions of that night, and that <hi>Fitzharris</hi> owned them, that he gave thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in the private Conſult. But that that is not to be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Gentlemen, is his own inſtructions in writing; what can be ſaid to that? If you were doubtful of the Credit of theſe Gentlemen, yet Mr. <hi>Fitzharris</hi>'s own inſtructions in writing under his hand, are an Evidence beyond all controul in the world that he gave thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections; and theſe are Treaſon, that is plain. And therefore it does ſeem to be as ſtrong an Evidence againſt Mr. <hi>Fitzharris</hi> of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as peradventure ever was given againſt a Traytor. There is not any one Witneſs that ſtands ſingle, but there are two to each night; and his own inſtructions written by himſelf do not ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Evidence of a ſingle Witneſs, for he owned it in the preſence of three Witneſſes: So then a ſtronger Evidence cannot be given that he was the Author and Director of this Book.</p>
               <p>Then, Gentlemen, you muſt conſider what he ſays for himſelf in excuſe of this horrid Treaſon that theſe Witneſſes ſeem ſo fully to fix upon him. The firſt Witneſs he brings is Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and he does tell you, That having ſome diſcourſe with <hi>Everard, Everard</hi> ſhould ſay, this was a deſigne of the Court, and was to be put into ſome Lords, and I think into ſome Parliament-mens pockets; and then they were to be apprehended. I think this is Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Teſtimony. Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> is here upon his Oath, and he teſtifies no ſuch thing in the world: 'Tis eaſie for one to come and ſay, I heard a man ſay ſo; perhaps he ſaid it by way of conjecture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that is no Anſwer to direct proof. Mr. Sheriff <hi>Corniſh</hi> is the next Witneſs, and he ſays, He had ſome diſcourſe with the King, and the King ſhould ſay, He thought Mr. <hi>Fitzharris</hi> had been an honeſt man, and had given him ſome money.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Then it ſeems I was miſtaken; his Majeſtie did not tell
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102574:28"/>
him he took <hi>Fitzharris</hi> to be an honeſt man, but an ill man. But that he had formerly ſome money of the King upon pretence of doing him ſome ſervice, now that brings it out what the Kings meaning was: For it ſeems there had been begg'd ſome money for him, and the King at my Lady <hi>Portſmouth</hi>'s deſire, by way of charitie, gave him ſome little matter of money; he boaſting and telling the King he could do him ſome ſervice. You ſee what manner of ſervice it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e would have done for Him and the Kingdom. Then as to all the reſt of his Evidence, there is Mrs. <hi>Wall</hi> and my Lady Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth;</hi> and he hath examined them concerning the money he hath received, and they both declare upon what ground that money was given: It was given, they tell you, for a Gratuitie from the King to him; and upon his boaſting, ſays Mrs. <hi>Wall,</hi> that he could do the King ſervice, and bring over perſons to his intereſt. I think there is no other Witneſs very material: For as for Mr. <hi>Bulſtrode</hi>'s Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it ſignifies nothing at all; it is not material for him or againſt him in the caſe: A diſcourſe about delivering a Petition to the King from his Wife. Now, Gentlemen, you muſt conſider what ill uſe this Gentleman deſignes to make of the Kings charitie and favour to him; he gave him ſome money to relieve his Wants, and now would he interpret this and inſinuate this to be given for ill purpoſes, for to make him trepan his Subjects; which is another piece of virulencie that theſe Papiſts always exerciſe againſt the King; they always make an ill uſe of his beſt actions, and an ill interpretation of them. For, Gentlemen, can it be believed that the King would ever deſigne ſuch a thing as this is, to blacken his Family for ever, to ſtir up all his Subjects againſt him, to endanger his Crown and Kingdom, and all that he has in the world? And all this to what purpoſe? No co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable deſigne can be made of it. This is ſuch a thing to excuſe ſuch a Villany, as never was heard of, by wreſting the Kings charitie and generoſitie to ſuch ill purpoſes; but that ſome men have the confidence to do any thing. I muſt leave it to you. Here are three witneſs his own hand to theſe inſtructions, and his making a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration that it was not treaſonable enough, nor virulent enough. All theſe things are ſtrong Evidences in the Caſe. And if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve theſe Witneſſes and his own hand-writing, 'tis a plain caſe you muſt find him guilty.</p>

I muſt tell you, Gentlemen, that is not before you at all; the matter of that was by way of abatement pleaded to the juriſdiction of this Court, and that is now over. You muſt have no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor can have any conſideration of that now. Your queſtion is not whether we have authority to trie this Cauſe, but you are impannell'd and ſworn to one point, and that is, whether <hi>Fitz-har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> be guiltie of this Treaſon or not: Whether the Court have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to do it, is another queſtion proper for our determination,

We have all of us a great reverence for the Houſe of Commons, and for their Opinions; but as my Lord hath told you, ſo I tell you my Opinion, That a Vote of the Houſe of Commons does not in the leaſt ſort alter the Law: for indeed if it did, it were to give a Legiſlative power to the Commons, which does onely belong to the King, the Houſe of Lords, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons together. And, Gentlemen, though Mr. <hi>Fitzharris</hi> ſays, If he be acquitted here by you, yet he ſhould remain to be queſtioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in Parliament; there is no man in the world can doubt, if he were acquitted here, and were queſtioned in Parliament, but he would ſay, He hath been upon his legal Tryal by his Peers, and that he hath been acquitted by his Peers upon ſolemn Evidence. But, Gentlemen, you are to conſider what is your buſineſs: Your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is to be Jurors, not to be Judges; you are not to take upon you any ſuch Authority. Your Commiſſion is your Oath, and by that Oath you are ſworn to inquire whether the Priſoner be guilty, as he is indicted, or not: If you, as Engliſh-men, can ſay he is not guilty, let it lie upon your Conſciences, and the danger of the King's Bloud and Life be upon you.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Dolben.</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen, I deſire to ſpeak one word to you, to let you know I am of the ſame Opinion with my Lord, and with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102574:29"/>
my Brother; and I cannot but wonder at you for making this ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for if there were any thing in what you have ſaid, it concerns us that are Judges, and not you at all; for 'tis a matter of Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and whether we have a Juriſdiction or not, we muſt ſatisfie our ſelves that we have a Commiſſion to do it; it concerns not you. Do you but conſider the Oath you have taken, That you will well and truly trie, and true deliverance make betwixt our Soveraign Lord the King, and the Priſoner at the Bar, according to your Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: And you have ſworn a true Verdict to give upon it, and do you now ſcruple whether you ſhould give any Verdict or no, when but even now you have ſworn you will give a Verdict? If any ſuch thing as this had been in your heads, (for it might be then in your heads as well as now) why did not you ſpeak of it before you took your Oath? You now lie under the obligation of an Oath to give a Verdict according to your Evidence, and would you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit him againſt ſuch an Evidence as hath been given? For beſides what Sir <hi>William Waller, Smith,</hi> and <hi>Everard</hi> have depoſed, the very Note ſworn by Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bridgman</hi> to be owned by <hi>Fitzharris</hi> as his hand, contains Treaſon enough in it, if there were no more: Therefore there muſt be ſomething more in it, than for the ſake of ſuch an unreaſonable ſcruple.</p>

               <speaker>Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Juſt. Raymond.</speaker>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I took the liberty to ſpeak it now; I could not ſpeak it before: for I was not then to inquire what I was to be ſworn to, nor could I know what would be the matter that would come before us, till we were ſworn. Therefore I humbly beg your pardon that I made the Motion.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Fitzharris,</hi> we can take no notice of any thing of that nature. When you are aſked what you can ſay why Judgment ſhould not paſs againſt you, it is, What legal matter you have, what matter in Law, to excuſe your ſelf from that Judgment? For this is nothing, the ſaying you are to give Evidence; we know nothing of that, it will not delay Judgment a minute. And for what you ſay it will be prejudicial to the Kings ſervice, it is the King that prays Judgment againſt you by his Attorney.</p>

               <p>Look you, Mr. <hi>Fitzharris,</hi> you have been here indicted for a very great and hainous Treaſon, a Treaſon that is in truth of the firſt magnitude; for it is a Treaſon that tends to the rooting up the whole Government of this Kingdom, and the deſtroying of us all; plainly, both of the King and of all his Subjects. It does not onely deſtroy the Peace and Quiet, but it tends in truth to the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the whole Kingdom, and to bring us into a Confuſion and Diſorder, never to be avoided or retrieved, if your Deſignes ſhould have taken effect. You have been here arraigned, and put your ſelf upon the Countrie, and they have found you gultie of this Treaſon: it is a thing you ſhould well conſider; for certainly, you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to your ſelf a mightie Guilt in ſuch a thing as this is. You have endeavoured the deſtruction of the King, and in ſuch a way as muſt have in truth deſtroyed all his good Subjects together with him. Your deſigne hath been to excite the People to a Rebellion, and a Popular Inſurrection, that would have ſwept away all like a Deluge, if it had taken effect. In truth it is a Treaſon againſt all mankind, the ſtirring up of the People is; it is of evil example to all mankind,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102574:30"/>
the ſtirring up of the People againſt their natural Lord, to whom we owe all Allegiance and Obedience. But your deſigne in this was by ſetting the People of <hi>England</hi> together by the ears, to bring in the Roman Catholick Religion upon ſuch as ſhould be left. It ſeems you are an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſt, and ſucked in very ill principles where you have lived; and you have here endeavoured to do as much miſchief in this Kingdom by that treaſonable Book, as lies in any one mans pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er perhaps to do. It is a mercie and a happineſs, that it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God in his providence to deliver us out of your hands; for this was your deſigne, if you could have brought it about: But it hath pleaſed God now to bring you to Juſtice for it, and the Judgement of the Law muſt paſs upon you. Now that Judgment is this: You muſt return to the <hi>Tower</hi> from whence you came, and from thence you muſt be drawn through the Streets of the City of <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Tyburn;</hi> there you ſhall be hang'd by the Neck, but cut down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are dead; your Bowels ſhall be taken out and burnt before your face, your Head cut off, and your Body divided into four Quarters to be diſpoſed as ſhall pleaſe the King; and I pray God to have mercie upon your Soul, to give you a ſight of your ſin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for it.</p>

            <head>THE TRYAL AND CONDEMNATION OF Dr. Oliver Plunket Titular Primate of IRELAND.</head>
            <p>THE Third of <hi>May</hi> 1681, in <hi>Eaſter,</hi> 33 <hi>Car. Secund. Reg</hi> Dr. <hi>Oliver Plunket</hi> was Arraigned at the King's-Bench-Bar for High-Treaſon, for endeavouring and compaſſing the Kings Death, and to levy War in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and to alter the Religion there, and to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Forreign power: And at his Arraignment, before his Plea, he urged for himſelf, that he was Indicted of the ſame High-Treaſon in <hi>Ireland</hi> and Arraigned, and at the day for his Tryal the Witneſſes againſt him did not appear, and therefore he deſired to know if he could be tried here for the ſame fact? The Court told him, that by a Statute made in this Kingdom, he might be Tryed in the Court of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102574:32"/>
               <hi>Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Bench,</hi> or by Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> in any part of <hi>England</hi> for Facts ariſing in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that this Arraignment there (he being never tried upon it) was not ſufficient to exempt him from being tried here; becauſe till a Tryal be paſſed, and there be a Conviction or Acquittal thereupon, an Arraignment, barely, is no Plea: For in ſuch Caſes the party is not put Twice in danger of his Life, which only is the thing the Law in ſuch Caſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es, which they told him he could not do till after Plea pleaded; whereupon he pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> and put himſelf upon the Country for his Tryal; and after ſome conſideration had about time to be allowed him to bring his Witneſſes from <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Court appointed the day for his Tryal, to be the firſt <hi>Wedneſday</hi> in next Term, which was full Five Weeks time.</p>
            <p>And accordingly on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> in <hi>Trinity</hi> Term, he was brought to his Tryal, and Proclamation, as in ſuch Caſes is uſual, being made, it proceeded thus.</p>

So I humbly beg your Lordſhips favour, the Caſe is rare, and ſcarce happens in Five hundred years, that one ſhould be in my circumſtances.

And when the Orders went over, that I ſhould be tryed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that no <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> ſhould be upon the Jury, and ſo it was in both the Grand and other Jury; yet then when I came to my Tryal, after I was Arraigned, not one appeared: This is manifeſt upon the Record and can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>

And the Indictment further ſets forth, that to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh theſe Treaſons, the Defendent did raiſe great Sums of Money in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and did get ſeveral perſons to contribute ſeveral Sums for theſe Treaſons; and that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent with others did disburſe ſeveral Sums of Money to ſeveral perſons, to perſwade them and entice them to be aiding and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in theſe Treaſons, and to recompence them for them.

But in ſhort, You have heard his Charge is as high as can be againſt the King, and againſt the Nation, and againſt all that is good. The Deſign and endeavour of this Gentleman was the Death of the King, and the Deſtruction of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the raiſing of War: And to accompliſh this, we charge him, that there was a Confederacy made, Aſſemblies and Conſultations had to theſe ends, and raiſing Money to accompliſh it. Gentlemen, Dr. <hi>Plunket</hi> was made as we ſhall prove to you, as they there call him, Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and he got that Dignity from the Pope upon this very Deſign. He did by Vertue of that Power, which he thought he had gotten, make out Warants, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications, I know not what they call them, to know how many men in <hi>Ireland</hi> could bear Arms from Sixteen to Fourty; he raiſes Taxes upon the People and the Clergy there. But, My Lord, the particulars will beſt fall from the Witneſſes that we ſhall call and prove it by, and we need not make any aggravation; for ſuch a thing as this cannot be more aggravated than 'tis.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Jury, the Character this Gentleman bears, as Primate under a Forreign and Uſurped Juriſdiction, will be a great Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to you to give credit to that Evidence we ſhall produce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you. We ſhall prove, that this very Preferment was confer'd upon him upon a Contract, that he ſhould raiſe Sixty Thouſand Men in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the Pope's Service, to ſettle Popery there, and to ſubvert the Government. The Evidence that we ſhall give you, will prove how it leads to deſtroy the King, and I take it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the reſolutions that have been, to raiſe War in the Kingdom, and to introduce a Forreign Power, will be certainly Evidence of an Attempt and Machination to deſtroy the King. Aſſoon as he was in poſſeſſion of his Primacy, he goes about his work. There are two great neceſſaries to be provided, Men and Money. For men, having this great Spiritual Juriſdiction, whereby, indeed, all that are under it are become Slaves, he iſſues out his Warrants to all the Clergy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to give an Account, and make Return from the ſeveral Pariſhes, of all the men in them above Fourteen and under Sixty. And Returns were accordingly made by them, that he might accordingly take a meaſure what men to pick out for the Service. The next thing was Money, My Lord; and your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip takes notice, that when the Mind is enſlaved, the Purſe, nay all the Body bows to it. He iſſues out his Warrants to his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, to make a Collection of Money, in all parts great Sums were Levied, and when they were Levied, we ſhall give you an accompt by our Proofs, that ſeveral Sums were iſſued out, and ſent into <hi>France</hi> to further the Buſineſs. There was alſo proviſion made of great Ammunition and Arms, and we ſhall prove in particular, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral delivered out by this Gentleman's Order, to carry on this thing; and to go through ſtitch with this buſineſs, he takes a view of all the ſeveral Ports and places in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where it would be convenient to land: For they were to have from <hi>France</hi> an Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary Forcce, and upon his view he pitched upon <hi>Carlingford</hi> as the place. We ſhall prove the ſeveral Correſpondencies between <hi>Rome</hi> and him, and <hi>France</hi> and him, and ſeveral Meſſengers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and Moneys iſſued out from time to time for their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. This will be the courſe of our Evidence; and we ſhall begin firſt with ſome that do not ſpeak ſo particularly to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, but prove there was a general Deſign in all parts of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to bring in the King of <hi>France,</hi> and extirpate the Proteſtant Rehgion: And then we ſhall call the particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the particular Facts againſt him.

               <p>Yes, I know there was a Plot, both before <hi>Plunket</hi>'s time, and in his time; for it was working in the years 65, and 66. but it was brought to full maturitie in the year 1667. For then Col. <hi>Miles Rely,</hi> and Col. <hi>Bourne</hi> was ſent to <hi>Ireland</hi> from the King of <hi>France,</hi> with a Commiſſion to muſter as many men as he could, promiſing to ſend an Army of 40000 men with a Commiſſion, upon St. <hi>Lewis</hi> day in <hi>Auguſt</hi> next following, to land at <hi>Carlingford</hi> to deſtroy all the true Subjects, to deſtroy the Religion as it was eſtabliſhed there, and to ſet up the <hi>French</hi> King's authority and the Roman-Catholick Religion. And one <hi>Edmond Angle</hi> that was a Juſtice of peace and Clerk of the Crown, ſent for all the Rebels abroad in the North to come up into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Longford,</hi> and they marched into the head-Town of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fired the Town; the Inhabitants fled into the Caſtle: then they came up to the Goal, thinking to break it open, and by ſetting the Priſoners free, to joyn them with them; but then <hi>Angle</hi> was ſhot, received a deadly wound, and dropt off his Horſe, and they fled. So then when they were without the Town, one <hi>Charles Mac Canell</hi> alighted, and took away all the Papers out of his Pocket; which if they had been found, would have diſcovered all. This occaſioned Col. <hi>Bourne</hi> to be ſuſpected; and being ſo ſuſpected, he was taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and turned to <hi>Newgate</hi> in <hi>Dublin.</hi> Then Col. <hi>Riley</hi> fled away again to <hi>France,</hi> and the Plot lay under a Cloud during th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He ſays, my Lord, that ten years ago I had ſuch a deſign in hand, and he knew the money was collected for theſe very ends, and he knew of the deſign from that ſame Capt. <hi>O Neal</hi> whom I employed and ſent abroad; and that I had a deſign to bring in the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Carling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and went about to all the Ports in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and pitched upon that as the moſt convenient; and yet it is ſo inconvenient for the bringing in a forein Force, that any one that knows any thing of the Maps of the world, will eaſily conclude it otherwiſe. But, I ſay, my Lord, why did not he tell ſome Juſtice of the peace that I was upon ſuch a deſign, but let me live in <hi>Ireland</hi> ten years after, and never ſpeak of it till now?</p>

               <p>When he ſaw me all the time, and to the time of my taking Priſoner, and never ſaid one word; for I was a Priſoner ſix months onely for my Religion, not one word of Treaſon ſpoken of againſt me for ſo many years: why did not he acquaint ſome Juſtice of the peace with it before?</p>

I had been half a year at the Spaniſh Embaſſadours, and he ſent me for <hi>Ireland</hi> again, and then I lived at the Convent in <hi>Dublin;</hi> and then when I knew that he would come to Town, I went to <hi>Rings-end,</hi> where the Ships came in, to meet him.</p>

               <p>I went into <hi>France</hi> in (77) and I was not there a year altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but when I have ſeen how the poor people there are brought into ſuch ſlaverie by the French King, I thought of it, and had rather the Devil ſhould reign over us, than the French-man.</p>

Upon that, ſaies Sir <hi>Nicholas Plunket,</hi> What is that? Why it was ſaid it was to raiſe 60000 men in <hi>Ireland</hi> at any time whenever the French or the Spaniſh King ſhould wage War with <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Ireland.</hi> And this man did confeſs before my face to Father <hi>Duffy,</hi> that it was not onely to exalt himſelf, but all the Roman Clergie, and all the Gentrie that had loſt their Eſtates.</p>

               <p>Look you Mr. <hi>Plunket,</hi> conſider with your ſelf 50 or 500 in this Caſe is not 5 farthings difference, but the money was to be raiſed by your Order.</p>

               <p>Ay, but whether it was not raiſed to this Effect, There is never a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where the Roman Catholick Religion is profeſſed, but hath an Agent for their Spiritual Affairs at <hi>Rome,</hi> and this was for the Spiritual Affairs of the Clergy of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

               <p>I will tell you how it fell out afterwards. Then I came along into <hi>Marſeilles</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and there were 2 Captains that had as much notice as I had in that Letter, for they were diſcourſing that they would advance themſelves in the <hi>French</hi> Kings ſervice, and hoped, that by the King of <hi>France</hi>'s help to have the Roman Catholick faith ſet up in their own Country; why, that diſcourſe paſſed off for I was mightily affraid of any ſuch thing, becauſe I was of another opinion; for perhaps I might think the Roman Catholick faith would flouriſh as well as ever it did, and hoped ſo as well as any body elſe, but not by the Sword. As I came to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> there came one <hi>Hugh O Donnell</hi> Son to <hi>O Donnell</hi> with Letters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, and thoſe Letters were to intitle the young man Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and likewiſe that his Majeſty, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhould help him for <hi>Ireland,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the form of the Letters he had. And then as I came for <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſpeedily after there came Letters of Recommendation to me, that I ſhould preſent my ſelf to my Lord Primate, to hear Confeſſions and be heard Preach. I came to his Lordſhip at his own Houſe the 9<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> (74) and there he kept me ſeveral hours, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved me; and the Copy of the Approbation I have to ſhew. Andafter a long diſpute we went aſide, and went to to look Father <hi>Patrick,</hi> and there he ſhewed me ſuch and ſuch things. And after a long diſcourſe I told my Lord Primate, I ſee your Lordſhips Letter, which you ſent by young <hi>O Neale,</hi> in ſuch a place, and he ſhew'd me the Contents of it and ſaid, ay, my Lord, 'tis a good Intention and Deſign, if it can be done without bloodſhed, then my Lord muſed a little, and ſaid he, well Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Francis</hi> (which is my name in Religion, my Chriſtian Name was <hi>John)</hi> pray will you keep it ſecret, well my Lord ſaid I, you need not fear; for ſaid he, what ever I have done herein was not for my own good, but for the publick good of the Catholicks. Well ſaid I, 'tis well. Then does he commend me into the Pariſh of where this Mr. <hi>Murfey</hi> here was to put in a Bull, that I had from my Lord Primate, which Bull was brought here laſt year; and there he profered me high Promotions, if I would further ſuch things, and ſolicite ſuch Gentlemen as I knew would be private in ſuch a buſineſs, ſuch as were old Commanders among my Friends and Relations. Shortly after this I ſaw <hi>Plunket</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Tyrrel</hi> and Captain <hi>Con O Neale,</hi> practiſing to bring Soldiers ready for <hi>Ireland,</hi> aſſoon as they could get opportunity. This Captain <hi>Con O Neale</hi> coming to the place where we kept our Priory, and he and his Brothers were Sons to General <hi>O Neale.</hi> And there Captain <hi>Con</hi> comes in the Night time and lodges with us, and diſcourſed with his Brother and I, becauſe I was his Companion beyond Sea, about theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, That he expected my Lord Primate and Biſhop <hi>Tyrrels</hi> coming thither that Night, to make ſome propoſals about the Church and other Affairs. After 10 a Clock or thereabouts, my Lord Primate and Biſhop <hi>Tyrrel</hi> came with others in their Company, and there they and Father <hi>O Neale</hi> did conſult amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they ſhould ſend Captain <hi>Con</hi> to <hi>France</hi> and to <hi>Barcellona</hi> with ſuch and ſuch Inſtruments; and ſending thoſe Inſtruments away, Captain <hi>Con</hi> departs the Countrey and goes for <hi>France</hi> ſoon after; and ſpeedily my Lord Primate under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, that he and Biſhop <hi>Tyrrel</hi> ſhould view <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſee how affairs ſtood. Soon after my Lord Primate calls a General Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Council, and ſends out his Orders to levy ſuch and ſuch Taxes and Subſidies, and Warrants to all the Pariſh Prieſts, that they ſhould give them new Liſts to know whether the Numbers they had ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> before, would comply with that Liſt. And then <hi>O Neale</hi> went to view the Forts of <hi>Charlemont</hi> and <hi>Dun-Gannon,</hi> whileſt thoſe Lords did collect the money; the Orders I have ſeen with my own proper Eyes, and his own man confeſſed before the Council in <hi>Ireland</hi> that my Lord gave them under his hand.</p>

               <p>Only this my Lord, your Lordſhips ſees how I am dealth with. Firſt and foremoſt, I have not time to bring my Witneſſes, or my Records, which if I had, I would not weigh one Farthing to leave my Cauſe with any Jury in the World. Beſides all this, I am brought out of my own native Countrey, where theſe men lived, and I lived, and where my Witneſſes and Records are, which would ſhew what theſe People are. I ſent by the Poſt and did all that I could, and what can I ſay when I have not my Witneſſes againſt theſe People, they may ſwear any thing in the World; you cannot but obſerve the Improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the thing in it ſelf, and unto what a Condition I am brought. My Lord, my Life is in imminent Danger, becauſe I am brought out of my own Country, where theſe People would not be believed againſt me.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I think this matter lies in a narrow Compaſs, the Evidence hath been long; I would only repeat the ſhort heads of that which hath been given at large. He is Indicted for a Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to kill the King, the Overt Act is an Endeavour to introduce a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to raiſe an Army, and levy War there; and the Proof of it hath been very full. The Proof in general, that there was a Plot to introduce the <hi>French,</hi> is plain by all the Witneſſes, and the Proof in particular upon this Perſon at the Barr, hath been as plain as any thing can be. They prove to your Lordſhip in general, that there was an Expectation that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould come in, that there was an Invitation of <hi>Florence Wyer</hi> the firſt Witneſs, to go over into <hi>France,</hi> and ſpeedily he ſhould have a Command upon his return, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that there were Preparations; for this appears by the Oath of Secrecy given to ſeveral men. Forty men that came along with Biſhop <hi>Tyrrel</hi> to keep it private during their Lives; and there was a farther Proof of that general Conſpiracy by <hi>Duffy,</hi> that when there was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Meeting of ſo many thouſand People for Confirmation, there was by the Gentlemen at that Meeting a ſecret Conſultation how to carry on the Deſign, and how to liſt Men, and to look out the old Officers in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> late Rebellion, and to ſee what Poſture they were in, as to the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102574:48"/>
of this Deſign, and this comes now particularly to the Priſoner who was by at this Conſultation, ſo the Witneſſes do tell you. But that that comes nearer to him, is, that he did iſſue out Orders for the raiſing of Money, and that he did raiſe Money purſuant to thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and did receive Money for that very purpoſe; this is proved by three Witneſſes, <hi>Duffy,</hi> and <hi>Mac Legh</hi> who paid the Money, and by <hi>Moyer</hi> the laſt Witneſs, who ſaw him receive it from ſeveral Perſons. This is poſitive upon him; nay, they ſay farther, that there was a Liſt made of the ſeveral men, in the ſeveral Pariſhes, that were able to bear Arms upon occaſion, from ſixteen to ſixty, and there was a Liſt of a matter of threeſcore thouſand men that were ready upon any Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to riſe for the Purpoſe, and this Liſt was delivered over into the Hands of the Priſoner at the Barr. There is one Witneſs, <hi>Duffy,</hi> that ſaies farther, that he ſaw a Letter under his Hand in <hi>France</hi> to the Cardinal <hi>Bouillon,</hi> to invite the French King into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and he did wonder that he ſhould ſpend his Time and Blood in Wars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Spain,</hi> which was a Roman Catholick, and not come into <hi>Ireland</hi> to extirpate the Hereticks. And this Letter is confirmed by another Letter, which was ſeen by <hi>Moyer,</hi> a Copy of which is produced, which he tranſlated from the Original in Latin, and the Letter was ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Neale O Neale,</hi> whom the Priſoner ſaies he had no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for, but to give him ſome Recommendations.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plunkett.</speaker>
               <p>I gave him no Recommendations.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>No, he ſaies he did not give him any, nor ſent any Letter by him.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Then he urged, that he went along begging by the Way, but 'tis proved he was ſent by him, and ſent with Letters, and that by his Brother in Law, who met him at <hi>Mants.</hi> And 'tis proved by <hi>Moyer,</hi> who ſaw the Letter opened, taking it to be but a common Letter of Recommendation, he read the Letter and took a Copy of it, and tranſlated that Copy, which Tranſlation is enough to verify all the matter which the Witneſſes have ſworn, for 'tis agreeing to what he ſaid to Cardinal <hi>Bouillon</hi> in his other Letter, that it was more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Catholick Princes to agree together to extirpate Hereſy, than to vary amongſt themſelves, that now was the time: for there were threeſcore thouſand Men ready to riſe upon ſuch an Invaſion. This is the Subſtance of the Letter, and this proves fully the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy this man was ingaged in, his receiving Money, his Liſting Men, and his Invitation of forreign Princes. And this is fully proved.</p>

This is the Subſtance of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and this is Proof enough, we think, to convict any Man of this Fact.</p>

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Serj. Jefferies.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I ſhall trouble you but with one word that hath been omitted. I think 'tis a Cauſe of great Example, and that thing which the Priſoner ſeems to make his Excuſe hath been anſwered by a Favor and Indulgence from the Court in a very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102574:48"/>
manner. For, in as much as this Gentleman would make it a very hard Caſe, That he is brought out of his own Country, and hath not his Witneſſes; it is very well known that by a particular Favor of the Court, which is not uſual in theſe Caſes, he had between five and ſix weeks time for preparation for his Tryal: ſo that truly as to what does appear, I think all the Witneſſes that have been examined, are Witneſſes to be credited, except you Gentlemen, of your ſelves can convict upon your own Knowledge theſe Perſons of any Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor, which I think you cannot, much leſs of Perjury. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Witneſſes we have produced, all which ſpeak to the Plot in general, and four of them fix it upon the Perſon at the Bar; they ſpeak particularly, and every one agrees in Circumſtances, and that other that ſpoke mincingly, I put it upon; it is the greateſt Evidence that can be. For that Perſon that could come before a Grand-Jury, and there be the main Witneſs, but when he comes here, muſt be ſcru'd and pump'd to diſcover the ſeventy thouſand men. And I ſuppoſe you did obſerve how difficult it was to kno' of him, whether this Perſon was Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or whether it were from the Authority of the King or the Pope, a very probable thing, that he ſhould be ſuch a one as the King deſigned to be Primate and Superintendent of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Lord, this I deſire to take notice of too, that <hi>Wyer,</hi> the firſt Witneſs, fixes four particular things upon the Priſoner at the Bar, which have not yet been taken notice of. Firſt, he fixes a Diſcourſe with another Perſon that was Competitor with him for this very Office, Biſhop <hi>Duffy,</hi> and he gives the Reaſon why he was admitted into the Office rather than the other, becauſe he was a man of greater A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to carry on the Deſign, and tho' he does not give you an account of the Deſign; yet the reſt of the Evidence do, and make it to be the Deſign then carrying on. Another thing is, he tells you of the ſending one into <hi>France,</hi> that was to come back again in order to this Deſign, I think his name was <hi>Mac Donnel,</hi> and then the great Tory <hi>Flemming</hi> and he were to come back again Collonels in the Army that was to be raiſed. The next Perſon, that fixes it upon him, is Mr. <hi>Han O Neal,</hi> and he gives the plaineſt Circumſtances, That at a time in <hi>Auguſt</hi> when Biſhop <hi>Tyrrell</hi> came to the Houſe of one <hi>Bradey</hi> with ſo many men well equipped with ſuch and ſuch Arms, and took the Oath of Secrecy; he himſelf, but not only he, but the other Prieſt <hi>Mac Legh,</hi> was preſent at the ſame time, and took the ſaid Oath, and he does tell you that that very Prieſt was ſent to <hi>Dublin</hi> to diſcover it at that very time, and ſo he hath fixed the Perſon, and Time, and the Buſineſs they came about. Then <hi>Mac Legh</hi> comes and tells you the ſame thing in every Circumſtance; ay, but ſays the Priſoner at the Bar, and he would make it to be a great Objection, How chance that they have concealed this all the while, and not diſcovered it to ſome Juſtice of the Peace? Why, ſays one, I was under your Juriſdiction in that place, that is the very Reaſon he gives wherefore he durſt not, and ſays another, I was concerned and as earneſt as the Priſoner or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body elſe, but going into <hi>France,</hi> I obſerved the ſlavery that all the Subjects were under, under the Tyranny of that King, and apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ſame King was to come into <hi>Ireland</hi> by the means of theſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102574:49"/>
Gentlemen; I was concerned at it, and had rather the Devil ſhould reign over us than ſuch an one, and therefore I will diſcover it. And he ſaid very well I think, that he had rather have the Devil to reign; for it ſeems to be him, or one in his ſhape that reigns after that manner. And there are two Perſons that ſwear to the vey year that they were obliged to raiſe the money, and ſwear poſitively, they ſaw his Orders <hi>Sub poena ſuſpenſio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is,</hi> I do not know whether they mean hang'd or ſuſpended from their Office. But it ſeems it was ſo terrible, that it made them pay twenty Shillings a piece for three years ſucceſſively. And there is another Gentleman that tells you, that out of a ſmall Living, wherein he was concerned only as Curate to a third Perſon it had been paid two or three times, and another tho' he was exempt himſelf from the payment, yet ſo great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident was he of the Priſoner's at the Bar, that he was preſent when he ſaw thirty or fourty pay this Tax, and whereas the Priſoner at the Bar would make it thought a ſtrange thing, that he ſhould raiſe ſo much money, who had but an houſe ſeven foot high, it ſeems there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that thatched houſe a Chappel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plunkett.</speaker>
               <p>There is no Chappel.</p>

               <p>But now my Lord, that which ſubſtantially proves what theſe Witneſſes ſay, is the Letter that is ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> to the Secratary of the College <hi>de propaganda Fide,</hi> which is the laſt Letter that the laſt Gentleman ſpeaks of, wherein he does particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly take notice, that he had taken care to raiſe ſuch moneys, and view all the Ports and Places of Strength. And my Lord, that which is a very great Circumſtance to back the Evidence of the firſt Letter to the French Cardinal <hi>Bouillon</hi> which was taken notice of by the firſt Witneſs, and there is ſuch a paſſage in this too, that the Catholick Princes ſhould not ſpill one anothers blood, when they might better employ it here in <hi>Ireland</hi> for the Propagation of the Faith; this laſt Letter takes particular notice of that very inſtance too, that inſtead of drawing their Swords againſt one another, they had better come to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Catholick Faith in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Theſe four Witneſſes are pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and preciſe in every particular Circumſtance of the Caſe, and againſt them there is nothing but the common Objection. If I had ſuch Records, and Witneſſes here I could make my Defence, that is, if he had thoſe things that he has not, he might appear to be another man than he is; but I am ſure, as it appears upon the Evidence that hath been given by all the Witneſſes, there is a plain Proof and a full Proof of every Treaſon laid to his Charge.</p>

               <p>Look you Gentlemen of the Jury, This Gentleman here Mr. <hi>Plunket,</hi> is indicted of High-Treaſon, and 'tis for Conſpiring the King's Death, and endeavouring to bring the French Army into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for to invade that Kingdom, and to plant the Romiſh Religion in that Kingdom. You have had Evidence againſt him that hath been fully examined. And theſe things do ſeem to be very plain by the Witneſſes, That he himſelf hath taken a Commiſſion, or a Grant, or what you will pleaſe to call it, from the Pope to be Primate of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that he hath taken upon him to make Laws as the Provincial, and that he hath undertaken and endeavoured to ſettle the Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in that Kingdom, and in order to that, he hath invited the Aid of the French Army, and that he hath for the better landing of them, looked out what places were moſt convenient for them; That he haſh ſet a Tax upon the Clergy within his Province for the facilitating of all this, and for the making preparations for the entertainment of this Army. This the Wittneſſes teſtifie againſt him, and that there were ſome Towns, as <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ngannon</hi> and another Town, that were to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed to the Frenh. Now you muſt conſider concerning theſe Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: If you believe the Evidence that hath been given, and which hath been repeated by the Kings Counſel, and if you believe that he did deſign to bring in a French Army, to eſtabliſh the Roman Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there again, and that he took upon him to raiſe money for that purpoſe, ſurvey'd the Ports, and made ſuch proviſions, as the Witneſſes
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102574:50"/>
ſpeak of, and was in that Conſpiracy; you muſt find him Guilty, I leave it to you, it is a pretty ſtrong Evidence, he does not ſay any thing to it, but that his Witneſſes are not come over.</p>

               <p>I can ſay nothing to it, but give my own Proteſtation, that there is not one word of this ſaid againſt me is true, but all plain Romance, I never had any Communication with any French Miniſter, Cardinal, nor other.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then the Jury withdrew for a Quarter of an Hour, and being return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gave this Verdict.</p>

               <p>My Lord, may it pleaſe your Lordſhip, I have ſomething to ſay, which if your Lordſhip will conſider ſeriouſly, may occaſion the Courts Commiſeration and Mercy. I have my Lord for this Fact been Arraigned in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and brought to my Trial there. At the Day of my Tryal all the Witneſſes voluntarily abſented themſelves, ſeeing I had Records and Witneſſes to convince them evidently and ſhew what men they were, and the prepenſed Malice that they did bear to me, and ſo finding that I could clear my ſelf evidently, they abſented themſelves, on the day of my Tryal no Chriſtian appeared, but hither over they come, and procure that I ſhould be brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where I could not have a Jury that knew the Qualities of my Adverſaries, or who knew me, or the Circumſtances of the Places, Times, and Perſons; the Juries here as I ſay were altogether Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to theſe Affairs, and ſo my Lord they could not know many things that conduce to a fair Tryal, and it was morally impoſſible they ſhould know it. I have been accuſed principally and chiefly for ſurveying the Ports, for fixing upon <hi>Carlingford</hi> for the Landing of the <hi>French,</hi> for the having of ſeventy Thouſand Men ready to joyn with the <hi>French,</hi> for collecting Money for the Agents in this matter, for the aſſiſting of the French and this great Utopian Army.

And whereas I had Influence only upon one Province, as is well known, tho' I had the Title of Primate of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> as the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath of all <hi>England;</hi> yet the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> will not permit him to meddle with his Province; and 'tis well known by the Gentry there, and thoſe that are accuſtomed to the place; That in all the Province of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> take Men, Women, and Children of the Roman Catholicks, they could not make up ſeventy Thouſand. This, a Jury there my Lord had known very well, and therefore the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> which are very favourable to the Priſoner, have provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that there ſhould be a Jury of the Place where the Fact was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as Sr. <hi>Thomas Gaſcoine,</hi> as I have heard, had a <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Jury, tho' he was tryed at <hi>London.</hi> And then after my coming here, I was kept cloſe Priſoner for ſix Months, not any Chriſtian was permitted to come at me, nor did I know any thing, how things ſtood in the World. I was brought here the third of <hi>May,</hi> to be Arraigned, and I did petition your Lordſhip to have ſome time for my Tryal, and I would have had it put off till <hi>Michaelmaſs,</hi> but your Lordſhips did not think fit to grant ſo long, but only till the eighth of this Month, when my Witneſſes who were ready at the Sea ſide, would not come over without Paſſes, and I could not get over the Records without an Order from hence; which Records would have ſhewn that ſome of the Witneſſes were Indicted and found Guilty of high Crimes, ſome wer e impriſoned for Robberies, and ſome of the Witneſſes were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous People, ſo I petitioned the eighth of this Month, that I might have time but for twelve days more, but your Lordſhip thought, when the Motion was made, that it was only to put off my Tryal, and now my Witneſſes are come to <hi>Coventry</hi> yeſterday morning, and they will be here in a few days, and ſo for want of time to deſend my ſelf in, I was expoſed to my Adverſaries, who were ſome of my own Clergy, whom for their debauched Lives, I have corrected, as is well known there. I will not deny my ſelf, but that as long as there was any Toleration and Connivance, I did Execute the Function of a Biſhop, and that by the ſecond of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is only a Premunire, and no Treaſon. So that my Lord, I was expoſed Defenceleſs to my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whereas now my Witneſſes are come, that could make all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. I did begg for twelve days time, whereby you might have ſeen as plain as the Sun, what thoſe Witneſſes are, that began the Story, and ſay theſe things againſt me.

If they had accuſed me of a <hi>Praemunire</hi> for the exerciſe of my Epiſcopal Function, perhaps they had ſaid ſome thing that might have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, but my Lord, as I am a dying Man, and hope for Salvation by my Lord and Savior, I am not guilty of one point of Treaſon they have ſwore againſt me, no more than the Child that was born, but yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. I have an Atteſtation under my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s hand concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my good Behavior in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not only from him, but from my Lord <hi>Berkly,</hi> who was alſo Governor there, which the Kings At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney ſaw; But here I was brought, here I was tryed, and having not time to bring my Witneſſes, I could not prove my Innocency, as otherwiſe I might. So that, if there be any Caſe in the world that deſerves Compaſſion, ſurely my Caſe does; and 'tis ſuch a rare Caſe, as I believe you will not find two of them in Print, that one Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhould be tryed here afterwards for the ſame Fact. My Lord, if there be any thing in the world that deſerves pity, this does, for I can ſay, as I hope for Mercy, I was never Guilty of any one point they have ſwore againſt me, and if my Petition for time had been granted, I could have ſhewn how all was prepenſe Malice againſt me, and have produced all Circumſtances that could make out the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of a Perſon. But not having had time, and being Tryed, I am at your Mercy.</p>

               <p>Look you Mr. <hi>Plunket,</hi> You have been here indicted of a very great and hainous Crime, the greateſt and moſt hainous of all Crimes, and that is, High-Treaſon; and truly yours is a Treaſon of the higheſt Nature, 'tis a Treaſon in truth againſt God and your King, and the Countrey where you lived. You have done as much as you could to diſhonor God in this Caſe; for the bottom of your Treaſon was, your ſetting up your falſe Religion, than which, there is not any thing more diſpleaſing to God, or more pernicious to Mankind in the world. A Religion that is ten times worſe than all the heatheniſh Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, the moſt diſhonorable and derogatory to God and his Glory of all Religions or pretended Religions whatſoever, for it undertakes to diſpenſe with Gods Laws, and to pardon the breach of them. So that certainly a greater Crime there cannot be committed againſt God, than for a man to endeavour the Propagation of that Religion; but you, to effect this, have deſigned the Death of your lawful Prince and King. And then your deſign of Blood in the Kingdom where you lived, to ſet all together by the Ears, to deſtroy poor Innocent People, to proſtitute their Lives and Liberties, and all that is dear to them, to the Tyranny
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102574:51"/>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> and that by introducing a French Army. What greater Evil can be deſigned by any man, I mention theſe things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have all been fully proved againſt you; and that you may take notice, and repent of them, and make your Peace with God, by a particular Application for Mercy for all theſe Faults; For it ſeems to me, that againſt God, your Prince, and fellow Subjects, you have behaved your ſelf very ill, deſigning very great Evil to all theſe; and now it hath pleaſed God to bring you to Judgment.</p>
               <p>I muſt tell you, peradventure what you urge for your ſelf might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Pity, if it were to be believed, that is, that you are Innocent, and had Witneſſes to prove it, but we cannot ſuppoſe any man Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that hath had a Legal and a Fair Tryal, and a Tryal with as much Candor to you, as your Caſe could bear, or as perhaps any man in ſuch a Caſe ever had. You had time upon your Requeſt to ſend for your Witneſſes, to help you in your Defence, and to have proved your Innocence, if you could have done it; Time long enough to your own Content, you your ſelf thought it ſo, at the time it was given. To give a Priſoner under your Circumſtances, five or ſix weeks time to ſend for Witneſſes, is not uſual, we could have put you upon a preſent Defence, and hurryed you out of the World by a ſuddain Tryal, if we had had any Deſign againſt you; but we go on in a fair way, and with legal Proceedings, and with as much Reſpect to you, as in ſuch a Caſe could be uſed, for we gave you all the fair Hearing and Liberty that you deſired to have.</p>
               <p>Look you, as to what you urge, that your Trial was in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whereas your Offence was in another, that is a thing that do's not become you by any means to object; for you have had a Tryal here by honeſt Perſons, and that according to the Laws which obtain in this Kingdom, and that too of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is by a Statute not made on purpoſe to bring you into a Snare, but an antient Statute, and not without Preſidents of its having been put in Execution before your time. For your own Country will afford you ſeveral Preſidents in this Caſe, as <hi>O Rurke,</hi> and ſeveral others that have been Arrained and Condemned for Treaſon done there. So that you have no reaſon to except againſt the legality of your Tryal. You ſay, now you have Witneſſes that could prove all this Matter, why that lyes in the Mouth of any Man that is condemned to ſay; but pray conſider with your ſelf, what Regard ought to be given to this. We cannot help it, if your Witneſſes don't come, you may remember they wanted not Time nor Opportunity to come over, but you told us they would not come unleſs they had a Paſſeport.</p>

               <p>How could any one ſoreſee, unleſs he was God Almighty, that they would deny it, or that he could not get out a Copy of a Record, paying for it, without a Petition. All the Friends I had, told me upon Motion there, it might be had, but here I have it under the Lieutenants and Councils hands, that they would give no Copy of Records without Order from hence, which before I could know it, it was impoſſible for me to have them ready againſt my Tryal.</p>

I appeal to all that heard your Tryal, if they could ſo much as doubt but that you were Guilty of what you were charged with. For conſider, here were Perſons that were of your own Religion, the moſt of them Prieſts, I think almoſt all of them in Orders.</p>

Let me but put you in mind of one thing. You made Exceptions to one's Evidence, (and indeed that was very much of your Exception to all) why he did not reveal this in all that time: Truly he told you he was of your mind, till he went into <hi>France,</hi> and ſaw what a Slavery and Miſchief you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to introduce upon his and your own Countrymen, and this his Spirit roſe againſt, to ſee what a Condition <hi>Ireland</hi> was like to be brought into. And pray, did not he give you a full Anſwer to that Queſtion?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plunkett.</speaker>
               <p>I had ſufficient Witneſſes to prove he was an Apoſtate, and was chaſtiſed by me, and therefore had prepenſed Malice againſt me.</p>

               <p>Therefore I have ſpoken this to the Satisfaction, I hope, of your ſelf and all that hear it. I do now wiſh you to conſider, you are near your end. It ſeems you have lived in a falſe Religion hitherto; it is not too late at any time to repent, I wiſh you may have the Grace to do ſo; In the mean time there is no room for us here, to grant you any king of Mercy, tho' I'le tell you, we are inclined to pity all Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors: Who ever have done evil, we are inclined to pity them, and wiſh heartily that they may repent, as we do, that you may, of what you have done. But all we can do now, is to ſay, what the Law ſaies, and that is to paſs Judgment upon you.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip to give me Leave to ſpeak one Word. If I were a Man that had no care of my Conſcience in this matter, and did not think of God Almighty, or Conſcience, or Heaven, or Hell, I might have ſaved my Life; For I was offered it by divers People here, ſo I would but Confeſs my own Guilt, and Accuſe others. But my Lord, I had rather dye ten thouſand deaths, than wrongfully accuſe any body. And the time will come when your Lordſhip will ſee what theſe Witneſſes are, that have come in againſt me. I do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your Lordſhip, if I were a man that had not good Principles, I

might eaſily have ſaved my own Life, but I had rather dye ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Deaths, than wrongfully to take away one farthing of any man's Goods, one day of his Liberty, or one minute of his Life.</p>

               <p>Well, however the Judgment which we give you, is that which the Law ſaies and ſpeaks. And therefore you muſt goe from hence, to the place from whence you came, that is to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and from thence you ſhall be drawn through the City of <hi>London,</hi> to <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne;</hi> there you ſhall be hanged by the Neck, but cut down before you are dead, your Bowels ſhall be taken out, and burnt before your Face, your Head ſhall be cut off, and your Body be divided into four Quarters, to be diſpoſed of as his Majeſty pleaſes. And I pray God to have Mercy upon your Soul.</p>
