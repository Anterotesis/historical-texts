            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Right Honourable, Worthy and Dearly beloved <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Country-men,</hi> hear the Word of God, as you will find it written in the</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>II Epist. of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> chap. 1. vers. 7.</bibl> 
               <p>And to Godliness <hi>[add]</hi> Brotherly Kindness; and to Brotherly Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Charity.</p>
            </q>
            <p>THe Words, I have now read unto you, as they are very necessary and suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the general purposes of <hi>Christianity,</hi> so are they no less seasonable and fit for the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61396:4"/>
particular occasion and business of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Meeting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Here is <hi>Godliness</hi> in a more especial manner to be practised by us at the <hi>Church,</hi> where we are now met, in our attendance upon the service of God and hearing his Word. Then, <hi>Brotherly Kindness</hi> to be shewn, when we meet at the <hi>Table</hi> at our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, by renewing our interrupted Acquaintances, and expressing the mutual Offices of Love. And lastly, <hi>Charity</hi> at our Departure thence, to be exhibited to those of our absent Brethren, whether here or in the Country, who may any way stand in need of our Assistance.</p>
            <p>We begin this days work with <hi>Godliness,</hi> we are to continue it in <hi>Brotherly Kindness</hi> and I hope to God shall make an end of it in <hi>Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Godliness</hi> to be exercised together with those our fellow-<hi>Christians,</hi> who come to joyn with us in the religious solemnity of the <hi>Day.</hi> This <hi>Brotherly Kindness</hi> amongst <hi>Our selves,</hi> according to the Appointment of our particular <hi>Meeting.</hi> And this <hi>Charity</hi> to be handed to those of our Brethren, whose
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61396:4"/>
wants are to be supplied, that though they are not <hi>Guests,</hi> yet they may be Partakers of our <hi>Love-feast</hi>; that so leaving a <hi>Blessing</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind us, we may all of us carry away a <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> with us to our several homes and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>Now that this our <hi>Meeting</hi> may not be <hi>for the worse,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> complains of his <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.17.</note> but <hi>for the better</hi>; let us <hi>Pray unto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that he would prevent us in all our doings with his most gracious favour, and further us with his continual help, that in all our works of</hi> Piety, Kindness, <hi>and</hi> Charity, <hi>begun, continued, and ended in him, we may glorifie his holy Name, and finally by his mercy obtain everlasting life, through</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In whose Name let us further pray for all our Brethren and Sisters throughout the world, all the sons and daughters of</hi> Adam, <hi>that God, whose mercy is over all his works, would have mercy upon all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>More especially for all of the houshold of Faith, for all our fellow-Citizens of the new</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>for the whole Catholick Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Particularly for that part of it here planted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61396:5"/>
among us; that he would be favourable to our</hi> Sion, <hi>that all that love her and her ways, may prosper, and that all counsels and all weapons formed against her, may ever miscarry and come to nought, as hitherto (praised be his Goodness) they have done; that neither</hi> Popery <hi>nor</hi> Schism <hi>may ever prevail over Her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And herein in a most especial manner, for his most excellent Majesty</hi> CHARLES, <hi>&amp;c. that he would with the choicest of his gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces crown his Royal Head and Heart, that he would preserve his Person, establish his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, direct his Counsels, and prosper his Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings; and that after a long long and happy Reign over us, he would make his Glory great in his Salvation; that he would bless him in his Royal Consort Queen</hi> KATHERINE, <hi>in his Illustrious Brother</hi> JAMES <hi>D. of</hi> York, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let us continue our prayers and enforce our requests for the whole Land and Nation to which we belong, that he would pardon our Sins and heal our Breaches, that neither our Vngodly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations on the one hand, nor our Vncharitable divisions on the other, may ever forfeit or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray that Peace which we do at present enjoy.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61396:5"/>
               <hi>Lastly, let us beg a blessing upon our selves here assembled, that he would grant us his grace so to order our lives with that</hi> Piety <hi>to God, that</hi> Brotherly Kindness <hi>to one another, and that</hi> Charity <hi>to the poor of our Brethren, according to the ability he hath bestowed upon every one of us; and that he would at this time so assist us, both Me the unworthy dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of his Word, and You his beloved People, that both I may so speak,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These and all other our Desires and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements, let us again recommend unto our merciful Father in the Name and Words of his well-beloved Son, saying, as himself hath taught us to pray,</hi> Our Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to Godliness</hi> [add] <hi>Brotherly Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and to Brotherly Kindness, Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apostle having told his Brethren and Country-men, the Convert-<hi>Iews,</hi> (for those were they he writes to, as being the Apostle of the Circumcision) that <hi>through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 3.</note> they had <hi>all things given unto them that pertain unto life and godliness,</hi> and that by those <hi>exceeding great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 4.</note>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61396:6"/>
which were made out to them by him, they might be <hi>partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust</hi>; he puts them in mind what they are more to do in order to this end, what further progress they are to make in their Christian profession,<note place="margin">v. 5.</note> that <hi>besides this</hi> they would <hi>give all diligence, and add to their faith, vertue; and to vertue, knowledge; and to knowledge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 6.</note> 
               <hi>temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, charity.</hi> And then tells them in the two following verses, that <hi>if these things be in them and abound, they will make them that they shall not be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Iesus Christ</hi>; that is, that they should not be idle, empty, formal Professors of the Gospel, but <hi>true Christians</hi> indeed, who evidence and justifie their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession by their conversation: and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, that <hi>he that lacketh these things, hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins</hi>; that is, his Christianity, notwithstanding his having been baptized, and his having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Gospel, does him no good, stands
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61396:6"/>
him in no stead, nor so much as serves to distinguish him from other common men, from ordinary Heathens; but leaves him, as it found him, still in his sins: and then <hi>v.</hi> 10. presses the practice of these things, as the onely way to <hi>make their calling and election sure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I go to treat particularly of these three several <hi>Vertues</hi> or <hi>Graces</hi> here recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us, give me leave to give you some account of them first in the <hi>General,</hi> partly from the <hi>Context,</hi> as they are reckon'd up with other graces; and partly from the <hi>Text</hi> it self, as they depend upon and cohere with one another.</p>
            <p>In the whole <hi>Context</hi> the Apostle hath set down, as you have heard, no less than <hi>eight</hi> distinct characters or qualifications requisite to constitute and denominate a man a sincere <hi>Christian,</hi> one truly Religious; to wit, <hi>Faith, Vertue, Knowledge, Temperance, Patience, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, Brotherly Kindness,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> as the Complement and Consummation of all.</p>
            <p>From whence I draw this <hi>Corollary,</hi>That true <hi>Religion</hi> is in its nature an Accumulative and Comprehensive thing, that doth not consist
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61396:7"/>
in any one single Act, or simple Habit, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a Complex of <hi>Vertues,</hi> a Constellation of <hi>Graces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Text</hi> it self we find three of these <hi>Vertues</hi> or <hi>Graces</hi> in a more indearing manner joyn'd together, <hi>Godliness, Brotherly Kindness,</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence I gather this <hi>Remark,</hi> That <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> that is, Piety towards God, is not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose, ill-natured, and humorous principle, as too many peradventure have taken it to be, but that which requires to be accompanied with acts of <hi>Kindness</hi> and works of <hi>Charity</hi> to our Brethren and fellow-members, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those who stand in some nearer rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us, to whom therefore we have more particular obligations.</p>
            <p n="1">I. First for the <hi>Context,</hi> that <hi>Religion</hi> is a thing of an Accumulative and Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive nature, appears by the Apostles reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up several Ingredients and Integral parts for the making up the Body of it. I shall not dare to say, that it was S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s designe in this place to make an exact and compleat Enumeration of those <hi>Vertues,</hi> which are to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61396:7"/>
make up the truth of <hi>Religion:</hi> as may be made out by those other Lists and Catalogues, which his Brother S. <hi>Paul</hi> has given us, <hi>Gal.</hi> V. 22, 23. and elsewhere; in which we shall find some of these here named by him omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and others mentioned by him, here not taken notice of. It was enough for the ones and the others purpose, to lay down some of the principal, wherein the main of <hi>Religion</hi> lies.</p>
            <p>However, this is evident, and plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from them both, that there is <hi>cumulus virtutum,</hi> an accumulation of <hi>Virtues,</hi> an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of good things, requisite to intitle a man to the truth of <hi>Religion,</hi> to make him deserve the name of one truly Religious.</p>
            <p>And thus is it in common <hi>Morality,</hi> where they tell us that all the <hi>virtues</hi> are so insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly linked together, that where any one is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, there is really no one of them. Nay, even in the performance of any single <hi>act</hi> of any one <hi>vertue,</hi> there is that complex consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of all the <hi>circumstances,</hi> according to the <hi>Philosophers</hi> definition of them, that it be done <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in that <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and at such <hi>time,</hi> and according to such
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61396:8"/>
               <hi>proportions</hi> as it ought to be done, to make it a vertuous act. This also founded upon a general <hi>Maxim</hi> or Rule, among the <hi>Moralists,</hi> that <hi>Bonum ex integrâ causâ, Malum ex quovis defectu</hi>; that any <hi>Good</hi> action must proceed from an intire cause, and that the defect of any one circumstance spoils the action, and makes it to become <hi>Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be so in meer <hi>Moral</hi> practices, much more is it so in <hi>Religious</hi> concerns, since <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is the Improvement and Perfection of <hi>Morality,</hi> as <hi>Faith</hi> is the Directer and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisher of <hi>Reason.</hi> It is not then any one simple <hi>Habit,</hi> any one single <hi>Act</hi> can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title any one to the truth of <hi>Religion</hi> any more than to <hi>Morality,</hi> which are either of them to be made up of a complex of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> that are, as the <hi>Poets</hi> fancied of the <hi>Graces,</hi> to go hand in hand, and to keep their orderly rounds, and to give their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual assistances in the conduct and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Humane</hi> or <hi>Christian</hi> life.</p>
            <p>It is true, he who hath <hi>Faith,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves Gospel-mysteries, and professes this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, has upon that bare account a title to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61396:8"/>
               <hi>Christianity</hi> as to the external priviledge of it; but that is not enough to denominate him a true <hi>Christian,</hi> unless he go on, and add to his <hi>faith, vertue.</hi> And he who is <hi>Vertuous,</hi> who orders his conversation vertuously, may in some sense be called an honest <hi>Good</hi> man; but then he must add to his <hi>vertue, knowledge.</hi> And he who is a <hi>knowing</hi> man, and has gotten a competent <hi>Theory</hi> of the <hi>Credenda</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda,</hi> things to be believed and things to be done, of the <hi>mysteries</hi> and <hi>duties</hi> of Religion, may be said to be a <hi>Wise</hi> understanding man; but then he must add to his <hi>knowledge, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi>; or else his knowledge will be no more than what the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> boasted of, a sort of Hereticks who though so named from their pretended knowledge, yet lived in all kind of impurities. Again, he who is <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> and restrains his natural desires, may so far be looked upon as a <hi>Sober</hi> person; but then he must add to his <hi>temperance, patience,</hi> for the indurance of afflictions, as well as the forbearance of pleasures. And he who is <hi>Patient,</hi> and humbly submits to the divine will in his chastisements or trials, may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well taken to be a <hi>Meek</hi> man, which is one
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61396:9"/>
of the chief marks of a right Christian spirit; but then he must add to his <hi>patience, godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> Now he that is <hi>Godly,</hi> that fears God, and often comes before him in his private and publick addresses, frequents his Church and Ordinances, and orderly performs the duties of family and closet, he surely has made a fair advance in Religion, and may and must be thought a <hi>Pious</hi> man; but then to his <hi>godliness</hi> he must add <hi>brotherly kindness.</hi> And he that has a love for the <hi>Brotherhood,</hi> is cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and gentle, and mild in his converse, and well-meaning to all of the same Society, may not improperly be term'd a <hi>Good-natured</hi> man, a thing which is so far from being a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage or disparagement, that it is a great ornament to Religion; but then he must to <hi>brotherly kindness</hi> add <hi>charity.</hi> And now we are come to the very topstone of this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual edifice, to the very pitch of perfection; <hi>Charity</hi> being the fulfilling of the Law, both <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Christian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here you find that to <hi>Faith</hi> is to be added <hi>Vertue,</hi> to <hi>Vertue Knowledge,</hi> and so on; which rationally infers, that not any one or more of these will serve turn without the other. So
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61396:9"/>
then it is not enough to be a <hi>Believer,</hi> to be <hi>Virtuous,</hi> to be <hi>Knowing,</hi> to be <hi>Temperate,</hi> to be <hi>Patient,</hi> to be <hi>Godly,</hi> to be <hi>Brotherly kind,</hi> to be <hi>Charitable</hi>; I say it is not sufficient for a man to be any one of these, but he must be all these, if he will be a good <hi>Christian,</hi> and mean to deserve the name of one truly <hi>Religious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much of the <hi>first</hi> general head; the <hi>second</hi> is that which more nearly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately concerns us, which is gathered out of the <hi>Text</hi> it self, that</p>
            <p n="2">2. Inasmuch as the <hi>Apostle</hi> here requires <hi>Brotherly Kindness</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> to be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to <hi>Godliness</hi>; that <hi>Godliness</hi> is not a morose, humorous, ill-natured, much less a cruel, mischievous and bloudy principle; but must, to make it a true genuine godliness, be attended with acts of <hi>Kindness</hi> and works of <hi>Charity.</hi> So S. <hi>Peter</hi> himself, in his 1 Ep. ch. 2. v. 17. <hi>Love the Brotherhood. Fear God,</hi> and then <hi>Honour the King</hi> as Gods Vicegerent and Lord of the Community. As if there could be no right <hi>fear of God</hi> without <hi>love of the brotherhood,</hi> and neither one nor other without a due <hi>honour to the King,</hi> the Head of the brotherhood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:61396:10"/>In like manner S. <hi>Paul</hi> resolves all Religion into <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi>;<note place="margin">Philem. 5.</note> faith toward the Lord Jesus, and love toward the Saints, which make up his mystical body, whereof we are all fellow-members; for in this sense we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to believe the <hi>communion of Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so the beloved Disciple tells us, that <hi>this is Gods commandment,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.23.</note> 
               <hi>that we should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Lord Iesus, and love one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Christ</hi> himself hath stated the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Religion,<note place="margin">Joh. 8.31.</note> 
               <hi>If ye continue in my Word,</hi> that is, keep my commandments, <hi>then are ye my disciples indeed.</hi> And how's that? in another place he says it over in these words, <hi>By this shall all men know,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 13.35</note> 
               <hi>that ye are my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, if ye love one another.</hi> It seems then, that our loving one another is the same thing as continuing in his Word, as keeping his Commandments: and hereupon it is said that <hi>love is the fulfilling of the law.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.10</note> This was that <hi>new commandment,</hi> Christ brought into the world,<note place="margin">Joh. 13.34</note> that we should <hi>love one another.</hi> This the great <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and tryal of our love to God, of our <hi>godliness</hi> it self, that we love the brethren,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.20.</note> as he tells us; <hi>For,</hi> saies he, <hi>he who loves not his brother whom he hath seen,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61396:10"/>
how can he</hi> pretend to <hi>love God, whom he hath not seen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is this so a <hi>new</hi> commandment, as himself acknowledges,<note place="margin">2 Joh. 5.</note> but that it was an <hi>old</hi> one too. For our Saviour's Ancestor <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in his short Catechism, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. has given much-what the same account of Religion. <hi>Lord,</hi> saies he, <hi>who shall abide in thy taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?</hi> i. e. who has a right to the priviledges of the Church <hi>militant?</hi> who has assurance of an everlasting possession in the Church <hi>trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant?</hi> He answers this question in the four following verses. <hi>He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour</hi>; and so on. Which are all or most part of them expresses of <hi>brotherly kindness</hi> and <hi>charity:</hi> and then in the close he tells us, that <hi>He which doth these things shall never fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then we are to <hi>love God with all our heart and strength</hi>; that's <hi>Godliness:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 10.17</note> and <hi>our neighbour as our selves</hi>; that's <hi>Brotherly kindness and Charity:</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> himself hath summ'd up the duties of the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:61396:11"/>And many other such passages there are in Scripture to evince this truth, had I time to insist on them.</p>
            <p>If this be so, what shall we say to those who take up <hi>Godliness</hi> on other terms, as if their strictness and zeal to God's service, to his <hi>worship,</hi> right or wrong, excused them from all offices of <hi>love</hi> to their fellow-men, their fellow-christians; nay, obliged them to be <hi>Vnkind,</hi> to be <hi>Vncharitable,</hi> and to persecute even to death those, who, not out of any evil meaning to them, <hi>will not,</hi> but out of conscience to God <hi>dare not</hi> comply with sinful conditions of communion with them.</p>
            <p>This was foretold by our blessed Lord should be the lot of his followers, that some such <hi>zealots</hi> there would be,<note place="margin">Joh. 16.2.</note> who would <hi>turn them out of the Synagogue,</hi> excommunicate them for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and then <hi>kill</hi> them, and yet by their so doing would think <hi>they did God good service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Blessed <hi>Iesu!</hi> where have these men, who take thy holy Name in vain, these <hi>Fellows</hi> of thine, (for so they stile themselves,) learnt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61396:11"/>
of thee such principles, such practices as these, that it is lawful so cruelly and treacherously to deal with men who live quietly by them? with S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Sword to destroy them from off the face of the earth, and with S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Keys to lock the gates of Heaven against them? to murder them in this world, and to damn them in the next? This <hi>Evangelium armatum,</hi> this Sanguinary doctrine, was no <hi>Gospel</hi> of thy making, no <hi>doctrine</hi> of thy tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. Thy doctrine was sealed with no <hi>bloud</hi> but that of thy own, who wast the <hi>tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> of it, and that of thy <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> who were the <hi>propagators</hi> of it; and though thou saidst thou camest <hi>not to send peace but a sword,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 10.34</note> yet that <hi>sword</hi> was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to fight with, but to suffer by; it was a <hi>sword</hi> of a <hi>passive</hi> not of an <hi>active</hi> perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution as to thy Disciples, by which they were to fall victims themselves, and not to sacrifice the lives of others.</p>
            <p>How contrary to thine and their meek in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent methods of converting souls, are the traiterous contrivances and hellish conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of those who for the advantage of <hi>Holy Church,</hi> plot the murder of Kings, the slaughter
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61396:12"/>
of Subjects, and the ruine of States, and (rare <hi>Masters of Christianity,</hi> as they are) think it glorious to <hi>Proselyte</hi> whole Nations by baptizing them in their <hi>bloud.</hi> May God ever preserve his gracious <hi>Majesty</hi> and Us the sinful people of this <hi>Land</hi> from such villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Attempts of his and our Enemies.</p>
            <p>I know the like <hi>Bigotries</hi> and <hi>Outrages</hi> are charged upon our <hi>Sectaries</hi> even at this time, and that with great vehemence. I am hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily sorry, that any, who delight to wear the name of <hi>Protestants,</hi> as I think most of those people do, should give a just occasion for such a charge. But if it be so, if there shall be any danger hereafter on that side, as there hath been lately on the other, may God in good time discover it as he hath done the other, and avert and defeat them both. For as I have been speaking my utmost abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Iesuitical</hi> principles, so I am very far from pleading the cause of any party of men, be they of what denomination soever, who act by such principles.</p>
            <p>No; nor would I, nor can I without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, be so understood, that in the scope and drift of this discourse I intended a shelter and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61396:12"/>
defence for <hi>Schism</hi>; as if the sober execution of <hi>penal laws</hi> upon offenders in <hi>Church</hi> as well as <hi>State,</hi> were the same thing with that irregular, <hi>Vnchristian, Inhumane persecution,</hi> I have been declaring against; the case being quite different betwixt the wicked efforts of an Usurped pretended power <hi>without us,</hi> and the prudential proceedings of a lawful autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>over us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though truly after all it cannot be denied, (with grief I speak it) and so far at least this Charge must be owned, that since we have run our selves into these <hi>divisions,</hi> wherein we now stand, the pretence of <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> has almost banished all <hi>brotherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> from among us.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I have done with the <hi>General</hi> part. I come now to treat of these vertues severally; <hi>Godliness, Brotherly kindness,</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Godliness</hi> in reference to God, <hi>Brotherly kindness</hi> to one another, and <hi>Charity</hi> to all men, especially to our Poor.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>GODLINESS</hi> in the first place, that our <hi>Brotherly kindness</hi> may be inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, and our <hi>Charity</hi> acceptable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:61396:13"/>Now there are as several sorts of <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> in vulgar acception of the word, as there are of <hi>Religions</hi> in the world. At this rate there are godly <hi>Pagans,</hi> godly <hi>Turks,</hi> godly <hi>Papists,</hi> godly <hi>Hereticks</hi> , and godly <hi>Schismaticks.</hi> Nay, upon this account per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance the <hi>Devils</hi> themselves in some sense are not to be quite exempted from some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of godliness;<note place="margin">Jam. 2.19.</note> for <hi>they believe and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> they have a kind of Religion amongst them too, and though they do not love God, they believe and fear him.</p>
            <p>I make no doubt to believe what our S. <hi>Peter</hi> hath affirm'd, and to say it after him, that <hi>Now know I of a truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 10.35.</note> saies he, <hi>that God is no respecter of persons, and that in every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he that fears God and works righteousness,</hi> (whatever his way of worship be, if he does not know or has not the means to know any better) <hi>is accepted of him:</hi> This is but the <hi>judgment of charity.</hi> But to think or say that an <hi>Infidel</hi> as an <hi>Infidel,</hi> a <hi>Mahometan</hi> as a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan,</hi> and so of the rest, that a <hi>Papist,</hi> a <hi>Heretick,</hi> or a <hi>Schismatick,</hi> as such, is in a salvable condition, is such a fondness of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that it can be little better it self than
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61396:13"/>
an heretical, a damnable opinion. I am sure it is not the <hi>judgment of discretion,</hi> as being no where warranted by the Word of God, and having been anathematized by our <hi>Church</hi> in her <hi>Articles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Godliness</hi> then doth not consist in a <hi>form,</hi> in the mode or dress of worship. That's but external and ceremonious: yet a <hi>form</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; and it is impossible to serve God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, that is, without some form or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. However, as necessary as a <hi>Form</hi> is to <hi>Godliness,</hi> 'tis not essential; for which reason it may be supposed our Saviour himself did not think fit to appoint any form, but lest it to the prudence of his <hi>Apostles</hi> in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral districts and provinces, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to particular <hi>Churches, pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> to determine. And herein, as I take it, lies the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Schism,</hi> for men wilfully to depart from that publick <hi>form</hi> of worship, which the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of that <hi>Church</hi> they belong to hath prescribed, and so to dismember themselves from their own body.</p>
            <p>And upon this ground we of the <hi>Church of England</hi> may acquit our selves, and justifie our separation from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> as the bold
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61396:14"/>
               <hi>British Bishops</hi> did, when they gave a mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Austin</hi> the Popes Missionary at a place in our County, thence called <hi>Austins Oke,</hi> which <hi>Cambden</hi> owns, but confesses he knows not where to fix; where they did with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual truth and bravery disdain the <hi>Popes</hi> ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction over the <hi>British</hi> Churches: I say, we may answer the <hi>Romanists,</hi> when they charge us with <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Schism,</hi> in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, [as having no dependance upon the <hi>Pope,</hi> unless we will foolishly inslave our selves] that <hi>according to that way which they call Heresie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 24.14.</note> 
               <hi>we worship the God of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, some <hi>forms</hi> are in themselves faulty; but the best of forms is not of it self saving, sufficient to salvation: since the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle tells us,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.5.</note> that some <hi>having the form of godliness, deny the power thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then Godliness doth not consist in a form, much less doth it in cant and gibbrish, in affected tones and uncouth phrases. No, <hi>Godliness</hi> lies in the <hi>heart</hi> and the <hi>life</hi> of a Christian; there's the <hi>power</hi> and the truth of it.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Heart</hi> is possest with a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential

               <hi>aw</hi> of the divine <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>majesty,</hi> and <hi>justice,</hi> and with the <hi>love</hi> of his <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>goodness,</hi> and all the <hi>affections</hi> are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised upon his adorable perfections: And yet still these possessions of heart, our good intentions and pious directions of mind are not enough, but must be set forth to the <hi>life</hi> in our lives, if we will be truely godly. For 'tis a <hi>godly life,</hi> that is, the life of <hi>godliness.</hi> The Apostle tells us of some that live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world. Those are in the strictest sense the <hi>ungodly ones:</hi> and he warns us to <hi>deny ungodly</hi> lusts.<note place="margin">Tit. 2.12.</note> That's right <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then more particularly <hi>Godliness</hi> is made out in the publick worship of God. So 'tis said of <hi>Enos</hi> his time,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.25.</note> that then began men <hi>to call upon the name of the Lord,</hi> that is, to worship him in solemn assemblies, and in publick devotions. And this <hi>godliness,</hi> when we can once agree in Gods publick worship, will beget and confirm <hi>brotherly kindness,</hi> which is the next vertue to be spoken to.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>BROTHERLY KINDNESS. Brother</hi> in Scripture-use is not always taken in that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61396:15"/>
narrow sense of relation &amp; kindred, but many times comprehends all mankind, as we are all descended of <hi>Adam.</hi> Especially it denotes those of <hi>the houshold of faith</hi>; this being the neerest tye and strictest obligation of brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. And O that we, who own our selves <hi>Christians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 133.1.</note> 
               <hi>Protestants,</hi> might as <hi>brethren</hi> dwell together in unity, that we might go to the house of God in company,<note place="margin">Psal. 55.14.</note> &amp; take sweet coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel together. But alas! as we stand divided, how can we call our selves <hi>brethren?</hi> Such <hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> we may be as <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Iacob, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ishmael, Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> were, to hate, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute, and ruine one another, if occasion were offered. Surely, surely, those who have deserted our Establishments, we may and must call them <hi>English brethren</hi>; but how to call them <hi>Protestant brethren</hi> I do not well know; for of them I may say, what S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saies of some in his time,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.19</note> that <hi>if they had been of us, they would not have departed from us.</hi> However, we must have a love and kindness for them too, and this <hi>Kindness</hi> to our <hi>brethren</hi> is to be exprest in thought, word, and action.</p>
            <p>That we <hi>think</hi> the best of them, put the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61396:15"/>
best interpretation upon their actions, that we <hi>wish</hi> them well, rejoyce in their well-doing, and condole their ills: and this is that which by the <hi>Schools</hi> is called <hi>amor benevolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> the love of good will.</p>
            <p>That we <hi>speak</hi> the best of them according to the judgment of charity, and that we judg not, for fear of being judged.<note place="margin">Mat. 7.1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That we <hi>do</hi> them all manner of good; for this is the royal law, to do as we would be done by. And thus our blessed Lord, who as he was our <hi>elder brother,</hi> the first-born of the creation, so was the <hi>author</hi> of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>; he went about doing good,<note place="margin">Act. 10.38.</note> and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king opportunities of doing it.</p>
            <p>Where this <hi>brotherly kindness</hi> is, there will be no grudg and hatred, no envy or malice at the <hi>heart,</hi> no calumny and detraction, no slander and reproach in the <hi>tongue,</hi> no quarrel and strife, no mischief or injury in <hi>action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then this <hi>kindness</hi> must not proceed so far as to degenerate into a sinful compliance with our brothers sins. This would make us <hi>brethren in iniquity.</hi> This the Apostle taxes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. the last verse; speaking of those who <hi>have pleasure</hi> in them that do evil

things, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that <hi>consent with them</hi>; as the Psalmist says,<note place="margin">Psal. 50.18</note> 
               <hi>Thou sawest a thief, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentedst with him.</hi> To be drunk with the drunken, to fit with patience and hear my brother blaspheme God and damn his own soul, to see him run down a precipice, blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into a pit, and take the ready way for hell, and not lay hold of him and pull him back, this is such <hi>brotherly kindness</hi> as the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> himself has for any man in the world. What saies the rule in <hi>Leviticus?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 19.17</note> 
               <hi>Thou shalt love thy brother, and not suffer sin upon him</hi>; That's the truest of loves. Hence, <hi>Correptio fraterna,</hi> brotherly reproof in such cases is reckon'd to be one of the chief acts of <hi>Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O my <hi>dear Brethren,</hi> let it not be said of us, that we meet for excess and riot, for noise and quarrel; but rather let it be seen by our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that we come together upon a <hi>religious,</hi> a <hi>brotherly,</hi> and a <hi>charitable</hi> account.</p>
            <p>And that's the thing we are all to conclude with; where let me beg your <hi>patience</hi> as well as <hi>charity,</hi> that you will not think me tedious, whilst I inlarge my self upon this blessed sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>charity.</hi>

               <hi>Thou</hi> art the very foundation and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Christian Religion, who with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite activity <hi>fulfillest</hi> all God's <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Thou</hi> art the very band and ligament of <hi>Peace,</hi> who preservest and securest all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests of mankind, their lives and liberties, their plenty and prosperity in their several societies and stations.</p>

               <hi>Thou</hi> with an omnipotence equal to Gods, bearest all things, indurest all things, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest and hopest all things.</p>
            <p>And at last, after thou hast wrought thy mighty and glorious acts of kindness here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>thou</hi> shalt ascend in triumph through the spangled vault, and shalt enter into heaven with a train of thy good works following

thee, leaving thy two <hi>sister-graces</hi> behind thee at heaven-gate; for in that blessed state of <hi>Vision</hi> and <hi>Fruition</hi> there will be no need of either <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Hope,</hi> where thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, O <hi>Charity,</hi> together with the <hi>Three-One God,</hi> shalt be <hi>all in all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But hold! what mean I in this transport to lose thee by inquiring after thee? What did I say? lose thee? I have found thee. I see thee. <hi>Thou</hi> art (blessed be God) come into the Congregation, and with thy gracious presence hast fill'd the Church. I see thy holy flame sitting on each pious breast, and inlivening and inlarging every devout heart with its heavenly warmth. Let me now therefore look out for <hi>objects</hi> upon which thou mayst bestow thy blessed self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charity</hi> is of that diffusive nature, that it extends it self to all <hi>mankind,</hi> as being the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manation of divine goodness, which is as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite as God himself is; and more especially reacheth its kindly effects over the whole <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> to all of the houshold of faith; it being that which unites and ties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all the members of that mystical body.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61396:18"/>
But I am not now to speak of it in that lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sense, but in an importance appropriate to the <hi>Poor</hi> of our <hi>Brethren,</hi> whom God hath appointed his <hi>Receivers,</hi> as he hath made the <hi>Rich</hi> his <hi>Trustees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That,</hi> to wit, that the Poor are his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, appears by the account <hi>Christ,</hi> who himself is to be the Judge, gives us of the last judgment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. that what we do to any of our poor Brethren, he takes it as done to himself; and upon this score it is said,<note place="margin">Prov. 19.17.</note> 
               <hi>He that giveth to the poor, lendeth to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This,</hi> to wit, that the Rich are but his Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stees, is made good by the parable of the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,</hi> which the only way of improving, is to lay them out; and by that charge the Apostle gives, <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world that they do good,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.17.</note> 
               <hi>that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</hi> &amp;c. Why charge them to do so, if it be not their duty so to do?</p>
            <p>This kind of <hi>charity</hi> is exprest in feeding the hungry, in cloathing the naked, in visiting the sick, in relieving the widow and father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and generally in supplying the wants of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61396:18"/>
all those, especially in the circle of our own society and brotherhood, who any way want our assistance. And this <hi>charity</hi> it is, that as in this world it <hi>sanctifies, improves,</hi> and <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures</hi> estates to men and their posterities after them; so in the next world will be that, by which <hi>eternal rewards</hi> will be adjusted to men, as you find in that fore-cited place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>Let me conclude this argument for <hi>charity</hi> with a blessed Promise,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.7.</note> that <hi>the merciful shall obtain mercy</hi>; and a severe Threat, that those who have shewn no mercy, are to expect in their greatest distress at the day of judgment, <hi>justice without mercy</hi> from a righteous God.</p>
            <p>Onely let me add, that those (for there is such a sort of well-minded persons in the world) that <hi>put off</hi> their doing good works till they die, besides that they may by some sudden unexpected accident be cut off from putting their good intentions into execution, ought to consider that their charity is not so thankworthy, that they give then, when they can hold no longer: The surest rule is, to be continually doing good, as occasions shall offer themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:61396:19"/>Now as to the <hi>objects</hi> of our charity, I am perswaded we have enow of them within our own sphere, I mean of our native Country. It is the opinion of some, that the <hi>object</hi> presented doth lay a necessity upon the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Will. I wish it were so in the business of charity. Shall I lay some <hi>instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> before you?</p>
            <p>There are poor <hi>Livings,</hi> poor <hi>Schools,</hi> where the <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Masters</hi> are so far from having an honorable allowance, that they have scarce a bare subsistance. But these things of a <hi>publick</hi> concern are such, as I fear our <hi>annual</hi> contributions will hardly reach to: Though I have a prospect, what hereafter may be done, if we ever come to get such a bank, a stock, as may be called a <hi>Mount of Piety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>Ministers</hi> poor <hi>Widows</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans,</hi> poor <hi>aged persons</hi> to be taken care of, having no ability to help themselves; and poor <hi>Children</hi> to be educated and bred up to Callings; of which kind of charity an Eminent <hi>Country-man</hi> of ours hath shewn a great and lasting Example, and by that means rais'd a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61396:19"/>
Monument to his own Name amongst us, and I doubt not intail'd a great Blessing upon his whole Family.</p>
            <p>Well; but what do I? do I take upon me to direct? No: but I am set here to give aim. It must be left to the prudence of those <hi>worthy persons</hi> (with submission to whose better judgment I speak in this case) I say 'tis left to their discretion, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with the disposal of our Charities, to make application of them, as they shall think fit. Only let me be bold to name to you two sorts of <hi>Poor,</hi> and press in their behalf, who may most properly challenge a share in them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Clothworking</hi> trade has been one of the glories of <hi>Worcester</hi>-shire, and has main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd when time was many families, who are now I fear most of them impoverished through want either of Employment or Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The reason of it possibly may be this, that our <hi>Staple</hi> is betrai'd into forrein hands; and that <hi>strangers,</hi> what by their thrift and other crafts, under-sell us in the manufacture of our own commodity. It will be a thing very well becoming you, <hi>Worthy Country-men,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:61396:20"/>
and no less agreeable to the place where you are to meet, <hi>Drapers Hall,</hi> to take this into your consideration.</p>
            <p>Another sort which I must heartily recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you, is the <hi>Royal Sufferers,</hi> I mean the <hi>old Cavaliers</hi>; I pray God there may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be any occasion for <hi>new</hi> ones; those who have spent their bloud, and exhausted their estates in the service of their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> I cannot forbear, though it be to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick shame, but speak it with grief, that that sort of men have since the Kings happy <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration</hi> been too too much neglected: when brave persons with their <hi>scars,</hi> the marks of their Loyalty upon them, have been forced to beg their bread, with that great unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate General, <hi>Date obolum Belisario,</hi> I, and have perished for want of it. And though that were so long ago, as by this time to put former merits out of mind, and many if not most perhaps of those <hi>Sufferers</hi> have been eaten up with their wants, and gone in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content to their long homes, and so preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our Charity; yet some no question of that number have survived their hard fate, and have been by some extraordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence kept alive; who knows but for the comfort of this day?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61396:20"/>Come, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> our <hi>City</hi> and <hi>County</hi> has been famous for its <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Sufferings,</hi> having been one of the first Stages of the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War,</hi> to fight for gasping Monarchy; and at last the Scene of that fatal <hi>Defeat,</hi> when the God of our <hi>Dread Soveraign,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 33.16.</note> who <hi>dwelt in the Bush,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 140.7.</note> covered his head in the day of Battle, and secured his escape amidst the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med throngs of his enemies that had beset him. I leave it with you; onely remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring you, that we are met here this day for the honour of our <hi>Country,</hi> and we cannot do her a greater Honour, than by owning di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and relieving those who have been <hi>Sufferers</hi> upon that honorable account.</p>
            <p>Briefly to <hi>recapitulate</hi> all that I have been say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>Apostle</hi> has sum'd up all Religion in three words, That we live <hi>godly, righteously,</hi> and <hi>soberly</hi>;<note place="margin">Tit. 2.12.</note> which is much what the same with my Text. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> in the fear and service of God. <hi>Righteously,</hi> by doing by others as we would be done by our selves; which includes <hi>Charity,</hi> when out of compassion we make the poors condition our own. And <hi>Soberly,</hi> without riot or debosh, without quarrel and strife; which is the truest and best <hi>Brotherly Kindness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And these three things are those by which the three great <hi>Interests</hi> of mankind are provided for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61396:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and secured; <hi>Soul, Body,</hi> and <hi>Estate.</hi> For what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of saving our <hi>souls,</hi> but by serving of God, by <hi>Godliness?</hi> What better Rule of <hi>Health</hi> can there be than Temperance or <hi>Sobriety?</hi> and what so likely a method of improving and securing <hi>Wealth</hi> as <hi>Charity,</hi> which lays up our treasure in heaven,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.20.</note> where neither corruption can attaint it, nor violence invade it? So the Poet himself, <q>Extra fortunam est quicquid donatur.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whatsoever a man bestows to charitable uses, he puts it out of the power, and beyond the reach of fortune.</p>
            <p>Now as you have with patience and cheerfulness attended the duties of the Church, which is one part of <hi>Godliness</hi>; so may your <hi>brotherly kindness</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised together without excess or tumult, and may your <hi>charity</hi> now, as it ought after so many years in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission, be liberal and exemplary.</p>
            <p>Thus if you do, you will assuredly, as I said at first, by leaving a <hi>Blessing</hi> behind you, carry one home along with you; and I also (which is the last part of what I have to do) may in a just confidence dismiss you with a Blessing.</p>
