            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency</hi> of the <hi>Smectymnuan</hi> faction, by lopping off what they called <hi>Luxuriant Branches</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> made an easie way to take away <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Branch,</hi> and soon after to verifie the <hi>Aphorism, No Bishop, no King.</hi> And now <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> are restored to their just power, and God hath heard graciously the weak <hi>Prayers</hi> of an <hi>oppressed party,</hi> beyond the <hi>loud-crying Perjuries, Sacriledges</hi> and <hi>oppressions</hi> of their <hi>enemies,</hi> we cannot misdoubt (what troubles the <hi>Animadverter)</hi> so <hi>insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> a <hi>dependance,</hi> so <hi>strict</hi> an <hi>Union</hi> betwixt <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> that <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> and <hi>Disloyalty</hi> may no longer reign in them, nor <hi>Perjury, Sacriledge,</hi> and <hi>Oppression,</hi> exercise an <hi>arbitrary soveraignty</hi> over us.</p>

               <hi>Monster</hi> of deep <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason!</hi> This is no <hi>ordinary Call,</hi> which makes him speak such strange <hi>truths</hi> against <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> and <hi>Interest.</hi> Page 2. <hi>Much</hi> (he saith) <hi>he is in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Order of Bishops, a passionate lover of the King and his Government.</hi> Sute, having <hi>run</hi> out of his <hi>wits</hi> to make room for an <hi>heretical spirit,</hi> he must obey the <hi>impulsion,</hi> that he may be the fitter <hi>Champion</hi> for Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> producing <hi>Arguments</hi> of no more <hi>consequence</hi> then his. The <hi>Kingly Office</hi> will prove as <hi>undue,</hi> and <hi>Prelation</hi> be thought as much <hi>Antichristian,</hi> as this of his <hi>Inferior Officers;</hi> since <hi>Nihil dat quod non habet, and</hi> (as the <hi>Animadverter) Bishops are purely the Kings subordinate Ministers, in the management of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Affairs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Presbyter</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> suppose they have sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>confuted</hi> whatsoever they <hi>mislike,</hi> if they <hi>pronounce</hi> it <hi>Popish</hi> or <hi>Antichristian.</hi> Yet in this, as in other things, they <hi>sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolize</hi> with the <hi>Papists,</hi> and divide the branch of <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianism.</hi> The <hi>Presbyterian Consistories</hi> claim as ample and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction</hi> over <hi>Princes,</hi> and power to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate</hi> them, as Papists challenge due to the <hi>Pope. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents</hi> exempt their <hi>Congregations,</hi> as <hi>Pontisicians</hi> their <hi>Clergy.</hi> Our <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Conformists</hi> pretend neither <hi>Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> over the <hi>King,</hi> nor <hi>Allegiance</hi> to be withdrawn from <hi>him;</hi> but in all <hi>matters,</hi> either <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to have the <hi>supreme power.</hi> The <hi>injury</hi> then to the <hi>Kings power</hi> is, that the <hi>Bishops</hi> are <hi>good Subjects,</hi> and <hi>good Christians;</hi> or that they have a <hi>preheminence</hi> in <hi>power,</hi> that there may not be as many <hi>Schisms</hi> as <hi>Priests.</hi> Sure the <hi>Kings interest</hi> stands not with the <hi>Devils</hi> and a <hi>Tyrants,</hi> to <hi>divide</hi> by <hi>Sects,</hi> least all may unite against <hi>Him,</hi> but to <hi>unite</hi> all, that they may agree in the <hi>service</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and of him who is <hi>Gods Vicegerent.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:53120:4"/>
Thirdly, <hi>Bishops are little useful to support the Regal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, being the greatest enemies to Soveraignty; intermedling in Civil affairs, and mangling the Church Authority in Church matters, leaving the King nothing of Supremacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had not this <hi>trifler</hi> been lost as much to good Books as Brains, he might have learned of the most eminent B. <hi>Saunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, That derived power is so far from destroying the original from whence it is derived, as it rather confirmeth and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it.</hi> The farther it is extended, so it be regular, the more it serveth to <hi>illustrate</hi> the <hi>honor</hi> of the <hi>original;</hi> since the <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause</hi> is best known by the <hi>greatness</hi> of the <hi>effect:</hi> For, <hi>Propter quod unumquodque est tale, illud ipsum est magis tale.</hi> And did not the <hi>valor</hi> of this <hi>Champion</hi> proceed only from his <hi>ignorance,</hi> when <hi>Protestant Bishops</hi> only profess, maintain and submit to <hi>Regal Supremacy,</hi> he could not thus <hi>whiffle</hi> to no greater purpose, then the calling of his <hi>Brains</hi> into question.</p>
