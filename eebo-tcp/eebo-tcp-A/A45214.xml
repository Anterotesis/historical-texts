         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Tell me, brethren, Do ye like, or beleeve this aſſertion, becauſe a Pope ſaid it?

It is a foule ſclander to charge the name of Epiſcopacy with a faction, for the fact imputed to ſome few. Fie brethren, are ye Presbyters of the Church of England, and dare challenge Epiſcopacie of faction? Had you ſpoken but ſuch a word in the time of holy <hi>Cyprian,</hi> whom you frequently cite, as a patterne of good diſcipline, what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you?

Additions</hi> and <hi>Alterations?</hi> What in the preſent Liturgie? where or what? tell me, I beſeech you brethren, are they viſible, or are they not? If not, how come ye to ſee them? if ſo, why cannot we? perhaps ſomewhere in ſtead of <hi>Prieſt,</hi> there is <hi>Miniſter</hi>; perhaps <hi>Abſolution</hi> is interpreted by a <hi>Remiſsion</hi>; perhaps in private baptiſme, there is mention of a <hi>lawfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>; perhaps in ſtead of <hi>Purification of women,</hi> there is <hi>Thankſgiving</hi>; And can ye know the Book when ye ſee it again, after theſe <hi>Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> theſe <hi>Additions?

                     <p>And why ſhould not I ſpeake of Martyrs, as the Authors and uſers of this holy Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie? why ſhould not we glory in their name and Authority? ſleight you them as you pleaſe, we bleſſe God for ſuch Patrons of our good cauſe: What a poore returne is

this? Whiles I tell you what our holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs did, You tell me what one of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſaid; As if we were bound to make good every word that falls from the mouth of every Biſhop: Even of the beſt man we may ſay as the Pſalmiſt doth of <hi>Moſes, effutiit labiis,</hi> he ſpake unadviſedly with his lips; As for the words themſelves; If a Biſhop have ſaid, that our Liturgy hath been ſo wiſely and charitably framed, as that the Devotion of it yeeldeth no cauſe of offence to a very Popes eare, as onely aiming at an uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſory Piety, I ſee not what hainous fault can herein be imputed to the ſpeech, or the Author: Would you think it requiſite that we ſhould chide, and quarrell when we ſpeak to the God of Peace?</p>
                     <p>It is no little advantage therefore both to our cauſe and Piety, that our Liturgie is taught to ſpeak ſeverall Languages, both for uſe and example; and thereby our Church hath gained much juſtification and honour: As for that ſharp cenſure of learned M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

we honor the name of that noble inſtrument of Gods glory in his Church, yet withall, we fear not to ſay, without any diſparagement to his worth, That our Liturgie both in the frame, and ſurvay of it, paſſed the judgement of no leſſe reverend heads then his owne: Neither would you think it could become any of our greateſt Divines, to meddle with the wafers, or Lords-day markets of his charge; let every Church take care of their own affaires.</p>
                     <p>As for that unparalleld diſcourſe of mine, concerning the Antiquity of Liturgies; <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleld,</hi> you ſay, <hi>becauſe no man, that you have ſeene, ever drew the line of Liturgie ſo high as I have done</hi>; I muſt tell you, that perhaps there may bee ſome things in the world, that may have eſcaped your not-omniſcient eies, and perhaps this may bee one; I cannot help your wonder, but I ſhall juſtifie my own Aſſertion.

That there were preſcribed, and ſtinted formes compoſed by particular men in the Church, and impoſed upon the reſt, this will not down with you; Wherein I cannot ſee, how ye will avoid your own contradiction; For I demand; Is this order of praying and adminiſtration ſet, or no? If it be not ſet, how is it an order? and if it be a ſet order both for matter and form (for you cannot, I ſuppoſe, under the name of <hi>an order,</hi> intend <hi>a meere Table, or Rabrick</hi>) how can it be other, then preſcribed? if the formes were meerly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, to what uſe was the preſcription of an Order? and, if they were not arbitrary, certainly they were in ſome ſort ſtinted and impoſed.</p>
                     <p>But what a poore exception is this? that <hi>they were compoſed by ſome particular men</hi>; Was it ever heard that a whole Church together framed a forme of prayer?

that the name of Biſhops and Presbyters were at firſt promiſcuouſly uſed; It is yeelded by you, <hi>That in proceſs of time, ſome one was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the name of Biſhop, and the reſt were called Presbyters.</hi> But what, I beſeech you, was this <hi>proceſs of time?</hi> Here lies your either error, or fraud: We doe juſtly and confidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, that this time had no proceſſe at all; it was in the <gap reason="foreign">

It is alſo yeelded, that this was not [<hi>nomen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane,</hi>] but ſeconded with ſome kind of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. What then is the difference? <hi>All the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,</hi> you ſay, <hi>is of divine right, and Apoſtolicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this imparity.</hi> Let me beſeech the Reader to conſider ſeriouſly of the ſtate of this difference, in the miſtaking whereof I have, not a little, unjuſtly ſuffered; And to remember how I have expreſſed it in my Remonſtrance, fetching the pedegree of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy from Apoſtolicall (and therefore, in that right, Divine) inſtitution: And interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my ſelf not to underſtand by [<hi>divine right</hi>] any expreſſe Law of God requiring it, upon the abſolute neceſsity of the being of a Church, but an inſtitution of Apoſtles,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49496:32"/>
inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, warranting it where it is, and requiring it where it may be had. Now whether it may be thus Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or a meerly humane and Eccleſiaſticall invention, is the queſtion in hand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>On your part,</hi> you ſay, <hi>ſtand Ierome, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe.</hi> Two ſtiffe champions indeed. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I muſt needs confeſſe, this is the onely countenance of your cauſe, which yet hath been blanked more then once. <hi>Ierome tels us,</hi> you ſay, <hi>right down in Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>Ide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt ergo Presbyter, &amp;c.</hi> Out of whoſe teſtimony you in ſumme collect, That <hi>A Presbyter and a Biſhop were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally one</hi>: That <hi>the imparity was grounded upon Eccleſiaſticall cuſtome</hi>: That <hi>before this priority, the Church was governed by the common Councell of Presbyters,</hi> and that <hi>Biſhops ought ſtill ſo to govern:</hi> And laſtly, that <hi>The occaſion of this imparity, was the diviſion, which through the Devils inſtinct fell among Chriſtians.</hi> You look now that I ſhould tell you that the Book is of uncertain credit, or that <hi>Ierome</hi> was a Presbyter, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome touch of envie to that higher dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity he miſſed; or that wiſer men then your ſelves have cenſured him in this point, for <hi>Aerianiſme</hi>: I plead none of theſe, but whiles
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49496:32"/>
you expect that I ſhould anſwer to <hi>Ierome,</hi> I ſhall ſet <hi>Ierome</hi> to anſwer for himſelfe. For the firſt, I cannot but put you in mind, that the ſame Father citing the words of the Biſhop of Jeruſalem, That there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Biſhop and a Presbyter, paſſeth a <hi>Satis imperitè</hi> upon it: but let it be ſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>At firſt,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>Biſhops and Presbyters had but one title.</hi> So ſay we too; But when began the diſtinction? Ye need not learne it of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia,</hi> he himſelfe tels you, <hi>When diviſions began:</hi> And when that? <hi>When they began to ſay, I am Pauls, I am Apollo's, I am Cephas</hi>; which was (I think) well and high in the Apoſtles time: But this you would cleanly put of, as ſpoken by <hi>Ierome</hi> in the Apoſtles phraſe, not of the time of the Apoſtle: This is but a generall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of contentions ariſen (though later) in the Church. Excuſe me Brethren, this ſhift will not ſerve your turne: Then, belike, there ſhould have been no diſtinct Biſhops till after-ages, upon this ground, that till then there were no diviſions: Or if ſo, why ſhould the remedie be ſo late after the diſeaſe? Or how comes he elſewhere to name Biſhops made by the Apoſtles, and to confeſſe that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49496:33"/>
before his time there had been many ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? Beſides, he inſtanceth in the peculiar miſ-challenging of Baptiſme, which only S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpecifieth in his owne time: And <hi>Clemens</hi> ſeconds him in his Epiſtle to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in taxing the continuance of thoſe diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; ſo as by <hi>Ieroms</hi> own confeſsion, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy was ordained early within the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times.</p>
                     <p>But then, ſay you, <hi>It was not of Apoſtolicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, but of Diabolicall occaſion:</hi> Weakly and abſurdly; As if the occaſion might not be deviliſh, and the inſtitution divine: As if the beſt Lawes did not riſe from the worſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Were not the quarrels betwixt the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Hebrews for the maintenance of their widows, an evill occurrence? yet from the occaſion thereof was raiſed the Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Deacons in the Church.</p>
                     <p>Yea but <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, <hi>This was rather by the cuſtome of the Church, then by the truth of the Lords diſpoſition.</hi> True, it was by the Cuſtome of the Church, but that Church was Apoſtolicall; not by the Lords diſpoſition immediately: for Chriſt gave no expreſſe rule for it, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately it was from Chriſt, as from his inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49496:33"/>
Apoſtles. Let <hi>Ierome</hi> himſelfe interpret himſelfe, who tels us expreſly in his Epiſtle to <hi>Euagrius,</hi> this ſuperiority of Biſhops above Presbyters, is by Apoſtolicall tradition; which is as much as we affirme. And whiles he ſaith, (<hi>toto orbe decretum eſt</hi>) that in the time of thoſe firſt diviſions, it was decreed all the world over, that Biſhops ſhould be ſet up; I would faine know, by what power (beſides Apoſtolicall) ſuch a Decree could be ſo ſoon and ſo univerſally enacted. But <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Presbyters governed the Church by their common Counſell</hi>: So they did doubtleſſe altogether, till Epiſcopacy was ſetled; who dares deny it? Yea, but he ſaith, <hi>They ought to doe ſtill</hi>: So ſay we alſo, and ſo in ſome caſes we do: Church-government is Ariſtocraticall. Neither is any Biſhop ſo abſolute, as not to be ſubject to the judgement of a Synode: Yea in many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it is determined by our Laws, that hee muſt take the adviſe and aſsiſtance of his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Presbytery.</p>
                     <p>So then, S. <hi>Ierome</hi> is in his judgement no back friend of ours, but in his Hiſtory he is our Patron. With what forehead can they perſwade their Reader, the Originall of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacie
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49496:34"/>
was not in <hi>Ieroms</hi> opinion ſo early, when they cannot but confeſſe that the ſame Father hath, in flat termes, told us, that <hi>Iames</hi> was Biſhop of Jeruſalem, <hi>Timothy</hi> of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>Titus</hi> of Crete, that ever ſince the time of <hi>Mark</hi> the Euangeliſt, (who died five or ſixe yeares before <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and almoſt forty years before S. <hi>Iohn</hi>) at Alexandria, (till the dayes of <hi>Heraclas</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius</hi>) the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have alwayes choſen one to be their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</p>
                     <p>As for thoſe poore negative arguments which follow, palpably begging the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are ſcarce worthie of a paſſe; were it not, that by them they goe about to confute their own Author, affirming, That upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of diviſions, Epiſcopacie was conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted: but he ſtands ſo cloſe to his owne grounds, as that (contrary to their miſ-allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Whitakers</hi>) he plainly tels them, Epiſcopacie is ſo proper a remedy for this evill, that unleſſe the Biſhop have a peerleſſe power, there will be as many Schiſmes as Prieſts; the wofull experience whereof we finde in the miſerable varieties of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, at this day.

you are ſo reſolved, to ſtrike that friend, whom you bring in to ſpeak for you; teach your advocate S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> how unlikely it is, that the Apoſtles ſhould give way (as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes they did) to ſuch a remedie, as might prove both ineffectuall, and dangerous; and that their holineſſe ſhould make a ſtirrup for Antichriſt.</p>

                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:49496:42"/>There is great difference of times, and in them of faſhions: In thoſe perſecuted times, when the Church was backed with no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrate, it was no boot to bid the guides of the Church to combine their Councels, and to give ſtrength to their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall actions: when a generall peace once bleſſed them, and they had the concurrence both of ſoveraigne and ſubordinate authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with them, they began ſo much to remit of this care of conjoyning their forces, as they ſuppoſed to find leſſe need of it. From hence grew a devolution of all leſſe weighty affairs to the weilding of ſingle hands. For my part, I perſwade my ſelfe, that the more frequent communicating of all the important buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Church, whether cenſures or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations, with thoſe grave aſsiſtents, which in the eye of the Law are deſigned to this purpoſe, were a thing not onely unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to the honour of our function, but very behovefull to the happy adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, ſee brethren, how you have with <hi>Simon</hi> fiſhed all night, and caught nothing. My word was, that ours were the

But herein, Brethren, you do foulely over-reach, in that you charge our Biſhops, as in a generality, with wholly-intruſting the power of ſpirituall juriſdiction to their Chancellors, and Commiſſaries: The aſsiſtance of thoſe which are learned in the Law, wee gladly uſe, neither can well want in the neceſſary occaſions of our judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature; but that wee doe either wilfully or negligently deveſt our ſelves abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that power, and wholly put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                     <p>IT is true <hi>the Remonſtrant ſoares above theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-times, even as high as the Apoſtles</hi>: As if you knew not this before; when as all this while, you have indeavoured to ſhew that the Apoſtles Biſhops, and ours are two. We do again profeſſe, that if our Biſhops chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any other power, then was delegated to, and required of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> wee ſhall yeeld them uſurpers: you kindely tell us, <hi>ſo we deſerve to be, if we doe but challenge the ſame power</hi>; and why ſo, I beſeech you bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? becauſe <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> (yee ſay) <hi>were Evangeliſts, and ſo moved in an higher ſphere</hi>; Liberally and boldly ſpoken; but where is your proofe? For <hi>Timothy,</hi> ye ſay the Text is cleare: but what Text, what the leaſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation have you for <hi>Titus?</hi> ſurely not ſo much as the leaſt ground of a conjecture; yet how confidently you avow for both: and even for <hi>Timothy</hi> your gloſſe is clear, not your text: St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids him do the worke of an Euangeliſt, what then, that rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49496:48"/>
that he was none: for he doth not ſay, do thine own worke: but the worke of an Evangeliſt: when I tell my friend, that I muſt deſire him to do the office of a Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or a Secretary for me; I do herein inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that he is neither; but ſo for the time employed; why is it not ſo here? And what I beſeech you is the worke of an Evangeliſt, but to preach the Evangell, or good tydings of peace? So, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> herein gives no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charge to his <hi>Timothy,</hi> then in 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Preach the Word, be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon:</hi> And this you ſay and urge, to be the worke of a Biſhop too; well, therefore may <hi>Timothy,</hi> notwithſtanding this charge, be no other then a Biſhop: what need theſe words to be contradiſtinguiſhed? St.<note place="margin">2· Tim 1.11.</note> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes of himſelfe, <hi>Whereto I am appoynted a Preacher, and an Apoſtle, and a teacher of the Gentiles</hi>; what ſhall we ſay St. <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apoſtle, he was not a Preacher, or not a Doctor, but an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle? You diſtinguiſh of <hi>Evangeliſts; the word is taken either for the writers of the Goſpell, or for the teachers of it,</hi> and why then was not St. <hi>Paul</hi> an Evangeliſt, who profeſſed to be a teacher of the Goſpell unto the Gentiles,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49496:49"/>
Theſe teaching Evangeliſts, you dreame to be of two ſorts; <hi>the one, thoſe that had ordinary places and gifts; the other extraordinary</hi>: but tell me ſirs, for my learning; where do you finde thoſe ordinary-placed, and ordinary-gifted Evangeliſts? unleſſe you mean to comprſe all Preachers under this name? and then a Biſhop may be an Evangeliſt alſo; ſo, as the difference of a Biſhop and an Evangeliſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth. The truth is, theſe ordinary Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts are a new fiction; their true imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to be ſent by the Apoſtles, from place to place, for the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, without a ſetled reſidence upon any one charge: upon this advantage, you raiſe a ſlight argument, <hi>that St. Paul beſought Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy to abide at Epheſus.</hi> 1. Tim. 1.3. <hi>which had been a needleſſe importunity if he had the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall charge of Epheſus; for then he muſt have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily reſided there</hi>: whereas you recite ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall proofes and occaſions of his abſence, which will appear to be of little force, if a man doe duly conſider the ſtate of thoſe times: the neceſſity wherof in that firſt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Goſpell, made even the moſt ſixed Sars planetary, calling them, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49496:49"/>
from the places of their abode, to thoſe ſervices which were of moſt uſe for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of that great worke: yet ſo, as that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after their errands fully-done, or upon all opportune intermiſſions, they returned to their own Chaire: The ſtory therefore of thoſe journal computations might well have been ſpared.</p>
                     <p>Your argument from <hi>Pauls</hi> calling the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Epheſus</hi> to <hi>Miletus,</hi> how ever you <hi>lean</hi> upon it, it will prove but a Reed.</p>
                     <p>Your ſelves confeſſe (I know not upon what certaine ground) <hi>that Timothy was at the</hi> meeting, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. with St. <hi>Paul: Had he been Biſhop there, the Apoſtle</hi> (you ſay) <hi>in ſtead of giving the Elders a charge to feede the flocke of Chriſt, would have given that charge to</hi> Timothy, <hi>and not to them: Beſides, the Apoſtle would not have ſo forgotten himſelfe, as to call the Elders Biſhops, before the Biſhops face; and would have given them ſome directions, how to carry themſelves to their Biſhops</hi>: In all which, brethren, you goe upon wrong ground; wil ye grant that theſe aſſembled perſons were Presbyters, and not Biſhops? under ſome Biſhop, though not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Timothy?</hi> otherwiſe, why doe you argue

from the want of directions to them, as infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours? but if they were indeed Biſhops, and not mere Preſbyters, (as the word it ſelfe imports) your argument is loſt:<note place="margin">

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49496:50"/>
from his <hi>Episcopacy</hi> at <hi>Epheſus</hi>; but to cut the ſinewes of all this ſtrong proofe of your computation; it is more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that, whereas the whole hiſtory of the <hi>Acts</hi> ends with <hi>Pauls</hi> firſt beeing at <hi>Rome,</hi> that Apoſtle ſurvived divers years, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many travells, and did many great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for the plantation, and ſetling of chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whereof we can looke for no account from Scripture, ſave by ſome glances in his following Epiſtles; into which time theſe occurrents concerning <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> his ordination did fall, as may be juſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the Chronologicall table of the experienced <hi>Jacob Cappellus,</hi> compared with <hi>Baronius</hi>: Now then, the Reader may take his choyſe, whether he will believe all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, (that have medled with this ſubject) affirming <hi>Timothy</hi> to have been biſhop of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> or whether he wil believe a new hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched contradiction of yeſterday, raiſed out of imaginary probabilities: Shortly, it is far enough from appearing, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was no <hi>Biſhop,</hi> but a Miniſter, an Evangeliſt a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-labourer of the Apoſtles, an Apoſtle, a Meſſenger of the Church; it rather appeares that he was al theſe in divers ſences, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

laid in our diſh: Learned Doctor <hi>Fulk</hi> hath well cleared our intentions herein from their cenſure: <hi>Tindall</hi> himſelfe profeſſes to doe it out of this reaſon, becauſe the Popiſh Clergy had appropriated to themſelves the name of the Church; but however, they rather made uſe of the Word; yet not ſo as that hereby they intend onely to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Pariſhionall meetings. So <hi>Epheſians</hi> 3. To the intent that now to the Rulers and Powers in heavenly places, might bee knowne by the Congregation, the manifold Wiſedome of GOD; Doe wee thinke this bleſſed Revelation confined to a Pariſh, or common to the whole Church of God? So 1. <hi>Corinthians</hi> 15. they turne, <hi>I am not worthy to bee called an Apoſtle, becauſe I perſecuted the Congregation of GOD</hi>: Doe we thinke his cruelty was confined to a Pariſh? So <hi>Matthew</hi> 6.16. <hi>Vpon this Rocke will I build my Congregation</hi>: was this a Pariſh onely? So <hi>Acts</hi> 11. <hi>Herod the King ſtretched out his hands to vexe certaine of the Congregation</hi>: Was his malice onely Parochiall? but ſecondly, ye tell us, that in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which was one of thoſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49496:58"/>
Candleſticks, there was but one flock. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. Yea, but can you tell us what kind of Flock it was, whether Nationall, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall, or Dioceſan? Parochiall (I am ſure) it could not be: you have heard before, that thoſe Elders or Biſhops were ſent for from <hi>Epheſus</hi>: But that they were all of <hi>Epheſus</hi> it cannot be proved; when all of them then are bidden to take heede to the Flocke of Chriſt, whereof they are made over-ſeers, each is herein charged to look to his owne; and all are in the next words required to feed the Church of GOD, which he hath purchaſed with his owne blood. So as your ſecond argument is fully anſwered in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the firſt, and in the former paſſages of this Section. The advantage that you take from <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> affirming that divers Cities of that time might have two Biſhops, whereas Alexandria held cloſe to one, can availe you little, when it ſhall bee well weighed; firſt, that your Tenet ſuppoſeth and requireth that every Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter ſhould bee a Biſhop, and therefore (if your cauſe ſpeed) there ſhould be no few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49496:58"/>
Biſhops than pariſhes. Secondly, that the practiſe of the whole Church, both before and after <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> is by ſuch cleare teſtimonies convinced to be contrary: fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and irrefragable, is that Canon of <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>MY ſatisfaction to objections comes next to be ſcanned; Objections, which would to God they were onely of my own framing.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt, That Epiſcopacy is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of Soveraigntie, I juſtly prove, for that there is a compatibleneſſe in this caſe of Gods act, and the Kings. It is God that makes the Biſhop, the King that gives the Biſhoprick: what can you ſay to this?</p>
                     <p>You tell us you have already proved that God never made a biſhop, as hee ſtands in <hi>ſuperiority over Presbyters,</hi> ſo you told us; and that is enough, we were hard hearted if wee would not believe you: When as wee have made good by undeniable proofes, that (beſides the grounds which our Saviour laid of this imparity) the bleſſed Apoſtles by inſpiration from God, made this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in a perſonall ordaining of ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt, and giving expreſſe charge of Ordination and Iuriſdiction to thoſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49496:65"/>
ſelect perſons, in Church government, the Biſhops have ever ſince ſucceeded.</p>
                     <p>Tell us not therefore, <hi>that if wee diſclaim the influence of Soveraignty into our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and aſſert that the King doth not make us Biſhops, wee muſt have no beeing at all</hi>; For, that the Reader may ſee you ſtop your owne mouth; anſwer me, I beſeech you, Where, or when ever did the King create a Biſhop? name the man, and take the cauſe. It pleaſes his Majeſtie to give his <hi>Congedelier</hi> for a Biſhops Election to his See, to ſignifie his Royall aſſent thereunto; upon which the Biſhop is ſolemnly ordained by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the hands of the Metropolitan, and other his Brethren; and theſe doe, as from God, inveſt him in his holy Calling, which he exerciſes in that place, which is deſigned and given by his Majeſtie: What can be more plaine then this truth? As for that unworthy cenſure which you paſſe upon the juſt compariſon of Kings in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Biſhops, and Patrons in order to their Clerks, it ſhall be acknowledged, well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, if you ſhall be able to make good the diſparity; <hi>When hee ſhall prove</hi> (you ſay)
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49496:65"/>
                        <hi>that the Patron gives Miniſteriall power to his Clerke, as the King gives Epiſcopall power to the Biſhop, it may bee of ſome conducement to his cauſe</hi>: Shortly, brethren, the ſame day that you ſhall ſhew mee that the King ordained a biſhop, the ſame day will I ſhew you that a Patron ordained a Presbyter: The Patron gives the benefice to the one, The King gives the biſhopricke to the other: neither of them do give the Office, or Calling to either. Goe you therefore with your Frier <hi>Simon,</hi> to your Cell, and conſult with your Covent for more reaſon and wit, then you ſhew in this, and the next ſcornfull <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph</hi>; wherein whiles you flout at my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt conceſſion with an unbeſeeming frump, you are content ſilently to balke that my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond anſwer, which you know was too hot, or too heavie for your ſatiſfaction.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond; the Imputation pretended to bee caſt by this Tenet upon al the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, which want this governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I indevoured ſo to ſatisfie, that I might juſtly decline the envy, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be thereby raiſed againſt us: For which cauſe, I profeſſed that wee doe love
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49496:66"/>
and honour thoſe our ſiſter Churches, as the dear ſpouſe of Chriſt, and give zealous teſtimonies of my well wiſhing to them.</p>
                     <p>Your uncharitableneſſe offers to choake me with thoſe ſcandalous cenſures, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull terms which ſome of ours have let fall upon thoſe Churches, and their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent profeſſors, which I confeſſe, it is more eaſie to be ſorry for, then (on ſome hands) to excuſe; The errour of a few may not bee imputed to all.</p>
                     <p>My juſt defence is that no ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent can be drawne from our opinion; for as much as the Divine or Apoſtolicall right, which wee hold, goes not ſo high, as if there were an expreſſe command, that upon an abſolute neceſſity there muſt bee either Epiſcopacy, or no Church; but ſo far only, that it both may and ought to be; How fain would you heere finde mee in a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Whiles I one-where reckon Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy amongſt matters eſſential to the Church, another where, deny it to be of the eſſence thereof; Wherein you willingly hide your eys that you may not ſee the diſtinction that I make expreſly betwixt the Being &amp; Well-beeing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49496:66"/>
of a Church: Affirming that thoſe Churches, to whom this power and faculty is denied, loſe nothing of the true eſſence of a Church, though they miſſe ſomething of their glory, and perfection.</p>
                     <p>No, Brethren, it is enough for ſome of your friends to hold their Diſcipline altogether eſſentiall to the very being of a Church; We dare not be ſo zealous.</p>
                     <p>The queſtion which you aske concerning the reaſon of the different intertainment, given in our Church to prieſts converted to us from <hi>Rome,</hi> and to Miniſters, who in Qu. <hi>Maries</hi> dayes had received Impoſition of hands in Reformed Churches abroad, is meerely perſonall; neither can challenge my deciſion; Onely I give you theſe two anſwers; that what fault ſoever may bee in the eaſie admittance of thoſe, who have received <hi>Romiſh</hi> Orders, the ſticking at the admiſſion of our brethren returning from Reformed Churches, was not in caſe of Ordination; but of Inſtitution: they had beene acknowledged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt, without any other hands layed upon them, but according to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49496:67"/>
the Lawes of our Land they were not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, capable of inſtitution to a benefice, unleſſe they were ſo qualified, as the Statutes of this Realme doe require; And ſecondly I know thoſe, more then one, that by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue onely of that Ordination, which they have brought with them from other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, have enjoyed Spirituall Promotions and Livings without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt the lawfulneſſe of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                     <p>The confident affirmation which you alleage of the learned biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> is no rule to us;<note place="margin">B. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</note> I leave him to his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; You think I have too much work on my hand to give ſatisfaction for myſelfe in theſe two main Queſtions which ariſe from my book.</p>
                     <p>What high points ſhall wee now expect trow wee?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt, whether that Office, which by divine right hath ſole power of Ordination, and ruling all other Officers of the Church</hi> (which hee ſayth Epiſcopacy hath) <hi>belong not to the being, but onely to the glorie, and perfection of a Church</hi>: Can wee tell what theſe men would have?
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49496:67"/>
Have they a minde to goe beyond us in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting that neceſſity, and eſſentiall uſe of Epiſcopacy, which we dare not avow? Do they not care to loſe their cauſe, ſo <hi>they may croſse</hi> an Adverſary? For <hi>your</hi> Queſtion, <hi>you</hi> ſtil talke of ſole Ordination, and ſole juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; <hi>you</hi> may (<hi>if you pleaſe</hi>) keepe that paire of ſoles for <hi>your</hi> next ſhooes: VVee contend not for ſuch an height of <hi>Propriety,</hi> neither do we practiſe it; they are ſo ours, that they ſhould not bee without us, as we have <hi>formerly ſhewed</hi>; That therefore there ſhould bee a power of lawfull Ordination and government in every ſetled Church, it is no leſſe then neceſſary, but that in what caſe ſoever of extremity, and irreſiſtible ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, this ſhould be only done by Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall hands, we never meant to affirme: It is enough that <hi>regularly</hi> it ſhould be their Act.</p>
                     <p>Your ſecond Queſtion is, <hi>There being</hi> (in this mans thoughts) <hi>the ſame</hi> jus Divinum <hi>for Biſhops, that there is for Paſtors and Elders, whether, if thoſe Reformed Churches, wanted Paſtors and Elders too, they ſhould want nothing of the eſſence of a Church; but of the Perfection, and Glory of it</hi>: The anſwere is ready: If
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49496:68"/>
thoſe Reformed Churches, wanting thoſe whom you call paſtors and Elders, did yet injoy the government, by Biſhops, Prieſts &amp; Deacons, they ſhould be ſo far from wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ought of the eſſence of a Church, that they ſhould herein attain to much glory and perfection: And ſo much for your deepe queſtions.</p>
                     <p>The preſumptuous Remonſtrant would ſeeme to know ſo much of the minde of thoſe Churches, that hee ſaith, <hi>if they might have their option, he doubts not but they would gladly embrace Epiſcopall government</hi>; a foule imputation which your Zeale muſt needes wipe off; for which purpoſe you bring the confeſſions of the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, averring the truth, and juſtifiableneſſe of their owne government; For which they have good reaſon: neither ſhall you herein expect my contradiction; nor yet my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent labour of reconciling their governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ours in the maine and materiall points of both, This condition they are in, and they doe well to defend it, but they did not tell you they would not (if oportunity were offered) be content with a better; I am
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49496:68"/>
deceived if their own publicke Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be not ſtill concluded with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a Change; and I have elſewhere ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Fregevillaeus,</hi> that this Order of Government was in their Churches at firſt only proviſionall; and inſtanced in thoſe teſtimonies of approbation, which their learned Divines have freely given to our forme of Adminiſtration; which I ſhal not now ſtand either to repeate, or multiply: Let it be enough for the preſent to ſay, that upon my certain knowledg, many eminent Divines of the Churches abroad have ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly wiſhed themſelves in our condition, and have applauded and magnified our Church, as the moſt Famous, Exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and glorious Church in the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World: So as I wanted not good reaſon, for that which you are pleaſed to ſtile preſumptuous aſſertion.</p>
                     <p>But the reaſon of my Aſſertion is yet ſo more offenſive, that you Wonder how it could fall from my Pen:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That there is little difference in the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of other Proteſtant Churches and our owne, ſave in the perpetuity of their Moderator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,

and the excluſion of Lay Elders; A paſſage, belike,</hi> as you ſay, <hi>of admirable abſurdity.</hi> But ſoft, brethren, I am afraid, firſt, leaſt you ſpeake of what you know not; I ſpeak not onely of the next Churches of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and the <hi>Netherland,</hi> I ſpeake of them in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, as one that (if this place would bear it) could give a particular account of them all: Neither can your cavills worke my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. You tell me of the Moderatour in <hi>Geneva</hi> (as if all the Church of God were included in thoſe ſtrait walls) I could tell you of the ſuperintendents of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Germany,</hi> of the <hi>Prepoſiti</hi> in the Churches of <hi>Weteraw, Heſſia, Anhalt,</hi> of the <hi>Seniores,</hi> in <hi>Tranſylvania, Polonia, Bohemia</hi>; But what of the Moderator in <hi>Geneva?

                  <argument>
                     <p>Whether Epiſcopacie be of <hi>Divine right</hi>? That is, whether the Apoſtles ordained this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, that not onely one ſhould be placed over the people, but over <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> who ſhould have the power of Impoſition of Hands, or Ordination, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Eccleſiaſticall Counſels.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His was anciently denyed by <hi>Aerius,</hi> as is related by <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> in his 75 Hereſie, and by <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> as appears by <hi>Hierome,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Pammachius.</hi> And there are not wanting in theſe dayes many learned and pious men, who, although they acknowledge <hi>Aerius</hi> to have

erred, in that he ſhould diſallow of that manner of Eccleſiaſticall government, which had beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the whol World; yet in this they agree with him, that Epiſcopall government is not of Divine Right. From whoſe opinion why I ſhould ſever my judgement, I am moved by theſe ſtrong reaſons, famous examples, and evident authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>My judgement is this;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Epiſtles the name of <hi>Biſhop</hi> did never ſignifie any thing different from the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a <hi>Presbyter.</hi> For a <hi>Biſhop, Presbyter,</hi> and an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,</hi> were common names, as you may ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 20. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Pet. v.</hi> 12. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Next.</hi> In the chiefe Apoſtolicall Church, the Church was governed by the common advice of <hi>Presbyters</hi>; and that for ſome yeers in the time of the preaching of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> For firſt of all, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies muſt bee gathered together, before we can define any thing concerning their perpetuall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as long as they were preſent or neere their Churches, did not place any <hi>Biſhop</hi> over them, properly ſo called, but only <hi>Presbyters,</hi> reſerving Epiſcopall authority to themſelves alone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> after the <hi>Goſpell</hi> was farre and neere propagated, and that out of equality of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> by the inſtinct of the Devill, <hi>Schiſmes</hi> were made in Religion, then the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> (eſpecially in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49496:88"/>
the more remote places) placed ſome over the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, or Presbyters, which ſhortly after, by the Diſciples of the Apoſtles, <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and others, were onely called biſhops, &amp; by this appellation, they were diſtinguiſhed from Presbyters &amp; Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.</p>
                  <p>Reaſons moving me to this opinion? Firſt, <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> upon the 1. Chapter of the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> writeth, <hi>that a Presbyter is the ſame with a Biſhop, and before that, by the inſtinct of the Devill, factions were made in Religion, and it was ſaid among the people, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>I of</hi> Apollo, <hi>but I of</hi> Cephas, <hi>the Churches were governed by the common counſell of Presbyters: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it was decreed in the whol world, that one cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of the Presbyters, ſhould be placed over the reſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From whence I thus argue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When it began to be ſaid among the people, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>I of</hi> Apollo, <hi>but I of</hi> Cephas, <hi>then one choſen out of the Presbyters,</hi> was placed over the reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But whiles the Apoſtles lived, it was ſo ſaid among the people.</hi> As the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians, beſides other of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, puts it out of doubt. <hi>Therefore, while the Apoſtles lived, one choſen out of the Presbyters was placed over the reſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Againe,</hi> There can be no other terme aſſigned, in which Biſhops were firſt made, then the time of the Apoſtles; for all the prime ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles were Biſhops: witneſſe the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Biſhops in the moſt famous Churches of <hi>Hieruſalem, Alexandria, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> as it is in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> therefore, either the next ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49496:89"/>
of the Apoſtles, changed the force of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall government, received from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, according to their owne pleaſure, which is very unlikely, or the Epiſcopall government came from the Apoſtles themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, even then in the time of the Apoſtles, there were many Presbyters, but one Biſhop, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then in the time of the Apoſtles, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, hee that was placed over the reſt, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was called Biſhop, did impoſe hands, or ordaine Miniſters of the Word, which Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alone did not preſume to doe. Even then, therefore, the calling of Biſhops was diſtinct from the Office of Presbyters.</p>
                  <p>If any deſire the examples of Apoſtolicall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, the books of the antient are full of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal authority, of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> either of which, howſoever, firſt performed the office of an Evangeliſt, yet notwithſtanding, ceaſed to be an Evangeliſt, after that <hi>Timothy</hi> was placed over the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> over the Church of <hi>Crete</hi>; For Evangeliſts did only lay the foundations of faith in forraign places, &amp; then did commend the reſt of the care to certaine Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, but they themſelves went to other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and Nations, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> writes in his third Booke of Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory, and 34. Chap. But <hi>Paul</hi> taught ſometimes in <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete</hi> and laid the foundations of Faith there; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he commandeth <hi>Timothy</hi> to ſtay at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus</hi> at <hi>Crete,</hi> not as Evangeliſts but as governors of the Churches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:49496:89"/>And indeed, the Epiſtles, written to either of them, doe evince the ſame; for in theſe, he doth not preſcribe the manner of gathering together a Church, which was the duty of an Evangeliſt, but the manner of governing a Church, being already gathered together, which is the duty of a Biſhop; and all the precepts in thoſe Epiſtles, are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable hereunto, as that they are not refer'd in eſpeciall to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> but in general to all Biſhops, and therefore in no wiſe, they ſuit with the temporary power of Evangeliſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beſides,</hi> that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> had Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall juriſdiction, not onely <hi>Euſebius, Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, Theodoret, Ambroſius, Hierome, Epiphanius, Oecumenius, Primaſius, Theophylact,</hi> but alſo the moſt ancient writers, of any that write the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the new Teſtament, whoſe writings are now loſt, do ſufficiently declare: <hi>Euſebius</hi> without doubt appealing unto thoſe, in his third book of Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory and 4. chapter, <hi>Timothy</hi> (ſaith hee) in Hiſtories is written to bee the firſt which was made Biſhop of the Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> as <hi>Titus</hi> was the firſt, that was made Biſhop of the Church of <hi>Crete.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, and not any antient Diſciple of the Apoſtles, bee the authour of the Revelation, hee ſuggeſts unto us, thoſe ſeven new Examples of Apoſtolicall Biſhops: For all the moſt learned Interpreters interpret the ſeven Angels of the Churches, to be the ſeven Biſhops of the Churches; neither can they doe otherwiſe,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49496:90"/>
unleſſe they ſhould offer violence to the text.</p>
                  <p>What ſhould I ſpeake of <hi>James,</hi> not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles but the Brother of our Saviour, the Sonne in law of the Mother of our Lord: who by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, was ordained Biſhop of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi> in his 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. book of Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory, &amp; 1 chap. out of the 6. of the <hi>Hypotypoſes</hi> of <hi>Clement, Hierome</hi> concerning Eccleſiaſticall writers, out of the 1. of the Comments of <hi>Egeſippus,</hi> relate, <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> upon the 1. chap. unto the <hi>Galatians, Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> in his 23 Homily upon the 15 of the <hi>Acts, Auguſtine</hi> in his 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. book and 37 chap. againſt <hi>Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conius, Epiphanius</hi> in his 65, Hereſie, The 6. Synod in <hi>Tullo,</hi> and 32 Canon, all aſſenting thereunto. For indeed, this is that <hi>James</hi> that had his firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as an ordinary Biſhop, whom <hi>Paul</hi> in his firſt, and laſt coming to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> found in the City; almoſt all the Apoſtles prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in other places, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.19. and that conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thoſe things, which were decreed in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. For hee was with <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> Biſhop of the Church of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> from whom when certaine came, <hi>Peter</hi> would not eate with the Gentiles. <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.12.</p>
                  <p>From examples, I paſſe to authorities, which <hi>Ignatius</hi> confirmes by his own authority,</p>
                  <p>Whoſe axiomes are theſe.
<q>The Biſhop is he, which is ſuperiour in all chiefty, and power. The Presbytery, is a holy company of counſellours, and aſſeſſours to the Biſhop. The deacons are the imitators of angelicall vertues, which ſhew forth their pure, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable miniſtry. He which doth not obey theſe, is without
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49496:90"/>
God, impure, and contemnes Christ, and derogates from his order, and conſtitution,</q> 
in his Epiſtle to the<hi> Trallians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In an other place,
<q>I exhort that ye ſtudy to doe all things with concord. The Biſhop being preſident in the place of God. The Presbyters in place of the Apoſtolick Senate, the Deacons as thoſe to whom was committed the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of Jeſus Chriſt, </q>
in his Epiſtle to the<hi> Magneſians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And againe, <q>Let the Presbyters be ſubject to the Biſhop, the Deacons to the Presbyters, the people to the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Deacons, </q>
in his Epiſtle to thoſe of<hi> Tarſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Ignatius</hi> was the Diſciple of the Apoſtles, from whence then had he this Hierarchie but from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles?</p>
                  <p>Let us now heare <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in his 75. Hereſie. <q>The Apoſtles could not preſently appoint all things: Preſbyters and Deacons were neceſſary; for by theſe two, Eccleſiaſticall affaires might bee dispatch. Where there was not found any f<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t for the Epiſeopacie, that place remained without a Biſhop, but where there was need, and there were any fit for Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, they were made Biſhops. All things were not compleat from the beginning, but in tract of time all things were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided which were required for the perfection of thoſe things which were neceſſary, the Church by this means receiving the fulneſſe of dispenſation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Euſebius</hi> comes neerer to the matter, &amp; more ſtrongly handles the cauſe, who in his third booke of Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory, and 22: chapter, as alſo in his Chronicle affirmeth <hi>that</hi> Erodius <hi>was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the</hi> 1. <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Antioch in the yeere of our Lord. 45. in the 3. yeere of <hi>Claudius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror:
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49496:91"/>
at which time, many of the Apoſtles were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. Now <hi>Hierome</hi> writeth to <hi>Evagrius, that at</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria, <hi>from</hi> Mark <hi>the Evangeliſt, unto</hi> Heraclius <hi>and</hi> Dioniſius <hi>the Biſhop, the Presbyters called one, choſen out of themſelvs, and placed in a higher degree, the Biſhop.</hi> But <hi>Marke</hi> dyed, as <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholcerus</hi> teſtifie, in the yeere of our Lord 64. <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> the Apoſtles, being then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live: therefore, it is cleere, that Epiſcopacie was inſtituted in the time of the Apoſtles, and good <hi>Hierome</hi> ſuffered ſome frailty, when he wrote, that <hi>Biſhops were greater then Presbyters, rather by the cuſtome of the Church, then the truth of the Lords diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing</hi>; unleſſe perhaps, by the cuſtome of the Church, hee underſtands the cuſtome of the Apoſtles, and by the truth of the Lords diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, hee underſtands the apointment of Chriſt, yet not ſo, hee ſatiſfies the truth of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. For it appears out of the 1.2. and 3. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that the forme of governing the Church by Angels or Biſhops, was not only ratified, and eſtabliſhed, in the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by the very Son of God. And <hi>Ignatius</hi> called that form the order of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And when <hi>Hierome</hi> writes, <hi>that it was decreed in the whole World, that one choſen out of the Presbyters ſhould bee placed over the reſt.</hi> And when I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, that in the life-time of the Apoſtles, Biſhops were ſuperior to Presbyters in Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and that each Church had one placed over it, doe wee not without cauſe demand; where, when,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49496:91"/>
and by whom Epiſcopacie was ordained? Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie therefore is of divine right. Which, how the Prelates of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for almoſt 300. yeers, did adorne with the truth of Doctrine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of life, conſtancy in afflictions, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Death it ſelfe for the honour of Chriſt; and on the other ſide, how in ſucceding times, firſt by their ambition, next by their exceſſive pragmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call covetouſneſſe, ſcraping up to themſelves the goods of this world, then by their hereſie, laſt of all by their tyranny they corrupted it, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Hierarchy,</hi> at this day, hath nothing elſe left but a vizard of the <hi>Apoſtolicall Eccleſiaſticall Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,</hi> and the lively image of the whore of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> our Hiſtories both antient and moderne doe abundantly teſtifie.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore all Biſhops are warned from hence, that they throughly weigh with themſelves the nature of Apoſtolicall Epiſcopacie, of which they glory that they are the ſucceſſors.</p>
                  <p>That Epiſcopacie had two things peculiar to it, the privilege of ſucceeding, &amp; the prerogative of ordaining: all other things were common to them with the Presbyters. Therefore both Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Presbyters, ſhould ſo exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in godlineſſe, ſhould ſo free themſelves from contempt by their converſation, and ſo make themſelves examples to their flock; not neglecting eſpecially the gift of prophecying, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from above, but being wholly intent, to reading, conſolation, and teaching: to meditate

on theſe things, to be wholly converſant in them; and ſo perpetually imployed in this holy functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and divine affairs, with this promiſe, that if they ſhall doe theſe things, they ſhall both ſave themſelves, and their Auditors, but if after the cuſtome of ſome great ones, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the pride and luxury of this World, they ſhall both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy themſelves, and them that heare them.(*)</p>

They ſent their collection to the Elders by the hands of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> that is to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.13. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> They ordained them Elders in every Church: And <hi>Acts</hi> 15.2. A main queſtion of faith is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Apoſtles and Elders of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>; but what? to be decided by Lay-Men? for the Elders met with the Apoſtles to conſider of this matter, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.6.</p>
                  <p>And the Presbyters are joyned together with the Apoſtles <hi>Verſe</hi> 22. and are diſtinguiſhed from the whole Church, as alſo <hi>v.</hi> 23. and <hi>chap.</hi> 16.4. Again in the 20. of the <hi>Acts</hi> the Elders of <hi>Epheſus verſe</hi> 17. are ſaid to be made Biſhops to feede the flocke of <hi>Chriſt, ver.</hi> 18. and in <hi>Acts</hi> 21.18. and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes following, the Presbyters or Elders of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> inſtruct the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> what he is to doe; and therefore were no Lay-men. In this very Chapter, when <hi>Timothy</hi> is commanded to receive no accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt an Elder, the Elder there is a teacher, as ſhall be ſhewed in the next chapter. <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5. that thou maiſt ordain Elders in every City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what kind of Elders? ſurely, teachers; for hee adds, if

                  <p>And <hi>James</hi> 5.14. The ſick are bidden to ſend for the Elders of the Church, that they may pray over, and anoint the ſick with oyle in the name of the Lord, which is no Lay-mans duty: 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5.1. The Elders I exhort who am alſo a fellow-Elder, feede the flock; How is hee a fellow-Elder, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a teacher as they?</p>
                  <p>And they are charged to feed the flook, therefore Paſtors, 2, <hi>Ioh·</hi> 1. &amp; 3 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all queſtion is called an Elder. <hi>Ignatius</hi> makes often mention of Elders, or Presbyters in his Epiſtles, but never of Lay-Elders. And in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to thoſe of <hi>Tarſus</hi> deſcribing the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Hierarchy of his time, he ſaith (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) Let the Presbyters bee ſubject to the Biſhops, and the Deacons to the Presbyters, and the Lay-men to both Deacons, and Presbyters: and to the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſians</hi> As the Lord ſaith hee doth nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Father: ſo neither do you without your Biſhop, neither Presbyter, nor deacon, nor Laick. Where obſerve that the very Deacons did not ſit in the Presbytery Apoſtoli<expan>

                     </expan>, much leſſe Lay-men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the defence of Lay-Elders out of the 17. <hi>verſe</hi> of <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. of the 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> is againſt the Perpetuall doctrine of St. <hi>Paul</hi>: for to give honour to the Presbyters, or Elders, is to honour them with maintenance, out of the publique ſtock of the Church; for ſo the Apoſtle, before, commands theſe that are indeed Widowes to be honoured,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49496:94"/>
that is to be deſigned to publique attendances and allowances; And the reaſon which the Apoſtle gives, confirmes this explication of the honour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; When he ſaith thou ſhalt not muzzle the Oxe that treadeth out the corne. And in <hi>Matthew</hi> the honor of Parents is chiefely to be taken of meat and maintenance, which ſignification is very fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and proper to the word (<hi>Kabud</hi>) uſed in the fifth commandement, and ſo the word is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Marke</hi> 7.12. But maintenance, out of the ſtock of the Church, the Apoſtle would not have to be given even to ſuch poore widdows, as could be otherwiſe provided for; as before <hi>verſe</hi> 16. And he himſelfe laboured with his owne hands, that he might not bee burdenſome to others, much leſſe would he have the chiefe of the Laity who abound with wealth to bee maintained of the common ſtore; and that more liberally then others: For, if by thoſe that rule well, you ſhall underſtand both Lay-Elders and ſacred alſo, you muſt needs conclude, that they are all worthy of double honour, both thoſe which rule, and thoſe which labour in Doctrine: which concluſion the Apoſtle is againſt elſewhere; whileſt hee ſaith, thoſe which ſerve at the Altar, muſt partake of the Altar. And the Lord himſelfe who hath appointed that thoſe which preach the Goſpell ſhould live of the Goſpell, 1. <hi>Corinthians</hi> 9.13.14. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Hierome</hi> in the ſame place; hee would ſaith hee, have them to yeeld carnall things to thoſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49496:95"/>
of whom they receive ſpiritual things, becauſe they being taken up in teaching, cannot provide neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things for themſelves. Yea, I ſay yet more, if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had, by thoſe that rule, underſtood Lay-elders, certainly hee would ſome-where have put them in minde of their duty, or, at leaſt have made mention of them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. where he doth not omit to give charge even of Deacons, and Deaconeſſes: But he doth neither of the two, but preſently after the mention of Biſhops, or Presbyters that were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, he falls into the ſpeech concerning Deacons, and their wives; ſo as it is a plaine proofe that Lay-Elders were utterly unknown to him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the defence of Lay-Elders out of this place is utterly againſt the judgment of the fathers, ſo many as ever have expounded this text of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle: Neither indeed is there any neceſſity at all, that becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, thoſe eſpecially that labour in Word and Doctrine, therefore we ſhould deviſe new Elders to bee taken out of the common people: For it was well knowne, that thoſe of the Clergie, which are over the Lords flock, have their diſtinct Offices, and employments. There are of them, which adminiſter Sacraments, make publike prayers, privately admoniſh faithfull people, and with-hold them from ſinning; there are others, which being indued with excellent guifts of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, imploy themſelves in being teachers &amp; guids to mens ſoules in the way to heaven, and the labors of theſe men, which are taken by them, in word and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49496:95"/>
Doctrine, are juſtly preferred before the ſervice of them, which adminiſter the ſacraments, and make prayers for the Church; even by the teſtimony of the Apoſtle himſelfe, who ſaith; <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to baptize, but to preach the Goſpell,</hi> 1. Cor. 1.17. <hi>He was ſent for both purpoſes,</hi> but the chief end of his miſſion, was, the preaching of the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Whoſoever therefore, thus rule the people, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they doe adminiſter the Sacrament, or onely preach the word, or whether they doe both, are worthy of double Honour; where a certain number is put for an uncertain, double honour, that is greater and more then others; although ſome are of opinion, that here by Apoſtoli<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity there is a greater portion aſſigned to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, then to others that appertain to the Church, others interpret it of that double Honour which is fit for governours to have; one, of an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reverence and command, the other of more largeneſſe of maintenarce; that they be, both, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and reſpected above others, and, that they have a more liberall proviſion of neceſſaries for their livelyhood; but the firſt of them is the more ſimple expoſition of the words. He therefore holds thoſe, that are ſet over the people worthy of double honour; And why double? A little before he had given them order about the honoring, that is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of their Widowes, at the charge of the Church: from the Widows, hee paſſeth to the Elders, or Presbyters; whom, if they rule well, hee would have honoured with a double alowance,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49496:96"/>
that is greater then that of the Widowes, both by reaſon of their office, and by reaſon of their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and amongſt thoſe that rule, yet againe, hee would have thoſe moſt regarded, who are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed not ſo much in adminiſtring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, as in preaching the Word. I doubt not but this is the moſt true Explication of this place</p>
