            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Just Account of the Horrid Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of <hi>John Cupper,</hi> and <hi>Judith Brown</hi> his Servant, in Poysoning his Wife.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>JOHN C<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PPER</hi> was born at <hi>Snitton,</hi> in the Parish of <hi>Bitterley,</hi> and a short time educated at the School of <hi>Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>; not making any proficiency in Learning, his Father <hi>Thomas Cupper,</hi> removed him from thence to <hi>Ludlow,</hi> to a Writing-School: Where after he had spent some time, his Father put him out to several Services; but not behaving himself well in some of them, he returned to his Fathers house; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Marryed <hi>Hannah</hi> the Daughter of <hi>John Wheeler,</hi> Rector of <hi>Wafers Hopton,</hi> about Three Miles distant from <hi>Bitterley,</hi> against the consent of her Father and all her Relations. Not long after they were Married, though her Fortune was beyond his Merit: continual Jars and Quarrels happened betwixt them, in so much that their Neighbours were in daily fear, lest some mischief should attend their ungodly way of Living.</p>
            <p>At last, he with his Servant <hi>Judith Brown,</hi> a Notorious Strumpet, contriv'd the Death of this Miserable and Unfortunate Woman. They both long debated, how they should accomplish their wicked design, and after several Consults, they concluded the securest way to effect it, was by Poyson.</p>
            <p>This they attempted for the space of a Month together: and what they thus basely and wickedly design'd, at last they brought to pass.</p>
            <p>Her Death being sudden, her Neighbours came and told me that they were afraid, that <hi>John Cupper</hi> had made away with his Wife: I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29885:4"/>
told them, That if they did suspect it, (as indeed there was just cause, by the words they had given out) that they ought to go to the next Justice of Peace, for his Warrant to apprehend both <hi>Cupper</hi> and his Servant <hi>Brown</hi>; and after Apprehension, to send for the Coroner; who summoned a Jury at <hi>Bitterley</hi> upon <hi>Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> day, and caus'd the Body of the Murthered Person to be taken up again, being buried the Lord's Day before. After the Body was viewed, and <hi>Cupper</hi> and his Servant brought to touch the Corps, the Coroner causeth them to be separated, and examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them asunder very strictly; and I must needs say, with much Prudence and Caution.</p>
            <p>But they had so combin'd together, that for some hours they stifly denied the Guilt charged against them, and their Tales were but little differing one from the other.</p>
            <p>At last his Servant being removed, whilst <hi>Cupper</hi> was under a second or third Examination; A Farmer of the Parish, with the Maids Sister, goes to her, and told her if she would confess truly, she might be in some hopes of being sav'd; if not, they were both like to suffer together; the Witnesses that were examined, having Sworn so materially against them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judith Brown</hi> listening to this, confess'd presently that her Master and she had poyson'd her Mistress; the Farmer and some others acquainted the Coroner privately with it; upon that he was removed, and she brought under Examination again, and confessed the Fact before the Jury, and several other By-standers, and set her hand to the Confession. She being again removed, <hi>Cupper</hi> was called in, and when he perceived that his Servant had declared it, he likewise confessed it, and set his Hand to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. Upon this they were both the same Night sent towards <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> Gaol, and the next day were secured there.</p>
            <p>During the time of their Imprisonment, I went with two of his Neighbours to visit him, where we found him seemingly not much concern'd; and after some little time of Discourse with him, and lamenting the miserable state and condition, that he had brought himself into, I desired the Jaylor and my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to withdraw; and discourst him an hour at least by my self. He then utterly denied what he had set his Hand unto before, and pleaded, with Tears in his Eyes, his own Innocency; and did not doubt, but at his Tryal he should clear himself, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29885:4"/>
that he was there in Chains by the malice of his next Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. I told him that whatever he did propose to himself, he would certainly die for this offence, and that poysoning of his Wife was so horrid and dismal a Crime, that he could have no hopes of Pardon; and therefore perswaded him what I could to betake himself to his Prayers and Tears day and night, to secure, if possible, the Salvation of his Soul. When I had said what I could to him, I desired the Jaylor that his Servant might have the Liberty to come to me; he granted it presently, and when she came, she pleaded her own Innocency likewise, and though she had put her hand to her Confession before, yet vow'd she was not Guilty: But I assur'd her, as a little before I had her Master, that they would both die for that black and fearful Crime; and desired and intreated them both, that they would prepare for their latter End; that their times were but short in this World; and that in a wretched and shameful manner they would be cut off: And then I took my leave of them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending them to the mercy of Almighty God, with my earnest Prayers and Supplications for them.</p>
            <p>After I had left them both in tears, they having the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency it seems, through the favour of the Under-Jaylor, (as some of the People in the Town informed me) of coming frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together, He perswaded his Servant to take the whole upon her, and that if he was acquitted, he would get a Pardon for her.</p>
            <p>His Servant (as I was acquainted by some of my Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that heard the Tryal) when she was brought to the Bar before the Honourable Sir <hi>Thomas-Street,</hi> one of His Majesties Judges of Assize for the <hi>Oxford</hi> Circuit, being ask't whether she was Guilty or not, she then pleaded her own Guilt, and her Masters Innocency; her Master continu'd obstinately denying the Fact; and that he was not in the least Guilty; but the Jury going out upon him, brought him in equally guilty of that Crime, which his Servant had took upon her self, and after that, the day following, Sentence past upon them both: <hi>Cupper</hi> to be Hang'd in <hi>Chains</hi> in the <hi>Old Field</hi> near <hi>Ludlow</hi>; and <hi>Judith Brown</hi> to be burnt for poysoning her Mistress.</p>
            <p>When she saw her self under the Sentence of Condemnation, she pleaded her Belly; and was respited till her Delivery, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29885:5"/>
when she was delivered of a Man-Child, which she Father'd upon one <hi>Nott,</hi> her Execution was deferred for a Month, or longer. But <hi>Cupper</hi> was brought to be executed in the <hi>Old Field</hi> near <hi>Ludlow,</hi> the twenty fourth day of <hi>July.</hi> I met him on the way at <hi>Roger Burton's</hi> House in <hi>Onybury,</hi> where the Officers staid about two hours with him. And after Prayers with this poor condemned Malefactor, I then privately put him upon that which before he had denyed in Prison, <hi>viz.</hi> The Poysoning of his Wife; he then confessed it presently, and withal told me, That <hi>Judith Brown</hi> and he had attempted it several times after his Wife had lain in her Mouth, and finding that through the strength of her Body, she had workt off small Potions infused sometimes in Milk, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Beer, at last they were resolved to give her a greater quantity, of <hi>White Arsenick</hi> in Milk. After she had eaten the Milk, a violent Vomiting and Purging seiz'd her, and being very thirsty, called for Water to drink; they think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her then in a fair way to have their ends bring her Water with more <hi>Arsenick</hi> infused in it; and after the drinking of it, being violently torn in her Stomach, a Neigbbour coming in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally to see her, <hi>Cupper</hi>'s Wife told her they had given her her last, and she not long after dy'd.</p>
            <p>After he had thus confest his Guilt towards his Wife, I ask't him about the death of his two Children; it being reported that he had murthered them: this he denyed, and told me he had never any thoughts of ill towards them; and that the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of scalding Pitch falling upon one of them, hastened its end which had troubled him very much; and that the other dyed of a Natural Death, which his Neighbours could not but be well satisfied about.</p>
            <p>Then I enquired of him, Whether he had been Guilty of steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sheep upon the <hi>Clee-hill,</hi> or not, having been long suspected: He answered, That he was <hi>Innocent</hi>; and wisht he had been as Guiltless towards his Wife, that then he had never come to so shameful an end, as he was presently like to do, in the view of all his Neighbours and Acquaintance. I desir'd him to tell me truly, whether he knew of any about the Hill, that were Sheep stealers, and advised him to have a care that he did not die with a Lie in his mouth, or any thing that then might burthen his Conscience.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29885:5"/>
He told me he would have a care of that; and said he knew of none; only there was a common Report in the Neighbourhood, That there was a Person in the Township of <hi>Snitton</hi> given that way; but he knew nothing of it.</p>
            <p>What relates to the <hi>Scotchman</hi> that was murthered some years since on the <hi>Clee,</hi> of which he was suspected, I know nothing of, I my self being but lately setled in the Parish; and no man in his Wits can think that I could charge him with that I never heard of, till the Execution of the Criminal; nor did he mention the least tittle of it to me.</p>
            <p>All he further confest to me, was, That he had had Carnal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Servant <hi>Judith</hi> twice the Month before his Wife was brought to Bed, and though she was with Child, yet she was not so by him, but by another that was conversant with her before.</p>
            <p>And now in Contemplation of approaching Death and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with tears at the Gibbet he bewails this wicked Act of poysoning his Wife, and all other Sins that he was guilty of, and with a heart swell'd with the dreadful thoughts of his sad Condition, repeats that excellent Prayer for Condemned Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, written by Dr. <hi>Patrick</hi> in his <hi>Devout Christian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he had ended that Prayer, after a Psalm, I joyned with him in another, and then rising up, the Chains were presently fastened to his Body; then in another short Prayer he desired that God would ease his disturbed mind, his wounded and deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soul, heartily praying that God would ease his broken heart, hoping in his Goodness, that now crying and bewailing his sins, God would hear him; and then going up the Ladder about the middle, he turn'd to the People, acknowledged his faults, for which he suffered, and begg'd of them to pray for him, that his Soul might be saved, and begg'd Young and Old to take warning by him, and was Turn'd off.</p>
            <p>The one and twentieth of <hi>August, Judith Brown</hi> was Burnt at <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> where she confest (as appears by Captain <hi>Reignolds</hi> Paper sent me) she consented with her Master to poyson her Mistress, and her Master was the cause of bringing her to that unhappy end; desiring that all would take Example by her just and shameful Death, and so was consum'd to Ashes in a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Bed of Flames.</p>
            <p>Thus both underwent the due punishment of their hainous
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29885:6"/>
Crimes, contriv'd and executed upon a poor and unhappy Wretch, a Wife to the one, and a Mistress to the other.</p>
            <p>Let me desire every one to examine himself to the bottom, touching all crying sins, particularly touching Cruelty. God himself is rigorous in the scrutiny he makes in any Bloody Crimes: As if he would upon occasion take the Coroners In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest into his own hand, he himself maketh Inquisition for Blood.</p>
            <p>These two Wretches that were justly Executed, had time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough after the Fact to have fled from the rigour of the Law, having the opportunity of four or five days to make their Escape; but surpriz'd with the Villanousness of the Action, and their Consciences being harrast with the sense of Guilt, they could not flee, but Justice necessarily took hold upon them.</p>
            <p>It hath past into a Proverb long since, That <hi>Murder will out,</hi> and the History of all Ages affords us wonderful Discoveries of it. Wherefore we ought to take warning, and not to suffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny revengeful Inclinations to harbour in our minds, no Cruelty to Neighbours, no Bloody Practises against Parents or Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: If we give way to these things our hearts becoming har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened through the deceitfulness of sin, no wonder if the blackest Crimes do follow, and one wickedness slily draw on another. These despicable Wretches neglected Instruction, hated to be reform'd, lived in all manner of Licentiousness, prophaned the Sabbath, slighted Ordinances. The Master often engaged in Quarrels, both at home and abroad, would not be perswaded, but still persisted in Wickedness, and we have seen the End, a sad and a shameful End; a way of Dying abhorr'd by Good Men, and the Wicked may tremble at it, and learn to amend their Lives, to become better Christians than they have been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: which God of his Infinite Mercy grant, through <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> our <hi>Lord.</hi>
