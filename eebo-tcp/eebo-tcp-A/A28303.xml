            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It was your deſire (which with me hath, and ever ſhall have the force of a command)

They have all caſt themſelves (as it were) at your feet, ſaying, This is the man we will have to rule over us. Thus ſhall it be done unto the man, whom <hi>London</hi> will honour, and thus has it been done to you. And now, will not you honour <hi>London</hi> my Lord, that has thus honoured you?

            <p>The firſt is taken from the perſon they <hi>repreſent</hi> in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>The Lord. For ye judge not for man; but for the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not for man.</hi> It is not to be underſtood negatively, but comparatively.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.6.</note> As that, <hi>God will have mercie and not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi> Sacrifice too; but mercie <hi>rather</hi> then Sacrifice.

So <hi>Treme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Non tam hominis, quam Dei vices in judicando geritis.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, In this great work ye ſuſtain, not ſo much my perſon, as Gods perſon; nor are ye ſo much my Vicegerents, as Gods Vicegerents; my Deputies as Gods Deputies; therefore, <hi>take heed what you doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is taken from the perſon <hi>preſent</hi> with them in Judgement, and that's the Lord too. <hi>But for the Lord, who is</hi> with you <hi>in the judgement.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, you doe not onely <hi>repreſent</hi> God in the judgement, but God is <hi>preſent</hi> with you in the judgement. He ſits as Lord chiefe Juſtice upon the ſame bench with you; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>take heed what you doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, you have the main help preſcribed; and that's the fear of God. <hi>Now therefore let the fear of the Lord be upon you.</hi> The true fear of God in the heart of a Judge, firſt it wil <hi>Reſtrain</hi> him from every evil. Other Governours did thus and thus, were injurious, were oppreſſing, &amp;c. but <note place="margin">Neh. 5 15.</note>

            </p>
            <p>All men ought to be ſo.</p>
            <p>The divers aſſaults of Satan to deceive us. The ſundry inticements of the fleſh to beguile us. The many allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world to enſnare us. All declare as much.</p>

            <p>But above all Magiſtrates had need to doe ſo, for why?</p>
            <p>Firſt, They have a larger, and greater care, and charge, committed to them, by the Lord, then others have. And that,</p>
            <p n="1">1 In regard of places. Other's, their care, and charge is ſhut up and contained within narrower and ſtraiter bounds and limits then their's is.

            <p>A Magiſtrate he is a publike perſon; and therefore a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like good, or a publike evill. If <hi>he</hi> be careleſſe, negligent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55823:7"/>
unjuſt, abuſe his authoritie, neglect his dutie, what's the iſſue? Religion degenerates into Idolatry and Superſtition. The publike miniſtery of the word, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means of ſalvation, are either wholly neglected, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſlighted. Wicked men incouraged. Godly men diſcountenanced. Nothing but Ataxie, Diſorder, Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in Church, in Common-wealth. Men cannot poſſeſſe their lives, their eſtates, their names, their — any thing in peace, in quiet. Whereas, on the other ſide, if Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates be wiſe, faithfull, carefull, vigilant, intentive, God will be worſhipped purely; the Miniſterie of the word pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed highly; evill men puniſhed; good men protected; And all knit together in ſuch an order, that every one will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward what he can the peace, proſperitie, welfare, good, comfort of another; and every one poſſeſſe and enjoy his life, his goods, his good name, his — all in peace, in ſafetie, in ſecuritie.</p>
            <p>This is cleer by the ſtate of the Kingdomes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi> When they had <hi>good</hi> Magiſtrates, as <hi>David; Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Joſia, Hezekiah,</hi> &amp;c. How did every thing flouriſh that concerned either the glorie of God, or the profit, and benefit, and comfort of men, both for ſoul and bodie? But when the Magiſtrates were Idolatrous, Tyrannous, Vicious, Then all went to wrack. And wee ſee it by our own ſad experience. And therefore <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> 10.16, 17. <hi>Woe to thee ô Land, when thy King is a child, and thy Princes eat in the morning. And bleſſed art thou ô Land, when thy King is the ſonne Nobles, and thy Princes eat in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for ſtrength, and not for drunkenneſſe,</hi> ſayes <hi>Solomon.</hi> That Land is happy that has good Magiſtrates; and the contrary, moſt miſerable and unhappy. For theſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other reaſons, Judges and Magiſtrates, men ſet apart for the guiding, and governing, and ordering of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55823:8"/>
or Counties, or Cities, ought in a more eſpeciall manner to take heed what they do.</p>
            <p>And that in <hi>all</hi> their actions, Naturall, Civill, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In their <hi>whole</hi> converſations.</p>
            <p>The ordering of their Families. There Children. Their Servants; Thoſe they employ in managing their publike Affairs; Thoſe too they employ in managing their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick or Houſhold buſineſſes and occaſions; to ſee that they be ſuch as be faithfull in their dutie to <hi>them,</hi> their maſters on earth; mindfull of their dutie to <hi>God,</hi> their maſter in Heaven. That they be pious, religious, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious, ſuch as feare God, ſuch as will diſcharge the truſt committed to them. <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.5.</note>
               <hi>If a man know not how to rule his owne houſe, how ſhall he take care of the Church of God?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle of Miniſters; and it's true of Magiſtrates as well. How ſhall hee be able to governe a Citie, that cannot go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his own Family?</p>
            <p>The ordering of their perſons too. Above all men in the world, Magiſtrates had need to take heed that their lives be holy, harmleſſe, righteous, religious. Such as may adorn their profeſſion. Such as may put an honour, a luſtre upon Religion. Such whereby they may be an example of good to all, of evill to none. For why?</p>
            <p>Firſt, with what face can a Magiſtrate puniſh ſin in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if guiltie of the ſame ſin himſelf? A drunken Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, A ſwearing Magiſtrate, A whoring Magiſtrate, A Sabboath-breaking Magiſtrate, how can he puniſh drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in others, oaths in others, uncleanneſſe in others, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe of Gods day in others?</p>
            <p>Secondly, The excellencie of their office requires it. Magiſtracie, It's a viſible character of an inviſible Deity. They are called Gods, <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods: Pſal.</hi> 82. And what, a drunken God! a ſwearing God! a Sabboth-breaking
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55823:8"/>
God! a prophane vicious God! It's no leſſe then blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The eminencie of their place requires it.</p>
            <p>They are as a City ſet upon a hill. All mens eys are upon them. Their lives are exemplary. Men are led by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple much; and by the example of Magiſtrates, more then by the examples of other men, <hi>Reges ad exemplum; &amp;c.</hi> Magiſtrates lives, they are the peoples rules. And of all things a rule ſhould be ſtrait. A falſe rule! a crooked rule! it's moſt dangerous.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Example in them doth more good, or more hurt. A mighty force in the example of Magiſtrates. <hi>Have any of the Rulers believed in him? John.</hi> 7.48. The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Rulers kept many from believing. Evill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in Magiſtrates, is more infectious, more contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. <hi>Jeroboams</hi> ſin, it made <hi>All Iſrael</hi> to ſin. If Magiſtrates be wicked, how will wicked men be animated, imbold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, incouraged in their wicked wayes? Not a greater provocation in the world to a wicked life, then a wicked Magiſtrate. God will be diſhonoured more; his people grieved more; wicked men imboldned more; the Land in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered more, defiled more: from them as from a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, prophanneſſe, wickedneſſe, ungodlineſſe will flow forth into all the Land, as the Prophet ſpeaks of the wicked prieſts of his time, <hi>Jer. 23.15.</hi> Therefore above all men in the world, Magiſtrates had need to take heed wihat they do. And that even in All their actions, in their whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But eſpecially in the adminiſtration of juſtice, in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their office, in matter of government, in point of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in their judiciary proceedings.</hi> That is, 1 In hearing cauſes that are brought before them. 2 In paſſing ſentence when they have heard them. 3 In executing that ſentence

And <hi>here,</hi> mighty warineſſe, and caution, and circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is required of Magiſtrates; <hi>here,</hi> they had need to take heed what they doe. As namely, that they doe it,</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſpeedily. Without demurs, delays, procraſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (beyond what is neceſſary.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:55823:9"/>Secondly. Meekly, mildly, patiently; not in paſſion, in anger, in wrath: <note place="margin">Iam 1.10.</note>

            <p>Thirdly. Diligently; not oſcitantly, ſluggiſhly, ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, ſleepily; as <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> once, who by that means gave wrong ſentence; ſo that the partie was fain to appeal from <hi>Philip</hi> ſleeping, to <hi>Philip</hi> waking.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. Equally too, indifferently. Heare ſmall, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as great; poore, as well as rich; Stranger, as well as brother. And heare <hi>both</hi> parties; <hi>both</hi> ſides. <hi>Plutarch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that when he ſate in judgment, he was wont <hi>(alteram aurem praebere actori, alteram verò integram ſervarereo)</hi> always to ſtop one eare to the Plaintiffe, ſaying, he kept that for the Defendant. <hi>Condemne no man before he which is accuſed, hath his accuſer face to face, and hath liberty to anſwer for himſelf, concerning the thing laid to his charge.</hi> It was a Rule among the <hi>Romans</hi>; And it was a good Rule, for why? <note place="margin">Act. 25 16.

And ſo on th'other ſide, no cauſe ſo good, but through the modeſtie, or unskilfulneſſe, or unfaithfulneſſe of thoſe that plead it, it may poſſibly ſeeme bad.

               </gap> as <hi>Baſil</hi> ſpeaks, a ſharpe and exact underſtanding, to diſcerne between the modeſty of the innocent plaintiff, and the malice of the envious defendant, he had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been deceived. <hi>Quibus boneſtior conſcientia, iis plerum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que frons imbecillior,</hi> ſayes <hi>Jerome.</hi> Diſhoneſty many times (like <hi>Tamar</hi>) is vailed with a maske of fair words, and a ſmooth tongue; when innocencie is timorous and unelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. Therefore, <hi>Juſtitia,</hi> though it ſhould be <hi>coeca in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equendo,</hi> yet it muſt be <hi>oculata in dijudicando,</hi> impartially blinde in <hi>executing,</hi> but eagle-ey'd in ſearching out a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>That's the firſt thing, Judges muſt take heed what they doe in <hi>Hearing</hi> cauſes. Let the cauſe be opened; let evidences be produced; let the accuſed and the accuſer bee brought face to face; Let them get a manifeſt cognizance of the thing, by a fair, free, calme, hearing of matters on both ſides, before they paſſe ſentence.</p>
            <p>For why? Poſſibly they may erre elſe. Nay, it's almoſt impoſſible but they ſhould erre elſe. However, unjuſt they ſhall be <hi>ſure</hi> to be; yea, (<hi>aequum licet ſtatuerint,</hi> as the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goedian) though poſſibly they ſhould light upon the right. Though the Judgement ſhould be juſt, yet the Judge ſhould be unjuſt.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that commence ſuits; Thoſe that plead and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute ſuits; Thoſe that teſtifie and give in evidence; Thoſe that bring in verdict. All had need to take heed what they doe, that they carry themſelves as in the preſence of God; and doe nothing in theſe caſes before Gods Vicegerents, which they would not doe before God himſelfe, whoſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55823:10"/>
judgement it is, and who is with them in the judgement.</p>
            <p>But above all, Judges had need to take heed; Becauſe when all have ſaid all they can, ſtill the judgment lyes in the judges breſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In paſſing ſentence. Judges muſt heare cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſpeedily, patiently, diligently, indifferently, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly; and when they have ſo heard them, they muſt paſſe ſentence. And here likewiſe abundance of warineſſe and circumſpection is required of Judges. Judges had need to take heed what they doe; as namely, that they do it. 1 Righteouſly. <hi>Heare the cauſes betwixt man and man, and judge righteouſly, Deut. 1, 16.</hi> with equability, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.

            <p n="1">1 To the minde of toe Law.

            <p n="2">2 According to the quality of the offence. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> that heathen King, even by the light of <hi>nature</hi> preſcribed this rule: <hi>That every one that ſhould offend, ſhould be ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced According to his offence, ſome to death, ſome to baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſame to confiſcation of goods, ſome to impriſonment Ezra. 7.26.</hi> As there is a difference of offences, ſo there muſt be a difference of puniſhments.

            <p>Freely. A Iudge ſhould not be moved, either <hi>minis,</hi> or <hi>donis.</hi> With threats, or gifts.

there are caſes wherein a Judge muſt not ſpare.

            <p n="3">3 In executing ſentence. A Judge when he hath heard the cauſe, and pronounced ſentence, muſt execute that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>Three things make a happy Common-wealth: Good Laws; Upright judgement according to thoſe Laws; And juſt execution. And herein likewiſe, Judges muſt take heed what they doe. As namely:</p>
            <p n="1">1 That they doe it with all the grains of allowance, of time, of mercie, of clemencie, that juſtice will permit; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if to life.</p>
            <p n="2">

Of the Jews five times, received I forty ſtripes ſave one,</hi> ſayes <hi>Paul.</hi> They bated him one.</p>
            <p n="3">3 With aboundance of compaſſion. If the judgement be ſevere, and ſuch as cannot juſtly or ſafely admit of any further delay, or any remiſneſſe or mitigation, by reaſon of the haynouſneſſe and atrocitie of the crime, yet even then he muſt doe it, not with inſolence, and elation, and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and reproachfull ſpeeches, &amp;c. but with all the meekneſſe and demonſtration of compaſſion that may be. <hi>My ſonne give glory to God,</hi> ſayes <hi>Joſhua</hi> to <hi>Achan</hi>; he calls him <hi>his Sonne.</hi> What ever the puniſhment be, mercie and compaſſion muſt be uſed in the inflicting of it. Muſt not by any cruell courſe make the torture either greater or longer then neceſſity requires; for why? <hi>Duo ſunt nomina</hi> ſayes <hi>Auſtin, homo &amp; peccator</hi>; As he is a malefactor, puniſh him; but yet as he is a man, pitty him.</p>
            <p>Thus in all their actions, in their whole converſations; but eſpecially in matters of judgement, in their judiciary proceedings; as in hearing cauſes that are brought before them; in paſſing ſentence; in executing that ſentence; in all theſe, Iudges and Magiſtrates ought to be men of marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous caution and circumſpection.</p>
            <p>And thus we have done with the explication of the point.</p>

And what is it for a Iudge to have <hi>lucrum in arca, &amp; damnum in conſcientia?</hi> as <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſpeaks; Gaine in his Coffer, and loſſe in his Conſcience? A full purſe, a foul ſoul?

The burthen's too heavie for you; aye, but God will put under his own ſhoulders; you ſhall be aſſiſted by the great God. 2 <hi>With you,</hi> to protect you, defend you, ſafeguard you from wrongs, from hurts, from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences. Friends may frown; enemies may threaten; aye, but God is with you; and if God be with you, who can be againſt you? 3 <hi>With you,</hi> To behold all your procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. God ſtands in the aſſembly of gods. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.1. <hi>Stands.</hi> Not ſits, but <hi>ſtands.</hi> Stands to looke this way and that way, and the other way; to heare what this man ſayes, and what that man does. To heare who gives an <hi>I,</hi> when the nocent is to be puniſhed: who gives a <hi>No,</hi> when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent is to be quitted; Therefore take heed what you do. 4 <hi>With you,</hi> To reward your integritie; puniſh your partialitie. Remember that When ever you ſet foot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place of judgement; &amp; ſay as <hi>Jacob, Surely the Lord is in this place; ô how dreadfull is this place!</hi> The Lord is here, and he heares every word I ſpeak; and he ſees every action I doe. I have, not only men to behold mee; and Angels to behold me; but even God himſelf, he is preſent with me. There was a Canon made; in the <hi>Chalcedon</hi> and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55823:16"/>
               <hi>Epheſine</hi> Councell, that upon the Judges Bench, the Book of the Goſpell ſhould be ſet up, which the Judges were to caſt their eyes upon, to the end they might doe every thing according to the minde of Chriſt. And the <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi> were wont to ſet up a Chaire of State in their Senate, and that to be emptie; as if the God of judgement ſate there as Umpire, and Moderator; whom the Senators ought to look upon in paſſing ſentence, that they might imitate him in their judgment, to the end they might doe every thing as in the ſight of God, who (as the text ſays) is <hi>with them in the judgement.</hi> Theſe are the Reaſons in the text: You ſuſtain the perſon of God; ſit in the ſeat of God; execute the judgment of God; ſtand in the preſence of God, Therefore take heed what you doe. Execute Gods judgment, as God himſelf would execute it.</p>
            <p>Nay, yet more; you muſt be accountable to God too. Remember that. You muſt one day come to your <hi>Redde ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem, Give an account.</hi> You muſt appear, before that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, and unavoidable, and unappealable Tribunall of the Judge of all the world: and he'll heare all over again; and judge the Cauſe; and judge the Iudge; Iudge you; and judge all. And would you give any ſentence now, that ſhould then be reverſed? Would you give any ſentence now, you would then be aſhamed to own? Conſider that. you muſt give account to God. Not only to Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie, that little God in your boſomes, Conſcience; which will ſentence you ſeverely if you doe amiſſe; but to the great God, the judge of all the World; and Ieſus Chriſt the Iudge of quick and dead. <hi>God will bring to judgement every work, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. Take heed therefore what you doe</hi>; You will never be able to give up your account with joy elſe.</p>
            <p>Again. The nature, greatneſſe, and waightineſſe of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55823:17"/>
work you have to doe. The eaſineſſe of miſcarrying in it. The exceeding great danger if you do miſcarrie. All theſe call upon you <hi>to take heed what you doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 The nature, greatneſſe, and waightineſſe of the worke you have to doe. 1 It is <hi>Gods work,</hi> and therefore requires your utmoſt circumſpection. I have provided with all my might, ſays <hi>David.</hi> Why? <hi>The houſe is not for man, but for the Lord.</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.1. 2 It is a <hi>great</hi> worke. A worke of the greateſt and mightieſt concernment, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that ever did, or ever can come under your hands. 3 It's a <hi>perplex, intricate, difficult</hi> worke. So many knots; many Caſes ſo intricate; ô what a Labyrinth you will be in ſometimes? Your thoughts how they'll be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext, twiſted as it were, intwin'd one within another? how you will be troubled to diſcover your way, to finde your rule, to know what to do? 4 It is an <hi>excellent</hi> work. 5 An <hi>important</hi> work too. Your <hi>eternall</hi> ſalvation lyes upon it. Your, and our <hi>temporall</hi> ſalvation alſo, Lawes, Liberties, Lives, Goſpell, Religion, Church, State, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, all lyes upon it. According as you manage your work, even ſo may it fare with <hi>England</hi> for ought I know. and the children that are yet unborn, will have cauſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſtand up and bleſſe you; or to ſtand up and curſe you.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The eaſineſſe of miſcarrying in the work. Take heed what you doe; A thouſand to one but you will miſcarry elſe. For why? Firſt, you are but men. Gods indeed; but yet but earthen gods; Men, weak men, frail men, fleſh and bloud. You have the ſame carnall principles in your hearts, that are in the hearts of others. You have a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of pride in you; a principle of ſelf-love in you; a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of baſe, ſlaviſh fear in you; a principle of ambition; a principle of covetouſneſſe, &amp;c. 2 You have the ſame
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55823:17"/>
Devill; and the ſame World to draw forth thoſe principles too. Such temptations from Satan; ſuch ſolicitations from men; ſuch evaſions in offenders to avoid juſtice; friends intreatie; enemies obloquie; ſuch a world of ſnares; ſo many reſpects to worke upon your affections; ſo many occaſions to turne you out of the way; ſo many impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to juſtice; This relation and that relation, kindred, acquaintance, feare, favour, hope of reward, frownes, ſmiles.</p>
            <p>If they be rich ones and great ones that offend, ô they muſt be ſpared, they will ſit upon my skirts elſe another time, they'll be even with me. And if poor ones, yet if great ones become ſuitors for them, ô I muſt gratifie ſuch a great man, &amp;c. Oh how hard it is for a Iudge to deale juſtly, uprightly, impartially! Take heed therefore what you do, You will certainly miſcarrie elſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And if you doe, Oh how dangerous it is! that's the third thing. The exceeding great danger if you doe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrie: Danger to your ſelves: danger to others.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to your ſelves. To erre in judgement; eſpecially wittingly and willingly, Oh it is a fearfull ſin. Called a <hi>manifold tranſgreſsion,</hi> and a <hi>mighty ſin,</hi> Amos 5.<hi>12.</hi> And you are ſaid herein, even to <hi>exceed the deeds of the wicked, Jer.</hi> 5.28. How many dreadfull woes ſtand regiſtred in the book of God againſt this ſin? See <hi>Eſay</hi> 5.20. &amp;c. No ſin more ſharply threatned; no ſin more ſeverely puniſhed; in perſons, in Nations. It's a ſin that makes you guiltie of <hi>other</hi> mens ſins. A man may be guiltie of other mens ſins; not onely poſitively, when he conſents to them, councels them, incourages them, countenances them, and the like; but privatively alſo, when he indulges them, connives at them, &amp;c. In this caſe, <hi>all</hi> the wickedneſſe others doe, it's <hi>You</hi> that doe it; <hi>you</hi> be the murtherers; and <hi>you</hi> be the Saboth-breakers,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55823:18"/>
and <hi>you</hi> be the ſwearers; and <hi>you</hi> be the drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard., &amp;c. It's not <hi>they</hi> that doe it, it's <hi>you</hi> that doe it; it's the <hi>Court of juſtice</hi> that doth it. It's a ſin of bloud. The ſin of bloud, oh it's a fearfull ſin; &amp; if you erre in judgement, if you condemne whom God would abſolve, or abſolve whom God would condemne, you pull upon your ſelves the guilt of bloud; you take the bloud that lies upon others and lay it upon your own heads. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt let goe a man, whom I appointed to deſtruction; therfore, thy life ſhall goe for his life, and thy people for his people,</hi> ſayes the Lord to <hi>Ahab. 1 King. 20.42.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Danger to others too; to the State, to the Kingdom. Take heed what you doe; you'l indanger the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome elſe; involve the whole Kingdom in bloud; be State murtherers, Kingdome-deſtroyers. And whereas if you had carried your ſelves religiouſly, piouſly, ſincerely in your worke, you might have <hi>quenched</hi> the fire of Gods wrath, <hi>Pſal. 146.31.</hi> you will <hi>kindle it more.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as had you executed judgement, you might have removed the judgements that are upon the Land; you will <hi>pull down</hi> yet heavier and ſorer judgements.</p>
            <p>It's a dreadfull place, that <hi>Amos</hi> 5. <hi>Yee who turne judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to wormewood, and leave off righteouſneſſe in the earth</hi>; (ver. 7) <hi>I know your manifold tranſgreſsions and your mighty ſins; You afflict the juſt, you take a bribe, you turne aſide</hi> the <hi>poore in the gate from their right,</hi> &amp;c. (ver. 12.) well, and what follows? <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, Wailing ſhall be in all ſtreets, and in all high places they ſhall cry Alas, Alas; and they ſhall call the husbandmen to mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſuch as are skilfull in lamentation to wailing,</hi> (ver. 16.) <hi>And the day of the Lord ſhall be darkneſſe, and not light, even very darkneſſe, and no brightneſſe in it.</hi> (ver. 20.) So Jeremiah 4. <hi>They judge not the cauſe of the fatherleſſe,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55823:18"/>
and the right of the needy doe they not judge,</hi> (ver. 28.) well, and what follows? <hi>Shall I not viſit for theſe things? ſayes the Lord, ſhall not my ſoul be avenged on ſuch a nation as this?</hi> (ver. 29.) The want of due execution of judgement, puls down Gods heavieſt judgements upon a Land. <hi>Take heed therefore what you doe,</hi> you will elſe <hi>undoe</hi> the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And will <hi>you</hi> be the perſons that will <hi>undoe</hi> England?</p>
            <p>Suppoſe God ſhould yet diſappoint all our hopes, and bring in all our fears, and fire and ſword ſhould overrun even the whole land, and the enemie ſhould begirt our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry walls, and we ſhould heare the alarm of war in our very gates, and ſhould ſee torrents of bloud running down our ſtreets, our houſes burning, our wives raviſhing, our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren daſhing in pieces, and our ſelves running ſome of us to the tops of houſes, others to the bottomes of cellers, to hide our ſelves from the murtherer, all in an uprore; <hi>London</hi> ſtretching forth her hands, and crying out to all the world, as Jeruſalem once, behold and ſee if there bee any ſorrow like to my ſorrow; And in the midſt of theſe ſad combuſtions and confuſions, your conſciences ſhould ſtep in and tell you, (as the Prophet tells thoſe filthy prieſts of old, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.9.) <hi>This hath been by your means:</hi> England may thanke <hi>you</hi> for this; England might have been a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtill, if it had not been for <hi>you</hi>; Religion, the goſpell might have flouriſht in <hi>England</hi> ſtill, if it had not been for <hi>you</hi>; The worke of Reformation might have been carried on even to perfection, if it had not been for <hi>you.</hi> O how dreadfull would this be! where's the man whoſe very heart within him can chooſe but tremble to think, leaſt <hi>he</hi> ſhould be the man with whom it ſhould be thus? Now the good Lord of heaven ſtartle you, rouſe you, awaken you! The good Lord of heaven make you ſerious in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe! God will be diſhonoured elſe; his wrath provoked;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55823:19"/>
againſt your ſelves, againſt the Land; his people grieved; wicked men animated, encouraged, emboldened in their wicked ways. <hi>Maxima peccandi illecebra, impunitatis ſpes.</hi> Not a greater provocation in the world to ſin, then hope of impunitie. And <hi>within,</hi> your conſciences they'l accuſe you. And <hi>without,</hi> the complaints &amp; ſighs, &amp; groans, and tears of the oppreſſed, they'll cry to Heaven againſt you. And the oaths, blaſphemies, drunkenneſſes, uncleanneſſes, propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Lord's Day, &amp;c. which you might have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and did not, they'll cry to heaven againſt you. And will not all this prevaile with you? Why I beſeech you, by all that's dear to you; As you tender the glory of God; As you tender the ſafetie, and ſecuritie, and proſperitie of this great Citie; yea, and of this whole Nation; As you ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the peace of your owne conſciences; yea, and the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſalvation of your ſouls; in the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt I beſeech you, <hi>Take heed what you doe.</hi>

               <p>ANd now, my honorable Lord, give me leave I beſeech you, to addreſs my ſelf in a few words to you.

Truly my Lord, I have not the leaſt jealouſie or ſuſpition, either that you will not <hi>take heed and do it</hi>; or that you will not <hi>take heed what you do.</hi> I am confident you have <hi>ſtudied</hi> your dutie; &amp; I am as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fident you are <hi>reſolved,</hi> through the mightie aſſiſtance of Gods grace and ſpirit, to ſtirre up your ſelfe, even to the verie utmoſt, to <hi>doe</hi> your dutie.

               <p>Such a mightie ſpirit of praier in the hearts of Gods people too. It's admirable to ſee how the ſpirits of God's people are drawn out in this ſervice everie where.

               <p>The ice is alreadie broken too. The worke begun. Aie, and carried on a great way too. What Monſters had <hi>your</hi> Predeceſſors to grapple with? what a mightie ſpirit of Antipathie againſt a Reformation? what ſtratagems? what plots? what deſperate deſignes? what inſurrections? what tumults? All was in an uprore; and wee were upon the verie brinke of ruine everie day. This is all <hi>now</hi> huſht, and quaſht in a gracious meaſure. The Cauſe was then more doubtfull; the malignants here in the Citie more powerfull, higher in their hopes too; how did they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud themſelves, rejoycing and triumphing as thoſe that put off the harneſſe after victorie? How did <hi>Rome</hi> triumph? &amp; how did the Romiſh faction here in <hi>England</hi> triumph? It's otherwiſe now. God hath taken off their charriot wheeles (as I may ſay) and though they drive ſtill, yet bleſſed be God, they drive but heavily. And what heards and droves of vitious, ſcandalous, ſuperſtitious Miniſters were then in the City, what a deal of unſavorie ſalt? That's now caſt upon the dunghill. And what ſwarms of Atheiſts, Papiſts, prophane perſons, that are now gone? and what a deale of doe about a Service-Book, and about a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and about ſuperſtitious pictures, &amp;c? Our Worthies in Parliament were at a ſtand, knew not what to doe; every one was at his wits end, knew not what courſe to take.</p>
               <p>The beginnings of reformation evermore meet with the greateſt difficulties, and with the ſtrongeſt and mightieſt obſtructions and oppoſitions. Iſraels <hi>greateſt</hi> ſtrait was at the red ſea. Indeed, when they were in the <hi>Wildernes,</hi> there
