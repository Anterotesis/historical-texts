            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This ſcarcity ſhall not come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; God ſhall call for it: what euer be the ſecond cauſe, he is the firſt.

The fields of <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> flouriſh, whiles the ſoyle of <hi>Iſrael</hi> yeelds nothing but weeds and barrenneſſe: Not that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was more ſinfull, but that the ſin of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is more intolerable. The offers of grace are ſo many aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations of wickedneſſe: In equall offences thoſe doe iuſtly ſmart

All went by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries with this <hi>Shunamite;</hi> In the famine ſhe had enough, in the common plenty ſhe was ſcanted; <hi>Philiſtines</hi> were kinde to her, <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> cruell: Both our feares, and our hopes doe not ſeldome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3839:9"/>
vs; It is ſafe truſting to that ſtay which can neuer faile vs; who can eaſily prouide vs both of friendſhip in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and of iuſtice in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Wee may not iudge of the religion by particular actions; A very <hi>Philiſtine</hi> may be mercifull, when an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt; The perſon may be faulty, when the profeſsion is holy.</p>
                     <p>It was not long ſince the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet made that friendly offer to the <hi>Shunamite,</hi> out of the deſire of a thankfull requitall; <hi>VVhat is to be done for thee? wouldeſt thou be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for to the King, or to the Captaine of the Hoſt?</hi> and ſhe anſwered; <hi>I dwell among my brethren.</hi> Little did ſhe then thinke of this iniurious meaſure; elſe ſhe might haue ſaid; I dwell amongſt mine enemies, I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3839:10"/>
dwell amongſt robbers. It is like they were then friendly, who were now cruell, and oppreſsiue; There is no truſt to be repoſed in fleſh and blood: How ſhould their fauors be conſtant, who are in their nature, and diſpoſition, variable? It is the fureſt way to relye on him, who is euer like himſelfe; the meaſure of whoſe loue is eternitie.</p>
                     <p>Whither ſhould the <hi>Shunamite</hi> goe to complaine of her wrong, but to the Court? There is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuge of the oppreſſed, but publike authoritie: All Iuſtice is deriued from Soueraignty: Kings are not called Gods for nothing; They doe both ſentence and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute for the Almighty.</p>
                     <p>Doubtleſſe, now the poore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3839:10"/>
                        <hi>Shunamite</hi> thought of the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous profer of <hi>Eliſha;</hi> and miſsing a friend at the Court, is glad to be the preſenter of her owne peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>How happily doth God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue all euents for the good of his! This ſuppliant ſhall fall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that inſtant for her ſuit, when the King ſhall bee talking with <hi>Gehezi;</hi> when <hi>Gehezi</hi> ſhall bee talking of her, to the King; The words of <hi>Gehezi,</hi> the thoughts of the King, the deſires of the <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namite</hi> ſhall be all drawne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the wiſe prouidence of God into the center of one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that his oppreſſed ſeruant might receiue a ſpeedy iuſtice. Oh the infinite wiſedome, power, mercy of our God, that inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3839:11"/>
orders all our wayes, as to his owne holy purpoſes, ſo to our beſt aduantage.</p>
                     <p>What doth <hi>Iehoram</hi> the King talking with <hi>Gehezi</hi> the Leper? That very preſence was an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore.</p>
                     <p>But if the cohabitation with the infectious were forbidden, yet not the conference. Certainly, I begin to thinke of ſome good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in both theſe: Had there not beene ſome goodneſſe in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horam,</hi> he had not taken pleaſure to heare, euen from a leprous mouth, the miraculous acts and praiſes of Gods Prophet; Had there not beene ſome goodneſſe in <hi>Gehezi,</hi> he had not after ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full an infliction of iudgment, thus ingenuouſly recounted the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3839:11"/>
praiſes of his ſeuere Maſter; Hee that told that deare-bought lye to the Prophet, tells now all truths of the Prophet, to the King: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps his leproſie had made him cleane; If ſo: Happy was it for him that his forhead was white with the diſeaſe, if his ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came hereupon white with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. But wee may well know that the deſire, or report of hiſtoricall Truths, doth not alwayes argue grace. Still <hi>Iehoram,</hi> after the inquiry of the Prophets miracles, continues his Idolatry. He that was curious to harken af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the wonders of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> is not carefull to follow his doctrine; Therefore are <hi>Gehezi</hi> and the <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namite</hi> met before him, that hee may be conuicted, who will not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3839:12"/>
be reformed: Why was it els that the preſence of the perſons ſhould thus inexpectedly make good the relation, if God had not meant the inexcuſableneſſe of <hi>Iehoram;</hi> whiles he muſt needs ſay within himſelfe; Thus potent is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of that God, whom I obey not; Were not <hi>Eliſhaes,</hi> the true God, how could hee worke ſuch wonders? And if he be the true God, why is he not mine? But what? Shall I change <hi>Ahabs</hi> God for <hi>Iehoſaphats?</hi> No; I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the miracles, I will not admit of the author: Let <hi>Eliſha</hi> be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull, I will be conſtant. O wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <hi>Iehoram;</hi> how much better had it been for thee neuer to haue ſeene the face of <hi>Gehezi,</hi> and the ſon of the <hi>Shunamite;</hi> then to goe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3839:12"/>
away vnmoued with the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of leproſie in the one, with the mercifull reſuſcitation of the other? Therfore is thy iudgment fearfully aggrauated, becauſe thou wouldſt not yeeld to what thou couldſt not oppoſe. Had not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habs</hi> obdurateneſſe beene propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to his ſonne, ſo powerfull demonſtrations of diuine power could not haue been vneffectuall. Wicked hearts are ſo much worſe by how much God is better; This anvile is the harder by being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually beaten vpon, whether with iudgments, or mercy.</p>
                     <p>Yet this good vſe will God haue made of this report, and this preſence, that the poore <hi>Shunamite</hi> ſhall haue iuſtice; That ſonne, whoſe life was reſtored, ſhall
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3839:13"/>
haue his inheritance reuiued; His eſtate ſhall fare the better for <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhaes</hi> miracle: How much more will our mercifull God ſecond his owne bleſsings, when the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors of vniuſt men are therefore drawne to vs, becauſe wee haue beene the ſubiects of diuine bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.</p>
                     <p>It was a large, and full award, that this occurrence drew from the King; <hi>Reſtore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field, ſince the day that ſhe left the land, euen vntill now.</hi> Not the preſent poſſeſsion onely is giuen her, but the are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages.</p>
                     <p>Nothing hinders, but that outward iuſtice may ſtand with groſſe Idolatry. The Widow may thanke <hi>Eliſha</hi> for this; His miracle
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3839:13"/>
wrought ſtill; and put this new life into her dead eſtate; His ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence did that for the preſeruation of life, which his preſence did for the reſtoring it from death. Shee that was ſo ready to expoſtulate with the man of God, vpon the loſſe of her ſonne, might perhaps haue beene as ready to impute the loſſe of her eſtate to his aduice; Now, that for his ſake ſhee is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with her owne; how doth ſhee bleſſe God for ſo happy a gueſt? When we haue forgotten our owne good turnes, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members and crownes them: Let vs do good to all whiles we haue time, but eſpecially to the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of faith.</p>
                     <p>Could <hi>Iſrael</hi> haue beene ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their owne condition, it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3839:14"/>
was no ſmall vnhappineſſe to loſe the preſence of <hi>Eliſha:</hi> Whether, for the Idolatries, or for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Prophet is gone into <hi>Syria;</hi> No doubt <hi>Naaman</hi> welcomd him thither; and now would force vpon him thoſe thankes for his cure, which the man of God would not receiue at home.</p>
                     <p>How famous is he now grown that was taken from the Teame? His name is not confined to his owne Nation; Forraine countries take notice of it; and Kings are glad to liſten after him, and wooe him vvith preſents: <hi>Benhadad</hi> the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> whoſe counſells he had detected, reioyeeth to heare of his preſence; and now, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing forgotten that he had ſent a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3839:14"/>
vvhole hoſt, to beſiege the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in <hi>Dothan,</hi> ſends an honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meſſenger to him, laden with the burden of fourty Camels, to conſult with this Oracle, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ſickneſſe, and recouery.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Syrian</hi> belike in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe dares not truſt to his owne gods; but hauing had good proofe of the power of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> both in <hi>Naamans</hi> cure, and in the miraculous defeats of his greateſt forces, is glad to ſend to that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God, whom he had perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. Wicked men are not the ſame in health and in ſickneſſe: their affliction is worthy of the thankes, if they be well-minded; not themſelues.</p>
                     <p>Doubtleſſe the errand of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad</hi> was not onely to inquire of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3839:15"/>
the iſſue of his diſeaſe, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the prayers of the Prophet for a good iſſue: Euen the worſt man doth ſo loue himſelfe, that hee can be content to make a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall vſe of thoſe inſtruments, whoſe goodneſſe he hateth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hazael,</hi> the chiefe Peere of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> is deſigned to this meſſage; The wealth of his preſent ſtriues with the humility of his cariage, and ſpeech: <hi>Thy ſonne Benhadad King of Syria hath ſent me to thee, ſaying, Shall I recouer of this diſeaſe?</hi> Not long ſince, <hi>Iehoram</hi> King of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> had ſaid to <hi>Eliſha, My father, ſhall I ſmite them;</hi> and now <hi>Benha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> ſayes, <hi>My father, ſhall I recouer:</hi> Lo how this poore <hi>Meholathite</hi> hath Kings to his ſons: How great is the honor of Gods
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3839:15"/>
Prophets with Pagans, with Princes? Who can bee but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded to ſee Euangelicall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets deſpiſed by the meaneſt Chriſtians?</p>
                     <p>It is more then a ſingle anſwer that the Prophet returnes to this meſſage: One anſwer he giues to <hi>Benhadad,</hi> that ſent it; another hee giues to <hi>Hazael,</hi> that brings it: That to <hi>Benhadad,</hi> is, <hi>Thou maieſt ſurely recouer;</hi> That to <hi>Hazael, The Lord hath ſhewed me that he ſhall ſurely dye:</hi> What ſhall we ſay then? Is there a lye, or an equiuocation in the holy mouth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet? God forbid: It is one thing what ſhall be the nature, and iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of the diſeaſe; Another thing what may outwardly befall the perſon of <hi>Benhadad:</hi> The queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3839:16"/>
is moued of the former; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the anſwer is direct; The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is not mortall; But withall an intimation is giuen to the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, of an euent beyond the reach of his demand; which hee may know, but eyther needs not, or may not returne: <hi>The Lord hath ſhewed me that he ſhall ſurely dye;</hi> by another meanes, though not by the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>The Seer of God deſcries more in <hi>Hazael,</hi> then hee could ſee in himſelfe; hee fixes his eyes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtedfaſtly in the <hi>Syrians</hi> face, as one that in thoſe lines read the bloody ſtory of his life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hazael</hi> bluſhes, <hi>Eliſha</hi> weepes; The intention of thoſe eyes did not ſo much amaze <hi>Hazael,</hi> as the teares; As yet he vvas not guilty to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3839:16"/>
himſelfe of any wrong that might ſtraine out this iuyce of ſorrow: <hi>Why weepeth my Lord?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Prophet feares not to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell <hi>Hazael</hi> all the villanies which he ſhould once do to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> How he ſhould fire their forts, and kill their yong men, and rip the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and daſh the children. I maruell not now at the teares of thoſe eies which foreſaw this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable vaſtation of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of God; The very mention whereof is abhorred of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture author: <hi>What is thy ſeruant a dog, that I ſhould doe this great thing?</hi> They are ſauage cruelties where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou ſpeakeſt; It were more fit for mee to weepe that thou ſhouldeſt repute mee ſo brutiſh; I ſhould no leſſe condemne my
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3839:17"/>
ſelfe for a beaſt, if I could ſuſpect my owne degeneration ſo farre. Wicked men are caryed into thoſe heights of impiety, which they could not in their good mood haue poſsibly beleeued; Nature is ſubiect to fauourable opinions of it ſelfe; and will rather miſtruſt a Prophet of God, then her owne good diſpoſition: How many from honeſt beginnings, haue ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to incredible licentiouſneſſe, whoſe liues are now ſuch, that it were as hard for a man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue they had euer beene good, as to haue perſwaded them once they ſhould proue ſo deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ill.</p>
                     <p>To giue ſome ouerture vnto <hi>Hazael</hi> of the oportunitie of this enſuing miſchiefe; the Prophet
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3839:17"/>
foretells him from God, that hee ſhall be the King of <hi>Syria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He that ſhewes the euent, doth not appoint the meanes; Far was it from the ſpirit of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to ſet, or encourage a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: whiles hee ſaid therefore, <hi>Thou ſhalt be King of Syria;</hi> he ſaid not, Goe home, and kill thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: The wicked ambition of <hi>Hazael</hi> drawes this damnable concluſion out of holy premiſes; and now hauing fed the hopes of his Soueraigne with the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of recouery; the next day he ſmothers his Maſter. The impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent deſire of rule brookes no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay: Had not <hi>Hazael</hi> been grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly cruell, after hee had receiued this prediction of the Seer, hee ſhould haue patiently awaited for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3839:18"/>
the crowne of <hi>Syria,</hi> till lawfull meanes had ſet it vpon his head; now, he will by a cloſe execution make way to the throne; A wet cloth hath ſtopt the mouth of his ſicke Soueraigne; No noyſe is heard; the carcaſſe is faire; Who can complaine of any thing but the diſeaſe?</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Hazael,</hi> thou ſhalt not thus eaſily ſtop the mouth of thine owne conſcience; that ſhall call thee Traytor, euen in thy chaire of ſtate; and ſhall checke all thy royall triumphs, with, <hi>Thou haſt founded thy throne in blood.</hi> I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued if this wet cloth ſhall not wipe thy lips in thy iollyeſt feaſts, and make thy beſt morſells vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory: Soueraignty is painfull vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the faireſt termes; but vpon

                     <p>Hee that renued the life of the <hi>Shunamites</hi> ſonne, muſt ſtoope to age; That blocke lies in his way to <hi>Iehu;</hi> The aged Prophet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes a ſpeedier meſſenger, who muſt alſo gird vp his loynes, for

                     <p>The directions of <hi>Eliſha</hi> to the young Prophet, are full, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall: whither to goe; what to cary; what to doe; where to doe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3839:20"/>
it; what to ſay, what ſpeed to make, in his act, in his returne: In the buſineſſes of God it matters not how little is left to our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; There is no important buſineſſe of the Almighty, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his precepts are not ſtrict, and expreſſe; Looke how much more ſpecialty there is in the charge of God, ſo much more danger is in the violation.</p>
                     <p>The young Prophet is curiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedient; in his haſte; in his obſeruation and cariage: and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Iehu,</hi> according to <hi>Eliſhaes</hi> prediction, ſet amongſt the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the Hoſt, he ſingles him forth, by a reuerent compellation; <hi>I haue an errand to thee, O Captaine;</hi> Might not the Prophet haue ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the table had riſen, and then

                     <p>The inmoſt roome is but cloſe enough for this act; Ere many houres, all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall know that, which yet may not bee truſted with one eye; The goodneſſe of God makes wiſe prouiſion for the ſafety of his meſſengers, and whiles he imployes their ſeruice, preuents their dangers.</p>

                     <p>Oh the ſure, though patient, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Almighty: Not only <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iezebel</hi> had beene bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and idolatrous, but <hi>Iſrael</hi> was drawne into the partnerſhip of their crimes; All theſe ſhall ſhare in the iudgment: <hi>Elijahs</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint in the caue now receiues this late anſwer; <hi>Hazael</hi> ſhall plague <hi>Iſrael; Iehu</hi> ſhall plague the houſe of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iezebel; Eliſhaes</hi> ſeruant thus ſeconds <hi>Eliſhaes</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:

When wickednes is ripe in the field, God will not let it ſheed to grow againe, but cuts it vp by a iuſt, and ſeaſonable vengeance: <hi>Ahabs</hi> drouping vnder the threat hath put off the iudgment from his owne dayes; now it comes, and ſweepes away his wife, his iſſue; and falls heauy vpon his ſubiects. Pleaſe your ſelues, ô ye vaine ſinners, in the ſlow pace of vengeance; it will be neither leſſe certaine, nor more eaſie for the delay; rather it will pay for that leaſure in the extremitie.</p>
                     <p>The Prophet hath done his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, and is gone. <hi>Iehu</hi> returnes to his fellowes, with his head not more wet with oyle, then buſied with thoughts: no doubt, his face bewrayed ſome inward tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3839:23"/>
and diſtractions of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; neyther ſeem'd hee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the ſame he went out. They aske therefore, <hi>Is all well? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came this mad fellow to thee?</hi> The Prophets of God were to theſe idolatrous <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> like comets; who were neuer ſeene without the portendement of a miſchiefe: When the prieſts of their <hi>Baal</hi> were quietly ſacrificing, all was well; but now when a Prophet of God comes in ſight, their guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe askes, <hi>Is all well?</hi> All would be well but for their ſinnes; they feare not theſe, they feare their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iſrael</hi> was comne to a good paſſe, when the Prophets of God went with them for mad men: Oh ye <hi>Baalitiſh</hi> Ruffians, whither
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3839:23"/>
hath your impiety and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe caryed you, that ye ſhould thus blaſpheme the ſeruants of the liuing God? Ye that run on mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding after vaine Idols, taxe the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber guides of true worſhip, for madneſſe. Thus it becomes the godleſſe enemies of truth, the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds of our patience, to miſ-call our innocence, to reuile our moſt holy profeſſion: What wonder is it that Gods meſſengers are mad men vnto thoſe, to whom the wiſedome of God is fooliſhnes?</p>
                     <p>The meſſage was not deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Iehu</hi> for a concealment, but for publication: Silence could not effect the word that was told him; common notice muſt; <hi>Yee know the man, and his communication:</hi> The habit ſhowes you the man;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3839:24"/>
the calling ſhowes you his erra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: Euen Prophets were diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their clothes; Their mantle was not the common weare; why ſhould not this ſacred voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be knowne by a peculiar at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre? Theſe Captaines had not calld him a mad-man, if they had not knowne him a Prophet: By the man therefore they might gueſſe at his meſſage; Prophets doe not vſe to appeare, but vpon ſerious errands; whether of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, or of prediction.</p>
                     <p>Nice ciuilities of denialls were not then knowne to the world; They ſaid, <hi>It is falſe, tell vs now:</hi> Amongſt theſe Captains no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, no vnkindneſſe followes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a word ſo rudely familiar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iehu</hi> needs not tell them, that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3839:24"/>
the man was a Prophet; hee tels them the propheſie of the man; what he had ſaid, what hee had done.</p>
                     <p>Their eies had no ſooner ſeene the oyle; their eares had no ſooner heard, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I haue anointed thee King ouer Iſrael,</hi> then they riſe from their ſeates, as rapt with a tempeſt, and are hurled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to armes; So doe they haſt to proclaime <hi>Iehu,</hi> that they ſcarce ſtay to ſnatch vp their garments, which they had perhaps left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them for ſpeed, had they not meant with theſe rich abiliments to garniſh a ſtate for their new Soueraigne; To whom hauing now erected an extemporall Throne, they doe by the ſound of Trumpets giue the ſtyle of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3839:25"/>
Royalty, <hi>Iehu is King.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So much credit hath that mad fellow with theſe gallants of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> that vpon his word they will preſently aduenture their liues, &amp; change the Crowne. God giues a ſecret authority to his deſpiſed ſeruants; ſo as they which hate their perſon, yet reuerence their truth: Euen very ſcorners cannot but beleeue them; If when the Prophets of the Goſpell tell vs of a ſpirituall Kingdome, they be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted of thoſe which profeſſe to obſerue them, how ſhamefull is the diſproportion? how iuſt ſhall their iudgment be?</p>
                     <p>Yet I cannot ſay whether meer obedience to the Prophet, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall diſlikes of <hi>Iehoram,</hi> or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reſpects to <hi>Iehu,</hi> drew the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines

                     <p>Onely <hi>Ramoth</hi> is conſcious of this ſudden Inauguration; This new prince-dome yet reaches no further then the ſound of the trumpet: <hi>Iehu</hi> is no leſſe ſubtile, then valiant; he knew that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this inexpected change might worke a buſie, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reſiſtance; he therfore giues order that no meſſenger of the newes may preuent his perſonall execution, that ſo he might ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe <hi>Iehoram</hi> in his palace of <hi>Iz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reel,</hi> whether tending his late wounds, or ſecurely feaſting his friends, and dreaming of nothing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3839:26"/>
leſſe then danger; and might be ſeene, and felt at once. Secreſie is the ſafeſt gard of any deſigne; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed proiects are either fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or made needleſly difficult.</p>
                     <p>Neither is <hi>Iehu</hi> more cloſe, then ſwift; That very trumpet with the ſame wind ſounds his march; from the toppe of the ſtaires, he ſteps downe into his charet; That man meanes to ſpeed, who can bee at once reſerued in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and reſolute and quicke in his performances.</p>
                     <p>Who could but pity the vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and vnſeaſonable viſitation of the grand-childe of <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> were it not that hee was degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into the family of <hi>Abab?

                     <p>The two Kings are in the height of their complement, and entertainments, when the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Tower of <hi>Izreel</hi> eſpies a troupe, a farre off. For ought was knowne, there was nothing but peace in all the Land of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> was now ſo combined with it, that both their Kings were feaſting vnder one roofe; yet, in the midſt of this ſuppoſed ſafety, the watch-tower is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhed with heedy eyes: No ſecuritie of peace can free wiſe Gouernors from a carefull ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what may come, and a

prouidence againſt the worſt. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen whiles we know of no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the watch-tower of due in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence may not be empty.</p>
                     <p>In vaine are dangers fore-ſeen, if they be not premoniſhed; It is all one to haue a blind and a mute watch-man; This ſpeakes what he ſees; <hi>I ſee a company.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Doubtleſſe <hi>Iehorams</hi> head was now full of thoughts; neither knew hee what conſtruction to put vpon this approching troupe; Perhaps, the <hi>Syrians</hi> (hee thinkes) may haue recouered <hi>Ramoth;</hi> and chaſed the gariſon of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can hee imagine whether theſe ſhould be hoſtile victors, or vanquiſhed ſubiects, or conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring rebells. Euery way this rout was dreadfull. Oh <hi>Iehoram,</hi> thou
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3839:27"/>
beginſt thy feares too late; Hadſt thou beene afraid to prouoke the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thine innocency had yeelded no roome to theſe terrors.</p>
                     <p>An horſeman is diſpatcht to diſcouer the meaning of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcryed concourſe: Hee meets them, and inquires of peace; but receiues a ſhort anſwer, <hi>What haſt thou to doe with peace? turne thee behind mee?</hi> A ſecond is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed; with the ſame ſucceſſe: Both attend the traine of <hi>Iehu</hi> in ſtead of returning; Indeed, it is not for priuate perſons to hope to rectifie the publike affaires, when they are growne to an height of diſorder, and from thence to a ripeneſſe of miſ-cariage: Sooner may a well-meaning man hurt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3839:28"/>
himſelfe, then redreſſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon danger.</p>
                     <p>Theſe meſſengers were now within the mercy of a multitude, had they but indeuored to retire, they had periſhed as wilfully, as vainly: Whoſoeuer will be ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing againſt the torrent of a iuſt iudgment, muſt needs bee caried downe in the ſtreame: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is as much wiſdome in yeelding, as courage in reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                     <p>Had this troupe beene farre off, the watchman could not haue deſcryed the arriuall of the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, their turning behind, the manner of the march; <hi>Iehu</hi> was a noted Captaine, his cariage and motion was obſerued more full of fire, then his fellowes; <hi>The</hi>

                        <hi>driuing is like Iehues, for hee driueth furiouſly:</hi> God makes choyce of fit inſtruments, as of mercy, ſo of reuenge; Theſe ſpirits were needfull for ſo tragicall a ſcene, as was now preparing in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iehoram</hi> and <hi>Abaziah,</hi> as netled with this forced patience of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, can no longer keepe their ſeates; but will needs haſten their charets; and fetch that coſtly ſatisfaction, which would not be ſent, but giuen.</p>
                     <p>They are infatuated, which ſhall periſh; otherwiſe <hi>Iehoram</hi> had beene warned enough by the forceable retention of his meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to expect none but an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. A friend, or a ſubiect could not haue beene vnwilling to bee knowne, to be lookt for; Now;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3839:29"/>
forgetting his wounds, he will go to fetch death.</p>
                     <p>Yet when he ſees <hi>Iehu,</hi> whom he left a ſubiect, hopes ſtriue with his doubts, <hi>Is it peace, Iehu?</hi> what may be the reaſon of this ſudden iourney? Is the army foyled by the <hi>Syrians?</hi> Is <hi>Ramoth</hi> recouered? or hath the flight of the enemy left thee no further worke? or is ſome other ill newes guilty of thy haſt? What meanes this vnwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed preſence, and returne?</p>
                     <p>There needs no ſtay for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; The very face of <hi>Iehu,</hi> and thoſe ſparkling eyes of his ſpake fury, and death to <hi>Iehoram;</hi> which yet his tongue angerly ſeconds: <hi>What peace, ſo long as the whordomes of thy mother Iezebel, and her witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts are ſo many?</hi>
                     </p>

Wicked Tyran, what ſpeak'ſt thou of peace with men, when thou haſt thus long waged warre with the Almightie? That cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mother of thine hath nurſed thee with blood, and trained thee vp in abominable Idolatries.</p>
                     <p>Thou art not more hers, then her ſinne is thine; thou art pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with her ſpirituall whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and inchanted with her helliſh witchcrafts: Now that iuſt God whom thou, and thy parents haue ſo hainouſly deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſends thee by me this laſt meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his vengeance; which whiles hee ſpake, his hand is drawing vp that deadly arrow, which ſhall cure the former wounds with a worſe.</p>
                     <p>Too late now doth wretched

                     <p>That fatall ſhaft, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſwift pace of both the charets, is directed to the heart of <hi>Iehoram;</hi> there is no erring of thoſe feathers which are guided by the hand of deſtinie.</p>
                     <p>How iuſt are the iudgments of God! It was in the field of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both,</hi> wherein <hi>Iehoram</hi> met with <hi>Iehu;</hi> That very ground called to him for blood; And now this new auenger remembers that propheſie which he heard from the mouth of <hi>Elijah,</hi> in that very place, following the heeles of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab;</hi>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:3839:30"/>
and is carefull to performe it. Little did <hi>Iehu</hi> thinke, when he heard that meſſage of <hi>Elijah,</hi> that his hands ſhould act it; now, as zealous of accompliſhing the word of a Prophet; hee giues charge to <hi>Bidkar</hi> his Captaine, that the bleeding carkaſſe of <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> ſhould be caſt vpon that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry platt of <hi>Naboth:</hi> Oh <hi>Naboths</hi> blood well paid for! <hi>Ahabs</hi> blood is licked by dogs, in the very place where thoſe dogs lickt <hi>Naboths; Iehorams</hi> blood ſhall manure that ground, which was wrung from <hi>Naboth;</hi> and <hi>Iezebel</hi> ſhall adde to this compoſt.

                     <p>What a reſemblance there is betwixt the death of the father,

                     <p>It was time for <hi>Ahaziah</hi> King of <hi>Iuda,</hi> to flee: Nay it had beene time long before to haue fled from the ſins, yea from the houſe of <hi>Ahab;</hi> That brand is fearfull which God ſets vpon him; <hi>Hee</hi>

                     <p>What heed is to be taken of the deepe profeſſed ſeruices of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low harted followers; All this while they haue with humble ſmiles, and officious deuotions fawned vpon their great Queene; now vpon the call of a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enemy, they forget their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, her royalty; and caſt her downe, as willing executioners, into the iawes of a fearfull death:

It is hard for greatneſſe to know them whom it may truſt: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the faireſt ſemblance is from the falſeſt heart; It was a iuſt plague of God vpon wicked <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebel,</hi> that ſhee was inwardly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of her owne; He whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants ſhe perſecuted, raiſed vp e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to her from her owne elbow.</p>

                     <p>Nothing wanted now, but the ſacrifice: No doubt whole heards and flockes were ready for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſome royall hecatombs;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3839:47"/>
whereof ſome had now already ſmoked on their Altars. O <hi>Iehu</hi> what meanes this dilation? If thou abhorreſt <hi>Baal,</hi> why didſt thou giue way to this laſt ſacrifice? why didſt thou not cut off theſe Idolaters before this vpſhot of their wickedneſſe? Was it that thou mightſt be ſure of their guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe? was it that their number, together with their ſinne, might be complete? What acclamations were here to <hi>Baal,</hi> what ioy in the freedome of their reuiued worſhip: when all on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, thoſe that had ſacrificed, are ſacrificed; The Souldiers of <hi>Iehu</hi> by his appointment ruſh in with their ſwords drawne, and turne the temple into a ſlaughter-houſe. How is the tune now changed?
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3839:47"/>
What ſhrieking was here? what out-cries? what running from one ſword, to the edge of another? what ſcrambling vp the walls and pillars? what climbing into the windowes? what vaine ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors to eſcape that death which would not be ſhunned? whether running, or kneeling, or proſtrate, they muſt dye.</p>
                     <p>The firſt part of the ſacrifice was <hi>Baals,</hi> the latter is Gods: The blood of beaſts was offered in the one, of men in the other; the ſhedding of this was ſo much more acceptable to God, by how much theſe men were more beaſts, then thoſe they ſacrificed. Oh happy obedience; God was pleaſed with a ſacrifice from the houſe of <hi>Baal;</hi> The Idolaters are
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3839:48"/>
ſlaine, the Idols burnt, the houſe of <hi>Baal</hi> turn'd to a draught (tho euen thus leſſe vncleane, leſſe noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, then in the former per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes;) and in one word, <hi>Baal</hi> is deſtroyed out of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Who that had ſeene all this zeale for God, would not haue ſaid; <hi>Iehu</hi> is a true <hi>Iſraelite.</hi> Yet, he that roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out <hi>Ahab,</hi> would not be rid of <hi>Ieroboam:</hi> He that deſtroyed <hi>Baal,</hi> maintained the two Calues of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> That Idolatry was of a lower ranke; as being a miſ-worſhip of the true God, whereas the other was a worſhip of the falſe: Euen the eaſier of both is haynous; and ſhall robb <hi>Iehu</hi> of the praiſe of his vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>A falſe heart may laudably quit

it ſelfe of ſome one groſs ſin, &amp; in the meane time hugg ſome leſſer euill that may condemne it: As a man recouered of a Feuer, may dye of a Iaundis, or a Dropſie. We loſe the thanke of all, if wee wilfully fault in one.</p>
                     <p>It is an intire goodnes that God cares for: Perhaps (ſuch is the bounty of our God) a partiall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience may be rewarded with a temporall bleſſing; (as <hi>Iehues</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity to <hi>Ahab</hi> ſhal cary the crown to his ſeed for foure generations) but we can neuer haue any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable aſſurance of an eternall retribution, if our hearts &amp; wayes be not perfit with God.

All this could not poſſibly be done and continued without the priuity of many faithfull Prieſts &amp; Leuites; who were as carefull to keepe this counſell, as hopefull of the iſſue of it: It is not hard for many honeſt hearts to agree in a religious ſecreſie; Needs muſt thoſe lips bee ſhut, which God hath ſealed vp.</p>

                     <p>There was none of all theſe agents who did not hold the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe to bee his owne; Euery true ſubiect of Iudah was feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſſed in this ſeruice; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any of them, who was not ſecretly heart-burned all this while, with the hatefull go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of this Idolatrous Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranneſſe: And now this inward fire is glad to find a vent; How gladly do they addreſs themſelues to this welcome imployment?

That houſe, in the rearing whereof not the noyſe of an hammer might be heard, now admits of the claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of armour, and the ſecret murmurs of ſome military atchieuement: No circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces either of place, or calling, are ſo punctuall, as that publique ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity may not diſpenſe with their alteration.</p>
                     <p>All things are now ready for this ſolemnity: Each man reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3839:55"/>
to fixe vpon his owne foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and longs to ſee the face of their long-concealed Soueraigne; and vowes his blood to the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the common liberty, to the puniſhment of a cruell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder: Now <hi>Iehoiada</hi> brings forth vnto them the Kings Son, and preſents him to the Peeres, and people; Hardly can the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude containe it ſelfe from ſhou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out too ſoone: One ſees in his countenance the features of his Father, <hi>Ahaziah;</hi> another of his Grandfather, <hi>Iehoram;</hi> a third profeſſes to diſcerne in him ſome lines, and faſhion of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandfather <hi>Iehoſaphat;</hi> all find in his face the naturall impreſſions of Maieſty; and reade in it the hopes, yea the propheſies of their
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3839:55"/>
future happineſſe. Not with more ioy, then ſpeed, doth <hi>Iehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> accompliſh all the rites of the Coronation. Before that young King could know what was done to him, hee is anointed, crowned, preſented with the booke of the Law: Thoſe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were inſtructiue; and, no doubt, <hi>Iehoiada</hi> failed not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon them in due time, to that royall Pupill.</p>
                     <p>The Oyle, wherewith he was anointed, ſignified his deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that high ſeruice; and thoſe indowments from heauen that might inable him to ſo great a function.</p>
                     <p>The Crowne, wherewith he was adorned, ſignified that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and maieſty which ſhould
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3839:56"/>
both incourage, and attend his Princely cares.</p>
                     <p>The booke of the Teſtimony ſignified the diuine rules and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, whereto he muſt frame his heart and actions, in the weil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of that Crowne, in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouement of that oile.</p>
                     <p>Theſe three, the oile, the Crown the Teſtimonie, that is, inward powers, outward magnificence, true pietie and iuſtice make vp a perfect Prince; None of theſe may be wanting; If there be not a due calling of God, and abilities meet for that greatneſſe, the oile faileth: If there be not a Maieſticke grace and royaltie, that may command reuerence, the Crowne is miſſing; If there be not a carefull reſpect to the law of God, as the abſolute
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3839:56"/>
guide of all counſells, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, the Teſtimonie is neglected; all of them concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, make both King and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple happy.</p>
                     <p>Now, it is time for the people to clap their hands, and by their lowd acclamations to witneſſe their ioy; which muſt needs break forth with ſo much more force, by how much it was longer, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on feares and policy, ſuppreſſed.</p>
                     <p>The Court and the Temple were neere together; Howeuer it was with <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and the late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted Princes of <hi>Iudah,</hi> according to the common word, the neerer to the Church, the further from God; their religious predeceſſors held it the greateſt commodity of their houſe, that it neighboured
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3839:57"/>
vpon the houſe of God; From her palace might <hi>Athaliah</hi> eaſily heare the ioyfull ſhouts of the multitude, the lowd noiſe of the Trumpets; and as aſtoniſhed with this new tumult of publike gratulations, ſhe comes running into the Temple: Neuer had her foot trod vpon that holy paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till now that ſhe came to fetch a iuſt reuenge from that God whoſe worſhip ſhee had contemned.</p>
                     <p>It fell out well, that her ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den amazedneſſe called her forth, without the attendance of any ſtrong guard; whoſe ſide-taking might haue made that quarrell mutually bloody: Shee ſoone heares, and ſees what ſhee likes not; her eare meets with, God
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3839:57"/>
ſaue the King; her eye meets with the vnlooked for heyre of the Kingdome, ſitting on his throne, crowned, and robed, in the royall faſhion; guarded with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and ſouldiers, proclaimed by the Trumpeters, acclamed &amp; applauded by the people.</p>
                     <p>Who can ſay whether this ſight draue her more neer to frenzie, or death? How could it bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, when thoſe great ſpirits of hers, that had beene long vſed to an vncontrolled ſoueraigntie, find themſelues ſo inexpectedly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
                     <p>Shee now rends her cloathes, and cryes, Treaſon, treaſon, as if that voice of hers could ſtill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all hearts, all hands; as if one breath of hers were power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:3839:58"/>
enough to blow away all theſe new deſignes: Oh <hi>Athaliah,</hi> to whom doſt thou complaine thy ſelfe? they are thy iuſt execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners wherewith thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed; If it be treaſon to ſet vp the true heire of <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> thou appealeſt to thy Traitors. The treaſon was thine, theirs is iuſtice; The time is now come of thy reckoning for all the royall blood of <hi>Iudah,</hi> which thine ambition ſhed; wonder rather at the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this long forbearance, then the rigor of this execution.</p>
                     <p>There needs no formall ſeat of Iuſtice in ſo apparent offence, <hi>Iehoiada</hi> paſſes the ſentence of death vpon her; <hi>Haue her forth of the ranges; Let her not be ſlaine in the houſe of the Lord; and him that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth</hi>

                        <hi>her, kill with the ſword.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Had not this vſurpation beene palpable, <hi>Iehoiada</hi> would not haue preſumed to intermedle; Now being both the Prieſt of God, and Vnckle and Protector to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full King, he doth that, out of the neceſſity of the ſtate, which his infant Soueraigne (if hee could haue beene capable of thoſe thoughts) would haue deſired.</p>
                     <p>Violent hands are layd vpon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaliah,</hi> whom no doubt a proud and furious diſdaine of ſo quicke a charge, and of ſo rough an vſage made miſerably impatient; Now ſhe frownes, and cals, and ſhrieks and commands, and threatens, and reuiles, and intreats in vaine; and dyes with as much ill will from her ſelfe, as ſhe liued with
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3839:59"/>
the ill will of her repining ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</p>
                     <p>I ſee not any one man of all her late flatterers, that followes her, either for pitty, or reſcue; Euery man willingly giues her vp to iuſtice; Not one ſword is drawn in her defence; Not one eye la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments her. Such is the iſſue of a tyrannicall miſ-gouernment; that which is obeyed not without ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret hate, is loſt not without pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ioy.</p>
                     <p>How like is <hi>Athaliah</hi> to her mother <hi>Iezebel,</hi> as in conditions and carriage, ſo euen in death: Both killed violently, both killed vnder their owne walls; both ſlaine with Treaſon in their mouthes; both ſlaine in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of a changed gouernment:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3839:59"/>
One trod on by the horſes, the other ſlaine in the horſe-gate. Both paid their owne blood for the innocent blood of others.</p>
                     <p>How ſuddenly, how eaſily is Iudah reſtored to it ſelfe, after ſo long, and ſo fearfull a deprauati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; The people ſcarce beleeue their owne eyes, for the wonder of this happy change; neither know I whether they bee more ioyed in the ſight of their new King, thus ſtrangely preſerued, or in the ſight of <hi>Iehoiada,</hi> that had preſerued him.</p>
                     <p>No man can enuy the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the young King vnto him, by whoſe meanes hee liues and raignes: That holy man cares onely to improue his authority, to the common good: <hi>He makes a</hi>

                     <p>The Scepter of Iudah is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from a woman, to a child; but, a Child trained vp, and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored by <hi>Iehoiada;</hi> This minority ſo guided was not inferiour to the mature age of many predeceſſors.

The yong King giues order to the Prieſts, for the collection of large ſumms,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3839:61"/>
to the repayring of the breaches of Gods Houſe.

                     <p>The time was, when a great King ſent to <hi>Eliſha</hi> to know if he ſhould recouer; now the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as knowing that <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſhall not recouer (ſo had his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption ſpent him) comes to viſit the dying Prophet; &amp; when his teares would giue him leaue; breakes forth into a paſſionate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, <hi>O my father, my father, the chariot of Iſrael and the horſmen thereof.</hi> Yet the Calues of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> haue left ſome goodneſſe in <hi>Ioaſh:</hi> As the beſt man hath ſomething in him worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe; ſo the faultieſt hath ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing commendable.

                     <p>Viſitation of the ſicke is a duty required both by the law of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and of religion; Bodily infirmity is ſad, and comfortleſſe; and therefore needs the preſence, and counſell of friends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue it; Although, when wee draw the curtaines of thoſe that are eminently gracious, wee doe rather fetch (with <hi>Ioaſh)</hi> then

                     <p>What vſe there was of charets and horſemen in thoſe warres of the Ancient, all Hiſtories can tell vs: All the ſtrength of the battell ſtood in theſe: There could bee neither defence, nor offence, but by them: ſuch was <hi>Eliſha</hi> vnto <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi> The greateſt ſafegard to any nation is the ſanctity, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of their Prophets; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <p>Had thine hand anſwered thy tongue, <hi>Iſrael</hi> had been happy in <hi>Eliſha; Eliſha</hi> had beene happy in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and thee; Words are no good tryall of profeſſion: The worſt men may ſpeake well: Actions haue onely the power to deſcry hypocrites.</p>
                     <p>Yet euen a <hi>Ioaſh</hi> thus complying, ſhall not goe away vnbleſſed: This outward kindneſſe ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue an outward retribution; Theſe few drops of warme wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhed vpon the face of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſhall not loſe their reward; The ſpirit of propheſie forſakes not the death-bed of <hi>Eliſha;</hi> Hee calls for bow, and arrowes, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3839:69"/>
puts them into the hand of <hi>Ioaſh,</hi> and putting his hands vpon the Kings hand, hee bids to ſhoot Eaſtward: and whiles the ſhaft flyes, and lights, he ſayes, <hi>The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the Lords deliuerance from Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria; for thou ſhalt ſmite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou haue conſumed them:</hi> If the weake and withered hand of the Prophet had not beene vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the youthfull, and vigorous hand of the King, this bow had been drawn in vaine; the ſtrength was from the hand of the King, the bleſſing from the hand of the Prophet: He whoſe reall parable hath made the earth to be <hi>Syria,</hi> the arrow, reuenge, the archer, <hi>Ioash,</hi> hath obtained for his laſt boone from God to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that this archer ſhall ſhoot this arrow
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3839:69"/>
of reuenge, into the heart of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and wound it to death. When the hand of the King, and of the Prophet drawes together, there cannot chooſe but ſucceſſe muſt follow.</p>
                     <p>How readily doth <hi>Eliſha</hi> now make good the words of <hi>Ioaſh?</hi> How truly is he the Charets, and Horſemen of <hi>Iſrael? Iſrael</hi> had not fought without him, much leſſe had been victorious; If theirs be the indeuour, the ſucceſſe is his: Euen the dying Prophet puts life, and ſpeed into the Forces of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and whiles hee is digging his owne graue, is raiſing Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phees to Gods people.</p>
                     <p>Hee had receiued kindneſſe from the <hi>Syrians;</hi> amongſt them was hee harbour'd in the dearth;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3839:70"/>
and from ſome of their Nobles, was preſented with rich gifts; but their enmity to <hi>Iſrael</hi> drowns all his priuate reſpects; he cannot but profeſſe hoſtility to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique enemies of the Church: Neither can he content himſelfe with a ſingle prediction of their ruine. Hee bids <hi>Ioaſh</hi> to take the arrowes, and ſmite vpon the ground; hee ſets no number of thoſe ſtrokes; as ſuppoſing the freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of thoſe blowes, which <hi>Ioaſh</hi> might well (vpon his former parabolicall act) vnderſtand to bee ſignificant. The ſlacke hand of the King ſmites but thriſe. So apt we are to be wanting to our ſelues; ſo coldly doe wee execute the commands of God: The ſick Prophet is not more greeued,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3839:70"/>
then angry at this dull negligence; Doubtleſſe God had reuealed to him (for his laſt gratification) that vpon his feruent prayers, ſo oft as <hi>Ioash</hi> ſhould voluntarily (after his generall charge) ſmite the earth, ſo oft ſhould <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſmite <hi>Syria. Eliſhaes</hi> zeale doth not lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh with his body: with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly authoritie hee chides him, who had ſtyled him father; not fearing to ſpend ſome of his laſt winde in a myld reproofe, <hi>Thou ſhouldſt haue ſmitten fiue or ſix times, then thou hadſt ſmitten Syria till thou hadſt conſumed it, whereas now thou ſhalt ſmite Syria but thriſe.</hi> Not that the vnchangeable decree of the Almighty meant to ſuſpend it ſelfe vpon the vncertaine iſſue of <hi>Ioaſhes</hi> will; but, hee that put this
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3839:71"/>
word into the mouth of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, puts this motion into the hand of the King, which did not more willingly ſtay, then neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily obey that prouidence wherby it was ſtirred.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Eliſha</hi> dyes, and is buried; his miracles doe not ceaſe with his life: Who can maruell that his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing prayers raiſed the ſonne of the <hi>Shunamite,</hi> when his dead bones raiſe the carkaſſe that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched them.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3839:71"/>
yet ſhall reuiue another; the ſame power might haue continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life to him, that gaue it by his bones. <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall well ſee that he liues, by whoſe vertue, <hi>Eliſha</hi> was both in life, and death, miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: Whiles the Prophet was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, the impetration might ſeeme to be his, though the power were Gods; now that he is dead, the bones can challenge nothing, but ſend the wondring <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to that almighty Agent, to whom it is all one to worke by the quicke, or dead. Were not the men of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> more dead then the carkaſſe thus buryed, how could they chooſe but ſee in this reuiued corps, an embleme of their owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition? how could they chooſe but thinke, If wee adhere to the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3839:72"/>
God of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> he ſhall raiſe our decayed eſtates, and reſtore our nation to the former glory.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sadduces</hi> had as yet no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with what face could that hereſie euer after looke into the world, when before the birth of it, it was ſo palpably conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, with an example of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection? Intermiſſion of time, and degrees of corruption adde nothing to the impoſſibilitie of our riſing: The body that is once cold in death, hath no more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to a reanimation, then that which is moldred into duſt; One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the diuine power of the Maker muſt reſtore eyther, can reſtore both: When wee are dead, and buryed in the graue of our ſinne; it is only the touch of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3839:72"/>
applying vnto vs the death and reſurrection of the Sonne of God, that can put new life into vs; No leſſe true, though ſpirituall, is the miracle of our raiſing vp from an eſtate of inward corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to a life of grace.</p>

There is no place wherein I could be ſory to ſee thee, ô King, but this, where thou art; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any act, that wee ſhould grudge thee ſo much, as this, which is the moſt ſacred; Is it poſſible that ſo great an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight ſhould fall into ſuch wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?

But if it bee thy zeale of a perſonall ſeruice to God, that hath caried thee hither; alas, how canſt thou hope to pleaſe the Almighty with a forbidden ſacrifice? Which of thine holy Progenitors euer dared to tread, where thy foot now ſtandeth? which of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer put forth their hand to touch this ſacred Altar?
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:3839:79"/>
Thou knoweſt that God hath ſet apart, and ſanctified his owne at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants; wherefore ſerues the Prieſthood, if this be the right of Kings? Were it not for the ſtrict prohibition of our God, it could ſeeme no other then an honour to our profeſſion, that a King ſhould thinke to dignifie himſelfe by our employment; but now, knowing the ſeuere charge of the great King of heauen, wee cannot but tremble to ſee that cenſer in thine hand; who euer, out of the holy Tribe, hath weil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it vnreuenged? This affront is not to vs, it is to the God who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſerue; In awe of that terrible Maieſty, as thou wouldſt auoid ſome exemplary iudgement, O King, withdraw thy ſelfe, not

without humble deprecations, from this preſence; and lay down that interdicted handfull, with feare and trembling; Bee thou euer a King, let vs bee Prieſts; The Scepter is thine, let Cenſers be ours.</p>
                     <p>What religious heart could do other then relent at ſo faithfull and iuſt an admonition? But how hard it is for great perſons to yeeld they haue offended? <hi>Vzziah</hi> muſt not be faulty; what is done raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall be born out with power; He was wroth; and thus expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it: What meanes this ſaucy expoſtulation, O ye ſons of <hi>Leui?</hi> how dare ye thus malapertly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll the well-meant actions of your Soueraigne? If ye be Prieſts, remember that ye are ſubiects; or
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3839:80"/>
if ye will needs forget it, how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is it for this hand to awake your memory? What ſuch offence can it be for me to come into that houſe, and to touch that Altar, which my royall Progenitors haue made, beautified, conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Is the God of this place only yours? Why doe ye thus ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ingroſſe Religion? If Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue not intermedled with theſe holy affaires, it was becauſe they would not, not becauſe they might not; When thoſe lawes were made for the Sanctuary, there were no Kings to grace theſe diuine ceremonies; yet euen then, <hi>Moſes</hi> was priuiledged: The perſons of Princes (if yee know not) are no leſſe ſacred then your owne. It is your preſumption to

account the Lords anointed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane: Conteſt with thoſe, whoſe dry &amp; vnhallowed heads are ſubiect to your power; For me, I will not aske your leaue to bee deuout; Looke yee to your owne Cenſers, preſume not to meddle with mine; In the meane time, can ye thinke this inſolence of yours ſhall eſcape vnreuenged? Can it ſtand with the honour of my ſoueraignty, to be thus proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly checked by ſubiects? God doe ſo to me and more alſo, if. Whiles <hi>Vzziah</hi> yet ſpeakes, God ſtrikes: Ere the words of fury can come forth of his mouth, the leproſie appeares in his forhead: Leproſie was a moſt loathſome diſeaſe; the forhead is the moſt conſpicuous part: Had this ſhamefull ſcurfe
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:3839:81"/>
broken forth vpon his hand, or foot, or breſt, it might haue been hid from the eyes of men; now the forhead is ſmitten with this iudgement, that God may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime to all beholders, Thus ſhal it be done to the man whoſe arrogance hath thruſt him vpon a ſacred charge. Publique offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces muſt haue open ſhame.</p>
                     <p>It is a dangerous thing to put our ſelues into the affaires, into the preſence of God, vnwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; There cannot be a more foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh meſpriſion, then, becauſe we are great on earth, to thinke wee may be bold with heauen: When Gods meſſengers cannot preuaile by counſels, intreaties, threats, it is time for God to ſhow his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate iudgements. Wilfull offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3839:82"/>
can expect nothing but a fearfull reuenge.</p>
                     <p>Now begins <hi>Vzziah</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in himſelfe; and ſhame ſtriues with leproſie, for a place in his forehead; The hand of God hath done that in an inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which all the to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues of men had attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in vaine: There needs no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſolicitor of his egreſſe, the ſenſe of his plague ſends him forth alone: And now he thinks; Wretched man that I am, how haue I angred God, and vndone my ſelfe? I would needs come in like a Prieſt, I now goe forth a leper: the pride of my hart made me thinke my ſelfe worthy the preſence of a God; Gods iuſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure hath now made me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the preſence of men:
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3839:82"/>
whiles I affected the altar, I haue loſt my throne; whiles I ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reiected the aduice and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Gods miniſters, I am now becomne a ſpectacle of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and deformity, to my owne ſeruants; I that would be ſending vp perfumes to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haue made my naſtineſſe hatefull to my own ſenſes. What doe I vnder this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred roofe? Neither is Gods houſe now, for mee, nor mine owne; what cell, what dungeon is cloſe enough for me, wherin to weare out the reſidue of mine vnhappy and vncomfortable dayes? O God thou art iuſt, and I am miſerable.</p>
                     <p>Thus with a deiected counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and ſad heart, doth <hi>Vzziah</hi> haſt to retire himſelfe; &amp; wiſhes, that he could be no leſſe hid from

himſelfe, then from others: how eaſie is it for the God of heauen to bring downe the hyeſt pitch of earthly greatneſſe, and to humble the ſtubborneſt pride?</p>
                     <p>Vpon the leaſure of ſecond thoughts, <hi>Vzziah</hi> cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge much fauour in this correction, and confeſſe to haue eſcaped well; Others, hee knew, had beene ſtrucke dead, or ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd vp quick for ſo preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an intruſion: It is happy for him if his forehad may excuſe his ſoule.</p>

hee was obeyed.

accordingly; The fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God is wiſer then the wiſedome of men; Idolatry and falſhood is commonly more gawdy and plauſible, then truth; That hart which can for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward homelineſſe deſpiſe the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, is already alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from true religion, and lyes open to the groſſeſt ſuperſtition.</p>
                     <p>Neuer any Prince was ſo foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly idolatrous, at that he wanted a Prieſt to ſecond him: An <hi>Vrijah</hi> is fit to humor an <hi>Ahaz.</hi> Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe neuer could command any thing, which ſome ſeruile wits were not ready both to applaud, and iuſtifie.</p>

                     <p>Fourteene years had good <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> fed vpon a ſweet peace, ſauced only with a ſet penſion; now he muſt prepare his pallat for the bitter morſels of warre.

                     <p>How ſpeedy an execution was this, how miraculous? No humane arme ſhall haue the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this victory; It was God that

to ſay to a King, <hi>Thou ſhalt dye, and not liue:</hi> I doe not heare <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> rage, &amp; fret at the meſſage; or threat the bearer, but he meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turnes his face to the wall, and weepes, and prayes: Why to the wall?

                     <p>Couldſt thou feare, ô <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> that God had forgotten thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity?

Farre, farre were theſe preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous conceits from that humble and mortified ſoule: Thou hadſt hated thine owne breſt, if it could once haue harboured ſo proud a thought.

the ſweetneſſe of life, of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of diſſolution; Both theſe were in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> neither of them could tranſport him into this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: they were higher reſpects that ſwayed with ſo holy a Prince; a tender care of the glory of God, a carefull pitty of the Church of God; His very teares ſaid; ô God, thou knoweſt that the eyes of the world are bent vpon me, as one that hath abandoned their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and reſtored thy ſincere wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; I ſtand alone in the midſt of a wicked and idolatrous genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that lookes thorough all my actions, all my euents; If now they ſhall ſee me ſnatcht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the midſt of my dayes, what will theſe Heathen ſay; how can thy great name but ſuffer in

Death comes to ſwallow vp his perſon, (and that not without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) prayers and teares ſend him away diſappointed. Before <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was gone out into the midle Court, the word of the Lord came to him, ſaying; <hi>Turne againe, and tell Hezekiah the Captaine of my people; Thus ſaith the Lord, the God of Dauid thy father; I haue heard thy prayer, I haue ſeene thy teares; behold I will heale thee; On the third day thou ſhalt goe vp to the houſe of the Lord; and I will adde to thy dayes fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What ſhall we ſay then, ô God, haſt thou thus ſoone changed thy purpoſe? Was it not thy true meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage which thy Prophet, euen now, deliuered to <hi>Ezekiah?</hi> Is ſome what falne out that thou

fore-ſawſt not? or, doeſt thou now decree ſomewhat thou meantſt not? The very thought of any of theſe were no better then blaſphemous impiety. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> could not liue one day longer, then was eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decreed; The decree of Gods eternall counſell had from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, determined him fifteene yeeres yet longer: Why then doth God ſay, by his Prophet, <hi>Thou ſhalt dye, and not liue?</hi> He is not as man that he ſhould repent; the meſſage is changed, the will is not changed; yea rather the meſſage is explicated, not changed; For the ſignified will of God, though it ſound abſolutely, yet muſt bee vnderſtood with condition; that tells <hi>Hezekiah</hi> what hee muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:3839:119"/>
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nature of his diſeaſe, what would befall him, without his deprecations: There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but death in the ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; what euer ſecret purpoſe there was in the firſt; and that purpoſe ſhall lye hid for a time, vnder a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued condition: The ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree that ſayes, <hi>Niniue</hi> ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, meanes, if <hi>Niniue</hi> repent, it ſhall not be deſtroyed; hee that finds good reaſon to ſay, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſhall dye, yet ſtill meanes, if the quickned deuotion of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſhall importune mee for life, it ſhall be protracted. And the ſame God that hath decreed this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fifteene years, had decreed to ſtirre vp the ſpirit of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to that vehement and weeping importunity, which ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

it. O God, thou workeſt thy good pleaſure in vs, and with vs; and by thy reuealed will mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt vs in thoſe wayes, whereby thou effecteſt thy ſecret will.</p>
                     <p>How wonderfull is this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> teares are not dry vpon his cheekes, yea his breath is not paſſed his lips, when God ſends him a comfortable anſwer.

                     <p>To that man after his owne heart, had God ingaged himſelfe, by his gracious promiſe, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue his throne, his ſeed: God loues to remember his ancient mercies: How happy a thing it is to be faithfull with God; this is the way to oblige thoſe which are yet vnborne; and to intayle bleſſings vpon the ſucceſſions of future generations.</p>
                     <p>It ſeemes it was ſome peſtilent vlcer that thus indangered the life of <hi>Hezekiah. Iſaiah</hi> is not a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

                     <p>The ſudden contradiction of the meſſage cauſes a iuſt difficulty in the aſſent. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> therefore craues a ſigne; not for that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted, but that hee might truſt the more; wee can neuer take too faſt hold of thoſe promiſes of God, which haue not more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the application, then natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall impoſſibility in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.

                     <p>The ſicke King hath his opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; His father was offred a ſigne and refuſed it; hee ſues for one, and obtaines it: <hi>Shall the ſhadow goe for ward ten degrees, or backe ten degrees?</hi> As if heauen it ſelfe lay

at the meaſure of the loue of God to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> or at the power of <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> faith in God? Out of both, either the Sun goes backe in heauen that his ſhadow may goe backe on earth: or the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow no leſſe miraculouſly goes backe on earth, whiles the Sunne goes forward in heauen. It is true that the Prophet ſpeakes of the ſhadow, not of the Sun; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept perhaps becauſe the motion of the Sun is beſt diſcerned by the ſhadow; and the motion of the ſhadow is led by the courſe of the Sunne: beſides, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of this miracle is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be locall in the Diall of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> not vniuerſall, in the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble length of the day; withall, the retrait of the Sunne had made a

publike and noted change in the frame of nature, this particular al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the ſhadow in places limited, might ſatisfie no leſſe without a confuſiue mutation in the face of the world; Whetherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer; to draw the Sun backe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſhadow; or to draw the ſhadow backe without the Sunne was the proofe of a diuine omnipotency; able therefore to draw backe the life of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> fifteene degrees, from the night of death; towards which it was haſting.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chaldees</hi> were curious ſearchers into the ſecrets of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eſpecially into the motions of the celeſtiall bodies; Though there had beene no politicke rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

this very Aſtronomicall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle had beene enough to fetch them to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that they might ſee the man, for whoſe ſake the Sun forſooke his place, or the ſhadow forſooke the Sun.</p>
                     <p>How eaſily haue we ſeene thoſe holy men miſ-caried by proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, againſt whom no miſeries could preuaile?

                     <p>The <hi>Babylonian</hi> Ambaſſadors are too welcome to <hi>Ezekiah;</hi> As a man tranſported with the honor of their reſpectiue, and coſtly viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:3839:125"/>
he forgets his teares, and his turning to the wall; he forgets their incompatible Idolatry; ſo hugging them in his boſome, as if there had beene no cauſe of ſtrangeneſſe: All his doores fly open to them; and in a vainglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious oſtentation all his new-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered treaſures, all his ſtrong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moryes entertaine their eyes; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his houſe, nothing in his Dominion is hid from them.</p>
                     <p>Oh <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> what meanes this impotent ambition? It is not long ſince thou tareſt off the very plates of the Temple doores, to giue vnto <hi>Senacherib;</hi> and can thy treaſures be ſuddenly ſo multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they can be worthy to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh forraine beholders? Or, if thy ſtore-houſe were as rich as

the earth, can thy heart be ſo vain as to be lifted vp with theſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie metals? Didſt thou not ſee that heauen it ſelfe was at thy becke, whileſt thou wert hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled? and ſhall a little earthlie droſſe haue power ouer thy ſoul?

Oh God, if thou do not keepe vs, as well in our ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, as in our ſtorme, wee are ſure to periſh: As in all time of our tribulation, ſo in all time of our wealth, good Lord deliuer vs.</p>

                     <p>The great and holy God will not digeſt pride in any, much leſſe, in his owne.

                     <p>Theſe worldly things are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt off from the heart; Perhaps <hi>Hezekiah</hi> might not bee much troubled with their loſſe: Loe, God comes cloſer to him, yet.</p>

                     <p>This rod was ſmart, yet good <hi>Ezekiah</hi> kiſſes it; his heart ſtrucke him no leſſe, then the mouth of the Prophet; meekly therefore doth he yeeld to this diuine cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord which thou haſt ſpoken.</hi> Thou haſt ſpoken this word, but from the Lord; it is not thine, but his; and being his, it muſt needs bee, like himſelfe, good: Good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is iuſt, for I haue deſerued more, and worſe; Good, becauſe mercifull; for I ſuffer not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my deſerts. <hi>Is it not good, if there be peace and truth in my daies?</hi> I haue deſerued a preſent payme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, O God thou deferreſt it; I haue deſerued it in perſon, thou reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt it for thoſe whom I cannot

                     <p>Still in the throne of <hi>Iudah</hi> there is a ſucceſſion, and interchange of good and euill: Good <hi>Iotham</hi> is ſucceeded by wicked <hi>Ahaz;</hi> wicked <hi>Ahaz</hi> is ſucceed by good <hi>Ezekiah;</hi> Good <hi>Ezekiah</hi> is ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by wicked <hi>Manaſſeh:</hi> Euill Princes ſucceed to good, for the

                     <p>The young yeares of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> giue aduantage to his miſ-cariage; Euen, whiles he might haue been vnder the Ferule, hee ſwayed the Scepter: Whither may not a child be drawne, eſpecially to a gariſh, and puppet-like ſuperſtition?

                     <p>I feare to looke at the out-rages of this wicked ſonne of <hi>Ezekiah:</hi> What hauocke doth hee make in the Church of God? as if hee had beene borne to ruine Religion, as if his onely felicity had beene to vntwiſt, or teare, in one day, that holy web which his father had beene weauing, nine and twenty yeares? and contrarily, to ſet vp in one houre that offenſiue pile,

Lo, here was Idolatrie in the height, viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods houſe, ſorceries of all kinds, bloodie crueltie to his owne fleſh, to the Saints of God; and all theſe againſt the ſtreame of a religious inſtitution, of the zealous counſels of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,

                     <p>Who can complaine that the way of heauen is blocked vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, when hee ſees ſuch a ſinner enter? Say the worſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy ſelfe, ô thou clamorous foule; Here is one that murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, defied God, worſhipt Diuels; and yet finds the way to repentance; if thou bee worſe then he, deny (if thou canſt) that to thy ſelfe, which God hath not denied to thee, capacitie of grace: In the meane time; know that it is not thy ſinne, but thine impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence that barres heauen againſt thee.</p>

His cuſtome of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs hath obdur'd his hart, &amp; made it flint to all good impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.

                     <p>The Almighty wil be ſure to be knowne for what he is: if not by faire meanes, yet by foule; If our proſperity, and peace, and ſweet experience of his mercy can win vs to acknowledge him, it is more for our eaſe, but, if we will needes bee taught by ſtripes, it is

                     <p>There is nothing but hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie in that penitent, who after all vowes, and teares, retaines his old abhominations; It is that poore peece of ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we can giue to the diuine iuſtice, in an hearty indignation, to fling downe that cup of wickedneſſe wherewith wee haue beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, and to trample vpon the

                     <p>The liuing God loues to dwell cleane, hee will not come vnder the roofe of Idols, nor admit I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols to come vnder his: Firſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> caſts out the ſtrange Gods and Idols, and altars; and then, <hi>He repaires the Altar of the Lord, and ſacrifices thereon peace-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and thanke-offerings.</hi> Not, till he had pull'd down, might he build; and when hee had pull'd downe, hee muſt build: True repentance is no leſſe actiue of good. What is it the better, if when the Idolatrous altars are defaced, the true God hath not an Altar erected to his Name? In many Altars was ſuperſtition,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:3839:141"/>
in no altars, Atheiſme.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth penitent <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> build God a new Altar, but hee repaires the old, which by long diſ-vſe lay waſt, and was moſſie &amp; mouldred with age &amp; neglect.</p>
                     <p>God loues well his owne inſtitutions; neither can he abide innouations, ſo much as in the out-ſides of his ſeruices. It is an happy worke to vindicate any ordinance of God from the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of times, and to reſtore it to the originall glory.</p>
                     <p>What haue our pious gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors done other in religion? had wee gone about to lay a new foundation, the worke had been accurſed; now wee haue onely ſcraped off ſome ſuperfluous moſſe, that was growne vpon
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:3839:142"/>
theſe holy ſtones, we haue cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome broken peeces, we haue pointed ſome crazie corners with wholſome morter, in ſtead of baſe clay, wherewith it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully patched vp: The altar is old, it is Gods altar: It is not new, not ours: If we haue layd one new ſtone in this ſacred buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, let it flye in our faces, and beat out our eyes.</p>
                     <p>On this repaired altar doth <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſseh</hi> ſend vp the ſacrifices of his peace, of his thankfulneſſe; and doubtleſſe the God of heauen ſmels a ſweet ſauour of reſt; No perfume is ſo pleaſing to God, as that which is caſt in by a penitent hand.</p>
                     <p>It had not ſerued the turne that <hi>Manaſseh</hi> had approched alone to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:3839:142"/>
this renued altar; As his leud ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample had withdrawn the people from their God; ſo now <hi>he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Iudah to ſerue the Lord God of Iſrael;</hi> Had he been ſilent, he could not haue been vnfollowed: Euery act of greatneſſe is preceptiue; but now that religion is made Law, what <hi>Iſraelite</hi> will not be deuout?</p>
                     <p>The true God hath now no competitour in <hi>Iudah;</hi> All the Idolls are pull'd downe, the high places will not be pull'd downe; An ill guiſe is eaſilie taken vp, it is not ſo eaſily left. After a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon deprauation of religion, it is hard to returne vnto the firſt purity: as when a garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoiled, it cannot without many lauers recouer the former clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

of this holy place: The very pile began to complaine of age and vnreſpect: Now comes good <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> and in his eighteenth yeare (when other young Gallants would haue thought of nothing but pleaſure, and iollity) takes vp the lateſt care of his father <hi>Dauid,</hi> and giues order for the repayring of the Temple.</p>
                     <p>The keepers of the doore haue receiued the contribution of all faithfull Iewes, for this pious vſe; the King ſends <hi>Shaphan</hi> the ſcribe to <hi>Hilkijah</hi> the Prieſt to ſumme it vp, and to deliuer it vnto Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, and Maſons, for ſo holy a worke.</p>

The command is the Kings, the charge is the high-Prieſts, the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is the workmens; when the laborers are faithfull in doing the worke, and the high Prieſt in directing it, and the King in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioining it, Gods Houſe cannot faile of an happy perfection; but when any of theſe ſlackens, the buſineſſe muſt needs languiſh.</p>
                     <p>How God bleſſes the deuout indeuours of his ſeruants? Whiles <hi>Hilkijah</hi> was diligently ſuruaying the breaches and the reparation of the Temple, hee lights vpon the booke of the Law: The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticke and originall Booke of <note place="margin">Deut. 31. 26.</note> Gods Law was by a ſpeciall charge appointed to be carefully kept within a ſafe ſhrine, in the

Sanctuary: In the depraued times of idolatry, ſome faithfull Prieſt (to make ſure worke) had locked it faſt vp, in ſome ſecret corner of the Temple, from the reach of all hands, of all eyes: as knowing how impoſſible it was, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine monument could otherwiſe eſcape the fury of prophane guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe: Some few tranſcripts there were doubtleſſe, (parcels of this ſacred Book) in other hands; neither doubt I, but as <hi>Hilkijah</hi> had been formerly well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this holy volume (now of long time hid) ſo the eares of good <hi>Ioſiah</hi> had beene inured to ſome paſſages thereof; but the whole body of theſe awfull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, ſince the late night of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous confuſion, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

ſaw no light, till now; This precious treaſure doth <hi>Hilkijah</hi> find, whiles he digs for the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Neuer man laboured to the reparation of Gods Church, but he met with a bleſſing more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he looked for.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hilkijah</hi> the Prieſt, and <hi>Shaphan</hi> the ſcribe do not ingroſſe this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable wealth into their owne hands, nor ſuppreſſe theſe more then ſacred roles, for their owne aduantage; but tranſ-mit them, firſt to the eares of the King, then by him, to the people: It is not the praiſe of a good ſcribe, to lay vp, but to bring forth, both old and new: And if the Prieſts lips ſhall keepe knowledge, they keep it to impart, not to ſmother: <hi>The people ſhall ſeeke the Law at his</hi>
                        <pb n="285" facs="tcp:3839:147"/>

                     <p>So ſoone as the good King heares the words of the booke of the Law, and in ſpeciall, thoſe dreadfull threats of iudgement, denounced againſt the Idolatries of his <hi>Iudah;</hi> he rends his clothes, to ſhow his heart rent with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and fearfull expectation of thoſe plagues; and waſhes his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome with teares.

The very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:3839:148"/>
of this Law doth thus affect him; the preaching of it ſtirs not vs; The ſinnes of others ſtrucke thus deepe with him; our owne are ſleighted by vs: A ſoft hart is the beſt tempered for God: So Phyſitians are wont to like thoſe bodies beſt, which are eaſieſt to worke vpon: O God make our clay, waxe, and our waxe pliable to thine hand; ſo ſhall we be ſure to be free either from ſin, or from the hurt of ſin.</p>
                     <p>It is no holy ſorrow that ſends vs not to God; <hi>Ioſiah</hi> is not moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with a diſtractiue griefe, or an aſtoniſhing feare, but in the height of his paſſion, ſends fiue choice meſſengers to <hi>Huldah</hi> the Propheteſſe, to enquire of the Lord, for himſelfe, for <hi>Iudah:</hi> It is
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:3839:148"/>
an happie trouble that driues vs to this refuge. I doe not heare any of theſe Courtiers reply to this godly motion of their young King: Alas, Sir, what meanes this deepe perplexity?

the obſtinate; had we beene ſtill guilty, theſe feares had been iuſt: were wee ſtill in danger, what had we gained by our conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Rather, as glad to ſecond the religious cares of their young King, they feed his holy anxieties with a iuſt aggrauation of perill; and by their good counſell, whet theſe his zealous deſires of a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reſolution: That ſtate cannot but be happy, whoſe Prieſts and Peeres are ready as to ſuggeſt, ſo to cheriſh, and execute the deuout proiects of their Soueraignes.</p>

As <hi>Ioſiah</hi> and his meſſengers do not deſpiſe <hi>Huldah,</hi> becauſe ſhee was a woman; ſo <hi>Huldah</hi> doth not flatter <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> becauſe a King: <hi>Goe tell the man that ſent you; Thus ſaith the Lord: Behold I will bring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill vpon this place.</hi> Loe, hee that was as God to his ſubiects, is but as a man to the Propheteſſe: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the meſſage euer the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe it is required by a Prince: No circumſtance may vary the forme of diuine truth.</p>
                     <p>Euill muſt befall <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> yea, all the words of that booke, muſt allight vpon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of both: In how bad a caſe we may bee, and yet thinke our ſelues not ſafe onely, but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py?

This Propheteſſe had immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate viſions from God, yet ſhee muſt ſpeake out of the Booke; There was neuer any reuelation from the Lord, that croſſed his writings: His hand, and his tongue agree eternally: If that booke haue curſed <hi>Iudah,</hi> ſhe may not abſolue it.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And now is the houre come, wherein euerie of thoſe words ſhall bee accompliſhed: It could not but bee a great confirmation to <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> to ſee that God had ſo

long agoe fore-markt him for his owne; and fore-nam'd him to ſo zealous a ſeruice.</p>
                     <p>All our names are equally fore-known of that diuine prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, though not fore-ſpoken: neither can any act paſſe from vs, which was not pre-determined in that eternall Counſell of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: neither can any act that is there pre-determined bee vnful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled vpon earth: Interuention of time breakes no ſquare in the diuine decrees: Our pur-blind eies ſee nothing, but that which toucheth their lidds; the quicke ſight of Gods preſcience ſees that, as preſent, which is a world off: According to the prediction, the ſtench of dead mens bones is a fit perfume to ſend vp from this

altar to heauen; whoſe beſt ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices ſauoured worſe in the noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrils of God.

                     <p>Euen that Prophet who fore-told this, had his toomb in <hi>Bethel,</hi> and that toomb had his inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; His laſt weakeneſſe might not rob him of the honour of his ſepulture: How palpablie doe theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> condemne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, whiles they reſerue ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a monument of their own conviction. It was no preiudice to this holy Prophet, that his bones lay amongſt the ſepulchers of idolaters. His Epitaph preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:3839:155"/>
thoſe bones from burning, vpon that altar, which he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed; As the Lyon might not teare his carcaſſe, when hee died, ſo now, the furie of the multitude may not violate his verie bones, in the graue.</p>

to inquire of a Propheteſſe; now, vpon theſe particular threats of danger to himſelfe, ſpeaks not, ſtirs not. The famous Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> was then liuing, and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaniah;</hi> beſides a whole Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Seers, <hi>Ioſiah</hi> doth not ſo much as ſend out of doores, to aske, <hi>Shall I goe vp againſt the King of Egipt?</hi> Sometimes, both grace and wit are aſleepe in the holieſt and warieſt breſts: The beſt of all Gods Saints may bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times miſcaried by their paſſions, to their coſt.</p>

                     <p>Needs will <hi>Ioſiah</hi> put himſelfe into armes againſt an vnwilling enemie; and, to bee leſſe noted, diſguiſes himſelfe.

                     <p>How happily hath <hi>Ioſiah</hi> gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by this change?

                     <p>Doubtleſſe, it did not a little moue <hi>Cyrus</hi> to this fauour, that he found himſelfe honorably fore-named in theſe Iewiſh prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and fore appointed to this glorious ſeruice, no leſſe then an hundred and ſeuenty yeares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Eſay 44 vlt</note> he was: Who would not be glad to make good ſo noble and happy a deſtiny?

                     <p>In the firſt yeare of his Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, doth <hi>Cyrus</hi> both make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, and publiſh them in writing, through all his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:3839:169"/>
wherein he both profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his zealous reſolutions, and deſires to build vp Gods houſe, in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and inioynes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages all the Iewes, through his dominions, to addreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to that ſacred worke; and incites all his ſubiects to ayd them with ſiluer, and gold, and goods, and beaſts. How gracious was the command of that, whereof the very allowance was a fauour?</p>
                     <p>Was it <hi>Cyrus</hi> that did this? was it not thou, O God, in whoſe hands are the harts of Kings, that ſtirredſt vp the ſpirit of this <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> as if he had beene more then a ſonne of thy Church, a father?

But the Princely hart of <hi>Cyrus</hi> would admit of no ſuch baſe ſacrilegious thoughts; Thoſe veſſels that hee

Cymbals, interchanging their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Muſicke, and melodiouſly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging praiſes to the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had turned their captiuity as the ſtreames in the South, and honoured their eyes and hands with the firſt ſtones of his houſe: The people ſecond their ſongs with ſhouts; The earth ſounds, and heauen rings with the ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acclamations of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; It is no ſmall comfort, in a good action, to haue begun wel; The entrance of any holy enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe is commonly encountred with many diſcouragements, which if wee haue once ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, the paſſage is ſmooth.</p>
                     <p>How would theſe men haue ſhouted at the laying on of the laſt ſtone of the battlements, who are
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:3839:174"/>
thus ioyed with laying the firſt ſtones of the foundation? The end of any thing is better then the beginning: that hath certainty, this danger; this labour, that reſt: little did theſe men thinke that, for all this, few of them ſhould liue to ſee the roofe.</p>
                     <p>What different affections ſhall wee ſee produced in men by the ſame occaſion? The younger <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhouted at this ſight, the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wept: The yonger ſhouted to ſee a new foundation; The elder wept to remember the old: They who had ſeene no better, thought this goodly; They who had ſeen the former, thought this meane, and homely; more ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing for what they had loſt, then reioycing in ſo vnequal a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>

As it may fall out, it is ſome peece of miſery to haue beene happier; euery abatement of the degrees of our former height laies ſiege to our thankfulneſſe, for leſſer mercies. Sometimes, it proues an aduantage to haue knowne no better; he ſhall more comfortably inioy preſent bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, who takes them as they are, without any other compariſons, then of the weakeneſſe of his owne deſeruings. It is nothing to mee what my ſelfe or others haue beene, ſo I bee now well: Neither is it otherwiſe in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, if one be more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly built then another, yet if the foundation be rightly layd in both; one may not inſult, the other may not repine: Ech muſt
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:3839:175"/>
congratulate the truth to other, each muſt thankfully inioy it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>The noiſe was not more loud, then confuſed; here was a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant mixture of lamentation, and ſhouting; it was hard to ſay whether drowned the other.</p>
                     <p>This aſſembly of <hi>Iewes</hi> was a true image of Gods Church on earth; one ſings, another cries; neuer doth it all either laugh or mourne at once. It ſhall bee in our triumph that all teares ſhall be wipt from our eyes; till then, our paſſions muſt bee mixed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the occaſions.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> are buſie at worke, not more full of ioy, then hopes; and now that the wals begin to ouerlook the earth; their thoughts
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:3839:176"/>
ſeeme to ouerlooke the walls. But what great enterpriſe was euer ſet on foot for God, which found not ſome croſſes?</p>
                     <p>There was a mungrell brood of <hi>Samarit-Aſſyrians,</hi> which euer ſince the daies of <hi>Senacherib</hi> dwelt in the land of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> whoſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was a patched coate of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall ſhreds; ſome little part Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh, the reſt Pagan, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much variety of idolatry. Theſe hollow neighbours profer their aſſiſtance to the children of the captiuity; <hi>Let vs build with you, for we ſeeke your God, as ye doe: and doe ſacrifice to him.</hi> Might men be their owne iudges, there would bee no hereſie in the world, no miſ-worſhip. It is true; theſe men did ſacrifice to the true God;
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:3839:176"/>
The Lyons taught them to ſeeke, and the Iſraelitiſh Prieſt taught them to find the faſhions of the God of the land: Some of theſe <hi>Iewes</hi> knew their deuotion of old; They ſerued <hi>Iſraels</hi> God; but with their owne: As good no God, as too many. In a iuſt indignation therefore do theſe Iewiſh gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours repell the partnerſhip of ſuch helpers: <hi>You haue nothing to doe with vs, to build an houſe to our God; but we our ſelues together will build vnto the Lord God of Iſrael.</hi> The hand of an idolater is contagious. Yet, had it beene to the building of ſome fortreſſe, or common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, perhaps their ayd had not beene refuſed, but when the wals of Gods houſe are to be raiſed, this ſociety had beene piacular.</p>

Thoſe that may not be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to helpe the worke, will aske no leaue to hinder it: their mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſuggeſtions weaken the hands of the people of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and ſtirre vp authoritie to ſuppreſſe them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cyrus</hi> was farre off; neither liued he long after that gracious commiſſion; and beſides was ſo taken vp the while with his wars, that he could not haue leaſure to ſift thoſe querulous accuſations. Now therefore, during the laſt yeares of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the raigne of his ſonne <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> and the long gouernment of <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> and of his ſonne <hi>Xerxes,</hi> or <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> and laſtly of his ſonne <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> vntill the daies of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Nothus,</hi> (which was no leſſe

                     <p>What a wide gap of time was here betwixt the foundation of Gods houſe, and the battlements? How large a triall doth God now ſecondly take of the faith, of the patience of his people? How large a proofe doth he giue of his own long-ſuffering? Oh God, when thou hadſt but one houſe vpon earth, thou wert content to put vp delayes, yea affronts in the building of it; now thou haſt many, it is no maruell if thy lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganimity

                     <p>A ſmall matter hinders the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt action; as a little fiſh (they ſay) ſtayes the greateſt ſhip: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the <hi>Iewes</hi> were diſcouraged with words, but now they are ſtopped by commands.</p>
                     <p>Theſe enuious <hi>Samaritans</hi> haue corrupted the gouernours which the Perſian Kings ſet ouer thoſe parts; and from their hands haue obtained letters of deepe calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niation, to <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> the King; and after him, to his ſonne <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes;</hi> wherein <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is

                     <p>Princes haue reaſon to bee iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of their rights.

great fauour to any nation, when the hearts of Soueraigne gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are raiſed vp, both to the choice of worthy agents, and to the commanding of pious, and reſtauratiue actions.</p>
                     <p>Holy and carefull <hi>Ezra</hi> gathers a new colony of <hi>Iewes,</hi> takes view of them, at the riuer of <hi>Ahaua;</hi> and finding a miſſe of the ſonnes of <hi>Leui</hi> (without whom no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, no plantation can bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat) ſends for their ſupply; And now, fully furniſhed, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes a faſt in the way.</p>

the courage, and vigour of the multitude may indanger our ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe; But without all theſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall conſultations, he begins with this ſolemne act of humiliation; It is better to haue God ſtrong in our weakneſſe, then to haue fleſh and blood ſtrong in his neglect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was a Patron of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> yet a Pagan by profeſſion; wiſe <hi>Ezra</hi> was afraid of quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe ſparkes of piety which he deſcryed in this ſemi-proſelite.

immediate protection of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. Any death were better then to heare <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> ſay, Is this the man that ſo confidently told me, <hi>The hand of our God is vpon all them for good that ſeeke him; but his power and his wrath is againſt all them that forſake him?</hi> Doth he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue himſelfe that he thus doubts ere he begin? Dare he not truſt his God with his owne buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes?</p>
                     <p>The reſolutions of faithfull hearts are heroicall: No heathen man ſhall ſtumble at <hi>Ezraes</hi> feare: Hee can finde more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in his faſt, then in a <hi>Perſian</hi> band: with a couragious rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance vpon the hand of his God he puts himſelfe into the iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and finds nothing but ſafety

                     <p>In the ſpace of foure moneths is <hi>Ezra,</hi> and his company happily ariued at <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> where hee ioyes to ſee the new Temple, and his old Colleagues: and now hauing deliuered vp the charge of his treaſure, by waight, in the chambers of the houſe of the Lord, hee applies himſelfe to his worke, and deliuers the Kings Commiſſions to the Lieu-tenants and Gouernors, for their vtmoſt aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>The Princes of <hi>Iudah</hi> doe not

(for ought I heare) repine at the large Patent granted to this Prieſt, nor ſay, What doth a man of this robe meddle with placing, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing Magiſtrates? with execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of iudgements to death, bonds, baniſhment? but rather as congratulating this power to ſacred hands, gladly preſent vnto him all their grieuances. Truly religious hearts cannot grudge any honour to their ſpirituall guides.</p>
                     <p>This holy Commiſſioner is ſoone welcomed with a ſad Bill of complaint, from ſome good Peeres of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> wherein they charge diuers of the Prieſts, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites, people, not to haue ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelues from the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous inhabitants of the lands, nor

                     </p>
                     <p>Oh hypocriticall <hi>Iewes,</hi> did ye refuſe to ſuffer your <hi>Samaritan</hi> neighbours to ioyne with you in building a liueleſſe houſe vnto God, and doe ye now ioyne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie with a more accurſed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the building of liuing houſes vnto poſteritie? for the

pulling down of the liuely houſe of God?</p>
                     <p>How could <hi>Ezra</hi> heare this with his cloathes, his haire, his beard vntorne? What griefe, what aſtoniſhment muſt this newes needs bring to a zealous heart? And, were it not that the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his ſincere reſpect to Gods glory relieued him, how could <hi>Ezra</hi> chooſe but repent him of his iourney; and ſay; Am I comne from <hi>Babylon</hi> to find Paganiſme in <hi>Iudah?</hi> Did I leaue <hi>Perſians,</hi> to meet with <hi>Canaanites?</hi> what doe I here, if <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> bee remoued? How much better were a cleare captiutie, then an idolatrous free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? Wo is me, that hauing left many Iewiſh harts in <hi>Babylon,</hi> I now am forced to find heathen

blood in <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As a man diſtracted with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>Ezra</hi> ſits downe vpon the earth with his garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts rent, with the haire of his head, and beard pluckt off, wringing his hands, knocking his breſt, not mouing from his place vntill the euening ſacrifice. It is hard to be too much affected with the publike ſinnes of Gods people. Thoſe who find themſelues in the ſhip of Gods Church, cannot but bee much troubled with euery dangerous leake that it takes: Common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are not more neglected by the careleſſe, then taken to heart by the wiſe, and godly.</p>
                     <p>There, and thus, <hi>Ezra</hi> ſits aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied vntill the euening ſacrifice: others reſorted to him the while;

euen all that tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled at the words of the God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but to help on his ſorrow, not to relieue it; neither doth any man with a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of his owne, or others griefe. At laſt, hee riſes vp from his heauineſſe, and caſts himſelfe vpon his knees, and ſpreads out his hands vnto the Lord his God: Wherefore was all that penſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, faſting, ſilence, tearing of haire and clothes, but to ſerue as a meete preface to his prayers? wherein he ſo freely powres out his hart, as if it had beene all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued into deuotion; profeſsing his ſhame to lift vp his face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the throne of God; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the iniquities of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which were increaſed ouer their heads, and growne vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:3839:187"/>
heauen; fetching their treſpaſſe farre, and charging them deepe; feelingly acknowledging the iuſt hand that had followed them, in all their iudgements, and the iuſt confuſion wherein they now ſtand before the face of their God.</p>
                     <p>Teares, and ſighes, and groue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings accompanied his prayers; the example and noiſe whereof drew <hi>Iſrael</hi> into a participation of this publike mourning, <hi>For the people wept very ſore:</hi> How can they chooſe but thinke, If he thus lament for vs, how ſhould wee grieue for our ſelues?</p>
                     <p>All <hi>Iudah</hi> went away merrily with their ſinne, till this checke of <hi>Ezra,</hi> now they are afflicted: Had not the hands of the Peeres
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:3839:187"/>
beene in this treſpaſſe, the people had not beene guilty; had not the cheekes of <hi>Ezra</hi> beene firſt drenched with teares, the people had not beene penitent. It cannot be ſpoken, what power there is in a great example, whether to euill, or good.</p>
                     <p>Prayers and teares are nothing without indeauors. <hi>Shechaniah,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iehiel</hi> puts the firſt life into this buſineſſe. Hauing ſeconded the complaint of <hi>Ezra,</hi> he now addes, <hi>Yet there is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing. Now therefore let vs make a couenant with our God to put away all the wiues, and ſuch as are borne of them. Ariſe, for this matter belongeth to thee, wee alſo will be with thee; Be of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and doe it.</hi>

When miſchiefe is once done, the chiefe care is how to redreſſe it. The beſt way of redreſſe is the deliberate vndoing of that which wee haue raſhly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; The ſureſt obligation to the vndoing of an euill act, is an oath or couenant made with God for the performance.</p>
                     <p>There is no man ſo wiſe, but hee may make vſe of good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell; there is no man ſo forward, but he may abide incitation. It is no ſmall incouragement to ſee an harty aſſiſtance in an enuious and difficult ſeruice. <hi>Then aroſe Ezra, and made the chiefe Prieſts, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites and all Iſrael to ſweare that they ſhould doe according to this word.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is halfe done that is thus aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured. There was need of a ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g

power to diſſolue a matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, though inordinate loue: Doubtleſſe, theſe men had mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of affection; their hearts were no leſſe ſet vpon theſe wiues (though heatheniſh) then if they had beene of their owne Tribes; neither were their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, thus begotten leſſe deare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, then if they had laine in Iewiſh wombes: Nothing leſſe then an oath of God, therefore could quit theſe paſſions; That is both required and taken</p>
                     <p>Now begins <hi>Ezra</hi> to conceiue ſome hope of preſent redreſſe; the comfort whereof, yet, cannot turne off his ſorrow for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence paſſed; Hee neither eates bread, nor drinkes water; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly puniſhing himſelf, becauſe

                        <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſinned: Now ſhall his Countreymen eaſily reade in his face their owne penance, and iuſt humiliation; and ſay; This man takes no ioy in our ſufferings; hee would not ſmart thus for vs, if he did not deſcry more danger to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs then we can apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</p>
                     <p>Proclamation is made through <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ierurſalem,</hi> vnder paine of forfaiture of ſubſtance, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication from Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; that all the children of the captiuity ſhould gather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues together vnto <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> They are met accordingly; The Courts of Gods houſe are thron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with penitents; and now, as if the heauen would teach them what to doe, the cloudes raine downe aboundance of teares.

What with thoſe ſad ſhowres, what with their inward remorſe, the people ſit trembling in the open Courts; and humbly wait for the reproofe, for the ſentence of <hi>Ezra.</hi> He riſes vp; and with a ſeuere countenance, layes before them their ſinne, their amends: The ſinne of their ſtrange wiues; the amends of their confeſſion, of their ſeparation: not ſparing to ſearch their wound; not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the meet plaiſter for their cure.</p>

                     <p>Thoſe emulous neighbours of theirs, <hi>Sanballat, Tobiah, Geſhem,</hi> the cheife commanders of <hi>Moab, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Arabia,</hi> haue ſoone eſpyed the firſt morter, that is laid vpon that old foundation. Enuy is vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more quicke-ſighted then loue: And now they ſcornfully apply themſelues to theſe deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Iewes,</hi> and thinke to ſcoffe
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:3839:199"/>
them out of their worke: The fauourableſt perſecution of any good cauſe is the laſh of lewd tongues; whether by bitter taunts or by ſcurrilous inuectiues: which it is as impoſſible to auoyd, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to contemne. The bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of theſe dogs doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Nehemiah</hi> from walking on his way; profeſſing his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the God of heauen, whoſe work that was; he ſhakes off their impotent malice, and goes on cheerfully to build: Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Iſraelite</hi> knowes his ſtation. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſhib</hi> the high Prieſt, and the reſt of that ſacred tribe put the firſt hand to this worke; they build the ſheep-gate, and ſanctifie it; and in it, all the reſt. As the firſt fruits of the field, ſo the firſt ſtones
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:3839:200"/>
of the wall, are hallowed to God, by the conſecration of thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout agents: That buſineſſe is like to proſper which beginnes with God.</p>
                     <p>No man was idle, no part was intermitted; All <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was at once encompaſſed with buſie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers. It cannot bee, but the ioynt-indeauors of faithfull harts muſt raiſe the walles of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Sanballat,</hi> and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, find ſome matter to ſpend their ſcoffes vpon; <hi>What doe theſe feeble Iewes? will they fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues? will they ſacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they reuiue the ſtones out of the heapes of rubbiſh which are burnt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How baſely do carnall minds
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:3839:200"/>
thinke of the proiects, and actions of Gods children; therefore vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, becauſe they meaſure them by no other line, then out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward probability. Oh fooliſh <hi>Moabites,</hi> this worke is Gods, and therefore in deſpight of all your tonges and hands, it ſhall proſper: He heares you whom yee haue blaſphemed, and ſhall turne your reproach vpon your own heads.</p>
                     <p>And, thou proud <hi>Ammonite,</hi> that couldſt ſay, <hi>If a Foxe goe vpon their ſtone-wall, hee ſhall breake it downe;</hi> ſhalt well find, that all the wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh troopes of your confederats ſhall not bee able to remoue one ſtone of this ſure fortification; Whiles <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> repine and bluſter in vaine this wal ſhal riſe, &amp; when <hi>Moab</hi> &amp; <hi>Ammon</hi> ſhal
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:3839:201"/>
lye in the duſt, this wall ſhall ſtand. The morter that hath beene tempered with ſo many teares, and layed with ſo many prayers, cannot but out-laſt all the flints, and marbles of humane confidence.</p>
                     <p>Now the growth of this wall hath turned the mirth of the aduerſaries into rage: Theſe <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, Ammonites, Arabians, Aſhdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites</hi> conſpire all together, to fight againſt <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> and whiles the morter is yet greene, to demoliſh thoſe enuied heapes.</p>
                     <p>What hath this City offended in deſiring to be defenced? what wrong could it be to wiſh a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from wrongs? Were this people ſo mighty, that there could be danger in ouer-powring their
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:3839:201"/>
neighbours, or in reſiſting a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſoueraign, there might haue appeared ſome colour for this hoſtile oppoſition; but, alas; what could a deſpiſed handfull doe to the preiudice of either? It is quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell enough to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> that it would not be miſerable.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it otherwiſe with the head of theſe helliſh compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; there needs no other cauſe of his vtmoſt fury, then to ſee a poor ſoule ſtrugling to get out of the reach of his tyrannie. So doe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage beaſts briſtle vp themſelues, and make the moſt fierce aſſaults when they are in danger of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the prey, which they had once ſeized on.</p>
                     <p>In the meane while, what doth <hi>Nehemiah</hi> with his <hi>Iewes</hi> for their
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:3839:202"/>
common ſafety? They pray, and watch; they pray vnto God, they watch againſt the enemy.</p>
                     <p>Thus, thus ſhall wee happily preuaile againſt thoſe ſpirituall wickedneſſes, which war againſt our ſoules: No euill can ſurprize vs if we watch; no euill can hurt vs, if we pray; <hi>This is the victory that ouercomes the world, euen our faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was need of a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vigilancy; the enemy was not more malicious, then ſubtle, and had ſaid; <hi>They ſhall not know, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee, till wee come in the midſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and ſlay them.</hi> Open force is not ſo dangerous, as cloſe diſſimulation; They meant to ſeeme <hi>Iewes,</hi> whiles they were <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammonites;</hi> and in the
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:3839:202"/>
clothes of brethren purpoſed to hide murderers. Neuer is Satan ſo preuailent, as when hee comes transformed into an Angell of light.</p>
                     <p>It was a mercifull prouidence of God, that made theſe mens tongues the blabs of their owne counſell. Many a fearfull deſigne had proſpered, if wickedneſſe could haue beene ſilent. Warning is a lawfull gard to a wiſe aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: Now doth <hi>Nehemiah</hi> arme his people; and for the time, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges their trowels into ſwords, &amp; ſpeares, and bowes; raiſing vp their courage with a vehement exhortation, to remember the Lord, which is <hi>great, and terrible, and to fight for their brethren, their ſonnes, their daughters, their wiues,</hi>
                        <pb n="396" facs="tcp:3839:203"/>
and their houſes. Nothing can ſo harten vs to the encountring of any euill, as the remembrance of that infinite power and wiſdome which can either auert, or mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, or ſanctifie it: wee could not faint if wee did not forget God.</p>
                     <p>Neceſſity vrges a man to fight for himſelf, loue inables his hand to fight for thoſe which challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge a part in him; where loue meets with neceſſity, there can want no indeuor of victory; Neceſſity can make euen cowards, valiant; loue makes the valiant, vnreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: <hi>Nehemiah</hi> doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perſwade theſe <hi>Iewes</hi> to fight for themſelues, but for theirs: The inlargement of the intereſt, and danger, cannot but quicken the dulleſt ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="397" facs="tcp:3839:203"/>
Diſcouered counſels are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die preuented; Theſe ſerpents dye by being firſt ſeene; <hi>When the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies heard that it was knowne vnto vs,</hi> they let fall their plot. Could wee deſcry the enterpriſes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that tempter would returne aſhamed.</p>
                     <p>It is a ſafe point of wiſedome to carrie a iealous eye ouer thoſe, whom we haue once found hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and hoſtile: From that time forth <hi>Nehemiah</hi> diuided the taske, betwixt the trowell, and the ſword; ſo diſpoſing of euery <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite,</hi> that whiles one hand was a Maſon, the other was a ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: one is for worke, the other for defence. Oh liuely image of the Church militant, wherein e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one labours, weaponed;
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:3839:204"/>
wherein there is neither an idle ſouldier, nor a ſecure workman: euery one ſo builds, as that he is ready to ward temptations; eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one ſo wields the ſword of the ſpirit, for defence, that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, hee builds vp himſelfe in his moſt holy faith; here is neither a fruitleſſe valour, nor an vnſafe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</p>
                     <p>But what can our weapons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile vs, if there be not meanes to warne vs of an enemie? Without a Trumpet we are armed in vain. <hi>The worke is great and large, and we are ſeparated vpon the wall, one farre from another:</hi> Yea, ſo farre as the vtmoſt bounds of the earth, are wee ſeparated one from another, vpon the wals of the ſpirituall <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> onely the ſacred Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets

                     <p>There is no remedy, the <hi>Iewes</hi> are ſo taken vp with their trowel, and ſword, for the time, that they cannot attend their trades; ſo as, whiles the wall did riſe, their eſtates muſt needs impayre: Euen in the cheapeſt ſeaſon they muſt needs be poore, that earned nothing but the publike ſafetie, how much more in a common ſcarcity? their houſes, lands, vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards are therefore morgaged, yea their very skins are ſold, for corn,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:3839:206"/>
to their brethren: Neceſſity forces them to ſell that, which it was cruelty to buy; What will we not, what muſt we not part with, for life? The couetous rulers did not conſider the occaſions of this want, but the aduantage. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, a bargaine may bee as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull as a robbery: Charity muſt be the rule in all contracts; the violation whereof, whether in the matter, or the price, cannot but be ſinfull.</p>
                     <p>There could not bee a iuſter ground of expoſtulation then this of the oppreſſed <hi>Iewes: Our fleſh is as the fleſh of our brethren, our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as their children; and loe, we bring into bondage our ſonnes and our daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> whiles there is no difference in nature, why ſhould there bee

ſuch an iniurious diſproportion in condition. Euen the ſame fleſh may beare a iuſt inequality; Some may be rulers, whiles others are ſubiect; Some wealthy, others poore; but why thoſe wealthy rulers ſhould tyrannize ouer thoſe poore inferiours, and turne brotherhood into bondage no reaſon can be giuen but lawleſſe ambition; If there were one fleſh of Peeres, another of Peaſants, there ſhould be ſome colour for the proud impoſitions of the great, as becauſe the fleſh of beaſts is in a lower ranke then ours, we kill, we deuoure it at pleaſure; but now, ſince the large body of mankinde conſiſts of the ſame fleſh, why ſhould the hand ſtrike the foot? And if one fleſh may

How ſhould that one ſpirit cauſe vs ſo farre to forget all naturall,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:3839:208"/>
and ciuill differences, as not to contemne, not to oppreſſe any whom it informeth?</p>
                     <p>They are not Chriſtians, not men, that can inioy the miſeries of their brethren, whether in the fleſh or ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>Good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> cannot chooſe but bee much moued at the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous extortion of the people; and now, like an vnpartiall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, hee rebukes the Rulers and Nobles, whoſe hand was thus bloody with oppreſſion. As of fiſhes, ſo of men, the leſſer are a prey to the great: It is an ill vſe made of power, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the weight of it ſerues onely to cruſh the weake.

                     <p>If nobility doe embaſe it ſelfe to any foule ſinne, it is ſo much more worthy of coertion, by how much the perſon is of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter marke.</p>
                     <p>The iuſtice of this reproofe could not but ſhame impudence it ſelfe; <hi>Wee after our abilitie haue redeemed our brethren the Iewes which were ſold to the heathen, and will you ſell your brethren, or ſhall they be ſold to vs?</hi> Shall they finde at home that yoke of bondage which they had put off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad? whiles they are ſtill <hi>Iewes,</hi> ſhall we turne <hi>Aſſyrians?</hi> If they muſt be ſlaues, why not rather to

How much more tollerable were a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne ſeruitude, then a domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call: Be aſhamed, ô ye Nobles of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to renue <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> I maruell not if the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders be ſtricken dumbe with ſo vnanſwerable an expoſtulation; Guiltineſſe, and confuſion haue ſtopt their mouthes.</p>
                     <p>Many of thoſe who haue not had grace enough to refraine ſin, yet are not ſo vtterly void of grace as to maintaine ſinne; Our after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wits are able to diſcerne a kinde of vnreaſonableneſs in thoſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked actions, which the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance repreſents vnto vs plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.

beare out commodious, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant euills; neither could theſe <hi>Iewiſh</hi> enormities, haue wanted ſome colours of defence; Their ſtocke was their owne, which might haue beene otherwiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, to no leſſe profit; The offer, the ſuit of theſe bargaines was from the ſellers; Theſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheates fell into their hands, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought; neither did their contract cauſe the neede of their brethren, but releeue it: But their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will not beare this plea. I know not whether the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the leaſt euill bee not worſe, then the commiſſion of the greateſt; This may bee of frailty, that argues obſtinacy: There is hope of that man that can bluſh, and be ſilent.</p>

                        <pb n="410" facs="tcp:3839:210"/>
After conuiction of the fact, it is ſeaſonable for <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> to perſwade reformation: No ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory is ſo powerfull, as that of mildneſſe: eſpecially when we haue to doe with thoſe, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through ſtomach, or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, may not indure a rough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe: The drops that fall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily vpon the corne, ripen, and fill the eare, but the ſtormy ſhowers that fal with violence, beat down the ſtalkes flat to the earth, and lay whole fields, without hope of recouery. Who can reſiſt this ſweet &amp; ſoueraign reprehenſion; <hi>Ought yee not to walke in the feare of our God, becauſe of the reproach of the heathen, our enemies?</hi> Did we dwell alone in the midſt of the earth, yet the feare of our God
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:3839:210"/>
ſhould ouer-awe our wayes; but now that we dwell in the midſt of our enemies, whoſe eies are bent vpon all our actions, whoſe tongues are as ready to blaſpheme God, as we to offend him, how carefully ſhould we auoid thoſe ſins, which may draw ſhame vpon our profeſſion?</p>
                     <p>Now, the ſcandall is worſe then the fact; Thus, ſhall religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuffer more from the heathen, then our brethren doe from vs: If iuſtice, if charity cannot ſway with vs, yet, let the ſcornfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations of the prophane Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, afright vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe preſſures. No ingenuous diſpoſition can be ſo tender of his own diſgrace, as the true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> is of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch of his God: What is it that
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:3839:211"/>
hee will not rather refraine, doe, ſuffer, then that glorious name ſhall hazard a blemiſh? They cannot want outward retentiues from ſin, that liue either among friends, or enemies; if friends, they may not be grieued, if ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they may not be prouoked: Thoſe that would liue well, muſt ſtand in awe of all eyes; Euen thoſe that are without the Church yet may not bee without our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard: No perſon can bee ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, as that his cenſure ſhould be contemned.</p>
                     <p>In diſſuading from ſinne, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſelfe cannot preuaile more then example. <hi>I likewiſe, and my brethren, and my ſeruants might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act of them money, and corne. But from the time that I was appointed to</hi>
                        <pb n="413" facs="tcp:3839:211"/>
                        <hi>the charge of Iudah, I, and my brethren haue not eaten the bread of the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> Hee ſhall neuer rule well, that doth all that hee may: It is not ſafe for either part, that a Prince ſhould liue at the height of his power: And if the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt abate of their right, is it for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors to extort? Had <hi>Nehemiah</hi> aimed at his own greatneſſe, no man could haue had fairer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences for his gaine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The former gouernors that were before him were chargeable vnto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beſides fourty ſhekels of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</hi> His foot had not firſt trod in this commodious path; it was beaten by the ſteps of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; neither did any of them walke beſide it: How euer it
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:3839:212"/>
might bee enuious to raiſe new taxations, yet to continue thoſe he found vnrepined at, had been out of the reach of exception: A good Gouernour lookes not ſo much what hath beene done, as what ſhould bee; Precedents are not the rule, whereby hee rules, but iuſtice, but piety. <hi>So did not I, becauſe of the feare of the Lord:</hi> Lawes are not a ſtraiter curbe to ſubiects, then conſcience is to good Princes.</p>
                     <p>They dare not doe what they cannot doe charitably: what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage can they thinke it to bee from vnder the controllment of men, when the God of heauen notes, and puniſhes their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Who ſo walketh by this rule, can neither erre, nor miſ-cary; It
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:3839:212"/>
is not truſting to the externall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of ſinne, either they are not alwaies preſent; or if preſent, not powerfull enough; but if the feare of God haue once taken vp the heart, it goes euer with vs, and is ſtrong enough to ouer-maiſter the forceableſt temptation.</p>
                     <p>Therefore muſt theſe <hi>Iewes</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this example of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> becauſe he followed not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his predeceſſors; becauſe he left their euill, they muſt imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his good. In vaine ſhall ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers aduiſe againſt their owne practice; when they lead the way, they may well challenge to bee followed: Seldome hath it been euer ſeene that great perſons haue not beene ſeconded in euill, why ſhould not their power ſerue to
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:3839:213"/>
make patternes of their vertues?</p>
                     <p>Thus well did it ſpeed with <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> his mercifull cariage, and zealous ſuit haue drawne the Rulers to a promiſe of reſtitution; <hi>We will reſtore them, and will require nothing of them, ſo will we doe as thou ſayeſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is no ſmall aduantage that theſe Nobles muſt forgoe, in their releaſes: there cannot be a better ſigne of a ſound amendment, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that we can be content to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers by our repentance; Many formall penitents haue yeelded to part with ſo much of their ſinne, as may abate nothing of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; as if theſe Rulers ſhould haue beene willing to reſtore the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but withall ſhould haue ſtood ſtifly to require their ſums:
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:3839:213"/>
This whining and partiall ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction had been thankleſſe. True remorſe inlargeth the heart, and openeth the hand to a bountifull redemption of our errors.</p>
                     <p>Good purpoſes doe too often coole in time, and vaniſh into a careleſſe forgetfulneſſe; <hi>Nehemiah</hi> feared this iſſue of theſe holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions; and therfore he proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes them in their firſt heat; not leauing theſe promiſes, till he had ſecured them, with an oath; The Prieſts are called for, that in their mouthes, the adiuration may be more ſolemne, &amp; ſacred; It is the beſt point of wiſedome to take the firſt opportunity of fixing good motions, which otherwiſe are of themſelues light, &amp; ſleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. To make all yet more ſure,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:3839:214"/>
their oathes are croſſe-barred with his execration. <hi>Alſo I ſhooke my lap, and ſaid, ſo God ſhake out euery man from his houſe, and from his labour that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth not this promiſe, euen thus be he ſhaken out, and emptied, and all the Congregation ſaid, Amen.</hi> A promiſe, an oath, a curſe, are paſſed vpon this act; now, no <hi>Iſraelite</hi> dares falter in the execution: When we haue a ſin in chace, it is good to follow it home, not ſlackning our purſuit till we haue fully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed; and when it is once falne vnder our hands, we cannot kill it too much.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Nehemiah</hi> hauing thus happily deliuered his people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a domeſticall captiuity, comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds his ſeruice to the gracious remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:3839:214"/>
of the Almighty; <hi>Thinke vpon me my God, for good, according to all that I haue done for this people;</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth hee refuſe the bread of the Gouernour, that hee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the reward of the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of heauen: Had hee taken a temporary recompence, both he and it had beene forgotten, now he hath made an happy change for eternity. Not that he pleades his merit, but ſues for mercy; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he pray to bee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred for his work, but according to his worke.</p>
                     <p>Our good deedes as they are well accepted of God, ſo they ſhall not goe vnrewarded; and what God will giue, why may not wee craue. Doubtleſſe, as we may offer vp our honeſt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:3839:215"/>
vnto God, ſo we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and beg his promiſed retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions; not out of a proud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the worth of our earnings, who at the beſt are no other then vnprofitable ſeruants; but out of a faithfull dependance vpon his pact of bounty, who cannot bee leſſe then his word: O God, if we doe ought that is good, it is thine act, and not ours; crowne thine owne worke in vs, and take thou the glory of thine own mercies.</p>
                     <p>Whiles <hi>Nehemiah</hi> is buſie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming abuſes, at home; the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy is plotting againſt him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; <hi>Sanballat,</hi> and <hi>Tobiah,</hi> and <hi>Geſhem</hi> the <hi>Arabian</hi> conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his life, and in him, againſt the peace of <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> What open
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:3839:215"/>
hoſtility could not do, they hope to effect by pretence of treaties: Foure ſeuerall meſſages call <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> to a friendly meeting. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt is a ſure gard. The wiſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor hath learn'd to ſuſpect the hollow fauours of an enemy; and to returne them, with ſafe and iuſt excuſes. <hi>I cannot come downe, why ſhould the worke ceaſe whiles I leaue it, and come downe to you?</hi> I doe not heare him ſay, You in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend miſchiefe to mee; I will not come forth to you; though this were the proper cauſe of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, but he hee turnes them off with an anſwer, that had as much truth, as reſeruedneſſe. Fraud is the fitlieſt anſwered with ſubtlety: Euen innocencie is allowed a lawfull craft; That

                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Iewes thinke to rebell:</hi> A ſtale ſuggeſtion, but, once, powerfull; Malice hath learn'd to miſcall all actions; where the hands cannot bee taxed, very thoughts are preiudged: <hi>For which cauſe thou buildeſt the wall, that thou mayeſt be their King;</hi> Hee was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> that hath not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpightfull ſlanders, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtructions: <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> knew his ſeruant too well, to beleeue any rumour, that ſhould haue beene ſo ſhameleſſe; The ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was wel known to reach onely to the cup, not to
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:3839:217"/>
the Scepter of his Soueraign: And yet, to make vp a ſound tale, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are ſuborned to preach, There is a King in Iudah:</hi> as if that loyall gouernor had corrupted the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits alſo; and had taught them the language of treaſon.</p>
                     <p>But what of all this? what if ſome falſe tongue haue whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſuch idle tales? It is not ſafe for thee, <hi>O Nehemiah,</hi> to contemn report: Perhaps this newes ſhal fly to the Court, and worke thee a deadly diſpleaſure ere thou canſt know thy ſelfe traduced; Come therefore, and let vs take counſell together: Surely that man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſparing of any thing, that is prodigall of his reputation. If ought vnder heauen can fetch <hi>Nehemiah</hi> out of his hold, it is the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:3839:217"/>
care of his fame. But, that wary gouernour ſees a net ſpred neere vnto this ſtall; and therfore keeps aloofe, not without contempt of thoſe ſlie deuiſes. <hi>There are no ſuch things done as thou ſayeſt, but thou faineſt them out of thine owne heart:</hi> Some imputations are beſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with a neglectiue deniall: It fals out often that plaine dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling puts craft out of countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</p>
                     <p>Since neither force nor fraud can kill <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> they will now try to draw him into a ſinne, and thereby into a reproach; O God, that any Prophets tongue ſhould be mercenary! <hi>Shemaiah</hi> the Seer, is hyred by <hi>Tobiah,</hi> and <hi>Sanballat,</hi> to affright the Gouernour, with the noyſe of his intended mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and to aduiſe him for ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:3839:218"/>
to flye to the forbidden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of the Temple. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour was faire. Violence is meant to thy perſon, no place but one can promiſe thee ſafetie; The City hath as yet no gates; come therefore, and ſhut thy ſelfe vp in the Temple, there onely ſhalt thou be free from all aſſaults.</p>
                     <p>And what if <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had harkened to this counſell? Sinne, and ſhame had followed; That holy place was for none but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſacred; ſuch as were priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by blood, and function; others ſhould preſume, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in entring; and now, what would the people ſay? What ſhall become of vs whiles our Gouernour hides his head for feare? When ſhall wee finde a
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:3839:218"/>
Temple to ſecure vs? What doe wee depending vpon a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly leader?</p>
                     <p>Well did <hi>Nehemiah</hi> fore-caſt theſe circumſtances, both of act, and euent, and therefore reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to diſtruſt a Prophet that perſwaded him to the violation of a Law, hee reiects the motion with ſcorne; <hi>Should ſuch a man as I flee? Should I goe into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſaue my life? I will not goe:</hi> It is fit for great perſons to ſtand vpon the honour of their places; Their very ſtations ſhould put thoſe ſpirits into them, that ſhould make them hate to ſtoope vnto baſe conditions.</p>
                     <p>Had God ſent this meſſage, wee know hee hath power to diſpence with his owne Lawes;
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:3839:219"/>
but well might the contradiction of a Law argue the meſſage not ſent of God. God as he is one, ſo doth hee perfitly agree with himſelfe. If any priuate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit croſſe a written word, let him be accurſed.</p>

                     <p>This great Monarch, partly in triumph of the great victories, that he hath lately wonne in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, and partly, for the anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Princes, and ſouldiers,

                     <p>All other feaſts were but hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to this of <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> whether we regard the number of gueſts, or the largeneſſe of preparation, or continuance of time: During the ſpace of a whole halfe yeare, all the tables were ſumptuouſly furniſhed for all commers from <hi>India,</hi> to <hi>Ethyopia;</hi> A world of meat was euery day dreſſed for a world of men; Euery meale was ſo ſet on, as if it ſhould haue beene the laſt: Yet all this long
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:3839:221"/>
feaſt hath an end; and all this glory is ſhut vp in forgetfulneſſe; What is <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> the better, that his Peeres then ſaid, hee was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably great? What are his Peeres the better, that they were feaſted? Happy is he that eates bread, and drinkes new wine in the Kingdome of God; this ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet is for eternity, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, without ſatiety.</p>

<pb n="433" facs="tcp:3839:221"/>
of <hi>Shuſhan</hi> are intertained, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen daies with equall pompe and ſtate; The ſpacious Court of the Palace is turned into a Royall Hall, the walls are rich hangings, the pillars of marble, the beds of ſiluer and gold, the pauement of porphirie curiouſly checkered; The wine and the veſſels ſtroue whether ſhould bee the richer; no man drunke in worſe then gold; and whiles the mettall was the ſame, the forme of each cup was diuers; the attendants was anſwerable to the cheare; and the freedome matched both: Here was no compulſion, either to the meaſure, or quality of the draught; euery mans rule was his owne choice. Who can but bluſh to ſee forced healths in Chriſtian
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:3839:222"/>
banquets, when the ciuility of very pagans commands liberty.</p>
                     <p>I cannot but enuy the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of heathen Dames; <hi>Vaſhti</hi> the Queene, and her Ladies, with all the ſeuerall rankes of that ſexe, feaſt apart; intertaining each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with a baſhfull curteſie, without wantonneſſe, without that wild ſcurrility, which v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to haunt promiſcuous mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: Oh ſhamefull vnchaſtity of thoſe looſe Chriſtians, who muſt feed their luſt, whiles they fill their bellies; and thinke the feaſt vnperfit, where they may not ſate their eye no leſſe then their palate.</p>
                     <p>The laſt day of this pompous feaſt is now come: King <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerus</hi> is ſo much more cheerfull,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:3839:222"/>
by how much his gueſts are nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to their diſmiſſion. Euery one is wont to cloſe vp his curteſie with ſo much more paſſion, as the laſt acts vſe to make the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per impreſſion; And now, that he might at once amaze, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deare the beholders, <hi>Vaſhti</hi> the Queene in all her royalty, is called for; Her ſight ſhall ſhut vp the feaſt, that the Princes and people may ſay, How happy is King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſuerus,</hi> not ſo much in this greatneſſe, as in that beauty.</p>
                     <p>Seuen officers of the chamber are ſent to cary the meſſage, to attend her entrance, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with a deniall: Perhaps <hi>Vaſhti</hi> thought; What meanes this vncouth motion? More then ſixe moneths hath this feaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued;
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:3839:223"/>
and, all this while wee haue inioyed the wonted liberty of our ſexe; Were the King ſtill himſelfe, this command could not bee ſent; it is the wine, and not hee, that is guiltie of this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand; Is it for mee to humour him in ſo vaine a deſire? Will it agree with our modeſt reſerued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to offer our ſelues to bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at by millions of eyes? Who knowes what wanton attempts may follow vpon this vngouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned exceſſe? This very meſſage argues that wit, and reaſon haue yeelded their places to that beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting liquor. Nothing but abſence can ſecure vs from ſome vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming profer; neither doubt I, but the King when he returnes to himſelfe, will giue me thankes
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:3839:223"/>
for ſo wiſe a forbearance.</p>
                     <p>Thus, vpon the conceit (as is likely) that her preſence would bee either needleſſe, or vnſafe. <hi>Vaſhti</hi> refuſeth to come. Although perhaps her great ſpirits thought much to receiue a command fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hand of officers.</p>
                     <p>The blood that is once infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with wine, is apt to boyle with rage: <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> is very wroth with this indigne repulſe: It was the oſtentation of his glory, and might, that hee affected, before thoſe Princes, Peeres, people; and now that ſeemes eclipſed, in the ſhutting vp of all his magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, with the diſgraceful affront of a woman. It vexes him to thinke, that thoſe Nobles, whom hee meant to ſend away aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:3839:224"/>
with the admiration of his power, and maieſty, ſhould now ſay: What boots it <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> to rule afarre off, when hee cannot command at home? In vaine doth he boaſt to gouerne Kings, whiles hee is checked by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                     <p>What euer were the intentions of <hi>Vaſhti,</hi> ſurely her diſobedience was inexcuſable; it is not for a good wife to iudge of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands will, but to execute it: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wit, nor ſtomacke may carie her into a curious inquiſition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the reaſons of an inioyned charge, much leſſe to a reſiſtance: but in an hood-winkt ſimplicity ſhe muſt follow, whither ſhee is led; as one that holds her chiefe praiſe to conſiſt in ſubiection.</p>

                        <pb n="439" facs="tcp:3839:224"/>
Where ſhould the perfection of wiſedome dwell, if not in the Courts of great Princes? or what can the treaſures of Monarchs purchaſe more invaluably preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, then learned and iudicious attendance? Or who can be ſo fit for honour as the wiſeſt.</p>
                     <p>I doubt how <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> could haue beene ſo great, if his throne had not beene ſtill compaſſed with them that knew the times, and vnderſtood the law, and iudgement. Theſe were his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in all his doubts: Theſe are now conſulted in this difficulty; neither muſt their aduice bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly whiſpered, in the Kings eare, but publikely deliuered in the audience of all the Princes. It is a perillous way that theſe ſages
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:3839:225"/>
are called to goe, betwixt an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife; eſpecially of ſuch power, and eminency; yet <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mucan</hi> feares not to paſſe an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie ſentence againſt Queen <hi>Vaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti. Vaſhti, the Queene hath not done wrong to the King onely, but alſo to all the Princes, and all the people, that are in all the Prouinces of the King A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſuerus.</hi> A deepe and ſore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; iniuries are ſo much more intolerable, as they are dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto more; thoſe offences which are of narrow extent, may receiue an eaſie ſatisfaction; the amends are not poſſible, where the wrong is vniuerſall: <hi>For this deed of the Queene ſhall come abroad to all women, ſo that they ſhall deſpiſe their husbands in their eyes:</hi> Indeed ſo publique a fact muſt needs fly;
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:3839:225"/>
That concourſe gaue fit opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to diffuſe it all the world o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; The examples of the great are eaſily drawne into rules. Bad leſſons are apt to be taken out; as honour, ſo contempt fals downe from the head to the skirts; neuer aſcends from the skirts to the head.</p>
                     <p>Theſe wiſe men are ſo much the more ſenſible of this danger, as they ſaw it more likely, the caſe might proue their owne. <hi>Likewiſe ſhall the Ladies of Perſia and Media ſay this day vnto all the Kings Princes.</hi> The firſt prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of euill muſt bee carefully auoided, if wee care to keepe a conſtant order in good. Prudence cannot better beſtirre it ſelfe, then in keeping miſchiefe from home.</p>

The foundation of this doom of <hi>Memucan</hi> is not laid ſo deep for nothing; <hi>If it pleaſe the King let there goe a royall commandement from him, and let it bee written among the lawes of the Perſians, and Medians, that it bee not altered, that Vaſhti come no more before Ahaſuerus; and let the King giue her royall eſtate to another that is better then ſhe.</hi> How bold a word was this, and how hazardous? Had <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> more loued the beauty of <hi>Vaſhti,</hi> then his honor, <hi>Memucan</hi> had ſpoken this againſt his owne life: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, a Queene of ſo great ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, could not want ſtrength of fauour, and faction, in the Perſian Court; which could not but take fire at ſo deſperate a motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtateſmen, ouerlooking pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate

reſpects, muſt bend their eies vpon publique dangers, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to preuent a common miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, though with the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their owne. Nature had taught theſe Pagans the neceſſitie of a female ſubiection; and the hate and ſcorne of a proud diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. They haue vnlearned the very dictates of Nature, that can abide the head to bee ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ribbe.</p>
                     <p>I cannot ſay but <hi>Vaſhti</hi> was worthy of a ſharpe cenſure; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay ſhe was worthy a repudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. This plaiſter drew too hard; It was but heathen iuſtice to puniſh the wiues diſobedience in one indifferent act, with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce: Nothing but the violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mariage-bed, can either
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:3839:227"/>
breake, or vntye the knot of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Had ſhe not been a Queen, had not that contemptuous act beene publique, the ſentence had not beene ſo hard; now the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment muſt be exemplary, leſt the ſin ſhould be ſo.

                     <p>The King, the Princes approue this heauy iudgment of <hi>Memucan;</hi> It is not in the power of the faire face of <hi>Vaſhti,</hi> to warrant her ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke: No doubt many meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges paſſed ere the rigour of this execution: That great hart knows not to rele<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but will rather break, then yeeld to an humble depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                     <p>Perhaps the wiſe Iew feared, that whiles her honour was yet greene, and vnſetled, the notice of her nation, and the name of a deſpiſed captiue might bee ſome blemiſh to her in that proud Court; when as afterwards, vpon

Great mens anger is like to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſtrong, fierce, ambitious of an exceſſiue ſatisfaction. <hi>Haman</hi> ſcornes to take vp with the blood of <hi>Mordecai;</hi> This were but a vulgar amends; Poore men can kill where they hate, and expiate their owne wrong, with the life of a ſingle enemie: <hi>Hamans</hi> fury ſhall fly an higher pitch; Millions of threats are few enow to bleed for this offence: It is a <hi>Iew</hi> that hath deſpighted him; all the whole nation of the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhall periſh for the ſtomach of this one: The Monarchy of the world was now in the hand of the <hi>Perſian,</hi> as <hi>Iudaea</hi> was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this compaſſe, ſo there was ſcarce a <hi>Iew</hi> vpon earth, without the verge of the <hi>Perſian</hi> domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:

                     <p>That which was intended to procure reſt, ſets it off; King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſuerus</hi> is vnquiet in himſelfe, to think that ſo great a merit ſhould lye, but ſo long, neglected; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he find any peace in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, till hee haue giuen order for a ſpeedy retribution: hearing therefore by his ſeruants, that <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was below in the Court, hee ſends for him vp, to conſult with him, <hi>What ſhould be done to the man</hi>

                        <hi>whom the King delighteth to honour:</hi> O maruellous concurrence of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, drawne together by the infinite vviſedome, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Almighty: Who but <hi>Haman</hi> ſhould be the man?

Had <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> but ſlept that night, <hi>Mordecai</hi> had beene that morning aduanced fifty cubits higher then the earth, ere the king could haue remembred to vvho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he vvas beholden.</p>
                     <p>What ſhall vvee ſay then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile theſe croſſe-paſſions in <hi>Ahaſuerus?</hi> Before he ſigned that decree of killing all the <hi>Iewes,</hi> hee could not but know that a <hi>Iew</hi>
                        <pb n="521" facs="tcp:3839:265"/>
had ſaued his life; and now, after that he hath enacted the ſlaughter of all <hi>Iewes,</hi> as rebels, he is giuing order to honour a <hi>Iew,</hi> as his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruer. It were ſtrange if great perſons in the multitude of their diſtractions ſhould not let fall ſome incongruities.</p>
                     <p>Yet, vvho can but think that king <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> meant vpon ſome ſecond thoughts to make amends to <hi>Mordecai?</hi> neither can he chooſe but put theſe two together; The <hi>Iewes</hi> are appointed to death, at the ſuit of <hi>Haman;</hi> This <hi>Mordecai</hi> is a <hi>Iew;</hi> how then can I doe more grace to him, that hath ſaued my life, then to command him to be honored by that man who vvould ſpill his?</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Haman</hi> heard himſelfe
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:3839:266"/>
called vp to the bed-chamber of his maſter, he thinks himſelfe too happy in ſo early an oportunity of preſenting his ſuit; but yet more in the pleaſing queſtion of <hi>Ahaſuerus;</hi> vvherein he could not but imagine that fauour forced it ſelfe vpon him vvith ſtrange im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity; For how could hee conceiue that any intention of more then ordinary honor could fall beſides himſelfe? Selfe-loue, like to a good ſtomach, drawes to it ſelfe what nouriſhment it likes; and caſts off that which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends it. <hi>Haman</hi> will bee ſure to bee no niggard in aduiſing thoſe ceremonies of honour, which he thinkes meant to his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Could hee haue once drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that this grace had been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:3839:266"/>
to any vnder heauen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelfe, he had not beene ſo lauiſh in counſelling ſo pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous a ſhew of exceſſiue magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence. Now the Kings owne royall apparell, and his owne Steed is not ſufficient, except the royall Crowne alſo make vp the glory of him, who ſhall thus tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in the kings fauour. Yet all this were nothing in baſe hands: The actor ſhall be the beſt part of this great pageant. <hi>Let this appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and this horſe, be deliuered to one of the Kings moſt noble Princes, that they may aray the man withall, whom the King delighteth to honour, and bring him on horſe backe through the ſtreets of the City, and proclaime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, Thus ſhall it be done to the man whom the King delighteth to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
                        <pb n="524" facs="tcp:3839:267"/>
Honour is more in him that giues, then him that receiues it: To be honoured by the vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy is little better then diſgrace; No meaner perſon will ſerue to attend this <hi>Agagite,</hi> in his ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed greatneſſe, then one of the nobleſt Princes. The ambition is too high flowne that ſeekes glory in the ſeruility of equals.</p>
                     <p>The place addes much to the act; There is ſmall hart in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed honour; It is nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the ſtreets of the city <hi>Shuſhan</hi> be witneſſes of this pompe, and ring with that gracious accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                     <p>The vaine harts of proud men can eaſily deuiſe thoſe meanes, whereby they may beſt ſet out themſelues. Oh that wee could
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:3839:267"/>
equally affect the meanes of true and immortall glory. The heart of man is neuer ſo cold within him, as when from the height of the expectation of good, it falls into a ſudden ſenſe of euill: So did this <hi>Agagites. Then the King ſayd to Haman, make haſt, and take the apparell, and the horſe, as thou haſt ſaid, and doe euen ſo to Mordecai the Iew, that ſitteth at the Kings gate; Let nothing faile of all that thou haſt ſaid.</hi> How was <hi>Haman</hi> thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricken with this killing word? <hi>Doe thou ſo to Mordecai?</hi> I dare ſay all the honors that <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> had heaped vpon <hi>Haman,</hi> cannot counteruaile this one vexation: Doubtleſſe, at firſt, he diſtruſts his eare, and then muzes whether the King be in earneſt; at laſt, when
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:3839:268"/>
he heares the charge ſo ſeriouſly doubled, and findes himſelfe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to beleeue it, hee beginnes to thinke, What meanes this vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuable alteration? Is there no man in all the Court of <hi>Perſia</hi> to bee pickt out for extraordinary honor, but <hi>Mordecai?</hi> Is there no man to bee pickt out for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this honour to him, but <hi>Haman?</hi> haue I but one proud enemie in all the world, and am I ſingled out to grace him? Did it gall me to the heart, and make all my happineſſe tedious vnto mee, to ſee that this <hi>Iew</hi> would not bow to me, &amp; muſt I now bow to him? That which he would rather dye, and forfait the life of all his nation, then doe to mee, notwithſtanding the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:3839:268"/>
ſhall I bee forced by the Kings command to doe vnto him? Yea, did hee refuſe to giue but a cap, and a knee to my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and muſt I lacquay ſo baſe a fellow through the ſtreets, muſt I be his herald to proclaime his honour through all <hi>Shuſhan?</hi> Why doe I not let the King know the inſolent affronts that hee hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me? Why doe I not ſignifie to my Soueraigne, that my errand now was for another kinde of aduancement to <hi>Mordecai?</hi> If I obtaine not my deſired reuenge, yet, at leaſt, I ſhall preuaile ſo far, as to exempt my ſelfe from this officious attendance vpon ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall an enemy. And yet, that motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be now ſafe; I ſee the Kings heart is (vpon what grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

ſo euer) bent vpon this action; ſhould I flye off neuer ſo little (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my word ſo directly paſſed) perhaps my coldneſſe, or oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be conſtrued as ſome wayward conteſtation with my maſter: Eſpecially, ſince the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice that <hi>Mordecai</hi> hath done to the King, is of an higher nature, then the deſpight which he hath done to mee. I will, I muſt giue way for the time; mine humble yeeldance, (when all the cariage of this buſineſſe ſhall bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood) ſhal (I doubt not) make way for mine intended reuenge: <hi>Mordecai,</hi> I will honor thee now, that by theſe ſteps, I may ere long raiſe thee many cubits higher. I will obey the command of my ſoueraigne in obſeruing thee, that
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:3839:269"/>
he may reward the merit of my loyalty, in thine execution.</p>
                     <p>Thus reſolued, <hi>Haman</hi> goes forth, with a face and heart full of diſtraction, full of confuſion; and addreſſes himſelfe to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyring, to the attending of his old aduerſary, and new maſter, <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai;</hi> What lookes doe we now think were caſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> each other, at their firſt greeting? their eyes had not forgotten their old language; Certainly, when <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſaw <hi>Haman</hi> come into the roome where he was, he could not but thinke; This man hath long thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted for my blood, and now hee comes to fetch it; I ſhall not liue to ſee the ſucceſſe of <hi>Eſther,</hi> or the fatall day of my nation: It was knowne that morning in the
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:3839:270"/>
Court, what a lofty gibbet <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> had prouided for <hi>Mordecai;</hi> and why might it not haue comne to <hi>Mordecaies</hi> eare? What could he therefore now imagine other, then that he was called out to that execution? But, when he ſaw the royall robe that <hi>Haman</hi> brought to him; he thinks, Is it not enough for this man to kill mee, but he muſt mock me too, What an addition is this to the former cruelty? thus to inſult, and play vpon my laſt diſtreſſe? But, when he yet ſaw the royall crowne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be ſet on his head, and the Kings owne horſe richly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, at his gate, and found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe raiſed by Princely hands, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that royall ſeat, he thinks; what may all this meane? Is it the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:3839:270"/>
of mine aduerſary that I ſhal dye in ſtate? Would he haue me hangd in triumph? At laſt, when hee ſees ſuch a traine of <hi>Perſian</hi> Peeres attending him, with a graue reuerence; and heares <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> proclaime before him, <hi>Thus ſhall it bee done to the man whom the King delighteth to honour;</hi> finding this pompe to be ſerious, &amp; well meant, hee imagines (in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood) that this inexpected cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge proceeds from the ſuit of his <hi>Eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her;</hi> now, he begins to lift vp his head, and to hope well of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his people, and could not but ſay within himſelfe, that he had not faſted for nothing. O the wondrous alteration that one morning hath made in the court of <hi>Perſia;</hi> he that was yeſternight
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:3839:271"/>
deſpiſed by <hi>Hamans</hi> footmen, is now waited on by <hi>Haman,</hi> and all his fellow-Princes; Hee that yeſter-night had the homage of all knees but one, and was ready to burſt for the lacke of that, now doth obeyſance to that one, by whom hee was wilfully neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; It was not <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> that wrought this ſtrange mutation, it was the ouer-ruling power of the Almighty, whoſe immediate ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d would thus preuent <hi>Eſthers</hi> ſuit, that he might challenge all the thanke to himſelfe. Whiles Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue their owne wills, they muſt doe his; and ſhall either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt, or depreſſe according to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine appointment.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould commend <hi>Hamans</hi> obedience in his humble condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

to ſo vnpleaſing, and harſh a command of his maſter, were it not, that either he durſt doe no other, or that hee thus ſtoopt for an aduantage. It is a thankleſſe reſpect that is either forced, or for ends: True ſubiection is free and abſolute; out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of duty, not out of feares, or hopes.</p>
                     <p>All <hi>Shuſhan</hi> is in an amaze at this ſudden glory of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies how to reconcile this day with the thirteenth of <hi>Adar; Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi> had reaſon to hope well; It could not ſtand with the honour of the King, to kill him whom he ſaw cauſe to aduance; neither could this be any other, then the beginning of a durable promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; otherwiſe, what recompence

                     <p>With a couered head, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected countenance, doth hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten home, and longs to impart his griefe, where he had receiued his aduice: It was but cold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that hee finds from his wife
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:3839:272"/>
                        <hi>Zereſh,</hi> and his friends. <hi>If Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai be of the ſeed of the Iewes, before whom thou haſt begunne to fall, thou ſhalt not preuaile againſt him, but ſhalt ſurely fall before him:</hi> Out of the mouth of Pagans, O God, haſt thou ordained ſtrength, that thou maiſt ſtill the enemy, and the auenger. What credit hath thy great name won with theſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous nations, that they can out of all experience make maximes of thine vndoubted protection of thy people, and the certaine ruine of their aduerſaries? Men finde no difference in themſelues; the face of a <hi>Iew</hi> lookes ſo like other mens, that <hi>Eſther</hi> and <hi>Mordecai</hi> were not (of long) taken for what they were: He that made them, makes the diſtinction betwixt

them; ſo as a <hi>Iew</hi> may fall before a <hi>Perſian,</hi> &amp; get vp, and preuaile; but if a <hi>Perſian</hi> (or whoſoeuer of the <hi>Gentiles)</hi> begin to fall before a <hi>Iew,</hi> he can neither ſtay, nor riſe: There is an inuiſible hand of om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency that ſtrikes in for his owne, and confounds their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites.

                     <p>Beſides, now it appeares the King was abuſed by miſ-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; the aduerſary ſuggeſted that the life of the <hi>Iewes</hi> could not ſtand with the Kings profit; whereas their very bondage ſhould bee more damage to the ſtate, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all <hi>Hamans</hi> worth could counteruaile. Truth may bee ſmothered, but it cannot dye; it may be diſguiſed, but it will bee knowne; it may bee ſuppreſſed, but it will triumph.</p>

                        <pb n="536" facs="tcp:3839:278"/>
But what ſhall wee ſay to ſo harſh an aggrauation? Could <hi>Eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her</hi> haue beene ſilent in a caſe of decreed bondage; who is now ſo vehement in a caſe of death? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, to a generous nature, death is farre more eaſie then bondage; why would ſhe haue indured the greater, and yet ſo abhorres the leſſe? Was it for that the <hi>Iewes</hi> were already too well inured to captiuity; and thoſe euils are more tolerable wherewith wee are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted: Or, was it, for that there may be hopes in bondage, none in death? Surely, either of them were lamentable, and ſuch as might deſerue her humbleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation.</p>
                     <p>The Queene was going on, to haue ſaid, But, alas, nothing
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:3839:278"/>
will ſatisfie our bloody enemie, ſaue the vtter extirpation of mee, and my nation; when the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient rage of the King interrupts her ſentence in the midſt, and (as if he had heard too much already, and could too eaſily ſupply the reſidue of her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint) ſnatches the word out of her mouth, with a furious demand; <hi>Who is he, and where is he that durſt preſume in his heart to doe ſo?</hi> It was the intereſt of Queene <hi>Eſthers</hi> perſon that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this ſtorme in <hi>Ahaſuerus;</hi> ſet that aſide, how quietly, how me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily was the determined maſſacre of the <hi>Iewes</hi> formerly digeſted?

                     <p>Now Queene <hi>Eſther</hi> muſters

vp her inward forces, and with an vndaunted courage, fixing her angry eyes vpon that hated <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gite,</hi> ſhee ſaies, <hi>The aduerſary, and enemy is this wicked Haman.</hi> The word was loath to come forth, but it ſtrikes home at the laſt. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer till now did <hi>Haman</hi> heare his true title; Before ſome had ſtiled him, noble; others great; ſome, magnificent, and ſome perhaps, vertuous; onely <hi>Eſther</hi> giues him his owne, wicked <hi>Haman;</hi> Ill-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing greatneſſe doth in vaine promiſe to it ſelfe a perpetuitie of applauſe: If our waies be foule, the time ſhall come, when after all vaine flattery, after all our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentanie glory, our ſins ſhall be ript vp; and our iniquities laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs to our vtter confuſion.
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:3839:279"/>
With what conſternation did <hi>Haman</hi> now ſtand? How doe we thinke he lookt to heare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thus enſtyled, thus accuſed, yea, thus condemned? Certainly, death was in his face, and horror in euery of his ioynts; no ſenſe, no limme knowes his office: Faine would he ſpeake, but his tongue falters, and his lips tremble; faine would he make apologies vpon his knees, but his hart failes him; and tells him the euidence is too great, and the offence aboue all pardon: Onely guiltineſſe, and feare look through his eyes vpon the enraged countenance of his maſter; which now bodes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him but reuenge, and death.</p>
                     <p>In what a paſſionate diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:3839:280"/>
doth this banquet ſhut vp? King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> flyes from the table, as if hee had beene hurried away with a tempeſt. His wrath is too great to come forth at his mouth; onely his eye tels <hi>Haman</hi> that he hates to ſee him, &amp; vowes to ſee his diſpatch: For ſolitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and not for pleaſure, doth hee now walke into his garden; and thinkes with himſelfe; What a monſter haue I fauoured? Is it poſſible that ſo much cruelty and preſumption ſhould harbour in a breſt that I thought ingenuous? Could I bee ſo bewitched as to paſſe ſo bloody a decree? Is my credulity thus abuſed by the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous ſubtilty of a miſcreant whom I truſted? I confeſſe it was my weake raſhneſſe to yeeld
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:3839:280"/>
vnto ſo prodigious a motion, but it was the villany of this <hi>Agagite,</hi> to circumuent me by falſe ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions; He ſhall pay for my error; the world ſhall ſee, that as I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in grace, ſo I wil not come ſhort in iuſtice. <hi>Haman,</hi> thy guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty blood ſhall expiate that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood, which thy malice might haue ſhed.</p>
                     <p>In the meane time, <hi>Haman,</hi> ſo ſoone as euer he could recouer the qualme of his aſtoniſhment, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe left alone with Queene <hi>Eſther,</hi> looſeth no time, ſpareth no breath to mitigate her anger, which had made way to his deſtruction.

his danger, imploring her mercy, confeſſing the vniuſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his malice, profering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauors of ſatisfaction: Wretched man that I am, I am condemned before I ſpeake, and when I haue ſpoken, I am condemned: Vpon thy ſentence, O Queene, I ſee death awaits for me, in vaine ſhall I ſeeke to auoid it; It is thy will that I ſhould periſh; but let that little breath I haue left, acquit me ſo farre with thee, as to call heauen and earth to record, that in regard of thee, I dye innocent: It is true that mine impetuous malice miſcarried me againſt the nation of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> for the ſake of one ſtubborne offender; but did I know there was the leaſt drop of Iſraelitiſh blood in thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:3839:281"/>
perſon? could I ſuſpect that <hi>Mordecai,</hi> or that people, did ought concerne thee? Let not one death be enough for me if I would euer haue entertained any thought of euill againſt nation, or man, that ſhould haue coſt but a frowne from thee: All the court of <hi>Perſia</hi> can ſufficiently witneſſe how I haue magnified and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thee, euer ſince the royall crowne was ſet on thy head; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I euer faile to doe thee all good offices vnto that my Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Maſter, whom thou haſt now mortally incenſed againſt me.

Whiles hee vvas ſpeaking to this purpoſe, hauing proſtrate himſelfe (for the more humilitie) before the queene, and ſpread his armes in a vehement imploration vp to her bed; the King comes in, and, as not vnwilling to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrue the poſture of him, vvhom he now hated, ſaies, <hi>what, will hee force the Queene alſo before me in the houſe?</hi> That vvhich <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> meant as an humble ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, is interpreted as from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous offender; How oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>might he haue done ſo, and more, vvhiles he vvas in fauour, vncen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured? Actions are not the ſame vvhen the man alters. As charity makes a good ſenſe of doubtfull occurrents, ſo preiudice and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure takes all things (though

well-meant) at the vvorſt. It is an eaſie thing to picke a quarrell, vvhere vve intend a miſchiefe.</p>
                     <p>The wrath of the King is as a meſſenger of death: Whiles theſe vvords were yet in the mouth of <hi>Ahaſuerus, Haman,</hi> in turning his head towards the King, is ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly muffled for his execution; he ſhall no more ſee either face, or Sun: he ſhall bee ſeene no more but as a ſpectacle of ſhame, and horror: and now he thinkes, Wo is me whoſe eyes ſerue me onely to foreſee the approch of a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and painfull death! what am I the better to haue been great? O that I had neuer beene, Oh that I could not be: How too truly haue <hi>Zereſh</hi> and my friends foretold me of this heauy deſtiny?
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:3839:283"/>
Now am I ready to feele what it is that I meant to thouſands of innocents; I ſhall dye with paine and ignominie: Oh that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of mine intended murder could die with me. It is no maruel if wicked men find nothing but vtter diſcomforts in their end: rather then faile, their former hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe ſhall ioyne with their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent miſeries, to torment the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is the iuſt iudgement of God that preſumptuous ſinners ſhold be ſwallowed vp of thoſe euills, which they would not feare; Happy is that man, who hath grace to fore-ſee, and auoyd thoſe waies, which will lead him to a perfect confuſion. Happy is hee that hath ſo liued that hee can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther welcome death as a friend,
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:3839:284"/>
or defie it as an enemy.</p>
                     <p>Who was euer the better for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour paſt? thoſe that had before kiſſed the feet, and ſmiled in the face of <hi>Haman,</hi> are now as ready to couer his head, and helpe him to the gallowes. <hi>Harbonah</hi> one of the Chamberlaines, ſeaſonably tells the King how ſtately a gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet <hi>Haman</hi> had newly ſet vp for well-deſeruing <hi>Mordecai,</hi> within his owne palace.</p>
                     <p>I heare not one man open his mouth to intercede for the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to pacifie the King, to excuſe or leſse the fact; euery one is ready to pull him down that is falling, to trample on him that is downe; yet no doubt, there were ſome of theſe Courtiers whom <hi>Haman</hi> had obliged; Had the cauſe been

better, thus it would haue beene. Euery curre is ready to fall vpon the dog that he ſees werryed; But here, it was the iuſt hand of God to ſet off all hearts from a man that had beene ſo vnreaſonably mercileſſe; and to raiſe vp ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (euen among frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds) to him, that had profeſſed enmity to Gods Church: So let thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies periſh, ô Lord, vnſuccored, vnpitied. <hi>Then the King ſaid, hang him thereon:</hi> There can bee no truer iuſtice then in retaliation; who can complaine of his own meaſure: <hi>Behold the wicked tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth</hi>

                     <p>Little ioy would it yet haue been to <hi>Eſther,</hi> that her enemy was dead, her kinſman aduanced, if ſtill her people muſt for all this expect their fatall day: Her next ſuit therfore is for the ſafety of her nation, in the countermand of that bloody decree, which <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
