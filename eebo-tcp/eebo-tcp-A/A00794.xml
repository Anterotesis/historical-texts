            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT concerning the former Catalogue.</head>
            <p>I Would haue thee aduertised (<hi>Gentle Reader</hi>) that in this Catalogue, I haue set downe the Names of all the chiefe Pastours, as being the principall members of the visible Militant Church, with obseruation of the yeare or time, and such order of succession, as I could find in those Authors, which I had at hand.</p>
            <p>Likewise I haue set downe, the names of some few other Professours, liuing in, or neere those seuerall ages, in which I haue placed them: but in this I haue not byn so curious, either to name all which are knowne, or which my selfe know to haue bene; or to set downe any precise yeare, or orderly succession of their being; but haue contented my self to name only a few in euery age, and this without specifying the particuler yeare, in which they flourished, or obseruing any exact order, in which they succeeded one another.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I haue set downe some princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Councells, or Assemblies of the Pastors,
<pb facs="tcp:2261:17"/>
and Doctours of the Church, leauing out many others, which I might haue set downe. The reason why on the one side, I haue set downe these particulers, is, that it may eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare, that the Catholike Roman Church hath bene continually Visible, in euery Age, as the true Church must, and ought to be.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the reason why I haue omitted so many other particulers, is, partly that I may not be too tedious to my Reader; and partly that I may not seeme to exact vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable paynes to be taken by our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saryes, when a like Catalogue shal be required of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of the names of like visible Professours of their Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Church &amp; beliefe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out euery age: which whiles they do not (as indeed they cannot) I may boldly say with old <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iren. l. 1. c. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>That by only bringing forth that Tradition and Religion, which the greatest, and most ancient, and to all men manifest, I say, <hi>the Church of Rome,</hi> founded and erected by the two most glorious Apostles <hi>S. Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Paul,</hi> receiued of them, and by succession of Bishops, hath brought vnto our time; we do counfound all those, which howsoeuer, either by vaine pleasing of themselues, or vaine glory, or by blindnes and peruerse iudgment, do make erroneous decoctions.</p>
            </q>
            <p>And this I may the better vrge, because
<pb facs="tcp:2261:18"/>
(<hi>as the same</hi> Irenaeus <hi>affirmeth</hi>)</p>
            <q>
               <p> there is in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church a more powerfull principality, by reason wherof, it is necessary for euery Church, that is, for all Christians through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole world, to haue recourse vnto it &amp;c.</p>
            </q>
            <p> If any be desyrous to see more of this matter, let him peruse the <hi>Reply</hi> it selfe (out of which this Catalogue is taken) and the <hi>Treatise of Faith,</hi> newly set forth by the same Author.</p>
