            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

After that Ioseph &amp; Mary had deuoutly passed <note place="margin">Exod. 23. 14. 15.</note> the dayes of the feast, &amp; were returned home, it came to passe (not through blind Fortune but by God his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouidence,

By whose euil example rauenous wolues painted Christians, hypocrites haue entered &amp; defiled the sanctuary, spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Christ &amp; his gospel, to the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his flocke.

Come to the ministratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts set forth nowe by common authority after the first institution, they thinke baptisme is not effectuall, because it wanteth mans traditions: They are not taughte how the Apostles baptized.

But there hangeth ouer vs a great euill, if your grace doe not helpe it in time. The diuel goeth about by these Cormorantes that deuour the liuinges appointed for the Gospell, to make a fortresse and Bulwarke, to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14398:19"/>
keepe learned pastors from the flock: that is, so to decay learning, that there shall be none learned to commit the flocke vnto. For by reason liuinges appointed for the ministerie, for the most part, are either robbed of the best parte, or cleane taken away, almoste none hath any zeale or deuotion to put their children to schole, but to learne to write, to make them prenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or else to haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lawyers. Looke vpon the two welles of this Realme, Oxforde and Cambridge, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most dried vp.

may be deliuered from the clawes of the diuell, by sending pastors to their liuinges, the first moneth, &amp; suffering them to haue no cloak of absence, you will soone restore the firste yeares li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, whiche in my conscience was wrongfully taken away at the first, as I suppose, by the Bishop of Rome. But I doubt not, if all were well redressed to this, that this also should soone bee amended. Wherfore here I wil desire god, to assist your grace in the aduance mente of his Gospell, which like vnto Iosias you haue helped to bring to <note place="margin">2.

But yet, it is not heard of all your people, a thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d pulpets in England are couered with dust, some haue not had four sermons these xv. or xvi. years since Friers left their limitations, and a fewe of those were worthie the name of sermons.

And seeing it is so, so many as feele the griefe and smarte of this plague, ought not to murmur against other, but patiently suffer, and be offended with their owne sinnes, whiche haue deserued this scourge &amp; much more: and studie for amendment, that God may take it away. For if they continu as they do, to murmure againste god &amp; their rulers, as the Israelites did, to prouoke daily his anger by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyinge synne in his sighte, with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, malice, deceipt, backbiting, swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe, fornication, &amp; with vtter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his worde, he shall for their punishmente, so multiply the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of euill gouernours, vniust Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Iustices, &amp; officers, that as it was <note place="margin">Vopiscus</note> spoken by a iester in the Emperoure Claudius time, the images of good magistrates may all be grauen in one

But shall wee thinke this to bee very strange: many apply not God his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse nor his wil, which yet would disdain to be, counted ignorant there in. But vndoubtedly, good christians, it is an vnfallible veritie, that negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in perfourming God his will, commeth of ignorance. It is all one to know God and his will, &amp; Sainte Iohn saith plainely, <hi>He that loueth not, knoweth not God.</hi> For if he doe <note place="margin">Ihon. 4. 8.</note>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:14398:35"/>
know God, he cannot but loue him, and loue is alwaies occupied in Gods busines. By this rule Saint Augustine <note place="margin">Augustine.</note> proueth, wee cannot keepe perfectly the first precept, to loue God so well as we ought to doe, while we are in this mortall life: For all our loue commeth of knowledge, but in this life, <hi>ex parte cognoscimus, our knowledge</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 5.</note> 
               <hi>is vnperfect.</hi> And thus S. Augustines rule grounded vppon S. Iohn is true, that so farre as we knowe God, so far doe wee loue him, and so they that loue him nothing at all, they knowe him nothing at all. Althoughe they seeme to haue neuer so much windie knoweledge, puffing vp their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke with presumption, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle sayeth, <hi>scientia inflat, knowledge</hi>

               <hi>maketh a man swell:</hi> So that if a man haue studied the scripture all his lyfe long, &amp; learned the whole Bible by harte, and yet hane no loue, he is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of God his will.

               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:14398:36"/>

So ought wee alwaies to <note place="margin">When Gods word is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned.</note> make our accounte to haue learned Gods worde, when wee haue learned charitie &amp; obedience.
