         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>TIS not unknown to any in our <hi>Engliſh Iſrael,</hi> that there are yet
here amongſt us ſome Remainders of the Men of 42. and that the
Diſeaſe it ſelf ſticks as cloſe to Them, and particularly to ſome
eminent Parts of the Nation where they skul, and for the preſent
where they make their Refuge (for in the Countries they are more eaſily
diſcovered) as the Leproſie did under the Law to the very Walls of
the Houſe; and it ſeems to be as hardly removed as that Levitical
Diſtemper, which ſome Naturaliſts and Phyſitians ſay cannot be
done but only by Blood, and that is the thing which their fingers itch
to be at again, Witneſs their late Rebellious Commotions in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
which had they taken effect, there would not have been wanting
theſe who would have juſtified them: Nay, I ſpeak what I know,
and have heard, did excuſe them, as a poor People Oppreſt; and <hi>You
know Oppreſſion makes a Wiſe man Mad,</hi> eſpecially at this time
of the year, the <hi>Seaſon being a little Hot.</hi> I muſt confeſs I am no
ſtranger to the Men or their ways, having been for many Years
laſt paſt, a ſtrict Obſerver of them, though I thank God I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
and do ſtill from my Heart, Abhor and Detest any Confar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reation
with them, or any the leaſt Approbation of their Actings or
Principles; for <hi>I</hi> have diſcovered ſo much of ill Nature, Cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
Covetuouſneſs, Self-ſeeking, and want of Charity in this
ſort of Men, that it did always give me a great ſuſpition that
their Cauſe was Evil; eſpecially reflecting upon the Means which they
made uſe of to carry on their pretended Reformation, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The
throwing down of Epiſcopacy, a Government of Gods Church, as
Antient in this Nation as Chriſtianity it ſelf; the takeing away,
and Aboliſhing the beſt of Liturgies either Ancient or Modern, a
juſtified taking up of Arms againſt their Native Soveraign, <hi>the
Lords Annointed,</hi> to whom, and to whoſe Anceſtors they and their
Fore-fathers had Sworn Allegiance: the Plundering and Deveſting
of the Kings moſt faithfull Subjects of their Goods, Eſtates and
<pb facs="tcp:40986:3"/>
for their dutiful adherence to the beſt of Kings who ever raign'd in
this our Iſle. And laſtly the embrewing their Violent, Rebellious, and
Wicked hands in His moſt Sacred Blood; a courſe which the Moral
Heathen would Blaſh to take, to ſave his Country ready to be Loſt and
Ruined, and yet theſe men in a Bad Cauſe to pretend Conſcience and
Religion, which hereto fore Conquered the Heathen World, not by reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
though they were able and wanted not Numbers to do it, but by
their Sufferings; for theſe Men <hi>I</hi> ſay to pretend Conſcience and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<hi>Clament Melicerta Periſſe Frontem de rebus.</hi> Theſe are the
Men <hi>I</hi> Confeſs againſt whom the following Diſcourſe is aim'd: For <hi>I</hi>
very well know that it lies not in the Power or Wit of theſe, though
they gladly would and do flatter themſelves perhaps in this their Folly
that they may be able to Cajole any Perſons of Loyal Hearts or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
to take part with, or appear againſt the Biſhops in the preſent
Controverſie: No, Gentlemen believe it, you ſmell too ſtrong, and
you are too well known, and <hi>I</hi> can never believe the contrary, till <hi>I</hi>
ſee you perſwade them to carry in once more their Plate to <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Honour of the Prieſthood aſſerted by the Law of Nature and Levitical Law; the Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities
thereof under Primitive Chriſtianity. The returns of Gratitude to God for the

               </argument>
               <p>REligion a thing ſo Excellent, (that to be careleſs in it, or neglectful
of it, is accounted a great diſreputation and ſhame to any Party or
Perſon) hath ever had ſince there were Profeſſors of it, and that is
ſo long as there have been men in the World, a ſelect number of
Perſons, who have been the Miniſters of it. Theſe men dureing
the firſt times, and the Adminiſtration of the Law of Nature, were the Firſt
Born, and they both Princes and Prieſts too; ſo that the Adminiſtration of Juſtice,
and the Performance of Religious Worſhip we find then to have been linked
together in one and the ſame Perſon, <hi>Adam, Seth, Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and other the
<hi>Antediluvian</hi> Patriarchs were in their Order and Succeſſion both Kings and Prieſts
alſo; as any perſon may be ſatisfied, if he will peruſe thoſe Writers of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Antiquities <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Joſephus:</hi> Afterwards, when the Law was given by poſitive
Precepts to the Sons of men, one of the Twelve Tribes <hi>(viz.)</hi> that of <hi>Levi</hi> had
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40986:4"/>
the Prieſthood annexed to it, together with other great Immunities, Honours and
Priviledges, and in the diviſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> (if Mr. <hi>Seldens</hi> Authority may
ſway any, <hi>Rev. Hiſt. Tithes, c. 2.)</hi> they of <hi>Levi</hi> had near three times the Annual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
of the largeſt among them, they had their Places and Voices in their <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drims</hi>
and Councils: yea and Cognizance of <hi>Capital Cauſes</hi> alſo, as we may find large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proved by the Learned <hi>Spelman</hi> in his Hiſtory of Sacriledge; What ſenſe the very
Heathens themſelves had of the Honours of their Prieſthood, it would be very
tedious to relate. The Prieſthood was not eſteemed any ſhame to him that bore
the Scepter and wore the Crown. In <hi>Egypt</hi> as Sr. <hi>John Marſham</hi> in his <hi>Cronic.
Canon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ad. Sec. 1.</note> well obſerves thoſe Ancient Kings after the Flood <hi>Thoth,</hi> or <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius,

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Nay in the firſt Ages of the World, the Legiſlative and Executive
Power went along with the Prieſthood, <hi>Melchizedeck, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> after the
Flood, as well as the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> Patriarchs were as well Executors as makers of
Laws. Let us peruſe the Holy Records, and we find <hi>David</hi> a King and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſeſt of mortal men, ſtileing himſelf by the name of
the <hi>Preacher</hi> and valuing himſelf more upon that name, then upon the ſcore of
his other Royal Titles; and in the fullneſs of time Jeſus Chriſt himſelf the <hi>King
of Kings,</hi> the Eternal Son of God and <hi>Original of all Power</hi> thought it not below him
telling us expreſly <hi>Luke 4. 18.</hi> That he was ſent into the World on no other end

never went about to dipoſſeſs either the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Governours in <hi>Judaea;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did his Diſciples ever go about to do any thing like it; yet when the Empire
became Chriſtians, the Prudent Piety of the firſt and moſt Chriſtian Emperors
for the better Encouragement of Religion and Learning, conferred large Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and Exemptions upon Church-men, freeing them from Subſidies, Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and ſundry ſervices wherewith other of their Subjects were burdened<note n="*" place="margin">Euſeb. Ecc. Hiſt. 10. c. 7. Zom. l. 1. c. 9.</note>
                  <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Zozomen,</hi> record ſeveral Priviledges granted by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi>
That thoſe who Miniſter in Holy Religion be wholly
free and exempt from all publick Burthens: And ſome have
very well obſerved, that during the continuance of the gift of Tongues, extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Learning, and other Miraculous effuſions of Gods Holy Spirit upon the
Primitive Church, there were no need of the Piety and Charity which ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Chriſtian Emperors beſtowed upon the Church, the Apoſtles had no need
to ſtudy for their Preaching, and therefore had leiſure enough to fiſh and make
Tents for a livelihood, whereas ours are forced to pore upon Books, to Meditate,
Write, and all hardly ſufficient to ſearch out the deep Myſteries which coſt Them
no Pains, the Spirit ſupplying the place of all. Therefore to make amends for
all theſe extraordinary qualifications, and abundant meaſure of Spiritual Graces
wherewith they were furniſhed above us, it hath pleaſed the Lord of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
in theſe latter days to raiſe up Chriſtian Magiſtrates to aſſiſt and encourage
his Labourers, and appoint them a more ſetled and plentifull allowance; yea and
honour alſo, and power together with it, for that Wiſdom without theſe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
contemned. Who ever was choſen a Magiſtrate in our Neighbour State
of <hi>Holland,</hi> or here at home? who had not Riches, and therefore Honour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them, Wiſdom in the eſteem of the Vulgar is always thought to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with Riches and Power: So that the pretences of thoſe men who for a
Cloak to their Innovations and Sacriledges, vainly vaunt that all things ſhould
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40986:4"/>
be brought back to the Primitive Purity, and the Clergy alſo to the Apoſtles Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
ſeem to argue thus much that they are no farther true Goſpel Miniſters,
and the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles than they are able to work Miracles, and that
they though not enabled to it by any Education may be required to work in any
of thoſe Callings of which the Apoſtles were, whoſe Succeſſors they pretend to
be. We read in <hi>Lud. Vives</hi> in his Commentary upon St. <hi>Auſt. de Civitate Dei,</hi> That
the Prieſts of <hi>Ceres</hi> [no other than the Mendicants amongſt them of <hi>Rome]</hi>
were to renounce the World and Riches and Honour too; and therefore that on
the day of their Initiation they were to put on a Coat which they never left off
till ſuch time as it was ſo ragged that it would no longer hang to their backs; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
if Spiritual Perſons were left to ſome mens allowance, this would be their
Portion from them to be clad with Poverty, Contempt, and Rags, and their
Callings as well as their Neceſſities would conſtrain them to <hi>Faſt and Pray.</hi> I
know ſome men (particularly <hi>Luther)</hi> amongſt our Reformers have ſleighted Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and that Portion due to their Callings, out of ſincere Principles and a good
meaning, who have yet lived to Repent their Error, though not able to redreſs
it, when they have ſeen how much the Church has thereby ſuffered, and Religion
been damnified, Witneſs <hi>Luther Epiſt.</hi> p. 131. <hi>Ego per meo ſtipendio annuo tantum

                  <p>The Clergy under the Law and Goſpel alſo, have ingaged in Secular Cauſes, and the State very
happy in this their Adminiſtration in the Primitive times of the Goſpel proved from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples

<hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf was a Prieſt as well as a Ruler; and he appointed Prieſts dureing
the <hi>Levitical</hi> Adminiſtration to be Overſeers of all things, Judges of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
and Puniſhment of Malefactors, <hi>Joſeph. lib. 2. cont. App.</hi> who ſaw the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
reduced to practice, tells us the thing in fact was ſo. Who hath not heard
that <hi>Ely</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> the Lords Prieſts were at the ſame time Civil Judges in
<hi>Iſrael. Chytraeus</hi> makes three Conſiſtories amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> of all which the
Prieſts were the Principal and Eſſential Members: (1.) A Triumvirat in every
City wherein many matters and lighter Treſpaſſes was decided; theſe <hi>Grotius</hi>
calls <hi>Pedaneos Judices.</hi> (2) The little <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> Conſiſting of 23, wherein Capital
Cauſes were determined in the Gate of every City. (3.) The Council of State
or grand Senate of 70 Elders, which ſome make to conſiſt of 71, taking in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi>
others in 72. Six out of each Tribe, the High Prieſt being commonly of
the Number. Now that the Prieſts and <hi>Levites</hi> were part of this great
<hi>Sanhedrim,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exerc. 13. c. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Cauſabon</hi> will bear me out; who makes it appear
out of their beſt Authors, <hi>quod hujus Concilii ea fuit inſtitutio ut ſi fieri posſit
e Solis Levitis &amp; Sacerdotibus conſtaret,</hi> That as near as might be, the endeavour
was it might conſiſt only of Prieſts and <hi>Levites;</hi> whence <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Philo</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
under the Title of Prieſts underſtand the <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi> Come we down to
<hi>David</hi> whoſe Government was a Pattern to all his Succeſſors, his Reign was peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and flowriſhing; nor did he want States-men of the moſt raiſed abilities for
his employments: Yet did not this Wiſe, this Holy Prince think it inconſiſtent
with the Sacred Function (which yet St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us in ſome reſpects <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſius
Miniſterium</hi> than that of the Goſpel) to engage <hi>Levites</hi> in his weightieſt ſecular
Charges. For we find <hi>Hathaliah</hi> and his Brethren appointed Officers on this
ſide <hi>Jordan,</hi> not only in the buſineſs of the Lord, but <hi>in the Service of the King:</hi>
And <hi>Jerijah</hi> another in Holy Orders is made Plenipotentiary or Ruler over the <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benites,</hi>
the <hi>Gadites,</hi> and the half Tribe of <hi>Manaſſah</hi> in every matter pertaining to
God, and in <hi>the affairs of the King likewiſe, 1 Chron. 26. 30. 32.</hi> Nor was he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
in it, but was Imitated by good <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> who made the Prieſts and the
<hi>Levites</hi> Judges of all the Controverſies in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not excluding <hi>matters of Blood,
2 Chron. 19. 8, 10.</hi> Now run over the Catalogue of all the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and
were any to be paralled with theſe? I am ſure that none went beyond theſe, none
whoſe Government did more proſper with Righteouſneſs, Juſtice, and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
And though under the reſt of the Kings we have no expreſs mention of
the ſame practice; yet all things conſidered, we have more reaſon to conclude it
held than the contrary, for we find <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the Prieſt chief Counſellour to <hi>Joaſh,
2 King. 11.</hi> And if we look into after times at the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40986:5"/>
Prieſts command all and poſſeſs the Scepter for ſome Hundred of years, for the
<hi>Aſſamonaean,</hi> Race continued abſolute Princes till <hi>Pompeys</hi> Conqueſt, <hi>Joſeph. l. 13. c.

Cognizance, as the Inquiſition for Murther, falſe Witneſs, <hi>&amp;c. Deut. 21.</hi>
And yet after all, the Preachers of the Goſpel do not hence draw arguments that
they are chiefly and ſolely to be inſtructed with theſe great and Important Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
but I do on their behalf averr, and will be ready to prove and maintain,
That a fit allowance being made to the difference of Times and Perſons; the
model preſcribed by God himſelf under this <hi>Levitical</hi> Adminiſtration may ſafely be
followed now in ſome things, and thoſe no Circumſtantials alſo.</p>
               <p>But leaving <hi>Moſes,</hi> let us come to Chriſt, and ſee how matters ſtood under the
Goſpel, here though we have no inſtances of Honours conferr'd by our Saviour
upon his Apoſtles, yet have we Propheſies, that after the publication thereof
Kings ſhould become the Nurſing Fathers of it, and that the feet of thoſe that
brought the glad tydings of Peace ſhould be Beautiful upon the Mountains, which
Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> applyeth to the Bounty and Munificence of Princes to the Church, <hi>Iſa.
49.</hi> But for the firſt 300 years, What could rationally be expected from the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

               <p>But no ſooner was <hi>Gentiliſm</hi> aboliſh'd, but we have a new and ſmiling face of
Affairs under the happy Reign of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Churches great Patron, as well as
the Clergies Friend. And henceforth the Primitive Piety was not wanting, who
thought no Honours or Powers miſplaced upon their Spiritual Fathers, for whom
they judged nothing too dear. All Hiſtories ring of <hi>Conſtantines</hi> kindneſs to his
Clergy, by whom the moſt weighty Affairs of his Empire dureing his time was
moſt happily tranſacted, and that moſt of his Succeſſors wrote after his Copy
will appear by what follows; for it were very eaſie to muſter a little Army of
Fathers engaged in Secular Employments. We read <hi>Zozomen l. 6. c. 32.</hi> that

I find that <hi>John Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was accuſtomed to ſit twice a Week and
Judge between thoſe that were at variance, and to reconcile them, and once
when none came to him, he departed weeping, That all that day he had done
no good, but <hi>Sophronius</hi> replyed, That he had more cauſe of rejoycing than
of Weeping; for having brought the City to ſuch good Order, and to ſo great
Peace, that they were more like Angels than men, having no differences left,
but were all in friendſhip and amity. <hi>A rare Example to the Immortal Fame of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Judge.</hi> We all remember that Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> commanded it to be ſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up as a wonder, That he had once been able to clear the <hi>High Court of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery
from Suites, and not one cauſe to remain unheard:</hi> But here we have a Populous
City (hardly ſhort of any in our Nation) by the pains of a good Biſhop, <hi>without

But wee will paſs over ſuch obſcure Names, whom it were endleſs to reckon

ſaith he was every day ſollicited to make up ſome breaches about Gold, Silver,
Land, Cattel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet where have we found a more Faithfull and Aſſiduous
Preacher and Paſtor than this good father? Were any more engaged in conteſts
with Hereticks, or any that left a larger Legacy of his Learned Labours to the
Church? I dare challenge any before or ſince the Churches Reformation, who
have done the like, and who will ſay that the good Father had miſpent his time,
that had better been laid out in <hi>painfull Preaching</hi> to his flock? Whereas we all
know that Preaching is but a very ſmall part of the Miniſters Calling, yet of
late times it hath been made by ſome to ſwallow up the reſt of the Miniſters
Duties as neceſſary and Eſſential to his Callings as that can be; and have obſerved
alſo, that ſome Miniſters themſelves, otherwiſe good men, have been a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to themſelves and the Church, in complying too much with a ſort of men
amongſt us, whoſe intereſt it is to draw all Cauſes into their own Courts for the
ſupport of their own Grandeur and Faculty; whereas otherwiſe thoſe Suites and
Cauſes might perhaps with little or no charge have been more ſpeedily, yea and
ſatisfactorily determined. Our laſt inſtance ſhall be in <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, <hi>de Cur.

adds that, <hi>Et ſi cogamur terrenis negotiis intendere, mens tamen noſtra ſaeculari va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietate
non delectatur, ſed tota in unum currit, atque confluit finem.</hi> Though he was
forced to do this for the good of his People, yet he took no Pleaſure in it, and
his mind was taken up with better things, for all agree that theſe muſt not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
out of love to them, but Chriſtian Charity and Compaſſion to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
<hi>Aug. de Civ. Dei l. 19. c. 19.</hi> Now theſe Imployments were conferred
upon thoſe Fathers not as Biſhops but as Subjects more Eminently qualified than

Learning. But Three there are (in which they did Principally engage) and
which may ſeem moſt agreeable to their Coat: Firſt, <hi>To be in the Commisſion of
Peace;</hi> and to ſpeak Impartially, Who fitter for ſuch a Work than they, whoſe
buſineſs and Calling it is to reconcile thoſe that are at variance: And this was the
deſign of the Ancients, though at firſt it began in a way of Charity; yet being
found profitable, it was upon mature Deliberation by the Chriſtian Emperors
confirmed, particularly by <hi>Conſtantine, Zozom. lib. 1. c. 9.</hi> who leaves it free to any,

Tribunal if either party did require it, though the other denyed his conſent,
and their appeal was to be obeyed by the Magiſtrates whenever made, though

did a little retrench this unlimitted power, yet ſtill allowing it by the joint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

in Capit. l. 6. c. 28.</hi> What the practiſe was in our own Country of <hi>England</hi> ſhall
God willing be made out in what follows, wherein I doubt not but to give abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
ſatisfaction of the <hi>Factum</hi> that the Clergy were employed as much as the
Laity in the Deciſion of Secular Cauſes, ſo far as we have good Authority and
Record in the times of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and ſo downwards till our late and unhappy
Diviſions 1640, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which God grant may be ever buryed in Oblivion, and that
we may never live to ſee the ſame again. Secondly, To be of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
where frequently Caſes of Conſciences relating to State-matters may ariſe:
As ſuppoſe there be a Conſultation about a War or Marriage, the Lawfulneſs or
Unlawfulneſs thereof, muſt be judged <hi>in foro Conſcientiae,</hi> and ſo is the proper
Subject of a Divine or Clergyman; and perhaps the thing will not bear ſo much
<hi>delay,</hi> as to Summons Prelates together for Advice nor Reaſon of State to be ſo
much publiſhed, for want of ſuch Knowing and Religious Counſellours, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
may often be entangled in unjuſt Maſſacres, and raſh Wars, and Innocent
Blood be ſpilt, which otherwiſe might have been prevented: And for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof the Godly Prudent Princes both of our own and other Nations
have ever admitted ſome ſpiritual Perſons to their Counſel Tables, and Cloſet
Debates. To the good advice of Biſhop <hi>Fox</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> we owe the Union of the
two Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> for the other Privy Counſellors advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th to Marry the Eldeſt of his Daughters to <hi>France,</hi> the more
Noble and Rich Kingdom: the old and wiſe Biſhop adviſeth his Majeſty the
contrary, at which the King ſeeming ſomewhat ſurpriz'd, the Biſhop gave him
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40986:7"/>
this as the reaſon of his Opinion, that by Marrying the Elder to <hi>Scotland,</hi> that
Kingdom would be brought to <hi>England,</hi> and old Enmities reconciled and for ever
buryed: Whereas on the contrary <hi>England</hi> being under <hi>France,</hi> we ſhould have
here been ruled by a <hi>French</hi> Liuetenant of Deputy, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> he doubted
would hardly brook, and perhaps our Government and Laws by reaſon of their
unagreeableneſs to the <hi>French,</hi> might have been attempted to have been changed
into thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> man (his Opinion was) would hardly
bear: Whereas thoſe of <hi>Scotland</hi> were not ſo much differing from the Laws
and Cuſtomes of <hi>England,</hi> and twas to be hoped the two Nations would better
accord together than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> would. The good event of which
Counſel we have ſeen with our own Eyes, and may it long continue. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> that he would not in any wiſe diſpenſe with the abſence of
his Biſhops from him, who had he lived in our Prophane age, the Churches E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
would have ſaid that the good Emperour had been Prieſt ridden, a well-meaning
man but not overwiſe: But the good Emperors joy it was to ſee <hi>His
Court to be as it were a Church.</hi> Nay ſo much uſe of theſe Holy men he made, that
he made them follow him in his journeys and warlike Expeditions, <hi>Euſeb. de vit.
ejus l. 1. c. 35. Idem l. 4. c. 56.</hi> So that we read in <hi>Peter Bleſenſis Ep. 84. ad Alex.
3.</hi> how he proves at large there, That it is not only lawfull but very expedient
for Prelates to be in the Courts and Counſels of Princes upon ſuch like impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
reaſons as thoſe are, and therein excuſes the Biſhops of <hi>Wincheſter, Ely,</hi>
and <hi>Norwich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, To be employed in Treaties and Negotiations of Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
and this both the Ancient and Modern practiſe will juſtifie, that none
have been more frequently or more ſucceſsfully uſed and employed in ſuch Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
than the Ambaſſadours of Chriſt: Solemn Embaſſies cannot be expected
before the Magiſtrate embraced the Goſpel. But in the very beginning of the
4th Century we have <hi>Maruthas</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Moſopotamia</hi> ſent Embaſſador from the
Emperor of <hi>Rome</hi> to the King of <hi>Perſia, Socrat. l. 7. c. 8.</hi> Preſently after <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorick</hi>
diſpatcht <hi>Epiphanius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ticinum</hi> or <hi>Pavia</hi> to <hi>Gunebald</hi> King of the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundians,
Eunoch. Tiſin, vit. Epiphan.</hi> who at his requeſt releaſed great numbers of
poor Chriſtian Captives. Then we have St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſent by <hi>Valentinian</hi> to <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus</hi>
that commanded the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Armys, to deſire Peace, which he happily effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the great contentment of his Maſter, <hi>Ambroſ. Ep. 27. l. 5.</hi> where he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
an other Embaſſy wherein he was imployed. I might add St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>
imployed to treat with <hi>Gainas</hi> as <hi>Baronius</hi> informs us. <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned
by <hi>Theodorick</hi> to <hi>Juſtine</hi> the Emperor, <hi>Niſeph.</hi> with multitudes of others
in latter times, whereof if I ſhould give inſtance ſome perhaps would reply upon
me that thoſe were times of Popery and Ignorance; yet perhaps of more candid
ſimplicity and honeſty than the times wherein we live; and for the Moderns
the time would fail me to ſpeak of our own and Neighbour Nations; for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
the Univerſal practiſe of Chriſtendome <hi>till Sincerity gave place to Hypocriſie,</hi>
and that new Definition of an Embaſſadour came up, that he was, <hi>Vir peregre
miſſus ad ſpetioſe mentiendum Reipub. cauſa.</hi> A good man ſent abroad to tell ſpecious
lies for his Countries ſervice. <hi>Then indeed it was high time for theſe Holy men to reſign
up theſe Employements to others whoſe Education and courſe of Life better became
them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we have ſeen both Ancient and Modern Uſage on the Clergys ſide, the
uninterrupted practiſe of the World for above 5000 years before and under the

               <p>This then being the <hi>Factum</hi> or uſance as is Evident, let us a little in the next

a Publick Agent, there being none more likely to prevail in ſuch an Embaſie
than himſelf; and the little Commonwealth otherwiſe would be in danger to
be loſt. In this caſe ſhould he be heard pleading the inconſiſtency of his Holy
Profeſſion with ſuch an imployment, and thereupon return a denyal; if ſo,
then the Magiſtrate will be an ill condition, who muſt be obeyed in nothing
more than the others Calling enjoins him whether commanded or no, and his
being a ſpiritual Perſon will make the Civil Magiſtrate looſe the ſervice and uſe
of his Subject: A thing yet which the moſt eminent amongſt them have not
declined; for that neither Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> formerly in the one, nor Mr. <hi>Henderſon</hi> of
later times in the other, have not ſcrupled greater matters.</p>
               <p>But let matters be made never ſo clear, it may be feared that the Vulgar have
taken up ſuch prejudices from the inexcuſeable buſineſs of ſome late Preachers
here amongſt us intereſting their very Pulpits in State matters dureing our late
Troubles (a practiſe never ſufficiently to be condemn'd) that all perhaps may be
bound to their good Behaviour for a while for the Miſcarriages of theſe men,
who have been ſo notoriouſly guilty of the ſuppoſed crime, they have been
guilty of in their Preaching againſt it, and chargeing it upon other men, who
never (as they did) engaged in any thing of that nature, but when they were
commanded to it by the Magiſtrate: Though 'tis hoped that all learned and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

by lawfull Authority, and not take an advantage from the miſcarriages of
this other ſort of men to bring an irreparable injury on Poſterity by debarring
others more ſober than they. It is a true ſaying and confirmed by the experience
of many hundred of years. <hi>Laici ſunt ſemper inimici Clero.</hi> When the World was <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi>
the Devil taught the multitude to cry out if any publick Calamity hapens,
that the Chriſtians were in the fault, and they muſt to the Lyons: but now the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Sophiſter hath changed his note, and if any thing be amiſs either in Church
or State, preſently the blame muſt be caſt upon the Clergy; They muſt be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40986:8"/>
to appeaſe the many-headed Multitude, their Lands Sequeſtred or Sold,
and all places of Honour and Truſt interdicted them; certain we are, the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
of a Biſhops Calling do not in the leaſt incapacitate him ſuch employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as we have been ſpeaking of: For (1.) 'tis required that he be <hi>Vitae Probatisſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae,</hi>
of an upright unblameable Converſation. (2.) <hi>Nullius Criminis reus.</hi> (3.)
<hi>Aetate gravis,</hi> well ſtricken in years. (4.) <hi>Doctrina praeſtans,</hi> excelling in Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
with many other of the like nature. Now if theſe are not kept, they
have the more to anſwer for whom it concerns, if they be obſerved, will not
any one who reads this, conclude no Perſons more fit than they for the moſt
weighty Affairs? For all Polititians make Integrity, Prudence, and Learning the
Principal ingredients of an accompliſht Magiſtrate; ſo that if Aptitude be
reſpected, we may ſafely affirm there are none better qualified for Counſel than
the Clergy, whoſe Education and Inſtitution hath enabled them to look into all
the Idaeas and Models of Government; to ſearch the Depths and Myſteries of
Empires, moſt of which are lockt up in ſtrange Languages, and 'tis not every
capacity that can gain the Key. Then for true Politicks (the late <hi>Florentine</hi>'s Reaches
let other men learn and admire) there's as much to be found in the Hiſtorical
part of the Scripture, as in any Books in the World, ſo that Divines may in all
probability make good Statiſts. And is it not pitty then that their Countrys
ſhould be deprived of ſuch hopefull and eminent abilities? doubtleſs thoſe of the
contrary Opinion do not throughly weigh the conſequences of their Aſſertion,
clearly leading to disjoin the Church from being a part of the Commonwealth,
which for 1300 years and better have been happily united; if the Biſhops and
other Spiritual Perſons who yet by their Revenue are ſo conſiderable in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
muſt no longer be lookt upon as Citizens, or parts of it, and <hi>eo ipſo</hi>
be debarred from Employments, but incontinently forfeit all their Priviledges as
ſuch, the conſequence I preſume would not be very good.</p>

to put on Blew Aprons, and make them ſuch ſordid allowances, that they muſt
either work with their hands or ſtarve, ſeeing it is not comely that the Lords
Warriours ſhould buſie themſelves about inferiour matters that tend to get a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood,
and ſo <hi>Valla</hi> render it, not <hi>negotiis</hi> but <hi>negotiationibus,</hi> when our Saviour em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
Fiſhermen to Preach his Goſpel, weak inſtruments to confound the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of this World, though he furniſhed them with ſuitable abilities that they
needed not to ſtudy, yet he made them leave their nets, and not uſe them as their
ordinary Profeſſion. But laſtly, and moſt ſatisfactorily, the Apoſtle here makes a
compariſon between Prophane and Spiritual Warfare, and therefore the better
to underſtand the genuine ſenſe we muſt conſider what Military Diſcipline did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
<hi>Veg. l. 2.</hi> ſays that by the Laws of War he muſt not have any private
affairs committed to him, nor mind his own gain. Hence we read in <hi>Florus</hi> of
the <hi>Romans</hi> ſeverely proceeding againſt <hi>Poſthumius</hi> for imploying his Soldiers to till
the ground, <hi>Vid. Leg. Arcad. &amp; Honorii Tit. Miles.</hi> And <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperor ſays
expreſly, thoſe that are armed and maintained by the Commonwealth muſt only
mind publick affairs, and not till the ground, keep Cattel, or Traffick, <hi>L. Mil.
C. de re Militari l. 12.</hi> All avocations were inhibited, and ſuch matters as tended
only to the publick good enjoyned them, and why then ſhould not the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy
hold here, and ſuch affairs be permitted to the Clergy, as tend to the good
of the Church, and the Glory of their great Commander.</p>
               <p>Next we are urged by the Apoſtles practice who were ſo tender of any interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that they denied to attend upon tables, and make proviſion for the Poor. 'Tis
true, in the infancy of the Church, when the Goſpel was to be publiſhed all the
World over, the Work great, and the Labourers exceeding few, the leaſt diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
at ſuch a time would prove a conſiderable hindrance and deſtraction to them.
But now when the Lord of the Harveſt has encreaſt the number, and plentifully
furniſhed his peaceable ſettled Church, every Village being now ſupplied, and
if the complaints of ſome be true, the Nation ſo overſtock'd, that there's hardly
employment, much leſs maintenance for the Multitude. In this caſe to make
no difference of times, when the mercifull Providence of God hath made ſo vaſt
a diſtinction ſeems little agreeable to reaſon. But if from this, occaſion muſt be
taken preſently to forbid every petty interruption and diſturbance; how came
St. <hi>Paul</hi> to contradict himſelf, and to follow his Tent making, labouring with
his hands for a livelihood, which muſt needs take up a good part of his time, and
hinder his Praying and Preaching. Add to this, that the ſeven Deacons appointed
by the Apoſtles to ſucceed them in the care of the Collections, were according
to <hi>Epiphanius</hi> of the number of the 70 Diſciples, and yet for the publick benefit,
their conſtant Preaching was now and then diſpenced with to attend on Tables.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:40986:9"/>
Thirdly, They argue from the Canons of the Primitive Church, prohibiting
Clergy men to judge and intermeddle in Civil Matters, or any Cauſes Secular;
the Prohibitions of this ſort are many and various, they may be ſeen in <hi>Balſamon,
Zonarus, Binias, &amp;c.</hi> It would be an infinite task to give particular anſwers to each
Canon, and therefore I ſhall lay down ſome general Rules, which may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
conduce to the underſtanding of them all, which if well applyed will make an
abundant ſolution to that ſo complicated an Objection.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot but admire the Modeſty of the Primitive Church, and the
Charity of the People the earneſtneſs of Princes in Commiſſioning of Spiritual
Perſons to compoſe all emergent differences, and the forwardneſs of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in flying to the Tribunals for Juſtice, whereupon the Holy Fathers in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of time to take off their Clergy from thoſe Affairs made ſundry and ſevere Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
in divers Counſels, and therefore (1.) 'Tis clear, the great deſign was to
forbid ambitious ſeeking after, and voluntary engageing in Secular matters for
Sordid ends, and out of Covetous Principles, and this may probably be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
becauſe we find a diſpenſation given when impoſed by the ſupreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.
In the Counſel of <hi>Sardis</hi> tis granted upon the motion of <hi>Oſius, Si religioſi
imparatoris literis vel invitati vel vocati fuerint,</hi> and undertaken in obedience as cauſes
of Piety and Charity, overſeeing Widdows and Orphans, provided it extended
not to the notorious neglect of their Religious Callings. And thus <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>
calls the Biſhop the great Steward of all the poor, <hi>Apol. 2.</hi> the Contributions of
the Faithfull being laid down at his feet, and by him diſtributed. And <hi>Ignatius
Ep. ad Polycarp.</hi> calls the Biſhop the great Truſtee of the Widdows. (2) 'Tis not
a total prohibition, but only a prudent reſtraint, leaſt animoſities and jealouſies
ſhould ariſe in the Laity, by too much encroaching upon their Courts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the wiſdom of ſundry Counſels confin'd the Clergy to ſuch matters as were
properly of Eccleſiaſtical Cognizance.</p>
               <p>But (3.) The ground and reaſon of theſe interdictions was not the unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and incapacity of ſpiritual Perſons, but out of reſpect to their eminent Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
leaſt they ſhould be diſparaged by mean and vile employments, and expreſs
mention is made of ſordid Offices about Princes and Noble men, as of Stewards,
Bailiffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when by the favour of Princes their employments were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
and their temporary diverſions did bring abundant recompence to the
Church; we find thoſe that had the principal hadn in enacting theſe Canons
themſelves engageing. Now can it be ſuppoſed, if this had been the meaning,
they would have been guilty of ſo great a contradiction, and no future Counſel
reprove it. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> much confirms me in this Opinion, <hi>l. de Lapſis,</hi> is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that God ſent the great Perſecution under <hi>Decius</hi> onely to awaken the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who were growing exceeding corrupt, eſpecially the Clergy; for he there
complains that the Biſhops themſelves abandoned their holy Functions, and dealt
in matters of the World, haunting Marts and Fairs for filthy lucre ſake. And much
to ſame purpoſe we find in Writers of our own Country, as <hi>Gildas, Bede,</hi> &amp;c.
But to make peace between quarrelling Nations, to compound differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Chriſtians, and ſuch like, tending to the honour of God and the Glory of
the Goſpel, which may be often practiſed without detriment to their Spiritual
charges, I never find theſe expreſly forbidden, or ſuch as engaged in them, as
<hi>Cyprian, Auſtin, Chryſoſtom, Gregory, Bernard,</hi> &amp;c. Condemned; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
all things to all men to gain a Soul: Will not the example bear his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
out, if they go to the utmoſt verge of their Chriſtian Liberty, ſtill keeping
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40986:9"/>
on this ſide ſin, to preſerve Kingdoms, the Churches Peace, and to prevent the
effuſion of Chriſtian Blood, their abſence ſome days from their private charges
will be abundantly recompenced by ſuch happy conſequences.</p>

                  <p>The Ancient Eſtate of the Clergy and Prieſts in this and other Kingdoms.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE have before intimated that the Prudent Piety of the firſt Chriſtian
Emperours, for the better Encouragement of Religion and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
did confer many and great Priviledges and exemptions upon
their Clergy in thoſe Primitive times. Come we now to manifeſt that the <hi>Franchiſe,</hi>
of our <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Church, were neither ſhort for number or extent, and that they a reall
confirmed by <hi>Magna Charta</hi> without reſtraint, the words are <hi>we have granted</hi> to God;
and by this our preſent Charter confirmed and for our Heirs for ever, that the
Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhall be free, and have all her whole Rights and Liberties invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable,
all the Nation being content to ſtand accurſed if this grant were at any time
infringed. You may ſee in Ancient Authors the manner of its Publication <hi>(viz.)</hi>
The King, Prelates, and Peers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> came with burning Tapers in their hands,
throwing them down on the ground, and ſaying, ſo let his light be extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the other World, which ſhall go about to break this Charter and Agreement,
yea more if any thing ſhould be done againſt it and contrary to it, it was <hi>ipſo
facto</hi> declared void, 26. <hi>Edw. 1. c.</hi> 2. And muſt <hi>Magna Charta</hi> be violated only
when the Clergys Priviledges are invaded, Why ſhall it not ſtand firm and
good for them, and on their behalfs, as for the Laity? Did not the Clergy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as much as any for the Procurement of it? Nay were they not they who
procured it from the ſeveral and reſpective Kings? Let us deſire the Enemies of the
Clergy to ſee their own Cronicles, and they ſhall receive ſatisfaction. Now what
the Liberties of the Church were, to ſet them down would ask a Volume; the
Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Cooke</hi> ſays expreſly, they had more and greater than other of
the Kings Subjects, ſome few he recites, as that they were diſcharged from Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances,
Tolls, Cuſtoms, Diſtreſſes by the Sheriff in the old inheritance of the
Church, with others of the like nature. It might fetch tears from ſome to look
back upon the Piety and Charity of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Anceſtors who in their greateſt
impoſitions ever held their Eccleſiaſticks excuſed, no part of that inſupportable
Tax of <hi>Danegelt,</hi> under which the Kingdom ſo much groaned, being ever paid
by them, <hi>Vid. Spelm. Gloſſ. in Danegelt.</hi> and it may be made appear that till after
the Conqueſt (the tenure of their Lands being at that time <hi>Frank Almoigne)</hi> they
were ever priviledged. For King <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> in a full Convention of his States at
<hi>Wincheſter, Ann. Dom. 858.</hi> Enacted that Tithes and Church Lands throughout
all his Dominions ſhould be free from Civil Burdens and Exactions, as much as
Royal Tributes great and ſmall, <hi>Vid. Spelm. Concil. ad Annum dictum.</hi> But dureing
our late inteſtine Wars, How unequal were Quarterings and Contributions?
What heavy Burthens did the poor Clergy bear, no redreſs being found to their
bittereſt complaints from the Lay Judges, who in ſome places made ſport at their
Miſeries and Oppreſſions, as if nothing had been too hard or inſupportable for
their ſhoulders; now thoſe days through Mercy are over, and muſt be forgotten,
to receive almoſt in all places the ſame hard meaſure from their pretended well-wiſhers,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40986:10"/>
                  <hi>This ſtrikes to the very heart.</hi> When no regard is had of all their paſt
ſufferings; Firſt-fruits, Tenths, (no ſmall ſtanding revenue of the Crown, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting
as ſome compute to near 40000 <hi>l. per annum</hi>) which they joyfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
but they muſt ſtill be left to the arbitrary diſproportionate Impoſitions of
every Domineering inſolent Officer: The conſideration hereof hath convinced
many (formerly of a different perſwaſion) that 'tis not only uſefull but expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
yea neceſſary for the Church, to have ſome of his own Ordering Power to
protect them, and to hear and redreſs their juſt grievances. But what further
concerns the Clergys Priviledges and juſt Rights, being ſo learnedly handled by
the Immortal <hi>Spelman;</hi> and the general ones ſo fully Collected by <hi>Rebuffus de Stud.
Priv.</hi> and others, I ſhall not here any further enlarge upon them. The grand concern
at preſent, and which we principally deſign is, how far they were Priviledged as to
publick Aſſemblies and State Conſultations. And that the Holy <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and
many other famous Kings and Emperours have made uſe of their advice both at
Home and Abroad, employed them in Embaſſies and other important Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
hath been already demonſtrated. And here in the firſt place, if ſuch an
argument could hope to ſway with us Chriſtians, it would ſoon be proved that
thoſe who attended the Worſhip of the Heathen gods were admitted in <hi>Greece,</hi>
the then moſt knowing and civilized part of the World, into their <hi>Pan-Aetolium</hi>
and <hi>Amphyctionian</hi> Counſels. Amongſt the <hi>Athenian Areopagites</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Senators,
and that the Old <hi>Gauls</hi> divided their ſtates in <hi>Druidas</hi> (who had <hi>omnium rerum immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatem)
Equites, Plebem,</hi> as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> before did into Prieſts, Soldiers and Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
But leaving <hi>Gentiliſme</hi> we will haſten to Chriſtendome: And here once
for all, deſire our Reader to conſider, that by the fundamental Conſtitutions of
the moſt and beſt ſettled Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> there are three States generally ſettled
whereof the Clergy is ever one: Now to make this good, though we might
produce variety of inſtances, yet we ſhall content our ſelves with the ſingle
Teſtimony of <hi>Calvin</hi> alone, knowing that it will go farther with ſome, than a Jury
of others, This we find expreſly aſſerted in his Inſtitutions, <hi>l. 4. c. 20. Sect. 31. In
ſingulis regnis tres ſunt ordines,</hi> &amp;c. which how to make up without the Spiritualty
will be hard and beyond my skill. In our Neighbour Nation of <hi>France</hi> the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
is notoriouſly known, the ancient ſtile of the Royal Edicts always running,
as 'tis Recorded of <hi>Pepin, Ann. 744. Per Conſilium Sacerdotum &amp; Optimatum ordinavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
Per Conſilium Sacerdotum &amp; optimatum ordinavit Carolamanus, Thuanus pasſim.</hi> It
might farther be noted that ſix Prelates are here Pairee of that great and famous
Kingdom, three of them being ſtiled Dukes, and three Counts, See <hi>Seldens
Titles of Honours,</hi> and yet the whole number of the Pairee exceeds not Twelve.
As likewiſe the Arch Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> hath a peculiar indulgence in being preſent in
every Court of that Royal City without exception <hi>Chappinus.</hi> Look we into <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi>
where <hi>Thwroczius</hi> informs us that by the Fundamental Conſtitutions of King
<hi>Stephen,</hi> the Biſhops in <hi>Concilio Regis primi adſiſtunt. Poland</hi> comes behind none in
its Reverence and Reſpect for their Clergy, where the Arch Biſhop of <hi>Gneſna</hi> is
<hi>Primas Regni &amp; Princeps primus, Staniſ. Kriſtanowick in diſcrip. Polon.</hi> whoſe juriſdict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
is not limited to the Spirituality alone, but hath the chief place in the Rank of
the Senators aſſigned him, and is of the greateſt Authority in all publick Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
And when at any time there happens an <hi>Interregnum</hi> (as it frequently doth in
thoſe Elective Kingdoms) it belongs to him to ſummon a Dyet to give Audience
to Forreign Embaſſadours, and to appoint a time and place for the Election of a
New King. Our Author farther enlargeth this to have proceeded from the Piety
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40986:10"/>
of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Kings towards the Church, that the Sons of it ſhould for ever hold

omit <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> as being ſuch known vaſſals to the Pope, where the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
Rule the Roaſt. But one word daſhes all this [with ſome] <hi>They are Papiſts,</hi> a
doughty argument to condemn any thing though backed by never ſo ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
And let us examine how matters ſtand with others, <hi>Andreas Bureus</hi> in his
Deſcription of <hi>Sueden,</hi> acknowledges that the Eccleſiaſticks were heretofore the
<hi>Prime men in the Senate,</hi> till the Covetouſneſs of <hi>Guſtavus</hi> the firſt deſpoiled them
of their Revenues: Yet ſince the Reformation, they ſtill to this day retain their
ſuffrages in all Publick Dyets of the Kingdom. And when the New Crowned
King makes choice of his Counſellors, the Arch Biſhop of <hi>Upſal</hi> is ſtill the firſt,
who is allowed a greater proportion of Attendants, when he comes to the King
than any Noble man in the Nation, no fewer than Forty Horſe being permitted
him; whereas the retinue of the other Noble men muſt not exceed Thirty. And
in the great Aſſembly at <hi>Lincopen, Ann. 1600.</hi> we find both Biſhops and other
Eccleſiaſticks. And as to <hi>Denmark, Pontanus</hi> recites Seven Biſhops as the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Nobility, and theſe have their Votes in all Grand Meetings. <hi>Jonas ab
Elvervelt</hi> diſtributes the States of <hi>Holſtein</hi> into three Orders, 1. King and Princes.
2. Prelates. 3. The Families of the Nobles. And he makes the Biſhops of
<hi>Lubeck</hi> and <hi>Slewick</hi> the two <hi>Prime</hi> Peers in all their Dyets. In <hi>Scotland</hi> it is known
that anciently the Biſhops and Prelates were Eſſential Members of the Parliament,
and had their Seats as ours here in <hi>England</hi> on the Right hand of the King: And
in a Parliament held at <hi>Edenborough, Ann. 1597.</hi> a Vote paſſed for reſtoring the
Clergy to their Original Priviledges, as the Third Eſtate in that Kingdom; the
Learned Prince King <hi>James</hi> Condemning that Act of Annexing their Temporali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to the Crown as Vile and Pernitious, <hi>Baſil. Dor. l. 2. p. 43.</hi> Then for <hi>Geneva</hi>
it ſelf, who is ſo much a ſtranger to that Reformation, as to be ignorant what a
ſtroke <hi>Calvin</hi> and others had upon the Senate or grand Counſel, which gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to that complaint of ſome, that they had expelled <hi>One Biſhop and admitted many.</hi>
If remote Countries be to be regarded, amongſt the <hi>Abisſines</hi> the Clergy is <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount</hi>
in Affairs of all natures, and we read in <hi>Damianus a Goes</hi> of <hi>Zaga Zaba</hi> an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian</hi>
Biſhop Viceroy of <hi>Bagana</hi> ſent Embaſſadour to the King of <hi>Portugal, Dreſſ.
Orat.</hi> In <hi>Muſcovy</hi> their ſupreme Convention, which thoſe Inhabitants call <hi>Zabore,</hi>
conſiſts of the great Duke, Twenty Eccleſiaſticks, and as many Nobles, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People being wholly excluded; and when they are met together, the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
and Eccleſiaſticks are always firſt Conſulted, and firſt deliver their Opinion.
I ſhall conclude this Paragraph, onely reminding, that neither the <hi>Pagans</hi> nor <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi>
are ſo inhumane or irreligious, or diſcourteous to their Prieſts as to deny
them this Liberty: For that <hi>Tully</hi> acquaints us that it was the appointment of the
Gods, that the <hi>Roman Pontifices</hi> ſhould not only take care of their Religion, but

Barbarous <hi>Turks</hi> never exclude their. <hi>Mufti,</hi> but allow him free entrance, and
Vote into all their Divans and Counſels; yea the great <hi>Sultan</hi> himſelf ſo Honours
the <hi>Mufti,</hi> that as often as he comes into his Preſence, he riſes from his Seat, and
according to <hi>their mode,</hi> putting his hand to his breaſt, bows his head in token of

               <p>I Might here be very large ſhould I but give the World a brief account of the
Honour which our <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings had for their Clergy, neither was this a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
onely precarious, and by the <hi>Courteſie</hi> (as we ſay) of <hi>England, Sed ipſis confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum

was eſteemed equal in all things <hi>in cenſu pariter Capitis,</hi> to the Lord of the Mannour

than a greater <hi>Thane</hi> which now we call a Baron of the Kingdom. The Biſhop
of no inferiour Rank than the Count or Earl, <hi>Qui integro fruebantur comitatu.</hi> The
Arch Biſhop equal to any Duke, who might happen to be ſet over, and have the
Rule of many Countries; for that ſaith the Learned <hi>Spelman,</hi> in theſe times our
Kings gave always the greateſt reſpect and honour to their Clergy; for that in
their keeping were the Keys of Learning and Knowledge, the Seculars in the mean
time addicting themſelves moſt what to the Wars, ſo that in thoſe times it came to
paſs that the Prieſts mouth was the Oracle of our Common People no leſs than of
the King and Commonwealth; for that they had ever the firſt Place in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitia's
and Aſſemblies, no leſs than in the Kings Courts of Juſtice, and Law
Tribunals in the Kings Palace with the Nobles of his Kingdom in the Counties
with the Comittees and Juſtices of the Counties, in the Sheriffs Courts <hi>[turno
Vicecomites]</hi> together with the Sheriffs, the Biſhops had their Adſeſſors, yea in the
Hundred Courts, they or their Miniſters ſate together, with the Lord of the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred:</hi>
ſo that one ſword was ever helpfull to the other in the Adminiſtration of
Juſtice, and nothing of moment was done in theſe Courts of Judgment, but by
their advice and aſſiſtance, <hi>Spelm. l. prius citat.</hi> The practice of the Kingdom ran
parallel with the Law; for in all Antient Charters and Laws which heretofore
were paſſed and made by ſigning their names <hi>cum ſigno crucis,</hi> the Spiritual Lords
ever preceeded the Temporal. In a donation of <hi>Ethelbert, A. D. 605.</hi> to the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the firſt witneſs ſubſcribing it, is <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Biſhop, and
after him ſeveral Dukes and Earls, <hi>Monaſt. Angl. &amp; Spelm. Conc. pasſim.</hi> In a Charter of
King <hi>Inas, Ann. Dom. 725.</hi> To the Monaſtery of <hi>Glaſſenbury,</hi> after the Biſhops,

Peers in the Nation putting their Names. Not long after in a Grant of King
<hi>Offus</hi> to the Abby of <hi>Worceſter, Ann. Dom. 708. Brotdran, Berthand, Eadbald,</hi> and
<hi>Eadbald,</hi> two Princes, and two Dukes, follows the Biſhops. And at the ſame

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40986:11"/>
other Nobles give place to the Prelates. And to make an end, in a Charter
of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor to the Monaſtery of <hi>Wincheſter;</hi> immediately
after the King ſubſcribed <hi>Plegmund</hi> and <hi>Fritheſtan</hi> the Biſhops, being followed by

                     </gap>f</hi> and <hi>Heerferth</hi> Dukes, many more of this nature might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
out of the ſame Authors, and others, as ſtanding monuments of the Clergies
Reputation, and the Reverence our Religious Anceſtors bare to their Functions,
particularly the third Charter of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor of the Foundation of
the Abby of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where more particularly we find <hi>Oſberne</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> two
of the ſaid Kings Chaplains, ſigning the Charter before ſeveral of the Earls.
And furthermore, here is Statute Law in the Caſe that this uſage may not be
thought to proceed meerly from the Curteſie of <hi>England,</hi> 'tis confirm'd by the
Statute of the 31 <hi>Hen. 8. c.</hi> 10. Wherein all degrees and offices are placed in
Aſſemblies and Conferences, and there the Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> as <hi>primus
Par regni</hi> the firſt Peer of the Kingdom is ranked before all the Nobility, and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the Kings right hand, next and immediately after the Royal Blood, and
the Vicegerent, and the reſt of the Biſhops follow him in their due precedency,
according to the Dignities and Aunciencies of their reſpective Sees. See farther,
the Statute of 8. of <hi>Eliz. c. 1.</hi> where in that Statute they are called an high, and
one of the greateſt Eſtates of the Kingdom, nor were they ever excluded from
the greateſt Employments of Honours and Truſt in the Kingdom, and to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that this is not ſpoke without Book, we will ſubjoin a Catalogue of
Churchmen Collected out of <hi>Godwin, Malmesbury, Spelman, Dugdale,</hi> and others,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> that have born all, at leaſt the moſt honourable Offices of State, and (how
ever beſpatter'd by ſome) diſcharged them with much integrity and repute; <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
owing more of its happineſs to men of this Calling than any other, though
it cannot be denyed but ſome miſcarriages might be here and there found, and
yet as few as can be expected in ſuch a Multitude: and if a man were diſpoſed
to find fault, he might without much pains takeing two for one in Critically
examining any other Profeſſion. Let us begin then with <hi>Englands</hi> Metropolitan,
to whom this Primacy juſtly appertains, and take the reſt in Order, onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
this, that tis true indeed we find fewer of this See upon the Civil Stage
than any other, moſt Offices being lookt upon as below the Archiepiſcopal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,

                  <p>I might here add ſeveral Deans and Arch-Deacons promoted to the ſame and

of Abbies and Monaſteries, the Prior of <hi>Chriſt Church</hi> in <hi>London</hi> was ever a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Court of Aldermen; and that the Dean of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> is by his Charter
allowed no ſmall intereſt in the Government of that Neighbouring City. But I
ſhall not nauſeate the Reader any longer with the repetition of any more antient
names, but obſerve (as others have done before me) that in the Catalogue of
Chancellors Recorded in <hi>Spelmans Gloſſery,</hi> amounting to about 170, near a 100
of them were Clergymen, more than all the other Profeſſions put together can
make up.</p>
                  <p>Theſe then are the Honours which (if any humane Teſtimony can make a
thing certain by an uninterrupted Cuſtome (equal to Law) which Wiſe Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the beſt of times gave them, through all the <hi>Saxon, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> times,
without Controul and Diſpute till within theſe 40 years or thereabout, ſince which
<hi>England</hi> hath groaned under the very great ſin of Diſpiſeing the Embaſſadors of
Chriſt, and with ſome <hi>it hath been no ſmall ſtep to preferment to rail at them, to murmure at,
and decry their advancements for ſecular ends of their own, yea to rank the great Truſtees of Souls
with the vileſt Peaſants in the Nation;</hi> as if there were no better way to ſhew their
Love to their Redeemer, and their own Chriſtianity, than by hatred to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
who conveyed it to them; as if men had no other way to manifeſt their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
to the <hi>Majeſty of the great God, but by powring out contempt and obloquy upon thoſe
who repreſent his Perſon.</hi> And thus <hi>Corah</hi> and his accomplices great complaint and
grievance againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> was, That they were too high, took too much
upon them, <hi>Numb. 16.</hi> They were advanced and honoured above the reſt, this was
the main Eye-ſore, but the revengeing hand of God would not then bear it. Nay
have we not here in <hi>England</hi> dureing our late and unhappy troubles, heard ſuch
Language as this (nay have we not ſeen the thing reduced into practiſe?) <hi>All the
Congregation is Holy, and one may Preach as well as another:</hi> Thus would theſe Sons of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40986:14"/>
Confuſion have brought upon us a <hi>Munſter Confuſion and Diſorder,</hi> by taking away
the <hi>Diſtinctions of Callings.</hi> The Wiſe God (we know) appointed it otherwiſe
under the Old Teſtament, when every one we know was not admitted to the
Prieſthood. We cannot but think, that there were 1000 in <hi>Iſrael</hi> who knew <hi>how
to kill, ſlay, and dreſs a Sheep, Ox, or Goat, as artificially as the Sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>yet none ever
attempted it in reference to the Altar without a ſevere rebuke.</hi> And was <hi>Moſes</hi> a more
Prudent <hi>Lawgiver</hi> or <hi>Steward</hi> of Gods houſe than Jeſus Chriſt <hi>the Wiſdom of
the Father?</hi> Would it be fuffered in humane Societies, in any well regulated
Corporation that every man who ſhould conceive himſelf fitter to diſcharge
an Office, manage a Trade, Husband an Eſtate, ſhould preſently exclude
another legally poſſeſt of it, and invade his propertys? grant this, and farewell
Government, and welcome <hi>Babel.</hi> Let me ſay it once for all, '<hi>tis folly for any
to expect the proſperity of the Nation,</hi> whilſt the Clergy of it is in Miſery, a Low
and Deſpicable Condition, whilſt the ſacred Function is depoſed, nay with
black ingratitude revil'd; to whoſe learned labours do we owe the Tranſlation of
our Bibles, and who, (as before once was intimated) under God were the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Inſtruments of delivering us from that <hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkneſs our Forefathers ſate
in: Is not this like the Deer we Read of in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who browſed on that Buſh in a
Calm he was glad to creep under in a Storm? Certainly they are not worthy the
Name of Chriſtians or Friends of the Goſpel (whatever their pretences may be)
that deſpiſe and vilifie the Miniſtry, than which, nothing more beſpeaks a vile and
reprobate Heart. We all know that under the Law preſumptuouſly to riſe againſt
the Prieſt was puniſhable with no leſs than Death, <hi>Deut. 17.</hi> for theſe are the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
of the King of Heaven, and how ſacred ſuch perſons were eſteemed by
the Laws of all Nations, all Hiſtories do abundantly Witneſs: 'twas the ſhame
of our Neighbour Nation of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Murder of the late learned Prelate
there, and that ſmall indignities offered to perſons of his Rank have been highly
reſented; the <hi>Ammonites</hi> are a laſting teſtimony in the days of King <hi>David,</hi>

if we inſtance in but one ſingle one, as more eminent and glorious than the reſt
<hi>(viz.)</hi> Their Admiſſion to all Publick Debates and Aſſemblies. Such were (1)
their <hi>Scire Gemotis,</hi> which <hi>Spelman</hi> and other Learned Antiquaries reſemble to our
Country Courts, and Sheriffs turn in which all cauſes both Criminal and Civil,
concerning Church or State were handled; the perſons bound to be preſent were
the Sheriff, the Biſhop and all the Nobles of the County; till at laſt upon their
humble Petition in Parliament, the Clergy were diſpenſed with by the Statute of
<hi>Marleborough, 52 Edw. 3.</hi> unleſs urgent neceſſity required it. Secondly, their
<hi>Folk Gemotts</hi> a kind of Annual Parliament commonly held in the beginning of
<hi>May,</hi> in which the Princes of the Kingdom, Biſhops, and Magiſtrates, and the
Laity took the Oath of Allegiance, and confirmed their mutual Union before the
Biſhops. The Original of this is intimated to be as high as King <hi>Arthur, Vid.
Leg. Edw. Confeſſ. 35.</hi> Thirdly, their <hi>Wittena Gemotts,</hi> or <hi>Michel Synoth,</hi> the grand
Convention of their Wiſe men. Theſe who deſires to look farther into, may have
recourſe to <hi>Spelmans</hi> laborious Gloſſary, <hi>V. Gemot.</hi> Now out of none of theſe were
the Clergy excluded, but ever reckoned an eminent and principal part of each,
their Counſels Votes and Approbation demanded and given before any Laws
were conſtituted.</p>
               <p>For Proof of this, we ſhall look back above 1000 years to the Laws of King
<hi>Ethelbert,</hi> and the Authors we ſhall produce, and on whoſe Authority we lean
are <hi>Bede, Spelman,</hi> and <hi>Lambard.</hi> And as to King <hi>Ethelbert</hi> preſently after the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk here in <hi>England,</hi> we find as <hi>Spelman</hi> hath it in <hi>Spelm. Conc.
126.</hi> The King to have called a grand Aſſemby, <hi>A. 605. Tam cleri quam populi.</hi>
In the Laws of King <hi>Ina,</hi> which <hi>Florentius Wigornienſis</hi> dates, <hi>Ann. Dom. 686.
Spelm. 692. Lambert 712.</hi> we find theſe Laws were made and wrote by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
and advice of his Biſhops <hi>Hedda</hi> and <hi>Erkenwald;</hi> and though the Learned
<hi>Spelman</hi> Excerps out of the body of thoſe Laws only thoſe which more particularly
relate to the Church, as being only proper for this deſign, yet <hi>Lambard</hi> mentions
many Civil matters there determined. And when the great League and Union
between the <hi>Britons, Saxons</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> was concluded, we find it Ratified <hi>per Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
Concilium &amp; aſſenſium omnium Epiſcoporum, Procerum, Comitum &amp; omnium ſapientum

Laws in Parliament now uſed in <hi>England, Bed. Eccleſ. Hiſtor. l. 1.</hi> In the Laws
of King <hi>Athelſtan</hi> about the year 924. <hi>(Spelm. 922)</hi> there's no mention of any other
Counſellors for the enacting, though certainly the form was the ſame, but his
<hi>Arch Biſhop Ufhelme</hi> and his other Biſhops, and theſe were at leaſt the prime perſons
there, though the Body of the Laws concern ſecular affairs. <hi>Spelman</hi> ſelecting
only Eccleſiaſtical, yet in the Title he owns others paſſed. In the Laws of <hi>K.
Edmund</hi> about 946. the King had a full meeting of Eccleſiaſticks, and Laicks at
<hi>London,</hi> in which were preſent <hi>Odo</hi> and <hi>Wulstan</hi> the Arch Biſhops, none of the reſt
though without doubt there preſent once named. Again 948. to a great Convention
of the Eſtates at <hi>London</hi> under <hi>Edred,</hi> Writs of Summons are iſſued out to the <hi>Arch
Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and yet their <hi>agitur de negotiis Regni, Ingulph. p. 87. Spel. Conc.</hi>
p. 428. Come we to the <hi>Danes, 1021.</hi> we find a Publick Aſſembly called at
<hi>Wincheſter</hi> by <hi>Canutus,</hi> where were preſent <hi>Wulſtan</hi> and <hi>Adelholme</hi> the Arch Biſhops
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40986:15"/>
with other Biſhops Dukes and Earls, <hi>&amp;c. Spelm. Conc. p. 534.</hi> Now dureing
theſe two Periods theres no mention of Baronies, but all the Churches tenure was
in <hi>Pura Eleemoſyna, Frank Almoigne</hi> and the Biſhops ſate onely as eminent Prelates
by vertue of their Spiritual Dignities; for there being hardly any Laws but ſome
way or other concerning Religion, and the good of Souls: therefore in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
of them the Cergy was ever required by our Prudent Anceſtors. Thus
much for the Grand Aſſemblys, ſtiled uſually by the Learned Knight Sir <hi>Henry
Spelman Pan Anglica</hi> and <hi>Pan Britanica.</hi> We will only mention the Private Statute
of King <hi>Edgar</hi> which was thus, <hi>ex omni comitatu bis quotannis conventus agitur cui

but the Biſhop was joyned in Commiſſion with the Aarlderman, nay he expreſly
affirms the ſame Titles of Honour, <hi>l. 2. c. 5.</hi> Hitherto of the <hi>Britiſh, Saxon, Daniſh</hi>
Governments, paſs we down to the <hi>Normans,</hi> and here we have King <hi>William</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
with an Oath ratifying the Laws of St. <hi>Edw.</hi> the Confeſſor, and this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
is added. <hi>Si quis ſanctae Eccleſiae pacem infregerit Epiſcoporum eſt Juſtitia, Lambard,

London, quam ſit anima mea in die Judicii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here now at laſt we come to that great change in the State Eccleſiaſtick,
the Biſhops who had ever enjoyed the privileges of <hi>Majores Thani</hi> among the
<hi>Saxons</hi> are tranſlated to Barons, which gave occaſion to that groundleſs error of
ſome, to date the firſt ſitting in Parliament hence, as if the Conquerour to
curry favour with the Clergy, and the better to ſettle his new gotten <hi>Kingdom,</hi>
confered this Honour upon them; But certainly if there were truth in this,
the Clergy are much to blaim, and very ungrateful to their Patron <hi>K. Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>
for that we find them looſers by his favours, and looked upon their
Condition under him much worſe than before, and all the Writers of that Age
muſt be corrected for repreſenting him, as a perfect Enemy of the Church. To
clear up this we will only give you one Inſtance, cited from an Old Record, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,
<hi>Liber Sancti Albani.</hi> Where we read this Paſſage of <hi>Frederick</hi> the then Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> that to obſtruct the March of the Conquerour, he cauſed all
the Trees round to be cut, and laid them croſs the ways, wherewith the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour
being ſtopt in his march ſent in ſome paſſion for the Abbot, who under
his ſecurity coming to him, the Conquerour demands the Reaſon for the cutting
down the Woods, the Abbot reſolutely anſwers him, that I have done, but what
became me, and if all the <hi>Spiritual Perſons</hi> through the Kingdom had uſed their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
againſt thee, as they might and were in duty bound to have done, Thou
wouldſt never have been able to have entered the Land thus far. The Duke then
replying, <hi>Is the Spiritualty of England of ſuch Power? if I live and enjoy that, which
I have gotten, I will make their Power leſs.</hi> Add to this that ſtategem of the <hi>Kentiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
in ſurrounding the King, and forcing him to a Compoſition, which they did
under the Conduct of <hi>Stigand</hi> their Arch-Biſhop, which thing ever after netled
him, and that he was never heartily reconciled to the Church. and proved after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
as good as his word to the <hi>Abbot,</hi> oppreſſing the Clergy all his Reign, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them under Knights-Service, and Ordering how many Souldiers each Biſhop
ſhould maintain for him and his Succeſſors: the Church, as beforeſaid, being ever
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40986:15"/>
free from that bondage. Let no Man then ſay, that the Conqueror (who was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
look'd upon by the Biſhops as their Enemy) did them any <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>
by erecting each <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> into a <hi>Barony,</hi> which thing was ever by the <hi>Biſhops</hi>
look'd upon as a grievance, and a more glorious piece of ſlavery. This was in

firſt, who ſaith, in his <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> that 26 Spiritual perſons ought <hi>ex debito Juſtitiae,</hi>
to have a Writ of Summons ſent them every Parliament. Theſe things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
we will now deſire of the Clergies greateſt adverſary that he would
produce inſtances of any ſolemn meetings, <hi>Wittena gemots</hi> or Parliaments
whereunto the Clergy were not ſummoned; any Statutes publickly enacted
during all the Chriſtian <hi>Britiſh, Saxon, Daniſh,</hi> or <hi>Norman</hi> times, without their
aſſiſtance and advice. As for the precedent of their Excluſion under <hi>Edw. 1.</hi>
at the Parliament held at St. <hi>Edmondsbury,</hi> which ſome triumph in, if there be
any truth in the Narrative (as hath been, and is ſtill, queſtioned) we know,
and can prove, 'twas done in a pett and tranſport of Royal diſpleaſure for their
too obſtinate adhering to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> quarrel, and for
their noncompliance with their Kings demands. Who yet the very next Parliament,
about a year after, makes an Apology for this charging all upon the Exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of his affairs. And why ſhould this ſingle inſtance ſo circumſtantiated be
urged more againſt the Clergy than that other is againſt the Lawyers who
were ſhut out of a Parliament under <hi>Henr.</hi> IV. where we yet find the Biſhops
and amongſt others, <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> ſtoutly reſiſting and preſerving the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
Temporalities, which theſe Church-robbers gaped after, who, ſo they
might <hi>ſpare their own Purſes were content to ſpoil their God to relieve their King.</hi>
Certainly if envy it ſelf could have found the leaſt colour of Law to deny them
this privilege it had never been reſerved for this laſt, and our moſt unhappy
age. Many times have they been ſtruck at, many great blows have they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40986:16"/>
as at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> under <hi>Henr.</hi> II. where their wings were indeed much

               <argument>
                  <p>The Eſtate of the Biſhops and Clergy from the Conqueſt (as to their Voting in Capital

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>VVE have before intimated the common uſages and rights of the
Biſhops to ſit and vote in Parliaments in all antient times, and
that as Peers and Barons of the Realm, we now aver they have
a Power to ſit and vote in all, as well Criminal as otherwiſe, either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
or Proxies lawfully conſtituted, which is a privilege of the Peerage, and
therefore, belongs to the Biſhops as ſuch, 'tis very well known what Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>
hath wrote in his Book of <hi>The Privileges of the Peerage of</hi> England, that the
Biſhops was debarred of their privileges by an Act of Parliament 17 <hi>Car.</hi> I.
<hi>Ann. 1641.</hi> and that he was a great notorious ſtickler in it, but 'tis as notorious
that not long after we find the Commons, nay a ſmall and inconſiderable part
of that Houſe, voting the Temporal Lords uſeleſs and dangerous, and that how
they were enabled by being aſſiſted by the help of <hi>Cromwell</hi> the late Uſurper,
and the Army, to accompliſh what they had begun, and the bad conſequence
of all we have ſeen with our eyes, and Biſhops God be thanked reſtored to
their undoubted Rights and Privileges, and that for as much as they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
Barons (nay the Biſhops had uſually the firſt in Summons) they have
alſo equal privileges to make their Proxies in Parliament as the Temporal Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
had, we confeſs, as before, for that they were Spiritual perſons they were
not by the Council of <hi>Clarendon</hi> to ſit in Capital Cauſes, and loſs of limb, but
then we muſt know that long before this they both had and exerciſed this Power,
as may be made appear out of <hi>John Crampton</hi>'s <hi>Chron.</hi> c. 24. where amongſt the
Laws of <hi>Athelſtane</hi> we read, <hi>Epiſcopo jure pertinet omnem rectitudinem promovere Dei</hi>
(viz.) <hi>&amp; ſaeculi &amp; debent Epiſcopi cum ſaeculi judicibus intereſſe judiciis,</hi> and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of all the Meaſures and Weights is there made of Epiſcopal cognizance
the Standard being ſtill left in the Biſhops hands, and out of Sir <hi>Henry Spelman's
Gloſſary, voce Comes. Comes praeſidebat foro comitatus non ſolus ſed junctus Epiſcopo, ut
alter alteri auxilio eſſet &amp; conſilio, praeſertim Epiſcopus Comiti nam in hunc illi animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertere
ſaepe licuit &amp; errantem cohibere,</hi> ſo much confidence did the Antients repoſe
in the Clergy that the guidance and overſeeing of moſt temporal affairs was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
to them, nay, they had a check upon the Laity. And thus lovingly
with all ſweetneſs and candor for 4 or 500 years, during all the <hi>Saxons</hi> times
and till that unhappy diviſion by the Conquerour, who defaced this beautiful
and regular compoſure did the Church and State-Officers ſit together in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40986:16"/>
morning determining Eccleſiaſtical affairs, and in the afternoon Civil. There
were then no jars or claſhings of juriſdictions heard of, <hi>no prohihitions iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
out of one Court to obſtruct the courſe of Juſtice in another;</hi> thereby hampering the
poor Client that he knew not which way to turn himſelf; and I am perſwaded
there is no better expedient to prevent laſting vexatious ſuits, and to relieve the
oppreſſed, than again to reconcile theſe two juriſdictions, that according to the
primitive uſage as well Spiritual as Temporal Judges may be appointed in
all Courts, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> may not interfere and quarrel, but walk
hand in hand. Though I know this deſign does not relliſh with many of the
<hi>Long Robe,</hi> yet 'tis feared that attempting ſome ſuch thing purchaſed the late
Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> no few enemies and was one eſpecial cauſe of haſtening
his ruine: yet we find Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> a Lawyer too, <hi>lib. 2. de Synedriis,</hi> proving
that for the firſt 4000 years and better the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Courts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
united, and the firſt diſtinction proceeded from Pope <hi>Nicholas, Gratian.
Diſtinct. 96. c. cum ad verum,</hi> and that the Clergy do not meddle perſonally to vote
in loſs of life or limb proceeds from the Canons of the antient Church which
forbad their preſence in caſes of blood, but I hope that no ſober man will
hence argue that they being Barons of this Realm they muſt loſe their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
which belong to the Spiritual Lords as well as to the Temporal; <hi>viz.
To make Proxies though in Capital Cauſes (when by the antient Canons of the Church they
are forbid to be preſent,)</hi> which they have done, and ſtill have right to doe
comes next to be diſcourſed of.</p>
               <p>And (firſt) I ſhall make uſe of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s authority, though no friend
to the Biſhops, (for reaſons he beſt knew of) who expreſsly ſaith in his Book
of the Priviledges of the Barons of <hi>England,</hi> Printed 1642. that <hi>omnes Praelati,
Magnates,</hi> &amp;c. has this Priviledge. <hi>Introduct.</hi> Though he ſays there they had
loſt it by the Parliament 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. 1641. I hope now they are reſtored to it
again, that they had before he gives you ſundry inſtances <hi>Cap. 1.</hi> theſe are
his words § 2. <hi>That the courſe of Elder time was not that Barons onely made Proxies
but other men, as Biſhops, and Parliamentary Abbots, and Priors, who gave their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
uſually to Parſons, Prebendaries, and Canoniſts. In the Parliament of</hi> Carliſle <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

<hi>made</hi> Richard Corqueaux <hi>being then Deane of the Arches,</hi> Thomas Hederſet
<hi>being Archdeacon of</hi> Sudbury <hi>and</hi> John Thorp <hi>Parſon of</hi> Epingham <hi>his Proxies
by the name of</hi> Procuratores ſive Nuntii, <hi>and in the ſame time the Biſhop of</hi> Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham'<hi>s
Proxies were</hi> John Burton <hi>Canon of</hi> Bewdley, <hi>and Maſter of the Rolls and</hi>
John of Wendlingborough <hi>Canon of</hi> London, <hi>and other like in the ſame time. By
which alſo that of the preamble of the Statute of</hi> Praemunire <hi>is underſtood, where it is
ſaid that the advice of the Lords Spiritual that was preſent and of the Procurators of them
that were abſent, was demanded. The like under</hi> Henry <hi>the 4th and 5th, are found in

he there likewiſe tells you, adding withal this unhandſom reflexion, <hi>That the

Precedents wherein they have Voted either Perſonally, or by Proxies in

become their advocate, who ſaith expreſsly <hi>p. 125. lib. cit.</hi> That though
in the Caſe of Appeal of Treaſon in a Parliament of the 11 of <hi>Richard</hi> the
Second, commenced by <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> and others againſt <hi>Alexander</hi>
Archbiſhop of <hi>York, Robert de Vere,</hi> &amp;c. they abſented themſelves, I mean, the
whole Spiritualty in that Parliament, and would make no Proxy in their room
for that time, yet afterwards they agreed to do it in Caſes of Judgments of
Death, <hi>Rot Parl. 2. Henr. 4. &amp; Rot. Parl. 2. Henr. 5.</hi> But he there ſaith, that the firſt
uſe of ſuch Proxies was 21 <hi>Ric. 2.</hi> ſo that we have him confeſſing the Biſhops
ſitting in caſes of blood by their Proxies, the next authority I ſhall make uſe
of, is a Parliament Roll it ſelf, of that year as I find it in Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s
Collections intituled as followeth. <hi>Placita Coronae coram Domino Rege in Parliamento
ſuo apud</hi> Wegmonaſt. <hi>diae Lunae proximae poſt Feſtum Exaltationis Sanctae Crucis Anno
regni Regis</hi> Ric. 2. <hi>Poſt Conqueſtum 21.</hi> The Roll it ſelf you may ſee in the
Tower among the Records there kept. It is of an Impeachment of the Earl
of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Warr.</hi> &amp;c. for Treaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Articles were exhibited againſt
him by ſeveral Lords, as <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Rutland, Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent, John</hi>
Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> &amp;c. which the ſaid Lords were ready to prove the Crimes
objected, and demanded the Priſoner to be brought to the Bar, which the Lord
<hi>Nevil</hi> then Conſtable of the Tower did, and the aforeſaid Lords in their own
Perſons appeared alſo. His Articles being read, the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> Lord
Steward of <hi>England</hi> by the King's commandment, and aſſent of the Lords, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
the whole matter. And thereupon the ſaid Earl's anſwer to the <hi>Articles</hi>
was demanded, who pleaded two Pardons, and prayeth they may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
but they were not, whereupon Sir <hi>Walter Clopton</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of him what he had farther to ſay, for that if nothing more to ſay
the Law would adjudge him guilty. And the ſaid Earl not pleading any thing
elſe, the Lords Appellants in their proper perſons require that Judgment
may be given againſt the ſaid Earl, as Convict of the Treaſon aforeſaid.
<hi>Whereupon the Lord Steward of</hi> England, <hi>by the aſſent of the King, Biſhops and Lords,
adjudged the ſaid Earl Guilty and Convict of all the Articles aforeſaid, and thereby a
Traitor to the King and Realm, and that he ſhould be therefore Hanged, Drawn, and
Quartered, and forfeit all his Lands in fee,</hi> &amp;c. though the Puniſhment, in regard
he was of Noble Blood, was changed, and he was ordered to be Beheaded;
which was done by the Lieutenant of the Tower, and this is a ſhort account
of that Trial for Blood in Parliament. Where 'tis plain and evident that the
Biſhops were there preſent, for 'tis ſaid, <hi>that the ſaid Earl was adjudged Guilty
and Convict by the aſſent of the King, Biſhops and Lords. Q. E. D.</hi> Next we will
produce another Inſtance and Precedent of the Condemnation of <hi>Thomas Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi>
Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who was accuſed by the Commons in full Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
<hi>die &amp; loco praedictis,</hi> where we find the Commons by their Speaker Sir <hi>John
Buſſy</hi> Petitioning the K. in manner following. <hi>For that divers Judgments were hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
undone, for that the Clergy were not preſent, the Commons prayed the King that the Clergy
would appoint ſome to be their common Proctor with ſufficient authority thereunto.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Clergy appoint <hi>Thomas de la Percy</hi> by their Inſtrument their Proctor,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40986:17"/>
who together with the King and the ſaid Lords adjudged him the ſaid Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
guilty of Treaſon, and himſelf a Traitor. The Crimes objected to
him was his traiterous obtaining a Commiſſion from the King, whereby
the Kings Royal Power was encroached, his Subjects put to death without
Royal Aſſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for all which he was found guilty as aforeſaid. What I
obſerve in brief is this, from this Trial.</p>
               <p>(1.) That there had been divers Errors in Judgment, which Judgments were
in Law void, for that the Biſhops were not preſent, (2.) That hereupon the
Commons Petitioned the King that the Biſhops would appoint their Proxy, and
which accordingly they did <hi>Thomas de la Percy.</hi> (3.) He was Condemned by the ſaid
Court wherein ſate <hi>Percy</hi> accordingly. (4.) That the ſaid Biſhops did not Vote there
perſonally, for that the Arch-biſhop their Primate was Arraigned and it might not
be ſeemly for them ſo to do. And here we have the Caſe adjudged, Judgments in
Parliament Revers'd, for that the Biſhops were not Preſent by themſelves or
Proxys, the Commons Petitioning the King that they would make Proxys, a
Judgment obtained for that the Biſhops had made their Proxys. <hi>Q. E. D.</hi> And
if any be not ſatisfied, they may ſee the Roll of Parliament as before, among
the Records in the Tower to which they are Referred. Furthermore to make
another diſcovery of the Inconſtancy of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> I find him in his
<hi>Titles of Honour</hi> in the latter end of his Book, Confeſſing that <hi>Thomas Becket</hi>
Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was Condemned by the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> in Caſe
of High Treaſon, <hi>Vid. Titles of Honour.</hi> And if any perſon would but a little
reflect upon the Reaſon, why the Biſhops have not ſometimes Voted in Caſes of
Blood but by their Proxies? <hi>(viz.)</hi> Their reſpect they had to the Canons of the
Primitive Church, which might give them umbrage for their ſo doing: And toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with this, what hath been ſaid before, of their being frequently appointed
by the King, and acting as Lord Chief Juſtices of <hi>England,</hi> any perſon of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Capacity may gueſs at the Reaſon of their forbearing to Judge in Matters
of Blood for the Reaſon aforeſaid, and their ready and chearfull compliance
with their Princes Command; when by the Law of this Land they were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
ſo to do, and which is a ſufficient <hi>Superſedeas</hi> to the former Canon of the
Church. Another Precedent we have of the Biſhops Perſonally ſitting in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
held at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> on Monday next after the Feaſt of <hi>All Saints,</hi> in the 3d,
of <hi>Hen. 5.</hi> wherein <hi>Henry</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Winton</hi> was Chancellour, wherein was Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and others for Treaſon, for having Levyed men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King, and procured <hi>Edmund</hi> Earl of <hi>March</hi> as Heir to <hi>Rich. 2.</hi> to take
upon him to be King of <hi>England,</hi> and had Proclaimed him ſuch in <hi>Wales,</hi> and ſet
one <hi>Thomas Trompington</hi> an Ideot and <hi>Scotchman</hi> to Perſonate <hi>Rich. 2.</hi> where the
ſaid Earl, and others his adherents in that Action, were Tryed and found Guilty;
the Lords Spiritual in Parliament being Preſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See the Records in the Tower,
<hi>Parl. 3. H. 5. p. 2. M. 4.</hi> Many other Precedents of a later Date and Time might be
here <hi>Ex ſuperabundanti</hi> added, but I ſhall referr them for the matter of another
Chapter, they being all of them taken out of the Journals of the Lords Houſe
beginning in 32 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and ending 29. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 2. I might have enlarged in theſe
which I have taken out of the Tower, but I have purpoſely forborn to do it;
for that I find Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> himſelf in the days of 1642. granting me the
Matter of Fact as clear and evident from the Ancient Records in the Tower, of
the Spiritual Lords Priviledges in this Matter. And will now proceed to another
Argument that the Biſhops have Right to ſit in all Caſes as well Capital as Civil.
For that (4.) they are undoubted Peers of the Realm; which alſo I find Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:40986:18"/>
himſelf granting in his <hi>Priviledges of the Barronage of</hi> England, p. 192. For there
he ſaith, <hi>Though ſome have doubted</hi> (we know whom he means) <hi>whether the Spiritual
Barons are Peers, he ſaith there, that they are ſo, is true and plain, and the Teſtimonies
many &amp; various, as in the Biſhop of</hi> Wincheſter'<hi>s Caſe, who departed from the Parliament
at Salisbury about the beginning of Edw. 3. and was queſtioned for it afterwards in the
Kings Bench he pleaded to the Declaration,</hi> Quod ipſe eſt unus e Paribus Regni &amp; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latus,
<hi>and in that ſhort Diſputation of the Caſe, which is left in the Year Books; he is
ſuppoſed both by the Court and Council to be a Peer.</hi> But for this if his Authority be
not good, the Year Books themſelves may be ſeen. Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſters</hi> Caſe,
<hi>Year Book, 3</hi> of <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> And <hi>Paſ. 3. Edw. 3. coram Rege Rot. 9. Rep.</hi> So afterwards
ſee the Biſhop of <hi>Londons</hi> Caſe in the Year Book, 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. in a Writ of Wards
brought againſt the Biſhop of <hi>London;</hi> he pleaded to Iſſue, and the Defendant
could not have a day of Grace; for he ſaid (as the words of the Books are) <hi>That
a Biſhop is a Peer of the Land,</hi> &amp; <hi>Haec erat cauſa,</hi> Year Book, 3 <hi>Edw. 3. fol. 186.
pl.</hi> 28. And in a like Caſe, an Action of Treſpaſs againſt the Abbot of <hi>Abing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
who was one of the Lords Spiritual, day of Grace was denyed againſt him,
becauſe he was Peer <hi>de la terre, 13 Edw. 3. Titulo Enqueſt.</hi> So expreſly upon a
queſtion of having a Knight returned into a Jury where a Biſhop was Defendant;
the Rule of the Court was that it ought to be ſo, becauſe the Biſhop was a Peer
of the Realm, <hi>Plowden Comment. pl. 117.</hi> So the Judgment given againſt the
Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> in the time of <hi>Rich. 2.</hi> he is in the Roll expreſly allowed to
be a Peer. We find alſo <hi>Stafford</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> upon his being exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Parliament under <hi>Edw. 3,</hi> thus challenging his place, <hi>Ego tanquam major
par Regni poſt Regem vocem habens jurae Eccleſiae meae tantum vendico,</hi> &amp; <hi>ideo ingreſſum in
Parlimentum peto.</hi> The ſame may be made out farther by an Aſſignment of Errors
under <hi>Hen. 5.</hi> for the revearſal of the Attainder of the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> one Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
is Aſſigned that Judgment was given without the Aſſent of the Prelates which
were Peers in Parliament, which is clearly allowed in the Roll and Petition too,
that they were Peers. So alſo in an <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament under the ſame King, <hi>Sta<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 4.
Hen. 5. c. 6.</hi> where the Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops are called Peers of the Kingdom.
But of the truth of this Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> himſelf ſaith, <hi>That no ſcruple could ever be made till
the unhappy Act of the 17 Car. 1641.</hi> And how that <hi>Act</hi> was procured we all know,
How full of tumults and uproars were thoſe Times? to how great a diſtreſs was
Majeſty then brought? How many Repulſes did it meet with? Was it not Paſt
to ſerve the preſent Intereſt? and by what ſubtile contrivance was it at laſt carried
it is very well known? Have we not reckoned the Date of our late Embroilments
and wild Confuſions from this fatal <hi>Apocha?</hi> Under what Miſeries, Violencies,
and Rapins hath not our native Country for 20 years time from hence to be
reckoned, with ſo much pitty from all true-hearted <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> long laboured
and groaned? and the whole Chriſtian-world about us ſtood amazed and agaſht.
All the Wealth which the Piety of our Forefathers had been ſo many years
in heaping up, all their Priviledges which their prudence had ſo deliberately
conferred, being in a few days Paſſion ſwallowed up. Had thoſe good men,
the then Biſhops, unadviſedly acted any thing againſt their Prince or Kingdom,
could no Perſonal-fine or puniſhment expiate their Crime and fault? muſt the
whole Order be raized, and Epiſcopacy it ſelf deſtroyed root and branch?
muſt ſo many merits of their worthy Predeceſſors be buryed in the grave of
ungrateful Oblivion? It were an eaſy matter to produce a large Catalogue
of eminent Prelates, who by their prudent advice have oftentimes prevented
Bloodſhed, preſerved Peace, ſaved a ſinking Kingdom and a dying Religion,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40986:18"/>
many good works have they done amongſt us, many Colledges and Schools
erected and endowed, many material Churches by their munificence, and living
Temples of the Holy Ghoſt built by their Miniſtry; and for which of theſe
muſt they now be thus dealt withal? thus disfranchiſed? That they who here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
carried the principal ſtroke in all Cabinet Counſels and publick Diets,
are acknowledged in ſeveral recorded Statutes of this Kingdom, an high, and
one of the greateſt Eſtates of this Kingdom, as particularly 8 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. that
they are Peers of this Realm, 25 <hi>Edw. 3. c.</hi> 6. before recited, and 4 <hi>Henr. 5.
c.</hi> 6. muſt now be debarred thoſe immunities of which our Nation hath ever
reaped the greateſt benefit, they muſt be curtailde in, or excluded from, what

in upbrading an ungrateful Nation: But is this the reward of their unwearied
pains, inceſſant ſtudies, early riſing and late watching, beating their brains,
waſting their bodies, and contracting incurable diſeaſes, neglecting their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
relations, and accquaintance for the glory of God and good of their
Countrey? Muſt they onely have diſcouragements heaped upon them, bread

Of late years ſome of the <hi>Long Robe,</hi> no well wiſhers to the Church,

with much induſtry keep this notion up, that the three Eſtates of this Nation
conſiſt of King, Lords and Commons, which how far it may countenance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
actings and endanger future diſturbances, I humbly ſubmit to the prudence
of thoſe who ſit at the Helm, and are much better able to determine than my
ſelf; But the conſequences of that opinion ſeem directly to aim at the Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Sovereignty, and making it accountable to the other two in their eſteem
Coordinate Eſtates. Now by reſtoring the Spiritualty the only true third Eſtate
to its due Rights and antient Priviledges, for that it is the true third Eſtate, the

               <p>I ſhall begin with the Attainder of <hi>Cromwel</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who was attainted in Parliament
for Treaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Articles are every extant, and may be ſeen; the firſt reading of
his Bill, as I find it in the Journal of the Lords Houſe was upon the 17th of <hi>June, 32. Hen.</hi>
8th, at which reading were preſent Fourteen Biſhops; who they were you may ſee in the
Journal; at the ſecond reading, which was the 19th of <hi>June</hi> of the ſaid year, 32. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.
were preſent ſixteen Biſhops, whoſe Names, and Sees there you may find; at the third
and laſt reading, were ſixteen likewiſe, <hi>Vid. Journal ut ſupra,</hi> the Bill it ſelf paſt the
Royal Aſſent, the 24th of <hi>July</hi> following, when were 14 Biſhops preſent. The next ſhall be
the Attainder of <hi>Tho.</hi> Duke of <hi>Norf.</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Surry. 38. H. 8.</hi> This alſo was an
Attainder in Parliament: The firſt reading of the Bill againſt theſe Noble Lords, was on the
18th of <hi>January, Anno Regis ſupra dicto,</hi> when were preſent ten Biſhops; the ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
was the day following, when were preſent nine Biſhops: The third and laſt reading
was on the 20th of the ſame Moneth, when were preſent thirteen Biſhops; the Bill paſt the
Royal Aſſent, <hi>January</hi> 27th, 38. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. the Biſhops likewiſe then preſent. The third in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of <hi>Hen.</hi> D. of Suffolk, which indeed was an Attainder at Common Law, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
confirm'd in Parliament. <hi>A. 1</hi> &amp; 2. <hi>Phil. et Mar.</hi> at the firſt reading were preſent
12 Biſhops: the Bill was read, 5 <hi>Jan. Anno ſupradicto,</hi> at the 2d. reading, which was two
days after on the 7th of <hi>January</hi> were preſent eleaven Biſhops; and on the next day, the
Bill had its laſt reading in the Lords Houſe, at which were preſent eleaven Biſhops: the Lords
Spiritual, were likewiſe preſent at the paſſing of the Bill; which was on the 21 of <hi>Jan.</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
in each of theſe, the Journal if conſulted will ſatisfie any. The 4th Precedent ſhall be in
<hi>Seymore</hi> the Lord Admiral, who was attainted for Treaſon, in the 2d. of <hi>Edw. 6.</hi> for that
he purpoſed to deſtroy the young King, and to tranſlate the Crown unto himſelf; for
which, and other Crimes objected, he ſuffered Death, on the <hi>Tower-Hill:</hi> at his Attainder
were Preſent nineteeen Biſhops. I might have before added the Caſe of the Lord
<hi>Hungerfords</hi>-Attainder in Parliament; who was condemned in Parliament, in the 32. of
<hi>Hen.</hi> the 8th. at whoſe Tryal and Condemnation, were Preſent no fewer than ſeaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Biſhops, <hi>Vid.</hi> Journal of the Lords Houſe, I will only add two more Precedents, and cloſe
with them; they are in the Reign of the Peaceable Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in whoſe times if
ever, the Actings in Parliament were regular, and orderly: the firſt is, the Caſe of the
Earls of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> for their Rebellion in the North, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to bring in Popery, at whoſe Condemnation were preſent thirteen Biſhops, <hi>Vid.</hi> Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and laſtly that of <hi>Pagets,</hi> in the 29th of the ſaid Queen, at which were ten Biſhops,
<hi>Vid.</hi> Journal as before: I ſhall only add one thing more, and that is the Proteſtation of the
Biſhops. 11. <hi>R.</hi> 2 where they give the reaſon why they refuſed, to be put in ſome Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
