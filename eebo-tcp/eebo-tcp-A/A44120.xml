            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>E thinks it ſhould be time to ſpeak out, with as little care as we have need of apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logizing, when the orderly Diſcipline of the Church, the juſt right of the Civil Magiſtrate, the priviledge of immediate Eccleſiaſtical Superiours, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of Catholicks, now in hand are at once attaqu't. I only declare this reſolution at my firſt ſetting Pen to Paper (which really ſprings from the conceit of my own unworthineſs) that if, while I am writing this, I underſtand any other bends his endeavours to prevent the miſchiefs threatned, I ſhall withdraw my hand, and wholly rely on his; But if I hear of none, 'tis my hope, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives I have mentioned are abundantly ſufficient to ingage any honeſt and couragious heart without any further <hi>congè<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'eſcrire,</hi> to attempt the hinderance of ſuch ruinous effects. To the point then:</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Thomas White,</hi> whoſe eminent learning may juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be bluſtred at, and overthrown too, if its <hi>Baſis</hi> be not proportionably ſolid, and its ſtructure well compacted, had publiſht divers Treatiſes, attempting the rigorous rationali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45581:3"/>of Philoſophical and Theological Truths: The tenour of his Doctrine ran thus.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Faith,</hi> he endeavoured to advance its growth by lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping off all excreſcencies of erroneous opinions, how ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſoever intereſt or miſtakes of <hi>Probabliſts</hi> had made them; and to render it not only defenſible, but infallibly victorious, by ſeparating uncertain opinions, from the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, pledged to us as ſuch by Univerſal Tradition. This was apt to anger thoſe who drove a great trade in decrying all for Hereticks, who were not of their mind; that is, indeed who advanc'd not thoſe Tenets which made for their Politick Intereſt.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Chriſtian Practice,</hi> his way was to place no goodneſs in external actions, but as they conduc'd to interiour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and advanc'd charity; which was apt to ſpoil all Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical cleanſing the out-ſide of the platter, as alſo all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſneſs, and ſuperficial devotions; the gainful trade of too many.</p>
            <p>Was not this enough think you to ſet on fire a world of byaſt men, and all thoſe weak (though good) perſons too who were apt to be led by their cry? Or do we wonder af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this, the general noiſe ſhould be againſt him, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned and unpaſſionate Examiners on his ſide? To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>Subſuming under this method, he caſt his eye on that point of Faith which concerns the Churches government by the Hierarchy, and ſaw that under a ſpeciouſly-pious ſhew of making the Pope infallible in <hi>defining,</hi> and omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in acting; all Epiſcopacie in the Church, but his, was deſtroyed, and onely the bare name left. He ſaw alſo that General Councils were all at once caſt out of doors; For to what end ſhould thoſe aſſemble with ſuch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to themſelves and the whole Chriſtian world, if the Pope alone could define Faith and appoint Diſcipline as certainly and efficaciouſly as with them? Nay, be infallible even in matters of fact; with which new mad Hereſie, the Jeſuites (whoſe flattering Policie is now come to direct blaſphemy) are indeavouring to poſſeſs all the ignorant or timorous,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45581:3"/>or ambitious in <hi>France.</hi> Hereupon, to give the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, that is, the moſt advantageous growth to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or true Authority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> as conſtituted by our Saviour, inherited from S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and claim'd by the Title and Tenour of Univerſal Tradition; and to make it more defenſible, he was oblig'd to ſeperate it from the opiniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive point of the Pope's Extravagant Authority, lately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd by flatterers or the human policy of that Court; and alſo, that he might maintain diſperſt Epiſcopacy, to oppoſe the engros'd one, which was inconſiſtent with the former.</p>
            <p>Beginning then at the root (as his way is) he confuted, and (in the quality of a private Divine) cenſur'd that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Principle of the Popes perſonal Infallibility, as Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Arch-heretical. Hence, his <hi>Sonus Buccin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> which cenſur'd it, and his <hi>Tabulae Suffragiales,</hi> which proved at large the juſtneſs of that cenſure, by all imaginable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments a Catholick Divine could uſe, were both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd indeed, but neither of them confuted, which done, the angry rod of Condemnation was laid by a while till of late a <hi>Jeſuite</hi> oppos'd his <hi>Middle State.</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi> anſwer'd the three years Labour (for ſo long I am ſure 'tis at leaſt ſince the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> began to write againſt that Book) of that Author, and in likelihood of the whole <hi>Society,</hi> in three weeks. Muſt their credit ſink, and any one thrive that preſumes to be learneder then they? No; If Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon refuſe them her Patronage, Authority ſhall ſtep in and maintain them in deſpight of Reaſon. And indeed 'tis well known they neither love nor care to defend themſelves by Evidence of Reaſon: Authority is their beſt weapon; and the more blindly and confuſedly it is carry'd, the better for their turn. If they with any ſleights can get ſome great Men, or a multitude of inferior folks to ſay as they do; your Arguments are anſwered; and they protect themſelves by crying up thoſe great Few, or ſmal Many, for Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Inſtead of Reaſon then, out comes from the <hi>Roman Inquiſition</hi> a Condemnation of all his Books together, good and bad, Printed and Manuſcript, examin'd and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd, ſeen and unſeen: And this, brought in huggar-muggar,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45581:4"/>into <hi>England,</hi> is preſt by the paſſionate men for <hi>Faith</hi> to their weak Adherents; who are made believe that they are forbidden under heavy Cenſures to read his books, nay perhaps bound to hold him an Heretick, or what elſe they liſt to propoſe to their blindly-obedient Subjects. This, (abſtracting from the truth or falſehood of Mr. <hi>Woite's</hi> Doctrine) is the ſubject of my preſent complaint: In pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring which to all Candid lovers of Truth, and good Subjects to our Engliſh Laws, I make this</p>

               <p>SUppoſing this Condemnation be no perſonal Act of the Pope's, as <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Breves</hi> are, but only an Act of the <hi>Roman Inquiſition,</hi> which of courſe bears the Popes name, as all other Acts of the Courts of Judicature in <hi>Rome</hi> do, where the Pope is both Spiritual and Temporal Lord; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not moſt abſurd, prepoſterous, and diſſonant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the diſtinctive procedure of the Roman Court, to confound and equalize thoſe two ſorts of Actions, which 'tis known the Church and that Court look upon with ſo great a difference?</p>

Certainly, if in any caſes, Order be to be obſerved, it ſhould in thoſe which are to be obligatory, leſt excuſe of ignorance be left to cloak the Subjects diſobedience; and conſequently we ought not to think any private Travailer, or common Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45581:4"/>much leſs a <hi>Jeſuite</hi> (who is not onely a particular Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to the party condemned, but has not the leaſt Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Church, nor can have, as ſuch, no not ſo much as of a Paſtor of a Pariſh) we ought not I ſay to think ſuch a one a competent Officer to enjoyn the duty of acceptance; no more then the bare being of it in print, a ſufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation.

               <p>VVHether the Eccleſiaſtical Governors either dare in prudence, or will in Loyaltie receive an Act of this Nature without leave of the civil Magſtrate? And whether it be ever likely ſuch reception will be yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to? This I know, when the intollerably ſcandalous <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of the Caſuiſts</hi> put out by the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> was about to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and that the blow was judg'd unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> endeavoured to get this Clauſe inſerted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Provincial Letters, <hi>Quas non probat facultas, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pote quas audivit Romae damnatas, Which the faculty approves not, becauſe it heard they were condemned at</hi> Rome: And though this were but an occaſional glance, and imported only a non-improvement, yet becauſe they mention'd the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Inquiſition Act as the reaſon of their non-Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſee how tender the State of <hi>France</hi> were of it. The Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate General <hi>Menſ.

Or do we conceive it leſs illegal to bring the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Inquiſition into <hi>England,</hi> than 'tis in <hi>France</hi> to bring it in thither? In <hi>France</hi> none, without the Princes leave, may receive any Act of the Roman Inquiſition upon this Motive, becauſe it is theirs, or expreſs their non-approvement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Tribunal has done ſo. In <hi>England</hi> quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, theſe diſloyal men tell their Adherents none dare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe ſuch Acts, or hold them unobliging, and upon this ſole Motive, becauſe they proceed from that Inquiſition. The Laws of our Catholick Anceſtors ſtrictly forbid the extolling the power of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, debar his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Authority; theſe men and their followers go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and preſume not only to extol beyond meaſure the

Thus incroachment would come in by inches, and invading the juſt rights of the Civil Power, advance towards that proud and ſcandalous Doctrine of depoſing Kings, which the Roman Court of late times by its Decrees, has too much and too often abetted; and hence is this buſle of the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites to preſerve this principle alive, though they ſee it not ſeaſonable now to preſs it home to the Concluſion.

Hence difference in actions and mutual animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities are apt to ariſe, and fierce ones too; in regard one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is made fooliſhly to believe all is Faith which their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed Governours tell them: the other party conceive as high an indignation to ſee the Sacredneſs of Faith made ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous by ſuch a blundering and confounding zeal in the ſimple believers, and paltry intereſt in the Teachers. Now,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45581:8"/>who ſees not that the explication of this matter of Fact, and it's immediate conſequences, ſpeak direct ſpiritual breach, diſtance, difference, and diſunion of minds, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, words and actions, which ſound ſchiſmaticalneſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in all Conſcience.</p>
               <p>The Reſult of all hitherto is this, that ſince this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is neither legally ſent nor accepted, nor yet acceptable as the caſe ſtands; ſince it neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Faith in the leaſt, nor ought to concern <hi>Englands</hi> ſince the thus preſſing it is illegal breaking Order, and ſo Seditious, Schiſmatical, and diſgraceful to our Faith, by rendring it ridiculous, 'tis evident that the preſſers of it (and according to the degree of their knowledg their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers who accept it) are neither good Chriſtians, loyal Subjects, nor ſolidly Prudent Men; But deſperately pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing their own ambition, by flattering the Roman Courts in what ever precipices they engage themſelves and others. And, if they be ſuch, and it be not like they will amend, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they and the world be told publickly they are ſuch, I know no reaſon, why both Juſtice and Charity oblige me not to do it.</p>
               <p>All hitherto is ſpoken in caſe the Condemnation has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed iſſued from the Inquiſition of <hi>Rome:</hi> But, what if any one ſhould object that in all likelyhood it is none of Theirs, or at leaſt a Surreptitious one. All I could ſay is, I have yet heard it onely from private hands; which though I am not bound to credit, yet it breeds in me a ſuſpition of ſome ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>As for the Terms of the Decree it ſelf ſhould any except againſt them, that becauſe the two Phraſes, <hi>Heretical</hi> and <hi>Erroneous in Faith,</hi> ſignifie the ſame thing, one of them muſt needs be ſuperfluous, and ſo not likely to proceed from that Court: I could anſwer, that, as among <hi>Schollers,</hi> Tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies are blamable, ſo among Lawyers (ſuch as the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals for the moſt part are) nothing more ordinary then <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonama's</hi> and Repetitions. Should he go on, and object the inconveniences of a <hi>Diſ-junctive</hi> cenſure, as that it neither
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45581:8"/>condemns nor abſolves any point in <hi>particular,</hi> and ſo the world is never the wiſer for it. I could reply, that where the Judges have too much work (as they muſt needs have who draw to their immediate cogniſance almoſt all the ſpiritual buſineſs of the world) it ſaves a great deal of labour to forbid a Book in general, without undertaking the trouble of giving a particular reaſon for it, and though it would be a great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to be determinately inſtructed in the points for which an Author is cenſured; yet as to the common people, it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth their Governours ſay, there are Erroneous Opinions in him, and therefore, unleſs you have permiſſion to read prohibited Books, let him alone.</p>
               <p>Should he again inſiſt, That probably this Decree was not Authentick, becauſe (in the Copie printed at <hi>Rome</hi>) the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Name is miſ-written, as <hi>Blachei</hi> and <hi>Wilhi;</hi> I could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it with ſaying, <hi>Italians</hi> are not well acquainted with the hard names of us <hi>Tramontani;</hi> Or ſhould he urge the miſ-ſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſome Latine words, as <hi>Quarela, Bucins, Aucthore, Texerae,</hi> I could think it might happen by the haſtie zeal of the Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, without imagining the barbarous <hi>Goths</hi> had ſackt <hi>Rome</hi> again.

               <p>And yet all this is eaſyer to deal with, than one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward objection that ſtil remains; For ſhould any fall upon the laſt lines of the Decree, and ſay, It cannot be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd by any who reſpects the Roman Inquiſition, that it ſo threatningly ſhould command a Man to clear himſelf, and never tell him in particular, <hi>what's his fault;</hi> I am ſure I ſhould be ſhrewdly put to it to find an anſwer. And this is the clauſe I indeed fear may have been procur'd by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſome buſie <hi>Jeſuite;</hi> who, ſhould he meet with Mr. <hi>White,</hi> would ſcarce perhaps be able to bridle his head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong zeal from running full drive upon him, and with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen mouth cry out againſt him, Mr. <hi>White,</hi> you are accus'd and deeply cenſur'd, and that by no leſs than the Roman Inquiſition; <hi>Clear your ſelf, why don't you clear your ſelf?</hi> Of what? anſwers Mr. <hi>White;</hi> I ſay, <hi>clear your ſelf,</hi> ſays the <hi>Jeſuite;</hi> 'tis ſawcineſs to ask of what? or to queſtion Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, you'l chop logick with the holy Inquiſition, will you? No, but I would gladly be told my fault, replyes Mr. <hi>White,</hi> that I may know how to mend; and I hope you have ſo much charity as to wiſh it, and to put me in a way to it; Say you are ſorry for your fault, ſays the inſulting <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> and believe us you are in fault: This is our way of governing both our boyes and men too, and 'tis againſt the beſt vertue, Obedience, to demand more. I but Sir (ſayes Mr. <hi>White</hi>) by ſhewing me my fault, I may come to be made ſee the hainouſneſſe of it, and ſo be more heartily penitent. The very Spirit of an Heretick! cries the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> amain; this man will not think he is in fault, except he be ſhown it: <hi>Infallibility in matters of Faith</hi> and <hi>blind Obedience</hi> have no reverence with him. Here now, were Mr. <hi>White</hi> one of their Bigots, hee might be ſorry, though he knew not for what. But yet even that would not ſerve his turn, or relieve his ſad caſe a jot. He is bid <hi>clear himſelf,</hi> and heavily threatned if he do not. Now, ſince <hi>clearing</hi> is an Action, and Actions uſe to light upon particulars (for none can build an houſe or write a line in common) and in our caſe this <hi>clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> muſt either be perform'd by denying the books to be his, which were an open falſehood; or by juſtifying, or retract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45581:9"/>thoſe blameable Propoſitions, both which are impoſſible without knowing firſt the particular Propoſitions to be ſo juſtified or retracted, 'tis manifeſt hee is commanded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibles, and yet he is threaten'd ſhrewdly unleſſe he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them. The exacting brick without ſtraw was mild to this. That was poſſible to be perform'd by other combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matter, this impoſſible to any but a Conjurer. The non-performance of that was threaten'd with onely tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral penalties, this with ſpiritual: That lighter, coming from the hand of an Heathen and Tyrant; this a thouſand times heavier, pretending to come from the Authority of Governours, whoſe duty 'tis to put the erring into a way of amendment. What a diſreſpect then is it, towards the Inquiſition, and the Pope, in them, who dare impute ſuch an uncharitable procedure to thoſe prudent perſonages.</p>
               <p>After another faſhion were the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Books, and that in true Latin too, lately condemn'd; of which I doubt they ſpeak very ſeldom, and very gingerly to their Devotes: ſeveral Liſts of particular errors were collected out of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and diligently conferr'd with the books themſelvs, and this in almoſt every Dioceſſe of <hi>France,</hi> and at laſt the whole <hi>Apology,</hi> written by the Jeſuits in defence of thoſe errours, not onely condemn'd by the Biſhops and Dioceſan Clergy there, but by the Roman Inquiſition too, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their power in that Court, which they ſtretcht to the utmoſt.

In the General Congregation of the Holy Roman, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Inquiſition holden in the Apoſtolick Palace at St. <hi>Mary</hi> the Greater before his Holineſse Pope <hi>Alexander 7.</hi> and the moſt Eminent and moſt Reverend Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, deputed by the See Apostolick Inquiſitors General againſt Hereſy in the whole Chriſtian Commonwealth.</dateline>

                           <p>His Holineſs <hi>Pope Alexander 7.</hi> by this preſent Decree prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and condemns the Book entitled <hi>Apologie for the Caſuiſts, &amp;c.</hi> and wills that it be held for condemn'd and prohibited. And his Holineſſe farther commands that none of what degree or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſoever, though dignifyed with ſpecial or even most ſpecial Qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication keep or read the ſaid book; nor preſume to print, or cauſe to be printed, as well under the Penalties and Cenſures contain'd in the Holy Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and in the <hi>Index</hi> of prohibited Books, as others to be inflicted at the will of his Holyneſs: But whoever now hath, or ſhall hereafter at any time have the ſaid Book, ſhall under the ſame penalties be bound to deliver it up to the Ordinary, or the Inquiſitors.</p>

               <p>And now what Subſtantial difference do you find betwixt this Cenſure, and that againſt Mr: <hi>White;</hi> all I can ſee, is only the precept to clear himſelf; which, for want of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular charge, ſeems to have little legal ſignification; ſo that as to the general Cenſures of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Jeſuits have taſted of them, as well as Mr. <hi>White:</hi> and as to particular Ones of other places, far more in the proportion that almoſt all <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Lovain,</hi> exceed in Learning and Authority the ſingle pitiful Univerſity of <hi>Doway;</hi> which clearly argues E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence againſt the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and againſt Mr. <hi>White.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My laſt exception, and which makes me confident thoſe words of <hi>accurate examination</hi> mentioned in that paper, are either of courſe or falſifi'd, and ſo, not arguing an Act of the Inquiſition, is, that I ſee plainly they were ſo far from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately examining the Books that they never lookt ſo much as into the Titles; but have moſt ſtrangely miſtaken and Condemned for a Book of Mr. <hi>White's,</hi> one that was writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him by another Authour; and hath <hi>Authore I. S.</hi> on the Title-page. Mr. <hi>White</hi> writ <hi>Statera Morum;</hi> Another writ againſt one part of it, and entitled his book <hi>Statera Appenſa;</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi> reply'd, and call'd his Reply <hi>Staterae Aequilibrium.</hi> Now, theſe accurate Examiners, which this paper tells us of, examin'd ſo accurately, that they miſtook one Book for another; nor onely <hi>diſparate</hi> Books, but <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite</hi> ones; that is, the <hi>Objection</hi> for the <hi>Anſwer;</hi> nor needed they look far to have avoided the miſtake, had they but us'd the patience to have read quite thorough the Title-page be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they condemn'd the whole Book, it had been ſufficient to have prevented their errour. Is not this enough to diſgrace the whole Proceſſe and Pretence. Nor can they ſhelter the miſtake by <hi>Aequilibrium's,</hi> being bound in the ſame with <hi>Appenſa;</hi> For had all the Treatiſes there been Mr. <hi>White's,</hi> or at leaſt Mr. <hi>White's</hi> the firſt which entituled the Book: it had been ſome colour; but, when 'tis known <hi>Appenſa</hi> was writ by another Authour, who ſhew'd it to divers Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks of credit in the firſt foul Copy, conſtantly own'd it himſelf, and ſent one of his Copies to the Internunce of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> before it was printed, and had the two firſt Letters
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45581:11"/>of his name put in the Title-page challenging it, which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were no way competent to Mr. <hi>White,</hi> 'tis too evident the <hi>accurate</hi> Examiners read not, nor car'd to read the very Title-page thorough, but condemn'd at a venture they knew not what. And was it not, think you, a laudable piece of ſervice in that zealous Promooter who thus miſinform'd the Inquiſition, if this Cenſure truly proceeded from It? Or, if it be counterfeit, is it not an intollerable impudence to father ſuch groſſe miſtakes on ſo diliberate and prudent a Tribunal?</p>
               <p>Theſe are my Reaſons why I conceive no true reſpecter of that Inquiſition will blaze this Act for Theirs. Other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions too perhaps might be made, but I deſire to publiſh no more than I hear already reflected on.</p>
               <p>I onely add this word, and conclude, were this truly the Roman Inquiſition's Act, were it legally ſent, legally receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and promulgated here in <hi>England,</hi> and binding accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it's full Import; when all's done, it can onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thoſe Books to be look't on as <hi>prohibited,</hi> that is, not to be read without Licence; which, who in <hi>England</hi> either needs, or at leaſt may not eaſily have; nay, to read even thoſe written by profeſt Hereticks, and that too againſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks. Yet this is all the wool got by this great Cry.</p>
