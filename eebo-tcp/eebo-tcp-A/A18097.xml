            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Thy Galateo (Peterson) doth shrowd him selfe to long,</l>
            <l>What? shall it sleepe Endymions yeares? thou dost thy countrie wrong.</l>
            <l>She hath a childs parte, Plato saies, and with the Author cries,</l>
            <l>That both thy toile, and this her gaine, may reare his skill to skies.</l>
            <l>What thoughe thou thinke thy present small, for view of gallant ones?</l>
            <l>This litle Diamond, shall out prize, a quarry full of stones.</l>
            <l>And Noble Cyrus (Man) will daine cold water in Sinaetaes hand:</l>
            <l>Then fray not, if thy booke, in pure, vnfiled termes doe stand.</l>
            <l>Translatours can not mount: for though, their armes with wings be spread,</l>
            <l>In vaine they toile to take the flight, their feete are clogd with lead.</l>
            <l>This faith, that makes the Authour, speake his owne in language new:</l>
            <l>Renoumes the more, then if thou blazdst it out, in painted hew.</l>
            <l>For, serpents lurke in greenest grasse, and with a garishe gloze,</l>
            <l>The Stru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>pet pounts in pride, where matrones marche in comelie clothes.</l>
            <l>Go publishe it, and dreade not scowling Momus poisond spite.</l>
            <l>And though Archilochus Iambes fly, or Theons taunts doe byte:</l>
            <l>Thinke, winds doe haunt the gallauntst trees, and Enuy things of state.</l>
            <l>And lightning checks, Cerauniaes tops, whome no hils els do mate.</l>
            <l>The best haue borne the bob, and Zoiles brutes durst geue the charge:</l>
            <l>But Zoile hangs, and Callisthen keepes in cage for talking large.</l>
            <l>And yet, wordes they be winde: but as erst Plinies Draconite</l>
            <l>No toole could pierce or carue: or as the gemme Chalazias hight,</l>
            <l>Keepes cold, though it in Aetna frie, or Adiantons flowers</l>
            <l>Drawes not a drop, though skies distill downe euerlasting showers:</l>
            <l>So good desert, doth chalenge good reporte by reasons rate,</l>
            <l>Though oft they beare the checkes and taunts, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>not take the mate.</l>
            <l>Yet seeke Mecaenas wings to shroude thy toile: Virgilio</l>
            <l>Found his Augustus: Ennie thou maist finde thy Scipio.</l>
            <l>This trump shall sound thy praise. Syr Phoebus golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> rayes shall turne</l>

Casa, wherin vnder the person of an
old vnlearned man, instructing a youthe of his, he
hath talke of the maners and fashions, it behoues
a man to vse or eschewe, in his familiar
conuersation: intituled Galateo,
of fashions and maners.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or as muche as thou doste
now enter the iourny, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I haue allredy ronne forth
the better parte (as thou seest)
I meane the transitorie waye
of this mortall life: I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
(such is the Loue I beare thee) to
shewe all the daungerous straights thou must
passe: For my experience maketh me feare,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> walking that way thou mayst easily eyther
fall, or by some meanes or other go astray.
To the ende thou maist once, taughte both by
my instructions and experience, be able to
keepe the right waye, aswell for the helthe of
thy Soule, as the commendation and prayse
of the Honourable and Noble house thou
doest come of. And bycause thy tender Age,
is vnfit (as yet) to receaue more principall and
higher precepts, reseruing them for fytter
time, I will beginn to discourse of such things
as many men wyll deeme, perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce, but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:5179:9"/>
I meane what manner of Countenance
and grace, behoueth a man to vse, that hee
may be able in Communication and familiar
acquaintance with me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, to shewe him selfe ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
courteous, and gentle: which neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
is either a vertue, or the thing that comes
very nere to vertue. And albeit Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
or magnanimitie, of themselues beare a
greater prayse, then, to be a well taught or ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nored
man: yet perchaunce, the courteous
behauiour and entertaynement with good
maners and words, helpe no lesse, him that
hath them: then the high minde and courage,
aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ceth him in whome they be. For these be
such things as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> shall neede alwayes at all
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds to vse, because a man must necessarily be
familiar with me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> at all times, &amp; euer haue talk
&amp; communication with them: But iustice, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and the other greater, and more noble
vertues, are seldome put in vre. Neyther is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
liberall and noble minded man, caused euery
hower to doe bountifull things: for to vse it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
cannot any man beare the charge, by any
meanes. And these valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be so full of
hyghe minde and courage: are very seldome
driuen to trye their valour &amp; vertue by their
deeds. Then as muche as these last, doe passe
those fyrst, in greatnes (as it were) &amp; in weight:
so much do the other surmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t these in number,
&amp; ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to vse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. And, if I could wel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:5179:9"/>
it, I could name you many, whoe, (being
otherwise of litle account) haue ben &amp; be styll,
muche estemed &amp; made of, for their cherefull &amp;
plesaunt behauiour alone: which hath byn
suche a helpe &amp; aduaunceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t vnto them, that
they haue gotten greate preferments, leauing
farre behinde them, such men as haue byn en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with those other noble and better ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
spoken of before. And as these plesau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
&amp; ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tle behauiours, haue power to draw their

thought but light (&amp; to saye a trueth, it is not

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>panie &amp; fauour of men. And truly eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> as

these lyght, much hurt, or hurte at least more

&amp; vntaught, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked, &amp; more. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:5179:10"/>
there is no doubte, but who so disposeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to liue, not in solitarie and deserte pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as Heremites, but in fellowship with men,
and in populous Cities, will think it a very
necessarie thing, to haue skill to put himselfe
forth comely and seemely, in his fashions, ges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and maners: the lacke of which parts
doth make those other vertues lame, and litle
or nothing can they work to good effect, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
other helpes: wheare this ciuilitie and
courtesie, without other releefe or patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
is riche of it selfe, &amp; hath substance enough,
as a thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> standeth in speache and gestures
alone.</p>
            <p>And that y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> mayst now more easily learne
the way vnto it, thou must vnderstand, it
behoues thee, to frame and order thy maners
and doings, not according to thyne owne
minde and fashion: but to please those, with
whome thou lyuest, and after that sort direct
thy doings: And this must be done by <hi>Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Measure.</hi> For who so applieth himself
to much, to feede other mens humors, in his
familiar conuersation, and behauiour with
men, is rather to be thought a Iester, a Iugler
or flatterer, then a gentleman wel taught and
nourtured: As contrarywise, whoe so hath
no care or mynd to please, or displese, is a rude,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:5179:10"/>
vntaught, and vncourteous fellowe. For as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche
then, as our maners, haue some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in them when we respect other men, and
not our owne pleasure: if we dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tly searche
forthe what those things be, that most men
do generally lyke or dislike: we shall in suche
sorte wisely and easily finde out, the meanes &amp;
wayes, to choose and eschewe, those fashions
and maners, we are to leaue or take, to liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
men. We say then, that euery act
that offendeth any the common senses, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwarteth
a mans will and desire, or els
presenteth to the Imagination and conceite,
matters vnpleasaunt, &amp; that likewyse, which
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mynde doth abhorre, such things I say bee
naught, and must not be vsed: for <hi>vve must not
only refraine from such thinges as be fowle, filthy,
lothsome and nastie: but vve must not so muche
as name them. And it is not only a fault to dooe
such things, but against good maner, by any act
or signe to put a man in minde of them.</hi> And
therefore, it is an ilfauoured fashion, that some
men vse, openly to thrust their hands in what
parte of their bodye they lyst.</p>
            <p>Lykwise, I like it as yll to see a Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
fettle him selfe, to do the needes of Nature, in
presence of men: And after he hath doone, to
trusse him selfe againe before them. Neither
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:5179:11"/>
would I haue him (if I may geue him coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell)
when he comes from suche an occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,
so much as washe his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds, in the sight of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
company: for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the cause of his washing,
puts them in minde of some filthy matter that
hath bene done aparte. And by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
it is no good maner, when a man chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
to see, as he passeth the waye (as many
times it happeneth) a lothesome thing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wil
make a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to cast his stomacke, to tourne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the company, &amp; shewe it them. And much
worse I like it, to reache some stynking thing
vnto a man to smell vnto it: as it is many a
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to do, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> importunate meanes, yea,
thrusting it vnto their nose, saying: <hi>Foh, feele I
pray you, hovv this doth stink: vvhere they should
rather say, smell not vnto it: for it hath an yll sent.</hi>
And as these and lyke fashions offend the se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
to which they appertaine: so to grynde
the teethe, to whistle, to make pityfull cryes,
to rubb sharpe stones together, and to fyle
vppon Iron, do muche offend the Eares and
would be lefte in any case. Neither must wee
refraine those things alone, but we must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
beware we do not syng, and specialy alone,
if we haue an vntuneable voyce, which is a
common fault with moste men: And yet, hee
that is of nature least apt vnto it, doth vse it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:5179:11"/>
moste. So there be some kynde of men, that
in coffyng or neesing,<note place="margin">Neesing.</note> make suche noyse, that
they make a man deafe to here them: other
some vse in lyke things, so little discretion,
that they spyt in mens faces that stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them: besydes these there be some, that in
yauning, braye and crye out like Asses. And
yet such, with open mouth wil euer say and do
what they list, and make such noyse, or rather
such roaring, as the dumme man doth, when
he striueth with him selfe to speake. All these
yllfauoured fashions, a man must leaue, as
lothsome to the eare and the eye. And a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
must leaue to yawne muche,<note place="margin">Yawning.</note> not only for the
respect of the matter I haue saide alreadye, as
that it seemes to proceede, of a certaine wery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that shewes that he that yawneth, could
better like to be els where, then there in that
place: as wearied with the companie, their
talke, and their doings. And sure, albeit a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
be many times disposed to yawne, yet if he
be occupied with any delyght, or earnest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to think vppon: he shall haue no minde
to doe it. But if he be lumpishe &amp; idle: it is
an easy matter to fall into it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>VVhen a man yavvneth, in place vvhere
there bee slouthfull and Idle folkes, that
haue nothing to doe, the rest, as you may see
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:5179:12"/>
many times, yavvne againe for companie by &amp; by:</hi>
as if he that yawned, had put them in minde
to doe it, which of them selues they would
haue done first, if hee had not begoone vnto
them. And I haue many tymes heard lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and wise men say, that <hi>A yavvner meaneth
as much in Latin as a careles and Idle bodie.</hi> Let
vs then flye these condicions, that loathe (as
I sayd) the eyes, the Eares, &amp; the Stomacke.
For in vsing these fashyons, we doe not only
shewe that we take litle pleasure in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
but we geue them occasion withall, to
iudge amis of vs: I meane y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue a drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sye
&amp; heuie nowle, which makes vs yll well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com,
to all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>panies we come vnto. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
thou hast blowne thy nose,<note place="margin">Blowing of the nose.</note> vse not to open thy
handkercheif, to glare vppon thy snot, as if y<hi rend="sup">u</hi>
hadst pearles and Rubies fallen from thy
braynes: for these be slouenly parts, ynough to
cause men, not so much not to loue vs, as if
they did loue vs, to vnloue vs againe. As
the Sprite of <hi>Labirintho</hi> doth testifie (who so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
he were that made it) who (to quenche y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
heate wherwith Master <hi>Iohn Boccase</hi> burned
in desyre and Loue of his Lady vnknowne)
tells,<note place="margin">Looke in the beginning of Corbaccio.</note> how she cowred her taile ouer the ashes,
sytting vppon her heeles, and coughed and
spatte out Collops.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:5179:12"/>It is also an vnmanerly parte, for a man to
lay his nose vppon the cup where another
must drinke:<note place="margin">Dropping of the Nose.</note> or vppon the meate y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> another
must eate, to the end to smell vnto it: But
rather, I would wish he should not smell
at all, no not to that which he himselfe
should eate and drinke: because it may
chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce there might fall some droppe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
his nose, that would make a man to loath
it: although there fall nothing at all in
deede. Neither, by mine aduise, shalt thou
reache to any man, that cup of wine wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
thy selfe hast fyrst dronke and tasted: w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
he be more then a familiar friend vnto
thee. And much lesse must thou giue any
parte of the peare or the fruite, which thou
hast bitten in thy mouth before. And es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme
not light of my talke, for that these
things be of little account: <hi>For euen light
stripes</hi> (their number may be such) <hi>be able
to slaye fast ynoughe.</hi>

            <p>Now you shall vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d, there was in
<hi>Verona,</hi> a bishop a wise ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, a learned &amp; of a

good parts y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were in him, he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
courtious &amp; liberall, to all gentlemen &amp;
noble men that came vnto him, doing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honor he could in his house, not with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:5179:13"/>
ouer much pompe and cost, but with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
entertainement and measure, such
as besemed well a man of the Clergie. It
chaunced in his time, a noble gentleman
called <hi>Count Richard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Count Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard.</note> passing that way, to
spend a fewe dayes with the Bishop and
his householde together: which was tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
furnished w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> honest gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> and
very well learned. And bycause they found
him a Noble gentleman, courteous and
well beseene in all good behauiour, they
praysed him muche, and made muche of
him, saue that one vnmanerly fashion they
muche misliked in him. When the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
was aduertised of it, consulting with
some of his familiars about it (as he was a
wise man in all his doings) straite they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
it should be necessary to let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

haue knowledge of it: albeit they feared,
they should offend him. Upon this, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Count</hi>
taking his leaue, and redy to ryde away
the next morning, the Byshop called one
of his seruants vnto him, (a man of good
discretion) and gaue him in charge to take
his horse, to beare the <hi>Count</hi> company, some
parte of his waye: And when he sawe his
time, after an honest sorte, to tell him, that
which they had determined betwene them
selues. The same gentleman that had
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:5179:13"/>
this charge, was a man well strooken in
yeares, very lerned, and meruailous plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt,
welspoken, comely, and had muche
frequented in his time, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Courtes of greate
Princes: who was (perhaps) and is, called

               <note place="margin">Galateo.</note> at whose request and councell, I

<hi>Syr Count, my Lorde yealdeth you many
thanks for the honour you haue done him, in
that it hath pleased you to vouchesafe his poore
house: and that he may not be vnthankfull, for
this your greate courtesie shevved vnto him, he
hath geuen me in charge, that I must leaue a
present vvith you in his behalfe: and he sends
it vnto vnto you vvith earnest request, that you
please to take it in good vvorthe: and this is
the gift. You are a goodly gentleman, and
the best manered man my Lorde hath euer
seene: So that very heedefully beholding
your behauiours, and particularly considering
them all, hee findeth no one that is not very
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:5179:14"/>
comely and comendable, only one vnsemely
trycke alone excepted, vvhich you make vvith
your lippes and your mouth together, feeding
at your meate vvith a certaine straunge noyes,
vnpleasaunt to all men that heare it. This my
Lord willed me to tell you, and prayes you to
endeuour your selfe to leaue it, and vvithall to
accept in levve of a beter present, this louing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
and councell of his: for he is sure,
there is none in the vvorlde, would make you
the like present.</hi> The <hi>Count</hi> (that neuer
wyst of his fault till now) hearing himselfe
reproued, chaunged his countenance a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
but (as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> full of stomacke ynough)
taking hart at gras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, he said: <hi>Tell your
Lorde, that yf all the gifts that men vvont to
geue eche other, vvere such as his, men should
be muche more riche then they are. And for
his greate courtesie and liberalitie to mee, geue
him many thanks I pray you, and let him be
sure, I will not fayle from henceforthe to mend
my fault, and God be vvith you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what shal we thinke this Bishop,
his modest and honest company about him
would say,<note place="margin">Greedy feeding.</note> if they sawe these whome wee
see other while, (like swyne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their snouts

both their cheeks blowne (as if they should
sound a trumpet, or blowe the fyer) not eate

many tymes with these filthy nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyns,
to wype awaye the sweat that trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

face and their necke (they be such greedy
guts in their feeding) and otherwhile to,
(when it comes vppon them) spare not to

these beastly behauiours and fashions,
deserue not alone, to be thrust out of this
noble bishops house, that was so pure and
cleane: but to be throughly banished all
places, where any honest men should com.
Let a man then take hede, hee doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grease
his fyngers so deepe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he befyle the

it: neither is it good maner, to rubbe your
gresie fingers vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread you must eate.</p>
            <p>The seruaunts that bee appointed to
waite vppon the table, must not (in any
wise) scratche and rubbe their heades,<note place="margin">Precepts for seruaunts.</note> nor
any parte els in the sight of their Lorde &amp;
Master: nor thrust their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds in any those

partes of their body that be couered, no not
so muche as make any proffer: as some
careles fellowes doo, holding their hands
in their bosome, or cast vnder the flappes of
their coates behind them. But they must
beare them abroade without any suspicion
and keepe them (in any case) washt &amp; cleane
without any spot of durt vppon them. And
they that cary the dyshes, or reache the cup,
must beware at that time, they doe not spit,
coughe or neese: for in such doings, <hi>Suspicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
is as greate, and offendeth asmuche, as the very
deede it selfe:</hi> and therefore, seruants must
forsee, they geue no cause to Maisters to
suspect: For that which might chaunce, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyeth
asmuche, as if it had chaunced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede.</p>
            <p>And if thou do roaste any fruite, or make
a toaste at the fyer, thou must not blowe
of the ashes, (if there be any) for it is an old
saying, that, <hi>vvinde vvas neuer vvithout wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
But y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> must lyghtly stryke it vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the

beate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ashes. Thou shalt not offer thy
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>dkerchiefe to any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to vse it, albeit, it be
very cleane washed: for he to whome thou
doest offer it, can not (perhaps) awaye w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
it, and may be to curious to take it.</p>
            <p>When a man talketh with one,<note place="margin">Breathing in a mans face.</note> it is no
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:5179:15"/>
good maner to come so neere, that he must
needes breathe in his face: for there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that can not abyde to feele the ayer of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
mans breathe, albeit there come no
yll sauour from him. These and lyke fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions,
be very vnsemely, and would be
eschewed, because their senses, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whome
we acquaint our selues, cannot brooke nor
beare them.</p>
            <p>Now, let vs speake of those things which
(without any hurt or anoyau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses)
offende the minds of most men, before
whome they be doone. You shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that <hi>The appetites of men, (throughe a
naturall instinct and inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>) beverie strange
and diuers:</hi> Some be cholerike &amp; hasty, &amp;
may not be satifsied with out reuenge: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe giue them selues cleane ouer, to
pamper the belly: this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> sets his delighte
in lust and sensualitie: that man is carried
away with his couetous desires: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
suche appetites more there are, to
which mans mynde is too subiect: but
you shall not in any company, easily iudge
or discerne betweene them, where and
in what, they bee moste affected. For,
these matters doe not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sist in the maners,
the fashions and speache of men: but rest in
some other point. They seeke to purchase y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:5179:16"/>
which the benefit of mutuall conferrence
may yeald them, &amp; that doe (as I weene)
good will, honour, comforte and pleasure,
or some other thing lyke vnto these: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must neither say or doe the thing,
that may giue any signe of litle louing or
esteming them, we liue withall.</p>
            <p>So that, it is a rude fashion, (in my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipte)
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> som men vse, to lye lolling a sleepe
in that place, where honest men be met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
of purpose to talke. For his so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
shewes that he doth not esteeme the
company, and little rekoneth of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> or their
talke. And more then that, he that slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
(and specially lying at litle ease, as he
must) wonts (for the moste parte) to doe
some fowle thing, to beholde, or heare: and
many tymes they awake sweating and
driueling at the mouth. And in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
to rise vp where other men doe sit and
talke, and to walke vp and downe the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
it is no poynt of good maner. Also
there be some that so buskell them selues,
reache, streatch and yawne, writhing now
one syde, and then another, that a man
would weene, they had some feuer vppon
them: A manifest signe, that the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
they keepe, doth weary them.</p>
            <p>Likewise doe they very yll, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> now &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:5179:16"/>
pull out a letter ont of theyr pocket, to
reade it: as if they had greate matters of
charge, and affaires of the common weale
committed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. But they are much
more to bee blamed, that pull out theyr
knyues or their scisers, and doe nothing els
but pare their nayles, as if they made no
account at all of the company, and would
seeke some other solace to passe the time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye.
Theis fashions to, must be left, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
some men vse, to sing betwene the teeth, or
playe the dromme with their fingers, or
shoofle their feete: For these demeanours
shewe that a body is carelesse of any man
ells.</p>
            <p>Besides, let not a man so sit that he turne
his tayle to him that sitteth next to him:
nor lye fottering with one legg so hygh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the other, that a man may see all bare
that his cloathes would couer. For such
parts be neuer playde, but amongst those
to whome a man needs vse no reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce.
It is very true, that if a gentleman should
vse these fashions before his seruants, or in
the prefe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce of some friende of meaner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
then him selfe: it would betoken no
pride, but a loue and familiaritie.</p>
            <p>Let a man stand vppright of him selfe,

pounche his fellow with his elbowe, (as
many be wont to doe) at euery worde they
speake, saying: <hi>Did not I say true Sirra, Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
N. It is Master. H.</hi> And still they be iot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

            <p>I would haue euery man well appare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,<note place="margin">Apparell.</note>
meete for his age and calling: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
they seeme to haue men in contempt
that be better attyred then themselues.</p>
            <p>And therfore the Citizens of <hi>Padua,</hi> were
woont to take it done of spighte vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,
when any gentleman of <hi>Venice</hi> walked vp
&amp; downe their citie in his coate, as though
he thought him selfe in the countrey. And
a mans apparell, would not be made of
fine cloathe alone: but he must frame it, all
that he may, to the fashions that other men
weare, and suffer him selfe to bee lead by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
vse: although (perchaunce) it be, and
seeme to be lesse commodious, lesse gallant,
and lesse faire in shewe, then his oulde.</p>
            <p>And if all men els, doe weare their heads
powled: it shalbe an yll sight for thee alone,
to weare a longe bushe of haire. And
where other men, make muche of their
beardes and weare them longe: thou
shalt not doe well to cut thine of, or shaue
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:5179:18"/>
it. For that weare to be ouerthwarte in
euery thing: which thou must (in any case)
beware of, except necessitie require it, as
thou shalt heare hereafter. For this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularitie,
beyond all other yll customes,
makes vs generally spyted of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. Thou
must not then go against common cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
in these things, but vse them measure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably:
that thou maist not bee an odd man a
lone in a countrey: that shall weare a long
Gowne downe to the foote, where other
men weare them very shorte, litle beneath
the waste. For as it hapens to him, that
hath a very crabbed ylfauoured face, (I
meane suche, as is more harde and sower
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> most mennes be, for nature doth mostly
shape them well in moste men) that men
will wonder and (with a kinde of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
gape most vppon him: So fares
it with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> that attire them selues, not as
most men doe: but as they are egged by
their owne fantasticall heads, with lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>g
heare spred downe to their shoulders,
their beardes short and shauen, and weare
quaiues or greate cappes after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Flaundres</hi>
fashion: that all men doe gaze vppon them,
as wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>dering at suche, whome they weene
haue taken vppon them, to conquer all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:5179:19"/>
countries wheresoeuer they come. Let
your apparell then, be very well made, and
fit for your body: for they that weare rich
and coastly garments, but so illfauouredly
shaped, that a man would weene the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
had byn taken by another: geue vs to
iudge one of these twaine, that eyther
they haue no regarde or consideration how
to please or displease: or els haue no skill to
iudge of measure or grace, or what doth
become them.</p>
            <p>Such maner of people, with their rude
behauiours and fashions, make men with
whome they liue, suspect, they doe es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme
them but light. And that causeth
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> worse welcome whersoeuer they com
and yll beloued amongest men.</p>
            <p>But there be some besides these, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
more then bare suspicion: their deeds
and their doings be so intollerable, that a
man cannot abide to liue amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>gest them by
any meanes. For they be euer a let, a
hurt and a trouble to all the companie, they
be neuer redie: euer a trimming: neuer
well dressed to their mindes. But when
men be readie to sit downe to the table,
the meate at the boorde, and their handes
washed: then they must write or make
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:5179:19"/>
water, or haue their exercise to doe: saying,
<hi>It is too early: vve myght haue taryed a
vvhile: vvhat haste is this, this morning?</hi>
And thus they disquiet all the company, as
men, caring for them selues alone &amp; theyr
owne matters, without consideration in
the worlde of other men. Besides this,
they will in all things be preferred aboue
others: they must haue the best bed, and
best chamber: they must take vppon them
the highest place at the table, and be first
set and serued of all men. And they be so
deintie and nice, that nothing pleaseth
them, but what they them selues deuise:
they make a sower face at any thing ells.
And they be so proude minded, that they
looke that men should waite vppon them
when they dyne, ryde, sporte, or solace them
selues.</p>
            <p>There be other so furious, testie &amp; way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
that nothing you doe can please
them: and what soeuer is said they aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
in choler, and neuer leaue brauling w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
their seruants, and rayling at them, and
continually disturbe the company with
their vnquietnes: vsing such speeches:
<hi>Thou cauledst me vvell vp this morning.
Looke heere hovv cleane thou hast made these
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:5179:20"/>
pynsons. Thou beaste, thou diddest vvaite
vvell vppon me to Churche. It vvere a good
deede to breake thy head.</hi> These be vnseme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and very fowle fashions: suche as euery
honest man will hate to death. For, albeit
a mans minde were full fraught with all
humilitie, and would vse these maners, not
vppon pride or disdaine, but vppon a reche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
care, not heeding his doings, or elles
by meanes of yll custome: yet notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
because his outward doings, woulde
make men thinke him proude: it cannot be
chosen, but all men would hate him for it.
For, <hi>Pride<note place="margin">Pryde.</note> is none other thinge, then to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise
and disdaine another.</hi> And as I haue
saide from the beginning: <hi>Eache man desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to bee vvell thought of, Albeit there bee
no valoure or goodnes in hym.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not long, synce there was in <hi>Rome</hi>
a worthy gentleman, of singular good witt
and profound learning, whose name was
<hi>Vbaldino Bandinelli.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vbaldino Bandinelli.</note> This gentleman was
woont to say, that as ofte as hee went or
came from the Courte, although the stretes
weare euer full of gallant Courtiers, of
Prelates and Noble men, and likewise of
poore men, and people of meane and base
condition: yet he thought he neuer encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
any, that was eyther better or worse
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:5179:20"/>
then himselfe. And without doubte hee
could meete with fewe, that might bee
compared in goodnes to him: respecting
his vertues, that did excel beyond measure.
But we must not alwayes in these things
measure men by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Elne: We must rather
waye them in the millers scoles, then in
the goldsmythes balaunce. And it is a
courtious parte, redily to receaue them in
to fauour: not bycause they bee woorthe it:
but as men doe with coynes, bycause they
be currant,</p>
            <p>To go further, wee must doe nothing in
their syght whome wee desire to please,
that may shewe wee couet, rather to rule
and to reigne, then to liue in a familiar
equalitie amongest them. For hautines
of harte and ambitious disposition, as it
kindleth an yll opinion: so it ministreth
muche cause of contempte, which in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
will so woorke against thee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou
shalt bee cleane cast out of honest compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
But our dooings must rather beare a
signe and shewe of reuerence,<note place="margin">A lowly minde.</note> meekenes, &amp;
respect to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> company, in which wee fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
our selues. So that, what so euer is
doone in meete and conuenient time, may
hapely deserue no blame: but yet in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of the place and the persone, it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:5179:21"/>
may be reproued well: althoughe for it self,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter deserue no rebuke. As to brawle
and to raile at your seruaunts (which we
haue talked of before) but muche more to
beate them. Because these partes, are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche
as to reigne and to rule: which no

Theis maner of fashions and behauiours,

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it makes a mans hart ake to heare them:

be such kinde of people: as it is but labour
lost to heare, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the very best exployts they
doe, when they be most awake, and labour
most to shew their best. Wherfore we must
not trouble men with so base and absurde
matter as dreames bee: especially suche
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:5179:25"/>
foolyshe things, as most tymes men haue.
Albeit I haue heard say many times, that
wisemen in times past, haue leaft in their
bookes many sortes of dreames, conteining
matters of deepe knowledge and vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
it followeth not yet, that wee, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
and common sorte of people, should
vse it in our familiar and common talke.
And sure of all the dreames that euer I
heard (albeit I hardly listen to any) in my
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ceit, I neuer heard any, that was worth
the hearing but one alone, which the good
<hi>Master Flaminio Tomarozzo</hi>
               <note place="margin">M. Flaminio Tomarozzo.</note> a gentleman of
<hi>Rome</hi> did see, a man not vnlearned and

ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Master Flaminio Tomarozzo, thought
he was sitting in a very riche Apothecaries
shop, a neere neighbour of his. And after he had
byn there a while (what soeuer the occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> was)
the people vvere vp in a rore one a sodayne, and
fell to spoilyng of all that vvas in the shoppe.
One tooke on Electuarie, another a Confectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,
some one thing, some another, and presently
eate it vpp all: So that within a while, there was
neither virell glasse, ertherne pot, wodden boxe,
nor any pot els of drugges, that was not emptied
broken, or ouerthrowne. But amongest them
all, ther vvas one verye small glasse, full to the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:5179:26"/>
toppe of verie cleare vvater, vvhich many did
smell to, but no man vvould taste. He stoode
not there long, but there came in a tall man, an
aged and very graue man, to looke vnto. This
Aged father beholding this vnfortunate Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
boxes and pottes, and finding some
emptyed, some ouerthrowne, and the better
parte broken: at lenght casting his eye asyde, he
chaunced to see the smal glasse I spake of before,
and setting the same to his mouthe, hee dranke
it vp so cleane: that he leaft not one droppe. And
this doone, he went from thence as the rest did
before. Master Flaminio vvas abashed and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueled
muche at this matter. And therefore
turning to the Apothecarie he sayed vnto him:
Syr, whoe is this that came laste? and why
did he drinke vp so sauourly, all the vvater in
that litle glasse, vvhich all the reast refused. To
vvhome the Apothecarie seemed to make this
aunsvver. My sonne, this is the Lord God.
And the vvater, that hee alone dranke, and all
the reast refused &amp; vvould not taste as you savv:
vvas discretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>: vvhich, you knovv vvel ynough

            </p>
            <p>Such kind of dreames, I hould well
a man may rehearse, and heare with much
pleasure and profit. Bycause they doe
more resemble, the Cogitations &amp; thoughts
of an awakened minde: or better, I
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:5179:26"/>
shoulde say, the vertue sensitiue: then the
visions and syghts of a drowsie head. But
those other dreames, without shape, fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
or sense: (which the moste parte of suche
men as we are, bee wont to haue) would be
forgotten cleane, and lost with our sleepe.
Howbeit, I doe not deny but the dreames
of good men and learned, be better and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
then theires of the wicked and more
vnlearned sorte.</p>
            <p>And albeit a man would weene, there
can bee nothing in the worlde more vaine
then <hi>Dreames:</hi> yet there is one thing more
light then they, and that are <hi>Lyes.<note place="margin">Lyes.</note> For there
is yet some shadovve, and, as it vvere, a certaine
feeling of that vvhich a man hath seene in his

should lesse busie mens eares, and their

because they bee otherwhile receiued for
truethes. But tyme, in the ende, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
suche pelfe: that lyers, not only doe
gayne no credite, but no man vouche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes

hee be suche, as hathe plenty and store
of those deare and deintye things.</p>
            <p>Wee must not boast of those good things
that be in vs, nor set them to lyght: for in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
one, wee doe vpbraide men their faults: In
the other, wee scorne to muche their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
But it behoueth euery man to speake
his owne praise, as litle as hee may. And
if occasion driue him vnto it: it shalbe good,
modestly to speake the truethe, as I haue
told you before.</p>
            <p>And therefore, they that desire to doe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
a pleasure: must needes leaue one faulte, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
is to common with all men: they must not
shewe them selues so afraide and fearefull
to speake their mindes, when a man dothe
aske their aduise. For, it is a deadly paine to
here the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, &amp; specialy if they be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t

they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>e to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mater? <hi>Sir I beseche you pardon
mee, if I doe not say vvell. I vvill speake like a
gros ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> as I am: &amp; grosly according to my pore
skil. And Sir, I am sure you vvil but mocke me
for it. But yet, to obey you:</hi> &amp; they drawe their
words forth so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>g, &amp; put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> selues to suche
paine: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, while these ceremonies be a doi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>g, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
hardest questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, might haue byn deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
with fewer words and shorter time:
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:5179:29"/>
bycause they cannot get out of these protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
when they bee in.</p>
            <p>They bee also very tedious to men, and
their conuersation &amp; maners are very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome:
whoe shewe too base and abiect a
minde in their doings. And where the che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
and highest place,<note place="margin">Abiecte Minde.</note> is apparantly due
vnto them: they will euer creepe downe to
the lowest. And it is a spitefull buisynes
to thrust them vp: For they will straite
iogge backe againe, like a resty Iade,
or a Nagge that startleth a side at his sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe.
So that, there is muche a dooe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
them, when wee meete at a doore. For
they will not (for all you can dooe) in any
case enter before you, but so trauerse their
ground, go ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ke, and so fray and defend
with their armes and their handes: that
at euery thirde steppe, a man must be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to wage battell with them: and thus
they breake of, all solace and pleasure, and
otherwhile, the buisynes they meete a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute.</p>
            <p>And therfore, <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ceremonies.</note> which wee
name, as you heare, by a straunge terme, as
lacking a worde of our owne, bycause our
elders, hauing no knowledge of those su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
fashions, coulde not well giue
them a proper name. <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> I saye,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:5179:29"/>
(in my Iudgement,) differ not much from
lyes &amp; dreames, for their own very vainesse
it selfe. So that wee may couple and
ioyne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> together in this our treatise, sithe
occasion serues so fytt to speake of them
here, As a good man hath often shewed
me: those solemnities that church men doe
vse at their Altars, and in their diuine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
bothe to God and his holy things, are
properly called <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> but after, men
did begyn, to reuerence eche other with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
entertaynements, more then were
conuenient, and would be called masters
and Lords, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>gest them selues, yealding
bending, and bowing their bodyes, in toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
of reuerence one to another, vncouering
their heads, vsing highe titles and Styles
of honour, and kyssing their hands as if
they were hollye things: some body, by like
considering all these things well, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
these newe founde curious follyes
without any name: thought good to Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and call them <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> but sure in
a iest as I take it: as to be mery and make
good cheare, we terme it in sport, a triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ph:
which custome, no doubt, tooke not his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at vs, but elles where, as barbarous &amp;
straunge: and not long since, from whence
I knowe not, transported into <hi>Italie:</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:5179:30"/>
whose deedes being wretched, and effects
base and vile, hath gotten encrease and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
in vayne woords alone, and superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
titles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ceremonies</hi> then, if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sider well their
inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts that vse them: are but vaine shewes
of honour and reuerence, towardes him to
whome they be doone: framed of semblance
and wordes touching their titles and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
offers. I say vaine: In that we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to their face, whome we reuerence
not in deede, but otherwhile co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>temne. And
neuertheles, because we may not go agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>st
custome, wee giue them these titles: <hi>The
most honorable Lord suche a one: the Noble
Lord suche a one.</hi> And so otherwhile wee
offer them our humble seruice: whome wee
could better vnserue then serue, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maund
then doe them any duety.</p>
            <p>The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> not <hi>Lesinges</hi> alone, but also <hi>Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
and <hi>Treasons,</hi> shalbe called <hi>Ceremonies.</hi>
But because these wordes and these titles
aboue rehersed, haue lost their stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>gth: and
waste, (as a man may say of Iro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>) their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such continuall occupying of it as we
doe vse: we must not so precisely way them
as other wordes, nor so strictly construe the
meaning of them. And, that this is true,
that which allwayes happens to all men,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:5179:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dothe shewe it playne inoughe. For if wee
meete with a man, we neuer sawe before:
with whome, vppon some occasion, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houes
vs to talke: without examining wel
his worthines, most commonly, that wee
may not offend in to litle, we giue him to
much, and call him <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
<hi>Sir,</hi> althoughe he be but some <hi>Souter</hi>
or <hi>Barbar,</hi> or other suche stuffe: and all by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is appareled neate, somewhat gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
lyke.</p>
            <p>And as men in tymes past,<note place="margin">Titles by Priuilege.</note> were wont to
haue vnder the <hi>Priuilege</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> &amp; <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi>
peculiar &amp; distinct titles of honour,
which might not be vntouched, without
doing wrong to the priuileged men: nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
attributed &amp; geuen without a scorne,
to them that were no such priuileged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones:
So at this daie, wee must more
freely vse those titles, and the other signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of honour, like to those titles: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Custome the mightiest Lorde</hi> hathe
largely therewith, priuileged men of our
time.</p>
            <p>This vse and custome, though so fayre
and gallant without, is altogether vaine
within, and consisteth in semblance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
effect, &amp; in wordes without meaning.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:5179:31"/>
But this notwithstanding,<note place="margin">Custom must not be altered</note> it is not lawful
for vs to chaunge it: but rather, bycause it
is not our fault, but the fault of our tyme,
wee are bounde to followe it: but yet wee
must discretely doe it.</p>
            <p>So that wee are to noate,<note place="margin">The end why ceremonies be vsed.</note> that <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
are vsed, eyther for a <hi>Profit,</hi> or for a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi>
or for a <hi>Duetie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ceremonies for profit.</note> And euery lye that is
told for a mans priuate profit: is a deceite,
a sinne, and a dishonest parte: for, in what
so euer it bee, <hi>A man can neuer honestly lye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is a common fault with flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
that counterfet them selues to be our
friends, and apply them selues euer to our
desiers, what soeuer they be: not bycause
wee would haue it so, but to the ende wee
should doe them some pleasure, for it. And
this is not to please vs, but to deceiue vs.
And albeit this kind of fault be, peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by reason of custome sufferable: yet
notwithstanding bycause of it selfe, it is
fowle and hurtefull, it yll becomes a gentle
man to doe it. <hi>For it is no honestie to seeke
a pleasure by the hurt of another.</hi> And if lyes
and false flatteries, may bee termed <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi>
(as I haue sayde before:) so oft, as
we vse them for respect of our gain &amp; profit:
so oft wee doe hazard our good name and
credite: so that this consideration alone,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:5179:31"/>
myght moue vs well to leaue all <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
and vse them no more.</p>
            <p>It resteth now that I speake of those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
bee done of <hi>Dutie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dutifull cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</note> and of those that be done
of a <hi>Vainesse.</hi> As touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first, <hi>VVe must
not leaue them vndone in any wise. For he
that faileth to doe them, dothe not onely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please,
but doth a wrong to him, to whome they
be due.</hi> And many times it chaunceth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
men come to daggers drawing, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> for this
occasion alone, that one man hath not done
the other, that worship and honour vppon
the way, that he ought. For to saye a trueth
<hi>The power of custome is great &amp; of much force,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Custome is a lawe.</note>
(as I said) <hi>and would be taken for a lawe,</hi> in
these cases. And that is the cause we say:
<hi>You:</hi>
               <note place="margin">You.</note> to euery one, that is not a man of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
base calling, and in suche kinde of speach
wee yealde such a one, no maner of courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
of our owne. But if wee say: <hi>Thou:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Thou.</note> to
suche a one, then wee disgrace him and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him outrage and wronge: and by suche
speach, seeme to make no better reconing of
him, then of a knaue and a clowne.</p>
            <p>And although the tymes past, and other
countryes, haue vsed other maners: let vs
yet, keepe our selues to our owne: And let
not vs dispute the matter, which is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of twaine. For wee must obserue, not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:5179:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
those, that we Iudge in our owne conceits
to be good: but suche, as be currant by cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
&amp; vsed in our owne tyme: as lawes,
which we be bound to keepe, thoughe they
be not all of the best, tyll suche tyme, as the
magistrates, the Prince, or they that haue
power to amed them, haue chaunged them
to better.</p>
            <p>So that <hi>It behoues vs, hedefully to marke
the doings and speache, wherewith daily prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
and custome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bocc. Nouel. 6 Gior. 5. fo. 259</note> 
               <hi>wonteth to receaue, salute, &amp;

of people, and in all our familiar communicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
with men, let vs vse the same.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Peter the King of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</note> And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the <hi>Admerall</hi> (as peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ture the
maner of his time was suche) in his talke
with <hi>Peter</hi> the King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> did many
times: <hi>Thou</hi> him: Let vs yet saye to our
King: <hi>Your maiestie: and your highnes:</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
in speache as in writing. And if
they haue followed the vse of their time:
then let not vs breake the fashions of ours.
And these doe I call <hi>Duetifull Ceremonies,</hi>
bycause they proceede not, as we would, or
of our free willes: but are layde vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> vs
by the <hi>Lawes:</hi> I meane, <hi>Common custome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in suche things, as carry no euill mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in them, but rather some face of courtesie:
reason would and commaundeth, vve shoulde
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:5179:32"/>
rather obserue common Custome, then dispute
and lay the lawe for them.</p>
            <p>And albeit, to kisse in shewe of reuerence, of
very right appertayneth to the reliques of
<hi>Saints</hi> and there holy matters: yet if it bee
the maner of your country, at parting, to
say:<note place="margin">I kisse your hande: I am your seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t: your slaue in chayne.</note> 
               <hi>Signori, Io vi bascio la mano.</hi> Or: <hi>Io son
vostro seruidore:</hi> Or els: <hi>vostro schiauo in cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:</hi>
you must not disdaine it, more then
other. But, <hi>In farewelles and writings, you
must salute and take leaue, not as reason, but as
custome will haue you: and not as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> wont in
times past, or should doe: but as men vseat this
day:</hi> for it is a chorlishe maner to say: <hi>VVhat
greate gentleman is he I pray you, that I must
master him:</hi> Or: <hi>is he becom master parson, that
I must kisse his hands?</hi> for he that is wont to
be <hi>(Sird)</hi> and like wise <hi>(Sirreth)</hi> other: may
thinke you disdaine him, and vse some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
vnto him, when you call him to his
face, by his bare name, and giue him no
addition.</p>
            <p>And these termes of <hi>Seignory, seruice,</hi> &amp;
<hi>duetye,</hi> and such other like vnto these, as I
haue sayde: haue lost a greate parte of their
harshnes, and (as hearbes lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>g steepte in the

mouthes, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tinuall vse to speake them.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:5179:33"/>
So that we must not abhorre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, as some
rude and rusticall fellowes, full of foolishe
simplicitie, doe: that would fayne beginne
the letters we write to Kinges and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
after this sort. vz. <hi>Yf thou and thy

healthe:</hi> saying, that suche was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the letters, the <hi>Latins</hi> did write to
the magistrates of <hi>Rome.</hi> If men should
liue by their measure, and go backe to those
fashions and maners, our first fathers dyd
vse: the worlde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> by litle and litle, would
come so about, that we should feede vppon
acornes againe.</p>
            <p>And in these <hi>Duetifull Ceremonies,</hi> there
be also certain rules and precepts, we must
obserue: that wee may not bee touched w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <hi>Vainesse</hi> and <hi>Pride.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vanitie and pryde.</note> And first of all, wee
must consider the country where wee doe

               <note place="margin">Respect of countrey.</note> And peraduenture that

for the most part, with Mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts
and plaine gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, without any Prince,

that the braue and Lordelike manners of

the gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of <hi>Naples</hi> transported to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:</hi>

Albeit all that same countrie (if I bee not

            <p>But in some cases these <hi>Ceremonies</hi> be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

vnto them, as men that can ill spend their
thoughts one matters so vaine.</p>
            <p>Neither must handy crafts men, nor me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
of base condition, buisie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> selues to much,
in ouer solemne <hi>Ceremonies</hi> to greate men,
and Lordes: it is not lookt for in suche. For
they disdaine them, more then allowe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>:
because it seemes that in such, they seeke &amp;
looke, rather for obedience and duetie, then
honour. And therefore it is a foule faulte in
a seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, to offer his master his seruice: for
he cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts it his shame, &amp; he thinks the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
doth make a doubt, whether he is master or
no: as if it were not in him to imploy him,
&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d him too. These kinde of <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
would be vsed frankely. For, <hi>VVhat
a man dothe of duetie, is taken for a debte,</hi>
and hee finds him selfe litle beholding to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:5179:35"/>
him that doth it. But he that dothe more,
then he is bound to: it seemes he parteth
with somewhat, and that makes men to
loue him, and to commende him for a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
man. And I remember mee well, I
haue hearde it sayde, that a worthy <hi>Graecia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               </hi>
a greate versifier, was euer wont to saye:
that <hi>He that could skill to entertaine men with
a small aduenture, made a greate gayne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You shall then vse youre <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as
the tailer shapes his garments, rather to
large then to litle: but yet not so, that hee
cutteth one hose large inough to make a
cloke. And if thou doe vse in this point,
some litle gentle behauiour, to suche as be
meaner then thy selfe: thou shalt be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
lowly. And if thou doe asmuche to
thy betters: thou shalt bee sayde a Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
well taught,<note place="margin">Vanitie.</note> and courtious. But hee that
dothe herin to muche, and is ouer lauishe,
shalbe blamed as vaine and light: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
worse thought of too: counted a busie
body, a fidging fellowe, and in wife mens
sight, a flatterer: which vice, our elders
haue called, (if I doe not forget me) dowble
diligence. And there is no faulte in the
worlde, more to bee abhorred, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worsse
beseemes a gentleman, then this. And this
is the thirde maner of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:5179:35"/>
simply procedeth of our owne will, and not
of custome.</p>
            <p>Let vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ber, that <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> (as
I haue alwayes sayd) were not so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
by nature, but a man might doe well
inough without them: As for example, our
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>trie liued (it is not long since) in maner
cleane without any. But other mens di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases
haue infected vs, with these infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and many mo. So that, custome and
vse obserued: the rest that is more, is but
waste: and such a sufferable leesing, as if
it be more in deede then is in vse, it is not
only vnsufferable, but forbidden: and so
vppon, the matter, a cold and vnsauourie
thing to noble mindes, that cannot brouse
vppon shrubbes and shewes.</p>
            <p>And you shall vnderstand, that trusting
my owne skill but little, in wryting this
present treatise: I thought good to consult
with many, and to take the Iudgement of
better learned men then my selfe. And
this in my reading I finde. There was a
King, they call him <hi>Oedipus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Oedipus.</note> being bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
and driuen out of his countrie (vppon
what occasion I know not) he fled to King
<hi>Theseus</hi>
               <note place="margin">Theseus.</note> at <hi>Athens,</hi> the better to saue him
selfe and his life, from his enemies, that
mainely pursued him. This <hi>Oedipus</hi> now
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:5179:36"/>
comming before the presence of <hi>Theseus,</hi> by
good chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce hearing his daughter speake,
(whome he knew by her voice, for he was
blind and could not beholde her with his
eyes) he was so presently striken with ioy,
that, not tarying to doe his allegeau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce and
duetie to the King, he did prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tly embrace,
&amp; make much of his daughter before him:
his fatherly affection so led him, and rulde
him so. But in the end finding his fault,
and better aduising him selfe of his doings:
he would needs excuse it to <hi>Theseus,</hi> &amp; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
prayd his grace to pardon his folly. The
good and wise King, cut of his talke, and
bad him leaue his excuses, and thus saide
vnto him: <hi>Comfort thy selfe Oedipus, and bee
not dismayd at that thou hast done. For I will
not haue my life honoured with other mens
woordes, but with my owne deedes.</hi> Which
se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce a man should haue alwaies in mind.</p>
            <p>And albeit men be well pleased, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
doe giue them worship &amp; honour: yet when
they find them selues cuningly courted,
they be soone weary of it, and also disdaine
it. For these glauerings, or flatteries I
should say, to amend their knaueries &amp; false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoodes,
haue this fault withall: that these
glauering fellowes doe plainly shewe, they
count him, whome they court in this sorte,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:5179:36"/>
but a vaine, and arrogant bodie, an asse
of grose capacitie, and so simple, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it should
be an easie matter to bayte him and take
him too. And these <hi>Vaine and Curious Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
besides that they be superfluous: so they
beare with all a shape of flattery,</hi> so slenderly co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uered,
that euery man doth ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ly see them,
and know them plaine: in suche sorte, that
they that doe them, to the end to make a
gaine, besides that ill that is in them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I spake before: shewe them selues also,
gentlemen ill taught, without good maner
or any honest fashion.</p>
            <p>But there is another sorte of <hi>Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
people, who make it an arte and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise,
and keepe a booke and a reconing
of it. One these men (they say) they must
smile, on such men they must laughe: and, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
better man shall sit in the chayr, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vppon a lowe stoole: which supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<hi>Ceremonies,</hi> I beleue, were transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of <hi>Spaine</hi> into <hi>Italie.</hi> But our
country, hath geuen them but colde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement,
and as yet they haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
but slender roote here: for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
difference of worship, and gentry, is
not liked of, with vs. And therefore
it is but ill maner, for a man to make
him selfe Iudge, which is the better man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:5179:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>But it is much worse for a man to make
a sale of his <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts,

good wordes and faire countenaunces for

and the tyme, their seruaunts haue spent in
their seruice.</p>
            <p>And sure they that take a pleasure to vse

shewe they doe it vppon a lustines and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery,
as men that haue nothing elles in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
of any valour.</p>
            <p>And bycause these follies are learned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
ease inough, and carry withall a litle fayre
glose in shewe: they bestowe all their whole
mindes none other waye. But graue
matters they can not abide to weelde, as
things to farre aboue their reache: and
coulde finde in their harts to dwell in these
toyes and tryfles, as men whose capacitie

that these entertainments and acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce

            <p>And some againe be to full of words,

            <p>And such as vse to iest at a man, be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
lyke vnto these: I meane them that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:5179:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haue a good sport to mocke<note place="margin">Mockes.</note> and beguile me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,
not in spite or scorne, but on a meriment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twen a scorne and a mocke</note>
And you shall vnderstand, <hi>There is
no difference betvveene a scorne and a mocke:
but the purpose alone and intent a man hath, in
the meaning the one the other.</hi> For a man
mockes and laughes otherwhile, in a sport
and a pastime: but his scorne is euer in a
rage and disdaine. Although in common
speache and wryting, wee take the one
woorde sometyme for the other. But <hi>He
that doth scorne a man: feeleth a contentation
in the shame he hath done him:</hi> And hee that
dothe mocke, or but laughe: taketh no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation
in that he hath done: but a sport,
to be merry &amp; passe the time away: where
it would be, both a greefe and a sorrow, per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chaunce,
vnto him, to see that man receaue
any shame, by any thing he said or did vnto
him.</p>
            <p>And althoughe I profited litle, in my
<hi>Grammar</hi> in my youthe: yet I remember
that <hi>Mitio,</hi> who loued <hi>Aeschines</hi> so muche,
that he him selfe had wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>der at it: yet other
while, toke a sporte &amp; a pleasure to mocke
him: as when he said to him self: <hi>I vvill
go to giue him a mocke:</hi> so that, I must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre,
that the selfe same thing, done to the
very selfe same body: according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:5179:41"/>
of him that doth it, may be eyther a
mocke or scorne.</p>
            <p>And bycause our purpose, cannot be
plainely knowne vnto other men: it shall
not be good for vs to vse such parts, as
bring men in doubt and suspicion, what
our intent and meaning is in them: but
rather let vs eschewe them, then seeke to
be counted Iesters. For, <hi>It many times
chaunceth, in boording and Iesting, one tackes
in sporte, the othet strykes againe in earnest:</hi> &amp;
thus from playing, they come to fraying.
So, he that is familiarly mockte in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
recons it, otherwhile, to be done to
his shame &amp; dishonour, and therat he takes
a disdaine. Besides this, <hi>A mocke is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then a deceyte.</hi> And naturally, it gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
euery man to erre and be deceyued.
So that, many Reasons ther be to proue,
That <hi>He that seekes to purchase goodwill,
and be well thought of: must not make him
selfe to cunning in mockes and Iestes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very true, we are not able, in no
wise, to leade this paineful lyfe, altogether
without some pleasure and solace: And by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Iestes do geue vs some sporte, and
make vs merry, and so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>seque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tly refreash
our spirits: we loue them that be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt,
merry conceited, and full of solace.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:5179:42"/>
So that a body would thinke, I should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
persuade the contrarie: I meane, I
shoulde say: <hi>It is conuenient and meete in
company, to vse prety mockes, and otherwhile
some Iestes and taunts.</hi> And without doubt,
they that can slint after a friendly and ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
sort, be muche more made of, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
beloued then they that cannot skill or
haue no wit to doe it. Howbeit, it is neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in this, to haue a respect to many thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>gs.</p>
            <p>And forasmuche as it is the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t of him
that doth Iest: to make a sport and pastime
at his faulte, whome he doth loue and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme,
and of whom he doth make more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
a commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> account: it must be well lookte to,
that the fault, wherin his friend hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
be suche, as he may sustaine no slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or shame, or any harme by any talke or
Ieste he makes vppon it: otherwise, his skil
doth ill serue him, to make a good diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene a pleasaunt Iest, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
plaine wronge.</p>
            <p>And there be some men,<note place="margin">Bocc. Nouel. 8 Gior. 9. fo. 430</note> so short &amp; so testy,
that you must, in no wise, be merry, nor vse

cannot thinke that <hi>Lupo of Vberti</hi> did any
thing extenuat or lesse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> his shame: but rather
increaste it greater, by the Ieste that hee
made to excuse his faulte, and qualifie the

wherein he was besieged round about, and

<hi>where it is out of time for to laughe, there to

            </p>
            <p>And further, you shall vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d, there be

<hi>Lauretta</hi> gaue for that point, suffice to teach
you: That <hi>Iestes must bite the hearer like a
sheepe, but not like a dogge. For if it pinche,
as the byte of a dogge: it shalbe no more
a Ieste but a vvronge.</hi> And the lawes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in all countries, will, that who saith
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:5179:43"/>
any villanie vnto a man, shalbe greuously
punished for it. And, perchaunce, it were
not amisse, to prouide with all, some sharp
correction for him, that should byte in way
of iesting, beyond all honest measure. But
gentlemen should make account, that the
lawe that punisheth wronges, extendeth as
farre to iestes, and that they should seldome
or very easily nyp or taunt any man.</p>
            <p>And besides all this, you must vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d,
that a iest, whether it bite, or bite not, if it
be not fine &amp; full of wit, men take no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
at al to heare it, but rather are wearied
with it: or at least wise, if they doe laughe,
they laughe not at the iest, but at the iester
him selfe, that brings it forthe so colde.</p>
            <p>And bycause, <hi>Iestes be no other thing but
deceites: and deceite</hi> (as a thing that is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of subtilenes &amp; craft) <hi>cannot be wrought
but of men, that haue fine and redy wittes, and
very present:</hi> therefore they haue no grace
in men that be rude, and of grose vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

nor yet in them alwayes, that haue

looke in to the maners of many, you shall
easily see, this that I tell you is true: I

is prety and pleasaunt, there a man straite

and makes a kinde of admiration of it. So
that, where the company geues foorth no

meaning to eschewe: in this very woorde
it selfe (I beleue) sought to fide out another,
not thinking muche of his paynes (bycause
it lyked him wel) to seeke farre to borrow it
els where. And sayd:

                  <l>For mans offence and sinne in Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And albeit <hi>Dant</hi> the learned <hi>Poet,</hi> did set

a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> should allow well of him in doing so.
And sure, I would not cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cell you to make
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:5179:47"/>
him your <hi>Maister</hi> in this point, to learne A
<hi>Grace:</hi> forasmuche as he him selfe had none.
For, this I finde in a <hi>Chronicle</hi> of him.</p>
            <p>This Dant, was somewhat proude for his knowledge, scorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and disdainfull, and muche (as Philosophers be) without
any grace or courtesie: hauing no skill to behaue him selfe in
company.</p>
            <p>But to come to our purpose againe: I
say, our speache must be plaine: which will
be easie inough to doe: if you haue wit to
choose those wordes that be naturally bred
in our soyle: and with all not so olde w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Age,

for, in so doing, a man shall weene,
the matter it selfe is openly laide before
him: &amp; that it is not expressed with wordes,
but pointed foorthe with the finger. And
therefore we may more properly say: <hi>A man

               <note place="margin">Dant. 23. Infer.</note> And <hi>Dant</hi> did better

            </p>
            <p>Ther be some woordes more in this place to like effect,

For the Italians haue (as we haue, and all other

            <p>Besids these, there be some, that neuer
hould their tounge.<note place="margin">Talkatiue Fellovves.</note> And as the shippe
that sayles, doth not presently stand still,
by taking downe the sayles: So doe
they runne forward, as caried away with
a certaine brayde: and loosing the matter
of their talke, yet leaue not to babble, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
repeate that againe that is said, or els
speake still they cannot tell what.</p>
            <p>And there be other so full of babble, that
they will not suffer another to speake. And
as wee doe see otherwhile, vppon the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in the countrie where they thresh corne,
one Pullet pull the corne out of the others
beake: so doe they catche the tale out of his
mouth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beganne it, and tell it them selues.
And sure, suche maner of people, induce
men to quarell and fight with them for it.
For, if you doe marke it wel: <hi>Nothing moues
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:5179:54"/>
a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> sooner to anger: then when he is soudaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cut short of his will and his pleasure, be it of
neuer so little and small importaunce.</hi> As whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
you gape wide with yawning: another
should thrust his hand in your mouth: or
when you doe lift your arme redy to hurle
a stone: it is soudainly stayde by one that
stands behinde you. Euen then, as these
doings, and many moe like vnto these,
which tend to hinder the will and desire
of another (albeit but in way of sporte &amp;
of play) are vnseemely, and would be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed:
So in talke and communication
with men, wee should rather pull one, and
further their desiers, by what meanes
we can, then stop them and hinder them
in it.</p>
            <p>And therefore, <hi>If any man be in a redines to
tell his tale: it is no good maner to interrupte
him: nor to say that you doe knowe it vvell.</hi>
Or, if hee besprinckle his tale here and
there, with some prety lye: you must not
reproue him for it, neither in wordes nor
in gesture, as shaking your hed, or scow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
vppon him, as many be wont:
gloriously vaunting them selues, that
they can, by no meanes, abide the taste
of a Lye <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> But, this is not the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:5179:55"/>
reason of this, it is the sharpenes and sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernes
of their owne rusticall &amp; eager Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which makes them so venemous &amp;
bitter in all companies they come: that no
man cares for their acquaintance.</p>
            <p>Likewise, <hi>It is an illfauoured condition to
stop another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s tale in his mouth: and it spites
him asmuche, as if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> should take him by the
sleeue &amp; hould him backe, euen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> he is redie
to runne his course.</hi> And when another man
is in a tale, it is no good maner for you, by
telling the company some newes, &amp; draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their mindes to other matters, to make
them forsake him cleane, and leaue him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
For, it is an vncourtious parte for you
to leade and carry away the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>pany: which
the other (not you) hath brought together.</p>
            <p>And, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> tells his tale, you must
geue good eare vnto him: that you may not
say otherwhile, <hi>O what?</hi> Or, <hi>how?</hi> which is
many a mans fashion to doe. And this is
asmuch trouble and paine to him that spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth:
as to shoofle against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stones, to him
that goeth. All these fashions, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
that which may stoppe, and that
which may trauerse the course of another
mans talke, must be shunned.</p>
            <p>And, if a man tell his tale <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lowe like a

forwarde, nor lende him woordes, although
you be quicker in speache then hee. For,
many doe take that ill, and specially suche,
as persuade themselues they haue a Ioly
grace in telling a tale. For, they doe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
you thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ke not so well of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, as they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

that liue in greate wealth &amp; plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
would count it a greate reproche vnto
them, that a man should proffer them mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
as if they liued in lacke, &amp; were poore

               </gap>
must vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d, that, <hi>Euery man in his owne

for modestie sake he deny it.</hi> And I
cannot gesse how it cometh to passe, that
<hi>the veriest foole doth babble most:</hi> which ouer
muche prattle, I would not haue a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to vse, and specially, if his skill be but
scant in the matter in talke: Not onely,
bycause it is a hard matter: but, <hi>He must ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
in many faults that talkes muche:</hi> but also, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a man weenes, that, <hi>He that talkes all
the talke to him selfe, woulde (after a sorte) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
him self aboue them all that heare him, as a

therfore, <hi>It is no good maner for a man to take

               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:5179:56"/>
And in this fault, not men alone, but many
countryes fall into, so cackling and prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
that, woe be their eares that geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
hearing.</p>
            <p>But, as ouer muche babble makes a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
weary: so doth ouer muche <hi>Silence</hi>
               <note place="margin">Silence</note> procure
as greate disliking. For, <hi>To vse silence in

maner, asmuche a fault, as not to pay your share
and scot as other men doe.</hi> And as speache
is a meane to shewe men your minde, to
whome you speake: so, doth <hi>Silence</hi> againe
make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> wene, you seke to be vnknowne.
So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, as those people which vse to drinke

            </p>

had very good skill to doe it: shewing in

another: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might iustly &amp; due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be answerable y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one to the other: which
treatise of his, he named <hi>Regolo.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Regolo.</note> Meaning
to shewe, that according to that, all the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages

and the walles, are measured by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rules &amp;
precepts of that booke. But, for that it is a
muche easier matter to speake it, then to
worke it, or doe it: and besides that, <hi>The
greatest number of men, especially of vs that be
prophane and not learned, haue our senses much
quicker then our vnderstanding, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
better conceiue particular things and
Examples, then the generall propositions and
Syllogismes</hi> (which I might terme in plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
speache, <hi>Reasons</hi>) for this cause this

to the Nature of workemen: whose
capacities are vnfit and vnable to weeld
the weighte of generall Precepts and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:5179:57"/>
rules: and to declare more plainely, with
all his cunning and skill: hauing found out
for his purpose, a fine marble stone, with
muche labour and paine, he fashioned and
shaped an Image of it, as perfectly propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in euery parte and member: as the
precepts and rules of his treatise had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deuised. And as he named the booke,
so did he name that Image, and called it by
name of <hi>Regolo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, (and it pleased god) I would I
could but one parte of those twoe points,
which that noble <hi>Ingrauer &amp; worckeman</hi> I
speake of, had perfect skill and knowledge
to doe: I meane, that I could gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

them:</hi> it were now, to muche for me to doe.
For asmuch as, <hi>It is not inough to haue know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge
and Art, in matters concerning maners &amp;
fashions of men: But it is needefull withall, to
worke them to a perfect effect, to practise and vse
them muche: whiche cannot be had vppon rhe

            <p>But for all this, you must not make

that the rider makes them haue an easier

and growen to perfection, transformeth vs from

it is our owne Imperfection and not her

and good order in life.</p>
            <p>It is not then true, that there is not a

is guided and ruled by twaine:<note place="margin">Custome &amp; Reason, tvvoe brydles of Nature.</note> 
               <hi>Custome</hi> I

you a litle before: <hi>Reason without Custome

And therefore they shall doe well, to harke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

meanes, a man shall haue more time and
leasure to learne to be such as she teacheth,
and to become as it were a houshould ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt
of hers, and one of her trame: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
bycause <hi>The tender age, as pure and cleane,
doth easily receaue all Impressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s, and reteineth
more liuely, the colours vvherevvith she is dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
then vvhen a man comes to ryper yeares:</hi>
And also, bycause <hi>The things vvherein vvee

And for this cause, it is said that <hi>Diodato,</hi>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:5179:59"/>
of vtterance, would euermore bee the first

his Comedie: allthoughe they were all but
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>terfets vnto him, whosoeuer they were
that should haue spoken before him. But
he would not his voice should occupie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens eares, after they heard another
man speake. Although, in respect of his
doings, it were a greate deale Inferiour
to his. Seing then, I cannot agree my
workes and my wordes together, for those
causes I haue shewed you before, as <hi>Maes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro
Chiarissimo</hi> did: whoe had as good a skil
to doe it, as he had knowledge to teache it:
let it suffice that I haue tould in some part
what must be done, bycause I am not by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
meanes able to doe it in dede. <hi>He that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
in darkenes, may very vvell Iudge vvhat
comfort it is to enioy the benefit of light. And
by an ouer long silence, vve knovve vvhat plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
it is to speake:</hi> so when you beholde my
grose and rude maners: you shall better
Iudge, what goodnes and vertue there is
in courtions behauiours and fashions.</p>
            <p>To come againe then to this treatise,
which growes now to some end: wee say
that <hi>Those be good maners and fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s, which
bring a delight, or at least, offend not their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
their mynds, and conceits, vvith vvhom vve
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:5179:60"/>
liue.</hi> And of these, wee haue hitherto spoken
inoughe.</p>
            <p>But you must vnderstand with all this,
that, <hi>Men be very desirous of bevvtifull things,
vvell proportioned and comely. And of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet
things fovvle and ill shapen, they be as
squemish againe, on the other side.</hi> And this
is a speciall priuilege geuen to vs: that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures haue no capacitie, to skill
what bewtie or measure meaneth. And
therefore, as things not common w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beastes
but proper to our selues: we must embrace
them for them selues, and holde them dere:
&amp; yet those, much more, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> drawe nerest to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
knowledge of man: as which are most apt
and inclined to vnderstand the perfection
which Nature hath lefte in men.</p>
            <p>And albeit, it be a hard matter, to shewe
precisely, <hi>Bevvtie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bevvtie.</note> what maner of thing it is:
yet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you may haue so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>e marke, to know her

               <hi>VVhere iointly &amp;
seuerally, euery parte &amp; the whole hath his due
proportion and measure, there is Bevvtie. And
that thing may iustly be called fayer, in vvhich
the saide proportion and measure is found.</hi> And
by that I did once learne of a wise &amp; a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
man: <hi>Bevvtie</hi> he said, would consist but
of one, at the moste. And <hi>Deformitie</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deformitie.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywise,
measured her selfe, by <hi>Many.</hi> As
you may see by the faces of fayer &amp; goodly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:5179:60"/>
women. For, the euen lineaments and
due proportions of euery of them: seeme
to haue byn created &amp; framed by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and sight of one force alone. Which
cannot be thought in them that be foule &amp;
deformed. For, when you beholde a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,
that hath, peraduenture, bigge and bowle
eyes, a little nose, blubbe cheekes, a flat
mouth, an out chinne, &amp; a browne skinne:
you thinke straite that that face is not one
womans alone: but is moulded of many
faces, and made of many peeces. And yet,
you shall finde amongest them, some such,
whose partes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sidered alone by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>selues,
be very perfect to see to: but all set together,
be foule and ill fauoured: not for any other
cause, but that they be lineaments of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sayer women, and not of one: So that
a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> would weene, shee had borrowed her
partes, of this and that woman. And it
may be, that Painter that had all the fayer
maides of <hi>Calabria,</hi> naked before him: had
none other intent therein, then to iudge &amp;
discerne in many, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> partes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue, as it
were, borrowed heere one, &amp; there another,
of one, alone: to whome restoring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> eache
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was her right: imagining y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Venus</hi> bewty
should be such, and so proportioned: he set
him selfe to paint her.</p>
            <p>And, you must not thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>k, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this is to be seene
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:5179:61"/>
the faces, the partes, and the bodies of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
alone: but it happeneth more or lesse,
in speache, in gestures &amp; doings. For, if you
should chaunce to see a Noble woman gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius
and gallant, washing of cloutes in a
Riuer by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> highe waye side: Althoughe if
this were not, you might hapely passe away
by her, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> little heede to her perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> or state: yet
this would not brook you nor like you, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her
seruile doings doe shewe her more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> one.
For her state should answer her honourable
condition and calling. But her woorke
is suche, as is meete for women of base and
seruile life: &amp; although you shall feele, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yll sauour nor sent come from her, nor
heare any noyse that should offend you, nor
any thing els to trouble your minde: yet
the foule and filthy maner of doing it, and
the vnseemely act it selfe: will make you
muche to loathe it. You must then beware
of these fowle and vncomely behauiours,
asmuche, nay, more then of those other, I
haue spoken all this while. For, it is a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
matter a greate deale, to knowe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> a
man faulteth in these, then when he faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in them. Bycause, <hi>It is easie much, vve
see, to feele then to vnderstande.</hi> But yet, it
may chaunce otherwhile, that euen that
which offendeth the senses, may also offend
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:5179:61"/>
the minde: thoughe not altogether af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
one sorte,<note place="margin">Apparelling according to the Time.</note> as I haue told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
shewing you that <hi>A man must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell
him selfe, according to the fashions that
other men vse:</hi> that it may not be thought
he doth reproue and correct their doings:
The which thing offendeth most men that
seeke to be commended: And the wisest me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
that be, mislike it too. For, the garments
of the olde world, haue lost their date, for
men of this age and this season to weare.
And it is suche an ill shapen sight, to see a
man clad with other mens cloathes: that
a man would weene there would be a fray
betwene the doublet &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hose: their cloathes
doe sit, vppon them so vnto wardly.</p>
            <p>So that, many of those matters I haue
spoken of allredy, or peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ture all, might
be aptly rehersed here again: forasmuch as
this measure I speake of here, is not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in these thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>gs: nor the time, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place,
nor the worke, nor the worker, accorded &amp;
fitted together, so well as it should be. For
mens minds and fansies doe like it, &amp; take
a pleasure and delight in those things. But
I thought it good to apply &amp; speake these
matters, rather vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> badge, as it were,
of the Senses and desires: then properly
assigne them to the minde: that a man may
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:5179:62"/>
the more easily perceiue them: bycause <hi>It is
a naturall thinge, for euerie man to feele and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire:</hi>
but euery man cannot so generally
vnderstand, and especially that, whiche
we call bewtie, gallantnes or entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>It is not inoughe for a man, to doe things that
be good: but hee must also haue a ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>e, hee doe
them with a good grace.<note place="margin">A Grace, vvhat it is.</note> And a good grace is
nothing els, but suche a maner of light (as I may
call it) as shineth in the aptnes of things set in
good order and wel disposed, one with another:
and perfectly knit and vnited together. VVith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which proportion and measure, euen that
which is good is not faire: &amp; the fairenes it self,
is not plesaunt. <hi>And as meates, though they
be good &amp; sauourie will giue men no minde
to eate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, if they haue no pleasaunt relish
and taste: So fares it with the maners of
men other while (althoughe in them selues
in no respect they be ill, but foolishe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and fond) if a man doe not season them
with a certaine sweetenes, which you call
(as I take it)</hi> Grace, <hi>and</hi> Comlines.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that, euery vice of it selfe, without
any further matter to helpe it (it cannot
be chosen) must needes offend a man.
For,</hi> Vices be things so foule and filthie: that
honest and modest mindes, will greeue to see
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:5179:62"/>
their shamefull effects. <hi>And therefore,</hi> it shall
behoue them that seeke to be well thought of,
with their familiar acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce, aboue all things
els to eschewe vices, and especially those, that
be foulest and worst: as Leachery, Couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
Crueltie, and other. <hi>Of which, some be
beastly, as</hi> Drunkennes, and Gluttonie: some
vncleane, as Leacherie: other some horrible, as
Murther, and such other: all which for them
selues, and for the very naughtines, that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
in them al, all men eschewe more, or lesse:
<hi>But, as earst I said, generally al, as thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>gs
of greate disorder, make a man misliked
muche of all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, bycause I haue not taken vppon
me to shew vnto you, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s sinnes, but their
Errors: it shalbe no parte of my charge at
this time to entreate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Nature of vices &amp;
vertues: but onely of the seemely &amp; vnseeme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
fashions and maners wee vse one with
another. One of the which vnseemely
fashions was, that <hi>Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t Richard</hi>
               <note place="margin">Counte Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde.</note> did vse: of
which I tould you before. Which, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemely
and vnfitting with those other his
good and faire maners hee had besides:
that same worthie Bishop (as a skilfull
and cunning Mayster in musicke will ea-aesily
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:5179:63"/>
here a note out of Tune) had quickly
founde out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It shalbe then, necessarie for gentlemen and
men of good behauiour, to haue a regard to this
measure I speake of: in going, in standing, in
sitting, in gesture, in porte, in apparell, in talke,
in silence, in rest and in action.</hi> For, a man
must not apparell him selfe like a woman:
that the Attire may not be of one sorte, and
the person of another: as I doe see it in
some that weare their heads &amp; their beards
curled with bodkins,<note place="margin">Beardes and Heades cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with bodkins.</note> and haue their face,
and their necks, &amp; their hands, so starchte
and painted, that it were to muche for a

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
of it, and sets her selfe to the sale.</p>
            <p>You must smell,<note place="margin">Sweete smeles</note> neither of sweete nor of
sower: for a gentleman would not sauour
nastily like a begger: nor yet should a man
carry a sauour and sent about him, like a
harlot or whoore. I doe not by this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid,
but you may very well vse some sweete
smelles of sweete waters.</p>
            <p>Your apparell must be shaped according
to the fashion of the time,<note place="margin">Apparell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fashion &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>lling.</note> and your calling,
for the causes I haue shewed you before.
For, <hi>VVe must not take vppon vs to alter cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
at our will. For time doth beget them,
and time doth also weare them out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:5179:63"/>Euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> may applie those fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s, that
be in common vse, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moste to his owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage,
that he can. For, if perchaunce
your legges be very long, and men vse but
short garments: you may vse a meane, not
to long, nor to short. And if your legges
be to small, to greate, or crooked: make
not your hosen of to light and garishe a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
that it may not call men to looke and
to gawre vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> your deformitie. Thou must
weare no garment that shall be to light, or
ouermuche daubde with garding: that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
may not say, thou hast <hi>Ganymedes</hi> hosen, or
wearest <hi>Cupides</hi> doublet. But, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
it be thou wearest, let it be fit and well
made for thy bodie: least thou seme to braue
it, in another mans cloathes.</p>
            <p>But with all, thou must in any case res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
thy condition or estate. For, <hi>A man of
the Clergie, must not be attired like a Souldier:
nor a Souldier goe like a Player.</hi> When <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truccio</hi>
was in <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Lodouico Bauero</hi>
at a greate Pompe, and triumphe: who
was both Duke of <hi>Lucca</hi> and <hi>Pistoia,</hi> and
<hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Palazzo,</hi> and Senatour of <hi>Rome:</hi>
this <hi>Castruccio,</hi> being Lorde greate Mays<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the saide <hi>Lodouico Bauero</hi> his house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houlde:
for his brauery, made him a coate
of crimsin, vppon the brest wherof, there
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:5179:64"/>
was this deuise, in letters of Golde
<q>It is euen as God will.</q>
And vppon the backe behinde.
<q>And it shallbe as God will.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I beleeue, you thinke this garment,
would haue become <hi>Castruccio</hi> his Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter
better, then it could become him.</p>
            <p>And although Kings be free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> checke,
and may doe what they list: Yet, I could
neuer commend King <hi>Manfrede,</hi> Whoe
euer more vsed, to suite him selfe in greene.
Wee must then haue a care, that our appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
be not onely wel made for the bodie: but
that it be meete for our calling.<note place="margin">Apparel acor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Countrey</note> And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
it be suche, as the countrie doth vse,

            <p>These same feathers, which the <hi>Neapoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi>

that Citizens doe weare. But their

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:5179:64"/>
a greate deale worse. So that, looke what
hapely might be allowed in <hi>Verona,</hi> would
not, perchaunce, be suffered in <hi>Venice.</hi> For
as muche as these gallants, all begarded,
and huffing in fethers, &amp; warlike fellowes,
would not doe well, in this Noble Citie so
peacefull &amp; Ciuil. Suche kinde of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

            <p>I would not haue a gentleman to runne
