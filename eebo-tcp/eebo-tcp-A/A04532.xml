            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and ſhall ſée the writings bothe written

            <p>The ſaid Lord Duke may (thanks he to

<pb facs="tcp:454:8"/>
faithful and ſincere affection aduertiſed
his Maieſtie aſwel by letters and <hi>Emba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſadours</hi>
as by his Maieſties Meſſenger.</p>
            <p>Firſt béei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> hée warnded him
of the holy league, the frutes wherof, hée
may now euidently perceiue to be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contrary to the faith and reputation of
his Maieſtie and quietneſſe of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</p>
            <p>After being come, home by <hi>Prayllon</hi> him
ſelf (who is now héer preſent) hée gaue his
Maieſtie to vnderſtand of the true aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
which hee had receiued of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> drifts
and practiſes prepared for prouiding and
corrupting in each parte, and bringing
to the deuotion of thoſe whome wée doo
perceiue, ſuche as ſhould enioy the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of the Eſtates: that is to ſay, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
that no Eſtates ſhould be holden frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
lawfully and without reſpect of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
where at might be preſent (as at all
times aunciently they haue béen accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
the Princes of the blood, togither
with all ſuch as haue wherof to complain.
Moreouer the ſaid Lord Duke hath true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aduertiſed his maieſtie after what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the <hi>Edict</hi> of peace hath béene executed
<pb facs="tcp:454:8"/>
nothing is doon: that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eſtates haue béen
ordered in ſuch wiſe as already hée hath
béen aduertiſed: that the Princes of the
blood haue thervnto béen called to the end
to intrap them. How ſuch men haue béen
fauoured, as haue offered to lay houlde vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon
their Parſons, and to ſurpriſe thoſe
Townes where the Edict is lawfully and
fincéerely executed, togither with the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where thoſe of the Religion haue béen
forced to kéep them ſelues, and not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the ſame by reaſon of the euil execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Edict. Hée hath béen moreouer
truely aduertiſed of the othe lately made
to his Maieſtie, the Copye wherof was
ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marely deliuered to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid Lord of <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lequier,</hi>
a matter, to ſay trueth, horrible to
be knowen among men, and ſo ſtraunge
that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid Lord Duke could neuer haue
beléeued it, had not the continual and late
contrauenſions againſt the <hi>Edict</hi> moſte
manifeſtly declared y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, &amp; the Kings
propoſition made by the ſaid <hi>Villequier</hi>
fully confirmed it, as alſo the ſaid matters
doo ioyntly cauſe the ſaid Lord Duke to
beleeue that his Maieſties determination
is correſpondent to the declaration of the
<pb facs="tcp:454:9"/>
aforeſaid Lord of <hi>Villequier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howbeit the ſaid Lord Duke truſteth
that in aſmuch as it is a month ſince the
departure of the ſaid Lord of <hi>Villequier,
God</hi> hath otherwiſe inſpired his Maieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and cauſed him to ſmel out this poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
counſail, togither with the vanitie of
the offers of theſe pretended Eſtates, to
the end to put his Maieſtie in minde, yea
to cauſe him, euen as it were with his fin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger
to touch that which héertofore wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ripely, hée hath had in woorthy
conſideration, which alſo his faithfull and
truely affected Seruants and Fréends not
only in <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> but alſo through out <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome,</hi>
haue manifeſted vnto him,
which alſo finally neceſſitie it ſelf hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to vnderſtand, not only to his Maieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
but to his Predeceſſors, by ſo much
experience when they haue endeuoured
(but euer in vain) to root out the reformed
Religion, and all exerciſe of the ſame by
warres, perſecutions, and other meanes,
euen horrible to be reherſed, which the
ſaid Lord Duke could not ouer paſſe, by
reaſon of the ſincere affection which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to the conſeruation of the mightines
<pb facs="tcp:454:9"/>
of his Maieſtie: And to the end to ſée him
at peace w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his Subiects, the way is, to ſet
before his Maieſties eyes this litle whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch
followeth.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that it may pleaſe his Maieſtie to
call to minde the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſail of <hi>Gamaliel</hi> that
againſt that which commeth of <hi>God,</hi> no
power or practiſe of man can preuaile: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
that whatſoeuer is not of <hi>God:</hi> waſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th
and periſheth of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in matters of eſtate that is
good, which is neceſſary, wherin his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
may looke in the looking glaſſe of
<hi>Germany, Poland, Hungary, Boheme,
Suiſſerland,</hi> and the <hi>lovv Country,</hi> not
as things are cloked: but according to the
trueth, as him ſelf hath ſéen, for to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
a Prince of <hi>Germany</hi> with his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
or with all <hi>Fraunce</hi> is an abſurde
thing, but to compare <hi>Fraunce,</hi> with all
<hi>Germany:</hi> is an equall proportion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that his Maieſtie perceiueth
that all the ſame Contries doo flooriſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they haue found meanes to content
the conſciences of their ſubiects, by whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch
Examples his maieſtie may knowe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
not the permiſſion of the Religion, but the
<pb facs="tcp:454:10"/>
hinderaunce of the exerciſe of the ſame,
hath engendred the miſchéefs and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which now he beholdeth through all
his Realme.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that his Maieſtie not béeing
able to confirme the laſte peace without
his <hi>Edict</hi> of Pacification, and not béeing a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble
to kéepe that without maintaining the
ſame and putting it in execution: hée may
plainly ſée that, the maintenance of his
Edict is the only fundation, and meanes
of peace, yea it is the very peace it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, like as the vpholding therof is a
meane of peace and auoiding warres, ſo
is it the only way wherby his maieſtie
may recouer the obedience of his ſubiects:
for it is a thing moſt certain y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> a King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Captain of any faction among his
ſubiects, can neuer be wel obeyed, for it is
requiſite y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hée ſhould ſhew him ſelf a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Father to all his Subiects, in endeuo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring
to reconſile them one to an other.</p>
            <p>Alſo ſixtly to deale and ſweare againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
vpholdi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g therof, is the only meane to bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
his maieſties ſubiects in greater miſtruſt
then before, and ſo to areare more cruel
warre then before time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:454:10"/>
Seuenthly to alleadge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoueraigne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie
of a King for the dooing or ſwering
to ſuch matters, to bring his maieſtie vnto
a perpetuall rebuke among all the world,
wherby he ſhall be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted a Prince void
of all faith, lawe, honor and vertue. For
his maieſtie may call to minde how often
he hath bothe by woord and writing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
himſelf to be a true Prince, ſuch a
one as wil promiſe nothing but what he
entende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h to performe, yea and mindeth
rather to promiſe nothing, ſo that no man
of honour can otherwiſe conclude but that
either he ought not to haue made the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> edict: or elſe he ought to obſerue
it, as his maieſtie in his owne perſon hath
vſed to ſay.</p>
            <p>For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eighth eſpecially the Lord <hi>Duke</hi>
aſſureth him ſelf that his maieſty may wel
perceiue that with any man who would ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerue
the coute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of their othe, or folow the
counſail of theſe pretended ſtates which is
no other then the othe it ſelfe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
it had neuer béene ſworne: it
would be vnpoſſible to haue any trafique,
becauſe that neither worde, promiſe, othe,
obligation, ſeale, or other thing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:454:11"/>
ordinary and lawfull for the aſſurance
of faith among men, eſpecially betwéen the
Prince and his ſubiects, conſidering the
imbecilitie of the ſaid ſubiects, would be of
any more force, but contrariwiſe ſhould
ſerue only for nets and ſnares wherwith
to entrap eche other.</p>
            <p>Ninthly his Maieſtie ought to conſider
that neighbours and ſtraungers cannot
aſſure them ſelues of that Prince, whoſe
ſubiects cannot truſt him, as they of the
Religion, who haue ouermuch béene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded.
For to ſhowe that they began not:
we néede no other argument then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the ſaid Lord of <hi>Villequier,</hi>
namely that the King is not minded to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
the principall point of his <hi>Edict.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As touching the example of the Quéene
of <hi>England,</hi> it is ſufficiently knowen that
that Ladyes hart is ſuch, as if ſhée had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
her ſubiects found ſuch numbers of
Princes, Lordes, gentlemen and others of
the Romaine Religion within her domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
who ſhould as his Maieſties ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
haue doon, ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue requeſted her,
rather than to haue incurred ſuch ſpoyles,
and once onely falſifyed her faith and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb facs="tcp:454:11"/>
her maieſtie would haue permitted
them the exerciſe of their Roomiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>Tenthly that his maieſtie ſhould beare
at the leaſt aſmuch affection vnto his owne
Subiects, as he hath ſhewed vnto the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
of the lowe Countryes, in reioyſing
with them for the determination that they
haue taken, for the recouery of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
hauing alſo béene a mediatour to the
ſaide Eſtates for the reſtoring againe of
the Countie of <hi>Egmonde</hi> into his eſtates
and honours, wherin he hath the more to
conſider of the pollicie of the Spaniarde,
who ſéeketh nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g but to continue warres
in Fraunce, to the end thereby to turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the tempeſt from his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes
after his good and vſuall maner.</p>
            <p>Finally, whereas his Maieſtie allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
that willingly hée would leaue his
Subiects the libertie of their conſciences:
that were much more to be miſtruſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is moſte vndoubted, that hée who
can liue without exerciſe of his Religion,
is vtterly deuoyd of all conſcience, ſo that
it is as much as if his maieſtie ſhould ſay,
I will graunt my ſubiects their liues, but
<pb facs="tcp:454:12"/>
in the meane time he ſhould take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them
their foode, wherein the Papiſts doo ſhowe
a ſufficient argument that they cannot
liue without Maſſe, ſo that the ſaid Lord
Duke cannot giue his Maieſtie any better
counſaile, except that if hée minde to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
a King, and to ſhow him ſelf ſuch a
Prince that a man may deale and trafique
and truſt to his maieſtie, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
his Edict, and obſerue his faith in
procuring the abuſes of theſe pretended E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
(wherof his maieſtie ſpeaketh) to be
refourmed by ſuch meanes as ſhall be
thought reaſonable, for the ſaid aſſembly
cannot be taken for true, frée, and lawfull
Eſtates, but rather for traytors to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
&amp; his crowne, neither are they y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
promiſed by the Edict, for they ſhould
be kept for the maintenaunce and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the peace, but not for the ſubuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thereof, to which end they haue moſte
vilanouſly béene ſubbourned, as many
times his Lordſhip hath aduertiſed his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie.
The rehearſall of all which things
the ſaid Lord Duke could very well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare,
were he not conſtrayned as well by
the plaineſſe of his conſcience and honour
<pb facs="tcp:454:12"/>
which is engaged in the ſubſcription of the
peace, as alſo by reaſon of the ſingular affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which he beareth to the commoditie,
aduauncement and ſeruice of his maieſtie,
in which minde he will continue all his life
time, hauing nothing in more reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then to bring to the crown of Fraunce,
and the tranquilitie of his maieſties ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
what ſo euer meanes or counſaile
God ſhall euer giue him without ſparing
ought, which the ſaid Lord Duke moſte
humbly deſireth his maieſtie to beléeue, and
for ſuch a one to account him, placing him
in the number of his moſte faithfull and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
fréends and ſeruants.</p>
            <p>This is all which the ſaid Lord Duke
can imparte to his maieſtie, in ought that
appertaineth to his perſon. But as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his armie that was in Fraunce,
the ſaid Lord Duke, his <hi>Colonels, Reyſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſters</hi>
and <hi>Captains,</hi> hauing héeretofore
thought it ſtraunge that his maieſtie kept
not with them the promiſes which he had
bothe made and ſo often reitreated vnto
them, as well at <hi>Francfort</hi> as at <hi>Stras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough</hi>
touching their payment and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages,

ſtraunge, and a matter almoſte impudent,
that ſuch a Lord as the Lord of <hi>Villequier</hi>
comming into theſe partes as Embaſſador
for his maieſtie, hath not onely not brought
any aſſuraunce of the ſame: but alſo not ſo
much as is ſpoken thereof ſaui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g by the way
yea and which is more, that the effect of
his meſſage is vtterly repugnaunt vnto
the Obligations and promiſes of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie.</p>
            <p>Therfore the ſaid Lord Duke, not in his
owne name only: but alſo in the name of his
whole armie requireth his maieſtie to haue
regarde to his honour and to kéep faith and
promiſe wherby at the next faire at <hi>Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte</hi>
aſwel the ſaid Lord Duke, as alſo his

for the perfect accompliſhment of your

were promiſed, ſhould entreate vpon ſome

of I wot not what league. This (to be

ought to buy the firme eſtabliſhment thereof
with their owne blood, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be other

            <p>We haue no commiſſion (for your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie

            <p>Séeing therefore that my Lord the Duke

hath in declaration of his goodnes towarde
you, béen honoured with goodly lands, a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a charge of a hundred men of armes, &amp;
an eſtate of <hi>Colonel,</hi> which dignities he yet

            <p>At ſuch time as Fraunce was repleniſhed

ſuppoſed vs not to be ſo attentiue thereto, as
<pb facs="tcp:454:19"/>
in effect we haue declared our ſelues, ſaide
that the ſame was the onely way to collect
money for our payments, becauſe ſay they
that the charges of war were infinite and
incredible, whereby it muſt néeds followe
that the breaking of the peace dooth cut of &amp;
take away all meanes of our ſatiſfaction, ſo
as we gather that we haue therin as great
intereſt, or more then many great Lords of
your ſubiects, and therefore that it is our
duetie moſt humbly to exhorte your maieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to the entertayning and aſſured obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

duetie of Chriſtian charitie, the ſimpatie

either the deſire y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue that your

to repoſe in your ſhould in no wiſe be demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.
There is none but knoweth (it is

it coſt before you could attain to this peace.</p>
            <p>All good Frenchmen wiſhed it, or iudged
it moſt profitable and neceſſary for your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
your people accepted it and ioyfully
receiued it, it was ſigned, ſealed, ſworne,
and publiſhed throughout all the Courts,
Bayliwickes, Townes, and places of this
Realme, and notified vnto ſtraungers by
your Embaſſadors, vnto the ſingular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation
of ſuch as wiſhed the wealth of
your Eſtate. Finally no neceſſary ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
was ommitted. We haue, enioy and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſeſſe
the lands, commodities and honours
which you haue conferred vnto my ſaid L.
the Duke <hi>Iohn Caſimire,</hi> for vnder any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

we eſtéeme more then all, we haue your

            <p>Now that we ſhould reape the frutes of
this peace, and receine that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
&amp; dew vnto vs, alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all men ſhould
congratulate with your maieſtie for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you ſhould finde, we muſt chaunge
<pb facs="tcp:454:20"/>
ſuch ſpéeches into a bewayling of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes
aryſing of warres.</p>
            <p>At the leaſt if the deſtenie of Fortune be
ſuch, either of royall and abſolute authoritie,
either for certaine conſiderations to vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen,
as we y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be Germains are to rude to
vnderſtand them, and our ſelues not open i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to comprehend that your maieſtie wil
not that your ſubiecte ſhould inioy the frute
of the Edict of pacification, then let it remain
cloſed within the boundes of your Realme,
and not be diſperſed in all corners of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
and in moſt parte of <hi>Svvizerland,</hi> for we
cannot, but muſt néedes receiue much gréefe
and intollerable damage thereby.</p>
            <p>This conſideration togither with infinite
others, which to this purpoſe might be allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by ſuch as would enter into the view of
your eſtate, doo to vs ſéem ſufficient to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
or at the leaſt ſuſpend this aboliſhment
of the Edict, vntill we be ſatiſfyed, and then
might you more iuſtly alledge that we haue
not to doo to meddle therein, for now we deal
with that that concerneth our ſelues, our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and credit, togither with the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our whole nation.</p>
            <p>Yet if it were but a matter of fiue or ſix
<pb facs="tcp:454:20"/>
moneths labour, the end whereof we might
then finde, and that it might ſo be eaſely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed,
then were there ſome hope as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our particular intereſt. But we now are
certaine and well aſſured, that if we be once
entred aborde this warre: we be all ready o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
olde to ſee the end.</p>
            <p>It is no ſmall matter when a man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to theſe extremities, that he wil rather
ouerthrowe him ſelfe and others, then with
his goods to looſe both Countrie, honour, and
life, when a man procéedeth ſo farre, it is
doon, all reſpect and all duetie of one ſide, and
other vaniſheth away. The politike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and the refourmed, each of them forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
him ſelfe, whatſoeuer tendeth either to
the one or other end ſéemeth lawful. Such as
haue abidden theſe extremities the ſpace of
xv. or xvj. yéeres, will not be daunted with
ſuch beginnings, hauing ſo many intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and good aduertiſements from all partes,
we know it: for we haue frequented it. There
muſt be a whole ſtorehouſe of money, beſides
the ſhedding of the French blood. There will
enſue a ſtiffe determination of irreconſilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
war, while in the meane time what will
become of our payments, the wayting for
<pb facs="tcp:454:21"/>
which, will be vnto vs as gréeuous &amp; intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,
as it wil be harde to ſend the ſame
into <hi>Germany</hi> (ſo long as the warre dooth
laſt) or eaſy to ſubdue the <hi>Huguenots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What wil our Reyſtres and ſouldiers,
who are determined to méete at the next
faire of <hi>Francfort,</hi> ſay. I wil leaue to ſuch as
knowe what maner of men they be in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
touching payments due. What will be
the general iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our forrain neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours?
The ſobereſt will ſay that Fraunce
which in all ages hath borne away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> price
of humanitie towarde ſtraungers, is now
become impatible to it ſelfe, neither able to
abide peace, neither to maintaine war.</p>
            <p>To conclude we doo beſéech your maieſtie
on the part of my Lord the Duke <hi>Iohn Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimire,</hi>

            <p>This Sir is (without ſpeaking any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the effect of all that we are commaunded to
