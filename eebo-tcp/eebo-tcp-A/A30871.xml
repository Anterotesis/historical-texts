            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Storming or Totall Routing
OF
TYTHES,
Or the humble Repreſentation, Declartion
and Proteſtation of EDWARD BARBER, in behalf
of himſelf and many thouſands of the Freemen of
the Common-wealth of England.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Heweth that whereas at the beginning of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
upon the conſideration of the abuſe done by
the Prelates and their adherents to this Nation, both
concerning the ſouls and bodies of the people, the
Parliament was pleaſed to put forth a Proteſtation,
wherein themſelves and the Kingdom amongſt other
things did proteſt to defend and maintain with life,
power and eſtate the true reformed Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
expreſſed in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> againſt all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
and Popiſh Innovations contrary to the ſaid Doctrine, the lawfull
rights and liberties of the Subjects (or rather the freemen of <hi>England</hi>) and
(note this) every perſon that maketh this Proteſtation in whatſoever he ſhall
do, in the lawfull perſuance of the ſame, and to their power, and as far as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
they may, oppoſe, and by all good waies and means endevour to bring
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40773:4"/>
to condign puniſhment all ſuch as ſhall either, by force, practice, Counſels,
Plots, Conſpiracies, or otherwiſe, do any thing to the contrary of any
thing in this preſent Proteſtation contained, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo in the Explanation thereof, it is ſaid that whereas ſome doubts
have been raiſed by ſeveral perſons out of this Houſe, concerning the
meaning of theſe words contained in the Proteſtation, lately made by the
Members of this Houſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The true reformed Proteſtant Religion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> againſt all Popery and
Popiſh Innovations within this Realm contrary to the ſame Doctrine, this
Houſe doth declare that by theſe words, was and is meant onely the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Doctrine profeſſed in the ſaid Church, ſo far as it is oppoſite to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Popiſh Innovations [and that the ſaid words are not to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the maintaining of any form or Worſhip, Diſcipline or Governd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor of any Rites or Ceremonies of the ſaid Church of <hi>England]</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
that what perſon ſoever ſhall not take the Proteſtation, is unfit to
bear Office in the Church or Common-wealth again.</p>
            <p>2. Again by the Vow and Covenant, we are injoyned for the defence
of the true Proteſtant Religion and Liberties of the Subjects, and this is
made in the preſence of Almighty God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. We are ingaged in the Reformation of the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Government, to have it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Word of God, and the example of the beſt Reformed
Churches.</p>
            <p>4. That we ſhall without reſpect of perſons, to wit, from the Prelate to
the Sexton, in like manner endevour the exterpation of Popery, &amp; Prelacie,
that is, Church-government by Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, their Chancelours
Commiſſaries, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Arch-Deacons, and all other
Eccleſiaſticall Officers depending upon that Hirarchy (which theſe
Prieſts extent do) Superſtition, Hereſee, Schiſme, Prophaneneſſe, and
whatſoever ſhall be ſound to be contrary to ſound Doctrine [and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

danger to receive of their Plagues. <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 4.</p>
            <p>The performance of which Proteſtation and Covenant concerning the

conſcientious men hath been often deſired, as by the Declaration of the
Army, and Petitions of diverſe Countries to the <hi>Houſe may appear,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now foraſmuch as the Lord ſaith Eccleſ. 5. 4. 5. <hi>When thou voweſt a
vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleaſure in fools: pay therefore
that which thou haſt vowed; better is it that thou ſhouldſt not vow, then that thou
ſhouldſt vow and not pay. And</hi> Deut. 23. 21. When thou ſhalt vow a vow
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40773:4"/>
unto the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt not ſlack to pay it; for the Lord thy
God will ſurely require it of thee, and it would be ſin in thee. Compared
with verſ. 22. 23. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 11. Vow and pay unto the Lord your God
This <hi>David</hi> performs <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 66. 13. 14. I will go into thy houſe with
burnt-offerings, I will pay thee my vows which my lips have uttered, and
my mouth hath ſpoken when I was in trouble.</p>
            <p>For the not performing whereof, I believe with <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Land now
mourneth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 10. And <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 14. They have alſo healed the hurt
of the daughter of my people ſlightly, ſaying, peace, peace, when there is
no peace. Compared with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 15, 16. The Prophet that teacheth lies,
he is the tail; for the leaders of this people cauſe them to erre: And they
that are led by them are deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>1. They Preaching for hire, and divining for money; and yet will lean

upon us, <hi>Micha.</hi> 3. 11. Pulling down poor Wooden and ſtone Croſſes,
and yet leaving that cruel Popiſh burthenſome Croſſe of their Prieſts and

            <p>2. Obſerve that whoſoever ſhall ſubmit to and receive any Miniſtery,
ordained by virtue of a forraign power from <hi>Rome,</hi> is a Traytor by the
known declared Laws of this Land: Now whether men receiving their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination

branches, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. Ye ſhall know them by their fruits, do men gather
grapes of thorns, or figgs of thiſtle? And have not the Miniſtery of <hi>England</hi>
their ordination from <hi>Rome?</hi> As by their Book of ordination appears, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

with the free-will-offrings of the Nation, bloud and taxations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
this, to wit, Ordinances for Tythes, with treble damages for thoſe
who much like <hi>Eliahs</hi> ſons 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 13. to the 17. who came with a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40773:5"/>
fleſh-hook of three teeth in his hand, while the fleſh was in ſeething, and
he ſtrook it into the Pan or Kettel or Cauldron or Pot; all that the fleſh-hook
brought up the Prieſt took for himſelf; alſo before they burnt the fat
the Prieſts ſervant came, and ſaid to the man that ſacrificed, give fleſh to
roſt, for the Prieſt, for he will not have ſodden fleſh but raw, and thou
ſhalt give it me now, and if not, I will take it by force, (note this.) The like
is theſe mens practice whereby they rob Chriſt of his Honour &amp; Prieſthood,
poor people of their goods, and without repentance, of their ſouls, as <hi>Iſa. 9.
16. Revel.</hi> 14. 9. 10. But would theſe conſider <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 1, 2, 3. The
Prieſts, the Levites, were to have no part nor inheritance with Iſrael; but
were to eat the offrings of the Lord made by fire: and his inheritance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhall they have no inheritance amongſt their brethren; the Lord is their
inheritance, as he hath ſaid unto them. But if theſe Prieſts will be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
and do the work, ſlay the Beaſts <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. 13. Then ſhall
they have the wages <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 1. 2, 3. the ſhoulder, the two Cheeks and
Maw alſo, the Tyth of the increaſe <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 22. But out of that muſt be
relieved the Levite; becauſe he hath no inheritance; and the ſtranger, and
the fatherleſſe, and the widow, verſ. 29. which theſe men perform not in
the leaſt, neither were they to take Tythes of any but of their brethren the
Jews, not of us Gentiles, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 5.</p>
            <p>4. Chriſts Miniſters, Ambaſſadors, or the ſervants of the Churches muſt
be content with their Maſters wages, and not to trouble the Civil Mage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
to have Statute-Laws or Ordinances of Parliament to ſtrain on mens
goods, or have them committed to Priſon without Bayl or Mainprize, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they pay treble damages beſides coſts and charges, the which hath been
inflicted on divers to the utmoſt; whereas for the dueſt debts men are ſo
tortured in Law, that many chooſe rather to looſe their debts, then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the torture of the Laws as they are now adminiſtred, wherein this
Clergy makes good that Scripture <hi>Revel.</hi> 9. 10. In making the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
the Tayl of the Beaſt; for their ſtrength is in their Tayles, and with
them do they hurt, to wit, force and ſtrain mens conſciences and goods;
and therefore if theſe men and the Synod would have given themſelves to
have truly Tranſlated the Bible, knowing there be many groſſe Errours,
they would have much diſcovered the myſtery of iniquity and their own
deceits, done the beſt ſervice they could to this <hi>State,</hi> brought much glory
to God as <hi>Balaam</hi> did in acknowledging the Truth, dealing plainly with
King <hi>Balack,</hi> who told his ſervants that if he would give him his houſe full
of ſilver and gold, he could not go beyond the word of the Lord to do leſſe
or more, deſiring to die the death of the righteous, and that his laſt end
might be like theirs, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 18. 38. and 27. 8. 10. which if theſe had
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40773:5"/>
done, thus they would have brought much glory to God and peace to
this bleeding nation.</p>
            <p>As by experience with us is manifeſted, as formerly cauſing the Civil
Magiſtrate to oppreſſe the Conſcience and take away the life of many, as in
Queen <hi>Maries,</hi> Queen <hi>Eliſabeths</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> his dayes, whoſe
bloud I fear lies fall on this nation, as <hi>Barrows, Greenwoods</hi> and <hi>Penries</hi> &amp;c.
Alſo who ſtirred up the King againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> and againſt the Parliament;
but thoſe unclean ſpirits like froggs, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 13. 14. being the ſpirits
of Devils working Miracles, that go out unto the Kings of the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi>
Conſider again their practice at <hi>Zion</hi> Colledge, and their morning Lectures,
Courts of Juſtice, yea, at the Parliament and Committees where they like
Locuſts ſwarm; And therefore note that as Judgement is to be powred
forth upon the nations in general that have given their power to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up or upholding that <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> without ſubmitting and
turning to Chriſt by Repentance; ſo upon them in eſpecial, they having
been the Inſtruments whereby they with the Nations their Kings and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
have been made drunck and committed fornication, with the Whore,
and therefore ſhall the Jndgements of God be powred fourth upon them,
as <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 12. to the 14. and 18. 9, 23, 24. Compared with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 12.
For that Nation and Kingdom that will not ſerve thee ſhall periſh, yea
thoſe Nations ſhall be utterly waſted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 38 to his Miniſters as ye go preach, ſaying, The
Kingdom of heavenis at hand. Heal the ſick, cleanſe the Lepers, raiſe the dead,
and caſt out Devils, freely ye have received, freely give, compared with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
4. 9. to the 12. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 33. 34. where the Apoſtle ſaith, I have coveted
no mans ſilver nor gold, nor Apparel; yea, you your ſelves know that
theſe hands have miniſtred to my neceſſities, and to thoſe that were with
me, I have ſhewed you all things, how that ſo labouring ye ought to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the weak, and to remember the words of the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> how he ſaid
it is more bleſſed to give then to receive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> compared with 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 9.
and 2 <hi>Theſ. 3. 8. 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 14. 15. or as <hi>Fox</hi> in his <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monuments</hi>
ſaith, The maintenance of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> is the pure Alms of the Church;
but have not they, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Jews, Mat.</hi> 15. 6. 9. made the
word of God of no effect by their traditions?</p>
            <p>Now conſider the vaſt difference between the Commiſſion and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Chriſt to his Miniſters and Servants, <hi>Mat. 28. 18. 19. 20. Mark</hi>
16. 15. 16.</p>
            <p>And the ſeveral Cannons, Statute-Laws, and Ordinances of <hi>Parliament</hi>
to their <hi>Miniſters:</hi> as alſo the adminiſtration thereof; and know that their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40773:6"/>
Servants you are, to whom ye yield your ſelves Servants to obey, whether
the Church and State of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. It being againſt or beyond the Law of the Land, every free man of
<hi>Englands</hi> Birth-right, to be ſo by them tyranized over for Tythes, it being
firſt given for the maintenance of <hi>Prelates, Prieſts, Abbots, Moncks,</hi> and
<hi>Friers,</hi> as in the councel of <hi>Lateren.</hi> But now God having diſcovered
them to be <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> and Popiſh; ſo alſo muſt be their maintenance,
there being not one word of God for it, but was taken by force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
or given for ſuperſtitious Tithes of the ſame nature, Popiſh and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian,
and more burthenſome and oppreſſive then <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi>
golden Image was to the <hi>Jews,</hi> which he ſet up in the plain of <hi>Dura;</hi> for
although he required worſhip from them to his Idol, yet not maintenance
for the Idol-Prieſts.</p>
            <p>6. That theſe men, as their Fathers have uſually been, ſtill are the cauſe
and fomenters of the troubles, and ruine of all or moſt Nations where
they come or have any power, as by experience with us is manifeſted.</p>
            <p>7. Divers faithful Subjects, and good Common-wealthsmen, have been
forc't through (their) tyranny to leave the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r houſes and Kingdom, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
rather to expoſe themſelves to a deſart Wilderneſs, then to endure that
miſery at home, by them forc't upon their bodies and minds, others ſhut
up in priſon ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l they have paid treble damages; beſides Priſon Fees and
Charges, yea ſome loſt their lives, others having their Cattel ſtrained on,
and for legal replying them committed to priſon; yea, the Bayliffs and
Atourney fined for their proſecuting the ſame according to Law, who
paid 61. per peece by force to eſcape impriſonment: this was done by
the means of the good Lord <hi>Say,</hi> and the houſe of Lords in <hi>Browns</hi> of
<hi>Hanworths</hi> buſineſs.</p>
            <p>So that from what hath been ſaid it doth clearly appear, that although
we are freed from <hi>Prelacy,</hi> Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> with divers other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
yet do their Sonnes ſucceed in cruelty, they being as like their
Fathers as ever they can look, or <hi>Rheoboam-like,</hi> exceeding in cruelty: their
little finger (as his) being thicker then their Fathers loynes, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.
10.</p>
            <p>And although <hi>Henry 8, Edward</hi> 6. &amp; Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> took away part of
the ſaid Orders; yet as then the maintenance thereunto belonging was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
and inforced from the people: even ſo now this burthen of tythes,
ſtill continues and cleaves cloſe unto us; and that not only on our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
and eſtates, but upon our Conſciences; for if this Popiſh Ordinance
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40773:6"/>
be continued, for we can judge it no other, being inſtituted, as before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for the maintenance of <hi>Prelates, Prieſts, Monks</hi> and <hi>Fryers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If this we ſay be continued to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> who received Orders from
them, as to the ſaid Orders before, then are we forced ſtill to <hi>Popery,</hi> and
<hi>Popiſh</hi> Innovations, no leſſe ſinful then the others.</p>
            <p>And whether this be not a breach of our Proteſtation, Oaths, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
which we have made with hands lift up to the moſt high God, we
refer to all judicious men to judge: And whether theſe are not ſuch as the
Prophet ſpeaks of, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31. 32. 33. And they come unto thee as the
people cometh, and they ſit before thee as my people, and they hear thy
words, but they will not do them; for with their mouth they ſhew much
love, but their heart goeth after their covetouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, we deſire to declare as believers, Chriſtians &amp; free men
of <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as he hath ordained another Miniſtry,
then that under the Law: ſo alſo hath he appointed another maintenance
for the Goſpel-Miniſtry then Tythes; there being not one word in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
for it, they being to live upon their own hand-labor, as before ſhewn,
or the peoples free gift, <hi>Mat</hi> 10. 8. And to eat ſuch things as they have
by their labor, or is ſet before them, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 7. 8. For the Workman is
worthy of his meat, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 9.</p>
            <p>Alſo the firſt dayes collection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1. 2. As God hath proſpered
every man; who loveth a chearful giver, and for the orderly diſpenſation of
the ſame, he hath ordained an Office in the Church, to wit, the <hi>Deacons,</hi>
who is to diſpoſe of the ſaid free gift, as every one needeth, Miniſter or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
poor Saint, without reſpect of perſons: now compare Chriſts Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and the Apoſtles practice with the Ordinance of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and
theſe mens practice in theſe times, and you ſhall find a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. And upon examination, you ſhall find that to ſet up or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
another humane invention for Miniſters maintenance, then the Lords
own, who is the only Law-giver to his Church, is to fruſtrate the <hi>Deacons</hi>
Office, and ſo make the word of God of no effect by mens traditions, as
the <hi>Jews</hi> did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 6. 9. and ſo deny Chriſt to be come in the fleſh,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, it becomes not a true reformation, to borrow of a falſe Church,
eſpecially ſuch as Rome, ſo main a Pillar, as Miniſters or maintenance: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
much as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 25. 26 The Lord is againſt <hi>Babilon,</hi> that
deſtroying Mountain, that deſtroyeſt the earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they ſhall not
take of thee a ſtone for a corner, nor a ſtone for a foundation; but thou
ſhalt be utterly deſtroyed for ever, according to the Covenant, root and
branch, compared with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14 to 18.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40773:7"/>
The ſaid practice of taking Tythes, alſo introduceth Prelatical pride, and
time-ſerving with great men in Authority, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 1. all the Miniſters
by that means being lifted up ſo far above their poor Brethren, which cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
unaptneſs to teach, their care being ſet upon the things of this life (as
how to get, ſo alſo to keep the things of this World; whereby he becomes
a brawler, a man of contention, as too ſad experience ſheweth, Courts of
Iuſtice, Committee for Plundered Miniſters, Seſſions, Iuſtices of Peace, by
their trouble and daily vexations, &amp; Sutes, through their covetouſneſs can
witneſs, which cauſeth great covetouſneſs and contention; for the contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which, as the Apoſtle ſaith, is the root of all evil, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10. for
inſtead of being given to hoſpitality, theſe rob the poor that are forc'd to
begg, taking that by force which others get by great labor and toyl. All
which is clear againſt what the Miniſters of Chriſt ought to be, yea, and
muſt be, if they perform their duty, as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. 3. where the Apoſtle
ſaith. A <hi>Biſhop</hi> then muſt be blameleſs, the Husband of one wife, vigilant, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
of good beheaviour, given to hoſpitality, apt to teach, not a brawler,
much leſſe a plunderer for Tythes, not covetous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore if you
will pretend your ſelves Miniſters of Chriſt, prove your ordination by the
word, and be content with your wages.</p>
            <p>This is clear, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 2. where the Apoſtles and Miniſters of the Goſpel
of Chriſt, would not leave the word to ſerve Tables, to wit, to ſupply
the want of the poor Saints, but gave direction for <hi>Deacons</hi> to be choſen
for that ſervice; much leſſe would they look after Tythes, as theſe do by
compulſion and cruelty.</p>
            <p>A Husband-man one day declared at the <hi>Parliament</hi> door, that he rented
300. Acres of Land, and that he proffered the Prieſt 100 thereof gratis, ſo
as that he would manure it; but he would not accept thereof, now judge
ye what a caſe we are fallen into.</p>
            <p>Again, conſider how diſhonourable it is, that ſuch as pretend that they
are put in truſt with the unſearchable treaſure of the Goſpel, ſhould ſo
diſhonour their pretended Maſter, and hinder the receiving thereof by
their forcing maintenance from people, which themſelves confeſs, have
not received the Goſpel from them, nor have they begotten them to the
faith; ſo that they are neither Fathers, Planters, Teachers, Biſhops,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> unto them.</p>
            <p>And yet will they force maintenance from them, contrary to <hi>2 Cor.</hi>

14. 15. Behold the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not
be burthenſome to you; for I ſeek not yours but you; for the Children
ought not to lay up for the Parents, but the Parents for the Children. And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40773:7"/>
I will very gladly ſpend and be ſpent for you, though the more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I love you, the leſſe I be loved.</p>
            <p>But inſtead of this I have ſeen that cruelty exerciſed by the Magiſtrate,
through theſe mens means already, that I never ſaw in four years waiting
at the high Commiſſion Court; But why have we not as well a Doctor of
Phyſick, and a Lawyer forc'd on every Pariſh as theſe, would it be any
more but the like Monopoly? but that we ſhould be forced to pay theſe
men Tythes, not owning them nor their work, they having been the Prieſts
of the Nation, and chief cauſe of all the blood-ſhed, yet now oppreſſing
cruelly ſuch as have adventured life and eſtate for the preſervation of the

<hi>Jaylor</hi> at the high Commiſſion Court, it is ſaid now take him into Cuſtody;
where is demanded 10. times greater charge, Oh <hi>Rehoboams</hi> Reformation,
was ſuch proceedings cruel then, and againſt <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of Right?</hi> and is it not much more in the firſt year of <hi>Englands Jubilee,
Englands Liberty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, conſider the great burthen to the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> for the free
Commones of <hi>England</hi> do hereby in ſome places looſe the profit of one
half of their Land by the year, as may be made appear, if it be duely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered;
to wit, to the Landlord and the Prieſt or Parſon, they only being
Gentlemen, the reſt being ſlaves, and it were well if they were
board through the eares, that they might know themſelves to be ſo,
they being under ſervice and oppreſſion, worſe then the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
in <hi>Egypt</hi> who labour with much ſweat and pains, hunger and cold, wet
and dry: for that which the other like drones or <hi>Caterpillers,</hi> conſume on
their backs and bellies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore our denying the paying of Tythes, is not in the leaſt in any
contempt againſt Civil Authority who are Gods Miniſters not onely to take
vengeance on them that do evil, and ſhould cauſe them to work and eat
their own bread; but for the praiſe of them that do well, and ſhould ſee
ſuch not to eat that will not work; but in obedience to God and the rule
of the Goſpel given forth by his ſpirit to all Nations that believe and obey
him as before is ſhewed.</p>
            <p>2. It is not in contempt to the perſons of theſe men, who pretend they
are Miniſters of Chriſt; But rather deſire they might be imployed in ſome
lawfull way or calling to get their own bread, that ſo he that hath ſtolen (to
wit, Miniſter (or in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Servant) as well as Member) might ſteal no more;
but labour with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have to give
to him that needeth, &amp;c. according to the Apoſtles words <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 28. But
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40773:8"/>
our denying the payment of Tythes, is firſt in obedience to God: all that
do pay them, therein denying Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, by their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
thoſe Jewiſh Rites and Ceremonies which ended in Chriſt; which
theſe ſelf-ſeeking and time-ſerving men, ſtill ſeek to uphold ſo far as they
will make for their own ends, robbing Chriſt of his Prieſthood; poor men
and women of their goods, and without the great mercy of God of their
ſouls, for might they not as well have their Linnen Ephod, or Surplus
Altars, Sacrifices of all ſorts, right ſhoulder and the Maw, Tempel at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
none Inheritance for the Prieſts, yea Circumciſion &amp; killing of Beaſts
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is Tythes, that ſo they that take the wages might do the work injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the wages, as to feed the <hi>Levit,</hi> the ſtranger, fatherleſſe and widow
<hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 29? But if through pride or Lazines they will not do the
work, which they refuſe to do, then let them not wrong the people and
Nation ſo grievous as to take the wages: for to him that worketh is the
wages reckoned of debt, not of grace; But not to him that worketh not, it
muſt be of grace, to wit, of free gift.</p>
            <p>2. Their ordination being falſe and not according to the rule of the
Goſpel; But againſt the Rule, Government and Authority of Chriſt the
Son of God, his Crown &amp; dignity, who is therein the onely King and Law-giver,
whom they ſay is their Maſter, yet do they as the Heathen Tyrants
of old, who clothed men in Beaſts skins, that ſo they might be the more
eagerly devoured: ſo theſe make the true worſhippers of God in Chriſt as
odious as they can by ſlanders and revilings under the name of Hereticks
and Schiſmaticks &amp;c. Never ſhewing wherein, much leſſe proving the thing
true, that ſo they may make the Magiſtrates and common people, as thoſe
deluded by the Friers and Prieſts in <hi>Germany</hi> againſt the <hi>Hugnotes</hi> as they call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, cry out againſt them before they ſee them, Judging them to be
ſtrange Monſters; unhumane Creatures, and ſo do theſe, before they know
them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It being againſt the known declared Laws of the Land, as Statute
<hi>decimo rertio Eliſabeth,</hi> they not upon every induction into any place pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
Reading the Book of Articles and ſubſcribing it, which by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation

God, <hi>&amp;c. 2 Cor.</hi> 10. 4. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 24. 25. 26. The Apoſtle ſaith, The
Servant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle towards all men, apt to
teach, patient in meekneſs, inſtructing the contrary minds, proving if God
at any time will give them repentance. Compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 10. 11. 12.
and <hi>Titus 3. 2. Rom.</hi> 14. 11. where the Apoſtle ſhewes, we ſhall all ſtand

            </p>
            <p>And ſurely the way that Chriſt hath appointed for his Miniſters of the
Goſpel to walk by in all Goſpel-Adminiſtrations, is the ſword of the ſpirit,
the word of God, and not the Authority of the civil Magiſtrate, or ſword
of ſteel, by which <hi>Antichriſt</hi> hath ſo inlarged his Dominions, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.

people of God ſhun this practice, compared with <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 4. where it is
ſaid, Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and
that ye receive not of her plagues.</p>
            <p>It being very conſiderable, whether the civil Magiſtrate giving their
power as to raiſe ſo to the upholding of that ſtate of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> ruling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the bodies and conſciences of the people in Eccleſiaſtical things, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching
upon the prerogative Royal of <hi>King Jeſus,</hi> whereas (he) would
not intermeddle with that which was their due, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 14. whether that
I ſay be not the cauſe why the Lord lets the ſword remain ſo long amongſt
us and other parts, even to the depopulating of the Nations of the earth,
being now even drunk with the blood of the ſlain amongſt us, for many
years paſt, according to <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 6. They have ſhed the blood of Saints

yea, thoſe Nations ſhall be utterly waſted, which I cannot but judge to be
one cauſe of the diſtractions, Warres, ſhedding of blood in the Nations
(of Chriſtians as they pretend) to wit, the civil Magiſtrate intrenching
upon the prerogative Royal of King <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and not permitting him to rule
and raign by his own Laws in his Kingdom, to wit, over the Saints in the
Churches, as before is ſhewed.</p>
            <p>Theſe things conſidered, we could not but in obedience to God, love to
the truth, and eaſe of our own Conſcience, diſcharge our dutie herein to
reminde you of the Proteſtation, Covenant, Declarations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> deſiring to be
eaſed of theſe burthens of popiſh Tythes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That ſo the Land mourn

the Miniſters or Servants of the Goſpel, live upon the Goſpel, even upon
their own hand-labor, or the free and voluntary gift of the people, which
the Goſpel allows them, wherewith they will and ought to be content,
being better to be without a livelihood, then rob and ſteal, and ſin againſt
God, in getting it by unlawful wayes and means. But I doubt not but
all true Miniſters will be content with their true wages alotted for them
by Chriſts appointment, which we are confident will ſufficiently ſatisfie all
ſuch godly ones as deſire and ſeek not the fleece, but the flock; and with
<hi>Paul</hi> ſeek them, not theirs; ſuch as take the word of God for their Guide
and Rule, they having a word for their warrant, not traditions of men of
corrupt minds, and deſtitute of the truth, ſuppoſing gain is godlineſs, or
their own covetous hearts, and mens precepts: it being a meanes to hinder
the free progreſs, and imbracing of the Goſpel-Adminiſtrations: ſo

ſubmitting our perſons with <hi>Daniel</hi> and thoſe worthies, the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

Paſſively to the will and command of the Civil Magiſtrate, as to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

Actively that ſo we may live, although in ſufferings here, yet in Glory
hereafter. For ſuch as ſuffer with him or for him now, ſhall one day raign
Glorified with him, and whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of him and of his
ſayings, to wit, his Ordinances in this adulterous and ſinfull generation of
Tyth-taking Prieſts, of him alſo ſhall the Son of man be aſhamed when he
cometh in the Glory of his Father with his holy Angels, to execute Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without reſpect of perſons; and whether theſe Tyth-takers be not
as truly by the Goſpel Thieves, as ſuch as Rob by the High-way ſide, or
break Houſes, and the upholders by pay or otherwiſe guilty of as great
evils as they that uphold or countenance the other; I leave to every inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
man to Judge; and although it be not ſo well known, by reaſon they
have deluded and bewitched the Nations, yet now God having inlightned
the Earth, he requires an anſwerable obedience thereunto: for where much
is given, much will be required. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 48.</p>
            <p>Thus have we declared our reſolutions to go on in the Lord and the
