         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

APOLOGY
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THAT Man has lived long enough, who has out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived
the Love and Piety he owes to his Native
Country: by my Native Country I do not mean
the fertile and pleaſant Soil of <hi>Britain;</hi> nor the ſweet and
temperate Climate of it; nor the manifold Varieties
which it naturally abounds with for the uſe and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
of humane Life; nor yet the pleaſant and excelling
Rivers which water it; nor the noble Havens, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of most open Ports, from which it ſupplies other
Parts of this our habitable Globe, with the ſuper-abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of thoſe Commodities wherein it excels, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Inhabitants of thoſe Parts ſtand in need; and where
the Waters flow, as well as ebb, as if they invited the
World to trade with us, as well as we with them: But by
my Native Country, I mean the Conſtitutions and Laws
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy, which have continued for near
Nine hundred Years, <hi>viz.</hi> ſince King <hi>Egbert</hi> made a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
that laying aſide the Names of <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
the whole Nation of that part of <hi>Britain</hi> under his
Dominion, ſhould be called <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder theſe Conſtitutions and Laws have all <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Men ever ſince, without any Act of their own Will, been
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60932:3"/>
born in Subjection, and by them have been protected in
their Lives, Liberties and Eſtates; and to govern by
theſe Conſtitutions and Laws, have been the Claims of our
Hereditary Monarchs, who have ever ſince governed
<hi>England;</hi> and though the Succeſſion of the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
have been often changed in the <hi>Saxon, Daniſh</hi> and
<hi>Norman</hi> Race of Kings, yet theſe Laws and Conſtitutions
have been ever ſince preſerved, notwithſtanding the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of many of the Kings of the <hi>Norman,</hi> and I may
ſay of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Race too, to have ſubverted them,
which, I believe, is more than can be ſaid of any other
Monarchy in the World, out of <hi>Britain:</hi> So that in our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, the Conſtitution and Laws of it
are as well the Rules of the King's Dominion, as of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject's
Allegiance to the King; and when the Majeſty of
the King is arrayed in <hi>Judgment, Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi>
then for his Subjects to reſiſt him is <hi>High Treaſon</hi> in this
World, and <hi>Damnation</hi> in that to come: and, I think,
I may truly ſay, no People in the World are more Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of their Kings, yet more jealous of preſerving their
Conſtitutions and Laws than the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> whereby they
have preſerved their Government, now <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi>
whoſe Government was like ours, have loſt theirs.</p>
            <p>But when the Kings of <hi>England</hi> will not make the
Laws and Conſtitutions of <hi>England</hi> to be their Will, but
their Will differing from theſe to be the Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of it; then a divided Dominion will neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follow, and it will be impoſſible for the Subject to obey
both: The King hereby puts himſelf out of God's Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whoſe Vice-Gerent he is in governing by the Laws,
and miſplaces his Majeſty which is founded in the Honour,
Love and Obedience of his Subjects, upon Minions and
Favorites, whoſe Servant he makes himſelf; and theſe
ſhall be the firſt who ſhall forſake him, when any Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſhall come upon him. Our Chronicles give Inſtances here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in the Reigns of King <hi>John, Hen. 3. Edw.</hi> 2. and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60932:3"/>
               <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. And the deſign of this Treatiſe is to ſhew the
Conſequences that have been produced hereby in the Reigns
of the Kings of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Race.</p>
            <p>In this regular Monarchy, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> do
not abrogate old Laws, or impoſe new, or raiſe Monies
from the Subject above the Revenues of the Crown, without
Conſent in Parliament; and hereby the Kings of <hi>England</hi>
reign in the Love and Obedience of their Subjects, and are
freed from the Imputation of Tyranny in Sanguinary
Laws, and from Oppreſſion in the Taxes granted in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
which no abſolute Monarch is; and are more abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
obeyed in both than any abſolute Monarch, who makes
his Will the Law of his Subjects.</p>
            <p>The Diviſion of the Will of a King of <hi>England,</hi> does
not only diſtract the Allegiance of his Subjects, ſo that the
divided Will of the King muſt neceſſarily prevail over the
Laws and Conſtitutions of it, or theſe prevail againſt the
divided Will, for both are incompatible, and cannot ſubſiſt
together: But this Diſtraction gives Life and Motion
to the ambitious Humour of Male-contents, who are impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
as well of Regal Government, as of ſubmitting to the
Laws and Conſtitutions of it. And I ſubmit my ſelf to the
Judgment of any Impartial Reader, if this <hi>Divided Will</hi>
in the Prince did not give that Life and Motion to the
Ambition of the Factions in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> which not only raiſed <hi>Civil Wars</hi> in all of them,
but brought deſtruction upon K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, as well
as the Laws and Conſtitutions of them. However I will
take Notice of the Loyalty of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation both to
K. <hi>James</hi> the firſt, and K. <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, that tho
theſe Kings were foreign born to our Laws and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet it patiently ſubmitted to their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations for
above 35 Years; whereas when King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt
thought he had wholly ſubdued this Kingdom to his Will,
and endeavoured to have done the ſame in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
(his Native Country) the <hi>Scots</hi> would not endure it ſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60932:4"/>
many Weeks as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had done Years, but roſe
againſt it firſt in Tumults, after in open Arms; and
the diſcontented Parties in <hi>England</hi> joining with them,
however disjoined from one another, brought on thoſe
<hi>Civil Wars</hi> in all the Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which procur'd Deſtruction to the King,
as well as the Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>In writing this Hiſtory, I cannot ſay with the noble
<hi>Baptiſta Nani,</hi> I have any Command from my Prince,
or any other to do it; neither will I pretend to ſuch
great Advantages as he had <hi>gratis,</hi> by a free acceſs to
the Records, and moſt ſecret Counſels of my Country;
tho I muſt not ſay, I have been wholly deſtitute of ſome,
for elſe ſuch an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking would render me guilty of
the higheſt Arrogance; but what thoſe have been, I judg
not pertinent here to relate, they will beſt appear by the
Work it ſelf: Yet I can ſay with <hi>Nani,</hi> that I have not
ſuffered my ſelf to be defiled with Partiality (which hath
ſo prevailed in all the Writers of the late and preſent
Times that I have ſeen) but paſſing by the Privilege of
venerable Antiquity, which to a face of Truth hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cloſe adjoining, that of Falſhood, I have choſen to
expoſe my ſelf to Trial, and perhaps to Reproof, and that
I might render a Teſtimony of Authority to Poſterity, to
write the Story of the preſent Age, to the Age it ſelf. And
I am not only induced hereto by the Authority of ſo noble an
Hiſtorian, but by the Reaſon of Hiſtory: For many Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
and Circumſtances, which are no part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of Time, and which ſoon die and are forgotten, are
ſo interwoven in Hiſtory, as to make it entire, and of
one piece, and which not only enliven it, and create plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in reading of it, but without them Hiſtory becomes
disjointed, and is made up of broken pieces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I can, in part, ſay with the noble</hi> Nani, <hi>and in
his own words,</hi> That to compoſe Hiſtories is ſacred,
and not to be undertaken but with an upright
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60932:4"/>
Mind, and undefiled Hands; and for that Cauſe,
the Memory of them was conſigned to the Temple,
under the faithful Cuſtody of the Chief Prieſts, as
the Witneſs or Truſt of thoſe that went before,
and the Treaſure of thoſe that ſhould come after;
not to be handled but as a Religious Thing, and
with great Caution. In ſum, the Hiſtorian taking
to himſelf an abſolute Dictatorſhip, nay an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
more than Human, over Times, Perſons
and Actions, governs Fame, meaſures Deſerts, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates
Intentions, diſcloſes Secrets; is with an
undiſtinguiſhed Arbitriment over Kings and People,
the Judg of Ages paſt, and Maſter of thoſe to
come; Abſolves or Puniſhes, Deceives or Inſtructs.
Whence, not without Reaſon, the Pen of Writers
may be compared to the Lightning, which ſtriking
out but one Letter from the
Name<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Caeſar Auguſtus,</hi> made

makes <hi>Illuſtrious,</hi> and a little
Blot <hi>Infamous;</hi> and the Cenſure of the World there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
is ſo ſevere, that it either conſecrates to
Eternity, or proſcribes to Infamy. For my ſelf I
know not what elſe to wiſh, but that every one
would take upon him to read this Work with the
ſame diſintereſted and innocent Mind with which
I have wrote it, confining my Confidence in this
one thing, that the preſent Age will not be ſo
unjuſt to me, nor ſo ungrateful to Poſterity, as to
deny me the Opinion of Sincerity.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Nani</hi>'s Felicity to write the Stories of the
Times, when the Prudence of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Senate, not
only preſerved their State from the Tumults of War,
wherein <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> was engaged, but in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
was Arbitrator of it: So that the Wars which <hi>Nani</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60932:5"/>
writes of, were like Thunder afar off; yet herein <hi>Nani</hi>
expatiates his Story in a ſhort time, ſcarce 30 Years,
into a large Volume; whereas, without looking after any
thing abroad, but what relates to my Story, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
to the unhappy Story of my Native Country, to ſhew
from what Cauſes ſuch a Train of Conſequences have
followed; that <hi>England,</hi> which before was the Ballance
which turned the Scale of the Affairs of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi>
to that ſide it inclined, not only fell from this envied
Height, and became the moſt deſpiſable of all other States,
but ſunk into the moſt miſerable State of Abject and
Pity.</p>
            <p>I am the rather induced to write the Story of theſe
Times, becauſe the <hi>Hackney-Writers</hi> of them (at leaſt
thoſe I have ſeen) have not only taken things in the
midſt, without aſſigning the Cauſes; but being intereſted
Parties, their Writings have been either fulſom Flatteries,
or Invectives againſt one another, tending to the fixing
of the Diſtempers of the Parties, without regard to the
Publick, or aſſigning the Cauſe of the Diſtempers: But
herein I except the Collections of Mr. <hi>John Ruſhworth,</hi>
who, tho intereſted in the Factions of the late Times,
hath ſo faithfully delivered them over to Poſterity; and
I could have wiſhed, (tho I know not from whence he had it)
that he had not mentioned in that part of King <hi>James</hi>
his Speech to the Parliament 18 <hi>Jac.</hi> that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

when the Offence relates to the Diſhonour of God, the
King, or the publick Deſtruction or Diſtraction of the
Country, where Men are protected in their Lives, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

be in the number of <hi>Lactantius,</hi> who wrote the Relation of

            <p>It was the unhappy Fate of <hi>Europe,</hi> that the Miſeries

            <p>WHEN King <hi>James</hi> became King of <hi>England,</hi> the
Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> was bounded on the North with
the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Sea, from <hi>la Breſle</hi> on the Eaſt, where
this River which parts <hi>Normandy</hi> from <hi>Boloignois</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges
it ſelf into the Sea, and in the Latitude of 50 Deg. North,
and 5 Min. from whence Weſt and by South it extends it ſelf to
<hi>Portſal</hi> in <hi>Bretaign,</hi> about 340 Miles diſtance, and in the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of 48 Degrees; and North and by Eaſt from <hi>la Breſle</hi> to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais,</hi>
which lies in the Latitude of 50 Degrees, 40 Minutes.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Portſal</hi> to the South, inclining into the Eaſt, upon the
Bay of <hi>Biſcay, France</hi> extended it ſelf to St. <hi>Jean de Luz,</hi> which
is the Frontier to <hi>Spain</hi> in the Latitude of 44 Degrees; and from
St. <hi>Jean de Luz,</hi> Eaſt and by South, it extended it ſelf along the
<hi>Pyrenean</hi> Hills to <hi>Perpignian</hi> in the Country of <hi>Roſillion,</hi> in the
Latitude of 42 Deg. 30 Min.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Perpignian</hi> on the South to <hi>Piedmont,</hi> on the Eaſt towards
the North, it was bounded by the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> Sea, and from
<hi>Calais</hi> on the North; the Eaſtern parts of <hi>France</hi> to the South
were bounded by the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands, Lorain, Alſace,</hi> the State
of <hi>Geneva, Savoy</hi> and <hi>Piedmont.</hi> The Continent was near three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
more than <hi>England,</hi> including <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before the Reign of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> in the Year 1474.
<hi>Spain</hi> was divided into ſix Kingdoms, whereof four were Chriſtian,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Kingdoms of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Leons, Arragon, Navarre</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal;</hi>
and two <hi>Mahometan, viz. Granada</hi> and <hi>Murcia.</hi> But when
K. <hi>James</hi> came to be King of <hi>England,</hi> all theſe Kingdoms were
united under <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> King of <hi>Spain. Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi>
having conquered the Kingdoms of <hi>Granada</hi> and <hi>Murcia,</hi> after
<hi>Iſabella</hi>'s death <hi>Ferdinand</hi> conquered <hi>Navarre,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>2d</hi>
claimed and conquered <hi>Portugal</hi> in 1584. after the Death of
<hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> who was overthrown and ſlain by the King of <hi>Fez</hi>
and <hi>Morocco</hi> in 1580. All theſe Kingdoms thus united were greater
than <hi>France</hi> by about ⅓. <hi>Spain</hi> thus united, is a <hi>Peninſula,</hi> having
on the North-Eaſt and South-Eaſt the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Hills; on the
North-Eaſt is <hi>Fontarabia,</hi> and on the South-Eaſt <hi>Cape de Creux;</hi>
the reſt of <hi>Spain</hi> is environed by the Bay of <hi>Biſcay</hi> on the North,
by the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean on the Weſt and South to <hi>Gibralter,</hi> and to
the North-Eaſt by the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea from <hi>Gibralter</hi> to <hi>Cape
de Creux.</hi>

The North of <hi>Spain, viz.</hi> the North of <hi>Biſcay</hi> and <hi>Galicia,</hi> is in
the Latitude of 44 Degrees North; and the South parts of <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luzia</hi>
and <hi>Granada</hi> in the Latitude of 36 Degrees, 30 Minutes:
but the extent of <hi>Spain</hi> about the middle Region of it from Eaſt to
Weſt, is more than from North to South, being near 14 Degrees,
20 Minutes in Longitude.</p>
            <p>The Iſle of <hi>Britain</hi> is the greateſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> it may be of the
World, for ought is certainly known, at leaſt none comparable to
it, except <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> or St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> if it be an
Iſland. The North of it is in the Latitude of 58 Degrees North,
the South-Eaſt in 51 Degrees, and towards the Weſt inclines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Latitude of 50 Degrees. It's bounded on the South by the
Channel, or <hi>Britiſh</hi> Sea; on the Eaſt by the <hi>German</hi> Ocean; on
the North by the <hi>Deucaledonian</hi> Ocean, and on the Weſt by the
<hi>Verguvian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Britain</hi> is divided into two Kingdoms, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,
England</hi> including <hi>Wales,</hi> above ⅓ greater; but incomparably a
better and more fertile Soil, and a more temperate Climate, in a
Northern Climate, lying South of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath ſeveral Iſlands depending upon it
on the North and Weſt; on the North is a Knot of Iſlands, or
Rocks, called <hi>The Orcades,</hi> I cannot tell whether they be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
by Names; but on the North of theſe, in the Latitude
from 60 Degrees to 61 Degrees, lies <hi>Shetland,</hi> or <hi>Shotland,</hi> which
the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltima Thule;</hi> and on the Weſt are the <hi>Hebrides,</hi>
the moſt conſiderable of them are the Iſles of <hi>Mul, Sky,</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>Beſides <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Iſles of our Weſtern Plantations; the
Iſle of <hi>Man,</hi> which lies between <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> the Iſle
of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> which lies between <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> the Iſles of
<hi>Wight, Garnſey</hi> and <hi>Jerſey,</hi> which lie in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Sea between
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> and the <hi>Sorlings,</hi> or Iſles of <hi>Silly,</hi> a Knot
of Iſlands about a Degree Weſt of the Lands-end of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> are
in the Dominion of the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ireland</hi> is a Kingdom and Iſland, depending upon the Kingdom
of <hi>England,</hi> greater than <hi>Scotland,</hi> and near as big as <hi>England,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
<hi>Wales,</hi> and is near of an Oblong Figure, unleſs the Province
of <hi>Munſter</hi> inclines towards the Weſt, near a Degree into the South.
The North of <hi>Ireland</hi> lies in the Latitude of 55 Degrees, 30 Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
North; and the South-Eaſt in the Latitude of 52 Degrees,
30 Minutes; and the South-Weſt in the Latitude of 51 Degrees,
40 Minutes: the breadth from Eaſt to Weſt is near 4 Degrees, 20
Minutes Longitude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ireland,</hi> on the North, is bounded by the <hi>Deucaledonian</hi> Ocean
on the Eaſt by St. <hi>George</hi>'s Channel, on the South by the <hi>Atlantick</hi>
Ocean, and on the Weſt by the <hi>Verguvian</hi> Ocean.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:60932:7"/>
It will much conduce to open the Deſign of the enſuing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
if we look back to the Diſſolution of the <hi>Roman Weſtern</hi>
Empire, and ſee what Kind of Government ſucceeded in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of <hi>Spain, France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and ſo take a view of the
Cauſes of the Ruin of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire: and herein I ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<hi>Helvicus</hi> his <hi>Chriſtian Vulgar Aera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>Britain</hi> was the firſt Country which received the Chriſtian
Faith, ſo <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> the firſt of all the Chriſtian <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Emperors, was born a <hi>Britain,</hi> and became Emperor in the
year of Chriſt 306. A Prince who, as he excelled in Chriſtian Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſo was he adorned with all Moral Vertues requiſite in ſo great
a Prince; and being zealouſly addicted to propagate the Chriſtian
Faith and Religion, he chiefly intended theſe above all other
things; but herein he met with great Oppoſition: nor could he
attain theſe Ends, without ſhaking the Strength and Foundation
of the Conſtitutions of the Empire.</p>
            <p>For in propagating the Chriſtian Faith and Religion, <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
was not only oppoſed by <hi>Diocleſian, Maxentius</hi> and <hi>Maximin,</hi> (who
were Emperours before him) but by his Copartner <hi>Licinius</hi> in
War; and the Chriſtians, if they had been all of one piece, were
not ſufficient to ſupport the Empire againſt the far more numerous
<hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Jews.</hi> Add hereto, that in the Rage of the late Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
under <hi>Diocleſian, Maximinian, Maximin</hi> and <hi>Maxentius,</hi> the
Chriſtians were ſo ſore perſecuted, that excepting their Faith and
Piety for Chriſtianity, they were unfit for any Civil or Military
Imployment; but ſo far were the Chriſtians from being of one
Piece, that they were rent into the Sects and Factions of <hi>Marcioniſts,
Montaniſts, Novatians, Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Sabellians;</hi> and in the <hi>10th</hi>
Year of <hi>Conſtantine, Arius</hi> broacht his blaſphemous Opinion of
our Saviour's not being God from all Eternity, being the Year of
Chriſt 316.</p>
            <p>We do not read that the <hi>Romans,</hi> before the Empire became
Chriſtian, ever made War upon any Nation upon the Account of
Religion; and though there were many Sects among them of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Opinions concerning their Gods, and their Attributes, and of
God's Preſcience, Fate, and the Liberty and Neceſſity of Human
Actions, yet the different Sects never went farther than Brawls,
and endleſs Contentions with one another; they never upon that
Account made any Schiſm or Separation from the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and Service of their Gods preſcribed by the Laws of the
Empire.</p>
            <p>And as among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſo among the <hi>Jews,</hi> tho the Opinions
of the <hi>Phariſees, Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Eſſeans</hi> were as wild and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
as thoſe of the Heathens, yet theſe were never eſteemed by
them to be Acts of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, nor upon that Account did
they diſpenſe or ſeparate themſelves from the publick Worſhip
and Service of God preſcribed by Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60932:8"/>
Whereas the different Sects of the Chriſtians not only baptized
their fond and wicked Opinions, many of which were the ſame
with thoſe of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by the Name of Religion; but took
occaſion from thence to ſeparate and disjoin themſelves from the
Communion, or publick Worſhip and Service of God preſcribed
by publick Authority: So as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had a very difficult Task
to govern the Empire in this diſtracted State, not only of the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> but of the Chriſtians. But ſince Religion is the higheſt
Act of Piety, Devotion and Gratitude, which Man can return to
God for his having preferred Man in his Creation and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
above all other Creatures, in giving him not only Dominion
over them, but much more by enduing Man with an intellectual and
reaſonable Soul, capable of eternal Happineſs; and ſince Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not only miſtaken in the Name and Exerciſe, but made at
this time as much a Stalking-horſe to cover Mens Pride, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical
Opinions, as it was in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time, and ſince, to the
Scandal of Chriſtianity, I hope the Reader will not loſe his
Time in underſtanding the difference between <hi>Chriſtian Faith and
Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and herein what is to be aſcribed to God, and
what is the Duty of Man.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian Faith is a firm Belief and Reliance upon God's Promiſe
revealed in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> to the end that Man by
his Faith, and Obedience to the Precepts which God requires of
him herein, may be made capable of Eternal Happineſs, from which
he was faln by the Diſobedience of our firſt Parents; ſo as Chriſtian
Faith is the Effect of God's meer Grace and Favour to Man,
wherein Man is only paſſive in believing in God thus revealing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ſubmitting to the Precepts which God requires in the
Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian Faith does not abſolve Man from any of the Moral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which God requires of him by the Law of Nature; but
more ſtrictly obliges Man to them, not only in his Speech and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but forbids all Immoral Thoughts and Intentions; ſo that
Chriſtian Faith is ſo far from being incompatiable with humane
Peace and Society in this World, that Man is more obliged hereto
by it, than by the Law of Nature.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian Religion is a conjoining of two or more in honouring
and praiſing God for the publick Bleſſings they enjoy by God's
Favour, both as being by his Grace and Goodneſs received into the
Communion of Chriſt's Congregation, as alſo being protected in
their Lives and Fortunes in their ſeveral Societies and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
So that Chriſtian Religion is the Act of the Will of Man
in conformity to Chriſtian Faith; and Chriſtian Faith and Religion
differ, as Man's Underſtanding and Reaſon: God made Man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Act of Man's Will, an intellectual Creature, to inform all
his future Intentions, Speech and Actions; and it is the Will of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60932:8"/>
Man to intend, ſpeak, and act reaſonably, or conformable to his
Underſtanding. So that tho Chriſtian Faith be the ſame in all
Countries and Places, yet Chriſtian Religion muſt neceſſarily be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in different Countries and Places, as God, in his Providence, is
pleaſed to govern the World in them.</p>
            <p>Thus the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were obliged to join together in
celebrating God's Honour and Praiſes, for his Deliverance of them
out of their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage, and for his immediate Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them, and preſcribing them Laws for the Support of
this Government, and for God's revealing himſelf to them in the
Old Teſtament; which other Nations to whom God had not thus
revealed himſelf, and thus governed, could not do.</p>
            <p>So all Chriſtian Countries and Kingdoms are as well obliged to
join together in honouring and praiſing God for the publick Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
they receive in being protected in every Government in their
Lives and Fortunes in this World, as well as in being received by
God's ſpecial Grace and Favour into the Communion of Chriſt's
Congregation: But God's Providence in governing the World being
after different manners, in divers Places, ſo muſt the Religion,
or the manner of celebrating God's Praiſes, be differing in them.
In <hi>England</hi> we are obliged to honour and praiſe God, that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
God's Bleſſings by Laws peculiar to this Nation, and by being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from the Popiſh Conſpiracy in 1605, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which do not partake with us herein, cannot join herein with
us, nor we with them.</p>
            <p>Religion, or the conjoining of Men in honouring and praiſing
God for the publick Benefits they equally receive from God, is the
higheſt Duty incumbent upon Man: for tho God by a peculiar
Providence foreſees, and provides for all Men in ſeveral manners,
it may be, not for two alike in all the World, and alſo for theſe
in daily Varieties; yet Men are ſecured in theſe particular Bleſſings
by the publick Laws and Governments of the different Places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they inhabit.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian Religion being a conjoining of many in celebrating
God's Praiſes, and in Prayers for God's continuing his Mercies and
Bleſſings; theſe Praiſes and Prayers are ſuppoſed to be uniform and
foreknown, that all who meet, may join with one Voice and Mind
in them: and therefore S. <hi>Paul, 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. exhorts
<hi>Timothy,</hi> that firſt of all, (as for the higheſt Duty of Chriſtians)
Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of Thanks be
<hi>made</hi> for all Men, eſpecially for Kings, and all in Authority under
them <hi>(tho at this time not only the</hi> Roman <hi>Emperours, but all Kings,
and thoſe in Authority were Heathen and Idolaters)</hi> that we may
lead a quiet and peaceable Life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty: for
this is good and acceptable in the Sight of God our Saviour, who
will have all Men to be ſaved, and come to the Knowledg of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60932:9"/>
Truth; for there is one God, and one Mediator between God and
Men, the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> If therefore by Divine Precept or
Command from God, Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions and
Thankſgiving be to be made for Heathen Kings and Magiſtrates,
much more are Chriſtians obliged to make all theſe for Chriſtian
Kings and Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>All Kingdoms conſiſt in the mutual Office of Commanding and
Obeying, ſo that it is as well the Duty of Kings, and thoſe who are
in Authority to command, as it is of the Subjects to obey; and no
Obedience can be, where there is no Command to which it is due;
for where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion, or Omiſſion.</p>
            <p>Tho theſe Offices be diſtinct in their Relations, to the Governors
and Governed, yet the Rules of theſe Offices are the ſame, and
common to both, ſo as that they ought to be foreknown, as well to
thoſe in Authority to command, as thoſe who are ſubject to them;
theſe Rules are the Laws and Conſtitutions of every Kingdom and
Country, which unite them into one Incorporeal, or Intelligible
Body; and under theſe is Mankind in different Places, in divers
manners, maintained in Society and Concord.</p>
            <p>The Offices of Commanding and Obeying, are not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to Moral Speech and Actions, but extend to Religious; for
<hi>the Fear of God is the beginning of Wiſdom,</hi> as well in all publick as
private Actions: So that all Civil Nations to whom God had not
revealed himſelf, however they miſplaced their Deities in <hi>Oſyris,
Iſis, Jupiter,</hi> &amp;c. worſhipped their Gods in publick manner, and
had thoſe Rites and Ceremonies which were performed by ſeparate
Perſons ordained thereto.</p>
            <p>As God governs the World, and all Creatures in it, ſo does he
govern the Kingdoms in the World, and has-ſet fatal Periods to
them, as well as to the Life of Man, and all other Creatures: yet
as he has not in vain given Laws to Man to govern his Intentions,
Speech and Actions by, and made him to ſubſiſt in the Labour of
his Body, and Cares of his Mind, or both; ſo has he not in vain
commanded all Kingdoms and Nations to honour and ſerve him,
and to live juſtly and peaceably with one another: and under theſe
only can Kingdoms and Nations hope for Peace, and God's Bleſſing
upon them.</p>
            <p>So that it is not the extent of the Territories of Kingdoms and
Nations which is the Strength of them, but the number of People
in them: nor is it their well-peopling only, but their Unity in
Religion and Civil Government; for by theſe, ſmall Dominions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
upon others, which are in Diſtraction and Diſſenſion: and
where Kingdoms or Nations become diſtracted or divided, either
in Religion or Civil Government, they become, how great ſoever
they be, ſo much more enfeebled, and tending to outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine
Diſſolution, as theſe ſhall be more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:60932:9"/>
Theſe Diſcords in Religion and Juſtice, have their Beginnings
oft-times from Kings, and thoſe in Authority, and often from the
Subjects. It was <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Wives, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. that turn'd away his
Heart from the Religion which God commanded, which was the
Cauſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. that God rent his Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from him,
and gave it to his Servant <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> and it was <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
which diſtracted the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into Factions, which in time
brought the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity upon them, from which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
returned.</p>
            <p>And as Diſcords in Religion often ariſe from Kings, and thoſe in
Authority, which enfeeble the Strength of Kingdoms and Nations,
ſo does the Oppreſſion, and Injuſtice of Kings, and Magiſtrates,
when they are not God's Miniſters for their Subjects good, make
Kings Inſtruments of their vile Ends to the damage of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
Thus <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to humour his Favourites bred up with him,
preferred them before his Subjects, and threatned to oppreſs them
more than his Father did; whereby he loſt the Dominion of ten
of the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not only from himſelf but from
his Father's Houſe for ever; and became ſo poor and feeble, that
the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> took <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and made Spoil of all the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Riches, which his Father had left him. It was <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs
and Injuſtice in the Murder of <hi>Naboth,</hi> and ſeizing his
Vineyard, that God not only diſinherited his Poſterity, but rooted
them out from the Face of the Earth; 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 21.</p>
            <p>And as this Diſcord in Religion and Juſtice may begin with the
King, and thoſe in Authority, ſo it may from thoſe ſubject to
them. It was the People contrary to God's immediate Command
forſook the Religion and Worſhip which was commanded them,
and ſet up the <hi>Molten Calf</hi> to be adored and worſhipped, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.
and it was the People which twice conſpired to depoſe <hi>Moſes</hi> from
ruling over them, <hi>Numbers</hi> 16. which brought ſo great a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
upon them.</p>
            <p>I do not queſtion, but it was the intolerable Tyranny and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of <hi>Diocleſian, Maximinian, Maximin</hi> and <hi>Maxentius,</hi> as
well as their horrible Perſecution of the Chriſtians, ſo livelily
deſcribed by <hi>Lactantius,</hi> which gave ſo great a Reputation to the
Chriſtians, and made <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Paſſage to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire
more deſirable, not only by the Chriſtians, but even by the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
Nor was the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire at any time of a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
unleſs under <hi>Trajan,</hi> than when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> became ſole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</p>
            <p>Whereas this <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in the Body of it, was never in ſo
diſtracted and feeble a State; for tho <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> in regard of the
Excellency of his natural Diſpoſition, was univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
Emperor, yet above all things endeavouring the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſtian Faith and Religion, and by his own Authority,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60932:10"/>
without the Concurrence of the Senate, he granted an univerſal
Toleration of Religion to all Sects of Chriſtians, as well as <hi>Jews</hi>
and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and not only diſcharged the Chriſtian Clergy, which
by the Conſtitutions of the Empire (when they were not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
perſecuted) were ſubject to give their Attendance upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying
the <hi>Luſtral</hi> Sacrifices, and watch and ward for Security
of the <hi>Pagan Temples;</hi> but made the Chriſtians capable of receiving
Legacies, and of all publick Imployments, ſo as the Chriſtians were
not only in an equal, but better Eſtate than the Gentiles, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all occaſions had the Preference of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Favour.</p>
            <p>But however this diſpleaſed the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> it did not content all
ſorts of Chriſtian Hereticks, and Schiſmaticks, who were ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in their Opinions, that all the Endeavours <hi>Conſtantine</hi> could
uſe, would not reconcile them: For beſides the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council,
he called four more, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Gaul, Ancyra, Neo Caeſarea,</hi> and <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea.</hi>
But when the Hereticks and Schiſmaticks would not ſubmit
to theſe, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> reſtrained them from the Privileges he before
granted them, and left them in the ſame ſtate they were before
he became Emperor, yet not ſubject to further Perſecution.</p>
            <p>This was ſo far from redreſſing the Factions, that they became
more bitter againſt the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Chriſtians than they were before,
and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> countenanced the Hereticks and Schiſmaticks
herein, ſo that in many Places were Tumults and Diſorders; and
many bitter Invectives, even againſt <hi>Conſtantine</hi> himſelf, were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by them. So that the whole Body of the Empire was rent and
torn into Parties and Factions, and <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time wholly taken
up about them, to the neceſſary neglect of the more important
Affairs of the Empire.</p>
            <p>To this ſtate did the deviliſh Pride of theſe Hereticks and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
reduce the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; I ſay deviliſh Pride, for they
were not content to ſubmit, as Chriſt's Servants, to obey him in
thoſe plain and eaſily intelligible Precepts of the Goſpel, but like
<hi>Lucifer</hi> would be wiſe in underſtanding our Saviour's glorious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
which as they are incomprehenſible to Humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
ſo without invading God's Prerogative, which he has not
communicated to any Creature, no Man ought to enquire into
them: and this Miſery attends all the wild and extravagant Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
not only of the Chriſtians, but of all the Sects of other Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
(or rather Sophiſters) about God and his Attributes,
that being founded in their Fantaſtick Brains, they will ſubmit to
no Rule which God requires of Man to determine them, and ſo
they continue in endleſs Contention and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>Theſe Hereticks and Schiſmaticks not content to be Co-partners
with our Saviour in his Attributes, extended their blaſphemous and
extravagant Opinions into the Objects of Religion (which neither
the <hi>Jews</hi> nor <hi>Gentiles</hi> ever did) a Lie in diametrical Contradiction;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60932:10"/>
for Religion is a publick Conjunction of Men in celebrating God's
Praiſes for the publick Bleſſings they alike received from God;
whereas theſe for the Love-ſake Opinion of their own Conceits, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
themſelves from celebrating God's Praiſes for the Benefits
they alike received from God, as Chriſtians: How could the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
Opinions of the <hi>Marcioniſts, Manichees, Novatians, Arians,
Sabellians,</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> abſolve theſe from joining with their
fellow Chriſtians, in giving God Thanks for their Converſion to the
<hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and for their wonderful Deliverance by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi>
from the Rage and Perſecution of <hi>Diocleſian, Maximinian, Maxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
and <hi>Maximin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Gratitude and Piety which theſe Men returned to
God and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> for their Deliverance: and if they made
things thus bad in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Reign, they made them much worſe
after his Death; for notwithſtanding all the pious Endeavours of
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> to the contrary, the <hi>Arians,</hi> above all other Sects, had
over-ſpread the Face of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and his Son <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>

            <p>Nor was the Empire in a much better Condition in the <hi>Weſt,</hi>
for <hi>Arianiſm</hi> had over-ſpread the <hi>Weſtern</hi> as well as the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
and though <hi>Conſtans</hi> were not a Perſecutor of the <hi>Orthodox</hi>
Chriſtians, as his Brother <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was, yet <hi>Liberius,</hi> the Biſhop
(or, if you pleaſe, the Pope) of <hi>Rome,</hi> was an <hi>Arian;</hi> and one
<hi>Felix</hi> became a Competitor with him in his Biſhoprick, or Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
In this Hurly-burly ſtood the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire after the Death
of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> wherein Civil and Military Diſcipline became neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected

Years after the Death of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Julian</hi> (who ſucceeded <hi>Conſtantius)</hi> put the Caſe further than
the <hi>Arians,</hi> for they would allow our Saviour's Divinity to exiſt to
Eternity, though they denied it from Eternity; whereas <hi>Julian</hi>
would not allow him to be a Prophet; and for the ſhort Time of
his Reign, he made it his Buſineſs to reſtore <hi>Paganiſm;</hi> and to
that end revoked all the Powers and Privileges <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had
granted the Chriſtians, and granted a general Indulgence to all
Sects of the Chriſtians, yet recalled all exiled Biſhops, whether
Catholick, or Heretick, ſo that there was a Confuſion among them
in the Execution of their Offices; but in all the countenanced the

            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:60932:11"/>
However <hi>Julian</hi> being a Martial Prince, and the <hi>Perſians</hi> having
in theſe Confuſions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, made Invaſions upon
it; <hi>Julian</hi> raiſed a great Army, and marched againſt <hi>Sapores,</hi> the
King of <hi>Perſia:</hi> but in this Expedition <hi>Julian</hi> died, having reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but one Year, and eight Months, to whom <hi>Jovian</hi> ſucceeded,
who was a zealous <hi>Orthodox</hi> Emperor: but the <hi>Gentiles</hi> under <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
diſliking <hi>Jovian,</hi> and the Chriſtians being in Feuds and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>Jovian</hi> was forced to make an inglorious Peace with <hi>Sapores,</hi>
and delivered up the City of <hi>Niſibis</hi> to him. However <hi>Jovian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Chriſtians to the Privileges and Immunities
which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had granted them, and left the <hi>Pagans</hi> and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
to themſelves: But <hi>Jovian</hi>'s ſhort Reign, being but ſeven
Months and odd days, could perfect no great matter.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Jovian, Valentinian</hi> ſucceeded, who took his Brother <hi>Valens</hi>
to be his Colleague; <hi>Valentinian</hi> was zealouſly <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi>
fierce sa an <hi>Arian: Valentinian</hi> granted a general Indulgence of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to <hi>Pagans,</hi> and all ſorts of Hereticks, but favoured the <hi>Orthodox:</hi>
But <hi>Valens</hi> denied Liberty of Religion, to the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> though
he granted it to all other Sects and Hereticks, and alſo to the
<hi>Pagans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the third Year of the Reign of <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Valens, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi>
made his Son <hi>Gratian</hi> a Co-partner in the Empire; and
having reigned 11 Years died, leaving his Sons <hi>Gratian</hi> and <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian</hi>
Emperors, but <hi>Valens</hi> died three Years after him, <hi>viz. Ann.
378.</hi> and no mention is made of his Iſſue.</p>
            <p>By this time <hi>Arianiſm</hi> had over-ſpread the Face of the Eaſtern
Empire, and was ſo eſtabliſhed that the Orthodox Chriſtians were
forced to exerciſe their Religion in obſcure Conventicles; beſides
the <hi>Viſe,</hi> or <hi>Weſt Goths,</hi> though <hi>Arians,</hi> had over-run <hi>Thrace,</hi> even
to the Gates of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gratian</hi> was Orthodox, and in this diſtracted Eſtate of the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
Empire, was ſore preſſed upon by the <hi>Germans</hi> in the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern;
ſo that he judged his younger Brother <hi>Valentinian</hi> no ways
qualified to reſtrain the warlike Progreſs of the <hi>Goths,</hi> or ſettle the
Eaſtern Empire; and therefore choſe <hi>Theodoſius</hi> for his Colleague.
<hi>Theodoſius</hi> was a <hi>Spaniard</hi> by birth, as well as <hi>Trajan,</hi> a moſt devout
and <hi>Orthodox</hi> Chriſtian, and a moſt valiant and expert Souldier: ſo
that as <hi>Trajan</hi> was the moſt glorious and auguſt of all the Heathen
Emperours, ſo was <hi>Theodoſius</hi> (at leaſt after <hi>Conſtantine)</hi> the moſt
renowned of all the Chriſtian Emperours; yet it was his Fate that
he ſhould ſee his Native Country to be the firſt that fell in the
Ruine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Weſtern Empire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was made Emperor in the Year 379, and forthwith
raiſed an <hi>Imperial</hi> Army, and marched againſt the <hi>Goths,</hi> and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſeveral ſignal Victories over them; and in the Year 380 entred
in Triumph into <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he found it a much more
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60932:11"/>
difficult Task to re-eſtabliſh the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Chriſtians than to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh
the <hi>Goths:</hi> for the <hi>Arians</hi> above 40 Years had been poſſeſſed
of the Revenue belonging to the Church; their Churches rich and
ſplendid, and their Service magnificent; and the <hi>Orthodox</hi> being
poor, and out of Poſſeſſion of any Churches, or Revenue, it was
impoſſible to redreſs theſe in an inſtant, but by degrees; ſo that
it was ten Years before <hi>Theodoſius</hi> could re-eſtabliſh the <hi>Orthodox</hi>
Clergy, and ſuppreſs the <hi>Arian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>viz. Ann.</hi> 381, the next Year after <hi>Theodoſius</hi>
ſettled at <hi>Conſtantinople, Alaricus,</hi> King of the <hi>Weſt Goths,</hi> (who
were <hi>Arians)</hi> marched through <hi>Maeſia,</hi> now called <hi>Hungary, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
and <hi>Gaul,</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> and without any Fighting, or Siege,
that we read of, took Poſſeſſion of the greateſt part of <hi>Spain:</hi> So
much was the antient <hi>Roman</hi> Warlike Diſcipline neglected, while the
Chriſtians were in theſe Feuds and Diſcords among themſelves; ſo
that <hi>Spain</hi> which held the longeſt Wars againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> of all
their Conquered Dominions in <hi>Europe,</hi> was the firſt that was rent
from the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, without a Sword drawn in its Defence.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Spain</hi> was too great to be wholly poſſeſſed by the <hi>Goths,</hi> ſo
that about 40 Years after <hi>Alaricus</hi> had poſſeſſed himſelf of the
other parts of <hi>Spain, Gundericus</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals, Anno</hi> 410,
marched quite through the Body of the <hi>Roman</hi> Weſtern Empire, and
without any interruption, pierced to the moſt remote South-Weſt
part of <hi>Spain,</hi> called <hi>Baetica,</hi> and there planted themſelves, and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> or <hi>Vandaluzia,</hi> or the Country of the <hi>Vandals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been a little more particular in ſetting down the Cauſes of
the Ruin of the <hi>Roman Weſtern</hi> Empire, that the Occaſions of the
like might be avoided in the other parts of Chriſtendom, as well
to avoid the like Conſequences, as the Scandal to Chriſtianity
thereby; and the rather, becauſe that the fond Opinions which
are broached in theſe times, are as extravagant and wild, as thoſe
in the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and after; and Men as obſtinate in
them, and ſo conceited of them, that they make them the Objects
of their Religion; and think themſelves thereby diſcharged from
joining with other Chriſtians, in celebrating Praiſes and Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to God, for the publick Benefits they alike partake.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> truly calls the Brawls among the different Sects of the
<hi>Graecian</hi> Philoſophers, vain Philoſophy; becauſe they tended to no
Edification, or Benefit, but cauſed endleſs Contentions and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords;
and was never more offended than when the Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

            <p>And as the Dogmatizing of theſe Philoſophers (or rather So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters)

For I ſay that by no Rule, or Method of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s
Logick, was ever any Progreſſion of Learning in any one Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in any Art, or Science; if another can ſhew it, it lies on his
part, for I deny it; and I will be particular herein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clavius</hi> in his <hi>Scholium</hi> upon the firſt Propoſition of <hi>Euclid</hi>'s
Elements, endeavours to demonſtrate it by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Logick, in
three <hi>Syllogiſms,</hi> and two <hi>Corollaries,</hi> (ſuch as they are) and then
leaves it not only unconcluſive, but ſays by this way it cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
be done; and therefore not only he, but all other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians,
not only in their Comments upon <hi>Euclid,</hi> but all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mathematical Learning, rejects this way of Reaſoning, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
himſelf to what he had ſaid before in his Demonſtration of it.
As if all Light of Reaſoning were ſo ſhut up in <hi>Claviu;</hi> his Brain,
that becauſe he does not ſee, the reſt of Mankind muſt be blind;
and what is that way of Reaſoning that he betakes himſelf to, but
by hudling the Principles of Geometry into Confuſion, without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or method of Reaſoning, to make a Concluſion, like a <hi>Dutch</hi>
Reckoning of <hi>Altem-al?</hi> From hence it is, that there is no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
or Order of reaſoning obſerv'd in Geometry, whereby this noble
Science is rendred ſo perplext, that of ingenious Men, not one in
twenty can underſtand it, and no Reaſon is given of any one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of our moſt uſeful <hi>Vulgar Arithmetick,</hi> whereby it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
crampt up to ſome few Rules, without further poſſibility of
progreſs.</p>
            <p>And I ſay if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Logick be of no Uſe in Scientifical and
Demonſtrative Learning, then cannot it be in dialectical and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable;
for if any of the Premiſes of a <hi>Syllogiſm</hi> be but probable,
or uncertain, the Concluſion will be leſs probable and more uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
from whence endleſs Confuſion and Diſcord will follow, but
never any rational Knowledg: and from hence it is there are ſo
many Sects among the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> which are derived from <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi>
as Branches from the Trunk of a Tree, as <hi>Clavius</hi> truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
in his Preface of the Nobility and Excellency of Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical

            <p>I would not have carped at <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Clavius</hi> herein, if I did
not underſtand that not only Geometry and Numbers, but all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
Learning, might be taught by one Method of Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
intelligible by Youth in their early Years; and that without
<hi>Algebra,</hi> Square or Cube Roots of ſurd Numbers, might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
without Error; whereby all thoſe ſurd Propoſitions in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks,
which before could only be reſolved <hi>Geometrically,</hi>
may be ſo Numerically; and alſo how in Navigation to find out the
Variation of Longitude in any different Latitude, if an Account

            <p>How much better then were it for the Nobler, and better ſort of
Youth, to be inſtructed in their Mother-Tongues in this Learning,
wherein every Propoſition would beget a new Knowledg, which
may be uſeful to them in their future Converſation and Buſineſs,
than to loſe their whole Youth in learning Greek and Latin, which
they rarely ever after make uſe of, which they might, if that
time had been employed in learning <hi>Welſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh;</hi> and inſtead of
being inſtructed how to deal and converſe juſtly, to be impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the Sophiſtry of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which is of no Uſe to them in
their Converſation and Buſineſs, and excites them into endleſs
Brawls and Contentions not only in civil but religious Affairs?</p>
            <p>Having given an Account of the Reaſons of the Ruine of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Weſtern Empire, and how like our Caſe is to that of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
in its Declenſion; It's time to take a view of the State of the
<hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> after they had planted themſelves in <hi>Spain:</hi> and
herein I obſerve, that though the <hi>Romans</hi> as well as <hi>Grecians,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
all other Nations barbarous but themſelves, yet the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them was equal, if not better than either; for it was a
Regular Monarchy, wherein the King did not govern by an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
deſpotick Power, but by eſtabliſhed Laws; nor could they
make new, nor alter the old, or raiſe Money, without the Conſent
of the States of their Kingdoms, and this continued for many
Hundred Years after: how many of the Kingdoms in <hi>Spain</hi> loſt theſe
Privileges, is too long to be inſerted here; yet at this Day the
Kingdom of <hi>Arragon</hi> retains them: So that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> never
ſpeaks to them as King of <hi>Caſtile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Reign of <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Arcadius Ann.</hi> 408. about five Years
before <hi>Gundericus</hi> entred <hi>Spain, Attila</hi> King of the <hi>Huns</hi> over-run
the Empire, and pierced into <hi>Gaul</hi> with a huge Army, againſt whom
<hi>Honorius</hi> ſent <hi>Ecius,</hi> (the greateſt General of his time) with an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Army, which was raiſed in all parts of the Empire; ſo as
<hi>Ecius</hi> was forced to withdraw the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions in <hi>Britain</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<hi>Attila,</hi> nor did they ever return more; ſo that the poor <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
being enured to no warlike Diſcipline, but only to ſerve their
imperious Maſters, eaſily became a Prey to the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi>
and ſo were in a more ſervile State than when they were under the
<hi>Romans.</hi> To redeem themſelves from which, they called the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Saxons</hi> to their Aſſiſtance, who uſed them worſt of all, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60932:13"/>
expelled the whole Race of them out of that part of <hi>Britain,</hi> now
called <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is obſervable, That as in theſe Times the reſt of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire was over-ſpread with <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> ſo was that part of
<hi>Britain</hi> ſubject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, over-ſpread with <hi>Pelagianiſm;</hi>
and here obſerve the Juſtice of God upon them, that theſe Men
who aſcribed to themſelves a Power of Salvation, without God's
ſpecial Grace and Favour to them, ſhould not be able to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from their Enemies, but be either ſlaughtered by them, or
expelled their Native Country upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Saxons</hi> which conquered the <hi>Britains</hi> were Heathen, yet was
their Government, as well as that of the <hi>Goths,</hi> a Regular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
and ſo continued in all the Dynaſties of their Kings, and
yet is continued notwithſtanding the ſeveral Attempts of many of
the Kings of the <hi>Norman,</hi> and the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Race to the contrary.</p>
            <p>About ten Years after <hi>Ecius</hi> recalled the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions out of
<hi>Britain, viz.</hi> in 418. <hi>Pharamond</hi> entred <hi>Gaul,</hi> and conquered ſome
part of it, which he called <hi>France,</hi> after the Name of the <hi>Franks;</hi>
and <hi>Pharamond</hi> was Heathen; and ſo was <hi>Meroveus</hi> his Succeſſor,
and <hi>Childerick</hi> his Son; and ſo continued till about the Year 490,
when <hi>Clovis</hi> was converted to Chriſtianity: of whom <hi>Meſſeray</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that he was the only King in the World, which was not Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
or Heretick.</p>
            <p>However, the Government of the <hi>Franks,</hi> as well as the <hi>Goths</hi>
and <hi>Saxons,</hi> was a Regular Monarchy, till the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the
<hi>7th,</hi> about the Year 1430. which was above a thouſand Years after
the <hi>Franks</hi> planted themſelves in <hi>Gaul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we look back into the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> we
ſhall find him, it may be, the greateſt of all the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Kings, and
Lord, if not of the greateſt, yet beſt part of <hi>France,</hi> as he was
Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Aquitain</hi> in Right of his Wife <hi>Eleanor, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitain</hi>
having the Ocean on the Weſt, and <hi>Normandy,</hi> the <hi>Britiſh</hi>
Sea on the North.</p>
            <p>But this Dominion did not laſt long, for King <hi>John, Henry</hi>'s Son,
and <hi>John</hi>'s Son <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> endeavouring to uſurp a more than
Legal Authority over their Subjects, cauſed ſuch a Ferment and
Diſcord in the Kingdom; and this laſted near 70 Years, that the
Kings of <hi>France</hi> in the mean time took all <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of <hi>Aquitain</hi> from the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When King <hi>James</hi> became King of <hi>England, Henry</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> was
<hi>French</hi> King, having compoſed by Force and Clemency the Civil
Wars, which had raged near 40 Years all over <hi>France;</hi> and in the
Year 1597, made Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> which was about 5 Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
King <hi>James</hi> became King of <hi>England:</hi> and here let's take a
view of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though <hi>Spain</hi> were 1/3 greater than <hi>France,</hi> when King <hi>James</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:60932:13"/>
came to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> yet <hi>France</hi> was, I believe, fivefold
better peopled, and generally a more fruitful Country: How this
came to paſs it's fit to look back upon the Cauſe of the Sterility
of Men in <hi>Spain,</hi> and their abounding in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> King and Queen of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi>
about the Year 1490, having conquered the Kingdoms of <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
and <hi>Murcia;</hi> and againſt their Faith given to the <hi>Moors,</hi>
brought in the Inquiſition upon them, the greateſt part of the
<hi>Moors</hi> forſook their Country, and thereby left the Kingdoms of
<hi>Granada</hi> and <hi>Murcia,</hi> ſo much leſs peopled: and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
being addicted to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, eſtabliſhed manifold
Biſhopricks and Religious Houſes in theſe Kingdoms of both Sexes;
and the Pope though he pleaſes to make Marriage a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> yet
forbids it to the Clergy, and other of both Sexes who take upon them
a Religious Life; whereby as the <hi>Moors</hi> leaving <hi>Spain,</hi> unpeopled it at
preſent, ſo future Generations became ſo much leſs repleniſhed by
how much more People took upon them a Religious Habit.</p>
            <p>But this Miſchief did not ſtop here, for <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> (great
Grand-Son of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and a moſt bigotted Prince
to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Superſtition) brought the Inquiſition upon the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
Moors,</hi> which drove them out of <hi>Spain</hi> to the farther un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopling
of it; and my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſays, that many of theſe poor
converted <hi>Moors</hi> became as perſecuted in their Exile for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as if they had continued in <hi>Spain:</hi> And this Miſchief fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
followed, not only to <hi>Spain</hi> but to <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> for the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Moors</hi> having no other Habitation and Means of Living, ſet up
their Trade of Piracy in <hi>Algiers, Tunis</hi> and <hi>Tripoli,</hi> within the
<hi>Straits,</hi> and in <hi>Sally</hi> without, whereby they have been a Plague to
all other Chriſtians, as well as <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who trade into the
<hi>Straits</hi> and <hi>Affrick,</hi> and other Southern Countries, ever ſince.</p>
            <p>About the time that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabel</hi> conquered <hi>Spain, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus</hi>
diſcovered the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> and <hi>Hornando Cortez</hi> ſiding with
one part of the <hi>Indians,</hi> which were at War againſt the other, and
thereby becoming Conqueror of thoſe he fought againſt, he got
incredible Wealth, with a Diſcovery of the Rich Mines in <hi>Mexico.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Blaze of this quickly flew all over <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
expected Mountains of Gold in running out of <hi>Spain</hi> into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi>
and therefore near half <hi>Spain</hi> ran into <hi>America,</hi> to ſeek new
Adventures there; the covetous <hi>Spaniard</hi> not conſidering the
Strength and Glory of every Country conſiſts in the well peopling
and governing of it; and that Deſolation is the End of all God's
Judgments upon any Country.</p>
            <p>Here note, that no Art or Science comes to paſs by Fate, Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
or Chance, but by Education, Learning, Converſation and
Experience in Arts; and therefore wherever People are thin, they
are rude, ignorant, poor, heatheniſh, and idle, and of little Uſe to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60932:14"/>
their Country; and alſo where the generality of the People of any
Country, be not imployed in Labours to ſupply other Men, they
become a Burden to the Country to maintain them: ſo that <hi>Spain</hi> in
this ſtate not only loſt their antient Virtue and Military Diſcipline,
but the Inhabitants being more religious and idle People than in
any other part of the World, became hereby not only the feebleſt
of all other Countries, but the pooreſt; and notwithſtanding the
Millions of Treaſure which were yearly imported into <hi>Spain,</hi> yet it
could not ſupport the Luxury of the <hi>Religious,</hi> and maintain the
poor idle Perſons in it.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Spain</hi> could not contain the bloody Superſtitious Rage and
Tyranny of <hi>Philip,</hi> but he endeavoured to have brought in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition</hi>
and <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Government into the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> which
were Provinces more rich and abounding with People, and had more
great and populous Towns, than any other part of the known World
of like Bigneſs, and the Inhabitants of a warlike Conſtitution:
theſe Countries were made free by <hi>Charles, Philip</hi>'s Father, from
their dependance upon <hi>France;</hi> for after <hi>Charles</hi> had taken <hi>Francis</hi>
the firſt, Priſoner, it was one of the Articles for his Enlargement,
that he ſhould remit the Fealty which thoſe Countries paid him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fleming</hi> (for ſo the Inhabitants of theſe Provinces were
generally called from <hi>Flanders</hi> the greateſt of them) did not as the
<hi>Moors,</hi> run out of their Country, but ſtoutly ſtood upon their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
and Privileges, and roſe up in Arms in defence of them:
and theſe Wars continuing above 80 Years, not only put the Kings
of <hi>Spain</hi> to a greater Expence than the Revenues of thoſe Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the Returns of the Plate Fleets from <hi>America</hi> could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;
but after all, above ſeven of theſe Provinces rent themſelves
quite from the Dominion of <hi>Spain,</hi> and erected themſelves into a
<hi>Free-ſtate:</hi> nor till the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> became their Governour,
would the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> truſt the Inhabitants of thoſe which
continued in their Subjection, with Arms to defend themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>French,</hi> whereby the Government of thoſe Countries became
more chargeable to <hi>Spain</hi> than it could ſupport; yet ſo weak,
that they could not reſiſt the Inſults of the <hi>French,</hi> nor the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
Provinces: and in this State <hi>Spain</hi> ſtood when King <hi>James</hi>
became King of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo continued (except the Tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
made in 1609) till the Treaty at <hi>Munſter</hi> in 1648.</p>
            <p>It hath been obſerved in <hi>the Treatiſes</hi> of <hi>the Reaſon of the Decay of
the Strength, Wealth and Trade of</hi> England, and alſo of <hi>the equal Danger
of the Church and State</hi> &amp;c. of <hi>England,</hi> how much the State of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
reſembles that of <hi>Spain;</hi> for if the Excurſion of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>America,</hi> ſo much diſpeoples <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo does the Excurſion of the
Inhabitants of <hi>England</hi> into our <hi>American</hi> Plantations, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopling
<hi>Ireland,</hi> diſpeople <hi>England;</hi> and if the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi>
be a Bar to keep out Supplies in <hi>Spain</hi> for their Expence into <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:60932:14"/>
ſo is the Law againſt naturalizing of Foreigners here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, no Law, or Uſage in <hi>England,</hi> forbids Marriage to any,
for ſupplying future Generations, yet I'le leave it to the Reader to
judg, if, as the Caſe ſtands in <hi>England,</hi> it be not worſe than if
Marriage were forbidden to the ordinary and meaner ſort of <hi>People</hi>
in <hi>England;</hi> for in all the Countries of <hi>England</hi> more poor Children
are born, than can be employed in Rural or Country affairs, and their
poor Parents have not means to bind them Apprentice in Market-Towns
and Corporations, which exclude all other from Trading
with them, but thoſe which have been bound Apprentice, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their Apprenticeſhip: nay the <hi>5th</hi> Act of <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 4. excludes all
from being bound Apprentices, but the Children of Free-men, or
ſuch whoſe Parents had 40 Shill. <hi>per Ann.</hi> and by the Act of <hi>Eliz.
31.</hi> 7. no Cottages ſhall be built in Country Villages, which ſhall
not have 4 Acres of Ground annexed to them, which poor Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
cannot do; ſo that the poor Children not being permitted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
in Country Villages, and excluded out of Market-Towns and
Corporations, are forced either to fly their Country, or to be Tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
Oſtlers and Drawers, Alehouſe-keepers, or Strong-Water-Sellers,
if they can get a Licence: ſo little was the Intereſt of the
Nation underſtood heretofore; for the Strength and Wealth of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Nation is founded in the Number and Induſtry of the Natives;
and therefore to neglect to inſtruct Youth how to employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or to debar any Man from the Benefit of his honeſt Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is not only unjuſt but impolitick.</p>
            <p>And as theſe Corporations in excluding other Men are unjuſt and
impolitick, ſo are they dangerous to the Government otherwiſe, as
they are Marks of Faction and Diſtinction in it; and as they make
themſelves to be the only Free-men in them, whereby they exclude
the reſt of the Nation: Now let's ſee what a Sort of Men theſe are
which claim theſe Prerogatives over the reſt of the Subjects of the
Nation, but generally a Sort of Shop-keepers, Retailers, and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale
Men, who neither labour, nor are otherwiſe of any Uſe to the
Government; but by the Prerogatives of their Freedom, ſet what
Price they pleaſe upon the Labour of poor Artificers, (who are the
Soul of the Nation) and impoſe what Rates they pleaſe to the Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of theſe again of them; whereby their Riches ariſe from the
Oppreſſion of the Labourer, while they are idle, and by impoſing
upon the Nobility, Gentry, and others in ſelling: whereas it's ſaid,
and I believe it, that in <hi>Holland</hi> a Retailer, (or if you will a Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaller)
is not permitted, unleſs to them who are reputed honeſt,
and by Misfortune are fallen into Decay; ſo that as <hi>London</hi> grows
rich by its Freedom of Trade with the Nation, ſo <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and
other Towns in <hi>Holland</hi> grow rich by foreign Trade.</p>
            <p>The Act, 3 <hi>Jac. c.</hi> 6. is of better Authority than any thing I can
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60932:15"/>
ſay, and more livelily deſcribes the manifold Miſchiefs and Abuſes
both to the King and Kingdom, which attended our foreign
Trades by Companies, excluſive to other Subjects of the Nation:
I'le only therefore obſerve this in it, which the Act does not; That
theſe Companies who manage foreign Trades excluſive to other
Men, are more tyrannous and injurious to their fellow Subjects than
any of their Enemies are, as has been ſhewed in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> and
<hi>African</hi> Companies, and hereby have no reaſon to expect any Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
from the Nation to ſupport them, againſt the Inſults of the
<hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> upon them; for why ſhould the Nation aſſiſt them,
who have rent themſelves from the Nation, and are more Enemies
to it than any other?</p>
            <p>But over and above theſe unhappy Accidents, which ſo highly
contributed to the weakning of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, we may add
another, that proved no leſs fatal and deſtructive, and that was
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s deſtroying their invincible <hi>Armada</hi> in the Year
1588. and her ſacking and Burning of <hi>Cales</hi> in 1595. wherein was
deſtroyed ſuch an incredible Maſs of Wealth that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
after were formidable either by Sea or Land; and this was ſo
much the more, by how much <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> proved to be a weak,
effeminate Prince, wholly governed by Favourites.</p>
            <p>Having taken a View of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and compared the
State of them, we'll ſee how they ſtand in reference to <hi>France</hi>
which lies between them, and ſo becomes a neighbouring Nation to
them both: <hi>France</hi> tho it be not threefold greater than <hi>England,</hi>
yet it is manifoldly more peopled in that Proportion, and more
abounding with great, rich, and populous Towns; and tho it be not
an Iſland, yet it has the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Sea on the North, the <hi>Atlantick</hi>
Ocean on the Weſt, and the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea on the South; ſo
that in its Situation, it's better placed for Trade, than if it had been
an Iſland, having <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands, Lorain, Germany,
Savoy</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> to trade to by Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> after he had ſubdued the Popiſh League,
and made a Peace with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> at <hi>Vervins</hi> in 1597, ſecured
the Murmurs of the <hi>Reformed,</hi> by the famous Edict of <hi>Nants;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Prince not leſs prudent in Counſel than victorious in War, as
well to divert the <hi>French</hi> from their mutinous and quarrelling Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
as to increaſe the Riches of <hi>France,</hi> gave all imaginable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to the Inhabitants in Manufactures, the Principles
whereof abound more in <hi>France,</hi> than any other Country, except
<hi>England;</hi> yet added to them the breeding Silk-worms, and by the
lively Ingenuity of the <hi>French,</hi> improved Silk-Manufactures above
any other Country.</p>
            <p>Here take notice of the Benefit which ariſes to any Nation by the
Imployment of People in Manufactures, above other Countries,
where the Inhabitants are not employed: For, ſuppoſe a Million of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60932:15"/>
People in <hi>France</hi> were thus employed, and thoſe yearly earned
20 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> the Employment of theſe People are twenty Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Benefit yearly to <hi>France,</hi> and this Money generally diſtributed
among the Workmen; and whatever of theſe Manufactures are
vended in foreign Trade, theſe will be ſo much an enriching to it;
whereas if theſe had not been employed, they would have been at
leaſt five Millions a Year burden to it, and <hi>France</hi> would have been
in ſo much a worſe State to have ſupported them; whereas if the
People be not employed, as in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Diſtribution of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
out of the <hi>Indies</hi> is not only unequally diſtributed, but the
Charge of maintaining the Religious and idle Perſons, moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and intolerable. Let's now ſee the State of <hi>England,</hi> by the
<hi>5th</hi> Act of <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 4. excluding the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Natives, not Free-men,
from working in Market-Towns and Corporations: we'll take a very
modeſt Eſtimate herein; and ſuppoſe but 10000 yearly (ſcarce one
in a Pariſh) be excluded, ſo that hereby the Nation loſes their
Imployment, this at 20 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> will be 200000 pounds a Year
loſs to the Nation, beſides the Charge of maintaining them, if
they do not fly out of the Kingdom, for want of Subſiſtence in it;
and I pray what does the wholeſale and Retail Trades of Shop-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in them, contribute to the Support of this, or of what Benefit
are they otherwiſe to the Nation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> having thus imployed the Natives of <hi>France,</hi> and
having few Plantations to exhauſt it, tho <hi>France</hi> drove no foreign
Trade by Sea, yet by permitting the <hi>Engliſh, Dutch, Swedes, Danes</hi>
and <hi>Hamburghers</hi> to trade into <hi>France</hi> by Sea, and the <hi>Germans</hi> by
Land, it's ſcarce credible, after the long Civil Wars in <hi>France,</hi> in
the Space of but 13 Years (for it was no longer between the
Peace at <hi>Vervins</hi> in 1597, and his Death) what incredible Treaſure
he amaſſed, if ſo great an Author as <hi>Meſſeray</hi> did not affirm it;
whereupon he nouriſhed a Deſign of new modelling all the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
Parts of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> (except <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which he
knew would not hinder him in it) and <hi>Meſſeray</hi> did not doubt but
he had means enough to have accompliſh'd it, if he had lived; but
when his Foot was in the Stirrup to have accompliſhed this, <hi>Ravil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac</hi>
put a full Stop to his Career.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>France</hi> had in it no Mines of Gold or Silver, no more than
<hi>England</hi> hath; and the Treaſure which <hi>England</hi> acquires, is by the

leſs in foreign Trade, by reſtraining the Vent to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, and
more to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Companies, ſo much leſs Treaſure will the Nation
acquire, and the Natives be leſs employed.</p>
            <p>As <hi>France</hi> thus abounds in People more than either <hi>England</hi> or
<hi>Spain,</hi> whereby they acquire ſuch vaſt Wealth above them, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting

and if this had not uſually excited them into inteſtine Broils and
Tumults, as Secretary <hi>Trevor</hi> obſerves, all their Neighbour Nations
could not have ſet bounds to their ambitious Humour.</p>
            <p>But the Proſperity of <hi>France</hi> no ways daunted Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
ſo that <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> deſigning to build ſome great Men of War at
<hi>Breſt,</hi> ſhe forbid the King's making any further Progreſs in it, or ſhe
would fire all the Ships in his Harbours, whereupon this great Hero
deſiſted; nor would ſhe permit the <hi>Dutch</hi> to build any great Ships,
but ſhe would have an account of them; and ſo having the <hi>Brill,
Ramakins</hi> and <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> the Keys of the Rivers of the <hi>Maes</hi> and
<hi>Scheld,</hi> in her Hands, ſhe died with an uncontrouled Dominion of
the Seas, and Arbitreſs of <hi>Chriſtendom:</hi> and in this State King <hi>James</hi>
took Poſſeſſion of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> with all its Dependences,
to which he added that of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe Reign is now ripe to be

                  <p>A Better View may appear of this Reign, if we look back
to the Beginning of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
and compare it with that of this King's Reign, when
he came to join the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to
that of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and thereby became the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
that governed <hi>England</hi> ſince King <hi>John,</hi> except it was in the
Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, and ſome time of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the
Sixth, when <hi>Normandy,</hi> and ſo great a part of <hi>France,</hi> was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
to the Dominion of the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Kingdom was never in ſo low an Ebb of Reputation, and
ſo dangerous a State both at home and abroad, as when Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to the Crown, her Father, Brother and Siſter in
debt, and the Navy Royal neglected and out of Repair; yet the
Revenues of the Crown, beſides the Court of Wards and the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60932:17"/>
Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> I ſay, the Profits of the Kingdom were but
188179 <hi>l. 4 s. [See Sir</hi> Robert Cotton'<hi>s Means of the Kings of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>p. 3.]</hi> the Kingdom imbroiled in inteſtine Heats in Religion,
and <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond of <hi>Spain</hi> aſpiring to an unlimited Dominion in
and out of <hi>Europe; Calais,</hi> notwithſtanding the united Intereſt of
<hi>England</hi> with <hi>Spain,</hi> but ſome Months before loſt to the <hi>French;</hi>
and <hi>Francis</hi> the Dauphin of <hi>France,</hi> in right of his Wife <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> laying claim to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas when King <hi>James</hi> came to be King of <hi>England,</hi> the
Kingdom was in intire Peace within, and in a Martial State, and
full of Honour and Reputation abroad; the Royal Navy not only
Superior to any other in the World in Strength, but in good
Repair; few Debts left charged upon the Crown: yet if the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer
were not repleniſhed with Money, the King received Three
entire Subſidies, and ſix fifteens of the 4 Subſidies, and eight
Fifteens granted to the Queen for ſuppreſſing the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion,
and carrying on the War againſt <hi>Spain</hi> ſome Months before, though
both the Rebellion, and War with <hi>Spain</hi> ceaſed that Year he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
King; the Cuſtoms for ſupporting the Navy, more than
fivefold they were in the Beginning of the Reign of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and above two Millions and four hundred Thouſand
Pounds due from the States of <hi>Holland</hi> (or the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Netherlands;)</hi>
but how the States became diſcharged of it, it's fit to premiſe it
there, and how it became due to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ſo to the
Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> though ſhe refuſed to accept of the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> when ſhe took them into Protection,
after the Expulſion of the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and the Death of the
Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> yet ſhe entred into a Treaty with the States,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1585. wherein it was agreed, That the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould repay her
all the Monies which ſhe ſhould expend for their Preſervation, with
Intereſt at 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> when the War was ended with <hi>Spain;</hi> and that
two <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whom the Queen ſhould name, ſhould be admitted into
their Council of State, and for Security whereof the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould
deliver up to her <hi>Fluſhing, Rammekins,</hi> and the <hi>Brill,</hi> which were the
Keys of their Country.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Agreement the Queen, for the <hi>Dutch</hi>'s further En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
gave them Licence to fiſh upon the Coaſt of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which ſhe denied them when they continued in their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to King <hi>Philip;</hi> and removed the Staple of the <hi>Engliſh Woollen
Manufactures</hi> from <hi>Antwerp,</hi> in the Power of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
to <hi>Delf,</hi> in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Power; and it is ſcarce credible, how in ſo
ſhort a time after, <hi>viz.</hi> ſcarce thirteen Years, the <hi>Dutch</hi> entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all ſorts of People, who were perſecuted upon the Account of
not ſubmitting to the Papal Uſurpations, (called Religion) ſwelled
their Trade and Navigation, not only in <hi>Europe</hi> but in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and

                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:60932:17"/>
The Queen conſidering this Encreaſe of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade and
Navigation was as much to the leſſening of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and being
provoked by the Ingratitude of the <hi>Loveſtein</hi> Faction, whereof one
<hi>Olden Barnevelt</hi> was the Head (a Fellow as factious and turbulent,
as ungrateful) by whoſe Counſel another Aſſembly was erected at
<hi>Amſterdam,</hi> called <hi>The Convention of the States General,</hi> wherein
they managed all the ſecret and important Affairs of their State, and
out of which they excluded the <hi>Engliſh:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Queen, I ſay, highly incenſed at the Ingratitude of this Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which now governed all in <hi>Holland,</hi> and yet continuing to
ſupport them at the Charge of 120000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> as <hi>Camden</hi>
obſerves in his <hi>Eliz. Reg. Ann.</hi> 1598, ſignified to the States her
Intention of making Peace with the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> which if ſhe
did, it would be impoſſible for them to continue their War with
<hi>Spain,</hi> and recover their Cautionary-Towns from the Queen.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the States ſent my Lord <hi>Warmond</hi> (as they called
him) as their humble Supplicant to the Queen, and in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Poſture of Humility acknowledged themſelves obliged to her
for infinite Benefits; and that as her Majeſty excelled the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of her Anceſtors in Power, ſo ſhe excelled them in Acts of
Piety and Mercy, but pleaded Poverty for not repayment of
the Money the Queen had expended for their Preſervation, (they
might have ſaid their Exaltation.) The Queen in Anſwer to them
ſaid, ſhe had been often deceived by their deceitful Supplications,
and ungrateful Actions, and Pretence of Poverty, when their Power
and Riches confuted them; and that ſhe hoped God would not ſuffer
her to be a Pattern to other Princes to help ſuch a People, who bear
no Reverence to Superiors, nor take care for the Advantage, Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
or Safety of any but themſelves. The <hi>Dutch</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
at the Queen's Anſwer, ſubmitted themſelves to ſuch Terms
as the Queen ſhould lay upon them; and the Queen wiſely conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
if ſhe ſhould caſt them off, <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who the
laſt Year, <hi>viz.</hi> 1597, had concluded a Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Vervins,</hi>
by the Interpoſition of the Pope's Nuncio, and ſought to be
Protector of the States, whereby the Queen would not only be in
danger to loſe their Dependance, but the Monies ſhe had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
in their Support, they (the Queen and States) came to
this Agreeement.</p>
                  <p>1. That upon an Account ſtated, there was eight Millions of Crowns, or
two Millions Sterling due to the Queen, for which they were to pay
Ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> ſo long as the War laſted.</p>
                  <p>2. That during the War they ſhould pay the Queen one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds yearly, and the Remainder when Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> was
concluded, and then to have their Cautionary Towns ſurrendred back
to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:60932:18"/>
3. That till this Agreement was performed, the States were to pay
Fifteen hundred <hi>Engliſh</hi> in Gariſon in them. <hi>We leave this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
here till we hear more of it hereafter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There were but thirteen Months between this King's Birth and
Reign, his Mother being depoſed to make Room for his coming to
be King; and by this Title he reigned twenty Years in his Mother's
Life, and during that time he never made uſe of her Name in the
Coin of <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor in any Proclamation or Law, and after her
Death, continued his Reign by this Title to his dying Day:
which was inconſiſtent with the Flatteries which his Favourites
buz'd continually in his Ears, That he was King by inherent Birth-right,
and that he held his Crown from God alone: and ſo pleaſing
was this Doctrine to him, that above all other things he ſet himſelf
upon it, not only in magnifying himſelf herein, in his Speeches in
Parliament, but in his Writings againſt <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Peron</hi> againſt
the Pope's depoſing Kings.</p>
                  <p>In his Infancy and Minority the Regents and Nobility made Havock
of the Crown and Church Revenues, ſo as when he came to Age,
he had but little left to ſupport his Crown and Dignity; but by how
much he became leſſened hereby, the Nobility became ſo much
greater, and to ſupport themſelves, held a Correſpondence with
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who tho ſhe countenanced the Nobility, yet ſhe
allowed the King a yearly Penſion of 4000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> (I have heard
and believe it) in his Minority, and 10000 <hi>l. per An.</hi> after he came to
age, and hereby kept both the King and Nobility depending on her.</p>
                  <p>As the Nobility, in his Minority, made him ſo poor, ſo the Kirk-party
juſtled him in his Throne, by making themſelves a diſtinct
Table from the Secular or Temporal Power, not only in Matters
purely Spiritual, but in holding General Aſſemblies and all Matters
which related to what they pleaſed to call <hi>The Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi>
and were ſo zealous, I will not ſay <hi>Rude,</hi> herein, that they made it
a Duty incumbent upon the Temporal Power, to paſs the Acts of
their General Aſſemblies into Laws: And, in truth, they expreſſed
but little Civility to the King, in whatſoever they applied themſelves
to him, as if it were his Duty to do whatſoever they would have him,
and without his Conſent; and even to croſs him, would ordain Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-days,
and ſometimes upon Sundays: And hating Epiſcopal
Government, it was very troubleſome to the Regents, in his Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as well as to the King, to retain the Name of a Biſhop, after
they aſſumed to themſelves the Power. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was no
better Friend to this Kirk-party than the King, though ſhe winkt
at it, and was the more provoked againſt it, by <hi>Knocks</hi> his Book
which he wrote againſt <hi>Gynarchy;</hi> and from hence it was King
<hi>James</hi> took the eaſier Impreſſion of Flatterers, and was ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
a Defender of Biſhops, that in a Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:60932:18"/>
in the firſt Year of his Reign, he held it for a Maxim, <hi>No
Biſhop, no King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Tears which all true <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhed for the Death of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who died the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1602. were ſoon wiped
off, by the Acceſſion of King <hi>James</hi> to this Crown, the antient
Feuds between the Nations of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> were reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
and <hi>John Stow</hi> in his Annals of the firſt of this King, gives a
particular Account of his moſt magnificent and joyful Reception
day by day from <hi>Berwick</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> yet with this Blot in his Scut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon,
that when he came to <hi>Newark,</hi> he firſt diſcovered his Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to Arbitrary Government; for being told that one had cut
a Purſe at <hi>Newark,</hi> the King without any Legal Proceſs, or the
Defence of the Party, ſigned a Warrant to the Sheriff of <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>
to hang him, which was executed accordingly.</p>
                  <p>This put no Check to the Jollity of the People, but the nearer
he came to <hi>London,</hi> the greater was the Concourſe and Acclamations
of the People, tho by his Proclamation, (of which never any
Prince was ſo prodigal, and wherein he continued to his dying
Day) he had forbid it, becauſe it raiſed ſo much Duſt as proved
troubleſome in his Paſſage; and upon the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> he came to
<hi>London,</hi> where, being a Prince above all others addicted to Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as his firſt care, upon the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> iſſued out another
Proclamation forbidding all manner of Perſons killing Deer, and
all kinds of Wild-fowl uſed for Hunting and Hawking, upon Pain
of the ſeveral Laws and Penalties to be executed upon them.</p>
                  <p>The gazing World abroad, were aſtoniſhed at this King's peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and joyful Settlement in <hi>England,</hi> and were as forward to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
him in it, as his Subjects were to receive him; and herein
the <hi>Dutch</hi> (being Merchants) were the firſt that addreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to make their Market of him, and ſent over the youngeſt
Son of <hi>William,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> one <hi>Fulk,</hi> and <hi>Barnevelt,</hi> who,
(in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> lay covered in his Faction at
<hi>Amſterdam,</hi> as Tortoiſes do under Ground in the Winter) now the
<hi>Dutch</hi> deſigning to make their Harveſt in this King's Reign, came
abroad, as Tortoiſes do in the Spring, to diſpoſe him to it: but
the <hi>Dutch</hi> needed not have been ſo forward herein, for the King
was environed with thoſe which ſhould do their Work, better than
<hi>Barnevelt</hi> could have done it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> after the Loſs of their Armada in 1588, and
the Loſs ſuſtained in the Sacking of <hi>Cadiz</hi> in 1595, declined as
faſt in Power and Reputation, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> grew greater both in
<hi>Europe,</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> But <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> dying about three
Years before Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the former Feuds between her and
<hi>Philip</hi> became much abated, and <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> ſucceeding, a young
Prince <hi>(Nani</hi> ſays) of ſingular Piety (he means devoted to the <hi>Rom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi>
Superſtition) but wholly unacquainted with Government, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60932:19"/>
contenting himſelf with the Royal Dignity, left the Power to his
Favourites and Miniſters, and of whom <hi>Nani</hi> in his fourth Book,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1621, makes this notable Remark as to his Death; That it
remained a Doubt, whether in an Age proclaimed by the Wrath
of Heaven to the Mockery of Favourites, the King would not
have taken upon himſelf the Government, when Death, in the <hi>43d.</hi>
Year of his Age takes him away from the Troubles which Empire
carries with it? His Years ſurely would have been more memorable,
if he had been born a private Man rather than a King; becauſe
being better adorned with Ornaments of Life, than endowed with
Skill to command, as Goodneſs, Piety and Continence, placed him
in an higher degree than ordinary Subjects; ſo his Diſapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Government, rendred him lower than was fit or neceſſary.
By publick Defects private Vertues being corrupted, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
keeping his Mind in Idleneſs, it was believed that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
nothing to himſelf to do, but to conſent to all that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
had a mind to.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Government of the World recommended to Princes, as
the true Shepherds, falls into Mercenary Hands, making themſelves
not underſtood but by the ſound of the Voice of Intereſt, and the
Authority of Ambitition, the People ſuffer Ruin and Calamity, and
the Princes themſelves render an Account to God of that Talent
which they have ſuffered their Miniſters to make Merchandiſe of.
It is certain, <hi>Philip</hi> in the Agony of his Death, was not ſo much
comforted with calling to mind his innocent Life, as he was troubled
with the Sting of Conſcience for his Omiſſions in Government.</p>
                  <p>This Character, how parallel ſoever it was with King <hi>Charles</hi>
the Firſt, tho I do not find he had any Sting of Conſcience for
his Omiſſions and Tranſgreſſions in Government, which brought
upon himſelf and the Nation all the Miſeries and Calamities of the
late Civil Wars, and wherein he perſiſted to the laſt, bears no
Proportion to the voluptuous and diſſolute Life of King <hi>James,</hi>
accompanied with his profane Swearing in Paſſion, and even in his
uſual Converſation, whereby he became not only contemptible,
but by his Example, the generality of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation became
debauch'd in their Manners and Converſation, to the Scandal and
Contempt of it in other Nations.</p>
                  <p>The Death of <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> made the Paſſage to a Peace between
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> whereto both Kings were equally diſpoſed,
more ſmooth and eaſy. Yet <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> before he would open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeek it, by an Ambaſſador from the Arch-Duke <hi>Albert,</hi> (Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of <hi>Flanders)</hi> felt the Pulſe of the Court, how it ſtood
affected to a Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> which beat high towards it, ſo as
ſoon after it followed; which as it was moſt beneficial to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, ſo it had been to <hi>Spain,</hi> if it had been as ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerved by King <hi>James,</hi> as it was by <hi>Philip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:60932:19"/>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> tho ſpited, as 'twas ſaid, that King
<hi>James</hi> ſhould not only come ſo peaceably, but with univerſal
Acclamations to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> whereas he laboured
with ſuch difficulty above ſeven Years to attain that of <hi>France,</hi>
and at laſt was forced to a diſhonourable Submiſſion to the Pope,
<hi>Clement</hi> VIII. Yet being a Prince of great Prudence in Peace, as
well as fortunate and victorious in War, ſent Monſieur <hi>de Roſny,</hi>
Great Treaſurer of <hi>France,</hi> to renew the Treaty of Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
formerly made between Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and him, which
was without any difficulty done.</p>
                  <p>The King being thus at Peace Abroad and at Home, not only
in <hi>England</hi> but in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as if the Wars expired there with
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he not only pardoned the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> the
Head of that Rebellion, but by Proclamation declar'd he was
reſtor'd to the King's Favour, and to be honourably uſed of all
Men.</p>
                  <p>But how pleaſing ſoever the King's coming to the Crown of
<hi>England</hi> was to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, it ſeems it was not ſo, or
ſomething elſe, to God; for an horrible Plague, greater than any
ſince that in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> accompanied his coming
in. There were two Factions in <hi>England</hi> when the King came to
the Crown, diſtinguiſhed by the Names of <hi>Puritans and Papiſts,</hi>
both diſſenting from the Religion eſtabliſhed in the Church of
<hi>England:</hi> the King hated thoſe, and wrote againſt theſe, chiefly
for their Doctrine of the Pope's Power of depoſing Kings: Theſe
received the King after different manners, the <hi>Puritans</hi> had a huge
Expectation of his Favour, becauſe he was bred up in their
Doctrine and Diſcipline; but were much deceived in it, for he
rarely mentioned them but with Deteſtation, which he did not
thoſe of the Popiſh Religion.</p>
                  <p>However in <hi>January</hi> they obtained a Conference with the
Church-Party at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> where the King himſelf would
be Moderator, whilſt moſt of the Nobility and Biſhops were
Spectators. You need not doubt which Party prevail'd, the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Biſhops not only giving the King the Victory, with the
Epithets of, <hi>The</hi> Solomon <hi>of the Age, The moſt Learned,</hi> but of
<hi>being inſpired.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what Expectation ſoever the <hi>Puritans</hi> had of the King's
coming to the Crown, the Papiſts had another Leſſon taught them;
for tho the Popiſh Conſpiracy againſt the Perſon of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
ceaſed upon the Death of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> yet did not
the Pope's Deſigns upon the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> do ſo; but
<hi>Clement</hi> VIII, in the Year 1600, ſent Orders to his Emiſſaries in
<hi>England,</hi> that the Catholicks ſhould admit none to ſucceed the

<hi>Watſon</hi> and <hi>Clark,</hi> two <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts, joined in <hi>Cobhant</hi>'s
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60932:20"/>
Conſpiracy, to have kept the King from coming to the Crown, and
were executed for it as Traitors; but the Effects of the Pope's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
did not die with <hi>Clark</hi> and <hi>Watſon,</hi> as you'll ſoon hear,
and upon the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1603, a Proclamation was made for
Quietneſs to be obſerved in Matters of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the Rage of the Peſtilence, the firſt nine
Months after the King's coming to <hi>London,</hi> all were Halcion-days,
Proclamations, Pageants, Feaſtings, Creation of Lords and
Knights, Reception of Foreign Ambaſſadors, erecting a Maſter of
the Ceremonies after the Mode of <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c. and in this time
the Dignified Clergy, and thoſe who courted to be ſo with the
Favourites at Court, with whom the <hi>Civilians</hi> chimed in, had ſo
rooted their Doctrine of the King's Abſolute Power, and that,
notwithſtanding his Succeſſion to the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the
Life of his Mother, he ſucceeded by inherent Birth-right; and that
Primogeniture is the Gift of God by the Law of Nature; and
that in his Perſon was reconciled all the Titles of our <hi>Saxon, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
and <hi>Norman</hi> Race of Kings; that being propenſly diſpoſed to
receive the Impreſſions, they took ſuch deep root in him, that in
all his Life after he would never, with Patience, hear any thing to
the contrary, however it was not long before he heard of it, as
you ſhall hear. But we will ſtay a little, and ſee how inconſiſtent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
theſe Flatterers jumbled an Abſolute and Hereditary Monarchy
together, and how this King reconciled the Titles of the <hi>Saxon,
Daniſh</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Titles to the Crown.</p>
                  <p>For no Hereditary Monarch that ever reigned in this World,
but derived his Title from an Anceſtor who had no Hereditary
Right; nor did ever any Hereditary King ſucceed, but to govern
by Laws and Conſtitutions, which were eſtabliſhed before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
King: So however Abſolute may be applicable to Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
yet it is inconſiſtent with Hereditary Kings, eſpecially in a
Regular Monarchy, as that of <hi>England</hi> is, and thoſe of old, as of
the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> where the Will of the King alone could
not alter the Laws and Conſtitutions of them. And now let us
ſee how King <hi>James</hi> came to claim his Crown by inherent Birth-right,
and how all the <hi>Saxon, Daniſh</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Titles came to be
reconciled in his Perſon.</p>
                  <p>It's evident to me, that tho only God can make an Heir, and
that tho Primogeniture be natural; yet God, in diſpoſing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
is not obliged to it; (tho <hi>Grotius lib. 1. Tit. 11. de Jure
Belli &amp; Pacis,</hi> is pleaſed to ſay, the Law of Nature is immutable
by God himſelf) but reſerves unto himſelf the Prerogative of
diſpoſing Kingdoms, without reſtraining the Succeſſion of the King
to Primogeniture, or Hereditary Succeſſion. Here let us ſee in
Epitome, which you may read at large in Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> his
Hiſtory of the Succeſſion of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> (before and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60932:20"/>
after the Conqueſt, and the Hiſtory of the Succeſſion of the Crown
of <hi>England,</hi> from King <hi>Egbert</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> printed in the
Year 1690,) where you will ſee, that tho the Kings of <hi>England,</hi>
both before and after the Conqueſt, ſucceeded in their Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
yet many more were not in the right Line than in it; and
tho before <hi>Caeſar</hi> invaded <hi>Britain,</hi> there was no other Government
but Kingly, yet <hi>Britain</hi> was divided into ſo many petty Kingdoms,
that tho it had not been barbarous, it would have been as difficult
to have wrote the Hiſtory of the Succeſſion of their Kings, as to
have wrote the Hiſtory of the Succeſſion of the Kings immediately
after the Flood.</p>
                  <p>After the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire (oppreſſed by its own Weight, by the
Diviſion into Eaſtern and Weſtern, its inteſtine Jars, and the
over-flowing of barbarous Nations) was ſo torn and ſhaken, that
the Legions which governed <hi>Britain,</hi> were recalled by <hi>Ecius</hi> (the
<hi>Roman</hi> General, under <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Valentinian</hi> the <hi>3d)</hi> to make
Head againſt <hi>Attila;</hi> the poor <hi>Britains</hi> diſarmed, and only made
uſe of to ſerve their imperious Maſters, and ſo utterly deſtitute
of Martial Diſcipline, eaſily became a Prey to the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi>
(not ſubject to the <hi>Romans)</hi> who treated them more intolerably
and tyrannically than the <hi>Romans</hi> had done: For Redreſs whereof,
the <hi>Britains</hi> ſought Succours from the <hi>Engliſh Saxons,</hi> who came
to their Relief in the Year 409, (as <hi>Bede</hi> ſays, <hi>lib. 1. cap.</hi> 15.
of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nation;)</hi> but theſe
<hi>Saxons</hi> uſed the poor <hi>Britains</hi> worſt of all, and expelled the whole
Race of them out of that part of the Iſland now called <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho the <hi>Saxons</hi> had their Wills of the <hi>Britains,</hi> they were
before the <hi>Heptarchy</hi> at continual Variance among themſelves,
and ſo after, that it is almoſt as unaccountable to give a Hiſtory
of the Succeſſion of their Kings, as it was of the <hi>Britains</hi> before
<hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi>

                     <hi>Egbert,</hi> about the Year 800, (<hi>viz.</hi> 391 Years after the <hi>Saxon</hi>
Invaſion) was called the firſt of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Monarchs; (tho the
Kingdom of the <hi>Mercians</hi> was not united to his Monarchy) who
by Merit as well as Birth, obtained the Dignity, and ſucceeded
<hi>Brithric.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ethelwolph</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Egbert</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Weſtſax,</hi> but

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ethelwolph</hi> by his Will divided his Kingdoms between his two

Kingdom of the <hi>Weſt Saxons,</hi> to <hi>Ethelbert</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Kent,</hi>

Ethelred</hi> ſucceeded in the whole, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Weſt Saxons,</hi> and of

                     <hi>Alfred,</hi> after the Death of <hi>Ethelred,</hi> by univerſal Applauſe, the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Edward</hi> Son of <hi>Alfred,</hi> was choſen by the Nobles, on <hi>Whit-ſunday,</hi>
in 901.</p>

by the Nobles, of whom 'twas ſaid there was nothing ignoble
in him.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Athelſtan</hi> dying without Iſſue, his younger Brother <hi>Edmund</hi>
ſucceeded him without any Oppoſition; and tho he left two Sons,
<hi>Edwy</hi> and <hi>Edgar,</hi> yet</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edred (Edmund</hi>'s younger Brother) ſucceeded him.</p>

                     <hi>Edwy,</hi> after <hi>Edred</hi>'s Death <hi>(Edred</hi>'s elder Brother's elder Son)
ſucceeded; but being a vicious Prince, the <hi>Mercians</hi> and <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brians</hi>
choſe <hi>Edgar</hi> his younger Brother King in the Life of <hi>Edwy;</hi>
and</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edgar,</hi> after the Death of <hi>Edwy,</hi> became King of the whole

                  <p>

being murdered by his Step-mother <hi>Elfreil, Edward</hi>'s younger

tho he had two half-legitimate younger Brothers, <hi>Edward</hi>
and <hi>Alfred,</hi> born of <hi>Emma, Etheldred</hi>'s Wife) was choſen King
by one part of the Nobility, and <hi>Canutus</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> by another.
Thus the whole legitimate Race of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings were excluded;
one part chuſing <hi>Ironſide,</hi> a Baſtard, the other <hi>Canutus,</hi> a Stranger
to the <hi>Saxon</hi> Royal Race.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edmund Ironſide</hi> being treacherouſly murdered by his Brother-in-law

                  <p>
                     <hi>Canutus</hi> the <hi>Dane</hi> became ſole Monarch of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy:
So that this was the beginning of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Dynaſty, which

                  <p>
                     <hi>Harold,</hi> Son of <hi>Canutus,</hi> ſucceeded him; and</p>

ended the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Rule, with the Slaughter and Expulſion of
the <hi>Danes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edward,</hi> Son of <hi>Etheldred,</hi> called the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> (Uncle to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wy</hi>
and <hi>Edward,</hi> Sons of <hi>Edmund Ironſide)</hi> after <hi>Hardicanute,</hi> was
advanced to the Royal Dignity; principally by means of Earl <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
(a powerful and imperious Lord) upon the account of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60932:21"/>
marrying the Earl's Daughter; ſo little was the Hereditary
Succeſſion of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings regarded: And that <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign
might be more ſecure, this Earl <hi>Goodwin</hi> cauſed the Eyes of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi>
the King's Brother, to be put out, and, ſome ſay, took away
his Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſſor</hi> growing old, having no Iſſue, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of the wicked Earl <hi>Goodwin</hi> growing not only inſolent, but
intolerable to him, declared <hi>Edward</hi> the Son of <hi>Edmund Ironſide</hi>
(his Couſin) his Heir: And to the end he might better ſucceed,
the King ſent to the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> to return his Nephew <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
(whom the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> had married to his Niece <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi>
Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> Emperor of <hi>Germany)</hi> which the King of
<hi>Hungary</hi> did; and upon <hi>Edward</hi>'s return, the <hi>Confeſſor</hi> declared,
that he or his Sons ſhould ſucceed in his Hereditary Kingdom of
<hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Confeſſor</hi> did not long hold in this Mind; for his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
<hi>Edward</hi> ſoon after dying, and leaving a Son <hi>Edgar</hi> unfit
for Government, either as to his Body or Courage; he decreed
that his Kinſman <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> (tho a Baſtard)
ſhould ſucceed him in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> which came to
paſs; and ſo a new Race of Kings have ſucceeded in <hi>England</hi> of the
<hi>Norman</hi> Race, whoſe original Title was from a Grant of a King of
the <hi>Saxon</hi> Race, and ſo the beginning creates little Title to an
Hereditary Succeſſion in the <hi>Norman</hi> Race. And now we'll ſee
how an Hereditary Succeſſion was obſerved in it; yet as in the
<hi>Saxon,</hi> ſo in the <hi>Norman</hi> Kings, none ſucceeded who was not of the
Royal Blood; as all the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> were of the Family or
Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William Rufus,</hi> the ſecond Son of the Conqueror, ſucceeded, his
elder Brother <hi>Robert</hi> then alive: So did</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, his elder Brother <hi>Robert</hi> living.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Stephen,</hi> the Son of the Conqueror's Siſter, ſucceeded <hi>Henry,</hi>
tho <hi>Henry</hi> left a Daughter <hi>Maud,</hi> or <hi>Matilda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> the Second ſucceeded <hi>Stephen, Maud, Henry</hi>'s Mother, yet
living; ſo his Succeſſion was not Hereditary, for <hi>Haeres non eſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt ſucceeded <hi>Henry</hi> the Second.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Richard, Arthur</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeffery, John</hi>'s
elder Brother then alive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> the Third ſucceeded <hi>John, Eleanor Arthur</hi>'s Siſter then
alive, who was Heir before him. So that of ſeven Succeſſions
after the Conqueror, but one <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, ſucceeded as Heir
to his Father, or the Conqueror.</p>
                  <p>Admit <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt ſucceeded as Heir to <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> and
<hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> as Heir to <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, yet <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d</hi>
did not ſucceed as Heir to <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> he being then alive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:60932:22"/>
Admit <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> was Heir to <hi>Edward the Black Prince,</hi>
eldeſt Son to <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> yet neither <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th, 5th,</hi> or <hi>6th,</hi>

the Daughter of <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence, John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi>'s elder
Brother.</p>
                  <p>So that of the Succeſſion of 14 Kings after the Conqueror,
there were but four, <hi>viz. Richard</hi> the Firſt, <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt and
Second, and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, which ſucceeded as Heirs to the
Conqueror, or his Heirs.</p>
                  <p>Admit <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> ſucceeded right, as Heir to <hi>Phillippa,</hi>
Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Clarence;</hi> yet if it be true, which <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
the <hi>3d</hi> ſays, (and which is confirmed by the Authority of
the Act of Parliament 1 <hi>Rich. 3.)</hi> that <hi>Edward</hi> was contracted to

the <hi>5th</hi> (if it may be called a Succeſſion) ſucceed right,

in Right of his Wife <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the eldeſt Daughter of <hi>Edward</hi>
the Fourth.</p>
                  <p>But whether it be true or not, that <hi>Edward</hi> was contracted to
<hi>Eleanor Boteler</hi> before his Marriage, yet <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> ſucceeded
not as Heir, <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> the Son of <hi>George</hi> Duke
of <hi>Clarence, Richard</hi>'s elder Brother, being then alive.</p>
                  <p>Of all the Kings of <hi>England</hi> that ſucceeded the Conqueror,
<hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> had the leaſt Pretenſion to any Title to the Crown;
for tho he were ſuppoſed to have been deſcended from <hi>John</hi> of
<hi>Gaunt,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> yet it was the Duke's <hi>Paramour, Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine
Swinford,</hi> whoſe Iſſue by the Duke, tho by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
they were legitimated to all other purpoſes, yet were not
capacitated to ſucceed to the Crown of <hi>England:</hi> but if the Title
of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> had been preferable to that of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> had
been of the legitimate Line, yet could not he have ſucceeded as
Heir, his Mother, under whom he claimed, being then alive, and
out-lived her Son.</p>
                  <p>Nor did the King's Marriage with <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> eldeſt Daughter
of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> improve his Title to his Succeſſion, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
being ſubſequent to it; and before it the Crown, by Act
of Parliament, was entailed upon <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th,</hi> and the Heirs
of his Body; and after Marriage he never uſed her Name in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
any Parliament, or in any Proclamation, or the Coin, or
paſſing any Act of Parliament; and as he reigned without her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Marriage, ſo he did after her Death, (for he out-lived her)
tho ſhe left two Sons, <hi>Arthur</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> (after <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth)

                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems to me, that <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi>
had the ſame Opinion, which <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> and the Parliament
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60932:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had, that the Iſſue of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> were not legitimate, for
he would not aſſent to the Marriage of his Daughter <hi>Katherine</hi>
with <hi>Arthur,</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> ſo long as the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi>
(Son of the Duke of <hi>Clarence)</hi> lived; and there a fine Trick was
found out to put the poor Prince to Death, for endeavouring to
make his Eſcape out of the Tower with <hi>Perkin Warbeck,</hi> and in
him ended the Maſculine Line of the Race of the <hi>Plantagenets,</hi>
who had governed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation after <hi>Stephen,</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the
<hi>7th,</hi> above 340 Years. So that from the Conqueror to <hi>Henry</hi>
the <hi>8th,</hi> ſcarce one of four of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ſucceeded in
a right Line, as Heirs to the Conqueror.</p>
                  <p>As the <hi>Saxon</hi> Dynaſty ended in <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> and the
<hi>Norman</hi> began in the Conqueror, ſo it ſeems to me that the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
ended in <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> and another of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> was
erected in <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th,</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Edmund</hi> of <hi>Hadham,</hi>
the Son of <hi>Owen Tudor,</hi> by <hi>Katherine</hi> Daughter of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>6th</hi>
of <hi>France,</hi> Wife of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and Mother of <hi>Henry</hi>
the <hi>6th.</hi> So that <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th</hi>'s Title to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> was
better than that to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> for that of <hi>England</hi>
was from a Maternal Anceſtor, <hi>Margaret</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Richmond,</hi>
no otherwiſe related to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> than deſcended
from <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> by <hi>Katherine Swinford</hi> his Paramour: Tho
I do not find that <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th,</hi> or any of his Deſcendants, ever
aſſumed the Sirname of <hi>Tudor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that tho the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> neither in the <hi>Saxon</hi> nor
<hi>Norman</hi> Race of Kings, was always Hereditary, ſo neither was the
Succeſſion to the Crown elective: For in elective Kingdoms, after
the Death of one King, there is an Eſtabliſhment of the manner
of Elections; and in the mean time there are <hi>Cuſtodes Regni</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
whoſe Power ceaſes upon the Election of a King; but
neither of theſe were ever heard of in either of the <hi>Saxon</hi> or
<hi>Norman</hi> Race: and tho ſometimes it's ſaid the Kings were choſen,
as of <hi>Edward</hi> the Son of <hi>Alfred,</hi> by the Nobles, and ſo of <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi>
and ſo in the <hi>Norman</hi> Race, <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt was ſaid to be
choſen for that he promiſed to abrogate all the Oppreſſions and
Errors brought into the Government by his Father and Brother,
(tho his eldeſt Brother <hi>Robert</hi> was then alive) and reſtore the
good Laws of <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> was choſen by
the Clergy and <hi>Londoners,</hi> yet this was rather a form of Speaking
in thoſe days, than any formal Election; and the manner differed
according to the different Humours of the Times.</p>
                  <p>Nor do we read that ever the Parliament meddled with the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the Crown before <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth; for tho the firſt
Parliament of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third renounced their Allegiance to
<hi>Edward</hi> the Second, and are ſaid to have choſen <hi>Edward</hi> the Third,
yet they went no further; and ſuch an Election was no more than
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60932:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a Declaration of their Submiſſion, as when the Council declared
<hi>James</hi> the Second King.</p>
                  <p>But whether the Crown of <hi>England</hi> was Hereditary in the <hi>Saxon</hi>
and <hi>Norman</hi> Race, it's evident it was not ſo in this <hi>Britiſh</hi> Race; for
as it began in <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, ſo it was entailed by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon him, and Heirs of his Body before his Marriage with
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> the eldeſt Daughter of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth. So the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritable
Right of <hi>Edward</hi>'s Iſſue, and all the <hi>Norman</hi> Race was
barred by this Act.</p>
                  <p>Before we proceed in the Succeſſion of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Race, we'll
take a view of the Genealogy of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> by <hi>Katherine Swinford,</hi> had Iſſue <hi>John,</hi> created
Earl of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> who had Iſſue <hi>John,</hi> created Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi>
who had Iſſue <hi>Margaret.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, <hi>Katherine</hi> his Wife (Siſter
of <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth of <hi>France)</hi> married <hi>Owen Tudor,</hi> a <hi>Welch</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
who had Iſſue <hi>Edmund</hi> of <hi>Hadham,</hi> created Earl of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
who married <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter and Heir of <hi>John</hi> Duke
of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> who had Iſſue <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth ſucceeded his Father without any Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for the Wars between the houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> had
deſtroyed the whole legitimate <hi>Lancaſtrian</hi> Line, and <hi>Richard</hi> the
Third, after the Murder of his Brother <hi>Clarence,</hi> and Death of
<hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, had murdered his two Nephews, <hi>Edward</hi> and
<hi>Richard,</hi> (Sons of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth) and himſelf was killed in
the Fight in <hi>Boſworth-fields;</hi> and after that <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh had
put <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> (Son of the Duke of <hi>Clarence)</hi> to
Death, none of all the Royal Line of the <hi>Plantagenets</hi> were left
to be Competitors with him; yet his Succeſſion could not be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary,
for his Grand-mother, under whom his Father claim'd,
out-lived her Son, and ſo <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth could not claim from
her. Yet this is obſervable, That as his Father, <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh,
entailed the Succeſſion of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> upon the Heirs
of his Body, ſo by Act of Parliament, <hi>(28 Hen. 8.) Henry</hi>
the Eighth might diſpoſe of the Succeſſion of the Crown by his
Will, for want of Iſſue of his Body; ſo little was the inheritable
Succeſſion of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> regarded by theſe Kings of
the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Race.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems the Council in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's Reign, had as little
an Opinion of the Hereditary Succeſſion of the Crown, as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
had in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, for by the Advice
of <hi>Edward</hi>'s Council, he by his Will diſpoſed of the Succeſſion
to his Couſen the Lady <hi>Jane Gray</hi> (Grand-daughter to <hi>Edward</hi>'s
Aunt, <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>France)</hi> contrary to the Will of his Father
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, which ordained his Daughter <hi>Mary</hi> to ſucceed
<hi>Edward,</hi> in caſe he died without Iſſue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:60932:23"/>
I ſay, that by the Law of Inheritance in <hi>England,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi>
could not inherit the Crown from <hi>Edward,</hi> ſhe being but of half-Blood
to him; and by the ſame Reaſon Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> could not
inherit to Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> but <hi>Mary</hi> the Daughter of <hi>James</hi> the fifth
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being of the whole Blood to <hi>Edward,</hi> and deſcended
from the elder Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, could.</p>
                  <p>For the Opinion of the Judges, after King <hi>James</hi> came in, that
the Succeſſion of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> differs from that of the
Inheritance of Subjects in regard of an <hi>Alien</hi> born, and thoſe of
half Blood may inherit the Crown; it's <hi>Gratis dictum,</hi> and ſaid
to pleaſe the King; for there never was any ſuch uſage in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
nor any ſuch Act of Parliament to warrant their Opinion.</p>
                  <p>But admit the Crown of <hi>England</hi> were inheritable from <hi>Henry</hi>
the Seventh, and Half-Blood no Bar to the Succeſſion, yet <hi>Mary</hi>
and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> could not both ſucceed; for one of them was Illegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> being born in the Life of <hi>Katherine</hi> Queen
<hi>Mary</hi>'s Mother.</p>
                  <p>If the Parliament in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> had little or no
Opinion of the Inheritable Succeſſion of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi>
and therefore impowered the King to diſpoſe of it by Will: The
Parliament in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had leſs, and therefore
often petitioned her, and that with Importunity, to declare her Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
without Conſent in Parliament, and declared it 13 <hi>Eliz. Cap.
1.</hi> to be High Treaſon to affirm that the Crown of <hi>England</hi> might
not be diſpoſed of by Act of Parliament in her Life, and a <hi>Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire</hi>
after her Death. Here I make theſe Remarks upon the Race
of the <hi>Plantagenets,</hi> and the Succeſſion of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Line, that
as the <hi>Plantagenets</hi> inherited the Name from <hi>Jeffery</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi>
who was never King of <hi>England;</hi> ſo <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th,</hi> if he had any
Title, derived it from <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> (by an Illegitimate Succeſſion)
who never was King of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>England</hi> we ſtep into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſee how the Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Succeſſion was obſerved there after the Reign of <hi>Alexander</hi> the
<hi>3d,</hi> in whom the direct Line of the Race of their Kings failed,
which was, ſo near as I can compute, about the Year 1278, and leave
the Succeſſion of their 93 Kings before, to the Scrutiny of the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi>
Antiquaries and Heraulds.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scots,</hi> if they be not clearer in the Genealogy of their 93
Kings before <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> than my Author is of retrieving it
after the Death of <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> do
make but a blind Genealogy of their 93 Kings before; however
we'll take it as we find it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David,</hi> Brother of <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (but whether
<hi>William</hi> was Father, Brother or Uncle to <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> my
Author ſays not) and Earl of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> had Iſſue by <hi>Maud,</hi>
Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> three Daughters, <hi>Margaret</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60932:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to <hi>Allen</hi> of <hi>Galloway,</hi> the ſecond (not named) was married to
<hi>Robert Bruce;</hi> the third to <hi>Henry Haſtings</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntingdon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Allen</hi> of <hi>Galloway</hi> had a Grand-daughter, named <hi>Dornagil,</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to <hi>John Baliol.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bruce</hi> was Great Grand-child to the ſecond Daughter of <hi>David</hi>
Earl of <hi>Huntingdon;</hi> but being a Male, pretended he was to be King
before <hi>Dornagil,</hi> a Female, though a Degree nearer, and deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the elder Siſter. <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntingdon</hi> made no
claim. So the Right between <hi>Baliol</hi> and <hi>Bruce</hi> was referred to the
Determination of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, King of <hi>England,</hi> who adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Right to be in <hi>Baliol,</hi> and ſoon after <hi>Baliol</hi> by <hi>Dornagil</hi>
had a Son named <hi>Edward;</hi> ſo that <hi>Bruce</hi>'s Pretenſion of Title as
being Son, vaniſhed by the Birth of <hi>Edward Baliol,</hi> being deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the eldeſt Siſter. But</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> (or a prevailing Party) not liking <hi>Baliol</hi>'s Reign, in
the Year 1306 crowned <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> King.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1310 <hi>Bruce,</hi> by Acts of Parliament, had the Crown of
<hi>Scotland</hi> entailed upon him and his Heir-male; and for want of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
to his Brother <hi>Edward,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Robert</hi> had Iſſue a Son named <hi>David,</hi> and a Daughter married
to <hi>Robert Stuart,</hi> and by Act of Parliament ſettled the Crown upon
his Son <hi>David;</hi> and for want of Iſſue by him, to <hi>Robert Stuart,</hi>
his Grand-child by his Daughter. So here is the Succeſſion of the
Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> twice differently ſettled by Parliament, to the
diſinheriting of <hi>Edward Baliol.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in the Year 1332 <hi>Edward Baliol</hi> (the right Heir) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and crowned King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> After that, <hi>David Bruce</hi>
recovered the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and afterwards was taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
by the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> in the Abſence of her Husband
<hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and being releaſed, he died <hi>Ann.</hi> 1370.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Robert Stuart</hi> (Grand-ſon of <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> by his Daughter) ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<hi>David,</hi> who married <hi>Euphemia</hi> Daughter of the Earl of
<hi>Roſs;</hi> but before he was King, had Iſſue by <hi>Elizabeth Moor,</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine,
two Sons, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Robert,</hi> and by the Queen he had Iſſue
<hi>Walter</hi> Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern;</hi> yet by Act of
Parliament the King diſinherited his Legitimate Iſſue, and ſettled
the Crown upon his Iſſue by <hi>Elizabeth Moor,</hi> from which Iſſue all
the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> have ſince deſcended.</p>
                  <p>This was the moſt unaccountable Accident, if we conſider the
Cauſe and Conſequence (I think) that is recorded in any Hiſtory,
That a King and Parliament, by the Importunity of a Slut, ſhould
diſinherit his Legitimate Offſpring from the Succeſſion to the Crown
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to advance her ſpurious Iſſue.</p>
                  <p>It's true, for ſome Reaſons of State, the right Heir is ſet aſide,
as <hi>Edward,</hi> Son of <hi>Ethelred</hi> (after the <hi>Confeſſor)</hi> being young, and
not a fit Match to oppoſe the <hi>Danes, Edmund Ironſide,</hi> tho Illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60932:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for his Strength and Courage, was ſaid to be choſen King,
as moſt likely to withſtand the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Invaſions; ſo <hi>Edward the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor</hi>
obſerving the heavy and ſlow Nature of <hi>Edgar</hi> (the Grandſon
of <hi>Edmund Ironſide)</hi> not to be a fit Match to oppoſe the turbulent
aſpiring Faction of <hi>Harold,</hi> and his Family, named <hi>William</hi> Duke
of <hi>Normandy,</hi> his Succeſſor: but none of theſe were Reaſons for
the Depoſing the Earls of <hi>Athol</hi> and <hi>Strathern,</hi> being for ought I
find, much better qualified to reign than either <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Robert,</hi> the
Iſſue of <hi>Elizabeth Moor;</hi> for <hi>John</hi> was of a heavy and unactive Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
not fit to govern, which made the King his Father to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
his younger Brother <hi>Robert</hi> Vice-Roy, a Man of a violent and
inveterate Diſpoſition. So that theſe three <hi>Dynaſties, viz.</hi> the
<hi>Norman, B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>itiſh</hi> and <hi>Scotiſh,</hi> were all derived from ſpurious Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals;
and as <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> was deſcended from <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi>
(who was never King) by <hi>Catherine Swinford,</hi> ſo is the Race of
<hi>Scotland</hi> from <hi>Robert Stuart,</hi> the firſt of that Name (before he was
King) by <hi>Elizabeth Moor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though the Parliament erected this Dynaſty of the Kings of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> yet this did not ceaſe their Power of altering the Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it in a right Line: For <hi>James</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> had two Sons, <hi>James</hi>
the <hi>3d,</hi> who ſucceeded him, and <hi>Alexander</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> married two Wives, the firſt was a Daughter of the
Earl of <hi>Orkney,</hi> by whom he had a Son named <hi>Alexander,</hi> and after
married a Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Bulloign,</hi> by whom he had a Son
named <hi>John;</hi> yet in <hi>James</hi> the <hi>5th</hi> his Reign, <hi>John</hi> was by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
declared the ſecond Perſon of the Kingdom, and next Heir to
<hi>James</hi> the Fifth, notwithſtanding the Claim and Proteſtation made
by <hi>Alexander (John</hi>'s elder Brother) againſt it. And the <hi>Scots</hi> out
of Parliament aſſumed a Power not only of altering the Succeſſion
of their Kings, but of depoſing them: For in the Year 1567, they
depoſed Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> (the Daughter of K. <hi>James</hi> the <hi>5th)</hi> and ſet
up King <hi>James</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> (after King <hi>James</hi> the <hi>1ſt</hi> of <hi>England)</hi> an
Infant (ſcarce 14 Months old) in her ſtead; and by this Title he
reigned in <hi>Scotland</hi> twenty Years in his Mother's Life, and to his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Day owned this Title.</p>
                  <p>Yet this King, and his Son, and two Grandſons after him, gloried
in declaring their Titles to be by inherent Birth-right, and that they
were accountable only to God for all their Actions: Here (how truly
let the Reader judg) the Scene was laid, upon which they played
their deſigned Game, which did not end ſo.</p>
                  <p>I do not account the Dynaſty of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> in the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi>
Race ſince Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to be new in the Succeſſion of the
Perſons of the four laſt Kings, I mean King <hi>James</hi> the <hi>1ſt,</hi> King
<hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>1ſt,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> the ſecond;
yet I ſay it was new in the Exerciſe of it, and ſuch as none of the
<hi>Saxon, Daniſh,</hi> or <hi>Norman</hi> Race ſince <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> or of the <hi>Britiſh</hi>

Race, ever pretended to claim: But in regard it has put the Nation
into ſuch a Ferment for above 80 Years, and which, if God pleaſes
not to put an end to, may prove as fatal to theſe Nations, as the
Feuds between the <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibelines,</hi> did for above 300 Years o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelm
<hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> in moſt horrible Blood-ſhed and Deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation,
we are more particular in taking a View of the Original
of it.</p>
                  <p>From the time of the King's coming to <hi>London, May</hi> the <hi>7th,</hi> to
the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> little more than eight Months, <hi>Stow</hi> takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of twelve Proclamations, and upon the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> out
comes another for calling a Parliament, which though new for the
manner, yet more new for the Subſtance, and ſuch as never before
was heard of in <hi>England:</hi> And that we may the better take a
view of the ſucceſs of the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> in this King's Reign,
from this we will ſtay a little, and conſider the Conſtitution of a
Parliament, and the principal Ends of its meeting.</p>
                  <p>The King is the Head, Principle and End of the Parliament; the
Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, which are made up
of Knights of the Counties of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> Citizens ſent
from Cities, Burgeſſes ſent from Corporations, and Barons ſent
from the <hi>Cinque Ports,</hi> which do not differ from Burgeſſes, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Name, are the Body; the Temporal Nobility ſit in Parliament
in their perſonal Capacities, but the Spiritual Nobility do not ſo,
but in right of their Biſhopricks, which they hold of the King
by Barony; and the Commons are ſaid to be the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive-Body
of all the Commons in <hi>England;</hi> not Noble by Birth,
or in their Politick Capacities, as the Biſhops are: and in this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
reſides the Supreme Authority of the Nation, which as they
make Laws for the publick Benefit, for are they looſe from them, and
are not obliged to them.</p>
                  <p>As the King is freed from the imputation of Tyranny in ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Laws, and of Oppreſſion in taxing the Subjects; for how can
the Subjects complain of either, when their Repreſentatives in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
promote them? So does a Parliament diſcharge the great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
againſt Hereditary Monarchies, that tho Princes ſee only with
their own Eyes, and hear with their own Ears, as other Men do; yet
ſo as it is impoſſible without a true Repreſentation of the State of
their Subjects, they can ſee or hear of the true State of them;
whereas Minions and Flatterers, whoſe Intereſt is different from that
of the Kingdom, not only conceal the true State of the Nation,
but make falſe Repreſentations of it, to raiſe themſelves tho out of
the publick ruine: but the Parliament is the Eye of the Nation,
which ſees the Abuſes, which Flatterers by abuſing the King's Name,
and making it ſubſervient to their Intereſt, impoſe upon it. The great
Ends of the Meetings of Parliament are, firſt, to redreſs the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of the Nation, if any be, by repreſenting them to the King.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60932:25"/>
Secondly, to puniſh Men, which are out of the reach of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Rules of Juſtice, which either abuſe the King's Name to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Ends, or may prove dangerous to the Government.
Thirdly, to make Laws againſt growing Evils, and to repeal Laws
which have been found inconvenient to the Nation. And fourthly,
to ſupply the King upon extraordinary Occaſions for Support of the
Nation, as Times and Accidents may happen.</p>
                  <p>Heretofore the Meetings of Parliament were ſo frequent, that
Sir <hi>John Thompſon,</hi> in his Preface to the Earl of <hi>Angleſey</hi>'s Memoirs,
takes notice, that from the firſt of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> to the <hi>14th</hi> of
<hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> which was but 85 Years, there are 72 Original Writs
for the Summons of Parliament; ſo that if you allow forty Days
from the Teſts of the Writs to the Returns, and but one Month for
the Sittings of Parliament, there will not be a Year's Interval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Diſſolution of one Parliament and the Summoning ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> proves that they were annual, and fixt to meet
on the firſt, or the Kalends of <hi>May,</hi> which continued down to <hi>Edward</hi>
the <hi>1ſt,</hi> how or whether diſcontinued by <hi>Edw.</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> I cannot tell;
however, there are two Laws yet in force for the annual Meeting of
the King in Parliament, one the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> the <hi>3d, c.</hi> 14. the other
36 <hi>Edward 3. c.</hi> 10. and when Parliaments thus frequently met, Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
were nipt in the Bud; the Courts of Law kept to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of Juſtice uprightly; the Ambition of great Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained;
Factions and Innovations ſuppreſſed: and when the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
met thus frequently, the King had an Account of the State
of the Nation, and upon Redreſs of Grievances, if any were,
the Parliament in acknowledgment of their Duty gave the King a
Gratuity, ſometimes a Fifteenth, other times a Subſidy, and at
other times a Subſidy and a Fifteenth, and ſometimes a Subſidy and
two Fifteenths; but never more before the 35 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and the
King in return, granted a general Pardon to his Subjects, with ſuch
Exceptions as the Parliament pleaſed: and thus a mutual Love and
Underſtanding between the King and his Subjects was nouriſhed and
encreaſed.</p>
                  <p>Whereas by the long diſcontinuance of Parliaments, Grievances
multiply and take Root, ſo as they become ſo much more difficult
to be redreſſed, by how much longer the Diſcontinuances laſt: The
Favourites by their flattering the Prince, not only keep him in Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of the State of his Subjects, but fix the Prince ſo to their
Will, that it becomes ſo habitual in him, that the Prince prefers
them before his Subjects, and their Flatteries before the Advice of
his Parliament, and often takes their parts before that of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Nation.</p>
                  <p>Theſe long Intervals of Parliaments you'll ſee will beget long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
and the Members get to be choſen by the Favour of great
Men, and vaſt Expence; ſo that the Grievances with the Parliament
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60932:26"/>
ſhould redreſs, become diffuſed into the Body of the Parliament,
than which nothing can be more dangerous to the Conſtitution of
Parliament. Beſides, that the publick Buſineſs may not be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
during the Seſſions of Parliament, the Members of
both Houſes have Privileges whereof they are the only Judges,
both in their own Perſons, and of their Servants, whereby they are
exempted from Arreſts, or any Proceſs at Law, which is not only
grievous to the Subjects, but oft the Ruine of them. But now it's
time to ſee, what the King's Proclamation for calling his firſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
tended to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Before King</hi> James <hi>his coming to the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of Members in the Houſe of Commons was ſo free, that the
Letters of the King, or any Noble Man, to chuſe a Member, was
judged Cauſe ſufficient to render the Election void; but the King
by this Proclamation gives order, what Sorts of Men, and how
Qualified, ſhould be choſen by the Commons, and concludes,</hi> We
Notify by theſe Preſents, That all Returns, and Certificates of Knights,
Citizens and Burgeſſes, ought and are to be brought to the Court of
Chancery, and there to be filed upon Record; and if any be found to be
made contrary to this Proclamation, the ſame is to be rejected as unlawful
and inſufficient, and the City or Borough to be fined for the ſame; and
if it be found that they have committed any groſs or wilful Default or
Contempt in the Election, Return, or Certificate, that then their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
according to the Law, are to be ſeized as forfeited: And if any
Perſon take upon him the Place of a Knight, Citizen or Burgeſs, not
being duly elected and ſworn, according to the Laws and Statutes in that
behalf provided, and according to the Purport, Effect and true Meaning
of this our Proclamation, then every Perſon ſo offending to be fined and
impriſoned for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Never was ſuch a Prelude to the Meeting of a Parliament, by any
of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> either of the <hi>Saxon, Daniſh, Norman,</hi> or
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Race: and if the King in the Beginning thus extends his
firſt Note above <hi>ELA,</hi> to what Pitch will he ſtrain his Prerogative
hereafter? However ſince Forfeitures of Charters, Fining and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning
of Members not elected and returned according to this
Proclamation, were the Penalties impoſed by it for the better Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
it might have been declared, who ſhould judg of theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
and Returns, or by what Law?</p>
                  <p>It fell out unluckily, I think I may ſay deſignedly, that upon
the opening of the Parliament, ſeveral of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
one of which was Sir <hi>Herbert Crofts,</hi> coming to hear the King's
Speech in the Houſe of Lords, had the Door ſhut upon them, and
were repulſed by a Yeoman of the Guard, one <hi>Bryant Caſh,</hi> with the
uncivil and contemptible Terms of, <hi>Goodman Burgeſs you come not
here.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:60932:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The King, in a long and tedious Speech (which you may read at large
in <hi>Stow</hi>'s Chronicle) after he had expreſſed his Thanks to the whole
Nation for their Univerſal Acclamations, in receiving him for their
undoubted Sovereign, which ſo much conduced to their Happineſs
in the Union of all Claims in his Perſon, being the undoubted Heir
of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7, and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Eldeſt Daughter of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi>
wherein the Titles of the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled:
He tells them the Wonders which he will do, both in
reference to the inward and outward Peace of the Kingdom,
which how well he performed, you will hear hereafter: But as
to the Glory which he aſcribes to himſelf of being King by inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Birthright from <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. and his Queen, I think he could not
have taken a worſe Topick for what he ſo much gloried in.</p>
                  <p>For no hereditary Monarch has a better Title to his Crown, than
the Anceſtor from whom he firſt claims, had; and it is evident,
<hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> had no Colour of Title to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> by
Inheritance, being only deſcended from <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> by <hi>Katherine
Swinford</hi> his Concubine, when <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi>'s Wife was alive;
nor could the King claim any Title from the Wife of <hi>Henry</hi> the
<hi>7th,</hi> for <hi>Henry</hi> himſelf would never own ſhe had any, reigning not
only during her Life without naming her in the Coins, Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
or Laws, but after her Death; and was not only crowned
without her, but called a Parliament without her, ere he was
married to her, and had the Crown entailed upon him, and the
Heirs of his Body, before he married her. Beſides, there is no
Averment againſt an Act of Parliament, and the Act of the firſt
of <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> declares all the Iſſue of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> by the
Lady <hi>Grey</hi> (the Mother of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th</hi>'s Wife) to be Illegitimate,
and ſo uncapable of any Inheritance to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how edified ſoever the Commons were with the King's
Speech, they were little pleaſed with the Yeomen of the Guards
uſage of their Members, which in due time the King ſhall hear
of. However the King, who, ſince his coming in, had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
only with Flatteries, introduced with the Epithet of
<hi>moſt ſacred,</hi> (which I find rarely applied to any of his Predeceſſors,
and how properly applied to him, giving himſelf up to a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and prophane Life, let another judg) was buoyed up with a
mighty Expectation of the Succeſs of his Proclamation and Speech,
which did not ſucceed accordingly.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament met on <hi>Monday</hi> March the <hi>19th,</hi> and a Debate
hapning in the Houſe of Commons about the Return of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of Sir <hi>Francis Goodwin</hi> and Sir <hi>John Forteſcue,</hi> for Knight
of the Shire for the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi> the Commons, <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>23d</hi>
upon a full hearing determined Sir <hi>Francis</hi> to be lawfully elected
and returned.</p>
                  <p>An. Reg. 2. An. Dom. 1604. <hi>Tueſday,</hi> March the <hi>26th,</hi> The
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60932:27"/>
Lords, by Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hone,</hi> ſent a Meſſage to the
Commons, that the former Committees may (in a ſecond Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to be had) have Authority to treat touching the Caſe of Sir
<hi>Francis Goodwin,</hi> the Knight of <hi>Bucks,</hi> firſt of all before any other
Matters were proceeded in.</p>
                  <p>The Commons returned Anſwer, that they do conceive that
it did not ſtand with the Honour of this Houſe to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Proceedings and Doings: but if their Lordſhips
have any Purpoſe to confer for the Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>due, that then they will
be ready at ſuch time and place, and ſuch number as their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
ſhall think meet.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> &amp;c. delivered from the Lords, that their
Lordſhips taking notice in particular of the Return of the Sheriff
of <hi>Bucks,</hi> and acquainting his Majeſty with it, his Highneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
himſelf engaged, and touched in Honour, that there might
this be ſome Conference of it between the two Houſes, and to that
end ſignified his Pleaſure unto them, and by them to Houſe.</p>
                  <p>The Commons by their Speaker give their Reaſons to the King,
why they cannot confer with the Lords: The King in return,
charges the Commons to admit a Conference with the Judges:
the Commons give Reaſon and anſwer Objections, why they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
confer with the Judges, and the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> deliver them at the
Council-Chamber by Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> deſiring that their Lordſhips
would be Mediators in behalf of the Houſe for his Majeſty's ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:
the King in return, commanded as an <hi>Abſolute King,</hi> that
there might be a Conference between the Houſe and Judges.</p>
                  <p>The Houſe upon return hereof, reſolved to confer with the
King, in preſence of the King and Council, and named a ſelect
Committee for the Conference; but the Succeſs being doubtful, Sir
<hi>Francis Goodwin</hi> fearing this might cauſe a Rupture between the King
and the Houſe, and to remove all Impediments to the worthy and
weighty Cauſes, which might by this time have been in a good
furtherance, deſired another Writ of Election for a Member in
his ſtead.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, and other Accidents ſucceeding, wherein the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
ſuppoſing themſelves aggrieved; the Commons upon the <hi>16th</hi>
of <hi>June,</hi> in an humble Apology to his Majeſty, repreſent their
Privileges, and wherein they conceive themſelves aggrieved.</p>
                  <p>The Stubborneſs of the Commons, for ſo the King would have
it, ſo diſſonant from the Flatteries he had conſtantly ſounding in
his Ears, and of being an Abſolute King by <hi>Inherent Birth-right,</hi>
put the King ſo out of Conceit with Parliaments, that in all his
Life, till the laſt Parliament of his Reign when neceſſity brought
him to it, he was never reconciled to them. But that we may more
clearly ſee what followed, we will look back into the Reign of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:60932:27"/>
There were three things which the Queen was impatient of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
debated in Parliament, the Succeſſion of the Crown after her
Death, her Marriage, and the making any Alterations in the Church,
as it was eſtabliſhed in the firſt Year of her Reign.</p>
                  <p>But the Commons having a fearful Eye of a Relapſe into Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
after the Nation had been freed from it, and the Queen of
<hi>Scots</hi> being zealouſly addicted to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and having
not only aſſumed the Arms of <hi>England,</hi> as next Heir to Queen
<hi>Elizabeth;</hi> but upon her Return from <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> by
many Embaſſies ſolicited Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that ſhe might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
her Succeſſor, in caſe Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> died without Heirs
of her Body: To prevent this, the Commons in manifold Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
to the Queen, petitioned her to marry, and declare her
Succeſſor; and after the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s Conſpiracy, and the
Rebellion in the North under the Earls of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and
<hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> wherein it appeared the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was privy
and conſenting, in all the Parliaments (I think) from the <hi>9th</hi> of
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi>'s Death, the Commons were
importunate with the Queen to cut her off, which you may read
at large in the Journals of the Parliaments of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſet
forth by Sir <hi>Simon D' Ewes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Queen fixed in theſe Reſolutions, did often forbid the
Parliament, upon their Allegiance, to enter into Debates upon
them: yet ſome zealous Members, the principal of which was one
Mr. <hi>Peter Wentworth,</hi> as well in the caſe of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> as
for ſome Reformation in the Church, did ſeveral times endeavour
to have them debated, upon which the Queen committed them to
the Tower, tho ſoon after they were diſcharged: This the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in their Apology to the King take notice of, and pray that
this be no Precedent for the future, but that their Debates in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
may be free: but they ſhall find that this King's little
Finger, and his Son's after him, ſhall be heavier upon them than
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Loins.</p>
                  <p>However this Apology of the Commons tended to a Rupture
between the King and them within, yet the King was reſolved
to have Peace without the Kingdom, how inconſiſtible ſoever the
Terms were; and to that end upon the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following,
being the ſecond Year of his Reign, he concluded a firm Peace with
<hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Albert</hi> and <hi>Iſabel</hi> Arch-Dukes of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi>
&amp;c. and alſo a Treaty of Commerce, which as it was the
moſt beneficial to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, ſo it was difficult, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
to obſerve the Peace: the King, as he had managed it,
made the Treaty of Commerce to be but little beneficial to the
Nation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the Year before the King had renewed the Treaty of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
which Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>had made with the</hi> Dutch <hi>States,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60932:28"/>
where, tho the King was not obliged to maintain ſuch a number
of Men for the</hi> Dutch <hi>Support againſt the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid
at the end of the War, whereby the Treaty with the Queen,</hi>
Anno 1598. <hi>the</hi> Dutch <hi>were not only to pay, but to repay the
Queen yearly</hi> 100000 l. <hi>till a Peace was made with</hi> Spain, <hi>when
they were to pay her two Millions of Money, with the Intereſt
of</hi> 10 per Cent. <hi>deducting the</hi> 100000 l. per Annum <hi>they were
to pay; yet by the fourth Article of the ſaid Treaty it was agreed,</hi>
That neither the Kings of <hi>England</hi> nor <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhall themſelves give,
or ſhall conſent to be given by any of their Vaſſals, Subjects or Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
Aid, Favour or Counſel directly or indirectly, on Sea, Land, or
freſh Waters; nor ſhall ſupply or miniſter, or conſent to be ſupplied or
miniſtred, by their ſaid Vaſſals, Inhabitants or Subjects, unto the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
or Rebels of either Part, of what Nature or Condition ſoever they
be (whether they ſhall invade the Countries and Dominions of either
of them, or withdraw themſelves from their Obedience and Subjection)
any Souldiers, Proviſion of Victuals, Monies, Inſtruments of War,
and whatſoever Aid elſe to maintain War: and the five Articles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all former Leagues, Confederacies, Capitulations and Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>But tho theſe two Articles pointed as directly as the Wit of Man
could deviſe, and to which King <hi>James</hi> ſware, to withdraw the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> out of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Service againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
yet had the King no more Courage to do it, than he had to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the 600000 <hi>l.</hi> now due from the <hi>Dutch</hi> to him, by their
Treaty with Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in 1598. And King <hi>James</hi> to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate
this, made it worſe, by granting the King of <hi>Spain</hi> Licence to
raiſe what Forces he could in any of his Dominions to fight againſt
the <hi>Dutch;</hi> ſo prodigal was the King of the Expence of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Blood Abroad, to keep an unſettled Peace at Home, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he might follow his Pleaſure and Luxury, and aſpire to a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over his Subjects, which none of his Predeceſſors ever
claimed.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>James</hi> in the <hi>7th</hi> Article excuſes the delivery of <hi>Fluſhing,
Brill, Rammekins,</hi> and other Forts in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poſſeſſion in the
<hi>Netherlands,</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe of the Contracts made
between Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the States, by which ſhe being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in Faith and Honour, it was not free for him to reſtore the
ſame to the Arch-Dukes; yet, on the Word of a King, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
to enter into a Treaty with the ſaid States, wherein he will
aſſign a competent time to them, to accept and receive Terms
agreeable to Juſtice and Equity, for a Pacification with the Arch-Dukes,
(to whom the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had aſſigned the Dominions
of the <hi>Low-Countries)</hi> which if the <hi>States</hi> ſhall refuſe, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
from henceforth, as being freed from the former Conventions,
will determine of the ſaid Towns, according as it ſhall be juſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60932:28"/>
and honourable, wherein the ſaid Princes, his loving Brethren, ſhall
find there ſhall be no want in him of thoſe good Offices, which
can be expected from a Friendly Prince. How well the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
his Promiſe you will hear hereafter; but I find no time
ſet by the King, when he entered into any Treaty herein with the
<hi>States.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and Arch-Dukes got but little by this Treaty
of Peace, ſo did the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, as the King had ordered it,
get as little by the Treaty of Commerce: for if you conſider Man
in his Nature he is born naked, and the generality of Mankind
have nothing to feed, clothe, provide an Habitation, or defend
themſelves with, but as they are aſſiſted by other Men; and as
they are born to nothing, but what they get from others, ſo if
any rob or ſteal from another any thing, this will be an Injury to
that other: Nor does Man, born in this poor State, know how to
get, or be ſupplied by another with either Food, Raiment, or an
Habitation, but as he ſhall be taught or inſtructed by another; ſo
that after all, the generality of Mankind in their moſt perfect
State, eat their Bread by the Sweat of their Brows, and in the
Cares of their Mind. To debar therefore any Man from his honeſt
Labours, whereby he gets his Subſiſtence, is a greater Violation of
the Law of Nature, than to rob another, and equal to the depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
another by Injuſtice of an Eſtate whereon a Man lives, and is
a greater Injury than the Tyranny of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> over the Children
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in compelling them to make Brick, yet denying them
Straw: for this impoſed upon the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> a greater Hardſhip
how to live, whereas that denies poor Men their Means of living;
and by Conſequence, it is a greater Tyranny and Injuſtice for any
Man, or Company of Men, either by Law, or without Law, to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
to themſelves a Monopoly in any lawful Imployment exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
to other Men, than to rob any of them; for this but hinders
them in their Livelihood, whereas that takes from them all their
Means of living.</p>
                  <p>Nor are Monopolies leſs impolitick than injurious; for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining
the Labours and Induſtry of Men in any Profeſſion, Art
or Myſtery, in any Country to a few, does not only hinder the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of them in that Country, but makes open a Way to
the People of other Countries, not only to enlarge, but improve
them, as much to their Benefit, as to the Loſs of that Country,
where they are reſtrained to a few.</p>
                  <p>And if Monopolies be ſo wicked, impolitick and injurious, in
reſtraining the Labours and Induſtry of Men, the monopolizing
the Product of Mens Labour by Navigation in Foreign Trade is
not leſs but more; for no Man will labour who cannot enjoy the
Fruits of his Labour; and the great Benefit herein which <hi>England</hi>
enjoys, is, that being the greater and better part of the Iſle of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60932:29"/>
                     <hi>Britain,</hi> it abounds with more noble and better Ports (except
<hi>Ireland)</hi> to vend the Product of Mens Labours upon the Materials
which it abounds with, than any other Country. To monopolize
therefore the Foreign Vent of our Manufactures to any Men, or
Company of Men, is doubly injurious, not only to our Artificers
in them, but to thoſe Countries which might otherwiſe reap the
Benefit of them, and by this Reſtriction gives other Countries the
opportunity of ſupplying them.</p>
                  <p>Nor does the Injury and Impolicy of reſtraining the Foreign
Vent of our Manufactures ſtay here, for by it infinite People might
be ſupplied with manifold things from other Countries, as Pitch,
Tar, Hemp, Flax, Bees-wax, Elephants Teeth, Raw Silks, all ſorts
of dying Stuffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereof the Nation ſtands in need; which
being reſtrained to a few, the Nation cannot be ſupplied by them,
and ſo multitudes of Manufacturers are denied the Fruits of their
Labours; and hereby they become ſo dear, that thoſe who imploy
themſelves in them, cannot without extraordinary Pains ſubſiſt,
and thereby give the Foreign Vent of them to other Nations,
where theſe are more plentiful and cheap.</p>
                  <p>Nor does the Injury and Impolicy of monopolizing of Foreign
Trades end here; for as the Riches of <hi>England</hi> are derived from
our Foreign Trades, ſo is the Strength and Glory of it founded
in Navigation, which (Trade being a principle to it) will be ſo
much leſſened, as the Foreign Vent of our Manufactures and their
Returns are reſtrained. We have thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a better View may be had of what follows.</p>
                  <p>The firſt day the King came to <hi>London</hi> after the Death of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth, viz.</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> he iſſued out a Proclamation to
ceaſe the exacting all Monopolies and Protections that hindred
Mens Suits in Law, and to forbid the Oppreſſions done by <hi>Salt-Peter</hi>-Makers,
Purveyors, and Cart-takers; but this was too hot to
hold.</p>
                  <p>For the Treaty of Peace and Commerce with <hi>Spain</hi> was no
ſooner made, but the King made a Monopoly of the Trade to
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> by incorporating it in a Company excluſive to
other Men: Hereupon the Parliament then ſitting, made that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
Law founded upon thoſe unanſwerable Reaſons of a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Intereſt,</hi> and the manifold Inconveniences the incorporating
thoſe Trades in a Company brought to the Navigation of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
both in the Foreign Vent of our Manufactures, and in their
Returns, to the Ruin of infinite Artificers, Sea-men and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights,
and to the Diminution of the King's Revenue: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
theſe Trades were declared free, and have ever ſince conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
ſo, to the ineſtimable Benefit of this Nation.</p>
                  <p>But tho the Reaſons in this Act extend to all other Beneficial
Trades, as to <hi>Turkey,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt-Country,</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh</hi> Trades, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60932:29"/>
to <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> yet all theſe Trades are monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
into Companies, excluſive to other Men, as much to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of the Nation, as the making the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade free was
beneficial to it.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Clergy (at leaſt a Faction, which ſtiled
themſelves the Clergy) made an Attempt to try how far their
Doctrine of <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> in the King had taken root in him;
they had gained their Point ſo far, as the King had declared his
Command to the Commons as <hi>Abſolute King,</hi> and now they'll ſee
whether the King would aſſert it, and the Caſe was this.</p>
                  <p>Arch-biſhop <hi>Whitgift</hi> (a Prelate of ſingular Piety and Humility)
died the laſt day of <hi>February,</hi> in the firſt Year of the King, and
Doctor <hi>Richard Bancroft</hi> (a Man of a rough Temper, a ſtout Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball-player)
as zealous an Aſſertor of the Rights of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> or rather a Faction of Church-men, who arrogated to
themſelves the Title (as <hi>Julius</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> was of the Papacy) exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
to the King and Council 25 Articles in the Name of all the
Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> called <hi>Articuli Cleri,</hi> which were deſired to be
reformed in granting Prohibitions, tho there were a Parliament
and Convocation then ſitting, which I do not find had any hand
in it.</p>
                  <p>This Exhibition, as it aſcribed an <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> to the King,
ſo it ſtruck directly at the Conſtitution of Parliaments, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
End of which is to redreſs Grievances and Abuſes in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and if the King's Council, during the ſitting of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſhall aſcribe to themſelves this Power, then the great End
of Parliaments redreſſing Grievances and Abuſes is in vain: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>Bancroft</hi> herein, not only makes the King's Council to have
a concurring Power with the Parliament, but paramount to it, by
exhibiting theſe Articles in the ſitting of a Parliament and Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
but the Judges gave ſo clear and diſtinct an Anſwer to
them all, that the King did not think fit to meddle in them; yet
did not <hi>Bancroft</hi> reſt here, as you will hear hereafter. The Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and the Judges Anſwer to them, you may read at large in
Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>'s ſecond <hi>Inſtitute, tit. Articuli Cleri.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt <hi>Bancroft</hi> was thus aſcribing to the King this <hi>Abſolute
Power,</hi> and exalting a Faction of Church-men, above the true
State of the Clergy, which is one of the three States of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and above the Nobility and Commonalty, which are the other
two: The Popiſh Faction were plotting a Deſign, not only to
deſtroy the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but the very Perſon of the King,
with the Nobility and Commons convened in Parliament, which
was to have been executed upon the fifth of <hi>November</hi> following,
the day on which the Parliament were to meet.</p>
                  <p>The Popiſh Party hoped (and it may be not unreaſonably)
that the King, in regard of his Mother's Religion, was not averſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60932:30"/>
to theirs, ſo that if he became not of their Church, (which in
his Speech at the opening the Parliament, he owns our Mother-Church)
at leaſt hoped to have their Religion tolerated; whereas
finding the King in his Speech, after he had declaimed againſt the
Hereſies and Abuſes crept into their Church, and the Pope's having
arrogated an Imperial Civil Power over Kings and Emperors, by
dethroning and decrowning them with his Foot, and diſpoſing
of their Kingdoms; and the Jeſuits Practice of aſſaſſinating and
murdering Kings, if they be curſed by the Pope: That ſo long
as they maintained theſe, they were not ſufferable in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
From this time forward, and it may be before, a Popiſh
Crew contrived how to bring in their Catholick Religion, they
cared not which way, ſo it might be done. At laſt it was agreed
upon the opening of the Seſſion of Parliament upon the <hi>5th</hi> of
<hi>November,</hi> one part of the Conſpirators ſhould blow up the Lords
Houſe, while the King, Prince, with the Nobility and Commons
were in it (having prepared all things in a readineſs) whilſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part ſhould ſeize upon the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (after Queen of
<hi>Bohemia)</hi> and proclaim her Queen: But the Plot being diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Conſpirators were defeated of both their Deſigns.</p>
                  <p>The Horror and Terror of this Conſpiracy, (the Diſcovery
whereof was induſtriouſly divulged and believed to be by the
King's great Wiſdom and Care) reconciled for a time all Differences
between him and his Parliament; and the Parliament to gratify the
King, the Clergy gave him four Subſidies at four Shillings in the
Pound, and the Temporality three Subſidies and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ix Fifteenths,
(which was threefold more than any Parliament, in one Seſſion,
gave Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> before that of the 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Payment of her Father's, Brother's and Siſter's Debts, her

the Rebellion in the <hi>North,</hi> the Support of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi>
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> War, and the Overthrow of the <hi>Spaniſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada</hi>
in 88.) The Parliament enacted the Oath of Allegiance,
which <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> under the Name of <hi>Tortus,</hi> wrote againſt, and
<hi>Andrews</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> under the Name of <hi>Tortura Torti,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
it. The Parliament too ordained the Anniverſary of the
Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> to be celebrated for a perpetual Thankſgiving-Day
for the King and Kingdom's Delivery from this Conſpiracy.
All Heats about <hi>Prerogative</hi> and <hi>Privilege</hi> were now laid aſide;
the Pulpits and our Univerſities rang with Declamations againſt the
Hereſies and Uſurpations of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and now the
King gave himſelf wholly to Hunting, Plays, Maſques, Balls, and
writing againſt <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the Pope's Supremacy, in arrogating
a Power over Kings, and diſpoſing of their Kingdoms; and thus
the Caſe ſtood for four Years after, wherein I ſcarce find any
thing worth mentioning.</p>

                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:60932:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This and the next Year was almoſt wholly ſpent in Debates,
concerning the Uniting of the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi>
which the King eaneſtly ſolicited, and which ended only in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts
and Arguments, for the Houſe of Parliament refuſed to join
with the King in it: however the King obtained a Judgment in
<hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> in a Caſe called <hi>Calvin's Caſe,</hi> that the <hi>Poſt Nati</hi>
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> after the King's Aſſumption to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi>
were free to purchaſe and inherit in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whilſt the King was thus wallowing in Pleaſure, he wholly
gave himſelf up to be governed by Favourites, to whom he was
above any other King of <hi>England</hi> (except <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th)</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
prodigal, not only in Honours and Offices, but of the
Revenues of the Crown, and Aids given in Parliament; and theſe
being of both Nations, <hi>Scotch</hi> as well as <hi>Engliſh,</hi> made them to be
the more intolerable: All things being at Peace Abroad, Publick
Affairs were neglected, or ſcarce thought of, whilſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſtill
grew more powerful at Sea, and without any Aid from the King,
were Matches for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> by Land; and <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th</hi>
of <hi>France</hi> was accumulating incredible Treaſure at Home, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Foundation of vaſt Deſigns Abroad, whereof the King
took no notice, his Genius lying another way.</p>
                  <p>In theſe Debates at Home, and Lethargy of State of Foreign
Affairs, the Prerogative-Clergy ſwelled the High Commiſſion to
ſuch an height, that it was complained of as a Grievance in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
as you may read in <hi>Arthur Wilſon</hi>'s Hiſtory of <hi>Great Britain,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the Articles exhibited to the King, againſt granting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions,
and that the Parliament was ſtill ſitting) repeated his
Exhibitions: But however the King inclined to favour <hi>Bancroft,</hi>
he had not Courage enough to over-rule the Judges Anſwer to
them, it may be for fear the Parliament ſhould interpoſe, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſe
them to grant him more Money, whereof already he ſtood
in great need.</p>
                  <p>But the Parliament, however they gratified the King for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from the Popiſh Conſpiracy, did not think fit to pour it
forth ſo plentifully now in times of Peace, to be profuſely thrown
upon Favourites and Minions, who were no more Friends to them,
than they to the eſtabliſhed Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſupply the King's Neceſſities, as he made them, one Doctor
<hi>Cowell</hi> (no doubt ſet upon by <hi>Bancroft,</hi> and thoſe called the Church)
the next Year after publiſhed his <hi>Interpreter,</hi> wherein he premiſes
theſe three Principles: Firſt, That the King was <hi>Solutus a Legibus,</hi>
not bound by his Coronation-Oath. Secondly, That it was not <hi>ex
Neceſſitate,</hi> that the King ſhould call a Parliament to make Laws,
but might do it by his <hi>Abſolute Power.</hi> Thirdly, It was a Favour
to admit the Conſent of the Subjects in giving Subſidies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:60932:31"/>
                     <hi>Cowell</hi>'s <hi>Interpeter,</hi> approved by the King, as the Civil Law was
highly extolled by the King (See <hi>Wilſon, fol. 46.)</hi> was not only
printed, but publickly ſold without Impunity; and this gave En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to the publiſhing many others to the ſame purpoſe,
among which one <hi>Blackwood</hi> publiſhed one, which concluded that
we were all Slaves, by reaſon of the Conqueſt.</p>
                  <p>The Commons, tho they took no notice of <hi>Bancroft,</hi> and his
Articles againſt Prohibitions, took Fire at theſe, and intended to
have proceeded ſeverely againſt him; but the King interpoſed, and
promiſed to call in theſe Books by Proclamation, as he did, but
they were out, and the Proclamation could not call them in, but
only ſerved to make them more taken notice of: But this had not
the deſired Effect of getting more Money, than one Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Dutch States</hi> in 1598, whereby Eleven hundred thouſand

But tho the King had not Courage enough to demand the

                  <p>Long Parliaments beget long Intervals, in which Grievances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſo multiplied and fixed, that they become ſo much more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult

ſince the King could not get Money of the Parliament, and was
afraid to demand any of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> let's ſee what Courſes he took
to get Money, during the Interval from this Parliament to the
meeting of the next, which was five Years, and how the Caſe
ſtood with them.</p>
                  <p>In the opening of the firſt Parliament, the King tells them,
that he was ſo far from encreaſing their Burden with <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> as
that he had ſo much, as either Time, Occaſion, or Law could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
lightned them; and, at that time, had been careful to reviſe
and conſider deeply upon the Laws made againſt them, that ſome
Overture may be propoſed in Parliament for clearing thoſe Laws
by Reaſon (which is the Soul of the Law) in caſe they have been
in times paſt, further or more rigorouſly executed by Judges than
the meaning of the Law was, or might tend to the Hurt as well of
the innocent as guilty Perſons.</p>
                  <p>At the Diſſolution of the Parliament, the King's principal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
were <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> (Brother to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi>
whom Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> beheaded) tho a Papiſt, yet Lord Privy-Seal;
<hi>Robert Cecil,</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> Lord Treaſurer; <hi>Philip</hi> Earl
of <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> (for a certain Reaſon); <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Walden,</hi> (Son

Rich,</hi> after Earl of <hi>Holland, Engliſh:</hi> the Earl of <hi>Dunbar,</hi>
Sir <hi>Alexander Hay,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Carr</hi> (who in a ſhort time ſhall
overtop them all) <hi>Scotiſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was a Story current in thoſe Times, which I have heard
from ſome credible Perſons which did live in that time, That
King <hi>James</hi> having given Sir <hi>Robert Carr</hi> a Boon of 20000 <hi>l.</hi> my
Lord Treaſurer <hi>Salisbury,</hi> that he might make the King ſenſible
of what he had done, invited the King to an Entertainment, and
ſo ordered it, that before the King ſhould come at it, he ſhould
paſs through a Room wherein he had placed four Tables, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
each Table lay 5000 <hi>l.</hi> in Silver; when the King came into
the Paſſage, he ſtarted, and was amazed at the ſight (having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
before ſeen ſuch a Sum) he asked the Treaſurer the meaning
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60932:32"/>
of it, who told the King, <hi>It was the Boon he had given Sir</hi> Robert
Carr: <hi>Swounds Man!</hi> (the Oath he uſually ſwore) <hi>but five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
ſhould ſerve his turn,</hi> and ſo for that time the Treaſurer ſaved
the King the other fifteen thouſand Pounds.</p>
                  <p>To ſupport theſe Favourites, and other of the King's Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of leſs Note, was all the King's Care, notwithſtanding his
Foreign Affairs, or his Proclamation at his firſt coming to <hi>London</hi>
againſt Monopolies, or his Speech at the opening of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But ſince Money cannot be had by Parliament, other means
muſt be found out.</p>
                  <p>There were many ways uſed for raiſing Monies during this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval
of Parliament: Firſt, Monopolies which ſwarmed more
than in any King's Reign before. Secondly, Payments for new
invented Knighthoods, never before heard of in <hi>England</hi> in Times
of Peace, called <hi>Baronets:</hi> the Prince was 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and the King to
quicken the Market, promiſed to make but 200 of them; tho
when this Market was done, he kept it up all his Life-time after.
Thirdly, Tho the <hi>Baronets</hi> paid for their Honours, yet the King
iſſued our Commiſſions for reviving the old <hi>Obſolete Laws,</hi> for
making Men which could expend 40 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> to compound
for not being Knighted. Fourthly, Payments for being made
Knights of <hi>Nova Scotia.</hi> Fifthly, The purchaſing of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours

and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Honours, I do not find ſet Prices of theſe; <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of the ſame Title to have the Precedence of an <hi>Iriſh,</hi> as a
<hi>Scotiſh</hi> Baron, Viſcount or Earl, to have the Precedence of an
<hi>Iriſh:</hi> and tho an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Honour of like Degree had the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of either of the other, yet if either of the other had a
higher Title, he ſhould precede an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Peer under a leſs; as
a <hi>Scotiſh</hi> or <hi>Iriſh</hi> Viſcount ſhall precede an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Baron, ſo ſuch
an Earl ſhall precede an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Viſcount. Seventhly, Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon defective Titles. Eighthly, Compoſitions for <hi>Aſſart</hi>
Lands. Ninthly, Monies for making Prince <hi>Henry</hi> Knight. Tenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Monies to marry the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the <hi>Palſgrave.</hi> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly,

                  </p>
                  <p>During this Interval of Parliament, was perpetrated a moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Murder upon the Perſon of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> which is
the more remarkable if it be conſidered how far (tho the King

how to advance himſelf in this great Power: Of theſe Sir <hi>Thomas

Earl, they were not leſs on fire to my Lord of <hi>Rocheſter;</hi> and that
theſe Flames might ſoar in an equal height, the Counteſs, by the
help of Mrs. <hi>Turner,</hi> procures one Doctor <hi>Foreman</hi> (as he was
called) to bewitch <hi>Rocheſter</hi> into equal Deſires of mutual Love
with the Counteſs; and now Familiarity between the Counteſs
and <hi>Rocheſter</hi> becomes publickly ſcandalous.</p>
                  <p>However the Earl continued his Love to the Counteſs, but
withal acquainted her with the Diſhonour ſhe brought upon him,
and more upon her ſelf by her looſe Life, which was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſo publickly taken notice of: this was ſo far from reclaiming
the Counteſs, that it ſtung her to the quick, and inſtead of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
ſhe, by Letters to Mrs. <hi>Turner, who</hi> (the Counteſs ſays)
<hi>is all her hopes of Good in this World,</hi> and by her to Dr. <hi>Foreman
(whom ſhe calls ſweet Father, and ſubſcribes her ſelf his Affectionate
Daughter,</hi> Frances Eſſex) endeavours to procure the Doctor to
bewitch the Earl to Frigidity towards her.</p>

Earl of</hi> Somerſet, <hi>at his Trial for the Murder of Sir</hi> Thomas Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
<hi>gives Sir</hi> Thomas <hi>hard words, as,</hi> That there was little in him
that was ſolid for Religion, or Moral Vertue, but was wholly poſſeſt with
Ambition and vain Glory, and was loth to have any Partners in my
Lord of <hi>Rocheſter</hi>'s Favour; and that to flatter my Lord in his unlawful
Love with the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> had made his Brags
that he had won <hi>Rocheſter</hi> the Love of the Counteſs, by his Letters and
Induſtry.</p>

                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:60932:33"/>
But theſe ſtoln Pleaſures could not ſatisfy the Counteſs's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
and that ſhe might enjoy them to be compleat, ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
ſince the Deſign of poiſoning the Earl did not ſucceed, to
make way to her Deſires of marrying <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> by ſuing out a
Divorce againſt the ſaid Earl, which ſhe acquaints <hi>Rocheſter</hi> with,
and <hi>Rocheſter</hi> and the Counteſs acquaint the Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi>
who before was privy, and conſenting to the Familiarity between
them, and was eaſily induced to join in procuring a Divorce.</p>
                  <p>Tho this was agreed between them, yet the Viſcount would not
proceed further, till he had conſulted Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting
he (the <hi>Viſcount)</hi> would do nothing without his Advice:
Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> told him, <hi>The marrying the Counteſs would not be only
hurtful to his Preferment, but helpful to ſubvert and overthrow him,
and who would (being poſſeſt of ſo great Poſſibilities as he was, ſo
great Honours and large Revenues, and daily in expectation of others)
caſt all away upon a Woman, noted for her Injury and Immodeſty, and
pull upon himſelf the Hatred and Contempt of great Perſonages for ſo
ſmall a matter.</hi> Then he willed the Viſcount to conſider with
himſelf the Condition of the Counteſs, the manner of her Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
from her Youth, her preſent Converſation, the many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies,
Diſhonours and Diſlikes which attend upon her; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
which is the Opinion of the Vulgar (and he ſhould find
it ſo) many Evils to attend his Subverſion and Overthrow; <hi>That
it was not the Nature of a wiſe Man to make her his Wife, whom he
had made his Whore.</hi> Laſtly, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> adviſed him that he ſhould
expect no better Requital from her, than ſuch as ſhe had ſhewed
to her former Husband; and withal to weigh the preſent Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he is in, and compare it with the future, and much more
to this purpoſe; and that Honour is not attended by Voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
nor the Ruines of a rotten Branch to be cheriſhed upon a
new planted Tree; but if he (the Viſcount) meant to be made
famous, and to continue that with him which he now freely
enjoyed, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his Opinion was, <hi>That he ſhould utterly leave
and forſake the Counteſs's Company, and hold her both hurtful and
hateful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rocheſter</hi> was ſurpriſed at <hi>Overbury</hi>'s Advice, and the more, by
how much leſs he expected it, and falls out with <hi>Overbury,</hi> and
gives him harſh Language: but <hi>Overbury</hi> retorts again, and perſiſts
in his Advice, and demands his Portion due to him of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi>
and ſo leaves him to his own Fortunes.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Rocheſter</hi> was ſurprized at <hi>Overbury</hi>'s Advice, the Counteſs
was enraged at it, ſo as nothing leſs than <hi>Overbury</hi>'s Blood could
appeaſe her Revenge; but how to compaſs it would be a work of
time, and required deep Conſideration, Secrecy and Reſolution.
But we leave this Affair here to take a view of other Occurrences
which happened this Year, 1610.</p>

To the King's former Monopolies, he this Year added another
which cauſed many Commotions here, and endangered a Rupture
with the <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and this was the Caſe. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> at this time
were not skilled in the Art of <hi>dreſſing</hi> and <hi>dying Engliſh Woollen
Manufactures,</hi> but after they were made here they were vented in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Holland,</hi> where they were <hi>dreſſed and dyed:</hi> Alderman <hi>Cockaine,</hi>
and ſome rich Citizens, having, as was ſaid, promiſed <hi>Rocheſter,
Northampton,</hi> and the Lord Treaſurer, great Sums of Money to
procure them a Patent for <hi>dreſſing</hi> and <hi>dying</hi> of <hi>Cloths,</hi> and that
the King would ſeize into his Hands the Charter of the Merchant-Adventurers
for tranſporting of <hi>white undreſſed Cloths; Cockaine</hi>
pretending, that beſides the enriching the Nation, multitudes of
poor People might be employed to the Benefit of the Nation,
which now were a Burden to it: Hereupon the King ſeizes upon
the Merchant-Adventurers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Patent, and grants to <hi>Cockaine,</hi> and
others, a new Patent for <hi>dreſſing and dying Cloths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Cockaine</hi>'s Project ſucceeded both ways quite contrary, for
the <hi>Dutch</hi> prohibited the Importation of <hi>Engliſh dreſt and dyed
Cloths from</hi> England; and <hi>Cockaine,</hi> and his Company, not only
dyed and dreſſed the Cloths worſe and dearer (which are ever
the Conſequences of Monopolies) than they were in <hi>Holland,</hi>
but theſe being reſtrained to a Company, they could not near dreſs
and dye the Cloths made in <hi>England:</hi> Whereupon the making
Cloths ſtood at a ſtand, and infinite Numbers of poor People,
which were imploy'd in making Cloths, lay idle, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to a ſtarving Condition; this raiſed great Clamours, which
arrived at the Council; which to pacify, the Council permitted
ſome quantities of white Cloths to be tranſported, but this did
at preſent but skin the Soar, not cure it, as you will ſoon hear.</p>
                  <p>This Year was wounded up in a mournful <hi>Cataſtrophe,</hi> for upon
the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> Prince <hi>Henry</hi> died, in the beginning of the
Bloſſom of his Youth, being 18 Years, 8 Months, and 17 Days
old: A Prince adorned with Wiſdom and Piety above his Years,
Strength and Ability of Body equal to any Man, of a Noble and
Heroick Diſpoſition, and an hater of Flatteries and Flatterers, and
therefore fell flat at odds with <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> not once giving him any
Countenance, or vouchaſafing him his Company.</p>
                  <p>I have heard my Father (who was about the Prince's Age) tell
ſeveral Stories of him: Once when the Prince was hunting the
Stag, it chanced the Stag being ſpent, croſſed the Road, where a
Butcher and his Dog were travelling; the Dog killed the Stag,
which was ſo great that the Butcher could not carry him off:
When the Huntſmen and Company came up, they fell at odds with
the Butcher, and endeavoured to incenſe the Prince againſt him;
to whom the Prince ſoberly anſwered, <hi>What if the Butcher's Dog
killed the Stag, what could the Butcher help it?</hi> They replied, <hi>If
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60932:34"/>
his Father had been ſerved ſo, he would have ſworn ſo as no Man could
have endured it: Away,</hi> replied the Prince, <hi>all the Pleaſure in the
World is not worth an Oath.</hi> Another time, when the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
came to take his leave of the Prince, the Ambaſſador asked
him, <hi>What Service he would command him to his Maſter;</hi> the Prince

if <hi>Henry</hi> had been young, as he was in the <hi>57th</hi> Year of his Age
he could not have lived to have accompliſhed it: at his Death,
tho he lived but 13 Years after the Treaty of <hi>Vervins,</hi> when he
made Peace with <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> he had amaſſed ſuch a
Treaſure, as is incredible, if ſo great an Hiſtorian as <hi>Meſſeray</hi> did
not teſtify it; eſpecially if it be conſidered, that before the
Treaty at <hi>Vervins, France</hi> had for forty Years before been imbroiled
in a Civil War, and with <hi>Spain;</hi> and theſe Wars being in all the
Parts of <hi>France, France</hi> was never before in ſo poor and feeble a
State, and <hi>Henry</hi> himſelf after the Peace giving himſelf up to
Venery and Gaming above any King of <hi>France</hi> before him, or ſince.
Nor can it be imagined from whence ſuch Treaſures ſhould ariſe,
for there are no Gold nor Silver Mines in <hi>France,</hi> unleſs it were
from the Trades which the <hi>Engliſh, Dutch, Dane, Swede</hi> and <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghers</hi>
drove into <hi>France.</hi> However <hi>Henry</hi> was addicted to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Gaming, yet otherwiſe he excelled all the Kings of the
Age, not only in Heroick Vertues, but in Prudence, Conſtancy
and Secrecy in his Deſigns; curious in Enquiry into the Qualities
of Men, whom he would prefer as Qualities merited; and was
pleaſant and witty in his Converſation, and always diſpoſed to
take the Impreſſion of good Counſel.</p>
                  <p>He left his Son (a Prince of weak Conſtitution both of Body
and Mind) at ten Years of Age, and his Wife (an imperious
bigotted <hi>Italian</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> Regent: Theſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
all the Methods which <hi>Henry</hi> had laid for promoting the
<hi>French</hi> Grandure, and gave themſelves up to be governed by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites,
yet in a different manner from thoſe in <hi>England,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they ſquandered away all that ineſtimable Treaſure which
<hi>Henry</hi> left, in leſs than half the time <hi>Henry</hi> had been collecting it;
and put all <hi>France</hi> into Tumults and Wars, whilſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
ſubmitted to the Exorbitances of King <hi>James</hi> his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
and by Proclamations were forbid to mention them, or talk
of their Government, no not in Parliament: And now 'tis time
to return to <hi>England,</hi> and ſee what's doing there.</p>
                  <p>If we begin this Year 1612, with <hi>January,</hi> we ſhall find two
Marriages in it, to ſucceed the two Deaths of the two famous
<hi>Henry</hi>'s of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> The firſt upon the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi>
being <hi>Shrove-Sunday,</hi> between <hi>Frederick,</hi> Count Palatine of
the <hi>Rhine,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Palſgrave,</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
the King's only Daughter; and the Triumphs, Pageant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and other Gaieties upon the <hi>Thames,</hi> in the City and Inns of
Court, far exceeded any before ſeen in <hi>England,</hi> which you may
read at large in <hi>Stow</hi>'s Chronicle, <hi>fol.</hi> 1004. ſo as the Tears for
the Death of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> were overflowed by the exceſs of Joy
for this Marriage.</p>
                  <p>However <hi>Northampton</hi> was not pleaſed with it, nor the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60932:35"/>
or King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and from the ſame Cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> It would
ſo far advance the Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>Germany</hi> as to make it
more formidable to the Popiſh Religion; and 'tis certain (for I
had it from good Authority) that Queen <hi>Ann</hi> was averſe to it;
and to put the Princeſs out of conceit of it, would uſually call
her Daughter, <hi>Goodwife Palſgrave;</hi> to which the Princeſs would
anſwer, <hi>ſhe would rather be the</hi> Palſgrave'<hi>s Wife, than the greateſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt
Queen in</hi> Chriſtendom. The Reaſon of the Queen's Averſion
to this Marriage is not ſaid, but certain it is, that theſe fading
Joys for this Marriage were ſucceeded by fixt and real Calamities,
which the King took little Care to prevent, and ſhall never live to
ſee, nor his Son after him, an end of.</p>
                  <p>While the Preparations for ſolemnizing this Marriage were mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
a different ſort was making for another, between the Viſcount
<hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and to make the Way to it
more paſſable, two Rubs were to be removed, one to take off Sir
<hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> the other to procure a Divorce, not only a <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa
&amp; Toro,</hi> between the Earl and the Counteſs, but a <hi>Nullity,</hi>
whereby the Counteſs ſhould be free to marry as ſhe pleaſed, and
ſhe had agreed upon the Perſon.</p>
                  <p>To remove Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> it was agreed between the Earl of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton,
Rocheſter,</hi> and the Counteſs, that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ſhould be
ſent Ambaſſador to the Great Duke (or Emperor) of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> ſo
that if Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> did accept of it, he ſhould be far enough out of
the way to hinder this Deſign; and if he did not, to commit him
to the Tower, where they would do well enough with him.
The Buſineſs of the Embaſſy was no ſooner propounded to the
King, but aſſented to by him; and Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was not unwilling
to undertake it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How harſh ſoever</hi> Rocheſter <hi>was to Sir</hi> Thomas, <hi>when he diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
Rocheſter <hi>from marrying the Counteſs, yet now he becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
kind to Sir</hi> Thomas, <hi>and tell him,</hi> how much he relied upon
his Integrity and Parts, which, in his Abſence, he ſhould not only
want, but that thereby Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> would give Occaſion to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
which were many, and upon <hi>Rocheſter</hi>'s account to ruine him,
when as it would not be in <hi>Rocheſter</hi>'s Power to prevent it; but if
Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> would refuſe to undertake this Embaſſy, <hi>Rocheſter</hi> would,
in a ſhort time, undertake to reconcile him to the King, and Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
would in the mean time be at hand to aſſiſt him with his Counſel
upon all Occaſions.</p>
                  <p>This was all deep Diſſimulation, which Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> took to be
in good earneſt, and ſo Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> excuſed his going on this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,
and this was what <hi>Rocheſter</hi> deſired: Hereupon <hi>Rocheſter</hi>
poſſeſt the King, that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was not only grown inſolent
and intolerable to him, but to the King, by contemning him, in
refuſing to go on this Embaſſage: The King becomes incenſed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60932:35"/>
and the more, as 'twas commonly ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> had vented
ſome ſtinging Sarcaſms upon the Court, which came to the King's
hearing, and ſo ordered him to be committed to the Tower. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton</hi>
and <hi>Rocheſter</hi> had prepared the Buſineſs ſo, that Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Wade</hi> was removed from being Lieutenant of the Tower, and
Sir <hi>Jervis Elvis,</hi> a Gentleman wholly depending upon them; was
made Lieutenant of it.</p>
                  <p>Upon Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his Commitment, Sir <hi>Jervis Elvis,</hi> by Order
from <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> confines him cloſe Priſoner, ſo
that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his Father was not permitted to viſit him, nor
any of his Servants, tho one deſired he might be confined with his
Maſter. The Counteſs, that ſhe might not be behind-hand with
<hi>Rocheſter</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> had conſulted with Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> for a fit
Inſtrument to practiſe what was deſigned upon Sir <hi>Thomas:</hi> Mrs.
<hi>Turner</hi>'s Husband was an Apothecary, and had a Servant named <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Weſton,</hi> who ſince her Husband's Death was become very poor;
this Man was agreed by the Counteſs and Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> to be
Under-keeper to Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> and had a Promiſe of 200 <hi>l.</hi> Reward,
when Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ſhould be diſpatched; and that he might with
more Secrecy work his Deſign, the Lieutenant had Orders from
<hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> that no Man elſe ſhould come at Sir
<hi>Thomas,</hi> and <hi>Turner</hi> only to wait upon him at Table, and to give Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for his Diet and Drinks.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> thus mew'd up, and excluded from the Sight of his
neareſt Relations and Servants, upon the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> was begun
the Practice of poiſoning Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> in his Broth which <hi>Weſton</hi>
brought him; and this was continued with many Varieties of Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
till the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> when by a Glyſter (for which
the Adminiſter had 20 <hi>l.</hi> Reward) he was diſpatched: but the
Malice againſt Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> did not end with his Death; for the Blanes
and Bliſters which the Poiſon had cauſed upon his Body, were
interpreted to be the Effects of the <hi>French-Pox,</hi> and his Body was ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverently
buried in a Pit digged in a very mean Place.</p>
                  <p>Here we may ſee the unhappy Fate of Princes above other Men,
who neglecting their Duty, give themſelves up to be governed
by Minions and Favourites: for private Men are accountable only
for their own Actions, whereas Princes are accountable to God
and Fame for all the ill Actions of their Miniſters; and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ways was the King's Name uſed and abuſed in perpetrating
this black and horrid Murder: Firſt, in getting the King to ſend
Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> on the Embaſſage to <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> Secondly, in committing
him to the Tower for refuſal. Thirdly, in keeping him cloſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
there, which was a Practice never known before for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
that any Man ſhould be cloſe confined from all his Relations
and Servants; and 'twas a greater Villany to practiſe Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his
Death, while he was the King's Priſoner, than if he had been at
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60932:36"/>
large, as being more immediately under the King's Protection.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Conſiderations little affected the Court, and Sir <hi>Thomas
Overbury</hi>'s Deſtruction went but half way towards the deſigned
Marriage between <hi>Rocheſter</hi> and the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> but a
Commiſſion of <hi>Delegates</hi> under the Broad Seal, is iſſued out to
the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> Dr. <hi>Abbot,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>London,
Wincheſter, Ely, Litchfield</hi> and <hi>Coventry,</hi> and <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> Sir <hi>Julius
Caeſar,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Parrey,</hi> Sir <hi>Daniel Danne,</hi> Sir <hi>John Bennet,
Francis James</hi> and <hi>Thomas Edwards,</hi> Doctors of the Civil Law, at
the Suit of the Counteſs for a Divorce from the Earl of <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here you may ſee the Aſcendant <hi>Rocheſter</hi> and <hi>Northampton</hi> had
over the King; not only in getting this Commiſſion, wherein the
King's Name and Authority was abuſed; but they procured the
King in the hearing of the Counteſs's Cauſe to be her Advocate, in
anſwering the Objections which the Arch-Biſhop made againſt the
Divorce: ſo as this Matter was managed, the Biſhops of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>
Dr. <hi>Bilſon,</hi> of <hi>Ely</hi> Dr. <hi>Andrews,</hi> of <hi>Litchfield</hi> and <hi>Coventry,</hi> and
<hi>Rocheſter,</hi> with Sir <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Parrey,</hi> and Sir <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
Dunne,</hi> were for the Divorce; and that the Counteſs was
<hi>Virgo non vitiata,</hi> and that there was Frigidity in the Earl, and
the Marriage a Nullity; and decreed the Earl to repay the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs
her Portion: but the ABp, the Bp of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Bennet,
James</hi> and <hi>Edwards,</hi> Doctors of the Civil-Law, were againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Thus far was the King's Name and Authority abuſed, in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Murder of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> and the deſigned Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
between <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> for <hi>Overbury</hi>
being dead, and the Divorce obtained, the Counteſs muſt not loſe
the Title by this Marriage, and thereupon the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>November,
Rocheſter</hi> is created Earl of <hi>Somerſet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All things are now prepared for the hopeful Marriage; and that
the Solemnity at the ending of it might out-vie that of the <hi>Palſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi>
and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> upon the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> the
Earl and Counteſs were married at <hi>White-hall</hi> in the Preſence of the
King and Queen, Prince, and a great confluence of the Biſhop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
and Temporal Nobility; the Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> married
them, and Dr. <hi>Mountaine</hi> (Dean of <hi>Weſtminſter)</hi> preached the
Nuptial Sermon, and that Night there was a gallant Maſque of
Lords; but upon the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> following the <hi>29th</hi> there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Prince's Gentlemen which quite out-did this, and
pleaſed the King ſo well, that he cauſed it to be acted again on
the <hi>Monday</hi> following, being the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>January.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>White-hall</hi> was too narrow to contain the Triumphs for this
Marriage, they muſt be extended into the City, and upon the
<hi>4th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> the Bride and Bridegroom, accompanied by the
Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> my Lord Privy Seal, <hi>(Northampton)</hi> the Lord
Chamberlain, the Earls of <hi>Worceſter, Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Montgomery,</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:60932:36"/>
with a numerous Train of Nobility and Gentry, were invited to
a Treat in the City at <hi>Merchant-Taylors Hall,</hi> where my Lord
Mayor and Aldermen entertained them in their Scarlet Gowns:
At their Entry they were accoſted by a gratulatory Speech and
Muſick, the Feaſt (which was moſt ſumptuous) ſerved by the
choiceſt Citizens, ſelected out of the 12 Companies, in their
Gowns and rich Foines: After Supper they were entertained with a
<hi>Waſſaile,</hi> two pleaſant Maſques, a Play and Dancing; and after all,
the Bride and Bridegroom, with all this <hi>Noble Crew,</hi> were invited
to a Princely Banquet, and at three in the Morning the Bride and
Bridegroom returned to <hi>Whitehall:</hi> and before this Surfeit of
Pleaſure and Exceſs was well digeſted, the Gentlemen of <hi>Grays-Inn,</hi>
upon <hi>Twelfth-Day,</hi> invited the Bride and Bridegroom to a
Maſque. Thus theſe Gaieties though they out-lived the Year,
yet ended in the Holy-days of <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> as they began with
them, being the next Day after <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi> But before the end of
this Year, theſe Joys ſhall turn ſharp and ſower.</p>
                  <p>This Year 1614, as it was the Meridian of the King's Reign in
<hi>England,</hi> ſo was it of his Pleaſures; the King was exceſſively ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to Hunting and Drinking, not ordinary <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Wines, but ſtrong <hi>Greek</hi> Wines; and though he would divide his
Hunting from drinking theſe Wines, yet he would compound his
Hunting with drinking theſe Wines; and to that purpoſe he was
attended with a ſpecial Officer, who was as much as could be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
at hand, to fill the King's Cup in his Hunting, when he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it. I have heard my Father ſay, that being hunting with
the King, after the King had drank of the Wine, he alſo drank
of it; and though he was young, and of an healthful Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it ſo diſordered his Head, that it ſpoiled his Pleaſure and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
him for three Days after. Whether it were drinking theſe
Wines, or from ſome other Cauſe, the King became ſo lazy
and unweildy, that he was <hi>treiſt on Horſe-back,</hi> and as he was
ſet ſo would he ride, without otherwiſe poiſing himſelf on his
Saddle: Nay, when his Hat was ſet on his Head, he would not
take the pains to alter it, but it ſate as it was put on.</p>
                  <p>And as he thus gave himſelf up to Pleaſure, ſo he did to Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
and Flatterers, and ſcarce heard any thing without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
of <hi>Sacred, Peaceful, Wiſe, Moſt Learned,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe made
him careleſs both of his Domeſtick and Foreign Affairs, the
Thoughts of which diſturbed his Pleaſures; and if at any time he
was thoughtful, or penſive, his Favourites made it their Buſineſs
to mimick or ridicule thoſe things, eſpecially the <hi>Puritans,</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the King hated.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Courſes, and the King's Favourites perpetually ſucking
his Treaſures, brought the King to great Neceſſities, yet he had
not Courage enough to demand the Debt due to him from the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60932:37"/>
                     <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> neither Principal nor Intereſt: ſo that after
five Years interval a Parliament is agreed to be called, to ſupply
the King's Occaſions; and the principal Cauſe to excite the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to give Money, was for the Portion the King had paid for
marrying the Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the <hi>Palſgrave,</hi> and for his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
whilſt he was in <hi>England,</hi> tho the King had collected
Aid-Money all over <hi>England</hi> before.</p>
                  <p>But it rarely happens when Grievances be multiplied, and the
Kings become neceſſitous, that then the King and Parliament at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Ends; the Ends being ſo different, the Parliaments being
to redreſs Grievances, and the Kings to get Money: and ſo it
fell out in this Parliament, for entring upon Grievances, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating
them to the King, which was Language he was not
acquainted with, he in great Paſſion diſſolves the Parliament, and
commits many of the principal Members of the Commons cloſe
Priſoners, without <hi>Bail</hi> or <hi>Man-prize:</hi> and though no Law was
paſſed this Parliament, nor any Notice had of it in the Statutes
printed at large; yet this Benefit came of it, That the Commons
voting <hi>Cockaine</hi>'s Patent for <hi>Dreſſing and Dying Engliſh Cloths</hi> to be
a Monopoly and a Grievance, it was recalled and cancelled, and the
vent of <hi>White Cloths</hi> left free.</p>
                  <p>This was the greateſt Violation and Invaſion of the Privilege
of Parliament that ever was done by any King of <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
but though it began, it did not end here, neither in this
King's Reign, nor his Son's after him: For after the Diſſolution of
the Parliament, the King extorted a Benevolence from the Subject,
and thoſe who would not contribute, were to have their Names re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the Council.</p>

                  <p>IF from the Parliament we look into the Court, we ſhall ſee the
King's Affections begin to alter towards his Favourites, which
began upon this Occaſion: My Lord of <hi>Northampton</hi> was Lord
Warden of the Cinque-Ports, and by his Permiſſion <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts
in great Numbers ſwarmed into <hi>England;</hi> this was obſerved, and
great Clamours were made upon it, which came to the Earl's Ears:
hereupon the Earl exhibits an Information againſt ſome of them;
theſe juſtify the Truth of what they were accuſed of; the Arch-Biſhop
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60932:37"/>
                     <hi>Abbot,</hi> at the ſame time, produces a Letter from the Earl
to Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> wherein he ſays, <hi>That however the Condition
of the Times compelled him, and the King urged him to turn Proteſtant,
yet nevertheleſs his Heart ſtood for the Catholicks, and that he would
be ready to further them in any Attempt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This procured the King's Frowns, and the Priſoners Diſcharge;
whereupon 'twas ſaid <hi>Northampton</hi> took ſuch Grief that he made his
Will, wherein he declared <hi>He died in the ſame Faith wherein he was
baptized, [viz.</hi> the Popiſh) and died the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>June.</hi> Now was
<hi>Somerſet</hi> left without his chiefeſt Support, and ſoon after another
ſhall riſe up, which ſhall turn him quite out of the King's Favour.</p>
                  <p>About this time one Mr. <hi>George Villiers</hi> appeared in Court, the
youngeſt Son of Sir <hi>George Villiers</hi> of <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> by a ſecond
Venter, whoſe Name was <hi>Mary Beaumont:</hi> the Heraulds will tell
you ſhe was of the honourable Family of the <hi>Beaumonts;</hi> and I
will tell you what a Lady of Quality told me, and one who might
well know the Truth of what ſhe ſaid, her youngeſt Siſter by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Venter being married to the Eldeſt Son of Sir <hi>George Villiers,</hi>
by <hi>Beaumont.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mary Beaumont</hi> was entertained in Sir <hi>George Villiers</hi> his Family,
in a mean Office of the Kitchin; but her ragged Habit could not
ſhade the beautiful and excellent Frame of her Perſon, which Sir
<hi>George</hi> taking notice of, prevailed with his Lady to remove <hi>Mary</hi>
out of the Kitchin into an Office in her Chamber, which with
ſome Importunity on Sir <hi>George</hi>'s part, and unwillingneſs of my
Lady, at laſt was done.</p>
                  <p>Soon after my Lady died; and Sir <hi>George</hi> became very ſweet
upon his Lady's Woman, which would not admit any Relief with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Enjoyment; and the more to win <hi>Mary</hi> to it, gave her 20 <hi>l.</hi>
to put her ſelf into ſo good a Dreſs as this would procure, which
ſhe did, and then Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Affections became ſo fired, that to
allay them he married her.</p>
                  <p>In this Coverture Sir <hi>George</hi> had three Sons, <hi>John</hi> after Viſcount
<hi>Purbeck, Chriſtopher</hi> after Earl of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> and one
Daughter after married to the Earl of <hi>Denbigh:</hi> When Sir <hi>George</hi>
died, <hi>George</hi> was very young; and Sir <hi>George</hi> having ſetled his
Eſtate upon the Children born of his former Lady, could leave
the Iſſue by his Widow but very little, and her but a Joynture
of about 200 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> which dying with her, nothing could
come to theſe Children; nor was it poſſible for her, out of ſo
contracted a Joynture to maintain her ſelf and them, ſo as to
make ſcarce any Proviſion for them after her Death; and the Iſſue
of Sir <hi>George</hi> by his former Lady, both envied and hated her, ſo
as little could be expected from them.</p>
                  <p>To ſupply theſe Defects, ſhe married one <hi>Thomas Compton</hi> a
rich Country Gentleman, whereby ſhe became able to maintain
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60932:38"/>
and breed up her Children in a better than ordinary Education;
and <hi>George</hi> being of an extraordinary and exact Compoſition of
Perſon, was ſent abroad, and in <hi>France</hi> acquired thoſe outward
Advantages which more adorned the natural Parts, which Nature
had given him.</p>
                  <p>The King this Year, about the Beginning of <hi>March 16 14/15,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his uſual Methods, went to take his Hunting Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
at <hi>New-market;</hi> and the Scholars (as they called them) of
<hi>Cambridg</hi> who new the King's Humour, invited him to a Play,
called <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> to ridicule (at leaſt the Practice of) the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law: Never did any thing ſo hit the King's Humour, as
this Play did; ſo that he would have it acted and acted again,
which was increaſed with ſeveral Additions, which yet more
pleaſed the King.</p>
                  <p>At this Play it was ſo contrived, that <hi>George Villiers</hi> ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
with all the Advantages his Mother could ſet him forth; and
the King ſo ſoon as he had ſeen him, fell into Admiration of him,
ſo as he became confounded between his Admiration of <hi>Villiers</hi>
and the Pleaſure of the Play, which the King did not conceal,
but gave both Vent upon ſeveral Occaſions. This ſet the Heads
of the Courtiers at work how to get <hi>Somerſet</hi> out of Favour, and
to bring <hi>Villiers</hi> in; but here it's fit to look a little back, and ſee
the Occaſion <hi>Somerſet</hi> gave of <hi>Villiers</hi>'s Riſe, and of his own Fall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Somerſet</hi> was of mean and ſcarce known Parents, and as he was
endued with no natural Parts, ſo neither had he acquired any,
being brought up and bred a Page at Court; hereby he became as
little capable of demeaning himſelf in Proſperity as Adverſity. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi>'s Confinement he gave himſelf up wholly to
be govern'd by <hi>Northampton;</hi> and ſoon after his Marriage he fell
into an univerſal Solitarineſs and Sadneſs, ſo that it was much
taken notice of: which <hi>Northampton</hi> obſerving, and judging not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
that the Cares of <hi>Somerſet</hi> did ariſe from his Fears of the
Diſcovery of <hi>Overbury</hi>'s Death, wherein they were both deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
which if it ſhould come to paſs, they had no other means
to ſecure themſelves, but by making themſelves ſo great, as to
oppoſe all who ſhould charge them with it, or elſe by being Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
they might draw all that Party to aſſiſt them, and in theſe
they both agreed; and to make Matters more perplext, <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
by one <hi>Hamon</hi> did encourage the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to continue firm in their
Religion, aſſuring them that God would one way or other protect
his Church, and that now the greateſt Favourite in <hi>England</hi> would
ſtand firm to them, and alſo give Incouragement to the Papiſts in
the <hi>North</hi> to meet openly at Maſs, and foment the Feuds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots;</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> murmuring at the
King's Favours more to the <hi>Scots</hi> than them. If I have erred here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
the Writer of the hiſtorical Narration of the firſt fourteen Years
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60932:38"/>
of King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, <hi>cap.</hi> 30. led me into it. This ſullen
Humour of <hi>Somerſet</hi>'s little ſuted with the King's liking, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
better pleaſed with <hi>Somerſet</hi>'s Gaiety, in humouring him in all
his Pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Northampton</hi>'s Death, he was left alone to himſelf, and
all <hi>Northampton</hi>'s Deſigns died with him; and then <hi>Somerſet</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
forſaken all Men, and being forſaken by them, appeared in
his own Nature without any Diſguiſe, wretchedly penurious and
intolerably covetous: There was no coming at the King's Ear but
by him, nor any coming at him but by exceſſive Bribes; and as the
King began to loath him, ſo all Men deteſted and hated him: So
it was every Bodies buſineſs to out <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and bring young <hi>Villi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
into the King's Favour.</p>
                  <p>All the Court took notice of the King's Affection to young
<hi>Villiers,</hi> and the Queen obſerved it, and <hi>Villiers</hi> not to be wanting
to himſelf daily appeared at Court: There was but one Obſtacle
to be removed, and the Way was plain and eaſy for <hi>Villiers</hi> to be
the King's Favourite; the King would receive none into Favour,
but who was firſt recommended to him by the Queen, and the
Queen had obſerved ſomething in young <hi>Villiers</hi> which ſhe utterly
diſliked; and how to get the Queen to recommend young <hi>Villiers</hi> to
the King, was the only buſineſs to be done.</p>
                  <p>The Queen (a Princeſs of rare Piety, Prudence, Temperance
and Chaſtity) had a great Veneration for the Arch-Biſhop of
<hi>Canterbury Abbot,</hi> and the Arch-Biſhop as much an Averſion to
<hi>Somerſet,</hi> not only for his Marriage with the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex,</hi>
but for his other deteſtable Qualities; ſo that the Arch-Biſhop
was the only Inſtrument which was judged could move the
Queen to recommend young <hi>Villiers</hi> to the King.</p>
                  <p>It was no great difficulty to perſuade the Arch-Biſhop to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
this Buſineſs, being of himſelf diſpoſed to it; but when
he propounded it to the Queen, ſhe was utterly averſe from it,
having before been ſtung with Favourites; but by her Obſervation
of <hi>Villiers,</hi> ſhe told the Arch-Biſhop ſhe ſaw that in that young
<hi>Villiers,</hi> that if he became a Favourite, he would become more
intolerable than any that were before him.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Arch-Biſhop declined the Buſineſs, but <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi>
declining daily from bad to worſe, the Arch-Biſhop was again
prevailed upon to move the Queen to recommend young <hi>Villiers</hi>
to the King, which he did with more Importunity than before,
urging <hi>Somerſet</hi>'s intolerable Pride and Covetouſneſs, and that
he obſerved a good Nature and gentle Diſpoſition in <hi>Villi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi>
ſo that ſome Good might be hoped from him, which
could never be expected from the other: at laſt the Queen aſſented
to it, but withal told the Arch-Biſhop, he among the reſt would
live to repent it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:60932:39"/>
After <hi>Villiers</hi> was recommended by the Queen, it became out
of her Power, and the Power of the Kingdom to get him out of
the King's Favour, or his Son's after him, and the Arch-Biſhop
himſelf ſhall find the Queen to have been a true Propheteſs; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
at firſt <hi>Villiers</hi> acknowledg'd his Favour with the King to
have its Original from the Arch-Biſhop, called him Father, and
proteſted to be governed by him before all other Men; and the
Arch-Biſhop gave him ſome Leſſons to obſerve towards the King
and Queen, which <hi>Villiers</hi> repeated to him, and promiſed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
which you may read at large in the firſt part of Mr. <hi>Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>'s
Collections in the ſecond Year of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt
written by the Arch-Biſhop.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of Mr. <hi>Villiers</hi>'s coming into Favour he was
affable and courteous, and ſeemed to court all Men as they
courted him; he promoted Mens Suits to the King <hi>gratis,</hi> which
<hi>Somerſet</hi> would not do, but for great Sums of Money; and
hereby <hi>Villiers</hi> ſtole all the Hearts of the Courtiers and Petitioners
to the King from <hi>Somerſet,</hi> who was now wholly forſaken by God
and all Men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Somerſet</hi> thus forſaken of all Men, and ſtung in Conſcience for
the Death of <hi>Overbury,</hi> and finding a Rival in the King's Favour,
ſeeks by that ſmall Portion which he had left, to procure a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Pardon from the King to ſecure him in his Life and Eſtate,
(which was far the greateſt of any Subject in the King's Dominions)
and to that purpoſe applies himſelf to Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> to draw
one, as large and general as could be, which Sir <hi>Robert</hi> did, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the King ſhould declare, <hi>That of his own Motion, and ſpecial
Favour, he did pardon all, and all manner of Treaſons, Miſpriſions
of Treaſons, Murders, Felonies, and Outrages whatſoever, by the Earl
of</hi> Somerſet <hi>had been committed, or hereafter ſhould be committed;</hi> and
this Pardon the King ſigned.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Somerſet</hi> graſping at too much, loſt all, for my Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
<hi>Egerton</hi> refuſed to ſeal the Pardon: <hi>Somerſet</hi> asked him the
Reaſon, which the Chancellor told him was, becauſe if he did it,
he ſhould incur a <hi>Praemunire;</hi> and this the Chancellor told the King,
who was not diſpleaſed with it: So that now all Hopes of Pardon
for Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi>'s Murder failing, he had recourſe to other
Artifices, of ſuppreſſing all Letters which paſſed between him,
the Counteſs, and <hi>Northampton,</hi> either to Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> the Lieutenant,
or any of the Priſoners, and to make away <hi>Franklin</hi> the Apothecary,
who was fled into <hi>France,</hi> and had given Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> the Gliſter
which diſpatcht him; but that which <hi>Somerſet</hi> deſign'd for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
'twas thought, proved his Overthrow: but this was the
Product of next Year 1615, being the <hi>13th</hi> of the King.</p>
                  <p>Tho <hi>Villiers</hi> had the Aſcendant of the King's Favour far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending

Affections to him were more: and here it will not be amiſs to take

Son, and ſome others were in Sir</hi> Edward'<hi>s Lodging, but not in
Bed, when the Meſſenger about one in the Morning knockt at
the Door, where the Son met him, and knew him: Says he,</hi> I
come from the King, and muſt immediately ſpeak with your Father: If
you come from ten Kings, <hi>he anſwered,</hi> you ſhall not, for I know my
Father's Diſpoſition to be ſuch, that if he be diſturbed in his Sleep, he

he would wait upon him that Day.</p>
                  <p>The Meſſenger went back Poſt to <hi>Royſton,</hi> and arrived there about

caſt out of the King's Favour, the young Favourite <hi>Villiers,</hi> having
now no Competitor, roſe as faſt upon the Earl's Ruin as he fell;
and began to appear in his own Colours, from being Sir <hi>George,</hi>
and of the Bed-Chamber to the King, in the beginning of the
Month of <hi>January</hi> to be made Maſter of the Horſe; and upon the
Conviction of the Earl and Counteſs, the King ſeized upon the
huge Eſtate of the Earl, only allowing him 4000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi>

of <hi>Barnevelt</hi> and the <hi>States.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Barnevelt</hi> had his Eyes in every corner of the Court, he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the King was wholly intent upon his Pleaſures, exalting his

longer the King continued theſe Courſes, ſo much better might
the <hi>States</hi> make a Bargain with him about reſtoring their Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Towns, but not as Merchants, but Bankrupts. The Truce
between the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and them was above half expired, and if
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould keep their Towns till the War broke out again,
the King might impoſe what Terms he pleaſed upon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Barnevelt</hi> alſo obſerved the ill Terms which the King was upon

14 Months before, and impriſoning the Members for repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
the Subjects Grievances, which the King made worſe by a
Proclamation forbidding Men to talk of <hi>State-Affairs;</hi> and that he
doted upon, and was wholly governed by Viſcount <hi>Villiers,</hi> a raw
and unexperienced Gentleman in <hi>State-Affairs,</hi> ſcarce of Age:
Upon theſe Conſiderations <hi>Barnevelt</hi> adviſed the <hi>States</hi> not to pay
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in Gariſon in their Cautionary Towns, tho this was
expreſly contrary to the Agreement they made with Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
in 1598.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> debarred of their Pay, apply themſelves to the
King for Relief; the King was incenſed at the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and talked
high what he would do, but upon Repoſe he adviſed what to do:
the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Suffolk</hi> told him there was no Money in the
Exchequer, to call a Parliament would be a work of Time, and
in the mean while the Souldiers in Gariſon in the Cautionary
Towns muſt either ſtarve or revolt; beſides, the Wounds which
the impriſoned Members had were ſo green, that the Parliament
in all likelihood, would rather ſeek to cure them than ſupply the
King's Neceſſities; and ſtarve or revolt the Souldiers might, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the King would abate any thing of his Bounty to his
Favourites.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:60932:43"/>
Hereupon it was agreed, That the King ſhould enter into a Treaty
with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> concerning the Delivery of their Cautionary-Towns;
the <hi>Dutch</hi> expected it, and had given Orders to their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
here (called the Lord <hi>Caroon)</hi> to treat about it, and what
they would give, the King muſt take; and <hi>Caroon</hi>'s Inſtructions were
to give two hundred and forty eight thouſand Pounds in full Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the whole Debt, which was ſcarce Twelve Pence in the
Pound, but was greedily accepted of by the King and his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.
But how well this Agreement did ſort with the Treaty made
with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and Arch-Dukes in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1604, where in
the <hi>7th</hi> Article the King ſwears and promiſes in the Word of a King,
<hi>That in a competent time he would aſſign a Treaty with the</hi> Dutch
States, <hi>to acccept and receive Conditions agreeable to Juſtice and
Equity, for a Pacification to be had with the renowned Princes his
dear Brethren; which if the</hi> States <hi>ſhall ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſe to accept, his Majeſty
from thenceforward, as being freed from former Conventions, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
of thoſe Towns according as he ſhall judg it to be Juſt and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
wherein the ſaid Princes, his loving Brethren, ſhall find there
ſhall be no want of theſe good Offices, which can be expected from a
friendly Prince;</hi> let the World judg.</p>
                  <p>Tho the Bargain were agreed, yet the King and Courtiers were
in fear the Money ſhould not be paid accordingly, and therefore
the King wrote to the <hi>States</hi> in a Stile far differing from that he
uſed to the Parliament; for, ſays my Author, <hi>William de Britain,
fol.</hi> 12. the King told them, <hi>He knew the</hi> States <hi>of</hi> Holland <hi>to be
his good Friends and Confederates, both in Point of Religion and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy</hi>
(one as true as the other, for the Religion of the <hi>Dutch</hi> was
<hi>Presbytery,</hi> which the King hated, nor did he ever imitate their
Policy) <hi>therefore he apprehended not the leaſt fear of Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them: In Contemplation whereof, if they would have their
Towns again, he would willingly ſurrender them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So tho the <hi>Dutch</hi> got their Towns again, yet the King got not
all the Money, for my Lord Treaſurer <hi>Suffolk</hi> kept back ſo much
of it, as he was fined 30000 <hi>l.</hi> in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> for it, and
had not ſcaped ſo, if Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> then Lord Chancellor, had
not been his Friend.</p>
                  <p>After the Sale of the Towns was agreed on, the next Debate
was, What ſhould become of the Souldiers in Gariſon? But let
them look to that, for the King being <hi>Rex Pacificus,</hi> had no need of

                  <p>The diſhonourable Delivery of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Towns, made no Allay
in his Affections to his new Favourite, tho wholly unacquainted
with <hi>State-Affairs,</hi> who was as much given up to the Pleaſures of
<hi>Venus,</hi> as the King was to thoſe of <hi>Bacchus;</hi> neither the Sale of
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Towns, nor the ſeizing <hi>Somerſet</hi>'s Eſtate, would anſwer
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60932:44"/>
the Expence of his Pleaſures and Bounty, the diſpoſing of all
Places and Offices Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, all waved as he nodded;
and herein his Venality was as profuſe as his Venery.</p>
                  <p>One of the firſt that felt the Effects of his Power herein, was
Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> who at this time ſat very looſe and uneaſy; he
had highly diſguſted the Court and high-Church-Party, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Arch-biſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi>'s Articles againſt granting <hi>Prohibitions</hi> at
<hi>Common-Law.</hi> He oppoſed my Lord Chancellor <hi>Egerton</hi> taking
notice of a Cauſe in the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> after Judgment given, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Act 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 23. and refuſed to give any Opinion
in the Caſe of <hi>Commendums,</hi> being a Judg, before it came judicial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before him: And however my Lord Chancellor <hi>Egerton,</hi> upon
the ſwearing Sir <hi>Henry Mountague,</hi> when he ſucceeded Sir <hi>Edward
Coke</hi> in the Office of Chief Juſtice, declared Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
was for being ſo popular; yet I have it from one of Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s
Sons, that the Cauſe of his Removal was,</p>
                  <p>That Sir <hi>Nicholas Tufton</hi> being very aged, and having a Patent
for Life of the <hi>Green-wax-Office</hi> in the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> the Viſcount
<hi>Villiers</hi> by his Agents dealt with Sir <hi>Nicholas,</hi> that if he would
ſurrender his Patent, the King would make him Earl of <hi>Thanet;</hi>
and in the mean time Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> treated with Sir <hi>Edward,</hi>
to know whether in caſe Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> ſurrendred his Patent, the
Viſcount ſhould prefer another to the Office; Sir <hi>Edward</hi> would
give Sir <hi>Francis</hi> no other Anſwer than this, <hi>That he was old, and
could not wreſtle with my Lord.</hi> However, after Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> had
ſurrendred, Sir <hi>Edward</hi> refuſed to admit of a Clerk by <hi>Villiers</hi>'s
Nomination, but ſtood upon his Right; and that the Judges of
the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> ſerved the King to their Loſs, and therefore he
would ſo diſpoſe of the Office, that the other Judges of the
<hi>King's-Bench</hi>'s Salaries ſhould be advanced; and that hereupon he
was turned out of his Place, and Sir <hi>Henry Mountague</hi> put in, who
diſpoſed the Office as the Favourite pleaſed. But tho the Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite's
Diſpleaſure began here with Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> it did not end ſo,
nor the Titles of our new Favourite, for upon the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>January</hi>
following he was created Earl of <hi>Buckingham;</hi> however Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
might have been reſtored again to the place of Chief Juſtice,
if he would have given a Bribe, but he anſwered, <hi>A Judg ought
not to take a Bribe, nor give a Bribe.</hi> See the ſecond Part of the
Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s Life, <hi>fol. 120. Tit.</hi> 116.</p>
                  <p>We begin this Year 1617, (after the King had created the Earl
Marqueſs of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> on the firſt of <hi>January)</hi> with the Story of
Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>'s Voyage to <hi>Guiana,</hi> which was the Cauſe of his
Death, tho upon another ſcore, being condemned in the firſt Year
of the King for High-Treaſon in <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Conſpiracy, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to have hindered the King's coming to the Crown: But
before we proceed we'll ſtay a little and take a view of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:60932:44"/>
Sir <hi>Walter</hi> was of an antient Family, but a younger Brother;
and as he was a Perſon of admirable Parts, excellently adorned
with Learning, not Pedantick, but of a nobler Strain, ſo he had a
Mind far above his Fortune, and accounted Poverty the greateſt
of Misfortunes; and to advance his Fortune he became a Courtier
to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who was as great a Diſcerner of Men, and
their Qualities, as any Prince in her time, or perhaps before or
ſince; and as ſuch, and not as impoſed by Favourites, ſhe eſteemed
and preferred them; and upon this account ſhe entertained and
favoured Sir <hi>Walter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Queen made him Captain of her Guards, Lieutenant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and Lord Warden of the <hi>Stanneries:</hi> but theſe
were rather Honorary Titles, than much profitable; and being at
Enmity with the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> (the Queen's greateſt Favourite)
and the whole Family of the <hi>Cecils,</hi> (who governed all in State-Affairs)
theſe put a full ſtop to Sir <hi>Walter</hi>'s further Riſe at Court.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Walter</hi> thus balk'd at Court, ſeeks Adventures abroad to
raiſe his Fortunes thence; and the Wars continuing between the
Queen and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the Year 1595, he mans out a
Ship to <hi>Guiana</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and by the Intelligence which
he had with ſome of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Priſoners he
had taken, believed he had made a Diſcovery of ſeveral rich
Mines, and had certain Marks whereby to diſcover them again, if
occaſion ſhould happen.</p>
                  <p>But if he got nothing elſe by his Voyage, he got this Advantage
by it, that adding Experience to his excellent Theory in Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he juſtly merited the Applauſe of the beſt Director of Sea-Affairs
of his time.</p>
                  <p>After Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Death, he was kept 12 Years a Priſoner
in the Tower, where he compiled his Hiſtory of the World, a
Deſign ſo vaſt, that no other Man of leſs Parts both of Body and
Mind could have accompliſhed: And while he was thus confined,
he was the firſt which made publick the Growth by Sea of the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> and the Riches they derived by their fiſhing upon the
Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Conſequences which would
neceſſarily follow, not only to the loſs of the King's Soveraignty
of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas, but to the Trade and Navigation of <hi>England</hi>
otherwiſe. After that, one <hi>Tobias Gentleman</hi> ſet forth another
Treatiſe of this Nature, and how this Fiſhery might be carried
on from the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> and dedicated it to the King; but
the King wholly giving himſelf up to Pleaſure, neither minded
the one, nor regarded the other.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Walter</hi> had been diſcharged out of the Tower about two
Years and an half before, but by what means I do not find, and
then Poverty ſtared him in the Face (for <hi>Somerſet</hi> had begg'd
his Eſtate) which to him was more intolerable than his Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60932:45"/>
and how to extricate himſelf out of it was all his Buſineſs:
There was a new face of Court to what was in Queen <hi>Elizabeth'</hi>
days, and Sir <hi>Walter</hi> unknown to any of them. His being freed
out of Priſon was ſuch a Favour as any further was not to be
hoped for: Happy had Sir <hi>Walter</hi> been if he had been ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined,
where in the reſtraint of his Perſon he enlarged the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his Mind to nobler Pleaſures than can be found in Senſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or any Temporal Greatneſs; where by his Freedom purſuing
theſe, beſides other concomitant Calamities, he brought De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
upon himſelf, having firſt ſeen his Son <hi>Walter</hi> ſlain in
the Deſign he intended to raiſe his Fortunes by.</p>
                  <p>Tho the King was never poorer than at this time, yet the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was far richer than in all the long Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
by reaſon of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade with <hi>Spain</hi> made free by that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Law of the <hi>3d</hi> of the King, <hi>cap.</hi> 6. and at this time, and
many Years before, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> made Count <hi>Gundamor</hi> his

                  <p>In this Poſture of Affairs Sir <hi>Walter</hi> informs the King, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

he would grant him a Commiſſion, he would bring Mountains of

                  </p>
                  <p>But this Commiſſion ill agreed with the Treaty made between
the King and the moſt renowned King of <hi>Spain,</hi> his dear and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Brother, in the ſecond Year of his Reign, wherein in the firſt
Article it was agreed, That they ſhould uſe one another with all
kind and friendly Offices; and by this Treaty the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were

account of it; and this became ſo much the more publick, by
how much the King could not contribute any thing but his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
towards it: and tho Sir <hi>Walter</hi>'s Fame induced many No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and Gentlemen to join with him in it, yet this being diſtracted
and divided into ſo many Intereſts, it went on more heavily, and
became every day more known; ſo that tho Sir <hi>Walter</hi> intended to
have proceeded on his Voyage this Year in the beginning of <hi>April,</hi>
it was upward in <hi>Auguſt</hi> before he ſet out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:60932:45"/>
In his Paſſage a terrible Fever overtook Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> now in the
<hi>76th</hi> Year of his Age, which yet the Strength of his Conſtitution
overcame, to bring him to his End by a worſe Fate: When he
arrived at <hi>Guiana,</hi> he found all the Marks which he and Sir <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas
Kemiſh</hi> had made, either worn out by Time, being twenty
Years before, or alter'd by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had ſo long before
had notice of his Deſign; ſo that <hi>Kemiſh</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter</hi> fell at
ſuch odds about it, that <hi>Kemiſh</hi> killed himſelf; beſides, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
to prevent <hi>Raleigh</hi>'s Deſign, had built many new Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
unknown to <hi>Raleigh</hi> or <hi>Kemiſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereupon Sir <hi>Walter</hi> ſtormed the Town of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> wherein
he loſt his Son <hi>Walter,</hi> but took the Town and ſack'd it; and here
the Souldiers took great Spoil, but with little Profit to Sir <hi>Walter,</hi>
or any of the Adventurers with him: For the Souldiers and Sea-men,
being Reformades, and being under no ſevere Diſcipline, kept
what they had got.</p>
                  <p>Now was Sir <hi>Walter</hi> in a moſt deſperate State, he had no Friends
at Court, and, which made the matter worſe, he had diſguſted
all the Nobles and Gentlemen who had engag'd with him in this
Expedition: he need not conſult the Augurs what ſhould be his
Fate upon his Return, to prevent which he endeavoured to have
got into <hi>France,</hi> and carry his Ship with him; but the Sea-men,
who now had his Fortune in Contempt, would not forſake their
Wives and Children, to partake with him in his Misfortunes, and
ſo brought him back again into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was reſolved that Sir <hi>Walter</hi>'s Misfortunes ſhould loſe him his
Head, but how to do it with a face of Juſtice was the Queſtion;
for his Commiſſion protected him from any Proſecution for the
ſacking of St. <hi>Thomas;</hi> and it would ſeem ſtrange to execute him
upon the Conviction in <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Conſpiracy ſixteen Years before,
eſpecially ſince the King had diſcharged his Impriſoment upon it,
and had granted him a Commiſſion, wherein he called Sir <hi>Walter</hi>
his beloved and faithful Sir <hi>Walter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However this was the beſt Face could be put upon it, and upon
the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> next Year 1618, Sir <hi>Walter</hi> was brought from
the <hi>Tower</hi> to the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> to ſhew Cauſe why Sentence of
Death ſhould not paſs upon him, <hi>Mountague</hi> being Chief Juſtice,
upon his former Conviction: to which Sir <hi>Walter</hi> pleaded his
Commiſſion, which pardoned his Crime; <hi>For he could not be a
Traitor and the King's beloved and faithful Servant at one and the
ſame time:</hi> but this was over-ruled by the Court, which anſwered,
<hi>That Treaſon could not be pardoned by Implication, but by expreſs
words:</hi> And next day he had his Head cut off in the <hi>Palace-Yard</hi>
at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In granting Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> this Commiſſion, you may ſee by
what an undiſtinguiſhed Power <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> governs the Actions of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60932:46"/>
Princes, as well as meaner Men, againſt their Honour and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt;
for at the ſame time when the King granted this Commiſſion,
he was by Sir <hi>John Digby</hi> (after Earl of <hi>Briſtol)</hi> treating a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
between Prince <hi>Charles</hi> and the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> upon the
Terms of a Portion of two Millions of Money with her: but if this
Act of <hi>Raleigh</hi>'s, and the difficulty of raiſing ſuch a Portion, put
no ſtop to the Progreſs of it, you'll ſoon ſee an Accident which
ſhall make it utterly impracticable with the Maxims and Policy of
<hi>Spain;</hi> yet ſo far was the King blinded with the Covetouſneſs of
getting the Portion, that he ſhall put his only Son into the Power
of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to obtain it.</p>
                  <p>Tho young <hi>Villiers</hi> and the King's Favourites governed the King
without any Controul by the <hi>Engliſh, Conchino Conchini</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi>
Marqueſs <hi>d' Ancre</hi> and Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> and his Wife ſucceeded
not ſo well in <hi>France;</hi> for after the Death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of
<hi>France,</hi> theſe two governed <hi>Mary d' Medicis, Henry</hi>'s Relict and
Regent, as abſolutely as our young Favourite did the King, which
put the Princes of the Blood and Nobility into ſuch a Ferment,
that they ſeveral times roſe in Tumults and Arms againſt them:
Yet ſuch was their Power with the Queen, that they continued as
inſolent after the King was declared of Majority as before, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Feuds of the Princes of the Blood and Nobility grew
higher; hereupon <hi>Luynes,</hi> the King's Favourite, prompted the
King to take off <hi>Ancre</hi> any way, which was ſo ordered, that <hi>Ancre</hi>
coming into the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and reading a Letter, <hi>Vitry,</hi> Captain of
the King's Guard, arreſted him: <hi>Me?</hi> ſaid <hi>Ancre; Yes you, by the
Death of God,</hi> anſwered <hi>Vitry,</hi> who cried out, <hi>Kill him!</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he was killed by three Piſtol Shots, the King owning the
Fact. But <hi>Ancre</hi>'s Fate did not end with his Life, for the next
day after he was buried, the Lacquies of the Court, and Rabble of
the City digged up his Coffin, tore his Winding-Sheet, and dragged
his Body through the Gutters, and hanged it upon the Gibbet he
had prepared for others, where they cut off his Noſe, Ears and
Genitors, which they ſent to the Duke of <hi>Main,</hi> Head of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
League (the great Favourite of the <hi>Pariſians)</hi> and nailed
his Ears to the Gates of <hi>Paris,</hi> and burned the reſt of his Body,
and hurled part of the Aſhes into the River, and part into the Air;
and his Wife ſoon after was condemned by the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi>
for a Witch, for which ſhe was beheaded.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1618, a Blazon Comet appeared, and the Marqueſs
of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> by the removal of my Lord Admiral <hi>Nottingham</hi>
(who was ſo in the famous Overthrow of the <hi>Spaniſh Armado</hi> in
1588.) was made Lord Admiral, being as well qualified for that
Office, as he was for being Prime Miniſter in <hi>State-Affairs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was no wonder that <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII<hi>th,</hi> after the Death of the
Marqueſs <hi>d' Ancre</hi> and his Wife, ſhould remove his Mother from
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60932:46"/>
State-Affairs and confine her to <hi>Blois,</hi> to make room for <hi>Luynes,</hi>
to govern him more abſolutely than the Marqueſs and his Wife
had done his Mother; for <hi>Lewis</hi> as he was of a feeble Conſtitution
both of Body and Mind, ſo <hi>Luynes</hi> was a kind of Governor to
him, appointed ſo by his Father <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> to humour him in
all his Childiſh Toys and Pleaſures: So tho <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> when forty
Years old, was governed by young Men, not in Years but Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
ſo neither was it any great wonder, that <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi>
a young Man, ſhould be governed by <hi>Pierce Gaveſton,</hi> a Perſon of
far more accompliſhed Parts than <hi>Buckingham,</hi> for <hi>Gaveſton</hi> was
bred up with <hi>Edward,</hi> and had ſo far by his Flatteries prevailed
upon him, that <hi>Edward</hi> could not enjoy any Pleaſure in his Life
without him. But for an old King, having been ſo for above fifty
one Years, to dote ſo upon a young Favourite, ſcarce of Age, yet
younger in Underſtanding, tho as old in Vices as any in his time,
and to commit the whole Ship of the Common-wealth both by
Sea and Land to ſuch a <hi>Phaeton,</hi> is a Precedent without any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But how much ſoever the Safety of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nation was
endangered hereby, yet the but mentioning any thing hereof was
an Invaſion of the King's Prerogative, and meddling with State-Affairs,
which was above the Capacity of the Vulgar, and even of
the Parliament, as you will ſoon hear. But how abſolute ſoever
the King was at Home, the face of Affairs Abroad ſtood quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
for the</hi> Dutch <hi>having retrieved their Cautionary Towns out
of his Poſſeſſion, had the King in ſuch Contempt, that they neither
regarded him, nor his new Lord High Admiral; and this Year,
ſays the Author of the Addreſs to the Free-men and Free-holders
of the Nation, in his ſecond</hi> Preface, <hi>f.</hi> 13, 14. The <hi>Dutch</hi> never
before fiſhed upon the Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> till they had begged leave of
the King or Governour of <hi>Scarborough Caſtle;</hi> but this was now
thought beneath the Magnificence of the <hi>Hogan Mogans,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they refuſed it. They had been formerly limited by our Kings,
both for the Number of their Veſſels they ſhould fiſh with, and the
time: Now they reſolve to be their own Carvers, and in order to that,
denied the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the Sovereignty of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas; and as if
this had not been enough, drew nearer and nearer upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Shores Year by Year than they did in preceding Times, without leaving
any Bounds for the Country-People or Natives to fiſh upon their Princes
Coaſts; and oppreſſed ſome of his Subjects, with intent to continue
their pretended Poſſeſſion, and had driven ſome of their great Veſſels
through their Nets, to deter others by like Violence from fiſhing near
them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Secretary <hi>Nanton, January</hi> 21, 1618. told <hi>Carleton,</hi>
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſador: And to juſtify all this, they ſet out Men of
War with their Fiſhermen to maintain all this by Force. <hi>But it was
not Fiſh our new Lord Admiral cared for; nor did he care for the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60932:47"/>
King's Soveraignty of the</hi> Britiſh Seas, <hi>ſo as he might be Lord
High Admiral in Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sails of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Ambition were not full ſwelled, till
to the Title of Lord High Admiral, the Lord Warden of the
Cinque-Ports was added to it, tho he regarded the guarding the
Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> as little as he did the Soveraignty of the <hi>Britiſh
Seas:</hi> Nor did the accumulated Honours to himſelf alone ſatisfy
his Ambition, but a new Strain, his Mother, tho a profeſſed Papiſt,
muſt be pullied up with him in a concurring Title of the ſame
Honour, by being created Counteſs of <hi>Buckingham. And being

looked more after Pleaſure than Profit) which made</hi> Gundamor

at leaſt of his Troubles: But this no way troubled our young
Favourite, but to encreaſe the Honour of his Family by Sir <hi>George</hi>'s
ſecond Brood, in <hi>June</hi> following he had his eldeſt Brother <hi>John</hi>
created Baron <hi>Stroke,</hi> and Viſcount <hi>Purbeck,</hi> tho I do not find he
ever gave him one Penny to maintain theſe Titles.</p>
                  <p>Such diſguſt the King had taken at the Commons repreſenting
the Grievances to him in the laſt Parliament, that in his Cups, and
among his Familiars upon all Occaſions, he would inveigh againſt
Parliaments, ſaying, <hi>God is my Judg, I can have no Joy of any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in</hi> England; <hi>and that he was but one King, and there were
alove five hundred in the Houſe of Commons:</hi> So as if he could
have helped it, he never would have been troubled with another:
but as the Marriage of his Daughter with the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi>
was the cauſe of his calling the laſt Parliament, ſo the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60932:47"/>
of this Marriage put him upon the neceſſity of calling
another.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth, Franklin,</hi> and all other our Writers

                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hungary,</hi> at the Death of <hi>Lewis,</hi> from the time when <hi>Matthias</hi>
(the Son of the famous <hi>Huniades)</hi> began to reign over them, for
70 Years enjoyed perfect Peace within, and abroad had the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the moſt Warlike Nation, and of all other the beſt
Frontier, to ſtop the further Rage of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Arms in <hi>Europe:</hi>
But in this long Peace, the People, eſpecially the Clergy, became
exceſſive rich, accompanied with intolerable Pride, and all other
Vices which accompany Luxury and Eaſe.</p>
                  <p>In this high Conceit of themſelves, the Clergy (eſpecially <hi>Tome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius)</hi>
put the King with an Army of 25000 Men only, to fight with
<hi>Solyman</hi> with 300000 <hi>Turks,</hi> twelve to one, wherein not only the
King, but alſo <hi>Tomerius,</hi> and the Flower of all the Nobility of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi>
fell; here the Fate of <hi>Hungary</hi> began, but did not end here.</p>

For <hi>Ferdinand</hi> having married <hi>Lewis</hi> his Siſter, and aſſiſted by

Vaivod</hi> of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> to be their King; and <hi>John</hi> being too
weak to oppoſe <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> flies to <hi>Solyman</hi> for his Aſſiſtance; ſo
that <hi>Hungary,</hi> which before was the Barrier againſt the Progreſs of
the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Power in <hi>Europe,</hi> now opens her Gates to let it in:
however the <hi>Turk</hi> being engaged in Wars againſt the <hi>Perſians,
Ferdinand</hi> prevailed againſt both, and <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> came to
this Agreement, That <hi>John</hi> ſhould enjoy that part of <hi>Hungary</hi>
whereof he was poſſeſt during Life, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the whole after
his Death.</p>
                  <p>Soon after <hi>John</hi> died, leaving the Queen with Child, which

now chuſe the Son, and joining with the Queen, call in <hi>Solyman</hi>

the Title of <hi>Vaivod</hi> of <hi>Tranſilvania:</hi> Now was <hi>Hungary</hi> become the
Theatre for above 150 Years of all thoſe Calamities which both
Civil and Foreign Wars bring upon a Country; ſo that of the moſt
fruitful and beſt inhabited Kingdom in <hi>Europe,</hi> it became the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate
and uninhabited, the Inhabitants being made uſe of only to
be Slaves either to imperious Souldiers, or lazy and idle Clergy-men.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Hungary</hi> were the Paradiſe of the World, <hi>Bohemia</hi> was not leſs

in right of his Wife; and being aſſiſted by his Brother <hi>Charles,</hi> and
further from the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Turks,</hi> he forced the <hi>Bohemians</hi> to
ſubmit to his Empire; but this was not only during his and his
Wife's Life, and her Heirs, but to his Heirs Male, tho he claimed in
right of his Wife. And herein you muſt obſerve, That the <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi>
at this time, as well as their Anceſtors before, were Enemies
to the Popiſh Tyranny and Hereſies, ſo that <hi>Ziſca,</hi> the famous

                  <p>
                     <hi>Matthias</hi> had a Counſellor named <hi>Gleſelius,</hi> upon whoſe Advice
and Integrity <hi>Matthias</hi> relied above all other Men, who adviſed
<hi>Matthias</hi> by all fair means poſſible to compoſe the Commotions of

was ſuch, not only in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Councils, but the Popiſh

as he had done the Crown of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> and <hi>Matthias</hi> feeling yet

his Authority in the tendereſt part, and now without any Council,
left in the Hands of his Couſin, who deſigned to riſe out of his
Ruin, became ſo overwhelmed with Melancholy, that both aſleep

no purpoſe, for he ſhall never live to ſee him again; and in theſe
Agonies he had ſome thoughts to have caſt himſelf into the Arms
of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> but it was not in his Power to do it. Theſe
things were in 1618, at the end whereof <hi>Matthias</hi> died.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Commotions in <hi>Bohemia</hi> and other parts of the Empire,
encreaſed after the Death of <hi>Matthias,</hi> ſo that the Election of an
Emperor was controverted till the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1619, when
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> was choſen, having by large Promiſes prevailed upon
<hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> to vote for him.</p>
                  <p>But however, the <hi>Bohemians</hi> were ſtiff in oppoſing his Election
to the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and offered the Crown to <hi>Charles,</hi>
Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> tho a Popiſh Prince, and who had a better Title
to the Crown of <hi>Bohemia</hi> than <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> his Mother being a
younger Daughter of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> but prevailed upon by
the Pope and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Councils, he refuſed it, as did the Duke of
<hi>Saxony;</hi> and then they choſe <hi>Frederick</hi> Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> hoping to
receive great Aſſiſtance from King <hi>James</hi> his Father-in-law, but
were miſtaken in the Man.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Election <hi>Abbot</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was all on
Fire, to perſwade the King to aſſiſt his Son-in-law, and to that
purpoſe wrote a long perſwaſive Apology to the King concerning
it, which you may read at large in <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>'s Collections, <hi>fol.</hi> 12.
but the King and Biſhop were not of the ſame Opinion; for the
King would have it, that the Election of his Son-in-law was upon
the Score of Religion, not Right, and therefore diſſwaded him
from it; but being a mighty Man of Embaſſies, as well as Words,
<hi>Nani</hi> ſays <hi>fol.</hi> 138. publiſhed, that he would aſſiſt his Son-in-law,
and diſpatched an Ambaſſador to <hi>Vienna,</hi> propoſing that <hi>Bohemia</hi>

not ſettle his Son-in-law, King <hi>James</hi> could not go further. <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
thus forſaken by his Father-in-law, raiſed upon his own
account 10000 Foot and 2000 Horſe, and entred <hi>Prague;</hi> and
was crown'd King on the Fourth of <hi>November</hi> 1619, and was no
ſooner crown'd, but laid the Foundation of his own Ruine: for the
Counts <hi>De la Tour</hi> and <hi>Mansfield,</hi> who had raiſed two Armies and
kept up the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> till the King's coming to <hi>Prague,</hi> were not
only neglected, but the Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> whom the King brought
with him, was made not only Generaliſſimo of the Army the King
brought, but of the Armies raiſed by <hi>de la Tour</hi> and <hi>Mansfield;</hi>
beſides, the King, tho he had got a vaſt Treaſure, was niggardly in

Count <hi>Spinola,</hi> General of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, under the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60932:50"/>
Arch-Duke <hi>Albert</hi> (whom the King in the Treaty of the <hi>2d</hi> Year
of his Reign calls <hi>His renowned and dear Brother)</hi> made terrible
Wars in the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here you may ſee how unhappy King <hi>James</hi> was in the Peace or
Truce he procured the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Arch-Dukes to
make with the <hi>Dutch</hi> in 1609, for twelve Years; for in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval,
the <hi>Dutch</hi> did not only retrieve their Cautionary Towns
out of the King's Poſſeſſion, but the Truce ſtill continuing, the
Arch-Duke had not only an Opportunity to aſſiſt the Emperor,
but to ſend <hi>Spinola</hi> with an Army to invade the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> and
the Emperor by an imperial Ban, had proſcribed the King's Son-in-law
a Traitor and Rebel to the Empire, and thereupon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
his Electoral Dignity and Eſtate, which he gave to <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian,</hi>
Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and committed the Execution of it to
the Arch-Duke <hi>Albert,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>King <hi>James</hi> was ſtartled at this Return to his Propoſition at
<hi>Vienna,</hi> that his Son-in-law ſhall poſſeſs the Crown of <hi>Bohemia;</hi>
and now complains that his Childrens Patrimony would be loſt, and
that he would not ſit ſtill, and take no further Care in it, and
therefore ſent another Ambaſſadour to the Arch-Duke at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi>
to expoſtulate the matter; and this was the utmoſt he was able to do,
and was forced to ſtrain his Credit for it: but leſt this ſhould not
do, tho ſore againſt his Will, he reſolved to call another Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and try their <hi>Good Will</hi> towards it.</p>
                  <p>But that we may take all things before us, as they ſtood at the
Meeting of this Parliament, the King notwithſtanding the Attempt
of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> upon the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt-Indies,</hi> had ſtill by
Sir <hi>John Digby</hi> continued the Treaty of Marriage between the
Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the <hi>Infanta Maria</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> with the ſame
Confidence of Succeſs, as if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in Sir <hi>Walter</hi>'s Expedition: But the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> to
check the King's forward Deſires, demand high Privileges for the
<hi>Romaniſts,</hi> which amounted to little leſs than a <hi>Toleration;</hi> and
that the Pope muſt be ſatisfied in his Conſcience, before he could
grant a <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> for the <hi>Infanta</hi> to marry with an Heretick
Prince; both which the King and Prince agreed to, and were
ſigned by them both, though afterwards.</p>
                  <p>But however the Agreement between the Pope, King and Prince
was not much known, the Liberty granted to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks
was generally taken notice of; and beſide, the Generality of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
notwithſtanding the Benefits received by the <hi>Spaniſh Trade,</hi> ſtill
retained an Averſion to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which made the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match
hated and feared by them; and how much more they hated and
feared the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſo much more zealous were they for the
King's Aſſiſtance of his Son-in-law in his Title to the Kingdom of
<hi>Bohemia,</hi> as well as in the Preſervation of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
by the Emperor and King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:60932:50"/>
Thus things ſtood when the King's Neceſſities forced him to the
unwilling Reſolution of calling another Parliament: but they did
not ſtay here, for upon the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> happened the fatal
Battel at <hi>Prague,</hi> fought by above 60000 Combatants, wherein,
tho the <hi>Bohemians</hi> were ſuperior in Number, the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> were
in Diſcipline and Valour; and tho the King was the principal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the War, yet he thought not fit to engage in the Battel,
but ſtood at a diſtance out of Harm's way to obſerve the Event
of it.</p>
                  <p>After two hours Fight, the <hi>Bohemians</hi> were utterly overthrown
and routed, 6000 being killed, and more taken Priſoners, with
all their Colours, Baggage, Guns and Ammunition, and ſcarce 300
of the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> killed; the Prince of <hi>Anhalt</hi> was the firſt who
gave the King notice of his Overthrow, with Advice to provide
for his Safety, which the King thought to do by flying back into
<hi>Prague,</hi> but found no Safety there.</p>
                  <p>For the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> General of the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> followed
him cloſe, and ſummons him to ſurrender the City, and quit his
Claim to the Kingdom: The King demands 24 Hours reſpite to
anſwer, but <hi>Bavaria</hi> only grants him 8, to which without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
next Morning the King, with the Queen, big with Child, and
their Children fly out of <hi>Prague,</hi> and by unfrequent Ways, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
a Miracle, eſcape to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ratiſlavia,</hi> leaving the Heads of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in <hi>Prague</hi> to be Victims, after an horrible Sacrifice, to their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
and bloody Enemies, and all that ineſtimable Wealth, which
he had got together, and was ſo niggardly of to his Souldiers, to be
a Prey to his Enemies alſo.</p>
                  <p>In this diſaſterous State, <hi>Frederick</hi> driven out of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the
<hi>Palatinate</hi> invaded and overrun by <hi>Spinola,</hi> and having loſt all his
Wealth, as well as Kingdom and Country, retires with his Wife
and Children into <hi>Holland;</hi> more ſupported by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, and Arch-Biſhop
<hi>Abbot,</hi> than by the King, whoſe Bounty lay another way; and
ſince he could not obtain Aids from his Father-in-law for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of his Country, yet he became a Suitor to the King to
ſolicite the <hi>Imperial</hi> Court for the Conſervation of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi>
which the King did, but did him no good, and further the King
would not go; but vainly promiſed to himſelf he could do it, by
the Marriage of his Son to the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and get two
Millions of Money for her Portion to boot.</p>
                  <p>Though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility patiently truckled under the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and Covetouſneſs of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> yet the ſame <hi>Genius</hi> was
not found in the <hi>French</hi> Princes of the Blood, and Nobility, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the prodigious Pride, and exorbitant Promotions of <hi>Luynes:</hi>
to reſtrain them, or it may be, to force <hi>Luynes</hi> from the King's
Favour, the Queen-Mother made a League with the Count of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60932:51"/>
                     <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> (a Prince of the Blood) the Count <hi>Vendoſm</hi> and Grand
Prior of <hi>France,</hi> (both natural Sons of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>France)</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But theſe Commotions, being ſudden and ungrounded, were
ſoon ſuppreſt, and the King was reconciled to the Queen and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh

had upon the <hi>Loire,</hi> and alſo <hi>Suilly, Merac</hi> and <hi>Caumont.</hi> King
<hi>James,</hi> that he might as much appear for the <hi>Reformed,</hi> as he had
done for his Son-in-law, ſent Sir <hi>Edward Herbert,</hi> after Baron
<hi>Herbert</hi> of <hi>Cherberry,</hi> his Ambaſſadour into <hi>France,</hi> to mediate a
Peace between the King and the <hi>Reformed,</hi> and in Caſe of Refuſal,
to uſe Menaces, which Sir <hi>Edward</hi> bravely performed, to <hi>Luynes,</hi>
and after to the <hi>French</hi> King himſelf; which being miſrepreſented
to King <hi>James,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward</hi> was recalled, and the Earl of <hi>Carliſle</hi>
was ſent Ambaſſadour into <hi>France</hi> in his room; and the Earl find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Truth to be otherwiſe than was repreſented by <hi>Luynes,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
the King with it: Hereupon Sir <hi>Edward</hi> kneeled to the
King, and humbly beſought him, that ſince the Buſineſs between
<hi>Luynes</hi> and him was become publick, that a Trumpeter, if not an
Herald on Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s Part might be ſent to <hi>Luynes,</hi> to tell him,
<hi>That he had made a falſe Relation to the King of the Paſſages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them; and that Sir</hi> Edward <hi>would demand Reaſons of him
with Sword in Hand on that Point:</hi> but the King was not pleaſed
to grant it; and here began the Downfal of the Power of the
<hi>Reformed</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and the Riſe of the <hi>French</hi> Grandeur by Land.</p>
                  <p>In this rotten and teachy State of Affairs, before the Meeting
of the Parliament, the King iſſued out a Proclamation, (of which
he was as prodigal, as bountiful to his Favourites) forbidding Men
to talk of <hi>State-Affairs</hi> (as if his Favourite <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who
governed all, was ſo mindful of them;) nor was the King leſs jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of the Parliament's meddling with <hi>State-Affairs,</hi> than of the
Peoples talking of them out of Parliament, ſo that the King upon
the opening of the Parliament the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> told them of
the Conſtituting Parts of a Parliament, and how it was twelve
Years ſince he had received any Aids from Parliaments; and how
that though he had proſecuted a Treaty of Marriage between the
Prince and <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> which if it were not for the Benefit
of the Eſtabliſhed Religion in <hi>England,</hi> and of the <hi>Reformed</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
he was not worthy to be their King; and though he had
refuſed to aſſiſt his Son-in-law in his Election to the Kingdom of
<hi>Bohemia,</hi> being a matter of Religion contrary to what he had
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60932:51"/>
wrote againſt the Jeſuits, yet that he could not ſit ſtill, and ſee the
Patrimony of his Children torn from them by the Emperor, and
therefore was reſolved to raiſe an Army next Summer; and that
he would engage his Crown, his Blood and Soul for the Recovery
of the <hi>Palatinate:</hi> And having before told the Commons of their
Duty to petition the King, and acquaint him with their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
but not to meddle with his Prerogative; he after tells them,
that who ſhall haſten after Grievances, and deſire to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
popular, has the Spirit of <hi>Satan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Parliament, notwithſtanding the violation of their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
the laſt Parliament; by the King's impriſoning their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
yet being zealous to aſſiſt the King againſt the Emperor,
and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in favour of the <hi>Palſgrave;</hi> and though the
Nation at no time before ſo much abounded in Corruption and
Grievances, yet to humour the King, inverted the Methods of
Proceedings in Parliament; and the Commons granted the King two
entire Subſidies, and the Clergy three, before they entred upon
Grievances, which ſo pleaſed the King, that in a Speech in the
Houſe of Lords; he declared it was more acceptable to him than
Millions, it ſhewing he reigned in the Love and Affections of his
Subjects, but he did not long hold in this Mind.</p>
                  <p>At this Seſſions of Parliament, (if it may be called ſo, no Act
but that of the Subſidies paſſing) Sir <hi>Giles Mompeſſon</hi> and Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Michel;</hi> were ſentenced and degraded, for erecting new Inns
and Ale-houſes, and exacting great Sums of Money by pretence
of Letters Patents granted for that purpoſe; Sir <hi>Giles</hi> fled, and
ſo eſcaped a farther Puniſhment, but Sir <hi>Francis</hi> was condemned
to perpetual Impriſonment in <hi>Finsbury</hi> Goal. Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi>
Viſcount <hi>Verulam;</hi> and Lord Chancellor, was likewiſe cenſured,
depoſed, fined, and committed Priſoner to the Tower for Bribery;
and <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Fall was Doctor <hi>Williams</hi>'s Riſe, Dean of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to
be Lord Keeper of the <hi>Great Seal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Commons debating the Growth of Popery, and the
dangerous Conſequences of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match, contrary to the
King's Speech and Inclinations, he upon the Fourth of <hi>June</hi>
(which the Commons took to be an Invaſion upon their Privileges)
by Commiſſion adjourned them to the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> and by
a Proclamation forbid the talking of <hi>State-Affairs.</hi> In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took <hi>Stein</hi> in the lower <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and the
Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> all the Upper <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and the Arms of <hi>Lewis</hi>
prevailed more upon the <hi>Reformed</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> yet none of theſe
prevailed upon the King, further than to mediate a Suſpenſion of
Arms, in order to treat an Accommodation between the Emperor
and his Son-in-law, and the <hi>French</hi> King and the <hi>Reformed,</hi> which
had no other Effect, but to make the King contemptible in
<hi>Germany</hi> as well as <hi>France,</hi> his Power and Authority being bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60932:52"/>
up only in Words and Meſſages, which the King's ill-Willers
blazing abroad, coſt the King more than would have recovered the
<hi>Palatinate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However the King abated nothing of his Pleaſure and diſſolute
Life, but according to the uſual Methods of his Life, in the
<hi>Autumn</hi> went to <hi>New-Market</hi> to divert himſelf with Hunting, from
the trouble of Affairs, either foreign or domeſtick, leaving his
Favourite <hi>Buckingham</hi> Dictator of all his Affairs, when the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
met again: But how remiſs ſoever the King was of his
Affairs, the Commons were not, perhaps heated by their Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and alarmed at the Progreſs of <hi>Lewis</hi> againſt the <hi>Reformed</hi>
in <hi>France;</hi> and of the Emperor, and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> not only in

                  <p>The Houſe of Commons hereupon, being ill ſatisfied with the
Diſtribution of the Subſidies before granted to the King, reſolve to

expectabamus, Heraldum accepimus,</hi> that he had great Reaſon to
have expected better from them, for the 37 Monopolies and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
called in by him ſince the laſt Receſs; and for the three,
whereof <hi>Mompeſſon</hi> and <hi>Michel</hi> were cenſured: but of theſe he
heard no news; but on the contrary, Complaints of Religion, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
implying his ill Government.</p>
                  <p>2. That the taxing him with truſting to uncertain Reports, and
partial Informations concerning their Proceedings, was needleſs,
being an old and experienced King, and in his Conſcience the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of any King alive from hearing or truſting to idle Reports<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That in the Body of their Petition, they uſurp upon his <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

then proteſt to the contrary; as if a Robber ſhould take away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Man's Purſe, and then proteſt he meant not to rob him.</p>
                  <p>3. That his Recommendation of the War for regaining the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate,</hi>
was no other than if it could not be recovered otherwiſe;
which can be no Inference, that he muſt denounce War againſt
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> break his deareſt Son's Match, and match him
to one of our Religion; which is all one as if we ſhould tell:
Merchant we had great need to borrow Money of him for raiſing
an Army, and that thereupon it ſhould follow, that we were bound
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60932:53"/>
to follow his Advice in the Direction of the War: That this Plen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
of theirs, inveſts them with all Power upon Earth, lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing but the Pope's, to have the Keys both of Heaven and
Purgatory: That it was like the <hi>Puritans</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to bring
all Cauſes within their Juriſdiction; or like <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Pope's Power over Kings, <hi>in ordine ad Spiritualia,</hi>
whereby he gives them all temporal Juriſdiction over them.</p>
                  <p>4. That he expected the Commons would have given him
Thanks for the long maintaining a ſetled Peace in all his Dominions,
when all our Neighbours about are in a miſerable Combuſtion of
War; but <hi>Dulce Bellum inexpertis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. That he had ever profeſſed to reſtore his Children to their
Patrimony by War or Peace, and that by his Credit and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and Arch-Dukes, he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the lower <hi>Palatinate</hi> from the farther conquering for one
whole Year; and that his Lord Ambaſſador <hi>Digby</hi> had extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
ſecured <hi>Heidelburg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. That he could not couple the War of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> with
the Cauſe of Religion, and that the War was not begun for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but only by his Son-in-law's haſty and raſh Reſolution to take
to himſelf the Crown of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> and that this Uſurpation of
it from the Emperor had given the Pope, and that Party, an
Occaſion to oppreſs and curb many thouſands of our Religion in
divers parts of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here I deſire that the Reader take notice of the Caſe of the
<hi>Bohemians,</hi> as it is ſet forth by <hi>Baptiſta Nani, fol. 126. Anno</hi> 1618,
after they had <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> granted them by <hi>Rodolph</hi> the
Emperor, and that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had no colour of Title to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> but as he forced the Emperor <hi>Matthias</hi> to
ſurrender it to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> ſays he, bred up in the Catholick Faith, deteſted
all ſorts of Errour; and therefore by how much not ſucceeding to
the Father, he found the Patrimonial Countries incumbred with
falſe Opinions, ſo much more with ſignal Piety had he applied
himſelf to promote the true Worſhip, with ſuch Succeſs, that at
laſt thoſe Provinces rejoiced to be reſtored to the Boſom of the
Antient Religion: But this was not without ſome Sort of Severity,
ſo that many not to leave their Errours were conſtrained to abandon
their Country, and ſell their Eſtates, living elſewhere in Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and Poverty; and others driven away by force, and their
Eſtates confiſcate, ſaw them not without Rancour, poſſeſſed by new
Maſters; <hi>and all this done in the Life of</hi> Matthias: <hi>So that</hi> Ferdinand,
<hi>as his Title was <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation and Force, ſo was the Exerciſe of it Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
in the higheſt Degree, to the Overthrow of the</hi> Bohemian <hi>Laws
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60932:54"/>
and Liberties; therefore the Original of the</hi> Bohemian <hi>War was not
founded in the Election of</hi> Frederick <hi>to be King, for</hi> Ferdinand <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated
theſe things two Years before.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nani</hi> goes on and ſays, in the Empire therefore, in which the
Religion no leſs than the <hi>Genius</hi> is for Liberty, there appeared great
Apprehenſions, that where <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould get the Power, he
would exerciſe the ſame Reformation, and impoſe a Yoke ſo much
the more heavy, by how much ſtanding in need of Money, and
the Counſels of <hi>Spain,</hi> he ſhould be governed by the Rules and
Maxims of that Nation, ſo hateful to the <hi>Germans: So that it was
not the Election of</hi> Frederick <hi>to be King of</hi> Bohemia, <hi>that opened that
Gate for the Pope and his Party, for curbing and oppreſſing of many
thouſand of our Religion in divers parts of</hi> Chriſtendom, <hi>as the King
ſaid, for it was ſet wide open before by</hi> Ferdinand.</p>
                  <p>7. That the Commons Debates concerning the War with <hi>Spain</hi>
and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match, were Matters out of their Sphere, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Ne ſutor ultra Crepida<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> and are a Diminution to him and his
Crown in Foreign Countries: That the Commons in their Petition
had attempted the higheſt Points of Soveraignty, except the
ſtamping of Coin.</p>
                  <p>8. That for Religion, he could give no other Anſwer than in
general, that the Commons may reſt ſecure, he will never be weary
to do all he can for the Propagation of ours, and repreſſing of
Popery; but the manner they muſt remit to his Care and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>9. That for the Commons Requeſt of making this a Seſſions,
and granting a <hi>General Pardon,</hi> it ſhall be their fault if it be not
done; But the Commons required ſuch Particulars in it, that he
muſt be well adviſed, leſt he give back double or treble of that
he was to receive by their Subſidy; but thinks fit that of his free
Grace he ſends down a Pardon from the higher Houſe containing
ſuch Points as he ſhall think fitteſt.</p>
                  <p>10. He thinks it ſtrange the Commons ſhould make ſo bad and
unjuſt a Commentary upon ſome Words in his former Letter, as
if he thereby meant to reſtrain the Commons of their antient
Privileges and Liberties in Parliament, wherein he diſcharges them
from meddling with Matters of Government and Myſteries of State,
namely Matters of War and Peace, or his deareſt Son's Match with
<hi>Spain,</hi> or that they meddle with things which have their ordinary
Courſe in the Courts of Juſtice: That a Scholar would be aſhamed
ſo to miſ-judg and miſplace Sentences in another Man's Book, for
in the coupling theſe Sentences they plainly leave out Myſteries of
State, and ſo err, <hi>a bene diviſis ad mala conjuncta:</hi> that for the
former part concerning Myſteries of State, he plainly reſtrained
his meaning to the Particulars which were after mentioned; and
for the latter, he confeſſes he meant it by Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>'s fooliſh
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60932:54"/>
Buſineſs, and therefore it had well become him, eſpecially being
his Servant, and one of his Council, to have complained to him,
which he never did, tho he was ordinarily at Court, and never
had Acceſs refuſed him.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>'s Buſineſs was a Conſpiracy againſt him by my
Lord Chancellor <hi>Bacon,</hi> one <hi>Lepton</hi> and <hi>Goldſmith,</hi> after he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
from being Chief Juſtice, to have exhibited an Information
againſt him in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> or have ſent him into <hi>Ireland:</hi> The
Buſineſs was debated in the Houſe of Commons, but Sir <hi>Edward</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
not, nor appeared to ſpeak in it.</p>
                  <p>If the King were uneaſy with the Commons <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> the
Commons were not leſs with the King's Anſwer, and at the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
taken at Court, to adjourn the Parliament to the <hi>8th</hi> of
<hi>January</hi> next, which the Commons took to be a Violation of their
Privileges, and an Omen of their Diſſolution; whereupon they
entred this Proteſtation.</p>
                  <p>THE Commons now Aſſembled in Parliament, being juſtly occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereunto, concerning ſundry Liberties, Franchiſes and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
of Parliament, among others here mentioned, do make this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation</hi>
following, That the Liberties, Franchiſes, Privileges and
Juriſdictions of Parliament, are the antient and undoubted Birth-right
and Inheritance of the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> and that the ardueus and
urgent Affairs concerning the King, State and Defence of the Realm,
and of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the maintenance and making of
Laws, and Redreſs of Grievances and Miſchiefs which may happen
within this Realm, are proper Subjects, and Matter of Counſel and
Debate in Parliament; and that in the handling and proceeding of thoſe
Buſineſſes, every Member of the Houſe of Parliament hath, and of
right ought to have freedom of Speech, to propound, treat, reaſon, and
bring to Concluſion the ſame: And that the Commons in Parliament
have like Liberty and Freedom to treat of theſe Matters in ſuch order,
as in their Judgment they ſhall think fitteſt: And that every Member
in the ſaid Houſe, hath likewiſe freedom from all Impeachment, Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments
and Moleſtation (other than by Cenſure of the Houſe it ſelf)
for, or concerning any ſpeaking, reaſoning or declaring any Matter or
Matters touching the Parliament, or Parliament-buſineſs. And that
if any of the ſaid Members be complained of, and queſtioned for any
thing done or ſaid in Parliament, the ſame is to be ſhewed to the King,
by the Advice and Conſent of all the Commons aſſembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
before the King give Credence to any private Information.</p>
                  <p>If the King was alarmed at the Commons Remonſtrance, this
Proteſtation of the Commons was ſuch an Invaſion upon his <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Prerogative Royal,</hi> that neglecting his Pleaſures and Health,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60932:55"/>
which he took ſuch care to preſerve, by retiring into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
up he now comes to <hi>London,</hi> and upon the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi>
and in a full Aſſembly of Council, and in the Preſence of the
Judges, declares the ſaid <hi>Proteſtation</hi> invalid, annull'd and void,
and of none effect, <hi>&amp; Manu ſua propria,</hi> takes the ſaid <hi>Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
out of the Journal-Book of the Clerk of the Commons Houſe
of Parliament, and commanded an Act of Council to be made
thereupon, and this Act to be entred in the Regiſter of the
Council-Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And on the</hi> 6th <hi>of</hi> January <hi>the King by his Proclamation
diſſolved the Parliament,</hi> Shewing that the meeting, continuing and
diſſolving of Parliaments does ſo peculiarly belong to him, that he needs
not give any account thereof to any other; yet he thought fit to declare,
that in the Diſſolution of this Parliament he had the Advice and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Conſent of his whole Council; and that ſome particular Members
of the Commons took inordinate Liberty, not only to treat of his <hi>High
Prerogatives,</hi> and ſundry things not fit to be argued in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but alſo to ſpeak with leſs reſpect of Foreign Princes: That they
ſpent their time in diſputing Privileges, and deſcanting upon the Words
and Syllables of his Letters and Meſſages; and that theſe evil-temper'd
Spirits ſowed Tares among the Corn, and by their Carriage
have impoſed upon him a neceſſity of diſcontinuing this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
without putting to it the Name or Period of a <hi>Seſſion.</hi> And
laſtly, he declared, That tho the Parliament were broken off, yet he
intended to govern well, and ſhall be glad to lay hold on the firſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to call another.</p>

                  <p>THE firſt Act the King did to make good his Promiſe in his
Proclamation to govern well, was, his Commitment of Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Coke</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Philips</hi> to the Tower, and Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mallery</hi> to other Priſons; and Sir <hi>Dudley Diggs,</hi>
Sir <hi>Thomas Crew,</hi> Sir <hi>Nathaniel Rich,</hi> and Sir <hi>James Parrot</hi> into
<hi>Ireland.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> had a Cauſe aſſigned for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment
to the Tower, but yet it was obſerved an Hardſhip upon
him, without any Precedent, that he ſhould be confined a cloſe
Priſoner for a Contempt; whereas theſe were not only confined,
but cloſe Priſoners, (for ought I can find, I am well aſſured
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60932:55"/>
Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> was) not only without any Cauſe ſhewed, but
for performing a publick Truſt repoſed in them. Nor did the
Commons only ſuffer under this Fury of the King for performing
their Duty, but the Noble Earl of <hi>Southampton</hi> was impriſoned
for his freedom of Speech, and for rebuking <hi>Buckingham</hi> for his
diſorderly ſpeaking in the Houſe of Lords, as you may ſee in the
firſt Part of Keeper <hi>Williams</hi>'s Life, <hi>fol. 62. tit.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>But of all others, this Storm fell moſt ſeverely upon Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Coke,</hi> and by ſeveral ways his Ruin was contrived: Firſt, By
ſealing up the Locks and Doors of his Chambers in <hi>London,</hi> and
in the <hi>Temple.</hi> Secondly, By ſeizing his Papers, by virtue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they took away his ſeveral Securities for Money, as a learned
Lawyer, Mr. <hi>Hawles,</hi> hath obſerved. Thirdly, It was debated in
Council, when the King would have brought in the <hi>General Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
containing ſuch Points as he ſhould think fitteſt, by what
ways they might exclude him from the benefit of it, either by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
a Bill againſt him before the Publication of it, or by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
him by Name. Fourthly, If the King's Name were uſed
by <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Somerſet</hi> to confine Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> ſo
cloſe, that neither his Father nor Servants ſhould come at him;
ſo was the King's Name uſed here, that none of Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>'s
Children or Servants ſhould come at him; and of this I am aſſured
from one of Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s Sons and his Wife. Fifthly, In this
Confinement, the King ſued him in the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> for 30000 <hi>l.
2 s. 6 d.</hi> for an old Debt pretended to be due from Sir <hi>William
Hatton</hi> to Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and this was proſecuted by Sir <hi>Henry
Yelverton,</hi> with all Severity imaginable: but herein the King's
Counſel were not all of one piece, for when a Brief againſt Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
was brought to Sir <hi>John Walter</hi> (I think) then Attorney-General,
he returned it again with this Expreſſion, <hi>Let my Tongue
cleave to the Roof of my Mouth whenever I open it againſt Sir</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Coke; however after the Trial, the Verdict was againſt the
King.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> got his Liberty by the favour of my Lord Keeper
<hi>Williams;</hi> but the reſt muſt abide by it till the breaking of the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match neceſſitated the King to call another Parliament.</p>
                  <p>But leſt the King's Word in his Proclamation for governing well
ſhould not paſs currant, and without diſpute, the King ordered
the Judges in their Circuits to give this in their Charges, That
the King taking notice of the Peoples liberal ſpeaking of Matters
far above their reach, and alſo taking notice of their licentious
undutiful Speeches touching State and Government, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
ſeveral Proclamations to the contrary, the King was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
no longer to paſs it without ſevereſt Puniſhment; and
thereupon to do exemplary Juſtice where they find any ſuch

                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:60932:56"/>
The King having in the ninth Year of his Reign borrowed
111046 <hi>l.</hi> upon <hi>Privy-Seals,</hi> which the Writer of the Hiſtorical
Narration of the firſt 14 Years of King <hi>James</hi> his Reign, <hi>Tit.
Monies raiſed by him, fol.</hi> 14. ſays, were unrepay'd: Now, ſince
he could receive no more Money in Parliament, orders the Privy-Council
to iſſue out an Order for raiſing Money out of Parliament,
for the Defence of the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> and alſo ſent Letters to the
Juſtices of the Courts in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and Barons of the
<hi>Exchequer,</hi> to move them, and perſwade others to a liberal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution
for the Recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> according to their
Qualities and Abilities: Nevertheleſs, if any Perſon ſhall, out of
Obſtinacy or Diſaffection, refuſe to contribute thereto, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
to their Eſtates and Means, they are to certify their Names
to the Council-Board.</p>
                  <p>Letters to the ſame effect were directed to the High-Sheriffs of
Counties, and Juſtices of Peace, and to the Mayors and Bayliffs of
every City and Corporation within the Kingdom, requiring them
to ſummon all before them of known Abilities within their Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
and to move them to a chearful Contribution, according
to their Means and Fortunes, in ſome good meaſure anſwerable
to what others well affected have done before them: And to make
choice of meet Collectors of the Monies, and to return a Schedule
of the Names of ſuch as ſhall contribute, and the Sums that are
offered by them; that his Majeſty may take notice of the good
Inclinations of the Subjects to a Cauſe of ſuch Importance; as
likewiſe of ſuch others, if any ſuch be, as out of Obſtinacy or
Diſaffection ſhall refuſe to contribute. Theſe were the Ways which
this pacifick King took in and out of Parliament, which I believe
(except in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>4th)</hi> were never practiſed by
any of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings; and all this under the ſpecious Pretence
of recovering his Son-in-law's Patrimony, prodigally to ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it among his Favourites, eſpecially <hi>Buckingham,</hi> whoſe Avarice
could not be ſupported otherwiſe by the Revenues of the Crown,
and Venality of all Places Sacred and Civil.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the Noble Atchievements, which this pacifick King
obtained over his Parliament, which preſumed to adviſe him for
his own Honour and the Nation's Safety; this was the Return he
made for inverting the Methods of Proceedings in Parliament to
pleaſure him, by granting Subſidies before Grievances were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt:
A Prince foreign born to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws and Conſtitutions;
<hi>A Prince,</hi> as the noble <hi>Nani, Anno 1619. fol.</hi> 137, 138. obſerves,
<hi>in whom</hi> Decorum, <hi>and want of Power, were commonly Oppoſites; he
being</hi> Scotiſh <hi>by Birth, and come to the Crown by Inheritance, was the
firſt that governed the two Nations by Natural Antipathy, and antient
Emulation of Enemies; and deſigning to reclaim the Fierceneſs of thoſe
People with Eaſe and Idleneſs, had ſet up his Reſt in Peace; and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60932:56"/>
avoiding, as much as poſſible, the calling of Parliaments, without
which not having the Power to impoſe Contributions, nor levy Money,
he contented himſelf rather to ſtruggle with many Straits and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
than to ſee them meet with a Jealouſy of them; or being met,
be obliged to ſeparate them with the diſguſt of the People, or with the
ſatisfaction of Prejudice to the Superior in Power.</hi> A Prince ſo poor
before he came to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> that if he had not been
ſupported by the Penſion which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> allowed him,
could not have maintained the Garb of many of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and being come to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> not only the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Patrimony of it was ſquandered and embaraſſed upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
and profane Favourites, but the People otherwiſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
with almoſt infinite Monopolies and Projects, which the
Nation never before heard of; and as they were new, ſo were
they all illegal; and all theſe to make his Favourites rich, while
he continued the pooreſt King that ever governed <hi>England:</hi> Juſtled
in his Throne by the <hi>Presbytery</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet nothing leſs than
<hi>Sacred</hi> would down with him from the Clergy in <hi>England,</hi> tho his
diſſolute Life and profane Converſation were diametrically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, by a twenty Years Habit, were ſo fixed in the King, a
Prince of all others the moſt regardleſs of his Honour and Word,
that they became natural: So that after the Parliament had given
him two Subſidies, and intended another for carrying on the War
for the recovery of the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> and after he had by ſuch
means, as before ſaid, by ſuch Terror raiſed Benevolences all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
over upon pretence of it; yet by the Advice of <hi>Buckingham</hi>
and <hi>Gundamor,</hi> he placed the Anchor of his Hope to do it by the
Match of his Son with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> when an unlooked-for
Accident, reported by <hi>Nani,</hi> in his <hi>5th</hi> Book, <hi>fol.</hi> 186. had like
to have ſpoiled all.</p>
                  <p>For the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> weary of being amuſed, and deluded
with the Hopes of his Father-in-law's Treaties, which he now ſaw
were mocked by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves, in a Diſguiſe, with two
Perſons only, from <hi>Holland</hi> paſſes into <hi>France</hi> by Sea, and from thence
through <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and through the midſt of his Enemies Troops,
arrives at <hi>Landau,</hi> where Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> (who then made War
in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> in his Right) had a Gariſon, where he diſcovered
himſelf, and from thence went to <hi>Germerſheim,</hi> where he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with the general Applauſe of the whole Army.</p>
                  <p>This Eſcape of the King's Son-in-law confounded all the King's
Meaſures which he had taken for him, by the Marriage of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi>
with his Son, ſo that he was more alarm'd at it, than at the
Commons Remonſtrance and Proteſtation, tho he bore the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with a much better Temper: So all Wits were ſet at work how
to get the Elector out of the Hands of <hi>Mansfield</hi> back again into
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60932:57"/>
                     <hi>Holland;</hi> for now the Proceedings at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> upon the Peace, were
put to a full ſtop, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> alledging they could not proceed
in the Treaty ſo long as the King's Son-in-law was in the Hands of
<hi>Mansfield,</hi> their moſt inveterate and bitter Enemy.</p>
                  <p>It fell out luckily for the King's Deſigns, tho unluckily for his
Son-in-law's, that <hi>Mansfield</hi> being worſted by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Arms in
the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> fearing that <hi>Mansfield</hi> in
the Adverſity of his Affairs would make him a Sacrifice, in giving
him up to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to make his own Terms the better, was
the more eaſily enveagled by the King's Agents to return again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Holland,</hi> where the firſt News he heard was, that <hi>Tilly</hi> had taken
<hi>Heidelburg</hi> (the Capital Seat of his Anceſtors) by Storm, and
<hi>Frankendal</hi> (his next City) reduced to Extremity by <hi>Cordua;</hi> ſo
that, as <hi>Nani</hi> ſays, <hi>fol.</hi> 188. King <hi>James<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> who had publiſhed that
his Son-in-law held that Country under his Protection, was laugh'd
at by all the World, and forced to conſent to a Truce for fifteen
Months, during which <hi>Frankendal,</hi> and the reſt of the lower <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate,</hi>
ſhould be depoſited into the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Hands, to reſtore
them to the King <hi>(James)</hi> if within that time there were not a
Peace concluded.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>James</hi> having thus depoſited his Son-in-law's Patrimony
in the Hands of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> now by the
Direction of <hi>Buckingham</hi> (not only the Dictator over the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but over the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and 'twas feared more over the Prince) upon pretence that
the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> was too remiſs in proſecuting the Prince's Suit
at <hi>Madrid,</hi> reſolves to depoſite the Prince in the Power of the
Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> there to remain as an Hoſtage till he can procure
the <hi>Infanta</hi> to be his Spouſe.</p>
                  <p>This was ſuch an Adventure, as <hi>Don Quixot</hi> never dream'd of
in any of his; that becauſe the King, the Prince his Father, was
poor at home, and deſpiſed abroad, therefore by making his
only Son an Hoſtage in another King's Court, where the Maxims
both of Religion and State were directly contrary, he ſhould think
to perſwade the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to overturn all, and alſo get ſuch a
Portion as was fourfold more than any Prince before had, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
himſelf, and to make War againſt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> eſteemed all as one; and alſo that the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould reſtore the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> becauſe the King
knew not which way elſe to do it: Yet this Adventure muſt be
run, becauſe <hi>Buckingham</hi> would have it ſo; ſo pur-blind, nay,
ſtark-blind, does Poverty and Covetouſneſs make Man's Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But that we may take all before us, let's ſee in what Eſteem
King</hi> James <hi>was with the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>which might encourage him
to purſue this Adventure.</hi> In their Comedies in <hi>Flanders,</hi> they imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60932:57"/>
Meſſengers bringing News in haſte, that the <hi>Palatinate</hi> was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to have a numerous Army ſhortly on foot: For the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>
would ſhortly furniſh them with a thouſand <hi>Pickled-Herrings,</hi> the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> with one hundred thouſand <hi>Butter-Boxes,</hi> and <hi>England</hi>
with one hundred thouſand <hi>Ambaſſadors:</hi> They pictured King <hi>James</hi> in
one place, with a Scabbard without a Sword; in another, with a
Sword which no body could draw out, tho divers Perſons ſtood pulling
at it: In <hi>Bruſſels</hi> they painted him with his Pockets hanging out, and
not one Penny in them, and his Purſe turned upſide down: In <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi>
they pictured the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> like a poor <hi>Iriſh</hi> Mantler,
with her Hair hanging about her Ears, with her Child at her Back,
and the King <hi>(James)</hi> carrying the Cradle after her; and every one
of the Pictures had ſeveral <hi>Motto's</hi> expreſſing their Malice. <hi>Such
Scorns and Contempts were put upon the King</hi> (James) <hi>and in
him the whole Nation. See the Preface to the Hiſtory of the firſt
14 Years of the Reign of King</hi> James, <hi>and</hi> Wilſon, <hi>fol.</hi> 192.</p>
                  <p>But tho <hi>Buckingham</hi> purſued this Match with ſuch Eagerneſs,
yet when it came to his Management in <hi>Spain,</hi> where the King's
Proclamations forbidding Men to talk of <hi>State-Affairs</hi> had no effect,
he proceeded wrong in every ſtep of it; and to gratify his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Perſonal Diſguſts, was the firſt and principal Inſtrument
to break it off: but that we may not inſiſt upon Generals;</p>
                  <p>1. The Prince's coming to <hi>Spain,</hi> and thereby putting himſelf
into the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Power, brake all the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi>'s
Meaſures, whereupon the Negotiation, and all the Particulars of
the Marriage was ſettled, and the Negotiation was put into a new
Form. See <hi>Ruſhw. Collect.</hi> fol. 286.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection.</hi> This was but a Charge by the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> againſt
the Duke, who proſecuted the Earl of <hi>High Miſdemeanors,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no Proof againſt the Duke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Yet the Honour of ſo great a Stateſman, and faithful
a Counſellor as the Earl was, who had ſo honourably ſerved the
King in ſeven foreign Embaſſies, and had by the Expence of
10000 <hi>l.</hi> ſaved <hi>Heidelburg</hi> from falling into the Hands of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard;</hi>
and having upon the Diſſolution of the laſt Parliament
given the King 500 <hi>l.</hi> upon the Benevolence, and never received
a Check from the King in all his Negotiations, but always honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Teſtimonies from him for his faithful Services, before <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham</hi>
broke in upon him, may go a great way.</p>
                  <p>But it ſeems to me to be a clear Proof upon <hi>Buckingham,</hi> for
<hi>Briſtol</hi> twice anſwered Articles preferred againſt him, without any
Reply; whereas rather than <hi>Buckingham</hi> ſhould anſwer <hi>Briſtol</hi>'s
Charge, King <hi>(Charles)</hi> diſſolved his ſecond Parliament.</p>

                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:60932:58"/>
2. <hi>Buckingham</hi> had not learned the Verſe which is taught to
every School-boy, <hi>Quum fueris Romae, Romano vivito more;</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>French</hi> bred, he appeared in a <hi>French</hi> Garb (moſt hateful to
the <hi>Spaniards)</hi> and by his Familiarity with the Prince, he ſeemed
rather the Prince's Guardian and Companion, than Follower, which
diſreliſhed the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in general, who
are grave, ſober and wary.</p>
                  <p>3. He by contrary Methods oppoſed all the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi>'s
Methods, nay, fell at odds with him, tho, without Compariſon, he
was the ableſt Stateſman in all King <hi>James</hi> his Councils.</p>
                  <p>4. Whereas all other Ambaſſadors and Stateſmen, in all great
Affairs, make their Court to the King's Council, and prime Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of State, to attain their Ends, <hi>Buckingham</hi> fell at open De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
with <hi>Olivares</hi> (prime Miniſter of State in <hi>Spain)</hi> and 'twas
generally ſaid, made his Court to the Counteſs, which ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
her Husband with, and inſtead of the Counteſs, put a
tainted Whore to Bed with him.</p>
                  <p>5. The Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> in the <hi>9th</hi> Article of his Charge againſt
him, ſhews what a Scandal <hi>Buckingham</hi> gave by his Perſonal Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in <hi>Spain;</hi> and alſo employing his Power with the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> for procuring Favours and Offices, which he beſtowed upon
baſe and unworthy Perſons, for the Recompence and Hire of his
Luſt. Theſe things as fit neither for the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> to ſpeak,
nor the Lords to hear, he left to their Lordſhips Wiſdom, how
far they pleaſe to have them examined: It having been a great
Infamy to this Nation, that a Perſon of the Duke's great Quality
and Employments, a Privy-Counſellor, and Ambaſſador, eminent
in his Majeſty's Favour, and ſolely in Truſt with the Prince, ſhould
leave behind him in a Foreign Court ſo much Scandal as he did by
his ill Behaviour.</p>
                  <p>6. The Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi>'s ſixth Article againſt <hi>Buckingham</hi> is, That
his Behaviour in <hi>Spain</hi> was ſuch, that he thereby ſo incenſed the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Miniſters, that they would admit of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
nor farther Dealings with him: Whereupon he ſeeing
the ſaid Match would be to his Prejudice, he endeavoured to break
it, not for any Service to the Kingdom, nor of the Match it ſelf,
nor for that he had found (as ſince he pretended) the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
did not really intend the ſaid Match, but out of his particular
Ends and Indignation: And the <hi>7th</hi> Article ſays,</p>
                  <p>7. That after he intended to croſs the ſaid Match, he put in
practice divers undue Courſes, as making uſe of the Prince's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to his own Ends, and not as they were intended; as likewiſe
of concealing things of high Importance to the King <hi>(James)</hi>
and thereby to overthrow the King's Purpoſes, and advance his
own Ends.</p>

Nor had my Lord Keeper <hi>Williams</hi> any better luck in this Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s than the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> or <hi>Olivares;</hi> for tho
the Prince's going into <hi>Spain</hi> was concealed from the Keeper as
well as Council, yet after the Duke was gone, the Keeper's Letters
followed him to <hi>Madrid,</hi> wherein the Keeper adviſed him to be
circumſpect in all his Actions, that no Offence might be taken at
any of them by the King and Miniſters of <hi>Spain;</hi> and to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
by the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> not only as a moſt able Stateſman,
but above all others, the moſt experienced in the Manners of the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> and Court of <hi>Spain:</hi> but this <hi>Buckingham</hi> took as ill
Manners in the Keeper, and was an occaſion of his quarrelling
with him, as you may read in the Life of the Lord Keeper, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield</hi> and <hi>Coventry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But neither the danger of the Prince in <hi>Spain,</hi> nor the croſs-grain'd
going of the Match any way abated the King's Favour to
his beloved Scholar and Diſciple <hi>Buckingham;</hi> but he ſent after
him the Patent of being created a Duke, there being not another
of <hi>England:</hi> So that now he is become Duke, Marqueſs and Earl
of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Earl of <hi>Coventry,</hi> Viſcount <hi>Villiers,</hi> Baron of
<hi>Whaddon,</hi> Great Admiral of the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and the Principality of <hi>Wales,</hi> and of the Dominions and Iſlands
of the ſame, of the Town of <hi>Calais,</hi> and of the Marches of the
ſame, and of <hi>Normandy, Gaſcoign</hi> and <hi>Guienne,</hi> General Governor
of the Seas and Ships of the Kingdom, Maſter of the Horſe to
the King, Lord Warden, Chancellor and Admiral of the Cinque
Ports, and of the Members of the ſame; Conſtable of <hi>Dover-Caſtle,</hi>
Juſtice in Eyre of all the Foreſts and Chaſes on this ſide

Privy-Council in his Realms of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
Knight of the moſt Honourable Order of the Garter.</p>
                  <p>But tho all others worſhipped this prodigious Favourite; yet
Arch-biſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> (a Prelate of Primitive Sanctity and Integrity)
would not flatter neither the King nor his Favourite in their
Courſes, ſo dangerous to the Church and State, and diſhonourable
to the King; and, tho in Diſgrace, he wrote this following Letter
to the King, which you may read in <hi>Ruſhworth,</hi> fol. 85.</p>

call me unto, and your Majeſty to place me in: But now I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
crave leave I may diſcharge my Conſcience towards God,
and my Duty to your Majeſty; and therefore freely to give
me leave to deliver my ſelf, and then let your Majeſty do what
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60932:59"/>
you pleaſe. Your Majeſty hath propounded a Toleration of
Religion; I beſeech you to take into your Conſideration, what
that Act is, what the Conſequence may be: By your Act you
labour to ſet up the moſt Damnable and Heretical Doctrine of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Whore of <hi>Babylon:</hi> How hateful will it be to
God, and grievous to your Subjects, the Profeſſors of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
that your Majeſty, who hath ſo often and learnedly diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and written againſt thoſe Hereſies; ſhould now ſhew your
ſelf a Patron of thoſe wicked Doctrines, which your Pen hath
to the World, and your Conſcience tells your ſelf are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious,
idolatrous and deteſtable? and hereto I add what you
have done by ſending the Prince into <hi>Spain,</hi> without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of your Council, the Privity or Approbation of your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and altho you have a Charge and Intereſt in the Prince
as the Son of your Fleſh, yet the People have a greater, as
Son of the Kingdom, upon whom, next after your Majeſty,
are their Eyes fixed, and their Welfare depends; and ſo tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is his going apprehended (as I believe) however his Return
may be ſafe; yet the Drawers of him into this Action, ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to himſelf, ſo deſperate to the Kingdom, will not paſs
away unqueſtion'd and unpuniſhed. Beſides, the Toleration
which you endeavour to ſet up by your Proclamation, cannot
be without a Parliament, unleſs your Majeſty will let your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ſee that you will take to your ſelf the Ability to throw
down the Laws of the Land at your Pleaſure. What dread
Conſequence theſe things may draw afterwards, I beſeech your
Majeſty to conſider, and above all, leſt by this Toleration and
diſcountenancing the true Profeſſion of the Goſpel, wherewith
God hath bleſt us, and this Kingdom hath ſo long flouriſhed
under it, your Majeſty doth not draw upon this Kingdom in

                  <p>I have heard my Father ſay, that King <hi>James</hi> kept a Fool called
<hi>Archy</hi> (if he were not more Knave) whom the Courtiers, when the
King was at any time thoughtful or ſerious, would bring in with
his antick Geſtures and Sayings, to put him out of it. In one of
theſe Modes of the King, in comes <hi>Archy,</hi> and tells the King he
muſt change Caps with him; Why? ſays the King: Why who, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<hi>Archy,</hi> ſent the Prince into <hi>Spain?</hi> But what, ſaid the King,
wilt thou ſay, if the Prince comes back again? Why then, ſaid
<hi>Archy,</hi> I will take my Cap from thy Head, and ſend it to the King
of <hi>Spain:</hi> which was ſaid troubled the King ſore.</p>
                  <p>But if we look back into <hi>Spain,</hi> we ſhall ſee things of another
Complection than when <hi>Buckingham</hi> came into it: For now he is
diſguſted, he put<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Prince quite out of the Match, as that tho
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60932:59"/>
all things were agreed upon the coming of the Diſpenſation from
<hi>Rome,</hi> ſo as King <hi>James</hi> ſaid all the Devils in Hell could not break
the Match (yet his Diſciple and Scholar could) tho the Duke had
certified the King the Match was brought to a happy Concluſion,
and the Match publickly declar'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Prince permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Acceſs to the <hi>Infanta</hi> in the Preſence of the King, and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi>
was generally ſtiled the Princeſs of <hi>England;</hi> and in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
a Chappel was building for her at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and the King
had prepared a Fleet to fetch her into <hi>England,</hi> which only proved
to bring back his Son.</p>
                  <p>How things (eſpecially actuated by Love) ſhould ſtay here,
may ſeem ſtrange; yet ſuch an Aſcendant had <hi>Buckingham</hi> over the
Prince, that the Affront put upon him <hi>(Buckingham)</hi> muſt quite
deface the Prince's vowed Love and Affection to the <hi>Infanta;</hi> but
how to prevail with King <hi>James</hi> to comply, might have an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of ſome Difficulty, ſince the King had ſet his Reſt upon
it, and had quarelled with the Parliament, and diſſolv'd them in
great Anger and Fury for but mentioning it.</p>
                  <p>After the Duke had gained the Prince to break, or at leaſt not to
obſerve the Conditions of the Treaty of the Marriage with the
<hi>Infanta,</hi> ſo ſolemnly ſworn to by both the Kings and the Prince;
let's now ſee how he behaved himſelf to King <hi>James</hi> afterwards:
but this will be better underſtood if we look back, and ſee how
things ſtood before the Prince's and Duke's Arrival in <hi>Spain.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Prince's going into</hi> Spain, <hi>was not only kept ſecret from
King</hi> James'<hi>s Council, but from my Lord Keeper</hi> Williams, <hi>tho
the King confided in his Abilities above all the other of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil:
but when it had taken vent, the King asked the Keeper what
he thought,</hi> Whether the Knight Errant's Pilgrimage <hi>(meaning the
Prince's)</hi> would prove lucky to win the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady, and to convey
her ſhortly into <hi>England?</hi> Sir, <hi>anſwered my Lord Keeper,</hi> If my
Lord Marqueſs will give Honour to <hi>Conde</hi> Duke <hi>Olivares,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
he is the Favourite of <hi>Spain;</hi> or if <hi>Olivares;</hi> will ſhew honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Civility to my Lord Marqueſs, remembring he is a Favourite of
<hi>England,</hi> the Wooing may be proſperous: but if my Lord Marqueſs
ſhould forget where he is, and not ſtoop to <hi>Olivares;</hi> or if <hi>Olivares,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
what Gueſt he hath received with the Prince, bear himſelf
haughtily, and like a <hi>Caſtilian</hi> to my Lord Marqueſs, the Provocation
may be dangerous to croſs your Majeſty's good Intentions; and I pray
God, that either one or both do not run into that Error.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Anſwer of the Keeper took ſuch Impreſſion upon the King,
that he asked the Keeper, if he had wrote to his Son and the
Marqueſs clearly, and upon what Guard he ſhould ſtand.</hi> Yes,
<hi>ſaid the Keeper,</hi> and to that purpoſe I have diſpatched ſome Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets:
Then continue, <hi>ſays the King,</hi> to help me and them in thoſe
Difficulties with your beſt Powers and Abilities, and ſerve me faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60932:60"/>
in this Motion, which, like the higheſt Orb, carries all my Rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calta's,
my Counſels at preſent, and Proſpects upon the future with it,
and I will never part with you. <hi>Which you may read in the firſt
part of the Keeper's Life,</hi> fol. 115. tit. 127.</p>
                  <p>The Keeper hereupon continues to proſecute this Advice to the
Marqueſs (after Duke) but hereby loſt the Duke's Favour, who
ever after ſought all means to ruin the Keeper, which tho he could
not effect in King <hi>James</hi> his Reign, he did it in the firſt Year of
his Son's.</p>
                  <p>But when the King underſtood, that the Contraventions of the
Duke with <hi>Olivares</hi> and <hi>Briſtol</hi> was like to make a Rupture in the
Treaty, he then began ſeriouſly to conſider with himſelf the fickle
State he ſtood in both at home and abroad; if the Marriage ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
not; all the two Subſidies he had granted him by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and the Benevolence he had raiſed after upon his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
by his own Authority, was expended, and a great Debt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
beſides; he alſo, beſides the Benevolence, ſtood upon ill
Terms with his Subjects, for petitioning him againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Match, and aſſerting their Privileges, by impriſoning them after he
had diſſolved the Parliament, the like whereof was never before
done by any of his Predeceſſors: and now <hi>Buckingham</hi> had ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
cauſed a Rupture of the Match, wherein he placed his ſole
Felicity, he had not Courage ſo much as to frown upon him, who
could contribute no Relief, whereas he diſſolved the Parliament, and
impriſoned the Members upon their Advice againſt the Match, who
could have relieved him in his Neceſſities; beſides, he now ſaw that
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> by his Audacity, more worſhipped the Sun in its Riſe
than in its Declination: Now did he not know to whom he ſhould

give him any Advice.</p>
                  <p>In caſe a Rupture happened, the King after all this wild Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of Foreign Embaſſies, and the Charge of his Son's Voyage
to <hi>Spain,</hi> would be deſpiſed by all Foreign Princes and States, in
caſe he did not endeavour to recover his Son-in-law's Patrimony,
which would, in all appearance, bring on a War between him and
the Emperor, and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who kept nothing from him,
and therefore had no cauſe to make War upon either.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, in caſe the King made War for the Recovery of the
Pa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>atinate, he could not hope to do it upon his own ſingle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
but in Conjunction with Foreign Confederates, and above
all with the States of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Netherlands</hi> (who now had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
the War againſt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Truce made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in 1609, being expired.)
But how uniuſt would this be, for the King to make War upon
the Emperor, and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who kept nothing from him,
and join with the <hi>Dutch</hi> herein, who, againſt the Treaty made
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60932:60"/>
between the King and them but three Years before, <hi>viz.</hi> in 1619,
kept from the King and his Subjects the Iſles of <hi>Amboyna, Seran,
Nero, Waire, Roſingen, Latro, Cambello, Mitto, Larica, Lantare,
Polaway</hi> and <hi>Machaſſer</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Idies,</hi> and <hi>Cabo de Bon Eſperanza</hi>
in <hi>Africk.</hi> But the Impolicy of ſuch an Alliance would be as
great as the Injuſtice of it, for hereby the <hi>Engliſh</hi> muſt loſe the
benefit of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade, which above all others enriched the
Nation, and the King his Cuſtoms, which above any other did ariſe
from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe Conſiderations fixed in the King's Mind, fearful of any
War, ſo cleft his Heart,</hi> That, <hi>as the Biſhop of</hi> Litchfield <hi>obſerves,</hi>
he effected neither, yet he ſubmitted himſelf to be ruled by ſome, whom
he ſhould have awed by his Authority, but wanted Courage to bow them
to his Bent. A Prince that preſerves not the Rights of his Dignity,
and the Majeſty of his Throne, is a Servant to ſome, but a Friend
to none, and leaſt to himſelf; <hi>as you may ſee in his Book,</hi> fol. 167.
tit. 173.</p>
                  <p>In theſe Perplexities the King ſaw no viſible Means under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to relieve him, but by cloſing with his next Parliament; and
it was obſerved, that ſome Impreſſions were gotten into the King's
Mind, that he was ſo reſolved to be a Lover of Parliaments, that
he would cloſe with the next that was called; nor was there
any likelihood that any Man's Incolumity, tho it were his Grace
himſelf, ſhould cauſe an unkind Breach between him and his
People.</p>
                  <p>This Reſolution of the King's was not concealed from a Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
or Cabal of the Duke's which met at <hi>Wallingford</hi>-Houſe, who
hereupon ſet up to conſider what Exploit the Duke ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
to be the Darling of the Commons, and as it were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicate
his Lordſhip, and to be precious to thoſe who had the
Vogue to be the chief Lovers of their Country; and reſolve that
all Attempts would be in vain, unleſs the Treaty of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Match were quaſh'd, and that the Breach thereof ſhould fall upon
the Duke's Induſtry; ſo that what the Duke did before in ſpite to
<hi>Olivares</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> he now purſues for his own Safety, tho the
King had little reaſon to thank him for it. See the firſt Part of
the Keeper's Life, <hi>fol. 137. tit.</hi> 147. And this took ſuch Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in the Duke, that the Biſhop heard the Duke afterward in the
Banqueting-Houſe, before the King and both Houſes of Parliament,
aſcribe to himſelf the ſole Glory of breaking the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match;
and you will ſoon ſee how the Prince and Duke after their return
from <hi>Spain</hi> over-awed the King, and made his Authority bow
to their Bent: for notwithſtanding <hi>Buckingham</hi> blaſted all the
<hi>Raccalta</hi>'s of his Counſels, and the Proſpect of his future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
placed in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match, yet he ſhall become the
Duke's Advocate herein, and note his Fidelity, Conſtancy and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60932:61"/>
Conduct in breaking it off; and from his Diſciple become his
Maſter, and teach him, that <hi>Doloſus verſatur in Generalibus,</hi> and
alſo keep back the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> from coming to the Parliament,
that he might not ſpoil the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ine Tale the Duke had told; yet at
other times the King would ſay, <hi>If he had ſent</hi> Williams <hi>into</hi>
Spain <hi>with his Son, he had kept Heart-eaſe and Honour both, which

tit.</hi> 174.</p>
                  <p>The Duke thus doubly engaged, reſolved to break the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Match; and to diſpoſe the King <hi>(James)</hi> to it, the Prince writes
to him, <hi>That he muſt look upon his Siſter (the Queen of</hi> Bohemia)
<hi>and her Children, never thinking more of him, and forgetting he ever
had ſuch a Son.</hi> Though it be evident the generous <hi>Spaniards</hi> were
far enough from entertaining ſuch a thought, however <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>'s
Behaviour might have prompted them to it, that by the
Authority of <hi>Litchfield</hi> and <hi>Ruſhworth,</hi> they entertained him with
all imaginable Eſteem, as a truly noble, diſcreet and well-deſerving
Prince; however the Prince himſelf had given them Cauſe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to have detained him, if the Prudence of <hi>Briſtol</hi> had not
been greater than <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Raſhneſs and Zeal to break off the
Match, ſolemnly ſworn to by the Prince and <hi>Buckingham</hi> himſelf,
and this upon the Day when the Prince parted from the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> from the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> as you may ſee in the Biſhop of <hi>Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>'s
Life of Dr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and <hi>Ruſhworth, fol.</hi> 284, 285.</p>
                  <p>For though the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Prince had ſolemnly
ſworn to accompliſh the Marriage, and to make the Eſpouſals
within ten Days after the Ratifications ſhould come from <hi>Rome,</hi> to
which purpoſe the Prince made a <hi>Procuration</hi> to the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Don Charles</hi> his Brother, to make the Eſpouſals in his
Name, and left it in the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi>'s hands; yet he (the
Prince) left in the Hands of one of the Duke's Creatures, Mr.
<hi>Edward Clarke,</hi> a private Inſtrument, with Inſtructions to the
Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to ſtay the Delivery of the <hi>Proxies</hi> till farther Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from him. But when this private Inſtrument was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> he told <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Favourite that it muſt for a
time be concealed, leſt the <hi>Spaniard</hi> coming to the knowledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
of it, ſhould give Order to ſtay the Prince. So that the Duke
left the Earl's Inſtrument as perplexed and confounded when he
went out of <hi>Spain,</hi> as he had made the Treaty of Marriage when
he came into it.</p>
                  <p>The Temper and Diſſimulation of the Duke is ſo ſtrange at his
taking leave of <hi>Olivares,</hi> as is I believe without all Example, and
alſo without any Care of the Safety of the Prince; for the Duke
told him, after he had delivered the Inſtrument to ſtay the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of the <hi>Proxy,</hi> That he was obliged to the King and Queen
and <hi>Infanta</hi> in an eternal Tie of Gratitude, and that he would be an
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60932:61"/>
everlaſting Servant to them, and endeavour to do the beſt Offices
for concluding the Match, and ſtrengthning the Amity between
the two Crowns; but as for himſelf <hi>(Olivares)</hi> he had ſo diſobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him, that he could not without Flattery, make the leaſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Friendſhip to him.</p>
                  <p>Nor was the Ingratitude and Diſſimulation of the Prince leſs
than that of <hi>Buckingham:</hi> for when the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had brought
the Prince to the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> where the Prince and Duke (after the
delivery of the Inſtrument for ſtaying the Proxy) ſolemnly ſwore
the Treaty of Marriage, as you may read in <hi>Ruſhworth, fol.</hi> 285.
and the King and Prince had ſworn a perpetual League of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
as the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield</hi> ſays; the King at their Departure
declared the Obligation which the Prince had put upon him (the
King) by putting himſelf into his Hands, a thing unuſual with
Princes, and proteſted he earneſtly deſired a nearer Conjunction of
Brotherly Affection, for the more intire Unity between them.
The Prince anſwered him, magnifying the high Favour which he
had found during his Stay in his Court and Preſence, which
had begotten ſuch an Eſtimation of his Worth, that he knew not
how to value it, but would leave a <hi>Mediatrix</hi> to ſupply his own
Defects, if he (the King) would make him ſo happy, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
him (the Prince) in the good Opinion of her his Dear Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.
Yet the Prince ſo ſoon as he came on Ship-board, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to ſay, <hi>That it was a great Weakneſs and Folly in the</hi> Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
<hi>after they had uſed him ſo ill, to grant him a free Departure;
and ſoon you'll ſee both the Prince and the Duke urge the King</hi>
(James) <hi>to break off the Match ſo ſolemnly ſworn by them all, and
make War upon the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>which was ſo dangerous to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to mention.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus taken a View of the Duke's Prudence and deep In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
in Myſteries of State in managing this Match, where King
<hi>James</hi>'s Proclamation could not reſtrain Men from talking of
State-Affairs: We will now take a View of the Duke's Profeſſion
in Religion, that another may better judg, whether he were more
eminent in Religion or State-policy; and herein I will take the Earl
of <hi>Briſtol</hi>'s Charge upon him to be a full Proof, ſince the Earl an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the Duke's Charges againſt him twice, firſt before King
<hi>James,</hi> and afterward in Parliament in the <hi>2d</hi> of King <hi>Charles,</hi>
without any reply; and King <hi>Charles</hi> his diſſolving the Parliament,
rather than the Duke ſhould come to a Tryal upon the Articles
which the Earl exhibited againſt him.</p>
                  <p>1. The Earl, in the ſaid Articles, charges the Duke, that he did
ſecretly combine with the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Gundamor</hi> Ambaſſador from
the King of <hi>Spain, Anno</hi> 1622, to carry the Prince into <hi>Spain,</hi> to
the end he might be informed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and thereby
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60932:62"/>
have perverted the Prince, and ſubverted the true Religion eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> was made acquainted therewith, and ſent
into <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſuch Meſſages at his Return framed, as might
ſerve for a Ground to ſet on foot this Conſpiracy; the which was
done accordingly, and thereby the King and Prince highly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and their Conſents thereby gotten for the ſaid Journey, <hi>viz.</hi>
after the Return of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> which was about the latter
end of <hi>December</hi> or beginning of <hi>January,</hi> 1622. whereas the
Duke plotted it many Months before.</p>
                  <p>3. That the Duke at his Arrival in <hi>Spain,</hi> nouriſhed the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Miniſters, not only in the Belief of his being popiſhly affected,
but did (both by abſenting himſelf from all Exerciſes of Religion
conſtantly uſed in the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi>'s Houſe, and frequented by
all other Proteſtant <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and by conforming himſelf to pleaſe
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in divers Rites of their Religion, even ſo far as to
kneel and adore the Sacrament) from time to time give the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
Hopes of the Prince's Converſion, the which he endeavoured
to procure by all means poſſible; and thereby cauſed the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Miniſter to propound far worſe Conditions for Religion than had
been propounded by the Earl and Sir <hi>Walter Aſhton,</hi> ſetled and ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under the K. and Prince's Hand, with a clauſe of the K. of <hi>Spain</hi>'s
Anſwer, <hi>Dec.</hi> 12. 1622, that they held the Articles agreed on ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
and ſuch as ought to induce the Pope to grant the Diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p>4. That the Duke having ſeveral times moved and preſſed the
King <hi>(James)</hi> at the Inſtance of the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Gundamor,</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to write a Letter to the Pope, and to
that purpoſe having once brought a Letter ready drawn wherewith
the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> by his Majeſty being made acquainted, did ſo
ſtrongly oppoſe the writing any ſuch Letter, that during the Abode
of the ſaid Earl in <hi>England,</hi> the Duke could never obtain it; but not
long after the Earl was gone, he (the Duke) procured ſuch a
Letter to be written from the King <hi>(James)</hi> to the Pope, and to
have him ſtiled <hi>Sanctiſſime Pater.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. That the Pope being informed of the Duke's Inclination and
Intention in point of Religion, ſent unto him a particular <hi>Bull</hi> in
Parchment, for to perſwade and encourage him in the Perverſion
of the Prince.</p>
                  <p>But how ſteady ſoever the Duke was in his <hi>French</hi> Garb in <hi>Spain,</hi>
and of Compliance with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the Popiſh Religion; yet
he was not ſo when he returned into <hi>England,</hi> for then he turns
quite contrary, and aſſumes a popular Way, and joins with the
Prince, and thereby over-ruled the King as they pleaſed, and cloſed
with the Nobility, and <hi>Puritan</hi> Party, oppoſite to <hi>Spain:</hi> As you
may read in <hi>Ruſhworth, fol.</hi> 107.</p>
                  <p>Nor was the Duke's Covetouſneſs, and ſacrilegious Deſires of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60932:62"/>
robbing the Church's Patrimony, leſs than his Hypocriſy in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
for whilſt he was in this Godly Fit, he treats with Dr. <hi>John
Preſton</hi> (Head of the Puritan Party) how the King might ſeize
the Dean and Chapter Lands, as you may read in the Biſhop of
<hi>Litchfield</hi>'s Life of Doctor <hi>Williams, 1ſt Part, fol.</hi> 202.</p>
                  <p>After the Return of the Prince and Duke into <hi>England,</hi> and
<hi>Briſtol</hi> left in <hi>Spain,</hi> both contrive how to ruin the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi>
bound up with contrary Inſtructions; and to diſſolve the Prince's
Match with the <hi>Infanta,</hi> ſo ſolemnly ſworn by both Kings, and the
Prince; and could find no other Pretence to do it, but by the King's
Letter to the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> before he delivered the Powers for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummating
the Marriage, to procure from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> either
by publick Act or under his Hand and Seal, a direct Engagement for
the Reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> and Electoral Dignity, by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
or Aſſiſtance of Arms; but in regard this muſt be now
inſiſted upon, let's ſee how this ſtood during the Treaty.</p>
                  <p>In all the Treaty for this Match, the Reſtitution of the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>
was laid aſide, as <hi>Ruſhworth</hi> obſerves <hi>fol.</hi> 91. and my Lord of
<hi>Briſtol</hi> in his Defence againſt the Duke's or King's Charge, <hi>fol.</hi> 302.
ſays, that his Inſtructions from King <hi>James</hi> the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>March
1621,</hi> were expreſs, that he ſhould not make the Buſineſs of the
<hi>Palatinate</hi> a Condition of the Marriage; and that of the King's of
the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1623 (I think it was 1622) were fully to
the ſame Effect: But now the whole Treaty which was ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agreed upon and ſworn to by both Kings and the Prince, and
that the Marriage ſhould be conſummate within 10 days after the
Diſpenſation came from <hi>Rome,</hi> which it did about the beginning
of <hi>December</hi> 1623, muſt be all daſht without the Reſtitution
of the <hi>Palatine</hi> to his Country and Electoral Dignity, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perplext with ſuch Variety of Intereſts, as the Duke of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi>'s
having poſſeſt himſelf of the upper <hi>Palatinate;</hi> and the
Reſtitution of the <hi>Palſgrave,</hi> being an Act of the Emperor and
Empire, was not in the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Power: Nay the <hi>Proxies</hi>
left with the Earl, would not admit of a Treaty in this Caſe, for
the Marriage was to be conſummate within ten Days after the
Arrival of the Diſpenſation from <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> for not obtaining theſe new, impoſſible and
inconſiſtible Conditions, is recalled from his Embaſſy, and a new
Treaty of Marriage between the Prince and the Princeſs <hi>Henrietta
Maria,</hi> youngeſt Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> is as
ſuddenly ſet on Foot, as that of <hi>Spain</hi> abruptly broke off; and that
by this time the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Earl had frequent Advice
of the Prince and Duke's Deſigns to ruin the Earl. The King of
<hi>Spain</hi> therefore made a threefold Proffer to the Earl, either to write
to the King <hi>(James)</hi> and if need were to ſend a particular Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,
to mediate for him, to ſatisfy the Earl's Fidelity and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60932:63"/>
Exactneſs in all the Treaty; or to make him a Blank wherein the
Earl ſhould ſet down his own Conditions both in Title and Honour
in <hi>Spain:</hi> whereunto the Earl anſwered, He was ſorry and afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to hear ſuch Language, and deſir'd they ſhould underſtand,
that neither the King, nor <hi>Spain,</hi> were beholden to him: For
whatever he had done, he thought fit to do for his Maſter's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and his own Honour, having no Relation to <hi>Spain;</hi> and that
he ſerved a Maſter, from whom he was aſſured both of Juſtice
and due Reward; nothing doubting but his own Innocence would
prevail againſt the Wrong intended by his powerful Adverſaries;
and were he ſure to run into eminent Danger, he had rather go
home and caſt himſelf at his Majeſty's Feet and Mercy, and therein
comply with the Duty and Honour of a faithful Subject, though
it ſhould coſt him his Head, than be Duke, or <hi>Infantado</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi>
and that with this Reſolution, he would employ the utmoſt of his
Power to maintain the Amity of the two Crowns, and to ſerve
his Catholick Majeſty: and thirdly, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> deſired him
in private to take 10000 Crowns to bear his Charges; but the Earl
anſwered one would know it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> who would
reveal it to his Majeſty (King <hi>James.)</hi> Now if any Man can ſhew in
any Authority antient or modern, wherein a Treaty of this Nature
was thus begun, thus managed, and thus broken off; wherein a
Noble Lady of higheſt Birth and nobleſt Fortune, adorned with all
the Excellencies of Beauty in her Perſon, and the more excelling
Virtues of her Mind, in all the Perfections requiſite in her Sex,
was thus baulkt, and ſee her ſelf made a Stale, to advance the
Avarice and covetous Deſires of others, he ſhall be my great <hi>Apollo.</hi>
So we'll leave this Affair here, and ſee what Comfort King <hi>James</hi>
had of his Affairs elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1619, King <hi>James,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> States, entred
into, and concluded a Treaty of Trade between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Dutch</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> at this time, and for many Years before,
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had at <hi>Amboyna</hi> (one of the <hi>Scyndae,</hi> or <hi>Setibe</hi> Iſlands
lying near <hi>Seran,</hi> which had ſeveral ſmaller Iſlands depending upon
it) five ſeveral Factories, two at <hi>Hitto</hi> and <hi>Lerico,</hi> and two at
<hi>Latro</hi> and <hi>Cambello,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Seran,</hi> but the principal of
them was at <hi>Amboyna: Amboyna</hi> was, and is the principal Place in
all the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> where Nutmegs, Mace, Cinamon, Cloves and
Spice grow; and from theſe Factories the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſupplied, not
only <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> with Spice, but <hi>Perſia, Japan,</hi> and other
Countries in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Treaty of Commerce between the King and the</hi> Dutch
<hi>States, was ſcarce three Years old, when the</hi> Dutch, <hi>in the</hi> Eaſt-Indies,
<hi>contrive how they may diſpoſſeſs the</hi> Engliſh <hi>of the Spice-Trade,
which above all others, is the beſt in the</hi> Eaſt-Indies, <hi>at

William de Britain, <hi>in his Treatiſe of the</hi> Dutch <hi>Uſurpation,</hi>
fol. 14. that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in all theſe Iſlands were better beloved than
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and had built a Fortreſs in <hi>Amboyna</hi> for the Safety of
Trade, which, the <hi>Dutch</hi> having two Hundred Soldiers there, forced
from the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and thereupon feigning a Plot between the <hi>Engliſh</hi>

Iſlands and Plantations, which they had forced from the <hi>Indians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let's ſee now how highly King <hi>James</hi> reſented theſe things;
he only ſent to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſador, and told him, <hi>He never
heard, nor read a more cruel and impious Act than that of</hi> Amboy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:
<hi>But I do forgive them, and I hope God will, but my Son's Son
ſhall revenge this Blood, and puniſh this horrid Maſſacre;</hi> nor never
further vindicated his own Honour, or his Subjects Blood, and
loſs of their Goods and Trade herein. Whereas about a Year
before, when he heard of the Commons horrid Invaſion upon his
Prerogative, by aſſerting their Rights and Privileges; in a Fury he
diſſolves the Parliament, and ſick as he was, (or ſeemed to be) to
the indangering of his Health, he came in a hurry from <hi>Theobalds,</hi>
called his Council and Judges about him, and <hi>propria Manu</hi> cut
the Commons Proteſtation out of their Journal-Book, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
many of their Members cloſe Priſoners without <hi>Bail</hi> or
<hi>Main-prize,</hi> and baniſhed others.</p>
                  <p>That we may take a better View of the latter end of this Reign,
and the following one of King <hi>Charles,</hi> it will be convenient to
look into <hi>Holland;</hi> and herein obſerve, That <hi>Barnevelt</hi> and the
<hi>Dutch</hi> States, after they had retrieved their Cautionary Towns
from King <hi>James, Barnevelt,</hi> aſſiſted by <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> nouriſhed a
Faction in <hi>Holland,</hi> called the <hi>Arminian,</hi> from <hi>Arminius,</hi> who
maintained 5 Heads, contrary to what <hi>Calvin</hi> had taught in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
which was the Doctrine of the Church ſet up in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the other <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces.</hi> By this Faction thus coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
by <hi>Barnevelt</hi> and <hi>Grotius,</hi> they endeavoured to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<hi>Maurice,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> State-holder, tho he, and his
Father and Uncles were the principal Inſtruments, whereby the
<hi>Dutch</hi> became States: But <hi>Maurice</hi> proved too hard for them, and
cut off <hi>Barnevelt</hi>'s Head, and had hanged <hi>Grotius,</hi> if his Wife had
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60932:64"/>
not conveyed him away in a great Cheſt, pretending it contained
<hi>Arminian</hi> Books: This was in the Year 1620.</p>
                  <p>Tho <hi>Barnevelt</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> propagated the <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenets to
have depoſed the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and advanced their Democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Government, yet the Church-men of <hi>England</hi> who preached
the King's abſolute Power, and exalted his divided Will from
the Laws and Conſtitutions of the Nation, above his Royal Will
in Governing by them, promoted theſe Tenets; and thoſe that
oppoſed them were ſtiled <hi>Puritans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The principal Stickler herein was Dr. <hi>William Laud,</hi> a Man of
a moſt turbulent and aſpiring Diſpoſition; and one of the firſt
Acts for which he was taken notice of, was, to marry the Earl of
<hi>Devonſhire</hi> to the Lady <hi>Rich,</hi> (Mother to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi>
and <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Holland)</hi> when her Husband was alive; but this
was ſo far from advancing him, that the King was highly incenſed
againſt him for it.</p>
                  <p>Yet <hi>Laud</hi>'s aſpiring Humour could not contain him in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
State, but follow the Court he would, yet could never arrive
higher than to be one of the King's Chaplains, by means whereof
he ſometimes got the King's Ear. The King hated the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Government, and had got the Biſhops in <hi>Scotland</hi> to be re-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by three of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops, as a <hi>diſtinct Order,</hi> which
the Kirk in <hi>Scotland</hi> took for an abominable Uſurpation over them;
and alſo in the Year 1618, got the five Articles (commonly called
<hi>The five Articles of</hi> Perth) to be ſettled, as more agreeable to the
Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but this was
to the further Indignation of the Kirk-party: and herein King
<hi>James</hi> ſet up his reſt, as having gained an high Point; but tho
the King hated the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government, yet he oppoſed the
<hi>Arminian Tenets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Arch-biſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> obſerved of him, when he was at Court,
he was <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s only inward Counſellor, ſitting ſometimes
with him privately whole hours, and feeding his Humour with
Malice and Spite; and when he was at <hi>Oxford,</hi> his Buſineſs was
to pick Quarrels in the Lectures of publick Readers, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe
them to the Biſhop of <hi>Durham, Neal,</hi> (the great Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancer
of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenets, and Promoter of the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative)
that he might fill the Ears of King <hi>James</hi> with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
againſt the honeſt Men that took pains in their Places,
and ſettled the Truth (which he called <hi>Puritaniſm)</hi> in their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
As you may read in <hi>Ruſh. fol.</hi> 444.</p>
                  <p>Nor could <hi>Laud</hi> forbear when he could get the King's Ear, but
he urged him more than once, to promote the Doctrine and
Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> after the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the paſſing of the five Articles at <hi>Perth;</hi> this frighted King
<hi>James,</hi> who better knew the Temper of his Country-men, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60932:64"/>
how difficultly he had got the Articles of <hi>Perth</hi> to paſs, that <hi>Laud,</hi>
ignorant of the Temper of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, ſhould be ſo audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to put the King upon this, which might (as it after did)
embroil all <hi>Scotland</hi> in Tumults and Wars, and now becomes more
averſe to <hi>Laua</hi>'s Promotion than before.</p>
                  <p>But this was no Conſideration to <hi>Buckingham;</hi> whether the King
would or nor, <hi>Laud</hi> ſhould riſe: And ſoon after <hi>Williams</hi> was made
Lord Keeper, the Biſhoprick of <hi>St. Davids</hi> fell, and <hi>Buckingham</hi>
reſolved <hi>Laud</hi> ſhould have it; and the Keeper muſt be the Man to
propound it to the King, and receive no Denial. But it's fit to
obſerve here, in what an humbling manner this Promotion was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd
on the part of <hi>Laud;</hi> and take it as it was ſent me by
a Gentleman, with the Atteſtation of Col. <hi>L.</hi> and <hi>R. L.</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who
often heard Mr. <hi>Francis Osburn</hi> ſpeak of it as a certain Truth, and
who had taken notice of it in ſome of his Works not made publick.
As ſoon as <hi>Laud</hi> had Information that the foreſaid Biſhoprick was
vacant, he haſtens to wait upon the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> for that
Preferment, but found the Duke was not ſtirring; but being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
of Delay, prevails upon one of the Duke's Gentlemen to
acquaint him he had earneſt Buſineſs with his Grace, and begged
immediate Admittance; which being granted, the Doctor enters
his Grace's Chamber, and finds him a-bed with a Whore: the
Duke asks his Buſineſs; <hi>Laud</hi> told him, the Biſhop of <hi>St. Davids</hi>
was dead, and that he came to beg his Grace to recommend him
to the King for the vacant See. The Duke told him, that he had
been repreſented to him as the proudeſt Man alive, and therefore
he could not, in Honour, recommend him to the King: <hi>Laud</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
his Grace, that what had been ſaid of him upon that Head,
was utterly falſe, and the effect of Malice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for he was ſo far
acquainted with himſelf, as that he knew himſelf to be the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
Man alive: I'll try that preſently, ſays the Duke, and ſo as a
Teſtimony of his great Humility, orders him, Spaniel-like, to take
ſeveral Turns over and under the Bed, (his Grace, and his Whore
all the while lying in it) which he did to Content; and when
'twas over, Well, ſays the Duke, now I believe you, and you ſhall
have the Biſhoprick of <hi>St. Davids. Williams,</hi> who knew the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
of the Seal was as <hi>Buckingham</hi> pleaſed, durſt do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than become <hi>Laud</hi>'s Advocate to the King; but the King was
at firſt utterly averſe from it, giving <hi>Laud</hi>'s Marriage of the Lady
<hi>Rich,</hi> and his urging the King not to reſt at the five Articles of
<hi>Perth,</hi> for ſome Reaſons: but the Keeper perſiſting, and alledging
how ſorry <hi>Laud</hi> was for theſe, the King at laſt ſaid, <hi>And is there
no hoe, but you will carry it! then take him to you; but on my Soul
you will repent it;</hi> and ſo went away in Anger, uſing other fierce
and ominous Words, which were divulged in Court, and are too
tart to be repeated, as you may read, <hi>fol. 64. tit.</hi> 75. in the Life
of Archbiſhop <hi>Williams.</hi>
                  </p>

It's obſervable, that Benefits conferred upon Ambitious Men,
never create any Obligation of Gratitude; on the contrary, ill Men
generally turn the Benefits received, to the Ruin and Overthrow
of their Benefactors: More likely Inſtances hereof are rarely to be
found than in <hi>Laud</hi> and <hi>Buckingham;</hi> this having received his firſt
Admiſſion into the King's Favour by the Mediation of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
to the Queen <hi>Ann,</hi> none elſe being able to perſwade her to
it; yet before the Arch-biſhop could bring the Queen to it, ſhe
often told him, <hi>My Lord, You and the rest of your Friends know not
what you do; I know your Maſter (the King) better than you all:
for if this young Man be once brought in, the first Perſons that he will
plague must be you that labour for him; yea, I ſhall have my part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
the King will teach him to deſpiſe and hardly intreat us all, that
he may be beholden to none but himſelf;</hi> as you may read in his
own Narrative in <hi>Ruſhworth,</hi> from <hi>fol.</hi> 438, to <hi>fol.</hi> 461.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Laud</hi>'s Contrivance to ruin <hi>Williams</hi> after Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi>
takes up almoſt a Volume, reported by the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield,</hi>
and by what villanous Inſtruments, Perjuries, Subornation, and
keeping back of Witneſſes, expunging and razing Records, and by
diſplacing Sir <hi>Robert Heath</hi> from being Lord Chief Juſtice, becauſe
he would not do <hi>Laud</hi>'s Drudgery, and bringing in Sir <hi>John Finch,</hi>
who would <hi>jurare in Verba Magiſtri,</hi> as well as throw down the
Bounds of the Foreſts to make the King's Subjects Inheritances to
be a Prey to wild Beaſts: yet after <hi>Laud</hi> had perpetrated all theſe,
he confeſt he never read the Commiſſion by which he acted. See
the ſecond Part of the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s Life.</p>
                  <p>However, <hi>Laud</hi> could make no great Progreſs of his Malice
againſt the Keeper in the Shortneſs of the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi>
after he became Biſhop: for the King had the Keeper's Parts and
Learning in high Eſteem, tho <hi>Buckingham</hi> both hated and feared
the Keeper for them, no great ſign of a wiſe Stateſman, (ſee
the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield</hi>'s Life of Arch-biſhop <hi>Williams, Part 1.
fol. 148. tit. 156.)</hi> and had ſo little Wit as to ſay ſo: Yet <hi>Laud,</hi>
now a Biſhop, from a Stickler and Informer againſt thoſe who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
the <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenets, now becomes a Patron and Promoter
of them; all Court-Favour now looked that way, and the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
of them were diſcountenanced, and ranked in the Degree of
<hi>Puritans;</hi> all the Youth generally ran that way, and the Schools
in both Univerſities rung loud upon thoſe Tenets, and from thence
were diſperſed into all Parts of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The King having ſpent the two Subſidies granted in Parliament,
and the Benevolence, which he had by his own Authority raiſed
all over <hi>England,</hi> for the Recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> upon the
Prince's Expedition into <hi>Spain; Buckingham,</hi> to his Project of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Dean and Chapters Lands, propounds the Sale of all the
Crown-Lands: but this meeting with many Difficulties, and being
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60932:65"/>
diſſwaded from the farther Proſecution of it, by the powerful Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of my Lord Keeper <hi>Williams;</hi> there was now no other means
left to get Money, but by calling a Parliament: And now <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
courts the popular Humour, and appears moſt forward for to
make appear in Parliament the Reaſons which induced him to
perſwade the Prince to break off from the Match with <hi>Spain;</hi> which
tho it took at preſent, yet it was but ſhort-lived, for the Treaty
of the Marriage between the Prince and Daughter of <hi>France</hi> ſpoil'd
all: But this was not known during the ſitting of the Parliament,
which met upon the 16th of <hi>February 1623-24.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We hear of no Proclamation now againſt talking of State-Affairs,
the debating of them in Parliament is not <hi>Sutor ultra crepidam;</hi> on
the contrary, the King, in his firſt Speech to them the <hi>19th</hi> of
<hi>February,</hi> tells them, <hi>He craves their Advice, and that he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
with them in Matters concerning his Eſtate and Dignity, and that
he had ever endeavoured, by this and the like ways, to procure and
cheriſh the Love of his People towards him: So he does hope, and his
Hope exceeded by Faith, that never any King was more beloved by his
People,</hi> &amp;c. Let any Man compare this with what the King ſaid
and did laſt Parliament, and after, and judg of the Sincerity of
this part of the King's Speech, eſpecially when he remembred
himſelf better, when in his laſt Speech to this Parliament, he
boaſted he had broken the Necks of three Parliaments, which were
all that were in his Reign, but this.</p>
                  <p>But theſe were but Generals, of which he complains; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
having learn'd it of his Scholar <hi>Buckingham,</hi> in particular
he asks their free Counſels <hi>in the Match of his Son;</hi> the debating
of which, laſt Parliament, gave him ſo great Offence. Now at
this time the King had broke off the Match in <hi>Spain,</hi> and was
treating another with <hi>France,</hi> which was greedily entertained in the
<hi>French</hi> Court, and ſome Progreſs made in it; of which the King
never, that I can find, or do believe, mentioned one word to the
Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The next Particular which the King communicated to them was
of his Scholar, but now his Maſter, <hi>Buckingham,</hi> (in whom he
(the King) ever repoſed the moſt Truſt of his Perſon) that he
ſhould be ever preſent with the Prince in <hi>Spain,</hi> and never leave
him till he returned again ſafely to him; which he did, tho not
with that Effect of the Buſineſs expected, yet not without Profit;
for it taught him (the King) this point of Wiſdom, <hi>Qui verſatur
in generalibus</hi> is eaſily deceived, and that Generality brings nothing
to good Iſſue, but that before any Matter can be fully finiſhed, it
muſt be brought to Particulars; for when he thought the Affair
had been, before their going, reduced to a narrow point, (but
there is no point in Generalities) relying upon their general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
(of which I do not find neither the King, nor the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60932:66"/>
Prince, or <hi>Buckingham</hi> after him named one) he found, when
they came there, the Matter proved ſo raw, as if it had never been
treated of, they generally giving them eaſy way to evade, and
affording them means to avoid the effecting any thing. But it
ſeems there were Particulars which the King would not then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
but left them to the Prince and <hi>Buckingham</hi> to relate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As for a Toleration of the</hi> Roman <hi>Religion, As God ſhall judg
him, he ſaid, he never thought, nor meant, nor never in word
expreſſed any thing that ſavoured of it.</hi> How was Arch-biſhop <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot</hi>
miſtaken, when he wrote his diſſwaſive Letter againſt the King's
Proclamation for the Toleration of Religion to <hi>Roman Catholicks?</hi> See
<hi>Ruſhworth,</hi> fol. 85. And how was my Lord Keeper <hi>Williams</hi> miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
after the King had directed him and other Commiſſioners to draw
up a Pardon for all Offences past by <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> with a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
for thoſe to come, obnoxious to any Laws against Recuſants;
and then to iſſue forth two general Commands under the Great Seal,
the one to all <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Juſtices</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and the other to all <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
Chancellors,</hi> and <hi>Commiſſaries,</hi> not to execute any Statute
against them; and tho the Keeper past the Pardon as fully and amply
as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> could deſire to pen it, yet the Keeper put ſome ſtop to the
vaſt Prohibition to the <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> for the Reaſons he gave?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Becauſe the publiſhing of this <hi>General Indulgence</hi> at one
puſh, may beget a general Diſcontent, if not a Mutiny; but the
inſtilling thereof into the Peoples knowledg by little and little, by
the Favours done to Catholicks, might indeed looſen the Tongues
of a few particular Perſons, who might hear of their Neighbours
Pardon, and having vented their Diſlike, would afterward cool
again; and ſo his Majeſty might by degrees with more convenience
enlarge his Favours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe to ſorbid the Judges againſt their Oaths, and
the Juſtices of Peace, who are likewiſe ſworn to execute the Laws
of the Land, is a thing unprecedented in this Kingdom, and would
be a harſh and bitter Pill to be digeſted without ſome Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:
But this Delay diſguſted the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador; which
you may read in <hi>Ruſhworth, fol.</hi> 101.</p>
                  <p>And as God was his Judg, he never thought, nor meant, nor
ever in Word expreſſed any thing that ſavoured of a Toleration
of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion: So God was his Judg, and he ſpake as a
Chriſtian King. Never any wayfaring Man that was in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts
of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and in danger of Death for want of Water to
quench his Thirſt, more deſired Water, than he did thirſt and
deſire the good and comfortable Succeſs of his Parliament, and
Bleſſing upon their Counſels, that the good Iſſue of this may
expiate and acquit the fruitleſs Iſſue of the former, and prayed
God their Counſels may advance Religion and the publick Weal,
and they of him and his Children. You may read the Speech at
large in <hi>Ruſhworth, fol.</hi> 115, 116, 117.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:60932:66"/>
But tho the King gloried that he had ever endeavoured to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
and cheriſh the Love of his People to him, which the Lords
and Commons did repreſent; yet the Commons could remember
a time not out of mind with the King; for they choſe that honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Gentleman Sir <hi>Thomas Crew</hi> (newly returned from his Exile
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> whither the King had ſent him, as one of the ill-tempered
Spirits who adviſed him againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match, and
preſumed to aſſert the Privileges of the Commons) for their
Speaker.</p>
                  <p>After the Ceremonies of Opening the Parliament, and the Choice
of a Speaker was over, the firſt thing that appeared upon the
Stage of Affairs, was the Narrative of the Proceedings in the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Match, made by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and aſſiſted by the
Prince: Which you may read at large in <hi>Ruſhworth,</hi> from <hi>fol.</hi> 119,
to 125.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not deſcant upon this long Narrative, but leave the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
of it to the Earl of <hi>Briſtol;</hi> but only take notice of the
Preamble of the third Article of the Duke's Narrative, and the
latter part of the fourth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Preamble of the third Article is,</hi> It is fit to obſerve this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
which is the thing whereupon all his Highneſs's (the Prince's)
ſubſequent Actions did depend: He had never ſtaid a Sennight longer
in <hi>Spain;</hi> he had never left any Proxy with <hi>Briſtol;</hi> he had never
taken the Oath at the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> or ever ſo much as have written a
Letter of Compliment to the Lady, but that he had ſtill before his
Eyes, as his Cynoſure, the Promiſe made by the <hi>Conde (I think the
Duke meant</hi> Olivares) for the Reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why was this Treaty between King <hi>James</hi> and the <hi>Conde?</hi> Or
if the Reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> were the Foundation upon
which the whole Treaty moved, Why was it not ſo much as
mentioned in all the Treaty, ſo ſolemnly ſworn to by both
Kings, the Prince, and <hi>Buckingham</hi> himſelf? Nay, King <hi>James</hi>
himſelf, by two ſeveral Expreſſes to the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the firſt
of the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1621. and the other of the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>December
1623.</hi> commanded him, That he ſhould not make the Buſineſs of
the <hi>Palatinate</hi> a Condition of the Marriage; as you may read in
<hi>Ruſhworth, fol.</hi> 302.</p>
                  <p>For the better underſtanding of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Narrative in the
fourth Article, it is fit to take notice, That the Reaſon in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
for not purſuing the Proxies of the Marriage ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſworn to by the Prince, and <hi>Buckingham</hi> himſelf, was not for
the Reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> but (forſooth) for fear the
<hi>Infanta</hi> might retire into a Cloiſter, and ſo deprive the Prince of
a Wife; tho the <hi>Infanta,</hi> ſo far as the Gravity of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
would permit, ever expreſſed an entire Affection to the Prince:
ſo that when the Prince took leave of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> ſhe ſeemed to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60932:67"/>
deliver up her Heart to him, in as high Expreſſions as that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
and her Learning could with her Honour ſet forth: for
when the Prince told her, <hi>His Heart would never be out of Anxiety,
till ſhe had paſſed the intended Voyage, and were ſafe on the Britiſh
Land;</hi> ſhe anſwered, with a modeſt Bluſh, <hi>That if ſhe were in
danger upon the Ocean, or diſcompoſed with the rolling brackiſh Waves,
ſhe ſhould chear up her ſelf, and remember all the way, to whom ſhe
was going:</hi> As you may read in the Life of <hi>Williams</hi> Lord Keeper,
<hi>fol. 161. tit.</hi> 168. And Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth, fol.</hi> 104. ſays, She cauſed
many divine Duties to be performed for the Prince's Return.</p>
                  <p>In the Proxies left with the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> there was a Clauſe
inſerted, <hi>De non revocando procuratore;</hi> as much as to ſay, <hi>irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable:</hi>
And becauſe the Earl did in his Letter to the Prince, of
the Firſt of <hi>November</hi> in 1623, preſs this vehemently to the
Prince, the Prince vowed openly before both Houſes, that he had
never by Oath nor Honour engaged himſelf not to revoke thoſe
Powers, more than by the Clauſe <hi>De non revocando procuratore,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
in the Inſtrument it ſelf; and then he conceived the Clauſe
to be matter of Form, and tho eſſentially of no binding Power,
yet uſually thruſt into every ſuch Inſtrument; and that the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
hold, That it is lawful by the Civil and Canon Law, for any
Man to revoke his Proxy of Marriage, notwithſtanding it hath the
Clauſe <hi>De non revocando procuratore</hi> inſerted in it: Therefore the
Duke concluded, as to this point, That the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> in
charging this Matter ſo highly upon the Prince, had much forget
himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Can any Man believe, that when the Prince made the Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and his Brother, to his Eſpouſals with
the <hi>Infanta</hi> in his Name, and left it in the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi>'s hands,
with the Clauſe <hi>De non revocando procuratore,</hi> that he then had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
with the <hi>Civilians,</hi> that he might revoke it when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
or that this Marriage, nine Years in treating, was not
founded upon the Honour and Oaths of the Kings, the Prince, and
of <hi>Buckingham</hi> himſelf, but upon the Niceties and Quirks of the
<hi>Civilians?</hi> Or did it become the Prince, or the Duke either, who
when he parted from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> at the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> ſolemnly
to ſwear the Treaty of Marriage, and the Furtherance of it by all
that was in his Power, in the preſence of the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and
Sir <hi>Walter Aſhton,</hi> as you may read in <hi>Ruſhworth, fol.</hi> 285. and
now in the face of the King and Parliament, to plead a Nicety of
the <hi>Civilians,</hi> to abſolve the Prince and himſelf? Now let us ſee
what the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> ſays for himſelf, for the Duke's Charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him for Proceedings upon this Match. His Reaſons were,</p>
                  <p>1. For that he had a Warrant under the Prince's hand, for his
Proceedings to conſummate the Match.</p>
                  <p>2. It was the main Scope of his Embaſſy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:60932:67"/>
3. He was enjoined by the King and Prince's Commiſſion under
the Great Seal.</p>
                  <p>4. He had poſitive Orders under his Majeſty's hand (King
<hi>James)</hi> ſince.</p>
                  <p>5. It was agreed by Capitulation, that it ſhould be within ſo
many days after the coming of the Diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p>6. The King <hi>(James)</hi> and Prince ſignified by their Letters to
him, at the ſame time when they diſcharged him of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
touching the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s entring into Religion, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to proceed in the Marriage; which Letters bear date the
<hi>8th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1623.</p>
                  <p>7. The <hi>Proxies</hi> were to that end left in his hands; and after
again renewed, after the Prince's return into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. That he (the Earl) had overthrown the Marriage without
Order; for tho Sir <hi>Walter Aſton</hi> and himſelf had uſed all poſſible
means for gaining time, and deferring the Deſponſories, yet the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> cauſed it to be proteſted, that in caſe the Earl ſhould
inſiſt upon the deferring the Deſponſories, he would free himſelf
from the Treaty by the Earl's infringing the Capitulations: And in
truth, altho the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould have condeſcended to have
prolonged the Deſponſories until one of the Days of <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> as
by the Letter was required; yet the Prince's <hi>Proxies</hi> had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that time expired, and he durſt not, without a preciſe War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
put ſuch a Scorn upon ſo noble a Lady, whom he then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
was like to have been the Prince's Wife, as to nominate a
Day of Marriage, when the <hi>Proxies</hi> were out of date, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
had ſworn to the Treaty.</p>
                  <p>9. He (the Earl) could not, in Honour and Honeſty, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to perform that publick Truſt repoſed in him, when the
<hi>Proxies</hi> were depoſited in his hands, with publick and legal Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
with an Inſtrument by a Secretary of State to the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> leading and directing the Uſe of them: and the ſame being
then <hi>Inſtrumentum Stipulatum,</hi> wherein as well the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
was intereſted by the Acceptation of the Subſtitution, as the
Prince by granting the <hi>Proxies;</hi> he could not in Honeſty fail the
publick Truſt without clear and undoubted Warrant; which, ſo
ſoon as he had, he obeyed. See <hi>Ruſhworth, fol.</hi> 301, 302.</p>
                  <p>The Duke's ſtating the Queſtion, <hi>ſuper totam materiam,</hi> was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether this, being the full Effect and Product of this Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
he had opened to them (the Parliament) be ſufficient,
<hi>ſuper totam materiam,</hi> for his Majeſt to rely upon, with any Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as well for the Marriage of his only Son, as for the Relief of
his only Daughter? Or, that theſe Treaties ſet aſide, his Majeſty
were beſt to truſt in his own Strength, and to ſtand upon his
own Feet? So the Duke ended, That if the bringing us from
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60932:68"/>
Darkneſs to Light, did deſerve any Thanks, we muſt wholly aſcribe
it to his Highneſs the Prince.</p>
                  <p>Here is a Tale finely told, <hi>parte inaudita altera;</hi> but the Duke
ſhall hear more of it, and indeed it was a Net ſo ſpread in the
ſight of every Bird, that it was a wonder it ſhould catch any: for
at this time the Match was quite broke off with <hi>Spain,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
entered upon with <hi>France,</hi> when it muſt be ſupoſed, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth,
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match was in Treaty, and now muſt be broken
off by Advice in Parliament, which was before ſuch a Myſtery of
State as not to be meddled with in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>But while the Prince and Duke were wrapt up in ſecurity of
the Parliament, as well as the King's Affections, and that now the
Duke was become as well the Peoples as the King's Favourite, a
new Accident happened, out of which, if the Prince and Duke
had not been extricated by the matchleſs Wit and lively Induſtry
of the Keeper, in all appearance it would have put both Prince
and Duke out of the King's Favour and Affections, diſſolved this
beloved Parliament, and have brought ſuch a train of miſchievous
Conſequences as could not have been foreſeen, or prevented. I
deſire to be excuſed if I do not cite the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield</hi>'s
words in the Life of the Lord Keeper, for I think the Caſe will
more clearly appear without his Paraphraſes and Gloſſes.</p>
                  <p>While the Marriage between the Prince and <hi>Infanta</hi> was in
Treaty, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſent <hi>Don John,</hi> Marqueſs <hi>Inoioſa,</hi> his
Ambaſſador to be reſident in <hi>England;</hi> a Man of true <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
and Severity, and a moſt rigid Promoter of the Popiſh Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in <hi>England;</hi> ſo that he was taken notice of to be the moſt
ſurly and unpleaſing Man that ever came to the Keeper about any
Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>If this Man were thus during the Treaty, it could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
he would become better natur'd upon the breaking of it;
and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was as jealous of him, that he ſhould
ſpoil the Narrative he had made of the Proceedings in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Match, as he was of the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and therefore would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
admit the Marqueſs to have any private Audience of the King
in the Duke's Abſence; ſo that Sir <hi>Walter Aſton</hi> wrote from <hi>Spain,</hi>
that it was complained of, that Marqueſs <hi>Inoioſa</hi> had advertiſed thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had not been able to procure a private Audience of the
King tho he often deſired it, but what the Duke aſſiſted at.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Inoioſa,</hi> impatient of any longer Delay, about the latter end of
<hi>April</hi> 1624, contrived this Expedient to put the following Paper
into the King's Hand; he and <hi>Don Carlo de Colonna</hi> came adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and whilſt <hi>Don Carlo</hi> held the Prince and Duke
in earneſt Diſcourſe, <hi>Inoioſa</hi> put this Paper into the King's Hand
with a Wink, that the King ſhould put it into his Pocket, wherein,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:60932:68"/>
1. He terrifies the King, that he was not, or could not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Paſſages either of his own Court, or of the
Parliament, for he was kept from all faithful Servants that would
inform him by the Miniſters of the Prince and Duke, and that he
was a Priſoner as much as King <hi>John</hi> of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> or King
<hi>Francis</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and could not be ſpoken with, but before ſuch
as watched him.</p>
                  <p>2. That there was a ſtrong and violent Machination in hand,
which had turned the Prince, a moſt obedient Son, to a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Courſe to his Majeſty's Intentions.</p>
                  <p>3. That the Council began laſt Summer at <hi>Madrid,</hi> but was
lately reſolved on in <hi>England,</hi> to reſtrain his Majeſty from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of the Government of his Kingdoms; and that the Prince
and Duke had deſigned ſuch Commiſſioners under themſelves, as
ſhould intend great Affairs, and the Publick Good.</p>
                  <p>4. That this ſhould be effected by beginning of a War, and
keeping ſome Companies on foot in this Land, whereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
his Majeſty to yield to any thing, chiefly being brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Straits for want of Monies to pay the Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>5. That the Prince and Duke's incloſing his Majeſty from the
ſaid Ambaſſador, and other of his own Loyal People, that they
might not come near in private, did argue in them a fear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
of a good Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>6. That the Emiſſaries of the Duke had brought his Majeſty
into Contempt with the potent Men of this Realm, traducing him
for ſlothful and unactive, for addiction to an inglorious Peace,
while the Inheritance of his Daughter and her Children is in the
Hands of his Foes; and this appear'd by a Letter which the Duke
had writ into <hi>Holland,</hi> and they had intercepted.</p>
                  <p>7. That his Majeſty's Honour, nay his Crown and Safety, did
depend upon a ſudden Diſſolution of the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>8. They loaded the Duke with ſundry Miſdemeanours in <hi>Spain,</hi>
and his violent Oppoſition to the Match.</p>
                  <p>9. That the Duke had divulged the King's Secrets, and the
cloſe Deſigns between his Majeſty and their Maſter King <hi>Philip,</hi>
about the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and their Provinces, and laboured to
put his Majeſty out of the good Opinion of the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. That the Duke was guilty of moſt corrupt dealing with the
Ambaſſadors of divers Princes.</p>
                  <p>11. That all theſe things were carried on in the Parliament with
an head-ſtrong Violence, and that the Duke was the cauſe of it,
who courted them only that were of troubled Humours.</p>
                  <p>12. That ſuch Bitterneſs and Ignominies were vented in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as were againſt all good Manners
and Honour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:60932:69"/>
The <hi>13th</hi> is a flat Contradiction to the Precedents, wherein they
made the Prince privy to dangerous things; yet in this they ſay,
<hi>That the Puritans</hi> (of whom the Duke was Head) <hi>did wiſh they
could bring it about, that the Succeſſion of the Kingdom might come
to the Prince</hi> Palatine <hi>and his Children, in right of the Lady</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</p>
                  <p>In a <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> the Paper prayed the King, That <hi>Don Franciſco
Carondelet,</hi> Secretary to the Marqueſs <hi>Inoioſa,</hi> might be brought to
the King, when the Prince and Duke were ſitting in the Lords
Houſe, to ſatisfy ſuch Doubts as the King might raiſe, which was
performed by the Earl of <hi>Kelly,</hi> who watch'd a fit Seaſon at one
time for <hi>Franciſco,</hi> and for <hi>Padre Maeſtro</hi> a Jeſuit at another time,
who told their Errand ſo ſpitefully, that the King was troubled at
their Relations.</p>
                  <p>How far the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador <hi>Carondelet,</hi> and the Jeſuit
<hi>Maeſtro,</hi> could make good this Paper, I cannot tell, nor does the
Biſhop ſay; however the King was apprehenſive, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was ſolicitous to engage him in a War for the <hi>Palatinate;</hi>
which he ſo dreaded, that, as the Biſhop ſays, he thought ſcarce
any Miſchief was ſo great as was worth a War to mend it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Prince did deviate from him, as likewiſe in his Affection
to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Alliance: But he ſtuck at the Duke more, whom
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e defended in one part to one of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, yet at
the ſame time complaining, <hi>That he had noted in him a turbule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>
Spirit of late, and knew not how to mitigate it, ſo that caſting up the
Sum he doubted it might come to his turn to pay the Reckoning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Thoughts ſo wrought upon the King, that his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
fell ſuddenly, that he muſed much in Silence, and that he
entertained the Prince and Duke with myſtical and broken Speeches:
this nettled them both, and enquiring the Reaſon, they could not
go further, than that they heard the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Secretary and the
Jeſuit <hi>Maeſtro</hi> had been with the King, and underſtood that ſome
in the Ambaſſador's Houſe had vaunted, that they had nettled
the Duke, and that a Train would take fire ſhortly to blow up the
Parliament.</p>
                  <p>In this Perplexity the King prepared to take Coach for <hi>Windſor,</hi>
to ſhift Ground for ſome better Reſt in this Unreſt, and took
Coach at St. <hi>James</hi>'s Gate, and the Prince with him, and found
a ſlight Errand to leave <hi>Buckingham</hi> behind; as the King was put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Foot into the Coach, the Duke beſought him, with Tears
in his Eyes, and humble Prayer, that his Majeſty would let him
know what could be laid to his Charge to offend ſo good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
a Maſter, and vowed by the Name of his Saviour he would
purge it, or confeſs it: The King did not ſatisfy him, but breathed
out his Diſguſt, that he was the unhappieſt alive to be forſaken
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60932:69"/>
of them that were deareſt to him, which was uttered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with Tears from his own Eyes, as well as the Prince's and
Duke's, and made haſte to <hi>Windſor,</hi> leaving the Duke behind:
this was upon <hi>Saturday</hi> at the end of <hi>April.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke forlorn, retires to <hi>Wallingford-Houſe,</hi> and was in ſuch
Confuſion and Diſtraction, that when my Lord Keeper, (who had
notice of all theſe things, and was more careful of the Duke
than he could be of himſelf) came to him, he found the Duke
lying upon his Couch, in that immoveable Poſture, that he would
neither riſe up nor ſpeak, tho the Keeper invited him to it twice
or thrice by courteous Queſtions. The Keeper told him by the
Faith of a deep Proteſtation, that he came purpoſely to prevent
more Harm, and to bring him out of that Sorrow into the Light
of the King's Favour; <hi>That he verily believ'd God's directing Hand
was in it, to ſtir up his Grace to advance him to thoſe Favours, which he
poſſeſſed, to do him Service at this Pinch of Extremity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Keeper beſought the Duke to make haſte to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and
to ſhew himſelf to the King before Supper was ended; to deport
himſelf with all amiable Addreſſes, and not to ſtir from him Day
nor Night, for the Danger was, that ſome would thruſt themſelves
to puſh on the King to break up the Parliament; and the next
degree of their Hope was, upon the Diſſolution of the Parliament
to ſee his Grace committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and then God knows
what would follow; the Keeper beſought him to be ſecret, and be
quick and judicious in the Prevention: More might not be ſaid,
becauſe the Loſs of Time might loſe all. The Duke thankt him,
and made haſte to <hi>Windſor</hi> before he was lookt for, and was as inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
from the King as his Shadow.</p>
                  <p>The Fineneſs of the Keeper's Wit, in unriddling this Myſtery,
is equal to that of <hi>Cicero,</hi> in finding out the Bottom of <hi>Catiline</hi>'s
Conſpiracy; and by like means, <hi>viz.</hi> by Women, tho after a
different manner: For <hi>Fulvia</hi> of her own accord diſcovered <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi>'s
Conſpiracy, in Spite and Emulation to <hi>Sempronia;</hi> but the
Keeper bribed one of <hi>Fulvia</hi>'s Stamp, to get an Inſight into this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
which ſo perplext the King.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems to me that the Prince and Duke had a Jealouſy that the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador might infuſe ſomething into the Keeper,
which might ſpoil the Narrative which the Duke made in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match; and therefore the Keeper had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
expreſs Orders, that neither the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, nor any
of his Train, or Followers, ſhould come at him, whereby the
Keeper had been ſecluded for a Month from any Intelligence from
thence.</p>
                  <p>But before, <hi>Don Franciſco Carondelet,</hi> the Ambaſſador's Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
was frequently at the Keeper's; he was contrary to the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador,

managed the Secretary, that he could keep no Secret from her
which ſhe would have had made known: With her the Keeper
held Correſpondence, and preſented her bountifully, though he
told the Prince he had never ſeen her; and by her the Keeper
had the rough Draught of the De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>gn of the Paper which the
Ambaſſador had put into the King's Hands: The Keeper had alſo
notice of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prieſt, who lived in <hi>Drury-lane,</hi> which the
Secretary loved above any other, and was dearer to him than his
own Confeſſor, but whether the Keeper came to the Knowledge of
this by the Lady in <hi>Mark-lane,</hi> or from the Secretary himſelf, the
Biſhop does not ſay.</p>
                  <p>The Commons had drawn up a Remonſtrance againſt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
which the Prieſts aſſumed, which the King called a Sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one, and which put the Prieſts into a great Terror; and in
this Terror, he ſent his Purſevant Captain <hi>Toothbie,</hi> to ſeize the
Prieſt in <hi>Mark-lane,</hi> and not to commit him to Priſon, but to keep
him at his own Houſe till further Order.</p>
                  <p>The Secretary ſoon heard of this, and was confounded what
to do for the Prieſt's Delivery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he knew no other means to do it,
but by my Lord Keeper, and from him he was baniſhed; yet in
this Extremity, he ſent to the Keeper, to beg of him to ſee his

however if the Secretary came about eleven of the Clock at Night,

                  <p>When the Secretary came into the Keeper's Preſence, he told

                     <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſays <hi>Franciſco,</hi> (accenting his Words with paſſionate
Geſture) <hi>let not the Dread of this Parliament trouble you, for I can
tell you, if you have not heard it, that it is upon Expiration:</hi> and then
the Keeper pickt out of him the Heads of the Articles in the Paper
the Ambaſſador had given the King, with all the Reaſons, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
and diſtorted Proofs and Expoſitions to confirm them;
and about two in the Morning diſmiſt the Secretary, and ordered
the Purſevant to releaſe the Prieſt, with Caution that he ſhould
croſs the Seas that Day, or the next.</p>
                  <p>The Keeper was as happy in his Memory, as in his Wit and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention;
for after the Secretary was gone, he neither ſlept, nor
ſtirred out of the Room, till he had digeſted all the Secretary had
told him in Writing, with his Obſervations upon each Particular;
and when he had trimmed up a fair Copy, (but what it was the
Biſhop ſays not) he carried it to the Prince at St. <hi>James</hi>'s: This
was upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> morning, after the King went to <hi>Windſor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prince read the Charges, and admired at the Virulency
of them; with the Antiſcripts of the Keeper, which were much
commended, whereupon he cauſed his Coach to be made ready;
but before he went, the Keeper humbly begg'd of him to conceal
the Matter for two Reaſons: Firſt, for ſearching into the King's
Counſels, which he would not ſhould be opened: Secondly, that
when he had found them out, to diſcover them, tho to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
which the Prince promiſed, and then went to <hi>Windſor.</hi> When he
came there, he called for the Duke, and ſhewed him the Paper pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
with the Apology in the other Column: the Duke humbly
thankt the Prince, that his Caſe was interwoven with his Highneſs,
and their double Vindication put into one Frame; and beſought
the Prince to know what <hi>Vitruvius</hi> had compacted a Piece of
Architecture of ſuch Vicinity in ſo ſhort a time, but could not
obtain it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So they forthwith deſired a private Hearing of the King,
and gave the Schedule to his Majeſty's Conſideration; the
King read it deliberately, and at many Stops ſaid,</hi> 'twas well,
very well, <hi>and drew the Prince and Duke near to him, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
them both, proteſting he ſorrowed much, that he had
aggrieved them, with a Jealouſy fomented by no better than
Traitors:</hi> And that you may know, ſaid the King, how little you
ſhall pay me for Reconciliation, I ask no more but to tell me who is
your Ingineer, that ſtruck theſe Sparks out of the Flint to light the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
to find the Groat which was loſt. <hi>The Prince ſtood mute, and
the Duke vowed,</hi> he knew not the Author. Well, <hi>ſaid the King,</hi>
I have a good Noſtril, and will anſwer mine own Queſtion; my Keeper
had the main finger in it, I dare ſwear he bolted the Flower, and made
it up into Paſt. Sir, <hi>ſaid the Prince,</hi> I was precluded, by my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
not to reveal him, but I never promiſed to tell a Lie for him;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60932:71"/>
your Majeſty has hit the Man: And God do him good for it, <hi>ſays the
King;</hi> I need not tell you both what you owe him for this Service; he
has done himſelf this Right with me, that I diſcern his Sufficiency more
and more. <hi>This you may read in the Keeper's Life,</hi> Part 1. <hi>from</hi>
fol. 195, <hi>to</hi> fol. 200. <hi>and much more of the Biſhop, but I think
but little more of the Keeper. And tho the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Ambaſſador re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a ſore Rebuke here, and was ſent back into</hi> Spain, <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
ſays he received no Frown nor Disfavour there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let's ſee how the Duke requited the Keeper for his Service,
which was but in <hi>May:</hi> In the beginning of <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Term fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
the Duke perſwaded my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hobart</hi> to tell
the King, or give it under his hand, that my Lord Keeper was not
fit for the Place, and he would undertake to caſt the Keeper out,
and put my Lord <hi>Hobart</hi> into his place; but my Lord <hi>Hobart</hi> ſaid,
<hi>Somewhat might have been ſaid at first, but he ſhould do my Lord
Keeper great wrong that ſaid ſo now.</hi> See <hi>fol.</hi> 201.</p>
                  <p>However, ſuch was the Temper of the Times, that both Houſes
chimed in with the Duke in his Narrative, and juſtified him againſt
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, who took great Offence at the Duke's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as reflecting upon his Maſter's Honour, and demanded his
Head for Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The King was ſo pleaſed with the Parliament's Juſtification of
the Duke, as we have ſhewed before, that as he had been his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
<hi>Somerſet</hi>'s Advocate, to plead his Cauſe againſt the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> to make the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to be <hi>virgo

<hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Advocate, to make him a Favourite to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and becauſe of the Excellency and veracity of his Speech,
which ſhould diſpoſe the Nation to it, we'll give it you <hi>verbatim,</hi>
as it is to be ſeen in <hi>Ruſhworth, fol.</hi> 127.</p>

run his Head into the Yoke with the People here for underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                  <p>Did ever any old experienced King (as he ſtiles himſelf) ſo
dote upon a young, raw, and unexperienced Gentleman, (bred up
in no ſort of Learning or Buſineſs, and ſcarce before he became a
Courtier, unleſs in his Infancy, breathed any other than <hi>French</hi>

told by the Duke, to the Offence not only of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
converſant in the whole Affair, but alſo without hearing the
Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> who was the greateſt Stateſman of <hi>England,</hi> if not
in <hi>Europe,</hi> and who had ſo honourably performed ſeveral Embaſſies,
to the Honour of the King, ſo far as the thing would bear, and ſo
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60932:72"/>
manifoldly owned by the King? That this Scholar of the King's,
unacquainted with the Treaty, ſhould break in upon the Earl, and
not only unravel all, but quarrel with him, and in another King's
Court with the prime Miniſter of State, by whom he might beſt
have attained his End, if he deſigned any.</p>
                  <p>However, the Parliament addreſs themſelves to the King, and
repreſent to him, That he cannot in Honour proceed in the Treaty
of the Match with <hi>Spain,</hi> nor the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> and the Commons
offer the King three Subſidies and three Fifteenths, for carrying
on the War for the Recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> in caſe the King
will break off the Treaties: which the King accepted, proteſting
to God, a Penny of this Money ſhould not be beſtowed but upon
this Work, and by their own Committees; and the Commons took
him at his Word, and appointed Treaſurers to receive the Money,
and a Council of War to disburſe the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But the Commons having granted theſe Subſidies, drew up a
Petition againſt the Licence the Popiſh Party had taken during the
Treaty with <hi>Spain.</hi> He was ſo nettled at it, that he called it a
<hi>Stinging One;</hi> and hearing the Commons were entring upon Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
he could not endure it, and upon the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed
the Parliament to the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 1624, and from
thence to the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> leſt the King ſhould hear of another
ſtinging Petition, or a Diſturbance in the <hi>French</hi> Treaty: but at
this Adjournment he told them, at their next Meeting they might
handle Grievances, ſo as they did not hunt after them, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
any but thoſe of Importance; yet I do not find the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ever met again, at leaſt never did any thing: However the
King paſſed a General Pardon, and the Parliament cenſured <hi>Lionel</hi>
Earl of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> Lord Treaſurer, for Corruption in his Office,
50000 <hi>l.</hi> to the King, and to be impriſoned in the Tower during
the King's Pleaſure, which was but three days after the Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Parliament; for upon the firſt of <hi>June</hi> he was ſet

                  <p>Whilſt theſe things were doing in Parliament, the Earl of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol</hi>
was recalled from his Embaſſy; but before his Arrival, the
Duke dealt by all means, that the Earl might be committed to the
Tower before he ſhould be admitted to the King's Preſence: But
fearing the Marquiſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and my Lord Chamberlain, would
oppoſe him herein, the Duke preſſed them that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
in it; vowing (as <hi>Somerſet</hi> did to Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury)</hi> he
intended the Earl no hurt, but only feared, that if he ſhould be
admitted to the King's Preſence, he would croſs and diſturb the
Courſe of Affairs: but neither of theſe Lords would condeſcend
thereunto. This was atteſted by my Lord Chamberlain before the

                  <p>At <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> the Earl heard of the Aſperſions caſt upon him by

him in Parliament: but when he came to <hi>Calais,</hi> tho he ſent over
to have one of the King's Ships allowed him, and for which pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Orders were given; and tho the King <hi>(James)</hi> had Ships
which lay at <hi>Boloign,</hi> which might have every day been with him
in three Hours, and the Wind fair, yet none came, tho the Earl
waited for one eight Days; ſo that he was forced to paſs the Sea
to <hi>Dover</hi> in a Boat and ſix Oars.</p>
                  <p>When the Earl was landed at <hi>Dover,</hi> he was, by a Letter from
my Lord <hi>Conway</hi> (a Creature of the Duke's) commanded in the
King's Name to retire to his Houſe, and not to come to Court, or
the King's Preſence, until he had anſwered to certain Queſtions,
which his Majeſty would appoint ſome of the Council to ask him:
but this was not out of any ill meaning to him, but for fear the
Parliament ſhould fall too violently upon him; and this the Duke
ſaid to ſome of his Friends, was the Reaſon of the Earl's Reſtraint.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Earl humbly petitioned the King he might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to Parliament, and that if he had not ſerved the King ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
in all things, he deſerved no Favour, but to be proceeded
againſt with all Severity; but received Anſwer from the King,
That there ſhould be but few days paſt before he would put an
end to his Affairs: but the Parliament was adjourned before the
few days paſſed, nor did he ever put an end to them. You may
read the further Contrivances againſt him by the Duke, in <hi>Ruſhw.</hi>
from <hi>fol.</hi> 259, to 265.</p>
                  <p>After the Adjournment of the Parliament (or, if you will, the
Diſſolution of it) tho the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> could not obtain Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
into the King's Preſence, yet he obtained Leave to anſwer to
all the Duke had, in his Abſence, charged upon him in Parliament;
and withal wrote to the Duke, that if he, or any Man living, was
able to make Reply, he would ſubmit himſelf to any thing which
ſhould be demanded: which tho the Duke preſumptuouſly ſaid,
<hi>That it is not an Aſſertion to be granted, that the Earl of</hi> Briſtol <hi>by
his Anſwer had ſatisfied the King, the Prince, or himſelf, of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence;</hi>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:60932:73"/>
yet it ſo ſatisfied the King, that when the Duke after
preſſed the King that the Earl might ſubmit, and acknowledg his
Fault, the King anſwered, <hi>I were to be accounted a Tyrant, to engage
an innocent Man to confeſs Faults of which he was not guilty.</hi> Tho the
Earl ſaid he could prove this upon Oath, yet the Duke wrote to
him, that the Concluſion of all that had been treated with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
was, that he (the Earl) ſhould make the Acknowledgment
as was ſet down in that Paper, tho at that time the King ſent him
word, that he would hear him againſt the Duke, as well as he had
heard the Duke concerning him; and ſoon after the King died;
which Promiſe of the King's, the Earl prayed God did the King
no hurt: however, the Earl obtained Leave of the King to come
to <hi>London,</hi> to follow his private Affairs. Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth</hi> therefore
errs a little in point of time, where he ſays, <hi>fol.</hi> 149. the Earl
was committed to the Tower in King <hi>James</hi> his time; for he was
not committed till the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1625. in the firſt Year of
King <hi>Charles,</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Stow</hi>'s Life of King <hi>Charles,

                  <p>We have now done with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match, at leaſt during this
King's Reign; yet the King's Deſires of ſeeing his Son married,
which he ſhall never ſee, were as impatient as thoſe of getting the
<hi>Infanta</hi>'s huge Portion: and to that end, before the Meeting of
the Parliament, and while the Treaty with the <hi>Infanta</hi> was yet
breathing, the King ſent my Lord <hi>Kenſington</hi> (after Earl of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi>
to feel the Pulſe of the <hi>French</hi> Court, how it beat towards
an Alliance between the Prince, and Princeſs <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi>

                  <p>So prodigal was King <hi>James</hi> of his Promiſes, and ſo negligent
in their Performance, whether they were in his power or not.
Now let's ſee what became of this bluſter of Words, and how the
Intereſt of King <hi>James</hi> was common in this very Treaty, with the
<hi>most High, most Excellent, and most Puiſſant Prince,</hi> his <hi>most dear,</hi>
and <hi>most beloved Brother, Couſin and Ally,</hi> Lewis.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lewis,</hi> whilſt King <hi>James</hi> was intent upon his Pleaſures, and
purſuing the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Matches, had taken almoſt all the
In-land Cautionary Towns which the <hi>Reformed</hi> held in <hi>France,</hi> and
about the Beginning of this Treaty, by the Interpoſition of his
Mother, had made Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> prime Miniſter of State, who
ſhall ſerve her as <hi>Buckingham</hi> ſhall ſerve the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
and <hi>Laud</hi> his Patron <hi>Williams,</hi> Lord Keeper; and to <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi>
did <hi>Lewis</hi> commit the Management of this Treaty, another-gueſs
Miniſter of State than <hi>Olivares</hi> was in <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſhall pay
<hi>Buckingham</hi> his own again with Intereſt.</p>

                     <hi>Nani, lib. 5. fol.</hi> 205. obſerves of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> that the King had
no Inclination to him, there being a certain natural ſecret Averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to thoſe, who with an Aſcendant of Wit exceed: Sure it is,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60932:74"/>
the Cardinal poſſeſſed rather the Power of Favour than the Favour
it ſelf; nevertheleſs, he had the <hi>Great Art</hi> how to fix the mutable
and ſuſpicious <hi>Genius</hi> of the King, and the inconſtant Nature of
the People, governing as with a ſupream Dictatorſhip, the one
and the other, even to his Death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richlieu</hi> had his Eyes in all the Corners of the Court of <hi>England,</hi>
and was throughly informed of the King's Fondneſs of this Match,
and of the Inſufficiency of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to encounter him in the
Tranſactions of it; and therefore how ſweetly and deſiredly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Propoſition was embraced in <hi>France,</hi> yet in the Treaty
<hi>Richlieu</hi> ſtood upon his Tip-toes, now that of <hi>Spain</hi> was broke off.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, he would not abate one <hi>Iota</hi> of the Articles
of Religion and Liberty to the Popiſh Recuſants, which was
agreed upon in <hi>Spain;</hi> nay, he raiſed them higher: for it was but
ſit, he ſaid, <hi>His Maſter, who was the eldeſt Son of the Church,
ſhould not abate any thing of what was granted to the Catholick King:</hi>
if there had been nothing elſe, this would have cauſed another
ſtinging Petition from the Commons (as the King called it) if
ever they had met again.</p>
                  <p>And though her Portion was but 800000 Crowns, (not one
tenth of the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s) yet the Conſideration of it muſt be 18000 <hi>l.
per Ann.</hi> Jointure, <hi>(which her Son encreaſed to 40000 l.)</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
the King <hi>(James)</hi> ſhall give her 50000 <hi>l.</hi> in Jewels, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſhe ſhall have the Property, as of thoſe ſhe has already, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of what ſhe ſhall have hereafter: The King alſo <hi>(James)</hi> ſhall
be obliged to maintain her and her Houſe; and in caſe ſhe come
to be a Widow, ſhe ſhall enjoy her Dowry and Jointure, which
ſhall be aſſigned in Lands, Caſtles, and Houſes, whereof one ſhall
be furniſhed and fit for Habitation, and the ſaid Jointure be paid
her whereſoever ſhe ſhall deſire to reſide; ſhe ſhall alſo have the
free Diſpoſal of all the Benefices and Offices belonging to the ſaid
Lands, whereof one to be a Dutchy or County.</p>
                  <p>And in caſe ſhe ſurvive her Husband, her Dowry ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to her entirely, whether ſhe live in <hi>England</hi> or not: and
in caſe ſhe die before her Husband, without Children, the Moie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of her Portion to be returned: yet this Portion muſt one half
be paid the Year after the Contract, the other half the Year after
that.</p>
                  <p>Having taken a view of the Temporal Articles of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
let's ſee what was agreed to in thoſe which referred to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

                              <p>THIS Negotiation was ſo happy, that it cauſed the King to
conſent to all the Articles which were demanded for the
<hi>Catholicks,</hi> and that his Majeſty gave Charge to his Ambaſſadors to
agree to them: they ſigned them with the Cardinal at <hi>Paris</hi> the

                              <p>That <hi>Madame</hi> the King's Siſter ſhould have all ſort of Liberty in

                              <p>THE Inſtructions which were given to Father <hi>de Berule,</hi> were

That the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> having demanded of the King his

his Son; his Majeſty hearken'd the more willingly to this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
in that he eſteem'd it very profitable towards the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as heretofore a <hi>French</hi> Princeſs married into
<hi>England,</hi> had induced them to embrace Chriſtianity: but the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
which he had vowed to the Holy See, and particularly to his
Holineſs, who baptized him in the Name of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VIII
did not permit him to execute the Treaty without having obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Diſpenſations. That this Marriage ought to be look'd upon,
not only for the Benefit of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catholicks, but of all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,</hi>
who would thereby receive great Advantage: That there
was nothing to be hazarded for in <hi>Madame,</hi> ſeeing that ſhe was as
firm in the Faith and in Piety as he could deſire: That ſhe had a
Biſhop and 28 Prieſts to do their Duties: That ſhe had not a
Domeſtick that was not Catholick, and that the King of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
and the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> would oblige themſelves by Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and by Oath, not to ſolicit her directly or indirectly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by themſelves, or by Perſons interpoſed, to change her Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
On the contrary, having nothing to fear for her, he had
great Cauſe to hope, that ſhe being dearly beloved of the King,
who was already well enough diſpoſed to be a Catholick, and of
the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> ſhe might by ſo much the more contribute
to their Converſion, as Women have wonderful Power over their
Husbands, and their Fathers-in-law, when Love hath given them
the Aſcendant over their Spirits: That ſhe was ſo zealous in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
that there was no doubt but ſhe would employ in this pious
Deſign, all that depended upon her Induſtry; and that if God
ſhould not bleſs Intentions in the Perſon of King <hi>James,</hi> and of
the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> it was apparent that their Children would be
the Reſtorers of the Faith which their Anceſtors had deſtroyed,
ſeeing ſhe would have the Charge to educate them in the Belief
and in the Exerciſes of the Catholick Religion till the Age of 13
Years; and that theſe firſt Seeds of Piety being laid in their Souls,
cultivated with Care at the time when they ſhould be more ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
of Inſtructions, would infallibly produce ſtable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
Fruits, that is to ſay, a Faith ſo firm, that it may not be
ſhaken by Hereſy in a riper Age. That after all, the Catholicks
of <hi>England</hi> would receive no ſmall Profit at preſent, ſince the King
of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> would both oblige
themſelves upon their Faith, and by Writing, no more to enquire
after them, nor puniſh them when they ſhould be diſcovered; to
enlarge all thoſe that had been impriſoned, and to make them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of Money and of other Goods that had been taken from
them ſince the laſt Edict, if they were yet in being; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to treat them with more Favour than they could have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from the Alliance with <hi>Spain.</hi> And further, He had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to let the Pope underſtand, that to render more Reſpect to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60932:75"/>
the Church, it had been agreed that <hi>Madame</hi> ſhould be affianced
and married according to the Catholick Form, and agreeable to
that which was followed at the Marriage which <hi>Charles</hi> IX. made of
Madam <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>France</hi> with the late King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. then King
of <hi>Navarre.</hi> All theſe things ſpoke themſelves, and appeared ſo
viſibly, that they would admit of no doubt; ſo this Father that
wanted neither Spirit nor Fire, repreſented them dexterouſly to

of the Match between his Son and the Infanta of <hi>Spain</hi> were not for
the Benefit of the Eſtabliſhed Religion at home, and of the Reformed

God ſhall ſurely judg him, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> he never thought nor meant, nor
never in Words expreſſed any thing that ſavoured of it?</p>
                  <p>Do not Religion, Truth, and Juſtice ſupport the Thrones of
Princes? and Hypocriſy, Falſhood, and Injuſtice undermine and
overthrow them? What future Happineſs then could either the

both, ſo diametrically contrary to the Laws and Conſtitutions of
this Nation, wherein the Majeſty of the King, as well as the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Nation, is founded? and to govern by theſe, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
this Treaty, will be impoſſible. What Peace could the
Prince find at home, even in his Bed, when an imperious <hi>French</hi>
Wife ſhall be ever inſtigating him to break his Coronation-Oath,
to truckle to that impoſed upon him by her Brother of <hi>France?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Pills, how bitter ſoever, muſt be ſwallowed by the King,
rather than his Son ſhall be baulk'd a ſecond time; nay, it ſeems
they were very ſweet to him: For Mr. <hi>Howel,</hi> in the Life of
<hi>Lewis</hi> III. ſays, <hi>fol.</hi> 66. that King <hi>James</hi> ſaid paſſionately to the

                  </p>
                  <p>My Lords, the King of <hi>France</hi> has wrote unto me, That he is
ſo far my Friend, that if ever I have need of him, he will render
me Offices in Perſon, whenſoever I ſhall deſire him: <hi>(the Truth
of this you will ſee by and by.)</hi> Truly he hath gained upon me
more than any of his Predeceſſors; and he may believe me, that
in any thing that ſhall concern him, I will employ not only my
Peoples Lives, but my own; <hi>(Bravely ſpoken, and like K.</hi> James)
and whoſoever of his Subjects <hi>(Lewis</hi>'s) ſhall riſe againſt him,

                  <p>But <hi>Venus</hi> muſt not have the only Aſcendant in this Treaty; for
the Cardinal will have <hi>Mars</hi> to be in Conjunction with her: and
'twas high time; for at this time Monſieur <hi>Sobiez</hi> had provided a
great Fleet of Men of War (as Times went then with the <hi>French)</hi>
and had entered and ſurpriſed the Fort of <hi>Blavet</hi> in <hi>Bretaign,</hi> and
took and carried away ſix of the <hi>French</hi> great Men of War out of
it, and alſo taken the Iſles of <hi>Rhe</hi> and <hi>Oleron,</hi> which he began to
fortify; and being abſolute Maſter of the Sea, triumphantly, with
a Fleet of 75 Men of War of all ſorts, landed a conſiderable Force
at <hi>Medoc</hi> near <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Court of <hi>France</hi> was never ſo alarmed as at this, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all the King's Victories over the <hi>Reformed</hi> by Land; and
therefore the Cardinal threw another Article into the Treaty, That
King <hi>James</hi> ſhould lend the <hi>French</hi> a Fleet of Ships to repreſs <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biez;</hi>
and in lieu thereof, the <hi>French</hi> ſhould permit <hi>Mansfield,</hi> who
had raiſed an Army of 10000 Foot and 2000 Horſe in <hi>England,</hi>
to land at <hi>Calais;</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> ſhould join him with another
Body of Horſe and Foot, for the Recovery of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſee the <hi>French</hi> Faith, and how well <hi>Lewis</hi> made good his
Promiſe to King <hi>James,</hi> to render him all Offices in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
whenſoever King <hi>James</hi> ſhould deſire him: for at this time
the Army being ſhipt at <hi>Dover,</hi> and put over to <hi>Calais,</hi> where
being denied Entrance, and having no other Inſtructions, and
wanting Proviſions, they lay neglected at Sea; and in this Diſtreſs
a Peſtilence raged among them, ſo that they were forced to ſail to
<hi>Zealand,</hi> where having no Orders, they were denied Landing there:
and this being the moſt terrible Seaſon of the Year, in <hi>December,</hi>
what by Hunger, Cold, and Peſtilence, above two thirds of them
periſhed, before Leave could be obtained to land them in <hi>Holland;</hi>
ſo that they never did the King of <hi>Spain</hi> near ſo much Hurt, as
they had done in <hi>England</hi> before they were ſhipt, living upon
Plunder and Free-Quarter.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were ſad Preſages of future Happineſs from the deſigned
Marriage, yet theſe things no ways diſcompoſed the quiet Repoſe
of our pacifick King: ſo as he might ſee his only Son married to
a Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> was all his Buſineſs; no matter how. The
Thirſt (which God was his Judg, and as he was a Chriſtian
King, he had contracted, equal to that of the wayfaring Man in
the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and in danger of Death for want of Water)
for the good Succeſs of the Parliament, is now aſſwaged by the
granting of three Subſidies and three Fifteenths: Here's no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of marrying his only Son with the Tears of his only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and he is ſtill ready, with the Lives of his Subjects, and his
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60932:76"/>
own, to aſſiſt the moſt High, moſt Excellent, and moſt Puiſſant
Prince, his moſt dear, and moſt beloved Brother, Couſin, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Ally, <hi>Lewis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Managers of this Treaty were, <hi>Hay</hi> a <hi>Scots</hi>-man, created
Earl of <hi>Carliſle;</hi> and the Lord <hi>Kenſington,</hi> for the more Honour of
it, created Earl of <hi>Holland;</hi> two of the King's Favourites of the
ſecond Rate, but who bare no proportion to the Sagacity, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Integrity of the Earl of <hi>Briſtol. Briſtol</hi> was all Heare
of Oak, and would not bend to <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Pride and Ambition;
but they were Willows, that were liable to every Nod and Wind
of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Breath.</p>
                  <p>But how comes <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who muſt have an Oar in every
Boat, to be abſent from this Treaty? The Reaſon was, tho he
were not wiſe, yet he was jealous, leſt King <hi>James,</hi> in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
ſhould hear <hi>Briſtol</hi> againſt him, as the King had promiſed,
as well as he had heard <hi>Buckingham</hi> againſt him; which was ſo
dangerous a Rock, as our Land-Admiral would not venture to run
againſt.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all this Haſte for conſummating this deſired
Marriage, the Thread of the King's Life was ſpun out before;
for upon the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>March, Ann.</hi> 1625. he died at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> in
the <hi>58th</hi> Year of his Age, having reigned twenty two Years com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.
Having had an Ague, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> did upon
<hi>Monday</hi> the <hi>21st</hi> before, when in the Judgment of the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
the Ague was in its Declination, apply Plaiſters to the Wriſts
and Belly of the King, and alſo did deliver ſeveral quantities of
Drink to the King, tho ſome of the King's Phyſicians did diſallow
thereof, and refuſed to meddle further with the King, until the
ſaid Plaiſters were removed; and that the King found himſelf

it was next to poſitive Proof; for King <hi>Charles,</hi> rather than this
Charge ſhould come to an Iſſue, diſſolved the Parliament, which
was a Failure of Juſtice, tho the Commons had voted him four
Subſidies, and four Fifteenths, before it was paſſed into an Act.</p>

                     <p>It's true, I do not find the Marriage of a Man's Siſter's Daughter

it is by inference forbidden, and is abhorrent to Nature: So that

It were endleſs to enumerate the Doctrines of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> how diſhonourable they are to God, and his ſacred Laws. I'll
give Inſtances only in two: 1. Their <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> after
Death, many of which are of their own making, thereby attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
to them a concurring Power with God, in his Omniſcience,
which is a robbing God of his Honour; and if Saints after Death
be not Omniſcient, it were in vain to pray to them.</p>
                     <p>The other is diſpenſing with Mens Promiſes and their own,
tho they have bound themſelves to the Performance of them by
an Oath; whereby the Popes render themſelves Enemies of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and Humane Society: for theſe are founded in Truth, and
Mens mutual Performance of their Promiſes. That this for ſeveral
hundreds of Years hath been practiſed by the Popes upon thoſe
Princes and Subjects, whom they pleaſe to call <hi>Hereticks,</hi> (when
the Popes are greater) is well known to thoſe converſant in their
Hiſtories: I'll give but one Inſtance of the Liberty the Popes
take to themſelves herein.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Death of Pope <hi>Marcellus 2d, Ann.</hi> 1555. the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals

Pope, mutually ſwore, That whoſoever ſhould be choſen,
ſhould call a Synod in ſix Years, and not make more than 4 Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
in two Years after the Election, and <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> was choſed.
See <hi>the Council of Trent,</hi> Anno 1555.</p>
                     <p>Some ſmall time after this Election, <hi>Paul</hi> entred the <hi>Conclave,</hi>
to declare his Intentions of a Promotion of Cardinals; and the
Cardinal of St. <hi>James</hi>'s preſſed to him, and put him in mind of
his Oath before his Election: but the Pope thruſt the Cardinal
back, and told him, <hi>This was to bind the Pope's Authority; that it is
an Article of Faith, that the Pope cannot be bound, much leſs bind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
that to ſay otherwiſe was manifeſt Hereſy, from which he did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve

was <hi>in Cathedra,</hi> and infallible, and never ſince retracted by him,

for which Men muſt be ſlaughtered and burnt, and for not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them againſt the Evidence of a Man's Senſes to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

Wine in the Sacrament after Conſecration, is Chriſt's organical
Body and Blood: This is that true and Mother-Church which the
King would meet mid-way, if it would let him and his <hi>Inherent

                     <p>This is that Prince who to proſecute theſe Brawls, and to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

the Treaty with the <hi>Dutch</hi> for Licence to fiſh upon the

A Prince fearful of all his Enemies abroad, while he was
only great by exerciſing a Tyrannical Arbitrary Power over his

                  <p>'TWAS a ſtrange Reign this: As this King's Father's Reign
was introduced with a horrible Plague, ſo was this
King's with a greater, and ſuch as no Records of any
Times before mention the like: The firſt 15 Years of
his Reign were perfectly <hi>French,</hi> and ſuch as never before were ſeen,
or heard of in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation: this brought on a miſerable
War in all the three Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and Deſtruction upon the King, whenas it was not in the Power of
thoſe which firſt raiſed the War againſt him to ſave his Life, which
they would have done. <hi>Baptiſta Nani,</hi> in the ſixth Book of the
Hiſtory of <hi>Venice,</hi> An. 1625, <hi>f.</hi> 221, obſerves, That after the
Marriage of King <hi>Charles</hi> with the Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of State, or rather the Paſſion of Favourites, converted the
Bonds of Affection into Cauſes of Hatred: <hi>Europe</hi> in thoſe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60932:80"/>
times reckoned it amidſt its unhappy Deſtiny, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it fell upon three young Kings, yet in the Flower of their
Age, Princes of great Power, deſirous of Glory, and in Intereſt
contrary; but in this alone by <hi>Genius</hi> agreeing, that they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Burden of Affairs to the Will of their Miniſters: for with
equal Independency, <hi>France</hi> was governed by <hi>Richlieu, Spain</hi> by
<hi>Olivares,</hi> and <hi>Great-Britain</hi> by <hi>Buckingham,</hi> confounding Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with Intereſt, as well publick as private. Betwixt the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and <hi>Buckingham</hi> open Animoſities diſcovered themſelves, for
Cauſes ſo much more unadviſed, as they were more hard to be
known.</p>
                  <p>When King <hi>James</hi> died, the Nation was rent into four Parties,
<hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Prerogative,</hi> which exalted the King's divided Will from
the Laws and Conſtitutions, above his <hi>Royal</hi> and <hi>Legal</hi> Will: The
<hi>Country, or Legal Party,</hi> which ſtood for the Legal Eſtabliſhment
of Church and State; and the <hi>Puritan,</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Parties.</hi> After
the Treaties of Marriage between the Prince and the Daughters of
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Prerogative Parties</hi> joined for
carrying on the Court-Deſigns; and were oppoſed by the <hi>Country</hi>
and <hi>Puritan Parties:</hi> and as the Prerogative and Popiſh Factions
grew more inſolent, ſo the Puritan Party gathered Strength and
Reputation among the Vulgar or ordinary People, inſomuch that in
Number they became more than all the other three. We ſhall
take a better View of this Reign, if we look a little back into the
former.</p>
                  <p>After the Treaty of the Match with <hi>Spain</hi> was broken off, King
<hi>James</hi> was perplext what to do, he had neither Money nor Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to make War for the Recovery of the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> and the
Wounds which he had given the laſt Parliament, by Impriſoning
their Members for adviſing him to make War for the Recovery
of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> were yet freſh and bleeding; and yet <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
whom he durſt not offend, not content to ſatisfy his Spite
againſt <hi>Olivares,</hi> by breaking off the Match, was, notwithſtanding
all Difficulties, nay Impoſſibility of Succeſs, ſtill puſhing on the
King to declare War againſt the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King thereupon referred this Buſineſs to my Lord Keeper

had acted the Part of an Enemy declaredly, as the Duke objected:
and indeed my Lord Keeper's Reaſons againſt the War governed
all the reſt, that ſaw no Expediency for War upon the Grounds
communicated by <hi>Buckingham.</hi> And 'twas more obſervable, that

Buſineſs of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> was never mentioned; and now he is

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whom ſhall we fall? Either
upon the Emperor, or King of <hi>Spain:</hi> the Emperor had in a ſort offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the King his Son-in-law's Country again for Payment of a great
Sum of Money, in recompence of Disburſments: but where was the
Money to be had? yet it might be cheaper bought than conquered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a War was ended. For the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he ſaw no Cauſe to
aſſault him with Arms: He had held us indeed in a long Treaty to
our Loſs, but he held nothing from us; and was more likely to continue
the State of things in a State of Poſſibility of Accommodation, becauſe
he diſliked the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Ambition, and had rather ſtop the
Enlargement of his Territories.</p>
                  <p>The King embraced this Advice; nor did he ſtay here (yet
did not ſtay long) but ſpake hardly of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who would
have put him upon making War upon the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and the
King's Cenſure upon him was ſo bitter, <hi>(Cabal,</hi> Page 92.) that it
was fit to be caſt over-board in Silence, ſays the Biſhop of <hi>Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,
f. 169, 170. tit.</hi> 175.</p>
                  <p>This Reſolution of the Council was ſo little to the Duke's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
that the Biſhop ſays in the ſame <hi>Tit.</hi> that it made the
Duke riſe up, and chafe againſt them from Room to Room, as a
Hen that had loſt her Brood, and clucks up and down when ſhe
has none to follow her: Nor did the Duke ſtop here, but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the fierce Anger of the King, and his not anſwering one
of the Keeper's Reaſons, he appealed from the Judgment of the
Council to the Parliament: Sure he durſt not have done this, if he
had not been ſure of the Prince to ſecond him againſt the Opinion
and Anger of his Father.</p>
                  <p>This was the third inexpiable Crime the Keeper had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againſt the Duke: the firſt was his Advice to the Duke,
when he was in <hi>Spain,</hi> to hold a good Correſpondence with the
Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and <hi>Olivares;</hi> but finding the contrary, by a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Duke of the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> which you may read in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Litchfield</hi>'s Life of Biſhop <hi>Williams, fol. 136. tit.</hi> 146. and
another of the <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>July, tit. 155. fol.</hi> 147. where he in gentle
manner informed the Duke, as from the King himſelf, how zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
the King was, not only of fair Terms between the Duke and
Earl, but of a nearer Alliance. This was ſuch a piece of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the Keeper, that the Biſhop ſays in the next <hi>tit.</hi> that
it removed the Duke's Affections from the Keeper for ever;
nor could this State-Miniſter contain his Diſpleaſure, but wrote
to my Lord <hi>Mandevile,</hi> that the firſt Action he would imbarque
himſelf in, when he came home, ſhould be to remove the
Keeper out of his Place. And the next Crime of the Keeper, was,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60932:81"/>
The Duke was afraid of his Wit. See the Biſhop, <hi>tit.</hi> 156.</p>
                  <p>However, this Counſel took ſuch Effect with King <hi>James,</hi> and
he was ſo ſatisfied that he had no Colour of Title to make
War againſt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that when the Parliament after
gave him three Subſidies, and three Fifteens, for the Recovery of
the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> and when he had raiſed an Army of 10000 Foot
and 2000 Horſe to be commanded by Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> the King
not only made it a Condition, that <hi>Mansfield,</hi> with the Army,
ſhould not commit any Hoſtility againſt any of the <hi>Dominions,</hi>
which by Right appertained to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or the <hi>Infanta
Iſabella,</hi> Princeſs of the <hi>Low Countries</hi> (or the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands)</hi>
and in caſe he did ſo, from that time the King was not longer to
continue Payment of the Army, but alſo took an Oath of <hi>Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>
to obſerve the Conditions.</p>
                  <p>So that how powerful ſoever the Duke was over King <hi>James,</hi>
yet in none of theſe Particulars could he obtain his End; <hi>viz.</hi> in
not prevailing upon the King to make War upon the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> nor in removing the Lord Keeper, nor in having the Earl
of <hi>Briſtol</hi> committed to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the breaking of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match, it was obſerved that
King <hi>James</hi>'s Temper was quite ſo altered, that he forgot his Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
of Hunting and Hawking at <hi>New-Market,</hi> but whilſt he was
there, he remained as in an Infirmary; and in a Fit of Melancholy,
told the Earl of <hi>Carliſle</hi> that if he had ſent <hi>Williams</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi>
with his Son, he had kept Hearts-eaſe and Honour, both which
he wanted. See the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield, lib. 1. tit.</hi> 174.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>James</hi> then began to look back upon his former Actions,
in having loſt the Affections of his Subjects; and now intangled in
the Difficulties which he ſaw inevitably coming upon him, charged
the Prince often, in the hearing of the Lord Keeper <hi>Williams,</hi> to
call Parliaments often, and to continue them, tho their Raſhneſs
ſometimes did offend him: That in his own Experience he never
got any Good by falling out with them. See the Biſhop of <hi>Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,
lib. 2. f. 16. tit.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>How well King <hi>Charles</hi> obſerved his Father's Advice in any of
theſe; nay, how diametrically he went contrary, and contrary to
all good Advice given him in the very firſt Year of his Reign, will
ſoon appear, and the miſerable Effects which followed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have heard my Father (tho not a Courtier, yet acquainted
with many Courtiers) ſay,</hi> that they would oft pray to God that
the Prince might be in the right Way where he ſet, for if he were in
the wrong, he would prove the moſt wilful of any King that ever reigned.</p>
                  <p>Tho all muſt ſtoop to mighty <hi>Buckingham,</hi> yet that he might
ſtand ſurer, who muſt be his only Support but <hi>Laud,</hi> Biſhop of
Saint <hi>Davids;</hi> who from picking Quarrels in Lectures at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
and being an Informer before, now is become Vice-gerent to <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham?</hi>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:60932:81"/>
A Liſt of all the eminent Men for Promotion in the
Church is given in; thoſe whom <hi>Laud</hi> would have promoted
were noted (O) for <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and whom he liked not were marked
(P) for <hi>Puritans:</hi> theſe two ſtopt up both the King's Ears from
any other Doctrines in Church or State, but what was infuſed by
them; ſo early did King <hi>James</hi>'s Prophecy to my Lord Keeper
<hi>Williams,</hi> when he was ſo importunate to have <hi>Laud</hi> preferred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to be fulfilled. Before a Year goes about, you ſhall ſee <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>
ſet the King at odds with the Parliament, and yet engage
him in a War againſt <hi>Spain;</hi> and before another goes about, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
the King in another againſt <hi>France,</hi> to ſatiate his Spight and
Revenge againſt <hi>Richlieu,</hi> for croſſing him in his Luſt; and after
13 Years, <hi>Laud</hi> ſhall be the Fire-brand to ſet all the three Nations
in the Flame of a <hi>Civil War,</hi> as King <hi>James</hi> had foretold. But
it's time to come to Particulars.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Enterpriſe which the Duke engaged the King in, was
not for the Recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> as he pretended when he
would have engaged King <hi>James</hi> in a War againſt the King of
<hi>Spain;</hi> but to expreſs his Hatred againſt <hi>Olivares:</hi> and therefore
a Fleet muſt be rigged up, to make War in <hi>Spain,</hi> even when King
<hi>James</hi>'s Corps lay unburied, and at ſo unſeaſonable a time, when
the Charges of King <hi>James</hi>'s Funeral were ſo faſt approaching, and
when the Charges of the King's Ambaſſadors, the Earls of <hi>Carliſle</hi>
and <hi>Holland,</hi> ran ſo high at <hi>Paris,</hi> to outvy the <hi>French</hi> Splendor,
for ſolemnizing the Marriage between the King and the Queen;
and theſe ſo much more augmented, by the Duke's Preparations
to fetch the Queen over, which, when the Duke ſhall come to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
muſt outſhine not only the Bravery of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
but all that Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> could do.</p>
                  <p>From the Unſeaſonableneſs of this Expedition, let's ſee by what
Counſels <hi>Buckingham</hi> managed this deſigned Expedition; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
take Light from a Letter which my Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> wrote to the
Duke, and which you may read in <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>'s Collections, <hi>fol.
199.</hi> after the Fleet had lain ſo long, that the Seaſon of the Year
was paſt, and moſt dangerous for Ships to put to Sea. The Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is <hi>Verbatim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THey offer to lay Wagers the Fleet goes not this Year, and that of
neceſſity ſhortly a Parliament muſt be; which, when it comes,
ſure it will much diſcontent you. It's wonder'd at, that ſince the King
did give ſuch great Gifts to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chevereux,</hi> and thoſe that
went, how now a ſmall Sum in the Parliament ſhould be called for at
ſuch a time: and let the Parliament ſit when it will, begin they will
where they ended. They ſay, the Lords of the Council knew nothing of
<hi>Mansfield</hi>'s Journey, or this Fleet, which diſcontents even the beſt ſort,
if not all. They ſay, it is a very great Burden your Grace takes upon
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60932:82"/>
you, ſince none know any thing but you. It's conceived, that not let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
others bear part of the Burden you now bear, it may ruin you,
(which Heavens forbid). Much Diſcourſe there is of your Lordſhip,
here and there, as I paſſed home and back; and nothing is more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
at, than that one grave Man is not known to have your ear, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
my Good and Noble Lord <hi>Conway.</hi> All Men ſay, if you go not
with the Fleet, you will ſuffer in it; becauſe if it proſper, it will be
thought no Act of yours; and if it ſucceed ill, it might have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
if you had not guided the King. They ſay, your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakings in
this Kingdom will much prejudice your Grace: and if God bleſs you not
with Goodneſs, to accept kindly what in Duty and Love I offer, queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs
my Freedom of letting you know the Diſcourſe of the World, may
prejudice me. But if I must loſe your Favour, I had rather loſe it for
ſtriving to do you good, in letting you know the Talk of the wicked
World, than for any thing elſe; ſo much I heartily deſire your Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and to ſee you trample the ignorant Multitude under foot. All I
have ſaid is the Diſcourſe of this World; and when I am able to judg
of Actions, I will freely tell your Lordſhip my Mind, which when it
ſhall not always incline to ſerve you, may all my noble Thoughts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
me. <hi>The Succeſs of this Expedition you will hear ſoon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus was the King of <hi>Spain</hi> required for all the noble Favours
he had ſhewn the King when he was in <hi>Spain.</hi> This was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Proteſtation to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> when they
parted at the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> [That he would be an everlaſting Servant
to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Queen, and the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and would do
the beſt Offices he could for concluding the Buſineſs (the Match
between the Prince and <hi>Infanta)</hi> and ſtrengthen the Amity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Kingdoms] to have War made upon him, without
any Declaration of it by King <hi>Charles,</hi> ſo ſoon as it came in his
Power to do it.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Buckingham</hi> became Lord Admiral, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navy lay
at Road unarmed, and fit for Ruin, as you may ſee in <hi>Ruſhworth,
fol.</hi> 3. This was before the Treaty of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match; and after
the breaking of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match, the Duke not only neglected
the guarding of the Seas, whereby the Trade of the Nation not
only decayed, but the Seas became ignominiouſly infeſted by Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
and Enemies, to the Loſs of very many of the Merchants and
Subjects of <hi>England;</hi> as you may read in the Fourth Article of the
Charge of the Commons againſt him, in <hi>Ruſhworth, fol.</hi> 312.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection.</hi> But this was but an Accuſation, and therefore it does
not amount to a Proof.</p>
                  <p>It ought not to be preſumed, the Commons would have char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
this upon him without Proof; and I ſay it is ſtrong Proof up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Duke, ſince the King diſſolved the Parliament rather than
the Duke ſhould come to a Trial upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:60932:82"/>
However, the Navy lay thus neglected, and Seas unguarded;
and tho the <hi>French</hi> had broken the Treaty of Marriage with <hi>France,</hi>
by not ſuffering <hi>Mansfield</hi> to land his Army at <hi>Calais,</hi> yet the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
the <hi>French</hi> with a Fleet to ſubdue the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> muſt be
performed: And to this end, even whilſt King <hi>James</hi> lay unbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
great Conſultation between the Duke and the Marquiſs of
<hi>Efſiat</hi> was had how this might be done. The King had no Men
of War ready, but the <hi>Vaunt-Guard;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Neceſſities
were urgent, for all this while <hi>Sobiez</hi> rode triumphant at Sea, the
<hi>French</hi> not being able to encounter him; and thereby <hi>Rochel</hi> upon
all Occaſions was relieved by Sea.</p>
                  <p>However, the <hi>French</hi> muſt be gratified, or this hopeful Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
with <hi>France</hi> might be diſturbed: The Duke therefore, by his
Power of Lord Admiral, beſides the <hi>Vaunt-Guard,</hi> preſſed 7 Ships,
of the Merchants of <hi>England,</hi> into the King's Service; <hi>viz.</hi> The
Great <hi>Neptune,</hi> whereof Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorge</hi> was Captain; the
<hi>Induſtry,</hi> of 450 Tuns, whereof <hi>James Moyer</hi> was Captain; the
<hi>Pearl,</hi> of 540 Tuns, whereof <hi>Anthony Tench</hi> was Captain; the
<hi>Marigold,</hi> of 300 Tuns, whereof <hi>Thomas Davis</hi> was Captain; the
<hi>Loyalty,</hi> of 300 Tuns, <hi>Jaſper Dare</hi> Captain; the <hi>Peter and John,</hi>
of 300 Tuns, <hi>John Davis</hi> Captain; and <hi>7thly,</hi> the <hi>Gift of God,
Henry Lewen</hi> Captain.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, tho the Navy were unprovided with Stores and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
could find Stores and Ammunition ſufficient for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
this Fleet; and upon the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> cauſed a Warrant
under the Great Seal to be iſſued, to call the Companies aboard
which had been raiſed for the <hi>French</hi> Service, with the firſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to go to ſuch a Port as the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
and there to expect Directions.</p>
                  <p>But ſee the Diſſimulation and Hypocriſy of the Duke and <hi>French</hi>
Ambaſſador <hi>d'Efſiat;</hi> for all this while they gave out, that this
Fleet ſhould not be employed againſt the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> but againſt
<hi>Genoua,</hi> which it ſeems took part with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> againſt
the <hi>French</hi> King's Allies in <hi>Italy;</hi> and that Vice-Admiral <hi>Penning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
ſhould not take in any more <hi>French</hi> into any of the Ships of
this Fleet, than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could maſter. Theſe were the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
which the Duke communicated to the Council; and with
theſe <hi>Pennington</hi> ſailed to <hi>Diep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when the Fleet arrived at <hi>Diep,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Momerancy,</hi>
Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> would have put 200 Men into the <hi>Induſtry,</hi> and
offered the like to every one of the other Ships in the Fleet, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them, they were to fight againſt the City and Inhabitants of
<hi>Rochel;</hi> with a Proffer of Chains of Gold, and other Rewards, to
all thoſe Captains, Maſters, and Owners, which ſhould go in this
Service: which they all, with one Conſent, rejected, and ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
their Names to a Petition to <hi>Pennington</hi> againſt it; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60932:83"/>
on <hi>Pennington,</hi> with the whole Fleet, returned into the <hi>Downs,</hi>
and from the <hi>Downs Pennington</hi> wrote a Letter to the Duke, by one
<hi>Ingram,</hi> who ſaw the Duke read it, together with the laſt Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and by <hi>Ingram, Pennington</hi> became a Suitor to the Duke to be
diſcharged of this Employment.</p>
                  <p>This put the Duke and <hi>French</hi> Agents to their Trumps, how to
retrieve their Game; and tho all theſe Tranſactions were conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the King and Council, yet the Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> had
got Knowledg of this Deſign, and the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
of <hi>France,</hi> by <hi>Monſieur de la Touche,</hi> ſolicited the King and
Council againſt this Deſign, and had good Words and Hopes from
both: But <hi>Buckingham</hi> told <hi>de la Touche,</hi> the King his Maſter was
obliged, and ſo the Ships muſt and ſhould go.</p>
                  <p>But there was another Obſtacle to be removed, or this worthy
Deſign was at a full Stop. The Duke had impreſt and hired the
ſeven Merchants Ships upon the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Account, and
for his Service, and ſo they could not be paſſed into the <hi>French</hi>
Hands, without a new Agreement with the Owners: Hereupon
his Grace was pleaſed to take a Journey to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> to ſettle the
Agreement, which muſt be as the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors would, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Owners of the Ships would or not. I will be particular
herein, not only to ſhew what a Miniſter of State <hi>Buckingham</hi> was,
or what Reliance there was upon his Word or Honour, but more
eſpecially, for that the Ruin not only of the whole Intereſt of the
Reformed of <hi>France</hi> was a Conſequence of this Action, wherein
the Mercenary <hi>Dutch</hi> State conſpired alſo with the Duke; but it
was the Foundation upon which the <hi>French</hi> Naval Grandeur was
built, as well to the Terror of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> as of <hi>England</hi> at this
very Day.</p>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>Conway</hi> was the Duke's <hi>Nanny,</hi> and tho principal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of State by the Duke's Promotion, yet made the Office to bend
which way ſoever the Duke nodded: This Lord <hi>Conway</hi> directed
a Letter upon the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1625. as from the King, to Vice-Admiral
<hi>Pennington,</hi> whereby he took upon him to expreſs and
ſignify to him, that his Maſter had left the Command of the Ships
to the <hi>French</hi> King, and that <hi>Pennington</hi> ſhould receive into them
ſo many Men as the <hi>French</hi> King pleaſed, for the time contracted
for <hi>(viz.</hi> ſix Months, but not to exceed eighteen) and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
his Letter ſhould be his ſufficient Warrant. This Letter
was delivered by one <hi>Parker</hi> to <hi>Pennington</hi> in the <hi>Downs;</hi> and the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants had conſtituted one <hi>James Moyer</hi> and <hi>Anthony
Touchin</hi> to treat with the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors (which were the
Duke of <hi>Chevereux,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Vollocleer,</hi> and the Marquiſs of <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiat);</hi>
and at <hi>Rocheſter</hi> the Duke ſent back a Letter to <hi>Moyer</hi> and
<hi>Touchin,</hi> to come and treat with the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, to ſettle
Buſineſs about the Delivery up of their Ships and Fraights, into
the Power of the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:60932:83"/>
The Propoſitions which the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors made to <hi>Moyer</hi>
and <hi>Touchin,</hi> were,</p>
                  <p>1. That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captains, and their Companies, ſhould
conſent and promiſe to ſerve the <hi>French</hi> King againſt all, none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
but the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> in Conformity to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
formerly paſſed between <hi>D'Efſiat</hi> and them.</p>
                  <p>2. That they ſhould conſent and agree, in conſideration of the
Aſſurance given them by the Ambaſſadors, to the Articles of the
<hi>25th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> before, (which you may read in <hi>Ruſhworth, fol.
328.)</hi> whereby the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould be Maſter of the ſaid Ships
by indifferent Inventory, and that they, by him, ſhould be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
againſt all Hazards and Sea-fights; and if they miſcarried,
then the Value of them to be paid by the <hi>French</hi> King, who would
alſo confirm this new Propoſition within 15 Days after the Ships
ſhould be delivered to his Uſe, by good Caution in <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. That if the <hi>French</hi> King would take any Men out of the
Ships, he might; but without any Diminution to the Fraight,
for or in reſpect thereof.</p>
                  <p>To theſe, <hi>Moyer,</hi> in the behalf of the Merchants, anſwered,
1. That their Ships ſhould not go to ſerve againſt <hi>Rochel.</hi> 2. That
they would not ſend their Ships without good Warrants. 3. Nor
without ſufficient Security, to their liking, for the Payment of
their Fraight, and Rendition of their Ships, or the Value thereof:
for the Ambaſſadors Security was by them taken not to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
and they proteſted againſt it, and utterly refuſed the
<hi>peraffetted Inſtrument.</hi> Hereupon Sir <hi>John Epſtey</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho. Dove</hi>
diſſwaded the Duke from this Enterprize, telling him, he could
not juſtify nor anſwer the Delivery of the Ships.</p>
                  <p>However, <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Dictatorſhip would not admit of Juſtice
or Reaſon, but he commanded <hi>Moyer,</hi> and the reſt, that they
ſhould obey the Lord <hi>Conway</hi>'s Letter, and return to <hi>Diep,</hi> to ſerve
the <hi>French,</hi> and that ſo was the King's Pleaſure, (tho the King
told the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s Agent, <hi>de la Touche,</hi> otherwiſe); yet
privately, at the ſame time, the Duke told them, that the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
offered by the Ambaſſadors was ſufficient, and that tho they
went to <hi>Diep,</hi> they might, and then ſhould keep their Ships in
their own Power till they had made their own Conditions.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, the Duke of <hi>Chevereux</hi> and <hi>Vollocleer</hi> conſtituted
<hi>D'Efſiat</hi> their Deputy, to treat with the Merchants at <hi>Diep</hi> for the
Delivery of their Ships into the <hi>French</hi> Power; but with him the
Duke ſent Mr. <hi>Edward Nicholas,</hi> his Secretary, with Inſtructions,
by word of Mouth, to execute the King's Pleaſure by my Lord
<hi>Conway</hi>'s Letter, for putting the Merchants Ships into the <hi>French</hi>
Power, upon the Conditions peraffetted at <hi>Rocheſter</hi> by the three
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60932:84"/>
                     <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors. But the Captains of the Ships refuſed to
ſubmit to the Conditions, tho Mr. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> in the King's Name,
from Day to Day threatned them, and vehemently preſſed them
to deliver up their Ships upon the former Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon <hi>D'Efſiat</hi> (to have further Inſtructions from the Duke)
entred into a new Treaty with the Merchants, and like a <hi>French</hi>
Merchant, got Letters to be ſent into <hi>England,</hi> that the Peace was
concluded with thoſe of the Religion in <hi>France,</hi> and that within
14 Days the War ſhould break out in <hi>Italy,</hi> with a Deſign upon
<hi>Genoua,</hi> a matter of great Importance againſt the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Duke procured the King to write a Letter to <hi>Pennington,</hi>
dated <hi>July</hi> 28. to this effect.</p>
                  <p>HIS Majeſty did thereby charge and command Captain <hi>Penning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
without delay, to put his Highneſs's former Command in
Execution, for conſigning the <hi>Vaunt-Guard</hi> into the hands of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs
<hi>D'Efſiat</hi> for the <hi>French,</hi> with all her Furniture, aſſuring her Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
his Majeſty would provide for their Indemnity: And to require
the other ſeven Ships, in his Majeſty's Name, to put themſelves into
the Service of the <hi>French</hi> King, according to the Promiſe his Majeſty
had made to him: And in caſe of Backwardneſs or Refuſal, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to uſe all forcible means to compel them, even to ſinking;
with a Charge not to fail; and this Letter to be his Warrant.</p>
                  <p>This Letter was deliver'd to <hi>Pennington</hi> in the Beginning of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi>
by Captain <hi>Wilbraham:</hi> Hereupon <hi>Pennington</hi> went back out
of the <hi>Downs,</hi> carrying with him the ſaid Letters, and certain
Inſtructions in Writing from the Duke to his Secretary <hi>Nicholas:</hi>
And about the time <hi>Pennington</hi> returned to <hi>Diep, Nicholas</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Captains of the Ships, and told them, it was as much as
their Lives were worth, if they deliver'd not up their Ships to the
<hi>French;</hi> whereupon ſome of them would have come away, and
left their Ships, and fled into <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon <hi>Pennington</hi>'s coming to <hi>Diep,</hi> he delivered the <hi>Van-Guard</hi>
abſolutely into the <hi>French</hi> Power, to be employed as they pleaſed,
and acquainted the reſt of the Captains with the King's Command,
that they ſhould likewiſe put their Ships into the <hi>French</hi> Power;
which they all refuſed to do, unleſs they might have good Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for the Delivery of their Ships, or Satisfaction for them.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon <hi>Pennington</hi> went on Shore, and ſpoke with <hi>D'Efſiat,</hi>
and upon his Return told the Captains, they muſt rely upon the
Security peraffetted in <hi>England;</hi> whereupon the Captains weighed
Anchor, and prepared to be gone; upon which Captain <hi>Pennington</hi>
ſhot at them, and forced them all to come to an Anchor again,
except the brave Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorge</hi> in the <hi>Neptune,</hi> more brave
in running away from this abominable Action, than charging into
the midſt of an Enemy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:60932:84"/>
When the Captains came a-ſhore, they ſpoke with Mr. <hi>Nicholas,</hi>
who enforced them to come to a new Agreement, which you may
read in <hi>Ruſhworth, fol.</hi> 335. and to deliver up their Ships into the
<hi>French</hi> Power; but not one of them would take the <hi>French</hi> Pay in
the Expedition, but one Gunner, who was at his Return kill'd in
charging of a Cannon, not well ſpunged by him; and the Duke's
Secretary <hi>Nicholas</hi> had a Diamond Ring, and a Hat-band ſet with
Diamond-Sparks, given him by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, for his
pains taken in this noble Employment.</p>
                  <p>This was the ſecond noble Deſign of this grand Miniſter of
State <hi>Buckingham,</hi> whilſt King <hi>James</hi> lay unburied: we will now
proceed to the third; wherein you'll ſee how well <hi>Richlieu</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Service, in accommodating the <hi>French</hi> with a
Fleet to ſubdue the <hi>Rochellers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho the Duke did not perſonally manage the Treaty of the
<hi>French</hi> Marriage at <hi>Paris,</hi> as he did the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi> for the
Reaſons aforeſaid; yet none but he, now the whole Treaty was
conſummate, and ſo firmly performed on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> part, muſt
fetch the Queen to the King: and when all the mighty Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for the Magnificence of this mighty Duke were compleated,
away he hies to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he arrived the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> and
there he ſtaid the full term of ſeven Days, wherein he performed
more wonderful Exploits than he had done in ſo many Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at <hi>Madrid.</hi> And theſe we will take from the noble <hi>Nani,</hi>
who was out of the Reach of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Envy, or Flattery of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, and as near as I can, in his own Words, <hi>Anno 1625.
fol.</hi> 221, 222.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Buckingham</hi> being in <hi>France</hi> to carry back <hi>Charles</hi>'s Bride, it
ſeemed, that in the free Converſations of that Court, he had taken the
Boldneſs to diſcover ſomething of his Inclination to the Queen, whilst
the Cardinal was inflamed with the ſame Paſſion, or rather feigned to
be ſo, with Averſion in her, who with Vertue equal to the Nobleneſs of
Blood, equally deſpiſed the Vanity of the one, and abhorred the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the other: <hi>(I think</hi> Nani <hi>herein was miſtaken, as will ſoon
appear.)</hi> Whereupon the Factions ariſing among the Ladies of the Court
were not ſo ſecret, but the King was obliged to make a Noiſe, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
ſome; but the Contention between the two Favourites was for
Power, and <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who by reaſon of the Favour of the King in his
own Kingdom prevailed in Authority, procured <hi>Buckingham</hi> many
Mortifications and Diſguſts: The other was no ſooner arrived at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
with the Bride, but to make a ſhew of Power not inferiour, by ill
uſing her thought to revenge himſelf. The Catholick Religion ſerved
for a Pretext, whilſt the Family brought out of <hi>France,</hi> according to
Contract of Marriage, practiſed it: whence Diſguſts brake forth to
ſuch a degree, that the Minds of the Spouſes being alienated, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60932:85"/>
between the Crowns themſelves diſturbed, it looked as if Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
had been the Bride-maid at that Wedding. <hi>You'll hear more of
this hereafter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's obſervable, when Humour, not Counſel, governs Actions,
how it runs into the contrary Extreams. King <hi>James,</hi> in Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of being ſupplied of all his Wants by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match, in
great Diſpleaſure broke up the Parliament in the <hi>18th</hi> Year of his
Reign, and impriſoned many of the Members, for preſuming to
adviſe him againſt it; and this King expected the Parliament
ſhould make good all the Duke's Extravagancies, for the Tale
which the Duke told in Parliament, the 21 <hi>Jac.</hi> for breaking off
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match, when he kept back the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> as you
heard before, from making his Defence, and proving the contrary
of what <hi>Buckingham</hi> had told.</p>
                  <p>And ſo confidently was the King poſſeſſed that that Parliament
continued in the ſame Mood, that I have heard one of Sir <hi>Edward
Coke</hi>'s Sons ſay, that tho when King <hi>Charles</hi> came to the Crown
Sir <hi>Edward</hi> would have waited upon him in Teſtimony of his
Duty and Service, the King would not admit him into his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
yet the King ſent to know of him, whether he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
this Parliament, notwithſtanding the King's Death; which
Sir <hi>Edward</hi> ſaid could not be, for that upon the King's Death the
Diſſolution followed: yet upon the Election, not ten of the old
ſurviving Members but were choſen again.</p>
                  <p>This Parliament met upon the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1625. where the
King laid open to them, that the Buſineſs he called them for was,
that whereas they had adviſed him to break off the two Treaties,
which were for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match, and Recovery of the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi>
and that his Father being thereby engaged in a War for the
Recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> they would now aſſiſt him in the
carrying of it on. The Speech you may read in <hi>Ruſhworth, fol.
175,</hi> 176.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth</hi> is miſtaken, and I wonder <hi>Nalſon</hi> and <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
took no notice of it, that my Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry</hi> did ſecond
it; for it was my Lord Keeper <hi>Williams,</hi> whoſe quaint and learned
Speech you may read in the ſecond Book of the Life of the Keeper,
by the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield, fol.</hi> 9, 10. Nor was <hi>Williams</hi> diſplaced
till the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>October</hi> following, as you may ſee <hi>fol.</hi> 27.</p>
                  <p>The Commons, before they enter'd upon Grievances, Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Coke</hi> moving it, to ingratiate themſelves with the King, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him two entire Subſidies; and the laſt Parliament, but the
Summer before, gave his Father three Subſidies and three Fifteens,
which were more than ever any Parliament granted the King in
threefold the time before. But that we may better look forward,
look a little back.</p>

King <hi>James</hi> upon the Rreach of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match, put forth a

                  <p>Here was a Suſpenſion of the Laws with a Witneſs, by the King's
abſolute Will and Pleaſure, notwithſtanding all the Officers by
Law were under the Obligations of their Oaths to the contrary:
and for the firſt-Fruits of this Warrant the King granted upon the
<hi>10th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> a ſpecial Pardon to twenty <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſts, of all
Offences committed by them againſt the Laws.</p>
                  <p>Can any Man now believe, that the Parliament <hi>18th Jac.</hi> ſhould
be ſo jealous, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match would be a Door to let in a
Toleration of <hi>Popery,</hi> and therefore adviſed the King to break off
the Match with <hi>Spain;</hi> and yet this Parliament ſhould be ſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blind,
as not to ſee this put in Execution, at the Inſtance of the
<hi>French</hi> in this King's Reign; eſpecially whenas the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth)</hi> were the Engliſh Friends
and Allies, and with whom the Engliſh had a moſt beneficial and
gainful Trade for 22 Years in King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, whereby they
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60932:86"/>
became doubly more enriched, than in the 44 Years Reign of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth;</hi> whereas the <hi>French,</hi> as they were a Neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
were ever faithleſs and Enemies to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and
with whom it always had a Trade to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Loſs, as much to
the enriching <hi>France,</hi> as to the impoveriſhing the <hi>Engliſh?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Commons ſent Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> with a Meſſage
to the Lords to deſire their Concurrence in a Petition to the King
againſt Recuſants, which was agreed to, and preſented to the
King, who anſwered, <hi>That he was glad the Parliament were ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for Religion, and aſſured them, they ſhould find him as forward;
that their Petition being long, could not be preſently anſwered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor were the Commons leſs alarmed, at the countenancing the
<hi>Arminian</hi> Sect, whoſe Tenets, next to <hi>Laud,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi>
propagated; and about the latter end of King <hi>James</hi> his
Reign, publiſhed a Book entituled, <hi>A new Gag for an old Gooſe;</hi>
which the Parliament took notice of, and referred it to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who diſallowed it, and ſought to ſuppreſs it,
and ended in an Admonition given to <hi>Mountague:</hi> but after King
<hi>James</hi> his Death, who was an Enemy to theſe Tenets, <hi>Mountague</hi>
then printed it again, and dedicated it to King <hi>Charles,</hi> now <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>
and <hi>Laud</hi> ruled all.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Commons brought <hi>Mountague</hi> to the Bar of their
Houſe, and appointed a Committee to examine the Errors therein,
and gave Thanks to the Arch-biſhop for the Admonition to <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,</hi>
whoſe Books they voted to be contrary to the Articles eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Parliament, to tend to the King's Diſhonour, and Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of the Church and State, and took Bond of <hi>Mountague</hi> for
his Appearance.</p>
                  <p>But the King intimated to the Houſe, that the things determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
concerning <hi>Mountague,</hi> without his Privity, did not pleaſe him,
for he was his Servant and Chaplain in ordinary; and that he had
taken the Buſineſs into his own Hands: whereat the Commons ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much diſpleaſed.</p>
                  <p>This was the firſt Breach between the King and Commons: and
here let's ſee what haſty Steps <hi>Laud</hi> took to fulfil King <hi>James</hi> his
Prophecy of him, in making Diſſenſions, and to be a Fire-brand
to ſet the Nation on fire, by fomenting and exaſperating the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
in it. In this Act of <hi>Mountague,</hi> you may obſerve a twofold
Crime: Firſt his Contempt and Diſobedience to the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> (which <hi>Laud</hi> pretended ſo much to exalt) and to the
Parliament, that his Book being queſtioned in Parliament, and by
the Commons committed to the Arch-biſhop, who not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed
and ſuppreſſed it; but <hi>Mountague</hi> being admoniſhed againſt
it, he ſhould upon King <hi>James</hi> his Death preſume to reprint it,
in Defiance to the Metropolitan of <hi>England,</hi> contrary to his Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Obedience, and to the Commons; thereby to make a Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60932:86"/>
between the King and them. And ſecondly, his being ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious,
as to dedicate it to the King, thereby to engage the King
in defence of his Arrogance and Diſobedience; and for a Reward
of this ſpecial Piece of Service, before King <hi>James</hi> was two
Months dead, to be made the King's Chaplain in Ordinary, to be
thereby protected from Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>But if it be asked how it does appear, that <hi>Laud</hi> was concerned in
this Act and Promotion of <hi>Mountague;</hi> I anſwer, there is a threefold
Reaſon to induce the Belief of it: Firſt, the end for which this Book
was wrote, for Promotion of <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenets, whereof <hi>Laud</hi>
was ſo great a Stickler. Secondly, none elſe but <hi>Laud</hi> could have
ſuch an Aſcendant in things of this kind, and to cauſe to early
a Promotion for ſuch a piece of Service: but Thirdly, which
clears the Queſtion; when the King's Neceſſities cauſed him to
call another Parliament, about ſix or ſeven Months after, <hi>Laud</hi>
fearing the Commons falling again upon <hi>Mountague,</hi> as they did,
<hi>Laud</hi> ſounded the King by <hi>Buckingham,</hi> whether the King would
leave <hi>Mountague</hi> to the Parliament; and finding the King determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to do it, in great Zeal, ſaid, <hi>I ſeem to ſee a Cloud ariſing and
threatning the Church of</hi> England, <hi>God in his Mercy diſſipate it,</hi> as you
may read in <hi>Ruſh. f.</hi> 203. as if the queſtioning a ſeditious and a
diſobedient Fellow to his Superiour in the Church, were a Cloud
to threaten the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If <hi>Laud</hi> was the firſt that ſowed Diſſenſion between the King
and Parliament upon the Pretence of the Church of <hi>England,
Buckingham</hi> ſhall be the ſecond, upon the Account of the Church
of <hi>Rome:</hi> and herein you'll ſee the Temper of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to any
which ſhould preſume to give him good Counſel.</p>
                  <p>The Diſſenſion between the King and Commons began with
<hi>Mountague</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> where the Plague than raged, and all <hi>England</hi>
over, ſo that moſt of the Members ſhrunk away, to flee the Danger
of it, and thoſe that ſtaid were in danger of their Lives: This put
the King into a marvellous Strait what to do, for his Neceſſities,
as <hi>Buckingham</hi> managed Affairs, and his being imbroiled in the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> War, were ſuch as the Subſidies granted the King his
Father the laſt Year, and thoſe granted the King now, could not
ſupport.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the King calling a Council at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> what to
do, the King propoſed upon the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> to adjourn the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to <hi>Oxford;</hi> which was mainly favoured by the Duke: my
Lord Keeper <hi>Williams</hi> oppoſed the Propoſition for two Reaſons;
Firſt, That the Infection had overſpread the whole Land, ſo that
no Man that travelled from his own Home, knew where to lodg in
Safety; that the Lords and Gentlemen would be ſo diſtaſted to be
carried abroad in ſo mortal a time, that it's likely when they came
together, they would vote out of Diſcontent and Diſpleaſure;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60932:87"/>
that his Majeſty was ill counſelled to give Offences in the Bud of his
Reign, tho ſmall ones. Secondly, the Parliament had given two
Subſidies at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> tho they removed to <hi>Oxford,</hi> it is yet the
ſame Seſſions; and if they alledg, it is not the Uſe of the Houſe
to give twice in a Seſſions, (tho I wiſh heartily they would) yet
how ſhall we plead them out of Cuſtom, if they be ſtiff to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it? It is not fit for the Reputation of the King, to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a probable Hazard of a Denial. The Duke which heard this
with Impatience, ſaid, <hi>That publick Neceſſity muſt ſway more than one
Man's Jealouſy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Keeper hereupon beſought the King to hear him in private,
and acquainted the King,</hi> That the Duke had Enemies in the Houſe
of Commons, who had contrived Complaints, and made them ready to
be preferred, and would ſpend time at <hi>Oxford</hi> about them. And what
Folly were it to continue a Seſſions that had no other Aim, but to bring
the Duke upon the Stage? But if your Majeſty think that this is like
an Hectick, quickly known, but hardly cured; my humble Opinion is,
That the Malady or Malice, call it what you will, may ſleep awhile after
<hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> there is no time loſt in whetting the Sithe well. I hope
to give an Account by that time, by undertaking with the chief Stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
that they ſhall ſuperſede their Bitterneſs againſt your great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
and that Paſſage to your weighty Counſels may be made ſmooth
and peaceable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But why,</hi> ſaid the King, <hi>do you conceal this from</hi> Buckingham?
<hi>Good Sir,</hi> ſaid the Keeper, <hi>fain would I begin at that End, but he
will not hear me with Moderation:</hi> And becauſe it was the Miſhap
of the Keeper to give the firſt Notice of this Storm that was
gathering, the Duke in Defiance <hi>bid him and his Confederates do
their worſt,</hi> and beſought the King, that the Parliament might be
continued, and he would confront the Faction, tho he looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himſelf in that Innocency that he preſumed they durſt not
queſtion him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Will muſt be a Law; ſo on the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> the
Parliament was adjourned to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to meet the firſt of <hi>Auguſt:</hi>
But, to ſweeten them, the Keeper in the Preſence of both Houſes,
in the King's Name, promiſed them, That the Rigour of the Law
againſt Popiſh Prieſts ſhould not be deluded: Here ſee the Levity
of the King, and the Dominion <hi>Buckingham</hi> had over him; for
upon the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> the King cauſed a Warrant to be ſealed
to pardon ſix <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſts.</p>
                  <p>When the Parliament met at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Speaker had no ſooner
taken his Chair, but a <hi>Weſtern</hi> Knight enlarges the Senſe of his
Sorrow, that he had ſeen a Pardon for ſix Prieſts bearing teſt <hi>July
12th,</hi> whereas but the Day before it, when they were to part from
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Lord Keeper had promiſed in the King's Name,
before them all, that the Rigour againſt the Prieſts ſhould not be
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60932:87"/>
deluded. Hereupon the Members were in ſuch a Heat, that they
ſtrived who ſhould blame it moſt: What! their Hopes blaſted in
one Night? But for the Lord Keeper that brought the King's
Meſſage, and knew it beſt, and for a Biſhop to ſet the Seal to ſuch
a Warrant, for him to do wrong to Religion, it was enormous.
Hereupon Mr. <hi>Bembo,</hi> a Servant to the Clerk of the Crown, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
he brought the Writ to the Keeper to be ſealed, but it was
ſtopt; Mr. <hi>Devike,</hi> Servant to Sir <hi>Edward Conway,</hi> brought it
from his Maſter, but it could not ſpeed. It was my Lord of
<hi>Buckingham</hi>'s hard Hap to move the King to command the Warrant
to be ſealed, in his Sight, at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> the <hi>Sunday</hi> following.
The Commons hereupon turned about to clear the Keeper and
commend him; but what pleaſed the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> did
not pleaſe the Court at <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> where this had not pleaſed the
King.</p>
                  <p>The Commons in this Heat deſired a Conference with the Lords
in <hi>Chriſt-Church-Hall</hi> in the Afternoon, where Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>
open'd the Complaint ſharply againſt my Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> and like
an <hi>Orator</hi> did ſlide away with a ſhort <hi>Animadverſion</hi> upon the
Duke; the Commons enlarged hereon, that the Duke that put
the King upon this, was the higheſt in the King's Favour; and
that all the important Places of Honour, and Offices by Sea and
Land, were in his Diſpoſal; which you may read at large in the
Life of the Lord Keeper, <hi>par. 2. fol. 14, 15. tit.</hi> 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Keeper at <hi>Woodſtock</hi> was cenſured by the Duke and
his Creatures for this; the Keeper therefore unſent for, comes to
<hi>Woodſtoock,</hi> and thus applies himſelf to the Duke.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I am come unſent for, and I fear to diſpleaſe you: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
your Grace made me, I muſt and will ſerve you; though you are
one that will deſtroy that which you made, let me periſh: yet I deſerve
to periſh ten times, if I were not as earneſt as any Friend your Grace
hath, to ſave you from periſhing. The Sword is the Cauſe of a Wound,
but the Buckler is in fault if it do not defend the Body. You brought
the two Houſes hither, my Lord, againſt my Counſel; my Suſpicion is
confirmed that your Grace will ſuffer for it. What's now to be done,
but to wind up a Seſſion quickly? The Occaſion is for you, becauſe two
Colleges in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, and eight Houſes in the Town are viſited
with the Plague. Let the Members be promiſed fairly and friendly,
that they may meet again after <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> requite the Injuries done to
you with Benefits, not Revenge, for no Man that is wiſe will ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
angry with the People of <hi>England.</hi> I have more to ſay, but no
more than I have ſaid to your Grace above a Year paſt at <hi>White-hall;</hi>
confer one or two of your great Places upon your faſteſt Friends, ſo ſhall
you go leſs in Envy, and not leſs in Power. Great Neceſſities will excuſe
hard Propoſals and horrid Counſels: St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays it was a Punick
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60932:88"/>
Proverb in his Country, <hi>Ut habeas quietum tempus perde aliquid.</hi>
At the Cloſe of the Seſſions declare your ſelf to be forwardeſt to ſerve
the King and Commonwealth, and to give the Parliament Satisfaction.
Fear them not when they meet again in the ſame Body, whoſe ill Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I expect to mitigate; but if you proceed, truſt me with your Cauſe
when it comes into the Houſe of Lords, and I will lay my Life upon it,
I will preſerve you from Sentence, or the leaſt Diſhonour. This is my
Advice, my Lord; if you like it not, Truth in the end will find an
Advocate to defend it. <hi>The Duke replied no more but,</hi> I will look
to whom I truſt, <hi>and flung out of the Chamber with Menaces in his
Countenance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth, fol.</hi> 202. ſays, that the Keeper told the Duke in
<hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> when the Duke rebuked him for ſiding againſt
him, in that he engaged with <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
the Redreſs of Grievances, <hi>That he was reſolved to ſtand upon
his own Legs;</hi> and that the Duke ſhould anſwer, <hi>If that be your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
look you ſtand faſt.</hi> Where Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth</hi> had this, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell: but this being ſo unlike the Keeper's Carriage to the
Duke, both in King <hi>James</hi>'s time and after, and alſo to the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
before ſet forth by the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> who being the
Keeper's Chaplain, could have a better Inſpection herein than Mr.
<hi>Ruſhworth</hi> could have had; but eſpecially ſince the Reaſons which
the Keeper put into the King's hands, which you may read in the
Life of the Keeper, <hi>par. 2. tit.</hi> 18. to ſatisfy the King of his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
while the Parliament ſate at <hi>Oxford,</hi> being ſo contrary to what
Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth</hi> ſays, I incline rather to believe the Biſhop.</p>
                  <p>However, the Commons preſuming to enquire into <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s
Actions, are cenſured at <hi>Woodſtock</hi> for ſpiteful and ſeditious, and
therefore not fit to continue, but to be diſſolved; which being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
by the Keeper, with Tears and Supplications he implored
the King to conſider, there was a time when his Father charged him,
in the Keeper's Hearing, to call Parliaments often, and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
them, though their Raſhneſs might ſometimes offend him;
that by his own Experience, he never got good by falling out with
them. But chiefly, Sir, ſaid he, let it never be ſaid that you kept
not good correſpondence with your firſt Parliament; do not diſſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
ſo much Unkindneſs through all the Counties and Boroughs
of your Realm; The Love of your People is the <hi>Palladium</hi> of your
Crown. Continue this Aſſembly together to another Seſſion, and
expect Alteration for the better; if you do not, the next Swarm
will come out of the ſame Hive.</p>
                  <p>The Lords of the Council did almoſt all concur with the Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but it wanted <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Suffrage, who was ſecure that the
King's Judgment would follow him againſt all the Table. Thus
far the Biſhop.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:60932:88"/>
But there was another Cauſe which the Biſhop does not mention,
but Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth</hi> does, <hi>fol.</hi> 336. which cauſed the haſty Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Parliament. Captain <hi>Pennington</hi> was come to <hi>Oxford</hi>
from delivering the Fleet into the <hi>French</hi> Power, to give an Account
of the Reaſon of it; but by the Duke's means was drawn to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
himſelf, and not to publiſh in due time his Knowledg of the
Premiſes, as it ſhortly after appeared: and if this ſhould have been
made known, it would not have been in the Power of the Keeper
to have brought off the Duke from Sentence, or the leaſt Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
ſo upon the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Parliament was diſſolved;
but before their Diſſolution the Commons made this following
Declaration.</p>
                  <p>WE the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes of the Commons Houſe
of Parliament, being the Repreſentative Body of the whole
Commons of this Realm, abundantly comforted in his Majeſty's late
gracious Anſwer touching our Religion, and his Meſſage for the Care of
our Health, do ſolemnly vow and proteſt, before God and the World,
with one Heart and Voice, that we are reſolved, and do hereby declare,
that we will ever continue moſt Loyal and Obedient Subjects to our moſt
Gracious Soveraign Lord King <hi>Charles;</hi> and that we will in a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
time, and in a Parliamentary way, freely and dutifully do our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Endeavours to diſcover and reform the Abuſes and Grievances of
this Realm and State, and in like ſort to afford all neceſſary Supply to
his moſt excellent Majeſty upon his preſent Occaſions and Deſigns: Moſt
humbly beſeeching our ſaid dear and dread Soveraign in his Princely Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Goodneſs, to reſt aſſured of the true and hearty Affections of his
poor Commons; and to eſteem the ſame to be (as we conceive it is indeed)
the greateſt worldly Reputation and Security that a juſt King can have;
and to account all ſuch as Slanderers of the Peoples Affections, and
Enemies to the Commonwealth, that ſhall dare ſay the contrary. <hi>But
the mighty</hi> Buckingham <hi>ſhall not only dare to ſay, but dare to do the
contrary: ſo much eaſier is it, in ſuch a Reign, for a Favourite to
ruine a Nation, than for a Nation to have Juſtice againſt a Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here let's ſtay a little, and ſee what ſtate the King had brought
himſelf to, within leſs than five Months, after he became King.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he took <hi>Mountague</hi> to be his Chaplain, a virulent, ſeditious,
ill-natur'd Fellow, to protect him from his Contempt againſt his
Metropolitan and the Parliament, for publiſhing new-fangl'd Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
to the Diſturbance of the Peace of Church and State; and
when the Commons queſtioned <hi>Mountague</hi> for them, he took part
with him againſt them, alledging he had taken the Buſineſs into
his own Hands, whenas he took <hi>Mountague</hi> into his Power, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
him from the Juſtice of them and his Metropolitan, but never
took other Notice of <hi>Mountague</hi>'s Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:60932:89"/>
Secondly, He took upon him, in Compliance with a foreign
Prince and an Enemy to the Nation, to diſpenſe with the Laws
againſt <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts; which, by the Conſtitutions of the Nation,
he could not do.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He broke his Word with the Parliament concerning
the Execution of theſe Laws, within a Day, or two at moſt, after
he gave it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He made War upon the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> without any
Declaration of War; whereas juſt Princes demand Reparations for
Wrongs done, and endeavour to compound their Differences ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably,
and in caſe of Refuſal, then to proclaim War: and this not
only againſt his Father's Counſel, but the Advice of his Father's
Council.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Without the Advice of his Council, he lent the <hi>French</hi>
a Fleet to ſubdue the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> and the <hi>Reformed</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> tho
they had given him no Offence, and the <hi>French</hi> King had perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly
broke his Promiſe with his Father and himſelf, in denying
<hi>Mansfield</hi>'s Army to land.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, He had, againſt the Advice of his Father, broke the
Bonds of Amity between him and his Subjects, by the Diſſolving
of the Parliament, whereby he loſt the only Means to ſupport him
in his War againſt <hi>Spain:</hi> And now <hi>Buckingham</hi> ſtood ready pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
to engage him in a War againſt <hi>France;</hi> yet in this deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſtate no free Counſel muſt enter the King's Ears, which muſt
be open to nothing but what <hi>Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Laud</hi> infuſed; a ſad
Preſage to what follow'd, as well upon <hi>Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Laud,</hi> as
upon the King himſelf. Now let's ſee the Succeſs of the War
againſt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides the Fleet deſigned againſt <hi>Cales,</hi> the King fitted up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fleet, in conjunction with the <hi>Dutch</hi> States, to block up
<hi>Dunkirk,</hi> as well as he had lent a Fleet, in conjunction with the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> to ſubdue the <hi>Rochellers;</hi> but this being ſent out to Sea
about the middle of <hi>October,</hi> the moſt perilous Seaſon of all the
Year for great Ships to put to Sea, (a Conſideration either not
underſtood, or not regarded by our Land-Admiral <hi>Buckingham)</hi> a
terrible Storm aroſe, which ſeparated and diſperſed both Fleets ſo,
as gave the <hi>Dunkirkers</hi> an Opportunity to put to Sea with 22 Men
of War, and 4000 Land-Soldiers. This alarm'd the Council, leſt
theſe ſhould land either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> whenas in neither
any Proviſion was made to oppoſe them, eſpecially in <hi>England,</hi>
where the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> had Orders to diſmiſs 300 of the
Trained-bands of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> that were to ſecure <hi>Harwich:</hi> however,
it's fit here to mention the noble Act of that Earl, in building
<hi>Langard-Fort</hi> on <hi>Suffolk</hi> ſide, to ſecure the Entrance into the Port,
the moſt famous of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Eaſtern Coaſt, and which is yet
continued to this day. But the Seaſon of the Year was ſuch, as
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60932:89"/>
prevented this Fear; for I find no other Account of the Deſign
of the <hi>Dunkirk</hi> Fleet.</p>
                  <p>Nor had the Deſign upon <hi>Cadiz</hi> more Succeſs than that upon
<hi>Dunkirk;</hi> for a furious Storm aroſe in their Paſſage (it may be
the ſame which ſeparated the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> before <hi>Dunkirk)</hi>
which ſo ſcattered the Fleet, that of 80, no leſs than 50 were
miſſing for 7 Days.</p>
                  <p>This was but the Beginning of the Misfortunes of this miſerable
Expedition; for the Confuſion of Orders was ſuch, as the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Soldiers ſcarce knew who to command, or whom to obey:
ſo that when the Fleet arrived at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> a Conqueſt, which would
have paid the Charge of the Voyage, and to the Honour of the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> offered it ſelf; for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Shipping in the Bay of
<hi>Cadiz,</hi> lay unprovided of Defence, ſo as the ſurpriſing them was
both eaſy and feaſible: but this was neglected; and when the
Opportunity was loſt, the Army landed, and Sir <hi>John Burroughs</hi>
took a Fort from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but was forced to quit it again;
for the Soldiers finding therein great ſtore of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wines, ſo
debauched themſelves, that had the <hi>Spaniards</hi> known the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they were in, they might have deſtroyed them all.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon they were put on board again, and the General, my
Lord <hi>Wimbleton,</hi> deſigned to ſtay 20 Days to wait for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Plate-Fleet, which was daily expected from the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> but
the evil Condition of the Fleet, by reaſon of a general Contagion,
enforced the General to abandon the Hopes of ſo great a Prize: ſo
having effected nothing, he returned home with Diſhonour in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>
following.</p>
                  <p>This gave no ſmall Occaſion of Clamour, that a Fleet ſo well
provided and mann'd, ſhould land their Men in an Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and return without ſome honourable Action: but where the
Fault lay, could not be found out; nor was any puniſhed for fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to perform his Duty. Yet the General for ſome time was not
admitted into the King's Preſence, and ſome of the Colonels of his
Army accuſed him, and ſome Sea-men aggravated the Accuſation:
Hereupon the General was examined before the Council, and he
laid the Fault upon others in the Fleet, who let the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s
Ships paſs without fighting them, according to Order; and they
on the other hand ſaid, they had no Order from the General to
fight.</p>
                  <p>But how miſerable ſoever the Succeſs of this Fleet was, yet it
muſt not be, in the King's Judgment, aſcribed to any Improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
either in the ſetting forth, or Conduct after it; <hi>But to God's
Pleaſure (who is the Lord of Hoſts, and unto whoſe Providence and
good Pleaſure his Majeſty doth and ſhall ſubmit himſelf, and all his
Endeavours) not to give that Succeſs as was deſired.</hi> See the King's
Declaration for Diſſolving his ſecond Parliament, which you may
read in <hi>Ruſhworth, fol.</hi> 412.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:60932:90"/>
But ſince the King had no better Succeſs againſt the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> by open Force, upon the Return of the Fleet he gave ſtrict
Command, That no Subject of the Realm of <hi>England</hi> ſhould have
any Trade or Commerce with any of the Dominions of the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> or of the Arch-Dutchies in <hi>Flanders,</hi> upon pain of Confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of both Ships and Goods that ſhould be found upon Voyage
of Trade into any of their ſaid Dominions. But hereby the Loſs
manifoldly fell more upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> than <hi>Spaniards;</hi> for theſe
Trades, above all others, were the moſt beneficial and gainful to
the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and by the Peace which the King's Father made with
<hi>Spain</hi> and the free Trade which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> thereby enjoyed in
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Nation became doubly more enriched than
in the long Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which was double as long
as K. <hi>James</hi>'s, after he had made this Peace: Thus as the King by
breaking of the Parliament diſabled himſelf of Means for carrying
on the War againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo by this Inhibition of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to
trade with <hi>Spain,</hi> he diſabled his Subjects from giving him ſuch
Aſſiſtance as otherwiſe they might. But theſe were no Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
where <hi>Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Laud</hi> govern'd all: and thoſe worthy
and honourable Stateſmen, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the
Keeper <hi>Williams,</hi> and the noble Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> were not only
diſcountenanc'd, but diſgrac'd, and not permitted to come into
the Council.</p>
                  <p>How unſucceſsful ſoever the Expedition was, yet another Fate
attended that Fleet lent to the <hi>French;</hi> for the <hi>Dutch</hi> joining a
Fleet in conjunction with the <hi>French</hi> Fleet commanded by the
Duke of <hi>Momerancy,</hi> fought the Fleet of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſubdued it, and then reduced the Iſles of <hi>Rhee</hi> and <hi>Oleron</hi> to the
<hi>French</hi> Power. But tho the miſerable Fate of the <hi>Reformed</hi> began
here, yet the Diſhonour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation ſhall ſoon after fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it; ſo that now <hi>Richlieu</hi> might write, <hi>florebunt Lilia Ponto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho the King diſſolved the firſt Parliament to prevent their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> yet it was not in <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Power to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the King's Neceſſities, but they put him upon the Neceſſity
of calling another. And here you may ſee the little Artifices the
King's grand Miniſters of State put him upon for the attaining
his Ends, and how quite contrary they ſucceeded.</p>
                  <p>There were five Perſons whom the Duke took to be his Enemies
(if they were not ſo, he had given them Cauſe enough to be ſo)
two of them were Peers, and three of them Commoners; the Peers
were the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> the Commoners
were Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Phillips</hi> (a Perſon whoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
I revere, and ſhould be glad I knew any of his Deſcendants,
to whom I could acknowledg it) and Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth:</hi>
theſe Perſons, the Duke feared, would be leading Men in both
Houſes, and was reſolved, that to his Power he would keep them
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60932:90"/>
out. He was ſure the Earl and the Biſhop, as Peers of Common
Right, would have their Writs of Summons; and was as ſure the
other three would be choſen Members of the Houſe of Commons.</p>
                  <p>In looking a little back you'll better ſee forward. You have
heard how, by the Duke's Power, in King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, the
Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> was firſt kept back from coming into <hi>England,</hi> and
after he was come over, was kept under Reſtraint, and denied Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
into the King's Preſence, leſt he ſhould have ſpoiled the
Duke's fine Tale in Parliament concerning the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match: and
alſo after he had anſwer'd every Particular of it, without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
and that after King <hi>James</hi> had promiſed the Earl ſhould be
heard in Parliament againſt the Duke, as well as the Duke had
been againſt the Earl, King <hi>James</hi> fell ſick, and died thereupon
before the Parliament met again.</p>
                  <p>After King <hi>James</hi>'s Death, the Earl wrote a moſt humble Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to King <hi>Charles,</hi> imploring his Favour, and deſiring the Duke's
Mediation, which the Duke anſwered the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1625, that
the Reſolution was to proceed againſt him, without a plain and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Confeſſion of the Point, which he <hi>(the Duke)</hi> had formerly
required him to acknowledg; and in a courtly manner told him,
<hi>That he would adviſe him to bethink himſelf in time what would be
most for his good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the mean time the Earl received his Writ of Summons to the
Parliament; whereupon the Earl ſent to the Duke, that he would
do nothing but what was moſt agreeable to his Majeſty's Pleaſure;
which the Duke anſwered,</hi> I have acquainted his Majeſty with your
Requeſts towards him, touching your Summons to the Parliament,
which he taketh very well, and would have you rather make your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
for your Abſence, notwithſtanding your Writ, than to come your ſelf
in Perſon.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Earl deſired a Letter of Leave under the King's
Hand, for his Warrant; but inſtead thereof, he received from the
Lord <hi>Conway</hi> an abſolute Prohibition, and even to reſtrain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
him, as he had been in King <hi>James</hi>'s time, tho the Earl was
freed from it by King <hi>James:</hi> and in this Reſtraint the Earl con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
three Quarters of a Year; during which time, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
from all his Offices and Places he held during that King's
Life: and tho he had laid out the greateſt part of his Eſtate for
their Majeſties Service, and by their particular Appointment, he
could never be admitted ſo much as to clear his Accounts; yet
hereof the Earl never made the leaſt Complaint.</p>
                  <p>Upon the King's Coronation, when Princes uſually confer Acts
of Grace and Favour, the Earl addreſſed himſelf to the Duke,
and then became an humble Suitor to the King for his Grace and
Favour; to which he receiv'd an Anſwer ſo different from what
the King's Father and the King himſelf had given him, ſince the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60932:91"/>
Earl's Return into <hi>England,</hi> that the Earl knew not what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
to make of it.</p>
                  <p>After the Writs of Summons for the meeting of this Parliament
were out, the Earl addreſſed himſelf to my Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry,</hi>
to be a Suitor to the King in his behalf, that the Privilege, which
of right is due to every Peer, might not be denied him; which
not taking effect, the Earl petitioned the Houſe of Peers, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
to the King for his Writ, which was granted, but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with a Letter from the Keeper not to take his Place in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Briſtol</hi> was the worthieſt Stateſman in either of theſe King's
Reigns, and whoſe Integrity in all theſe Varieties of Employments,
none but <hi>Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Conway</hi> preſumed (at leaſt that I can
find, or ever heard of) ſo much as to carp at; ſo <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s quaint
and excellent, not pedantick Learning, both in Divinity, Hiſtory, the
Civil and Canon Law, and not a Stranger to our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> excelled
all others: Theſe were adorned with a lively and excellent Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
and with a wonderful promptneſs and preſence of Mind,
in giving Judgment in the moſt nice and ſubtile dark Points of
State, and accompanied with an indefatigable Induſtry in Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them. Theſe Parts were ſo well obſerved in him by King
<hi>James,</hi> that without any Solicitation of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> or any other,
but whilſt he ſolicited for another, the King conferr'd the Lord
Keeper's Place upon him, as you may read in his Life, <hi>fol. 52.
tit.</hi> 62. and after, unſought for, the King promiſed him the next
Avoidance of the Arch-biſhoprick of <hi>York,</hi> or any other Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Preferment; and ſo ſteddy ſtood he in King <hi>James</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
that <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Attacks could no ways ſhake him in it.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Chancery</hi> he mitigated the Fees, and all Petitions from poor
Men were granted <hi>gratis;</hi> and was ſo far from prolonging Suits,
that in the firſt Year he ended more than in ſeven Years before,
yet with ſuch Caution, that he would have ſome of the Judges,
but principally Sir <hi>Henry Hubbard,</hi> to be aſſiſting; ſo that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his Celerity in Diſpatch in all the five Years of his being
Lord Keeper, not one of his Orders, neither by Parliament, nor
by the Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> were ever revers'd.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> is much celebrated for the Speech he made
in the Convention of <hi>Notables,</hi> which you may read at large in
<hi>Howel</hi>'s Life of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> f. 162, 163, 164. to excite the <hi>French</hi>
to carry on the Cardinal's ambitious and ungodly Deſigns, after
the King had ſo prodigally expended not only his Father's Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
but doubly more than the ordinary Revenues of <hi>France</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Favourites, and the manifold Wars both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
which <hi>Richlieu</hi> had entangled him in.</p>
                  <p>Let any Man compare the Keeper's Speech at the opening the
firſt Parliament of King <hi>Charles,</hi> which you may read in the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60932:91"/>
Keeper's Life, the ſecond Part, <hi>f.</hi> 9, and 10. with that of <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s,
and judg if the Rhetorick and Elegancy of it comes any way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
that of his, (after the King's Father and this King had ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
much more than the Revenues of the Crown upon their
Favourites, and this King had entangled himſelf in the Articles of
the <hi>French</hi> Match, and without Means engaged himſelf in a War
with <hi>Spain,</hi> and that againſt his Father's and the Keeper's Advice)
in exciting the Parliament to a Compliance with the King's Will,
tho with a different Fate; for <hi>Richlieu</hi> attained his Ends by his
Speech, whereas the Keeper's Downfal was a Conſequence of his.</p>
                  <p>But above all, the Keeper excelled himſelf (if I may be Judg)
in three things; one was in his Speech in the <hi>Houſe of Peers,</hi> about
the <hi>Peers</hi> taking the Oaths; the ſecond, his Reaſons he gave the
<hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador <hi>Voll<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>cleer,</hi> againſt diſpenſing with our Penal
Laws againſt <hi>Romiſh Prieſts,</hi> which you may read at large in the
firſt Part of the <hi>Keeper's Life,</hi> fol. 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219,
220, 221, 222. The third <hi>Speech</hi> was, when the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>
moved the Houſe of Lords, in the Year 1640, that the Biſhops
might be expell'd the Houſe, not their Perſons, but their Order;
which you may read at large in the ſecond Part of the <hi>Keeper's
Life,</hi> from <hi>fol.</hi> 168, to 176. And ſure the Hiſtory of the <hi>Keeper's
Life</hi> had been a nobler Work, if it had been related without the
looſe and impertinent Gloſſes of the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> whereby
he does ſo often diſturb and break the Thread of the Story, and
by preaching himſelf, more than writing his Hiſtory, makes it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
ſo as it is difficult to purſue it. See the <hi>Speech</hi> in the
firſt Part of his Life, <hi>f.</hi> 76, 77.</p>
                  <p>After the Parliament was diſſolved at <hi>Oxford,</hi> all Heads were ſet
at work to find ſome fault againſt the Keeper, to out him of his
Place, but none could be found; hereupon they made a Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which the <hi>Keeper</hi> made to King <hi>James,</hi> That the Office of
Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper, ſhould be Triennial, ſo that
after three Years the King ſhould make another, and the <hi>Keeper</hi>
having enjoy'd the Place above four Years, to be the Reaſon that
he ſhould ſurrender the Seal.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Keeper</hi> had notice of this, in a pathetical Letter to the
King, (which you may read in his Life, in the ſecond Part, <hi>f. 24.)</hi>
he implores his Majeſty's Favour, that he may retire with an Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his Majeſty's Grace, and be admitted into his Preſence to
make ſome humble Requeſts to him, which the King granted.
The firſt of his Requeſts was for the King's Favour in general,
which the King granted, and gave him his Hand twice to kiſs
upon it. Secondly, That the King would take away none of his
Church-Preferments, as he had graciouſly promiſed, till he had
given him better in lieu of them: the King anſwered, <hi>It was his
Intention.</hi> Thirdly, That the King would remember his Father's
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60932:92"/>
Promiſe, ſeconded by him, that he would place him (the Keeper)
in as good a Biſhoprick, or Arch-biſhoprick, as he could: the
King ſaid, <hi>There was no ſuch place void; when any fell, it would be
then time enough to make his Requeſt.</hi> Fourthly, That his Majeſty
would diſmiſs him freely and abſolutely, without any Command
from the Table, but to leave it to the <hi>Keeper</hi>'s Diſcretion to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear:
the King ſaid, <hi>He ever intended it ſo, and never ſaid a word
to the contrary; but expected he ſhould not offend by voluntary Intruſion.</hi>
Fifthly, That the King would declare to the Lords, that the
<hi>Keeper</hi> had willingly and readily yielded to his Majeſty's Pleaſure,
and that he parted in the King's Favour and good Opinion, and
was ſtill his Servant: the King ſaid, <hi>He would, but that he looked
that no Petitions be made for him by any Man at that time, but only
for his Favour in general.</hi> Sixthly, The <hi>Keeper</hi> beſought the King
to make an Atonement with the Duke upon or without Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Information which the Duke received againſt him:
the King ſaid, <hi>It became not him, a King, to take up Quarrels between
his Subjects, and that the Duke had never expreſt any ſuch Enmity to
him, againſt him (the Keeper).</hi> Seventhly, The <hi>Keeper</hi> beſought
the King, that whereas the Keeper had a Penſion by Direction of
the King's Father, and wherewith the King was acquainted, of
2000 Marks <hi>per Annum</hi> to the Viſcount <hi>Wallingford,</hi> and had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed
3000 <hi>l.</hi> down upon it, either to buy the ſaid Penſion, or
extinguiſh it, or to aſſign it to be paid out of the Tenths or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies
of his Biſhoprick, as before he had appointed to receive it
out of the Exchequer: the King ſaid, <hi>Aſſignments were naught, but
he would take Order with his Treaſurer to buy it, or pay for it, as
ſhould be most convenient.</hi> Eighthly, The <hi>Keeper</hi> beſought the King
to beſtow the next Prebendary in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> upon his Library-keeper,
as his Father had promiſed, or that he might reſume his
Books again: the King ſaid, <hi>It was full of Reaſon.</hi> Ninthly, The
<hi>Keeper</hi> beſought the King to ratify a Grant made by his Father of
four Advowſons to St. <hi>John's-College</hi> in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> whereof two
he had bought with his Money, and two the King gave him for
the good of the Society: the King ſaid, <hi>He would ratify the Grant,
and give way to amend any Errors in the Form, or in paſſing of it.</hi>
Tenthly, The <hi>Keeper</hi> beſought the King, that he might retire to a
little Lodg which my Lord <hi>Sandys</hi> lent him, where the Lord <hi>Conway</hi>
might receive the Seal; which the King granted. Laſtly, The
<hi>Keeper</hi> beſought the King, that the King would not be offended
with him, if upon his Diſcharge Reports were made that he was
diſcontented, which he proteſted he was not, giving over ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably:
the King ſaid, <hi>He would do him that Juſtice, and that he
little valued Reports;</hi> and thereupon gave the Keeper his Hand to
kiſs at parting: which you may read in the ſecond Part of the
Keeper's Life, <hi>Tit.</hi> 28.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:60932:92"/>
But the Biſhop ſays in the next <hi>Tit.</hi> the forlorn Keeper felt
the Heavineſs of this Lightneſs, who thought he had obtained
much, but (excepting the four Advowſons confirmed to St. <hi>John's-College)</hi>
he miſt all that he ſought for and expected; nor could
he ever get a Farthing of his Penſion, nor bring it to an <hi>Audit</hi> to
his dying-day; nor did the Keeper's Enemies ſtop here, but
ſought to provoke againſt him the King's Diſpleaſure, with things
which were neither conſiſtent with the King's Honour, nor
ſcarce to be born by the Temper of Human Nature; and were ſo
haſty in it, that the King's Promiſe, that the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>
(now no more <hi>Lord-Keeper)</hi> ſhould enjoy the King's Favour, was
ſcarce three Months old, when they put not only the King out of
mind of his Promiſe, but the Biſhop out of the Duty of his Place,
but that <hi>Laud</hi> ſhould perform it, whether the Biſhop would or
not.</p>
                  <p>It has been ſaid with what Difficulty the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>
(for ſo we muſt now call him) procured <hi>Laud</hi> the Biſhoprick of
St. <hi>David</hi>'s; and the Biſhop ſtaid not there, but retained him in
his Prebendary at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and ſo after gave him a Living in
the Dioceſs of St. <hi>David</hi>'s of 120 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> to help his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue.
Theſe two laſt, being Additions to <hi>Laud</hi>'s Preferment,
coming from the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> voluntarily, and unſought for
by <hi>Laud,</hi> he by Mr. <hi>Winn</hi> returned his Thanks to the Biſhop with
this Expreſſion, <hi>His Life would be too ſhort to requite his Lordſhip's
Goodneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But theſe Favours were not eighteen Months planted when <hi>Laud</hi>
became the Biſhop's ſharpeſt Enemy, as you may read in the firſt
Part of his Life, <hi>f.</hi> 108. and his Malice grew ſo high, that the
Counteſs of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Duke's Mother, took notice of it,
which the Arch-biſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> takes notice of, <hi>Ruſhw. f.</hi> 144. as
well as the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As Acts of Grace and Favour uſually were accompany'd by our
Kings at their Coronation, ſo in this King's Reign the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
muſt be practiſed, not only to the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> but much
more to the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> for he was not only denied to do
his Homage to the King with the reſt of the Spiritual Lords at
the Coronation, but his Office as Dean of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in aſſiſting
the Arch-biſhop in the Solemnity of it; and yet this too muſt be
done by <hi>Laud,</hi> as the Biſhop's Subſtitute, whether he would or
not.</p>
                  <p>This was the firſt noble Favour the King extended to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
according to his reiterated Promiſe, when they parted. The
ſecond was, he was denied his Writ of Summons as a Peer in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
which met in four days after the Coronation, <hi>viz. Feb.</hi> 6.
which was due <hi>ex debito Juſtitiae,</hi> and which was never denied to
Priſoners, or condemned Perſons even in his Father's time; and at
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60932:93"/>
laſt, when he obtained it, yet he muſt not preſume to ſit in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and had much ado to have his Proxy left with the Biſhop
of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Andrews,</hi> as you may read in the ſecond Part
of his Life, <hi>f.</hi> 69.</p>
                  <p>But tho the Privilege of Peers a little eclipſed the Power of
the mighty <hi>Buckingham,</hi> yet he was reſolved to keep Sir <hi>Edward
Coke,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Phillips,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> out of the
Commons Houſe by the King's Prerogative (as it has been of late
uſed) in making them Sheriffs, whether they be returned by the
Coroner's Inqueſt of the Counties or not; and by this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> was made Sheriff of the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi>
Sir <hi>Robert Phillips</hi> of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> of <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi>
It made a mighty Noiſe and an Inquiry, which otherwiſe
would not have been, that Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> in his extream Age,
now 77 Years old, and who had been Chief Juſtice of both
Benches, and Privy-Counſellor, ſhould be made a Sheriff of the
County, and the more, for that Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> took Exceptions
to the Oath of a Sheriff, whereupon it was altered.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the Counſels which govern'd this King in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
of his Reign. Now let us ſee the Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>The Commons were ſo far from granting Subſidies now, as in
the laſt Parliament, before Grievances were redreſt, that upon their
firſt Meeting they fell upon Examination of Grievances, and the
Miſcarriage of the Fleet at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> the evil Counſellors about the
King's Miſgovernment, and Miſimployment of the King's Revenue,
and an Account of the three Subſidies and three Fifteenths
granted the <hi>21ſt</hi> of King <hi>James:</hi> That new Impoſitions and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies
were multiplied, and ſettled to continue by Grants;
Cuſtoms enhanced by the new Book of Rates; and that Tunnage
and Poundage was levied, tho by no Act of Parliament; and the
Guard of the Seas neglected.</p>
                  <p>However, theſe were Generals, but the firſt Particular fell upon
<hi>Mountague</hi> in five particular Articles, wherein he had broken the
Laws and Statutes of the Realm, and diſturbed the Peace both of
the Church and Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>1. Whereas by the Articles of the <hi>Convocation</hi> holden in the
Year 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>62, it is determined, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is, at
preſent, and has been for above 900 Years paſt, ſo far wide from
the Nature of a <hi>true Church,</hi> that nothing can be more; he, the
ſaid <hi>Mountague,</hi> in ſeveral places of the Book called, <hi>The Anſwer to
the Gagg,</hi> and his other Book called, <hi>The Appeal,</hi> adviſedly affirms
and maintains, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is and ever was a true
Church ſince it was a Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Whereas in the <hi>16th</hi> Homily of the ſecond Book of Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
it is declared, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not built upon the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60932:93"/>
Foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles; and in the <hi>23d</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> overthrows the Nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and in the <hi>25th</hi> Article, that the five other Sacraments are
not to be accounted Sacraments; yet he the ſaid <hi>Mountague</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
in his Book, called, <hi>The Anſwer to the Gagg, That the Church
of</hi> Rome <hi>hath ever remained firm upon the ſame Foundation of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
and Doctrine inſtituted by God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. In the <hi>19th</hi> of the ſame Article it is maintained, That the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath erred not only in their Living and Matters
of Faith, and Ceremonies; he, in his Book called, <hi>The Gagg,</hi> does
maintain, that none of theſe are controverted in their Points be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> and tho in the <hi>35th</hi> Article it
is reſolved, that the Sacrifice of Maſſes, in which it is commonly
ſaid the Prieſt did offer Chriſt for the <hi>Quick</hi> and the <hi>Dead,</hi> to
have Remiſſion of Pain and Guilt too, is a blaſphemous Fable, and
dangerous Deceit, this being one of the controverted Points be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> he, in
his Book called, <hi>The Gagg,</hi> does maintain, <hi>That theſe controverted
Points are of a leſs and inferiour Nature, of which a Man may be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
without any danger of his Soul at all; and a Man may oppoſe
this or that without peril of periſhing for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Whereas in the ſecond Homily, entituled, <hi>Againſt the Peril
of Idolatry,</hi> and approved by the <hi>37th</hi> Article, it is declared, That
Images teach no good Leſſon, neither of God or Godlineſs, but
all Error and Wickedneſs; he, the ſaid <hi>Mountague,</hi> does maintain,
<hi>Images may be uſed for the Inſtruction of the Ignorant, and Excitation
of Devotion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. That in the ſame Homily it is plainly expreſſed, That the
attributing certain Countries to Saints, is a ſpoiling God of his
Honour, and that ſuch Saints are but <hi>Dii tutelares</hi> of the <hi>Gentile
Idolaters;</hi> yet the ſaid <hi>Mountague,</hi> in his Book entituled, <hi>A Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
concerning the Invocation of Saints,</hi> affirmed and maintained,
That the Saints have not only a Memory, but a more peculiar
Charge of their Friends; and that it may be admitted that ſome
Saints have a peculiar Patronage, Cuſtody, Protection and Power,
as Angels alſo have over certain Perſons and Countries by ſpecial
Deputation, and that it is not Impiety ſo to believe. And whereas
in the <hi>17th</hi> Article it is reſolved, That God has certainly decreed
by his Counſel, ſecret to us, to deliver from Curſe and Damnation
thoſe whom he hath choſen in Chriſt out of Mankind, to bring
them by Chriſt to everlaſting Salvation; wherefore they which be
endued with ſo excellent a Benefit of God, be called according to
God's Purpoſe, working in due ſeaſon, they through Grace obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Calling, they be juſtified freely, walk religiouſly in good
Works, and at length by God's Mercy attain to everlaſting Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city:
He the ſaid <hi>Mountague,</hi> in his Book called, <hi>The Appeal,</hi>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:60932:94"/>
does maintain, That Men juſtified may fall away and depart from
the State they once had, and may again ariſe, and become new
Men poſſibly, but not certainly nor neceſſarily. And the better
to countenance this Opinion, he hath in the ſame Book wilfully
added, and falſly charged divers Words in the ſaid <hi>16th</hi> Article,
and in the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and ſo miſrecited and changed
the ſaid Places he does alledg in his ſaid <hi>Appeal,</hi> endeavouring
thereby to lay a moſt malicious and wicked Scandal upon the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> as if he did herein differ from the Reformed
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and from the Reformed Churches beyond the
Seas, and did conſent to thoſe pernicious Errors which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> and which the late famous Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
and King <hi>James</hi> of happy Memory, did ſo piouſly and
diligently labour to ſuppreſs.</p>
                  <p>That he had, contrary to his Duty and Allegiance, endeavoured
to raiſe Factions and Diviſions in the Commonwealth, by caſting
the odious and ſcandalous Name of <hi>Furitans</hi> upon ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
themſelves to the Doctrine and Ceremonies of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> under that Name laying upon them divers falſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Imputations, ſo to bring them into Jealouſy and Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
with the King, and Ignominy and Reproach of the People,
to the great danger of Sedition, and diſturbance of the State, if
it be not timely prevented.</p>
                  <p>That the Scope and End of his Books is, to give Encouragement
to Popery, and to withdraw the King's Subjects from the true
Eſtabliſhed Religion to the Roman Superſtition, and conſequently
to be reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereby God's true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
has been ſcandaliz'd, thoſe Miſchiefs introduced which the
Wiſdom of many Laws hath endeavoured to prevent, the Devices
of his Majeſty's Enemies furthered and advanced, to the great
danger of the King and all his loving Subjects.</p>
                  <p>That he has inſerted in his Book called <hi>The Appeal,</hi> divers Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
diſhonourable to the late King, full of Bitterneſs, Railing,
and injurious Speeches to other Perſons, diſgraceful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
to many worthy Divines of this Kingdom, and other
Reformed Churches beyond the Seas; impious and profane in
ſcoffing at Preaching, Meditating and Conferring, Pulpits, Bibles,
and all ſhew of Religion; all which do aggravate his former Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
having proceeded from malicious and enormous Heat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Peace of the Church, and the Sincerity of the Reformed
Religion publickly profeſſed, and by Law eſtabliſhed in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
All which Offences being to the Diſhonour of God, and
of moſt miſchievous Effect and Conſequence againſt the Church
and Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> and other of his Majeſty's Realms
and Dominions, the Commons aſſembled in Parliament do hereby
pray, that the ſaid <hi>Richard Mountague</hi> may be puniſhed according
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60932:94"/>
to his Demerits, in ſuch exemplary mannner, as may deter others
from attempting ſo preſumptuouſly to diſturb the Peace of the
Church and State; and that the Books aforeſaid may be ſuppreſſed
and burnt.</p>
                  <p>This was that ſpecial Stick of Wood which <hi>Laud,</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this young King's Reign, put into his Hand, to ſupport
him in the eſtabliſh'd Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and
afterwards planted him to be one of the Cedars of our Church,
by having him made firſt Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> and after of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However <hi>Laud</hi> was ſo nettled with the Votes of the Commons;
I do not find <hi>Buckingham</hi> concerned himſelf in them, it may be
believing this might divert the Storm from him: but it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for the Commons, in looking into the Grievances of the
Nation, but to meet <hi>Buckingham</hi> in the Front of every one of
them: And when they began their Debates concerning the Duke,
they received a Meſſage from the King of the preſſing State of
<hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and with what Care and Patience he expected their
Reſolutions of Supplies, and to let them know, he look'd for a full
and perfect Anſwer of what they would give for his Supply, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Expectation, and their Promiſes; and that he would
not accept of leſs than was proportionable for the Greatneſs and
Goodneſs of the Cauſe; and that it was not fit to depend any
longer upon Uncertainties, whereby the whole Weight of the
Affairs of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> may break in upon us upon the ſudden, as
well to his Diſhonour, as the Shame of the Nation; and when this
is done, they may continue longer, and apply themſelves to the
Redreſs of Grievances, ſo they do it in a dutiful and mannerly Way,
without throwing an ill Odor upon his preſent Government, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Government of his late bleſſed Father. You will hear
further of the Care he took of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> in his Reply to the
Commons Addreſs upon this.</p>
                  <p>The Commons, in anſwer, beſeech the King to reſt aſſured,
that no King was ever dearer to his People than his Majeſty, no
People more zealous to maintain and advance his Honour and
Greatneſs, and eſpecially to ſupport that Cauſe wherein his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
and Allies are now engaged; and beſeech his Majeſty to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Advice of his Parliament, which can have no other end
but the Service of his Majeſty, and the Safety of his Realm, in
diſcovering the Cauſes, and propoſing the Remedies of thoſe great
Evils which have occaſioned his Majeſty's Wants, and his Peoples
Griefs.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, in Aſſurance of Redreſs herein, they really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to aſſiſt his Majeſty in ſuch a way, and in ſo ample a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
as may make him ſafe at home, and feared abroad; and for
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60932:95"/>
diſpatch whereof, they will uſe ſuch Diligence, as his urgent and
Preſſing Occaſions require.</p>
                  <p>The King, in anſwer to the Commons, tells them, he takes the
Cauſe of their preſenting Grievances, to be a <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> and
not a <hi>Condition;</hi> and will be willing to hear their Grievances, ſo as
they apply themſelves to redreſs Grievances, and not enquire after
Grievances: That he will not allow any of his Servants to be
queſtion'd by them, much leſs ſuch as are of eminent Place about
him; that the old queſtion was, <hi>What ſhall be done to the Man
whom the King honours?</hi> But now it hath been the Labour of ſome
to ſeek what may be done againſt him whom the King thinks fit to
honour; he ſaw they ſpecially aimed at the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi>
and wonders what had altered their Affections to him, when in the
laſt Parliament of his Father's time he was their Inſtrument to
break the Treaties, for which they did ſo honour and reſpect him,
that all the Honour conferred upon him was too little: He wot not
what had chang'd their Minds; but aſſures them, that the Duke had
not meddled with, or done any thing concerning the Publick, but
by his ſpecial Directions, and was ſo far from gaining any Eſtate
thereby, that he verily thinks the Duke rather impaired the fame.
He would have them haſten the Supplies, or it will be the worſe
for them; for if any Ill happens, he thinks he ſhall be the laſt that
ſhall feel it.</p>
                  <p>The Commons had yet freſh in Memory the Diſſolution of the
Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> about ſix Months before, and what Truſt
there was to this King's Word for Redreſs of Grievances, ſo as it
was done in a dutiful and mannerly Way, after they had given
Money; and therefore they little altered their Courſe from what
they had done at <hi>Oxford,</hi> yet more than Parliaments heretofore
did, to have Grievances firſt redreſs'd, and then to give Supplies;
for they voted to proceed upon Grievances, and to give the King
three Subſidies, and three Fifteenths.</p>
                  <p>This gave the Duke little Satisfaction: ſo that the King himſelf
became the Duke's Advocate, and told the Commons in a Speech,
which you may read in <hi>Ruſhw. fol.</hi> 225. that he came to inform
the Commons of their Errors and unparliamentary Proceedings, ſo
that they might amend their Faults: which was enlarged by my
Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry,</hi> who told them of the King's Neceſſities,
and his Patience in Expectation of Supplies, and of the King's
Promiſe of Redreſs of Grievances, after Supplies were granted;
That the Enquiry upon ſundry Articles againſt the Duke upon
<hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>n Fame,</hi> was to wound the Honour and Government of his
Majeſty, and of his renowned Father, and therefore it was his
Majeſty's final and expreſs Command, that they yield Obedience to
thoſe Directions which they formerly receiv'd, and ceaſe their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parliamentary
Proceedings againſt the Duke, and leave to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60932:95"/>
Care, Wiſdom, and Juſtice the future Reformation of thoſe
things, which they ſuppoſed to be otherwiſe than they ſhould be;
and that the King took notice, that they had ſuffered the greateſt
Council of State <hi>(The Duke and Laud)</hi> to be cenſured and tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by Men, whoſe Years and Education cannot attain to that
Depth, <hi>(Why then were the old Members kept out of the Houſe, which
could have better informed them?)</hi> and that the three Subſidies, and
three Fifteenths were no ways proportionable to ſupply the King's
Neceſſities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and concludes, that his Majeſty doubts not but after
this Admonition, they will obſerve and follow it, which if they do,
his Majeſty is moſt ready to forgive all that is paſt. Then the
King added, that in his Father's time, by their Perſwaſion, he was
their Inſtrument to break off thoſe Treaties; and that then no Body
was in ſo great Favour with 'em as the Man they ſeem now to touch,
but indeed his Father's Government, and his; and that Parliaments
are altogether in his Power for their Calling, Sitting and Diſſolution;
and as he finds the Fruits, they are to continue, or not to be.</p>
                  <p>But if the Commons Proceedings againſt the Duke were er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
and unparliamentary, and through the Duke's Sides
wounded not only the King's Government, but that of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Father, and that the young Men in this Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
had cenſured and traduced the King's higheſt Council of
State; you ſhall now hear of an old Stateſman in the Houſe of
Lords, which ſhall not only ceaſe the Wonder, which cauſed the
Parliament in the <hi>21ſt</hi> of King <hi>James,</hi> ſo to applaud the Duke,
but ſhall wound the whole Story, which begat that great Applauſe
to the Duke.</p>
                  <p>You have heard before how the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> was ſtopp'd at
<hi>Calais</hi> from coming over into <hi>England,</hi> after his Return out of
<hi>Spain;</hi> and after he came to <hi>Dover,</hi> when the Duke could not
prevail upon Marquiſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Hertford,</hi> to have
the Earl ſent to the Tower upon his Arrival in <hi>England;</hi> how he
was ſtopp'd by a Letter from the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> that he ſhould not
come to Court, nor to the King's Preſence, till he had anſwered
to ſome Queries which his Majeſty would appoint ſome of the
Lords of the Council to ask him, which was not done till the
Parliament was adjourned, and never met more; and how after
King <hi>James</hi>'s Death the Earl was not only kept from his Liberty,
and the King's Preſence, but removed from all his Offices and
Employments, and not ſuffered to come to an Account for the
Moneys expended in the King's Service; and not permitted to come
to the Parliament which was diſſolved at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the King's Summons of this Parliament, the Earl peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the King to have his Writ of Summons, which was never
denied to any Peer, to aſſiſt in the Houſe of Peers; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
an Anſwer by the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> That the King was no
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60932:96"/>
ways ſatisfied in it, and propounded to the Earl, <hi>Whether he
would rather ſit ſtill, and enjoy the Benefit of the late King's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
in Parliament, or to wave it, and put himſelf upon Trial, for his
Negotiation in</hi> Spain; <hi>and one of theſe he muſt trust to, and give a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Anſwer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earl, in Anſwer, ſaid, He had been already queſtion'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
20 Articles, by a Commiſſion of the Lords, and had given ſuch
Anſwers, that their Lordſhips never met more about that Buſineſs;
and that he did not wave the Pardon granted by King <hi>James</hi> in
Parliament. Theſe Letters you may read at large in <hi>Ruſhworth,
fol.</hi> 138, 139, 140.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Earl petitions the Houſe of Lords, ſhewing, that
he being a Peer of this Realm, had not received his Writ of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to Parliament, and deſires their Lordſhips to mediate with
his Majeſty, that he may enjoy the Liberty of a Subject, and the
Privilege of his Peerage, after almoſt two Years Reſtraint without
any Trial brought againſt him; and that if any Charge be brought
againſt him, he prays he may be try'd by Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Lords petition the King, that not only the Earl of
<hi>Briſtol,</hi> but all ſuch other Lords whoſe Writs are ſtopt, except
ſuch as are made uncapable to ſit in Parliament, by Judgment of
Parliament, or ſome other legal Judgment, may be ſummoned.</p>
                  <p>This nettled the Duke to the quick, ſo that he told the Houſe
the King had ſent the Earl his Writ, but withal deliver'd ſuch a
Letter, which the King ſent to the Earl, which I care not to
tranſcribe, but you may read it in <hi>Ruſhworth, fol.</hi> 241. wherein
this great Stateſman <hi>Buckingham</hi> would have the Earl judged and
cenſured by the King, without hearing the Earl, and thereby fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal
the Judgment of the Lords againſt the Earl.</p>
                  <p>It's true indeed, my Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry</hi> ſent the Earl a Writ
of Summons to attend in Parliament, but withal ſignified by a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Earl, that it was his Majeſty's Pleaſure withal, <hi>(no doubt
but by the Advice of his highest Council of State)</hi> that the Earl
ſhould continue in the ſame Reſtraint he was, ſo that he forbear
his perſonal Attendance in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>But ſince the Duke could no longer otherways keep the Earl
out of the Houſe of Lords, the King, by my Lord Keeper, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to the Lords, that his Pleaſure was, they ſhould ſend for the
Earl as a Delinquent, to anſwer Offences committed againſt him
before his going into <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſince his coming back, and his
ſcandalizing the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> immediately, and by Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon himſelf, with whoſe Privity and Direction the Duke
guided his Actions, and without which he did nothing. And now
Sir <hi>Robert Heath,</hi> the King's Attorney-General, exhibited eleven
Articles againſt the Earl <hi>(it was thought fit to leave out the other
nine)</hi> which the Earl had anſwered to King <hi>James,</hi> without any
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60932:96"/>
Reply; and in the laſt of theſe the Earl is charged with giving the
King the Lie, in offering to falſify that Relation which his Majeſty
affirmed, and thereunto added many things of his own Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
to both Houſes of Parliament; which you may read at
large in <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>'s <hi>Collections,</hi> from <hi>fol.</hi> 153, to 158.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Earl exhibited a Charge of High Treaſon and
Miſdemeanours, in twelve Articles, againſt the Duke, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againſt the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> of High Miſdemeanours, which you
may read at large in <hi>Ruſhworth,</hi> from <hi>fol.</hi> 266, to 270. And upon
the Delivery of them, the Earl deſired a Copy of the King's Charge
againſt him in Writing, and time allowed to anſwer, and Counſel
aſſigned him; and ſaid there was a great Difference between the
Duke and him, for the Duke was accuſed of Treaſon, and at large,
and in the King's Favour, and that he, being but accuſed of that
which he had long ſince anſwered, was a Priſoner, and therefore
moved the Duke might be put in equal Condition; which tho the
Houſe did not, yet were not ſatisfied to commit the Earl to the
Tower, and order'd, That the King's Charge againſt the Earl
ſhould be firſt heard, and then the Earl's againſt the Duke; yet
ſo that the Earl's Teſtimony againſt the Duke be not prevented,
prejudiced, or impeached.</p>
                  <p>The King, in a Meſſage to the Lords by my Lord Keeper, would
have blaſted the Earl's Articles againſt the Duke for two Reaſons
(if they may be called ſo.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The firſt was, That the Narrative made in the</hi> 21 Jac. <hi>in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
trenches as far upon him as the Duke, for that he went
therein as far as the Duke.</hi> But what then? Shall not the Earl be
heard in his Defence against that Declaration which was deſigned to
blast the Earl's Honour and Integrity? and Juſtice is no Reſpecter of
Perſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The other was, That all the Earl's Articles have been cloſed in
his Breaſt now theſe two Years, contrary to his Duty, if he had
known any Crime of that nature againſt the Duke; and now he
vents it by Recrimination againſt the Duke, whom he knows to
be a principal Witneſs to prove his Charge againſt the Earl.</hi> This
is ſtrange; for his Majeſty's Reign was ſcarce yet a Year old, and all
this while the Earl was under a Reſtraint, and not permitted to come
to the Parliament, which ended at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and in his Father's
Reign, after the Earl had anſwered all the Duke's Articles against
him, without any Reply, King <hi>James</hi> promiſed him he ſhould be heard
against the Duke, as well as he was against him, tho he lived not to
make good his Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Now let's ſee the Levity of this Prince, the neceſſary Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
of Wilfulneſs, and which he purſued in every ſtep of his
Reign, without any Remorſe that I could ever find; for the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the King's Charge againſt the Earl in the Houſe of Lords
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60932:97"/>
was ſcarce cold, whenas it was endeavoured to take the Earl's
Cauſe out of the Houſe, and to proceed againſt him in the King's-Bench.
<hi>But why must this be at this time of day, and while a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
was ſitting? And why was not this done in the King's Father's
Life, or in this King's Reign? And why must two years paſs, and
this way of charging the Earl never thought of, which now must be done
in all haſte?</hi> But the Lords put a full ſtop to this, and for theſe
Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>1. For that in all Cauſes of moment, the Defendants ſhall have
Copies of all Depoſitions, both <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>contra,</hi> after Publication,
in convenient time before hearing, to prepare themſelves; and if
the Defendants will demand that of the Houſe in due time, they
ſhall have learned Counſel to aſſiſt them in their Defence: And
their Lordſhips declared they would give their Aſſents thereto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in all Cauſes, as well Civil as Criminal and Capital, they
hold, that all lawful Help could not, before juſt Judges, make one
that is guilty avoid Juſtice; and on the other ſide, God defend
that an <hi>Innocent</hi> ſhould be condemned.</p>
                  <p>2. The Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> by his Petition to the Houſe, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of his Reſtraint, deſiring to be heard here, as well in point of
his Wrongs, as in his Accuſations againſt the Duke; whereof his
Majeſty taking Conſideration, ſignified his Pleaſure by the Lord
Keeper, <hi>April</hi> 20, That his Majeſty was reſolved to put his Cauſe
upon the Honour and Juſtice of this Houſe; and that the Earl
ſhould be ſent for as a Delinquent, to anſwer the Offences he
committed in his Negotiations, before his Majeſty's going into
<hi>Spain,</hi> whilſt his Majeſty was there, and ſince his Return; and that
his Majeſty would cauſe theſe things to be charged upon him in
this Houſe, ſo as the Houſe is fully poſſeſſed of the Cauſe, as well
by the Earl's Petition as the King's Conſent, and the Earl brought
up to the Houſe as a <hi>Delinquent,</hi> to anſwer his Offences there: and
Mr. Attorney hath accordingly delivered the Charge againſt him
in the Houſe, and the Earl alſo his Charge againſt the Duke.</p>
                  <p>And now, if the Earl be proceeded withal by way of the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi>
theſe dangerous Inconveniencies will follow.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. He can have no Counſel.</item>
                     <item>2. He can uſe no Witneſs againſt the King.</item>
                     <item>3. He cannot know what the Evidences againſt him will be in
convenient time to prepare for his Defence, and ſo the Innocent
may be condemned; which may be the Caſe of any Peer.</item>
                     <item>4. The Liberty of the Houſe will be thereby infringed, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Juſtice of it declined, contrary to the King's Pleaſure,
expreſly ſignified by my Lord Keeper: all which are expreſly
againſt the Order.</item>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:60932:97"/>
                     <item>5. The Earl being indicted, it will not be in the Power of the
Houſe to keep him from Arraignment, and ſo he may be diſabled
to make good his Charge againſt the Duke.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Therefore the way to proceed according to the Directions and
true Meaning of the Order, and the King's Pleaſure ſignified, and
preſerve the Liberties of the Houſe, and protect one from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
will be,</p>
                  <p>To have the Charge delivered into the Houſe in Writing, and
the Earl to ſet down his Anſwer in Writing; and that the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
on both ſides be examined, and Evidences on both ſides
heard, by ſuch Courſe and manner of Proceedings as ſhall be
thought fit by the Houſe: And if upon a full Hearing, the Houſe
ſhall find it Treaſon, then to proceed by way of Indictment; if
doubtful in point of Law, to have the Opinion of the Judges to
clear it; if doubtful in Matter of Fact, then to refer it to a legal
Trial at Law; and that the rather, for that,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. It appears that the Earl, in the ſpace of two Years (till now
he complained) has not ſo much as been queſtioned for Matter of
Treaſon.</item>
                     <item>2. He has been examined upon twenty Interrogatories, and the
Commiſſioners ſatisfied, that his Anſwer would admit of no Reply.</item>
                     <item>3. The Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> by ſeveral Letters, hath intimated, that
there is nothing againſt him, but what was pardoned by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of the <hi>21st</hi> of <hi>Jac.</hi> and ſignified his Majeſty's Pleaſure,
that he might reſt in that Security, and ſit ſtill.</item>
                     <item>4. That his Majeſty had often declared to the Counteſs of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,</hi>
and others, that there was neither Treaſon nor Felony againſt
the Earl, nor ought elſe but what a ſmall Acknowledgment
would expiate.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The Earl, in Conformity to this Order, anſwered every Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
of the King's Charge againſt him, without any Reply; but it
would be a wonderful Diſcovery, to find an Anſwer to any one
Particular of the Earl's Charge, either againſt the Duke, or my
Lord <hi>Conway.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Commons, at the ſame time, impeached the Duke of high
Miſdemeanours, in a Charge of thirteen Articles, whereof that of
the Death of King <hi>James</hi> was one; but to the Diſpleaſure of the
King, ſo far as to commit Sir <hi>Dudley Diggs</hi> and Sir <hi>John Elliot</hi> to
the Tower for it: and the Commons ſent a Meſſage to the Lords
by Sir <hi>Nathaniel Rich,</hi> by an unanimous Vote, to commit the
Duke to ſafe Cuſtody; which I do not find the Lords did, nor
did the impriſoned Members lie long in the Tower; for the King
ſignified to the Houſe, that Sir <hi>Dudley Diggs</hi> did not ſpeak the
Words for which the King committed him, and ſoon after Sir <hi>John
Elliot</hi> was diſcharged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:60932:98"/>
                     <hi>However, the Commons ran high againſt the Duke, with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,</hi>
That till he were removed from meddling with State-Affairs,
they were out of all hopes of any good Succeſs, and did fear that any
Money which they ſhall or can give, will, through his Miſemployment,
rather he turned to the Hurt and Prejudice of this Kingdom than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
as by lamentable Experience they have lately found in thoſe large
Supplies they had formerly and lately given.</p>
                  <p>But the Duke, thus doubly ſtormed both by the Earl and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and utterly unprovided to defend himſelf againſt either;
and the King, rather than receive the <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> the Commons
had prepared to preſent him againſt the Duke, reſolved to part
with the Parliament rather than the Duke, and thereby loſt four
Subſidies and three Fifteenths, tho the Houſe of Peers petitioned
to the contrary: This was upon the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1626.</p>
                  <p>The King having ſent the Parliament home again, ſends a long
Declaration after them, wherein he magnifies his Power of Calling,
Adjourning, Proroguing, and Diſſolving Parliaments peculiarly
belonging to himſelf, by an undoubted Prerogative inſeparably
united to his Imperial Crown, of which, as of all his other <hi>Royal
Actions,</hi> he is not to give any Account, but to God only, whoſe
immediate Lieutenant and Vicegerent he is in theſe his Realms
and Dominions, by Divine Providence committed to his Charge;
yet his Purpoſe is, ſo to order himſelf and all his Actions, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Weal of his Kingdoms, as may juſtify themſelves not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his own Conſcience, and to his own People, but to the
whole World: He thought fit to make a true, plain, and clear
Declaration of the Reaſons that enforced him to diſſolve theſe two
laſt Parliaments, ſo that the Mouth of Malice it ſelf might be
ſtopt, and the deſerved Blame of ſo unhappy Accidents may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fall upon the Authors thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King ſays, That when he came firſt to the Crown, he
found himſelf engaged in a War againſt a potent Enemy.</hi> Who
was that Enemy? Or at what time was any Declaration of any War
made either against his Father or him? Which after the best Search I
could ever make, I could never find any; yet this I find, that the
next day after his Father's Death, he and his Favourite the Duke were
ſo eager to make a War against the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that a day muſt
not be lost, but Writs must be iſſued out to ſummon a Parliament, to
give Subſidies to make War against <hi>Spain. See the ſecond Part of
the Keeper</hi> Williams'<hi>s Life,</hi> fol. 4. tit. 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This War, the King ſays, was not undertaken raſhly, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
juſt and honourable Grounds, but enforced for the neceſſary
Defence of himſelf and his Dominions.</hi> If this War were for the
neceſſary Defence of the King and his Dominions, there must be ſome
Body that did thus offend the King and his Dominions; but who this
is, the King neither ſays, nor can I find.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:60932:98"/>
                     <hi>For the Support of his Friends and Allies.</hi> This is general, ſo
no particular Anſwer can be given to it: but who theſe Friends and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
were which were to be ſupported, the King neither ſays, nor can
I find.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For redeeming the antient Honour of this Nation.</hi> It had need,
for it was never ſo blaſted as in his Father's and his own Reign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the Recovery of the Patrimony of his dear Siſter, her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort,
and their Children, injuriouſly, and under colour of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Friendſhip, taken from them.</hi> The King's Father, to make
good the Narrative which this King and <hi>Buckingham</hi> made of the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Treaty, told the Parliament he was deceived by Generals,
and that <hi>doloſus verſatur in generalibus.</hi> If the King would have
ſatisfied the World how his Brother-in-law's Patrimony was taken
from him by Colour of Treaties and Friendſhip, he ſhould have ſet forth
the Treaties and Friendſhip, and by whom, and when ſought; and by
whom, and when broken: but of this the King ſays not one word, and
therefore that which he ſays ſtands for nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And for the Maintenance of the true Religion.</hi> Were the Ships
which he and <hi>Buckingham</hi> last Year ſent to ſubdue the <hi>Rochellers,</hi>
who had never given him or his Father any Offence, for the Defence
of the true Religion? If this was not, what was it this King did for
the Defence of the true Religion?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And invited thereunto, and encouraged therein, by the humble
Advice of both Houſes of Parliament.</hi> What! all this by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of both Houſes of Parliament? I cannot find the Parliament,
21 <hi>Jac.</hi> ever invited his Father to any more, than to break off the
Treaties of the Prince's Match with <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate:</hi> But
what if upon the Miſinformation of the Duke <hi>ex parte,</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had done all this? yet, whenas the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> had twice
blaſted the Duke's Narrative in every particular, without any Reply,
Why might not another Parliament, upon better Information, alter
what the Parliament 21 <hi>Jac.</hi> had done? Which neither of theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
did, but granted and voted him and his Father greater Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
than ever before were given to any of his Predeceſſors in three-fold
the time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But when the King enter'd into a View of his Treaſure, he
found how ill provided he was to proceed effectually with ſo great
an Action.</hi> It ſeems by this one Action, the King only deſigned the
War againſt <hi>Spain:</hi> But why does not the King ſet forth the Cauſes
why his Treaſure was ſo ill provided? It was not ten Months before
his Father's Death, that the Parliament 21 <hi>Jac.</hi> which gave his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
three Subſidies, and three Fifteenths, was adjourned; and his
firſt Parliament gave him two Subſidies more, within two or three
Months after his Father's Death: And what came of all this, but
the raiſing ten thouſand Foot and two thouſand Horſe, under <hi>Mansfield,</hi>
the Expedition againſt the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> and to <hi>Cadiz?</hi> to neither of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60932:99"/>
which latter he was ever invited by his Father, or any Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The King makes the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lague to be the Cauſe of the Diſſolution
of the Parliament at <hi>Oxford; yet he might as well have ſecured the
Members by a Prorogation, as Diſſolution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in this Parliament, he tells how the Houſe of Commons
voted him three Subſidies and three Fifteenths, and after four
Subſidies and three Fifteenths, and of the Letter he ſent them the
<hi>9th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> to ſpeed the paſſing theſe Supplies; and how that
the Houſe, being abuſed by the violent and ill-adviſed Paſſion of a
few Members, never ſo much as admitted one Reading to the Bill
of Subſidies, but voted a <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> or <hi>Declaration,</hi> which they
intended to prefer to him (tho palliated with gloſſing Terms)
containing many diſhonourable Aſperſions upon his Majeſty, and
upon the ſacred Memory of his deceaſed Father; which his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
taking for a Denial of the promiſed Supplies, upon mature
Adviſement he diſſolved them. <hi>But from whence ſhould this mature
Adviſement come? We do not find the Privy Council had any hand in
it, and the Houſe of Lords petitioned against it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But leſt the Credit of this Declaration ſhould not find Faith
enough againſt the Commons Repreſentatives, the King ſends a
Proclamation after it, wherein he takes notice of a <hi>Remonſtrance</hi>
drawn by a Committee of the late Commons, to be preſented to
him, wherein are many things to the Diſhonour of himſelf, and
his Royal Father of bleſſed Memory, and whereby, through the
ſides of a Peer of this Realm, they wound their Soveraign's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
and to vent their Paſſions againſt that Peer, and prepoſſeſs
the World with an ill Opinion of him, before his Caſe was heard
<hi>(who hinder'd it)</hi> had ſcatter'd Copies of it. Wherefore the King,
to ſuppreſs ſuch an unſufferable Wrong, upon pain of his Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and high Diſpleaſure, commanded all who had Copies
thereof to burn them. <hi>But why was not the Duke's Cauſe heard?
and who diſſolved the Parliament to prevent it? Had not the Earl of</hi>
Briſtol <hi>anſwered every Particular of the King's and Duke's Charge
against him? And was there not an Order of the Houſe of Lords, the
Duke ſhould anſwer the Earl's Charge againſt him? Where is this
Anſwer to be found? and why was it not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſee the Juſtice of this King, and how he made good his
Promiſe in his Declaration, that he would ſo order his Actions, as
ſhould juſtify him, not only in his own Conſcience, but to the
whole World; for the very Day the Parliament was diſſolved, he
committed the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> Priſoner to the Tower, and left the
Duke free, to purſue his ungodly Deſigns.</p>
                  <p>Here I'll ſtay a little, and add this Augmentation of Honour to
the Eſcutcheon of this noble Earl, notwithſtanding this Uſage: For
when the Long Parliament, in 1640, had put a full Stop to the
King's <hi>Abſolute Will and Pleaſure,</hi> which if it had not, God only
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60932:99"/>
knows where it would have ended; and after that this King's Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
and Favourites, his Lord Keeper <hi>Finch,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Winde-bank,</hi>
had run into other Countries, to ſave themſelves from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hanged in this; and that the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> after he had
flatter'd this King and his Father in all the Shapes of Earl, Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
Baron, Lord Chief Juſtice, Lord Privy Seal, Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer,
and Lord Preſident of the Council; and his Son, and the
Earls of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and both the Sir <hi>Henry Vanes,</hi>
Father and Son, and Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay,</hi> &amp;c. ſided with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
againſt the King; yet this noble Earl followed the King
in all his Adverſity, however he had been perſecuted by him in
his Proſperity.</p>
                  <p>The late Keeper, as he gave his Opinion againſt the War with
<hi>Spain</hi> in King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, ſo did he againſt the Expedition
againſt <hi>Cales</hi> in this King's Reign: his Reaſon was, which you
may read in the ſecond Part of his Life, <hi>fol. 65. That the King
muſt make himſelf ſure of the Love of his own People at home, before he
bid War to ſuch a rich and mighty Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Keeper</hi>'s Counſels were as much feared and hated by the
Duke, as <hi>Briſtol</hi>'s and the Commons Articles were againſt him;
and therefore he reſolved to be rid of them all, and purſue the
King's and his own Deſigns, without any Controul; and the very
ſame Day the Parliament was diſſolved, he cauſed the Earl of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol</hi>
to be committed to the Tower, as you may ſee in <hi>Stow</hi>'s <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle,
fol.</hi> 1042. Nor would he have his Renown and Valour leſs
known abroad, than his Juſtice at home; and <hi>France</hi> ſhall now
be the Theatre upon which he will act it, in ſpight of <hi>Spain,</hi> or
the Parliament and Nation of <hi>England,</hi> without whoſe Aſſiſtance
he will act Wonders, by his own Power, and in Vindication of his
own Honour: however, ſome Cauſe muſt be ſhewed by others,
ſince the Duke concealed the true Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ruſhworth, fol.</hi> 427. makes the Cauſes of this War to begin
between the Prieſts of the Queen's Family, and the Biſhops, by
Articles of Agreement upon the Marriage; and that the Pope
had declared them Apoſtates, if they ſhould ſeek for any Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
from the King, being an Heretick; and that the Queen
ſided herein with the Prieſts againſt the King, and that Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
hereupon grew between them; ſo as the King informed
his Brother of <hi>France,</hi> he could no longer bear them. And much
to this purpoſe has Mr. <hi>James Howel</hi> in the Life of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII.
<hi>fol.</hi> 75.</p>
                  <p>But theſe were but Pretences for this War; the Cauſe was of
another Complexion: And herein we will cite the Authority of
the great <hi>Nani,</hi> who had better Means to enquire into the Cauſes
than either <hi>Ruſhworth</hi> or <hi>Howel,</hi> and was not biaſs'd by Intereſt,
Affection, or Flattery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:60932:100"/>
You have heard before of the Emulation between <hi>Richlieu</hi> and
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> and of their Inclinations for the Queen's Favour, and
of the Queen's noble Averſions to them both: but I think <hi>Nani</hi>
was therein a little miſtaken; for, if I be not miſinformed, as I
think verily I am not, when <hi>Buckingham</hi> came out of <hi>France</hi> with
the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> he left, or ſoon after ſent Sir <hi>Balthazer
Gerbier</hi> to hold ſecret Correſpondence between the Queen and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and tho <hi>Richlieu</hi> watch'd <hi>Gerbier</hi> narrowly, yet he brought
the Queen's Garter, and an exceeding rich Jewel to <hi>Buckingham</hi>
from her.</p>
                  <p>Upon the breaking out of the Feuds in the Queen's Family,
which began almoſt as ſoon, if not before it was ſettled, <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
prevails with the King to be ſent into <hi>France</hi> to compoſe
them, which was granted. But <hi>Nani</hi> ſays, the true Motive of
<hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Journey being aſcribed to Love, contracted in that
Court, <hi>Richlieu</hi> perſwaded the King to refuſe him Entrance into the
Kingdom. <hi>The Rage hereupon of the other was inflamed to extremity,
and ſware, ſince he was forbidden to enter in a peaceable manner into</hi>
France, <hi>he would make his Paſſage with an Army.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here you ſee the Duke was under a double Obligation, of Love
and Honour; and ſince he could not attain his End in Love, it's
remarkable by what Steps he proceeded to make good his Oath
and Honour of entering into <hi>France</hi> with an Army; which will be
better obſerved if they be look'd upon in their Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>It was the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1625, in the firſt Year of the King's
Reign, as you may ſee in <hi>Ruſhworth,</hi> fol. 335. that <hi>Buckingham</hi>
cauſed the Captains of the Fleet under the Command of Vice-Admiral
<hi>Pennington,</hi> to deliver it into the French Power to fight
againſt the <hi>Rochellers;</hi> and while the Fleet was thus in the <hi>French</hi>
Power, and after the Duke had received the horrible Affront of
being denied Entrance into <hi>France</hi> in a peaceable and loving man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> following, <hi>viz.</hi> about ſix Weeks after the
delivery of the Fleet, the Duke, as Lord High Admiral of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
by an extraordinary Commiſſion, ſeized the <hi>St. Peter</hi> of
<hi>New-haven (John Mallerow</hi> Maſter) laden with Goods, Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
and Money, to the value of 40000 <hi>l.</hi> upon the account of
Monſieur <hi>Villiers,</hi> Governor of <hi>New-haven,</hi> and other French Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
as Prize; and the Duke took out of the ſaid Ship ſixteen
Barrels of Cochineal, eight Bags of Gold, three and twenty Bags
of Silver, two Boxes of Pearl and Emeralds, a Chain of Gold,
and Monies and Commodities to the value of 20000 <hi>l.</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
them to <hi>Gabriel Marſh</hi> his Servant: Whereupon there was
an Arreſt of two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant Ships in <hi>New-haven</hi> upon the
<hi>7th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> following, <hi>viz.</hi> 1625. whereupon by a Petition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
from the Merchants, the King ordered, <hi>December</hi> the <hi>28th,</hi> that
the Ship and Goods belonging to the <hi>French</hi> ſhould be re-delivered
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60932:100"/>
to the <hi>French;</hi> upon this the Court of Admiralty decreed upon
the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> following, that the Ship with all the Goods
(except three hundred <hi>Mexico</hi> Hides, ſixteen Sacks of Ginger, one
Box of gilded Beads, and five Sacks of Ginger) ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed
from further Detention, and delivered to the Maſter; yet
the Duke not only detained to his own uſe the ſaid Gold, Silver,
Pearl, Emeralds, Jewels and Money, but upon the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi>
following, without any legal Proceedings, cauſed the ſid
Ship to be again arreſted and detained, as you may ſee in <hi>Ruſhw.
f.</hi> 312. And here began the ſeizing of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships in <hi>France,</hi>
which the Duke makes one of the Cauſes of the War.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But this is but a Charge of the Commons upon the Duke,
and therefore no direct Proof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not to be preſumed the Commons would have charged
theſe things thus particularly and poſitively without Proof; and
I ſay moreover, they are to be taken for Truth, ſince the King
did diſſolve the Parliament, rather than the Duke ſhould come to
his Trial upon the Commons impeaching him hereupon; and 'tis
worth Obſervation, to ſee how without Counſel, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Extreams, the King and Duke engaged in both the Wars
againſt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France.</hi>

                  <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> in the ſecond Part of the Life of the
Lord Keeper <hi>Williams, f. 4. tit.</hi> 2. ſays, The next day after King
<hi>James</hi>'s Death, the King and Duke were buſied in many Cares,
but the chief was, for the Continuation of the Parliament at
King <hi>James</hi>'s Death: the Keeper ſhewed that the Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
with the Death of the King; then the King ſaid, <hi>Since
Neceſſity required a new Parliament, his Will was that Writs forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
be iſſued out of</hi> Chancery <hi>for a new Choice, and not a day loſt.</hi>
The Keeper hereupon craved leave to be heard, and ſaid, It was
uſual in times before, that the King's Servants and Friends did
deal with Counties, Cities and Boroughs where they were known,
to procure a Promiſe for their Elections before the preciſe time
of any inſequent Parliament was publiſhed; and that the ſame
Forecaſt would be good at this time, which would not ſpeed if
the Summons were divulged before they look'd about them. The
King anſwered, <hi>It was high time to have Subſidies granted for the
War with the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>and the Fleet muſt go forth for that
purpoſe this Summer.</hi> To which the Keeper replied in few words,
and with ſo cold a Conſent, that the King turned away and gave
him leave to be gone, whereas the King diſſolved this Parliament,
and loſt four Subſidies and three Fifteenths, to ſave the Duke, and
make War upon <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:60932:101"/>
                     <hi>Concealing the true Reaſon for this War with</hi> France, <hi>the Duke
in his Declaration gives two other Reaſons of it; the firſt was, the
refuſal of</hi> Mansfield <hi>to land his Army at</hi> Calais, <hi>according to
Agreement, whereby the Deſign for the recovery of the</hi> Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<hi>was fruſtrate.</hi> But why muſt this be a Reaſon at this time of
day? for this was done in the Reign of King <hi>James;</hi> and when the
Treaty of the Marriage with <hi>France</hi> was in being, Why was not then
the Treaty broke off upon it? And why after this in King <hi>Charles</hi>'s
Reign, was the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet put into the Power of the <hi>French</hi> to
ſubdue the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> and this Buſineſs of <hi>Mansfield</hi>'s not ſo much as
taken notice of?</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon was, The <hi>French</hi> ſeizing our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
Ships in their Ports. <hi>But this was after the Duke had ſeized
and made Prize of the</hi> St. Peter <hi>of</hi> Newhaven; <hi>ſo here the Duke
begins making Prize upon the</hi> French, <hi>and makes War upon them for
doing ſo by the</hi> Engliſh. However we have here a Declaration and
Reaſon of a War againſt the <hi>French,</hi> ſuch as 'twas, tho none could
be had for the War with <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here you may ſee the unhappy Fate of Princes who treat their
Subjects as Enemies, and their Flatterers and Favourites as their
only Friends and Confidents: for notwithſtanding the King's ill
Succeſs laſt Year to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and the King's Complaint for want of
Money in the Exchequer, and the ill terms he was at with his
Subjects, not only to be put upon making a War againſt the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Emperor, but now alſo againſt the King of
<hi>France,</hi> and to have none but <hi>Buckingham, Laud,</hi> &amp;c. and their

                  </p>
                  <p>For the Charges to maintain theſe Wars, almoſt againſt <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
the King requires a Benevolence of the Subject, and the
Nobility to lend freely: Demands a Loan of 100000 <hi>l.</hi> from the

Souldiers, and makes the Country pay their Quarters; the Rich

Theſe were the Ways this King took to juſtify his Integrity for the
Weal of the Kingdom, ſo as to ſatisfy not only his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but his People, and the whole World, as he promiſed in
his Declaration for Diſſolution of the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>But leſt the King's Royal Proclamation for theſe things ſhould
be ſtumbled at, or diſputed, <hi>Sibthorp</hi> and <hi>Manwaring</hi> (two ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial

is not bound to obſerve the Laws of the Land in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and that his Royal Will in impoſing Loans and Taxes does

                  <p>Tho theſe things were ſettled to the Duke's Heart's Content,
yet he had a Jealouſy, that in his Abſence the Arch-biſhop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> might give the King ſuch Counſel, as might ſpoil all the
Glories of the Duke's Deſigns; and therefore to remove him not
only from the Council-Table, but far enough out of the way from
coming into the King's Preſence, is the Deſign: but to put ſome
colour upon it, it was reſolved, That the King, by a ſpecial Meſſage,
ſhould order the Arch-biſhop to licenſe <hi>Sibthorp</hi>'s Sermon under
his own Hand.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-biſhop at this time was ſorely afflicted with the Stone,
and kept his Bed; when Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> brought the King's Command
to him, the Biſhop could not forbear to take notice of the piece
of Drudgery to be put upon him, the like whereof was never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
to any of his Predeceſſors, yet deſired my Lord <hi>Conway</hi> to
leave the Sermon with him ſome ſmall time to peruſe, which my
Lord did.</p>
                  <p>The Biſhop, inſtead of licenſing the Sermon, made Obſervations
upon it, how falſe and inconſiſtible the Parts of the Sermon were
to one another, and how contrary to Antiquity and the Authority
of the Scripture; for one part of the Sermon juſtified <hi>Ahab</hi>'s
taking away <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard, and he deſired to be ſatisfied about
his Objections before he licenſed the Sermon.</p>
                  <p>This gave the deſired Offence: for upon the Arch-biſhop's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal
to licenſe the Sermon, the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> (who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<hi>John Coſins</hi> his Book, called, <hi>The ſeventh Sacrament,</hi> with
all the Errors which were after expunged) gave it a great and
ſtately Allowance, and <hi>Laud</hi> was ordered to anſwer the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop's
Objections, and had the Biſhops of <hi>Durham, Oxford</hi> and
<hi>Rocheſter</hi> to be his Aſſiſtants in it; and to this the Arch-biſhop
muſt reply without ſeeing the Anſwer, which if he might ſee, he
ſaid he would batter it all to pieces; which being denied, you may
read in <hi>Ruſhw. f.</hi> 446, 447. how the Arch-biſhop did batter it all
to pieces upon Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> his reading it.</p>
                  <p>For this ſpecial piece of Service in anſwering the Arch-biſhop's
Objections, the Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> and <hi>Laud</hi> of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi>
are made Privy-Counſellors; and for the Arch-biſhop's refuſal to
licenſe <hi>Sibthorp</hi>'s Sermon, he was not only baniſhed to his Houſe
at <hi>Ford,</hi> five Miles beyond <hi>Canterbury</hi> (a mooriſh unhealthy Place)
and that before he could lay in his Proviſions for Houſe-keeping,
but the Office of High-Commiſſion is taken from him, and the
Exerciſe of it committed to the Biſhops of <hi>Durham, Oxford, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi>
and <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> which had ſo well anſwered the Arch-biſhop's
Objections to <hi>Sibthorp</hi>'s Sermon: And now things are thus
ſettled at home.</p>

In <hi>July</hi> the <hi>27th</hi> the Duke is commiſſionated Admiral, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of a <hi>Navy Royal</hi> of 100 Sail, and 6 or 7000 Land Souldiers:
and when he came before <hi>Rochel, Sobiez</hi> came aboard of him,
where, for ſeveral Reaſons, it was agreed to land the Army on the
Iſle of <hi>Oleron,</hi> and not on the Iſle of <hi>Rhee;</hi> but <hi>Sobiez</hi> going to
perſwade the <hi>Rochellers</hi> to join with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Duke before
his return lands on the Iſle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> in ſpite of the Oppoſition
made by the <hi>French;</hi> but inſtead of purſuing the Blow, not only
neglects to take the Fort <hi>la Prie,</hi> to ſecure his Retreat, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the <hi>French</hi> from landing Supplies, but ſtays five days, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>Toiras</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Governor encouraged his Men, and alſo got
more Force and Proviſions into the Cittadel of St. <hi>Martins.</hi> The
<hi>French</hi> were ſo alarm'd at this Invaſion, that the King offered the
Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> and the <hi>Rochellers</hi> any Terms to join againſt the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> which both refuſing, cauſed both their Ruins.</p>
                  <p>So that the Duke having made three falſe Steps, <hi>viz.</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<hi>Sobiez,</hi> his not marching after landing, and not taking in
the Fort <hi>la Prie,</hi> now let's ſee a fourth. The Enemy's Retreat
upon the landing of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> was ſo haſty, that they quitted a
Well about twenty Paces from the Counterſcarp which ſupplied
the Cittadel with Water; which not being poſſeſt upon the firſt
coming of the Army, the <hi>French</hi> drew a Work about it which
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could not force, and without which Well the beſieged
could not have ſubſiſted; however, the Duke reſolved to take the
Fort by Famine.</p>
                  <p>We have marked four falſe Steps the Duke made; now obſerve
the fifth, which was the loſs of the whole Army, and ruin of all the
Proteſtant Party in <hi>France:</hi> for inſtead of the <hi>French</hi> joining with
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for the recovery of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> by Land, the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
now join the <hi>French</hi> againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by Sea, to relieve St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins;</hi>
and the Duke inſtead of preſſing the Fort by a ſtrait Siege,
entertains a Treaty of Surrender with <hi>Toiras,</hi> and ſeveral Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
paſt between them, ſubſcribed, Your humble Servant, <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham;</hi>
and, Your humble Servant, <hi>Toiras;</hi> till <hi>Toiras</hi> got Relief
of Men, Victuals and Ammunition, and then <hi>Toiras</hi> broke off the
Treaty with the Duke.</p>
                  <p>Soon after the <hi>French</hi> landed Forces, by the neglect of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
to ſuppreſs them, and Orders were given to draw the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
out of the Trenches, which the <hi>French</hi> poſſeſs; whereupon the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> were forced to retreat, and fight the <hi>French</hi> to regain the
Trenches: at laſt the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> the Duke makes a vain
Storm upon the Caſtle, and was beaten off; and upon the <hi>8th</hi> the
Duke retreats, the <hi>French</hi> being now equal to him in Foot, and
ſuperiour in Horſe: when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were intangled in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
the Duke having neglected to take <hi>la Prie,</hi> or build a Fort
upon a narrow Lane and Cauſey (to ſecure their Retreat) the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60932:102"/>
                     <hi>French</hi> charged the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe in the rear, and rout them, who rout
the Foot in the narrow Paſſages between the <hi>Salt-pits;</hi> thoſe that
eſcaped were loſt in the <hi>Salt-Pits</hi> and Ditches, and the Crowd was
ſo great in paſſing a Bridg, that many were drown'd in the River:
yet in this Confuſion and Adverſity the Bravery of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
appear'd; for a few having paſt the Bridg, the <hi>French</hi> following, the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> rallied, and faced about to charge the <hi>French,</hi> who coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
retreated over the Bridg.</p>
                  <p>Except this little Action, yet as great in Fame as any other,
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation never received like Diſhonour, as in this looſe
and unguided Conduct of this laſcivious Duke in this Expedition,
of whom it may be truly ſaid, he was
<q>
                        <l>Mars ad Opus Veneris,</l>
                        <l>Martis ad Arma Venus.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Home he comes, and finds things as much in Diſorder here, as
he had left them in Diſhonour abroad: the Priſons full of the moſt
eminent Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> by a ſpecial Warrant from the King,
for refuſing to lend, as they were aſſeſs'd by the Commiſſioners for
the <hi>Loan,</hi> and Bail denied them upon return of their <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi>'s.
An Army was kept on foot, when this Expedition had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
all that which ſhould have paid them, which had not been
done in 80 Years before; the People fearing this was more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave
than defend them.</p>
                  <p>In this Confuſion Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s Advice is called for by the
King and Council, what's to be done; who in a long and well
compoſed Speech, beginning at <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> ſets forth the
Deſign of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> to attain an univerſal Monarchy
in theſe Weſtern Parts of <hi>Europe:</hi> How the Deſign was firſt check'd
by <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> againſt <hi>Charles,</hi> but more by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his Son <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> they following a free Council, and
thereby winning the Hearts of a loving People, ever found Hands
and Money for all Occaſions. That the only way to raiſe Money
ſpeedily and ſecurely, was the <hi>Via Regia</hi> by Parliament; other ways
were unknown, untrodden, rough, tedious, and never ſucceeded
well. That Religion lies neareſt the Conſcience of the Subject,
and that there was a Jealouſy of ſome Practices againſt it: and
that tho the Duke of <hi>Bucks</hi> had broken the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match out
of a Religious Care that the Articles demanded might endanger
the State of the Reformed Religion, yet being an Actor in
the <hi>French</hi> Match, as hard if not worſe paſſed than thoſe of
<hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Robert</hi> goes on, and enumerates the Miſcarriages in theſe
two laſt Years, the Waſte of the King's Revenue, the Preſſures
upon the publick Liberty of the Subjects, in commanding their
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60932:103"/>
Goods without Conſent in Parliament, impriſoning their Perſons,
without ſpecial Cauſe ſhewed; and this made good againſt them
by the Judges. How to obviate theſe he leaves to the prudent
Conſideration of the Council, but like old Sir <hi>Charles Harboard,</hi>
he wiſhes that the Duke might appear to be the firſt Adviſer
for calling a Parliament, ſo that the People may be ſatisfied, this
Parliament ſhould be called by the zealous Care and Induſtry of
the Duke.</p>
                  <p>Now the Hopes of getting Money by calling the Parliament,
works more than the Laws of God, or ſacred Juſtice could do:
for upon the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> Writs are iſſued out for the
Aſſembling of a Parliament, to meet the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> following;
the Priſon-Doors are opened, for the impriſoned Gentry to go
abroad; the Arch-biſhop, the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and Biſhop of
<hi>Lincoln</hi> (who tho now in Diſgrace, was the firſt Raiſer of <hi>Laud,</hi>
after Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury)</hi> have Writs

                  <p>But ſee the Unſtability of Reſolutions not founded in Truth,
Juſtice or Prudence: for the next Day after the Writs for ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning

granted a Privy-Seal to <hi>Burlemach,</hi> for 30000 <hi>l.</hi> to be returned to

<hi>England, February</hi> the <hi>28th,</hi> where was an Army already upon free
Quarter, and after grants a Commiſſion to 23 Lords and others to
raiſe Money upon Impoſitions, or otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus things ſtood in the State before the Meeting of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Now let's ſee how they ſtood in the Church. <hi>Barnevelt</hi>
having headed a Faction in <hi>Holland,</hi> which called themſelves <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,</hi>
and deſigning by them to have depoſed the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> loſt his Head for it about four Years before; now on the
contrary, the <hi>Arminian</hi> Faction here, which called themſelves the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> aſcribed all Dominion to the abſolute Power
of the King: The Principals of this Faction were <hi>Neal</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>cheſter, Laud</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s,</hi> and <hi>Richard Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi>
afterwards advanced to the Biſhopricks of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich;</hi>
this Faction was headed by the Duke. At this time the
Jeſuits had taken a Houſe at <hi>Clarkenwell,</hi> deſigning to make a
College of it, who in a Letter to the Father <hi>Rector</hi> of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> boaſt that they had planted the ſoveraign Drug
<hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> which they hoped would purge the Proteſtants from
their Hereſy, and that it flouriſhed, and bore Fruit in a due Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
and they proceeded by Counſel and Conſideration, how and
when to work upon the Duke's Jealouſy and Revenge; and in
that they gave the Honour to thoſe who merit it, which were the
<hi>Church Catholicks:</hi> they aſſured themſelves, they had made the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60932:103"/>
Duke and the Parliament irreconcilable; and that they have thoſe
of their Religion, who ſtand continually at the Duke's Chamber,
to ſee who comes in, and who goes out: They glory how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
in their Speech and Geſtures, they act the <hi>Puritans,</hi> and
the <hi>Cambridg</hi> Scholars ſhall find by woful Experience, they can act
the <hi>Puritans</hi> better than they have done the <hi>Jeſuits:</hi> That their
Foundation is <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> that the <hi>Arminians</hi> and Projectors affect
Mutation.</p>
                  <p>Having thus laid the Foundation for propagating their Religion,
the Jeſuits next Care was for the State; and in the firſt place they
conſider the King's Honour and Neceſſities, and ſhew how the
King may free himſelf of his Word, as <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>11th</hi> did, and
for greater Splendor and Luſtre; how he may raiſe a great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
and not be beholden to his Subjects, which was by way of
Exciſe, which muſt be by a mercenary Army of Horſe and
Foot. For the Horſe they had made ſure they ſhould be Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and <hi>Germans,</hi> who would eat up the King's Revenue, and ſpoil
the Countries whereſoever they came tho they ſhould be paid;
What Havock then will they make there when they get no Pay, or
are not duly paid? they will do more Miſchief than we hope the
Army will do.</p>
                  <p>This mercenary Army of 2000 Horſe and 20000 Foot was to be
taken into pay before the <hi>Exciſe</hi> be ſettled. In forming the <hi>Exciſe,</hi>
the Country is moſt likely to riſe; if the Mercenary Army ſubju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the Country, the Soldiers are to be paid out of the Confiſcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
they hope inſtantly to diſſolve Trade, and hinder the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Ships, by deviſing probable Deſigns, and putting the State
upon Expeditions, as that of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and in taking away the Merchants
Ships, ſo that they may not eaſily catch, and light upon the <hi>Weſt-India</hi>
Fleet.</p>
                  <p>A Jeſuit and nine Prieſts were taken with this, and many other
Papers, which were delivered to Sir <hi>John Cook,</hi> Secretary of State;
the Jeſuit was condemn'd, but reprieved by the King, becauſe Sir
<hi>John Cook</hi> ſaid, <hi>The King delighted not in Blood:</hi> and afterward the
nine Prieſts were releaſed by ſpecial Warrant from the King; and
the King in his Reaſons for diſſolving the Parliament, makes the
Houſe of Commons Enquiry into this Buſineſs to be an exorbitant
Encroachment and Uſurpation, ſuch as was never before attempted
by that Houſe. By this you may ſee the Religious care this pious
Prince had for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and how much he regarded
the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> or minded the Support of the poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
in <hi>France,</hi> or the Re-eſtabliſhment of his Brother-in-law
in the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus ſtood things when the Parliament met the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi>
when the King (as Men in a deep Lethargy, no ways ſenſible of
their Pain, or the dangerous State they are in) not conſidering
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60932:104"/>
the dangerous State he was in both abroad and at home; Abroad, in
that he had made War upon the King of <hi>Spain</hi> without any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of War, and that againſt his Father's Advice, and of his
Council; and upon the King of <hi>France,</hi> wherein himſelf and his
Favourite <hi>Buckingham,</hi> were the Aggreſſors; at Home by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of Invaſions upon the Fortunes and Liberties of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
never before done by any King of <hi>England,</hi> in the ſhort In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval
of theſe two Parliaments, (ſcarce being 9 Months) upon
the Opening of the Parliament, far unlike his Father in the laſt
Parliament of his Reign, when his Caſe was not near ſo dangerous
as this King's (tho their Neceſſities were equal, to get Money by
Parliaments, when they could get it no other Way) begins his
Speech.</p>

was a Failure of Juſtice, ſure it had been more to the King's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
not to have mention'd this to the Parliament, than that
what he had done was by their Advice.</p>
                  <p>Did this Parliament, or any other, ever adviſe him to put the

Pleaſure, denying them the Benefit of their <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>'s, the

Parliament, to raiſe Monies by Impoſition in the nature of Exciſe,
to be levied throughout the Nation, for the Maintenance of the
Church and State? And at the ſame time to order my Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
to pay 30000 <hi>l.</hi> to <hi>Philip Burlemac,</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant in
<hi>London,</hi> to be by him returned into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> by Bill of
Exchange, to Sir <hi>William Balfour</hi> and <hi>John Dalbier,</hi> for the raiſing
of 1000 Horſe, with Arms both for Horſe and Foot, for the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the Church and Commonwealth of <hi>England?</hi> And alſo
to call a Council for levying <hi>Ship-Money,</hi> now he had by his own
Will taken the Cuſtoms without any Grant of Parliament, for the
Maintenance of the Church and State?</p>
                  <p>I therefore judging a Parliament to be the antient, ſpeediest, and
best way, in this time of <hi>Common Danger,</hi> to give ſuch Supply as to
ſecure our ſelves, and ſave our Friends from imminent Ruin, have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
you together. Every Man must do according to his Conſcience;
wherefore if you (as God forbid) ſhould not do your Duties, in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
what the State at this time needs, I must, in Diſcharge of my
Conſcience, uſe thoſe other means which God has put into my hands, to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60932:105"/>
ſave that which the Follies of particular Men may otherwiſe hazard to
loſe.</p>
                  <p>It's certain a Parliament is the beſt way, in time of <hi>Common
Danger,</hi> to give Supplies, and ſecure the Nation from imminent
Ruin, the Nation being moſt concerned in it; yet what Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Advice did the King take the laſt nine Months? If the
Nation and the King's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Friends be in ſuch imminent Ruin, the
King ſhould have declared who thoſe Friends were, and who they
were which threatned this Ruin. When his Father died he was
at Peace with all the World, and it was his own Wilfulneſs, that
without any other Counſel but that of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> he made War
upon <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain:</hi> and let any Man read the Paſſages of the
ſhort time of his Reign, and judg if the imminent Ruin of the
Nation were not from himſelf within, as well as without; and if
the granting him further Supplies, would not more endanger the
Nation, in carrying on his Deſigns in both.</p>
                  <p>Here note, Tho the King had made no Conſcience of what he
had done, yet he now tells the Parliament, If they ſhall not do
their Duties in contributing what the State at this time needs, he
muſt, in Diſcharge of his Conſcience, uſe thoſe other Means which
God hath put into his hands, to ſave that which the Follies of
particular Men may other ways hazard to loſe. The King ſhould
have explained what other ways God put into his hands to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
his Subjects, than by Juſtice, Judgment, and Righteouſneſs;
for all other ways are unjuſt and wicked. And how any Man,
how great ſoever, can plead Conſcience to perpetrate Injuſtice
and Wickedneſs, muſt be unfolded by <hi>Laud, Neal, Sibthorp, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waring,
Mountague, Wren, Heylin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King proceeds, and ſays,</hi> Take not this for a Threatning, (for I
ſcorn to threaten any but my Equals) but an Admonition from him that
both out of Nature and Duty has most Care of your Preſervations and
Proſperities.</p>
                  <p>This is <hi>Humano capiti cervicem jungere equinam.</hi> What a Monſter
does the King here make a Parliament? the Head ſo incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſively
big, and the Body ſo ſcornful and little? But if it ill
becomes any Man to glory in his own Actions, it worſe becomes
him to glory in that which he himſelf had not done. So that
admit the King had been ſo ſuperlatively great, as to ſcorn all the
World beſides, yet it would better have become any other to have
ſaid it, than the King. A Parliament is a Political Body, whereof
the King is the Head; and the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and
the Repreſentatives of the Commons, the Body; and, What is the
Head without the Body? Are not all the Members of every Body
of Uſe for the Head? And does not the Head ſtand in need of
every Member of the Body? But if the Head be overgrown, and
too big, and the Body too ſcornful and lean, is not this not only
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60932:105"/>
monſtrous, but a Symptom of the Imperfection of the whole, and
that it is in a declining and dangerous State?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet the King tells them, The End of calling this Parliament was
for Supply.</hi> And did ever King, or other Man, before him, tell thoſe
from whom he expected Supply, or any other Benefit, that he ſcorn'd
them? and if they do not their Duties, he would uſe other Means which
God had put in his hands, without telling what thoſe other Means
were? and call them Fools, and particular Men, if they do not their
Duties, to ſave what they may otherwiſe hazard to loſe? whereas here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ever thank'd the Parliament upon a Bill
for Aids.</p>
                  <p>But after all this, the Parliament muſt not take it for a Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but an Admonition. An Admonition may be taken in a
double Senſe; either to inſtruct another in his Duty, or to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
or threaten another, if he continues obſtinate in ſome Fault
or Crime committed by that other: But this Admonition of the
King's in the Parliament, muſt not be taken for a Threatning of
them, therefore it muſt be for their Inſtruction, ignorant of their
Duties.</p>
                  <p>A Parliament was called by the <hi>Saxons Wittenage-Mote,</hi> or the
<hi>Conventus Sapientum,</hi> the Meeting of Wiſe Men, who met together
to deliberate of the arduous and urgent Buſineſſes of the Kingdom,
and concerning the State and Defence of the Kingdom and Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and is called the <hi>Common Council</hi> of the Kingdom, and
the <hi>General Council</hi> of the Kingdom, and the <hi>Council</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
See <hi>4th Inſtitute</hi> 2. And tho the Writ of Summons of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
be <hi>Ad Tractandum &amp; Deliberandum de certis arduis Regni
negotiis, &amp; pro ſtatu &amp; defenſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e Regni &amp; Eccleſiae Angliae concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentibus;</hi>
yet the Parliaments of <hi>England,</hi> unlike the Convention
of the State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> are not tied up to thoſe things only which
the King propounds, but are free to treat and deliberate of all
things which other ways concern the Kingdom and Church of
<hi>England.</hi> So that the great End of the Meeting of Parliaments, is
to adviſe the King: And all our <hi>Saxon, Norman,</hi> and <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kings,
had ever Parliaments in ſo high an Eſteem, that we do not read
any where, before theſe two Kings of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Race came to
reign over us, that ever any King and Parliament parted in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt;
whereas ſince King <hi>James</hi> came to be King, five or ſix
parted in Diſguſt; and God knows what would have become of
the other, if King <hi>James</hi> had not died before the Parliament met
again.</p>
                  <p>Did ever any King of <hi>England</hi> before, tho he ſcorn'd to threaten
the Parliament, yet admoniſh them of their Duties, or otherwiſe
he would uſe thoſe other means than by Parliament, which God
had put into his hands? But <hi>Quorſum haec?</hi> or where will the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of this young King ſtop? However, you may ſee by this
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60932:106"/>
Speech of the King's, that thoſe who govern'd him were as little
Politicians as Orators.</p>
                  <p>But good Laws often ariſe from corrupt Times and bad Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
for <hi>Magna Charta</hi> did ariſe from the Uſurpations of K. <hi>John,</hi>
and <hi>Henry</hi> III. above the Laws and Liberties of this Nation; ſo
did the <hi>Petition of Right</hi> the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of this Age, from the
Uſurpations of this King, ſince the Diſſolution of the laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Meeting of this, little more than nine Months.</p>
                  <p>And as the old <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was no new Law, but a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the old, reſtored by <hi>Henry</hi> II. King <hi>John</hi>'s Father, called the
<hi>Avitae Leges;</hi> ſo neither was the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> which enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
the Breaches the King had made of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
other Laws, before it prays Relief againſt them.</p>
                  <p>But theſe <hi>Magna Charta</hi>'s were obtained after different manners,
the old by cruel Wars: The Doctrines of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> and
ſubmitting to the <hi>Abſolute Will and Pleaſure</hi> of the King, were
Strangers to thoſe Days; and the Biſhops were ſo far from thoſe
Doctrines, that they were the chief Promoters of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi>
and ſtigmatized the Infringers of it, the King himſelf not excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
with a dreadful <hi>Anathema.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas neither <hi>Rome</hi> nor <hi>Athens</hi> could ever glory in ſuch an
Aſſembly as the Commons of this Parliament were, for their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Learning; nor any Age produce ſuch a number of Men of
the like Integrity to their Country, and humble Obedience to
their Prince. Notwithſtanding the former Abuſes of this Reign,
they proceeded with no Cenſures and Puniſhment of the King's
evil Miniſters (except Dr. <hi>Manwaring)</hi> but only to repreſent to
the King the Grievances of the Nation; and did not impeach the
Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> as they did in the laſt Parliament, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
upon it, but only remonſtrated to the King the Evils which
the exorbitant Greatneſs of the Duke brought upon the King and
Nation; and how unſafe it would be to the Nation, to grant Aids
to the King which were miſemployed for the exalting the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of the Duke. However, before they entred upon Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
they voted the King five entire Subſidies; which was the
greateſt Tax that ever was before given to any King of <hi>England</hi> at
once, and to be paid in the ſhorteſt time. Now let's ſee, tho but
in Epitome, how theſe things were changed, and what Returns
the King made the Parliament and Nation.</p>
                  <p>The Unanimity of the Commons in the Gift, was not leſs than
the Gift was great, being <hi>nemine contradicente;</hi> which ſo pleaſed
the King, that he ſent them word by Secretary Sir <hi>John Cooke,</hi>
that he would deny them nothing of their Liberties which any of
his Predeceſſors had granted them.</p>
                  <p>Then the Commons fell upon Grievances, and voted the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
of any Free-man by Warrant from the King or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60932:106"/>
without a Cauſe alledged, to be a Grievance; and that the
raiſing Monies by Loan, and impoſing an Oath upon the Subject
to diſcover the Value of his Eſtate, the Billeting of Soldiers, and
exerciſing Martial Law in time of Peace, were Grievances.</p>
                  <p>Then ſeveral Debates aroſe in the Houſe, how the Subjects
ſhould be ſecured againſt theſe in time to come. And upon the
Motion of Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> the Houſe agreed to ſue to the King
by Petition, the moſt antient and humble Addreſs in Parliament,
that his Majeſty would give his People Aſſurance of their Rights
by Aſſent in Parliament, as he uſes to paſs other Acts. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Houſe ordered Sir <hi>Edward</hi> to draw a Petition accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
                  <p>The Houſe agreed to the Petition; and ordered Sir <hi>Edw. Coke,</hi>
Sir <hi>Dudley Diggs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Littleton</hi> to carry it up to
the Lords. The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and his Creatures were zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to ſtop the Petition in the Houſe of Lords: but he was much
fall'n from his Luſtre, ſince his diſhonourable Expedition to the
Iſle of <hi>Rhee</hi> laſt Summer, and his Expedition to <hi>Cales.</hi> So as his
Sway in the Houſe of Peers was much abated: Beſides, the Biſhops
were not at this time all of a piece; for Arch-biſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> urged
his own Caſe, how he was baniſhed from his Houſes at <hi>Croydon</hi> and
<hi>Lambeth,</hi> while the Duke was proſecuting his Voyage to the Iſle
of <hi>Rhee,</hi> and confined to a mooriſh Manſion-place at <hi>Ford,</hi> to kill
him, and debarred from the Management of his Juriſdiction, and
no Cauſe given for it. And Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> gave moſt learned and
elegant Arguments for the Petition, which you may read at large
in the ſecond Part of the Hiſtory of his Life, <hi>fol.</hi> 77, 78, 79. But
this ſtuck cloſe to him, that neither the King nor <hi>Laud</hi> ever after
forgot it; which you may read <hi>fol. 96. tit.</hi> 93.</p>
                  <p>The Lords would not proceed to any determinate Vote, before
they had heard the King's Counſel againſt the Petition, and the
Commons Defence of it; wherein no leſs time was ſpent than ſix
Weeks. The Managers for the Petition, were Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> Sir <hi>Dudley Diggs,</hi> Sergeant <hi>Glanvile,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Martin,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Maſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the Commons fortified the Petition of
Right with ſix other Acts of Parliament, explanatory of <hi>Magna
Charta, viz.</hi> The Statute made in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> I. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>Statutum de Tallagio non concedendo;</hi> the Statute
of 25 <hi>Edward</hi> III. where it is declared, <hi>That from thenceforth no
Perſon ſhall be compelled to make any Loans to the King against his
Will, becauſe ſuch Loans were againſt Reaſon, and the Fanchiſe of the
Land.</hi> The third was the Statute of 28 <hi>Edward</hi> III. <hi>That no Man,
of what Eſtate or Condition ſoever, ſhould be put out of his Lands or
Tenements, nor Taken, nor Impriſoned, nor Diſherited, nor put to
Death, without being brought to Anſwer by due Proceſs of Law.</hi> The
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60932:107"/>
fourth Statute, the 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> III. 9. and the ſixth, 9 <hi>Hen.</hi> III. 29.
againſt exerciſing Martial Law in times of Peace. Theſe Statutes
were ſo well managed by the Commons in Defence of the Petition,
that Sir <hi>Robert Heath,</hi> who was Attorney-General, and the reſt
of the King's Counſel pleading, tho eagerly, yet impertinently,
had nothing to ſay materially againſt them, but ſubmitted to the
Judgment of the Peers.</p>
                  <p>However, the Lords, before they would put the Vote, entred
into a Committee of the whole Houſe, when my Lord <hi>Say</hi> moved,
That thoſe Lords who ſtood for the Liberties of the Nation, might
make their Proteſtation, and that to be upon Record; and that
the other oppoſite Party ſhould, with the Subſcriptions of their
Names, enter their Reaſons to remain upon Record, that ſo Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
might not be to ſeek who they were that ſo ignobly betrayed
the Freedom of our Nation: and this done, they ſhould proceed
to Vote. This ſtruck ſuch a Daunt upon the other Party, that
not one of them oppoſed it.</p>
                  <p>The Lords agreed to the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> but with this <hi>Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or <hi>Saving; We preſent this our humble Petition to your Majeſty,
with the Care not only of preſerving our Liberties, but with due Regard
to leave entire that Soveraign Power wherewith your Majeſty is truſted,
for the Protection, Safety, and Happineſs of the People.</hi> But the
Lords did not make any determinate Vote in it, but ſent it to the
Commons to adviſe upon. The Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> was a great Stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
for this Addition, to qualify what he had ſaid before in the
Defence of the Petition; which did him no good, the other ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>alta mente.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When this</hi> Addition, <hi>or</hi> Saving, <hi>came down to the Commons,
Mr.</hi> Noy <hi>ſaid,</hi> To add a <hi>Saving</hi> is not ſafe; doubtful Words may beget
ill Conſtruction; and the Words are not only doubtful, and Words un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to us, but never uſed in any Act or Petition before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Sir</hi> Edward Coke <hi>ſaid,</hi> This is the <hi>Multum in parvo,</hi> this is
propounded to the Concluſion of our Petition: it is a Matter of great
weight; and to ſpeak plain, it will overthrow all our Petition: it
trenches on all the parts of it: it flies at <hi>Loans,</hi> at the <hi>Oath,</hi> at
<hi>Impriſonment,</hi> and <hi>Billeting of Soldiers:</hi> this turns all about again.
Look into all Petitions of former times, they never petitioned, wherein
there was a <hi>Saving</hi> of the King's Soveraignty. I know Prerogative is
part of the Law, but Soveraign Power is no Parliamentary Word: In
my Opinion, it weakens <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and all our Statutes, for they
are abſolute without any <hi>Saving Power;</hi> and ſhould we now add it,
we ſhall weaken the Foundation of the Law, and then the Building
must needs fall. Take we heed what we yield unto; <hi>Magna Charta</hi>
is ſuch a Fellow, that he will have no Soveraign: I wonder this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
was not in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or in the Confirmations of it. If
we grant this, by Implication we give a Soveraign Power above all
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60932:107"/>
theſe Laws. Power in Law, is taken for a Power with Force: The
Sheriff ſhall take the Power of the County: what is meant here, only
God knows. It is repugnant to our Petition, grounded on Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
Our Predeceſſors could never endure a <hi>Salvo jure ſuo,</hi> no
more than the Kings of old could endure for the Church, <hi>Salvo honore
Dei &amp; Eccleſiae.</hi> We must not admit this; and to qualify it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.
Let us hold our Privileges according to the Law: that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
which is above this, is not fit for the King or People to have it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
further. I had rather, for my part, have the Prerogative acted,
and I my ſelf lie under it, than have it diſputed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Thomas Wentworth <hi>ſaid,</hi> If we admit of this <hi>Addition,</hi> we
leave the Subject worſe than we found him; and we ſhall have little
Thanks for our Labour when we come home. Let us leave all Power to
his Majeſty to puniſh Malefactors; but theſe Laws are not acquainted
with Soveraign Power. We deſire no new thing; nor do we offer to
trench upon his Majeſty's Prerogative. We may not recede from our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
neither in part or whole.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Selden <hi>ſaid,</hi> Let us not go haſtily to the Queſtion: if there be
any Objections, let any propound them, and let others anſwer them as
they think good: If it <hi>(the Saving)</hi> hath no Reference to our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
what does it here? I am ſure others will ſay it hath Reference,
and ſo muſt we: how far it does exceed all Examples of former times,
no Man can ſhew the like. <hi>Then he ſhews the manifold Statutes,
beſides</hi> Magna Charta, <hi>wherein is no ſuch</hi> Saving. <hi>And whereas
Mr.</hi> Speaker <hi>ſaid,</hi> The King was our Heart, and ever ſhall be; <hi>but
then Mr.</hi> Selden <hi>ſaid,</hi> We ſpake of the King's Prerogative, and we are
bound to ſay ſo: but when we ſpeak of our Rights, we are not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned,
Saving but by the King's Soveraign Power. Say, my Lands
(without any Title) be ſeized into the King's hand, and I bring a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of Right, and I go to the King, and ſay, I do by no means ſeek
your Majeſty's Title; and after that I bring a Petition or <hi>Monſtrance
de droit,</hi> ſetting forth my own Right and Title, and withal ſet down
a <hi>Saving</hi> that I leave entire his Majeſty's Right; it would be improper.
<hi>Then he cites many Statutes wherein there are</hi> Savings, <hi>but no
ways pertinent to this, which you may read at large in</hi> Ruſhworth'<hi>s</hi>
Collections <hi>and</hi> Franklin'<hi>s</hi> Annals. <hi>And, in truth, it troubles me, I
am forced to curtail this, not only in Mr.</hi> Selden, <hi>but other Noble
Perſons, by reaſon the Treatiſe would ſwell to a greater Bulk than
I deſigned it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lords afterwards had a Conference with the Commons to
fortify their <hi>Addition,</hi> managed by my Lord Keeper, which was
anſwered by Mr. <hi>Maſon:</hi> And after that, the Commons deſired ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Conference with the Lords, and ordered Serjeant <hi>Glanvile</hi> to
argue the legal part of the Petition, and Sir <hi>Henry Martin</hi> the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
part of it; which they did ſo well, that at a Conference,
<hi>May</hi> 26. 1628, between both Houſes, the Lord Keeper from the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60932:108"/>
Lords told the Commons, the Lords agreed with them <hi>in omnibus</hi>
of their Petition, only in the Alteration of two Words, <hi>viz. [Means]</hi>
for <hi>Pretext,</hi> and for the Word <hi>[unlawful] (not warrantable by the
Laws and Statutes of the Realm).</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Houſes thus happily accorded, the Petition, with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Amendments, were read two ſeveral times in the Houſe of
Commons, and then upon the Queſtion, voted to be engroſſed,
and read a third time, and the Houſe to ſit in the Afternoon till
it was engroſſed and read, and ordered to be preſented to the
King; in which there was not one Negative: And the Bill for the
Subſidies was read a ſecond time, and committed; and upon
<hi>Wedneſday</hi> the <hi>28th,</hi> the Lords and Commons had a Conference
about the Manner of Delivery of the Petition; and Sir <hi>Edward
Coke</hi> reported, that their Lordſhips were agreed, That no Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Preface be uſed to the King, but that the Petition be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to his Majeſty by the Command of the Lords and Commons;
and that his Majeſty by be deſired, to the Content of his People, he
would give his Gracious Anſwer in full Parliament.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe Tranſactions the King was very uneaſy; fain he
would have the Money, yet was unwilling to anſwer the Petition.
The Houſe was aware of this, and therefore agreed the Petition
before they would paſs the Money-Bill. Upon the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi>
the King, by Secretary <hi>Cook,</hi> acquainted them of the Neceſſity of
Supply, and expected ſome Fruit of what was ſo happily begun;
but finding a Stop beyond all Expectation of ſo good a Beginning,
the Secretary was therefore commanded to tell them, That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any further or unneceſſary Delay, they proceed in this Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<hi>and bid them therefore take heed, that they force him not to
make an unpleaſing end of that which was ſo well begun.</hi> And two
Days after the Secretary quickned the Buſineſs of this Supply
again.</p>
                  <p>Upon the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>May</hi> the King ſent a Meſſage by Secretary <hi>Cook,</hi>
That as he would rank himſelf amongſt the beſt of Kings, wherein
he has no Intention to invade or impeach our lawful Liberties; ſo
he would have them to match themſelves with the beſt of Subjects,
not by encroaching upon that Soveraignty or Prerogative which
God had put into his hands for their Good: and that this Seſſions
of Parliament muſt continue no longer than <hi>Tueſday</hi> come Seven-night
at the fartheſt: and that his Royal Intention is, to have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Seſſion at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> next, for the perfecting ſuch things
as cannot now be done. Now let's ſee how unwillingly the King
was brought to paſs the Petition.</p>
                  <p>Upon the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> Secretary <hi>Cook</hi> preſſed the Houſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the King's Word, and that the King promiſed to govern
them by the Laws, and that they ſhall enjoy as much Freedom as
ever, and that this might be debated in the Houſe: but Sir <hi>John
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60932:108"/>
Elliot</hi> anſwered, that the Proceedings in a Committee is more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and advantagious to the King and Houſe, with whom
the Houſe agreed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Debate of this Committee, ſome were for the Bill to
reſt, but Sir</hi> Edward Coke'<hi>s Reaſons prevailed to the contrary:</hi>
Was it ever known, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that <hi>General Words</hi> were a ſufficient
Satisfaction to <hi>particular Grievances?</hi> Was ever a Verbal Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the King, <hi>Verbum Regni?</hi> When Grievances be, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is to redreſs them: Did ever Parliament rely on Meſſages?
They put up Petitions of their Grievances, and the King anſwered them:
The King's Anſwer is very gracious, but what is the Law of the
Realm, that's the Queſtion. I put no Diffidence in his Majeſty, the
King muſt ſpeak by Record, and in Particulars, not in General: Did
you ever know the King's Meſſage to a Bill of Subſidies? all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Kings will ſay, <hi>You muſt truſt me as well as you did my
Predeceſſors, and truſt my Meſſages;</hi> but Meſſages never came into
a Parliament: Let us put up a Petition of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ight, not that I diſtruſt
the King, but that I cannot take his Truſt but in a Parliamentary
way.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Commons deſired a Conference with the Lords,
which was managed by Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> who ſaid,</p>
                  <p>My Lords, it is evident what neceſſity there is, both in reſpect of
your ſelves and your Poſterity to have good Succeſs in this Buſineſs; we
have acquainted your Lordſhips with the Reaſons and Arguments, and
after we have had ſome Conference we have received from your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
Propoſitions, and it behoves us to give your Lordſhips ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
why you have not heard from us before now; for in the mean time,
as we were conſulting this weighty Buſineſs, we have received divers
Meſſages from our great Soveraign the King, and they conſiſted of five
Parts.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That his Majeſty would maintain all his Subjects in their juſt
Freedom, both of their Perſons and Eſtates.</item>
                     <item>2. That he will govern according to his Laws and Statutes.</item>
                     <item>3. That we ſhall find much Confidence in his Royal Word: <hi>I pray
obſerve that.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. That we ſhall enjoy all our Rights and Liberties, with as much
freedom as ever Subjects have done in former times.</item>
                     <item>5. That whether we think fit, either by Bill or otherways, to go on
in this great Buſineſs, his Majeſty would be pleaſed to give way t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Theſe gracious Meſſages did ſo work upon our Affections, that we
have taken it into deep Conſideration. My Lords, what we had theſe
Meſſages (I deal plainly, for ſo I am commanded by the Houſe of
Commons) we did conſider what way would be our moſt ſecure way,
nay yours: We did think it the ſafeſt way to go on in a Parliamentary
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60932:109"/>
Courſe; for we have a Maxim in the Houſe of Commons, and written
in the Wall of our Houſe, <hi>That old Ways are the ſafeſt and ſureſt
Ways:</hi> And at laſt we did fail upon that, which we think (if your
Lordſhips did conſent with us) the moſt antient of all, and that is,
my Lords, the <hi>Via fauſta,</hi> both to his Majeſty, to your Lordſhips, and
to our ſelves: For, my Lords, this is the greateſt Bond that any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
can have in open Parliament, <hi>Verbum Regis:</hi> That is a high
Point of Honour, but this muſt be done by the Lords and Commons, and
aſſented to by the King in Parliament: This is the greateſt Obligation
of all, and this is for the King's Honour, and our Safety. Therefore,
my Lords, we have drawn the Form of a Petition, deſiring your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
to concur with us therein, for we do come with an unanimous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of all the Commons, and there is great reaſon your Lordſhips ſhould
do ſo, for your Lordſhips be involved in the ſame Danger: <hi>and then
the Petition was read.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> the King wrote a Letter to the Houſe
of Lords, wherein he ſaid, That as he had given leave to free De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
upon the higheſt Points of his <hi>Prerogative Royal,</hi> which in
the times of his Predeceſſors were ever reſtrained, as Matters they
would not have diſcuſſed, yet he finds it inſiſted upon, that in no
Cauſe whatſoever he and his Council could commit without
Cauſe ſhewed, which, if granted, would diſſolve the Frame of
the Monarchy: That as he had made fair Propoſitions to the
Commons, which might eaſily preſerve the Liberty of the Subject;
ſo he thought good to let their Lordſhips know, that without
the overthrow of the Soveraignty he could not ſuffer his Power
to be impeached; yet that he will extend it beyond the juſt Rule
of Moderation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he thought good to ſignify, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſhorten the long Debates upon this great Queſtion, the
Seaſon of the Year being ſo far advanced, and his great Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of State not lending many more days for the continuance of
the Seſſion.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day the Lords communicated the Letter to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
upon which Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> ſaid, it was a Letter of
Grace, but the People will only like that which is done in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
way, and the Debate upon it would take up much
time; neither was it directed to the Commons, and the <hi>Petition of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ight</hi> would clear all Miſtakes; for ſome give out as if the Houſe

                     </gap> to pinch the King's Prerogative, and ſo the Letter was laid
aſide. Theſe were while the Petition was in debate, and before
it was ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed to by both Houſes; but after it was agreed upon, the
ſecond of <hi>June</hi> the King came into the Houſe of Lords, and
having ſent for the Commons, ſaid,</p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:60932:109"/>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Gentlemen,<lb/>
I</hi> Am come hither to perform my Duty, I think no Man can think it
long, ſince I have not taken ſo many days in anſwering your Petition,
as you have ſpent Weeks in framing it. I am come hither to ſhew you,
that as well in formal Things, as in eſſential, I deſire to give you as
much Content as in me lies.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then the Lord Keeper ſaid;</hi>
                     <q>MY Lords, and ye the Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes of the
Houſe of Commons, the King hath commanded me to ſay unto
you, That he takes it in good part, that in Conſideration of ſettling your
own Liberties, ye have generally profeſſed in both Houſes that ye have
no intention to leſſen or diminiſh his Majeſty's Prerogative; wherein as
ye have cleared your Intentions, ſo now his Majeſty comes to clear his,
and to ſubſcribe a firm League with his People, which is ever likely to
be moſt conſtant and perpetual when the Conditions are moſt equal, and
known to be ſo: Theſe cannot be in a more happy State, than when your
Liberties ſhall be an Ornament and Strength of his Majeſty's Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and his Prerogative a Defence of your Liberties, in which his
Majeſty doubts not, but that both he and you ſhall take a mutual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
hereafter; and for his part, he is reſolved to give an Example in
uſing his Power for the Preſervation of your Liberties, that hereafter
you ſhall have no cauſe to complain; and that they here read their own
Petition, and his Majeſty's gracious Anſwer.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then the Petition was read, to which the King anſwered,</hi> The
King willeth that Right be done according to the Laws and Cuſtoms of
the Realm; and that the Statutes be put in due Execution, that his
Subjects may have no cauſe to complain of any Wrong or Oppreſſions,
contrary to their juſt Rights and Liberties, to the Preſervation of which
he holds himſelf in Conſcience as well obliged, as of his Prerogative.</p>
                  <p>This Anſwer no ways ſatisfied the Commons: whereupon Sir <hi>John
Elliot</hi> made a pathetick and lively Repreſentation of the Grievances
of the Nation within, and of the Danger and Weakneſs of it by
the Miſmanagement and Abuſe of the King's Miniſters; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wiſhed that it might ſo ſtand with the Wiſdom and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Houſe, that theſe Dangers and Grievances may be
drawn into the Body of a Remonſtrance, and therein humbly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
with a Prayer to his Majeſty, for the Safety of himſelf, and
for the Safety of the Kingdom, and for the Safety of Religion,
that he would be pleaſed to give the Houſe time to make perfect
Inquiſitions thereof; or to take it into his own Wiſdom, and there
give them ſuch timely Reformation, as the neceſſity of the Cauſe
and his Juſtice does import. Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> ſeconded Sir <hi>John
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60932:110"/>
Elliot</hi>'s Motion, and propounded that a humble Remonſtrance be
preſented to the King, touching the Dangers and Means of the
Safety of the King and Kingdom, which was agreed to by the
Houſe, and thereupon the Houſe turned themſelves into a grand
Committee, and the Committee for the Bill of Subſidies was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to expedite the ſaid Remonſtrance.</p>
                  <p>But this King rather than hear of what he had done, did not
care what he did, and therefore the Speaker brought a Meſſage
from the King, That his Majeſty having upon the Petition exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by both Houſes, given an Anſwer ſo full of Juſtice and
Grace, for which we and our Poſterity have juſt cauſe to bleſs his
Majeſty; it is now time to draw to a Concluſion of the Seſſion,
and therefore his Majeſty thinks fit to let them know, That he
does reſolve to abide by that Anſwer without further Change or
Alteration, and ſo he will Royally and Really perform unto them
what he had thereby promiſed: And further, That he reſolves
to end this Seſſion upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the <hi>11th</hi> of this Month; and
that this Houſe ſhould ſeriouſly attend thoſe Buſineſſes, which
may bring the Seſſion to a happy Concluſion, without entertaining
new Matters, and ſo to husband the time, that his Majeſty may
with more Comfort bring them ſpeedily together again; at which
time, if there be any further Grievances not contained or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the Petition, they may be more maturely conſidered
than the time will now permit. But this did not diſturb the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
but they proceeded in their Declaration againſt Dr <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waring,</hi>
and the ſame day preſented it to the Lords at a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
which was managed by Mr. <hi>Pym.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Commons impeached the Doctor upon theſe three Points
in his Sermons of Allegiance and Religion.</p>
                  <p>1. That he affirmed, that the King is not bound to keep and
obſerve the good Laws and Cuſtoms of this Realm, concerning
the Rights and Liberties of the Subjects; and that his Royal Will
and Command in impoſing Loans, Taxes, and other Aids upon his
People, without common Conſent in Parliament, does ſo far bind
the Conſciences of the Subjects of this Kingdom, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
refuſe the ſame without peril of Eternal Damnation.</p>
                  <p>2. That thoſe of his Majeſty's Subjects that refuſed the <hi>Loan,</hi>
did therein offend againſt the Law of God, and againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Supream Authority, and by ſo doing, became guilty of
Impiety, Diſloyalty, Rebellion and Diſobedience, and liable to
many other Taxes and Cenſures, which he in the ſeveral Parts of
his Book does moſt falſly and maliciouſly lay upon them.</p>
                  <p>3. That the Authority of Parliament is not neceſſary for the
raiſing of Aids and Subſidies; that the ſlow Proceedings of ſuch
Aſſemblies are not fit to ſupply the urgent Neceſſities of State,
but rather apt to produce ſundry Impediments to the juſt Deſign
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60932:110"/>
of Princes, and to give them occaſion of Diſpleaſure and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon the Commons demanded Judgment againſt the
Doctor, not accounting his Submiſſion with Tears and Grief a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for the Offence charged upon him; and the Lords gave
this Sentence.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That he ſhould be impriſoned during the Pleaſure of the Houſe.</item>
                     <item>2. That he ſhould be fined 1000 <hi>l.</hi> to the King.</item>
                     <item>3. That he ſhould make ſuch Submiſſion and Acknowledgment of his
Offences as ſhall be ſet down by a Committee in Writing, both at this
Bar and the Houſe of Commons.</item>
                     <item>4. That he ſhall be ſuſpended for the Term of three Years from the
Exerciſe of the Miniſtry, and in the mean time a ſufficient preaching
Miniſter ſhall be provided to ſerve the Cure out of his Livings; this
Suſpenſion and Proviſion to be done by the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction.</item>
                     <item>5. That he ſhall be diſabled hereafter to have any Eccleſiaſtical Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or Secular Office.</item>
                     <item>6. That he ſhall be diſabled hereafter ever to preach at Court.</item>
                     <item>7. That his Book is worthy to be burnt: and that for the better ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
of this, his Majeſty may be moved to grant a Proclamation to
call in the ſaid Books, that they may be burnt accordingly in <hi>London,</hi>
both the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, and for the inhibiting the printing thereof, upon
a great Penalty.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>This Cenſure immediately ſucceeding Sir <hi>John Elliot</hi>'s Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of Grievances, ſtartled <hi>Laud</hi> as much as Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
did the Duke of <hi>Buckingham;</hi> and the King, that he
might not hear of any more Buſineſs of this kind, upon the <hi>5th</hi>
of <hi>June,</hi> commanded the Speaker to let the Houſe know, that he
will certainly hold to the day fixed for ending the Seſſion, <hi>viz.</hi>
the <hi>11th,</hi> and therefore requires them, that they enter not into,
nor proceed in any new Buſineſs which may ſpend greater time,
or which may lay any Scandal or Aſperſion upon the State-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or the Miniſters thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This put the Houſe into a fearful Conſternation, whereupon
the Houſe declared,</hi> That every Member of the Houſe is free from
any undutiful Speech from the beginning of the Parliament to that day,
and ordered the Houſe to be turned into a Committee, to conſider what
was to be done for the Safety of the Kingdom, and that no Man go out
of the Houſe upon pain of being committed to the Tower. <hi>But before
the Speaker left the Chair, he deſired leave to go forth, which the
Houſe granted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> ſpake freely; <q>We have dealt with
that Duty and Moderation that never was the like. <hi>Rebus ſic
ſtantibus,</hi> after ſuch a Violation upon the Liberties of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60932:111"/>
let us take this to Heart. In 30 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. were they then
in any doubt to name Men that miſlead the King? They accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> the King's Son, the Lords <hi>Latimer</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>or miſadviſing the King, and they went to the <hi>Tower</hi> for
it; now when there is ſuch a downfal of the State, ſhall we hold
our Tongues? How ſhall we anſwer our Duty to God and Men?
7 <hi>Hen. 4. Parl. Rot. 31, 32. 11 Hen. 4. Numb.</hi> 13. there the
Council are complained of and removed from the King; they
mewed up the King, and diſſwaded him from the common
Good; and why are we turned from that way we were in?
Why may not we name thoſe that are the Cauſe of all our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils?
In the 4 <hi>H. 3. 21 E. 3. 13 R.</hi> 2. the Parliament mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
the King's Prerogative; and nothing grows to Abuſe but
this Houſe hath Power to treat thereof. What ſhall we do? Let
us palliate no longer, if we do, God will not proſper us; I
think the Duke of <hi>Bucks</hi> is the Cauſe of all our Miſeries, and
till the King be informed thereof, we ſhall neither go out with
Honour, nor ſit with Honour here; That Man is the Grievance
of Grievances; let us ſet down the Cauſes of all our Diſaſters,
and all will reflect on him. As for going to the Lords, that is
not <hi>via Regia,</hi> our Liberties are now impeached, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned;
it is not <hi>via Regia,</hi> the Lords are not participant with
our Liberties.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> adviſed, That a Declaration be drawn under four
Heads; Firſt, To expreſs the Houſe's dutiful Carriage to the
King. Secondly, To tender the Liberties violated. Thirdly, To
preſent what the Houſe was to have dealt in. Fourthly, That
that great Perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> the Duke, fearing to be queſtioned, did
interpoſe this Diſtraction: <q>All this time, ſaid he, we have caſt a
Mantle on what was done laſt Parliament. But now being driven
again to look on that Man, let us proceed with that which was
then well begun, and let the Charge be renewed that was laſt
Parliament againſt him, to which he made an Anſwer, but the
Particulars were ſufficient, that we may demand Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Anſwer only.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Concluſion, the Houſe agreed upon ſeveral Heads concerning
Innovations in Religion, the Safety of the King and Kingdom,
Miſgovernment, Misfortune of our late Deſigns, with the Cauſes
of them: and when the Queſtion was putting, that it ſhould be
inſtanced that the Duke was the principal and chief Cauſe of all
thoſe Evils, the Speaker came in and ſaid, that the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
for the preſent, that the Houſe adjourn till to Morrow,
and that all Committees ceaſe, which was done accordingly. And
upon the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> the King in Parliament paſſed the <hi>Petition
of Right,</hi> whereupon there was an univerſal Joy all over the City;
and the Commons returned to their own Houſe with unſpeakable
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60932:111"/>
Joy, and reſolved ſo to proceed, as might expreſs their Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and order the grand Committees for Religion, Trade, Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
and Courts of Juſtice to ſit no longer, but that the Houſe
proceed only in Conſideration of Grievances of moſt moment;
which was their <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> to the King, of the weak, diſtracted,
and dangerous State of the Kingdom: which was done in the moſt
pathetick and humble manner which could be expreſſed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the King in the <hi>Banqueting-Houſe,</hi> upon the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>June.</hi>
It's very long, and conſiſted of theſe ſix Branches.</p>
                  <p>1. The Danger of the Innovation and Alteration of Religion;
This occaſioned by, Firſt, The great Eſteem and Favour many of
the Profeſſors of the <hi>Romiſh Religion</hi> receive at Court. Secondly,
Their publick Reſort to Maſs at <hi>Denmark</hi>-Houſe, contrary to his
Majeſty's Anſwer to the Parliament's Petition at <hi>Oxford.</hi> Thirdly,
Letters to ſtay Proceedings againſt them. Laſtly, The daily
Growth of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Faction, favoured and protected by <hi>Neal</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and <hi>Laud</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> whilſt
the Orthodox Party are ſilenced or diſcountenanced.</p>
                  <p>2. Dangers of Innovation and Alteration in Government; occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by Billeting Soldiers, by Commiſſion of procuring <hi>1000
German</hi> Horſe and Riders for the Defence of the Kingdom, by a
ſtanding Commiſſion granted to the Duke to be General at Land
in time of Peace.</p>
                  <p>3. Diſaſters of our Deſigns; as, the Expedition to the Iſle of
<hi>Rhee,</hi> and that lately to <hi>Rochel,</hi> wherein the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
their Diſhonour, with the waſte of a Million of Treaſure.</p>
                  <p>4. The Want of Ammunition; occaſioned by the ſelling 36
laſts of Gun-powder at low Rates.</p>
                  <p>5. The Decay of Trade; by the Loſs of 300 Ships taken by the
<hi>Dunkirkers,</hi> and other Pirates, within the three laſt Years.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>The not guarding the narrow Seas; whereby his Majeſty has
almoſt loſt the Regality.</hi> Here note, That none of theſe, except Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leting
of Soldiers, which was yet continued, were contained in the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of Right.</p>
                  <p>Of all which Evil and Dangers, the principal Cauſe is the Duke
of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> his exceſſive Power, and Abuſe of that Power;
and therefore humbly ſubmit it to his Majeſty's Wiſdom, whether
it can be ſafe for himſelf and Kingdom, that ſo great Power ſhould
be truſted in the hands of any one Subject whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>It's obſervable, how croſs the King ſet himſelf againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in this <hi>Remonſtrance:</hi> for in the laſt Parliament, when the
Commons impeached the Duke, and the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> exhibited
Articles againſt him, the King ordered the Attorney-General to
exhibit an Information againſt the Duke in the Star-Chamber, for
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60932:112"/>
the great Miſdemeanours and Offences complained of againſt him
by the Commons and Earl; thereby to have ſtopt their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt the Duke in Parliament, as he would have taken the
Earl's Cauſe out of Parliament, and proceeded againſt him by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.
But the King hearing of this <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
againſt the Duke, the Day before the Commons preſented it,
<hi>viz.</hi> upon the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> cauſed the Attorney-General to take
the ſaid Information, and all the Proceedings to be taken off the
File, for that his Majeſty was fully ſatisfied of the Duke's Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in all thoſe things mentioned in the Information, as well by his
own certain Knowledg, as by the Proofs taken in the Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>This was the firſt Fruit the Parliament and Nation reaped by
the <hi>Petition of Right.</hi> Now let's ſee the next, and whether the
Commons deſerved ſuch a Cenſure as the King made upon them
at the Prorogation of the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>After the Commons had preſented a Remonſtrance of their other
Grievances to the King, they then took into Conſideration the
preparing a Bill for granting his Majeſty a Subſidy of Tunnage and
Poundage, as might uphold the King's Profit and Revenue in as
ample a manner as their juſt Care and Reſpect of Trade would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
But this being a Work of Time, and would require much
Time, and Conference with Merchants, and others; and being
often interrupted by Meſſages from the King, and the Shortneſs
of Time limited by the King for concluding this Seſſions; and
fearing the King might be miſinformed of this Particular, they
were forced, by the Duty which they owed to his Majeſty, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
<hi>That there ought not any Impoſition to be laid upon Goods of
Merchants exported or imported, without Common Conſent by Act of
Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For Manifeſtation whereof, they deſired his Majeſty to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
<q>That tho the Kings of this Realm had often Subſidies
granted them upon divers Occaſions, eſpecially for guarding the
Seas, and Safeguard of Merchants; yet the Subjects have been
ever careful to uſe ſuch Cautions and Limitations in theſe
Grants, that they did proceed not from Duty, but the free Gift
of the Subjects; and that heretofore they uſed to limit a time
for ſuch Grants, and for the moſt part but ſhort, as for a
Year or two; and at other times it has been granted upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of War, with <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that if the War ended in the mean
time, then the Grant ſhould ceaſe; and of courſe it has been
ſequeſtred into the hand of ſome Subject, to be employed for
Guarding of the Seas: very few of the King's Predeceſſors had
it for Life, until the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> VII. who was ſo far from
conceiving he had any Right thereunto, that altho he granted
Commiſſions for collecting certain Duties and Cuſtoms due by
Law, yet made none for receiving the Subſidies of Tunnage
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60932:112"/>
and Poundage, till it was granted in Parliament. Since his
time, all Kings and Queens have had ſuch Grants for Life, by
the free Love and Good-will of the Subjects: but whenſoever
the People have been grieved by laying on any other Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Charges upon their Goods and Merchandiſe without Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Law (which has been very ſeldom) yet upon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
in Parliament they have been relieved; ſaving in the time
of your Royal Father, who having through ill Counſel raiſed
the Rates and Charges upon Merchandiſe to that height at which
they now are, yet he was pleaſed ſo far to yield to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of his People, as to offer, That if the Value of ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
as he had ſet might be made good unto him, he would
bind himſelf and his Heirs, by Act of Parliament, never to lay
any more; which Offer the Commons did not yield to. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
your Loyal Commons in this Parliament, out of ſpecial
Zeal to your Majeſty's Service, and eſpecial Regard of your
preſſing Occaſions, have taken into their Conſideration, ſo to
frame a Grant of Subſidy of Tunnage and Poundage to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
that both you might have been better enabled for the
Defence of your Realm, and your Subjects, by being more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from all undue Charges, be more encouraged chearfully
to proceed in Trade; by Encreaſe whereof, your Majeſty's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
and likewiſe the Strength of the Kingdom, would be much
augmented.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>But being now not able to accompliſh this their Deſire, there
is no Courſe left to them, without manifeſt Breach of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to his Majeſty and Country, ſave only to make this Declaration,</hi>
That the receiving Tunnage and Poundage, and other Impoſitions,
not granted by Parliament, is a Breach of the Fundamental Liberties
of this Kingdom, and contrary to your Majeſty's Royal Anſwer to the
Petition of Right.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King, who had ſo unwillingly heard the Commons Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance
againſt the Duke before the Bill of Subſidies was paſſed
both Houſes, now it was paſt both Houſes, was reſolved to hear
no more of this: and therefore when this <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> concerning
the Tunnage and Poundage was engroſſed, and reading in the
Houſe, the King ſent for the Speaker, and the Houſe, to the
Houſe of Lords; where the King came ſo unexpectedly, that the
Lords had not put on their Robes, nor had the Commons given the
Speaker any Order or Direction to deliver the Bill of Subſidies,
neither was it brought down to the Commons again, as is uſual.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When the Commons came to the Lords Houſe, the King ſaid,</hi>
It may ſeem ſtrange that I come ſo ſuddenly to end this Seſſion, before
I give my Aſſent to the Bills. I will tell you the Cauſe, tho I must
avow, that I owe the Account of my Actions to God alone: It is known
to every one of you, that a while ago the Houſe of Commons gave me a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60932:113"/>
Remonſtrance, how acceptable every Man may judg; and for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of it, I will not call that in queſtion, for I am ſure no wiſe Man
can juſtify it.</p>
                  <p>Did ever any King of <hi>England,</hi> but this King's Father and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
treat a Parliament, or either Houſe, at this rate before? At
the opening of the Parliament he calls them <hi>Fools,</hi> if they would
not do as he would have them; and now he tells the Commons,
<hi>No wiſe Man can juſtify their Advice to him.</hi> I'm ſure, a wiſer Man
than this King, or his Father, ſays, <hi>He that wins Souls is wiſe;</hi>
and if you convert the Propoſition, <hi>He that provokes them, is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi>
Heretofore the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and, I believe, all prudent
and civiliz'd Princes, ever forbore to give any Petitioners harſh
Language; if their Petitions did not pleaſe, their uſual Anſwer
was, <hi>The King will conſider, or be adviſed upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One great End of the Meeting of Parliaments is, truly to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to the King the State of the Kingdom, (which is rarely done
by Flatterers and Favourites, whoſe Intereſt is contrary to that of
the Kingdom) and if any thing be done in Prejudice of the King
and Kingdom, that both may be redreſſed in Parliament. In the
Commons <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> to the King, they ſet forth the weak and
dangerous State of the Kingdom, equally dangerous to the King
and Kingdom, in ſix ſeveral Particulars: Does the King either an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
or deny any one of the Particulars otherwiſe, than <hi>that he is
ſure no wiſe Man can juſtify their Remonſtrance?</hi> But tells no Reaſon
for this, nor from whom he had this Aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>Was ever any King, or Man, ſo great, as to be above his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt?
or leſs, for being well adviſed in all his Actions? Nay, ought
not, not only every King, but other Men, be ſo much more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and adviſed in all their Actions, by how much greater they are?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King goes on, and ſays,</hi> Now ſince I am truly informed, that
a ſecond <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> is preparing for me, to take away the Profit of
<hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> one of the chief Maintenances of my Crown,
by alledging I have given away my Right thereto, by my Anſwer to your
Petition.</p>
                  <p>So that here the King hath true Information of that, but ſays
not how he was truly informed, which was not in being; for the
Remonſtrance was not paſſed the Commons when the King came
into the Houſe of Lords: ſo that it may more probably be, the
King is not truly informed of this Remonſtrance. I'm ſure he is
miſinformed, if the Remonſtrance, as it is printed in <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>
and <hi>Franklin,</hi> be true, <hi>that the Commons alledged that the King had
given away his Right to the Cuſtoms by his Anſwer to the Petition of
Right:</hi> For the Commons denied there, that either he, or any
of his Predeceſſors before him (which was long before the <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Right)</hi> had any Right to them, before they were granted
by the free Gift of the Subject: Tho the King would take the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60932:113"/>
Cuſtoms, to which he had no Right, yet would he not permit the
Commons to ſit till they could perfect a Bill to give him Duties up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> without which no King of <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him claimed any other Right.</p>
                  <p>But ſince the King ſays, in his Declaration for the Diſſolution
of the Parliament, that his Predeceſſors, time out of mind, have
had theſe Cuſtoms, but ſays not who told him ſo; it's fit to ſee
when and what Cuſtoms of <hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage</hi> were taken, and
for what end, and how they were taken. Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> in his
fourth <hi>Inſtitute</hi> of the High Court of Parliament, <hi>fol.</hi> 32. out of
Records makes thirteen Obſervations upon the Subſidy of <hi>Tunnage</hi>
and <hi>Poundage.</hi>

after <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. to King <hi>Charles</hi> 1. but theſe were of Wines only:
but theſe were always granted for the guarding the Seas, and of
the free good Will of the Subject.</p>
                  <p>So that the firſt Grant of theſe Duties of <hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage</hi>
for Life, began at <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. but that was but for that part of his
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60932:114"/>
Life for time to come, being granted in the third Year of his
Reign; and ſo were thoſe in the Reign of <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. which were
granted in the fourth Year of his Reign: and <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. would not
take them till they were granted by Parliament: and Sir <hi>Robert
Phillips,</hi> who was a Member of Parliament <hi>(Primo Jac.)</hi> ſays, in
his Speech in Parliament, (Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth</hi> mentions it, <hi>fol. 644.)</hi>
that by reaſon of the Sickneſs <hi>primo Jac.</hi> the Parliament was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued,
and then ſome were ſo bold, as to demand the Duties of
Tunnage and Poundage, for which they were queſtioned in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                  <p>But after the Duties of Tunnage and Poundage were given to
King <hi>James,</hi> and ſettled by a Book of Rates, King <hi>James</hi> (which
none of his Predeceſſors ever did before) impoſed higher Duties
upon ſeveral ſorts of Merchandiſe than were granted in Parliament,
by his own Will, and ſo continued them to his Death; and after
his Death, his Son, by his own Will, took not only thoſe Duties
granted by Parliament, but thoſe impoſed by his Father, neither
would he permit the Parliament to ſit to eſtabliſh a Book of Rates,
but prorogu'd or diſſolved them before they could accompliſh it.
And this was the <hi>Right</hi> he charges the Commons to endeavour to
take away, by his granting the <hi>Petition of Right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King goes on, and ſays,</hi> This <hi>(the Right to Tunnage and
Poundage, alledg'd to be given away by the Commons)</hi> is ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to me, that I am forced to end this Seſſion ſome few hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I meant, being unwilling to receive any more <hi>Remonſtrances,</hi> to
which I must give a harſh Anſwer. And ſince I ſee that the Houſe
of Commons begins already to make falſe Conſtructions of what I gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in your Petition, leſt it be worſe interpreted in the Country, I will
now make a Declaration concerning the true Intent thereof.</p>
                  <p>The King ſhould have declared whether he ſaw this falſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the Commons with his own Eyes, or the Eyes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
if with his own Eyes, Why does he not declare wherein
the Commons made this falſe Conſtruction of his Grant? Or if he
ſaw or heard of this falſe Conſtruction of the Commons from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the King ſhould have ſaid who told him ſo. Now let us ſee
if the contrary of what the King ſo injuriouſly charges the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
with, be not true.</p>
                  <p>The Commons ſay, No King of <hi>England</hi> ever claimed theſe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
but by the free Gifts of his Subjects; Does the King deny
this, or ſhew that ever any King of <hi>England</hi> claimed them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
or by any other Right? The Commons ſay, His Father rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
them to the height they then were, without Act of Parliament,
or free Gift of the People; Does the King deny this to be true?
And that the King continues to take theſe Cuſtoms, without any
Act of Parliament, or Gift of the People; Does the King deny this?
Do not the Commons tell the King, That out of their Zeal to his
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60932:114"/>
Service, and eſpecial Regard to his preſſing Occaſions, they had
under Conſideration ſo to frame a Grant of a Subſidy of Tunnage
and Poundage to his Majeſty, that he might have been the better
enabled for the Defence of his Realm and Subjects, by being ſecure
from all undue Charges, for the Security of Trade, the Profit of
the King, and Strength of the Kingdom? Does the King deny
this? With what Conſcience and Juſtice then does the King ſay,
the Commons made falſe Conſtructions of his Anſwer, alledging
he had given away his Right to the Cuſtoms, by his Anſwer to the
<hi>Petition of Right?</hi> When or where is any ſuch Allegation in any
part of the <hi>Remonſtrance?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Commons ſay, that ſince the King will not permit them to
finiſh their intended Subſidy, they have no Courſe left, without
manifold Breach of their Duty to his Majeſty and their Country,
ſave only to make this humble Declaration, <hi>That the receiving Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
and Poundage, and other Impoſitions, not granted by Parliament,
is a Breach of the Fundamental Liberties of this Kingdom, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to your Majeſty's Anſwer to the Petition of Right.</hi> Does the
King ſhew that it was not the Commons Duty to repreſent this
to him? or that the Commons alledged he had any Right to the
Duties which he had given away by his Anſwer to the <hi>Petition of
Right?</hi> Now let's ſee the King's Declaration of the true Intent of
his Anſwer to the <hi>Petition of Right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Profeſſion of both Houſes in the time of the <hi>Hammering (ſpoke
like a King)</hi> this Petition, was no ways to trench upon my <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
(no more it did)</hi> ſaying, They had neither Intention or Power
is hurt it; therefore it muſt needs be conceived, that I have granted
to new, but only to confirm the antient Liberties of my Subjects: Yet
to ſhew the Clearneſs of my Intentions, that I neither repent, nor mean
to recede from any thing I have promiſed you, I do here declare my ſelf,
That thoſe things which have been done, whereby many have had ſome
Cauſe to expect the Liberties of the Subject to be trenched upon, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was the first and true ground of the Petition, ſhall not hereafter
be drawn into Example for your Prejudice; and from time to time, on
the Word of a King, ye ſhall not have the like Cauſe to complain. But
as for <hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> it is a thing I cannot want, and was

                     </gap>ever intended by you to ask, nor meant by me, I am ſure, to grant:
<hi>Nor did the Commons ask any Grant of it, to them, or any
other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, I command you all that are here, to take notice of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat I have ſpoken at this time, to be the true Intent and Meaning of

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat I have granted you in your Petition, eſpecially you my Lords the
Judges, for to you only, under me, belongs the Interpretation of the

doubt, but theſe ſhall be <hi>durante bene placito</hi>-men all, who ſhall
not ſcruple to make the King's Will to be the Subjects Law; and
thoſe that will not, ſhall be none of this King's Judges.</p>
                  <p>I do not find that the King, before he prorogued them, gave
the Parliament any Thanks for the Bill of Subſidies, tho greater
than ever was given to any King, as his Predeceſſors ever did; or
if he did, it ill ſorted with the Speech he made before. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we proceed to take a View of this King's Actions in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of this Receſs of Parliament, let's a little conſider the preſent
State of the King and Kingdom; and herein, who it was the King
quarrelled with, and upon what Account, and for whoſe ſake: It
was with the Repreſentatives of the Kingdom, who had ſo obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiouſly
and unanimouſly gratified him above what any other
Houſe of Commons ever did to any King of <hi>England</hi> before. The
Crimes for which the King inveighed ſo againſt them were, for
repreſenting their Grievances, and the dangerous and feeble State
of himſelf and the Kingdom; and to repreſent to him the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Laws of the Kingdom, by taking the Cuſtoms, as he did;
yet declaring their Readineſs to relieve him therein, and to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
him to his Subjects. And for whom was it the King thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
but for a Favourite, who againſt the King's Father's Will,
and Advice of his Council, without a Declaration or Reaſon ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the next Day after the King's Father's Death (as the Biſhop of
<hi>Litchfield</hi> obſerves) excited him to make War againſt the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and after made the King to diſſolve the Parliament, to
ſave himſelf from being impeached in it? And ſo he did the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Parliament, and then engaged the King in a War againſt
<hi>France,</hi> wherein he himſelf was the Aggreſſor; and put the King
upon thoſe unheard-of ways to ſupport theſe Wars, that never
were practiſed by any King of <hi>England</hi> before; and in the ill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of them, brought greater Loſs and Diſhonour to the
Nation than ever was before: A Favourite, who beſides theſe,
brought the Crown to extream Poverty, to ſupport his intolerable
Ambition and Avarice.</p>
                  <p>Here again I cannot but note the miſerable State of Princes,
who treat their Subjects as Enemies, and their Favourites as
their only Friends and Confidents above other Men: for other
Mens Enemies are but few, and the reſt of Mankind their Friends;
but the Majeſty, Glory and Honour of a Prince, is founded in
the Love and Obedience of his Subjects; and if this be loſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
then can a Prince betake himſelf? What became of <hi>Edw.</hi> 2.
and <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. (tho two of thoſe four Hereditary Princes, of ten
after the Conqueſt) when they had loſt the Love and Obedience
of their Subjects? and this Prince, and his Sons after him, made
haſte to overtake their Fate: Not one many hundreds of private
Men, but die a natural Death, but,

But above all, thoſe of this <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Race of Kings, deſcended
from <hi>Elizabeth More,</hi> which 'tis a queſtion, whether any one of
Nine of them in a continued Succeſſion, died a Natural Death.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> upon his Retreat from the Iſle of
<hi>Rhee,</hi> promiſed the <hi>Rochellers</hi> to ſend them ſpeedy Relief; and to
make good his Word, ſent the Earl of <hi>Denbigh</hi> (his Brother-in-law)
with a Fleet to relieve it, now cloſe beſieged by the <hi>French</hi>
King; the Earl came before <hi>Rochel</hi> the firſt of <hi>May</hi> 1628, where
he found the <hi>French</hi> Fleet of 20 Sail had blockt up <hi>Rochel</hi> by Sea;
upon the Approach of the Earl, the <hi>French</hi> retired towards their
Fortifications, and anchored within two Cannon ſhot of the Fleet,
and ſo continued till the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>May:</hi> the Earl promiſed the <hi>Rochel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>
to ſink the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, when the Waters encreaſed, and the
Wind came <hi>Weſterly,</hi> it being then neap Tides; but two Days after
the Waters did encreaſe, and the Wind became <hi>Weſterly,</hi> then the
Earl being intreated to fight the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, did not, but weighed
Anchor, and came away, only four of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet at a diſtance
purſuing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet. Thus was the Duke's Expedition to
the Iſle of <hi>Rhee</hi> ſeconded by this of his Brother-in-law for the
Relief of <hi>Rochel.</hi> I do not find the Parliament took notice of this,
but if they had it had been to no purpoſe; for ſoon after the

Loans, Benevolences, Coat and Conduct Money, raiſed by
his Father and himſelf, without Conſent of Parliament? Let any
Man ſhew in any Records of time, that half ſo much in like time
was raiſed by any of our Kings upon any Occaſions, except the
Diſſolution of <hi>Abbeys</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII's time: Search all Hiſtories,
and find any one Prince ſo wilfully ſet to be govern'd by ſuch looſe,
vain, wild and negligent Councils, as either of theſe Princes,
Father or Son.</p>
                  <p>Now let's ſee the Condition of theſe poor <hi>Rochellers,</hi> truſting
to this Prince and his Favourite; they lived long upon Horſe-fleſh,
Hides, Leather, Dogs and Cats, hardly leaving a Horſe
alive, ſtill in hopes of the Relief promiſed from <hi>England:</hi> they
held out ſo long, till but 4000 of 15000 were left alive; moſt
of them died of Famine, and when they began to be pinch'd
with Extremity of Hunger, they died ſo faſt, that they uſually
carried their Coffins into the Church-yard, and other Places, and
therein laid themſelves, and died; great Numbers of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unburied, and many Corps eaten with Vermin, Ravens and
Birds, when the <hi>French</hi> Army entred the Town. The Outrages
committed againſt the Reformed Churches in <hi>France</hi> were ſo high,
as conſtrained them to implore King <hi>Charles</hi> his Aid, in theſe
Expreſſions, <hi>That what they wrote was with their Tears and Blood.</hi>
But how unhappy ſoever this Prince's Fate was in War abroad,
yet it had been happy for him, if he had not made his Fate worſe
at home; and now let us ſee what Steps he made towards it,
even in this ſhort Receſs of the Parliament's Meeting.</p>
                  <p>Upon the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> the King made Sir <hi>Richard Weſton</hi>
(who died a declared Papiſt) Lord Treaſurer of <hi>England;</hi> and
the ſame Day tranſlated <hi>Laud,</hi> (the Firebrand of the <hi>Arminian</hi>
Faction) to the Biſhoprick of <hi>London,</hi> whoſe next Step was Arch-biſhop
of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> who that he might teſtify his Zeal to this
Cauſe, which after ſet all theſe Nations on Fire, got <hi>Richard
Mountague</hi> to be conſecrated Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> the <hi>24th</hi> of
<hi>Auguſt</hi> following.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Mountague</hi> was fierce for <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> and wrote a Book,
call'd <hi>A new Gag for an old Gooſe;</hi> for which he was queſtioned
in the Parliament of 23 <hi>Jac.</hi> and the Cauſe was committed
to Arch-biſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> which then ended in an Admonition;
and though the Arch-biſhop diſallowed the Book, and ſought
to ſuppreſs it, yet it was reprinted and dedicated to King <hi>Charles</hi>
under the Title of <hi>Appello Caeſarem:</hi> Hereupon the Commons,
1 <hi>Car.</hi> queſtioned <hi>Mountague</hi> for this, and gave Thanks to the
Arch-biſhop for what he had done; but this diſpleaſed the King,
who took the Buſineſs out of the Commons Hands: but they had
taken Bond of <hi>Mountague</hi> to appear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:60932:116"/>
I deſire to be more particular herein, becauſe <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> was
not only turn'd up Trump for the flattering Clergy to play their
Game, but for the Popiſh Party to undermine the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> as it was eſtabliſhed by Law, and the Canons, Doctrine
and Homilies of it; and now <hi>Mountague</hi>'s Cauſe was recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> by the Biſhops of <hi>Rocheſter, Oxford,</hi>
and <hi>Laud</hi> Biſhop of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> as the Cauſe of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> Thus this Cauſe ſtood, when the King diſſolved the firſt
Parliament the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1625.</p>
                  <p>But the King's Neceſſities, as he managed Buſineſs, forcing him
to call another; before aſſembled, <hi>Laud</hi> procured the Duke to
ſound the King, whether he would leave <hi>Mountague</hi> to a Trial in
Parliament, which the King intended to do; whereupon this pious
Man <hi>Laud</hi> ſaid, <hi>I ſeem to ſee a Cloud ariſing and threatning the
Church of</hi> England; <hi>God of his Mercy diſſipate it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, that all thoſe who were not of this Faction of <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm,</hi>
were ſtiled by them <hi>Puritans:</hi> theſe <hi>Mountague</hi> treats with
bitter Railing, and injurious Speeches; and inſerts divers paſſages
in his Appeal, diſhonourable to King <hi>James;</hi> the Commons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
prayed that the ſaid <hi>Mountague</hi> might be exemplarily puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
and his Books ſuppreſt and burnt. Yet this is the Saint that
<hi>Laud</hi> in the firſt Act of his Regency, as it may be called, after he
became Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> muſt have made Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi>
and after Biſhop of <hi>Norwich.</hi> But this is obſervable, that while
<hi>Neal</hi> and <hi>Laud</hi> were conſecrating <hi>Mountague,</hi> News came of the
Duke's being ſtabb'd.</p>
                  <p>This was the firſt ſtep after <hi>Laud</hi>'s Preferment; the next was
a Pardon for <hi>Mountague</hi> and <hi>Manwaring</hi> of all Errors by ſpeaking,
writing and printing: and you cannot believe that <hi>Laud</hi> would
be leſs kind to <hi>Manwaring</hi> than to <hi>Mountague;</hi> and therefore not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<hi>Manwaring</hi>'s Cenſure, he procured <hi>Manwaring</hi> the
fat Rectory of <hi>Stamford Rivers</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and a Diſpenſation to
hold it with the Rectory of St. <hi>Giles in the Fields.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That you may ſee the Kindneſs of this Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> to our
Laws in the very Infancy of his Power: When <hi>Felton</hi> was brought
before the Lords of the Council for murdering the Duke; <hi>Laud</hi>
threatned <hi>Felton</hi> with the Rack, unleſs he would confeſs his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement
for murdering the Duke; but the King then in Council
refuſed till the Judges were conſulted, and ſaid if it could be
done by Law, he would not uſe his Prerogative; but though the
Judges determined he could not be put to the Rack by Law, the
King was graciouſly pleaſed not to uſe his Prerogative, yet this
was no thanks to the Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let's ſee the Fruits of the Petition of Right, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold-Declarations
of the King for maintaining the Laws of the
Land, and the juſt Rights and Liberties of the Subject; but here
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60932:117"/>
you may underſtand, that though he had taken the Cuſtoms not
granted by Parliament, yet by virtue of his Prerogative Royal, he
had enhanced the Rates, ſuch as were never granted by any
Parliament, and declared it his abſolute Will and Pleaſure (beſides
that of Wines) that the 2 <hi>s.</hi> and 2 <hi>d.</hi> Duties upon every Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of Currants by the Book of Rates, ſhould be advanced to
5 <hi>s.</hi> and 6 <hi>d.</hi> in the Hundred.</p>
                  <p>The firſt that ſuffer'd under the King's abſolute Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
was Mr. <hi>Chambers,</hi> who was committed by the Lords of the
Council this <hi>Michaelmaſs</hi>-Term, and was bailed by the Court of
<hi>King's-Bench;</hi> for which the Judges were check'd, having done it
without due Reſpect to the Privy-Council.</p>
                  <p>Next, Mr. <hi>Vaſſal</hi>'s Goods were ſeized, for not paying the 5 <hi>s.
6 d.</hi> upon every hundred pound Weight of Currants; upon which
the Attorney General, Sir <hi>Robert Heath,</hi> exhibited an Information
againſt him in the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> to which Mr. <hi>Vaſſal</hi> pleaded the
Statute, <hi>De Tallagio non concedendo,</hi> and that this was neither <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiqua
ſeu Recta Conſuetudo:</hi> to which the Attorney demurred, and
Mr. <hi>Vaſſal</hi> joined in the Demurrer; but the Court would not hear
Mr. <hi>Vaſſal</hi>'s Counſel, and ſaid the King was in Poſſeſſion, and they
would keep him ſo, and impriſoned Mr. <hi>Vaſſal</hi> for not paying the
Duty thus impoſed.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi>'s Goods were ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Cuſtomers, for not paying ſuch Cuſtoms as were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Farmers: Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi> ſues a Writ of <hi>Replevin,</hi>
the Barons grant an Injunction againſt it; Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi> offers to
give Security for Payment of ſuch Duties as the Court ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect;
which the Court refuſed, unleſs he ſhould pay ſuch Cuſtoms
as demanded by the Farmers; which <hi>Chambers</hi> refuſing, the Court
ordered the Officers to detain double the Value of <hi>Chambers</hi>'s
Goods demanded by them. The ſame Courſe was taken with
Mr. <hi>Rolls</hi>'s Goods, though a Parliament-Man; one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
ſaying, <hi>Privilege of Parliament extended only to Perſons,
not Goods:</hi> another more boldly told Mr. <hi>Rolls, if all the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were in you, we would take your Goods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Proceedings ſo ill ſorting with the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> the
King (as <hi>Norton</hi> the Printer ſaid) commanded the printing of
the Petition, with other Additions, beſides the King's Anſwer;
and that he had printed 1500 Copies with the King's Anſwer,
without the other Additions: but theſe were ſuppreſſed by War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and the Attorney General commanded no more ſhould be
printed, and thoſe which were ſhould not be divulged. Theſe
were the Juſt and Religious Acts of this pious King: and can any
Man believe the Parliament at their Meeting, ſhould without
Breach of a publick Truſt, ſit ſtill, and not repreſent theſe things
to the King?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:60932:117"/>
The Parliament did meet according to their Prorogation the <hi>23d</hi>
of <hi>January,</hi> 1628. and debated theſe Practices againſt Church
and State, which hapned ſince the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> before: but now
ſee the Artifice of this little Prince, rather than hear of any thing
in this kind, he commands the Speaker, Sir <hi>John Finch</hi> (the
late Lord Chancellor <hi>Finch</hi>'s own Uncle) to put no Queſtion upon
Debates of Grievances. So that the Houſe could do nothing but
ſit ſtill or adjourn, and this continued till the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> when
the Commons met and urged the Speaker to put the Queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Grievances; who anſwered, I have a Command from the
King to adjourn the Houſe till the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and put no
Queſtion; and endeavouring to go out of the Houſe, he was held
by ſome Members, till the Houſe had made this Proteſtation.</p>
                  <p>1. Whoſoever ſhall bring in Innovation of Religion, or by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
or Countenance, ſeem to extend or introduce Popery or <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm,</hi>
or other Opinions, diſagreeing from the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi>
Church, ſhall be reputed a Capital Enemy to this Kingdom,
or Common-Wealth.</p>
                  <p>2. Whoſoever ſhall counſel or adviſe the taking or levying the
Subſidies of Tunnage and Poundage not granted by Parliament,
or ſhall be an Actor or Inſtrument therein, be likewiſe reputed an
Innovator in the Government, and a Capital Enemy to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>3. If any Merchant or Perſon whatſoever, ſhall voluntarily
yield, or pay the Subſidies of Tunnage and Poundage, not being
granted by Parliament, he ſhall likewiſe be reputed a betrayer of
the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> and an Enemy to the ſame.</p>
                  <p>This Act conſiſted in two Parts, the Speaker and the Houſe;
the Speaker's of three Parts, a Command by the King to put no
Queſtion, to adjourn till the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and an endeavour to
go out of the Houſe. In the former Seſſion of this Parliament,
Secretary <hi>Cook,</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> from the King deſired the
Houſe not to make any Receſs thoſe <hi>Eaſter</hi> Holy-days, that the
World may now take notice how earneſt his Majeſty, and We were
for the publick Affairs in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> which would receive Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
by this Receſs.</p>
                  <p>To which Sir <hi>Robert Phillips</hi> anſwered, that the <hi>12th</hi> and <hi>18th
Jac.</hi> the Houſe reſolved it was in their Power to adjourn, or ſit;
and that this may be put upon them by Princes of leſs Piety; and
that a Committee conſider of the Houſe's Right. Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>
ſaid, the King makes a Prorogation; the Houſe adjourns it ſelf:
That a Commiſſion of Adjournment the Houſe never read, but ſay,
the Houſe adjourns it ſelf; yet here the Speaker verbally ſays, I
am commanded by the King to adjourn till the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>March.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:60932:118"/>
His ſecond Command was to put no Queſtion. So here was a
Speaker which might not ſpeak: what did he there then? He ſits
there by the King in his Higheſt and Regal Capacity, under the
broad Seal, to put the Queſtion; and now if you'll take his Word,
he ſays, he has a Command from the King to put no Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>The third Act was his Endeavour to go out of the Houſe; which
the Houſe, conceiving him to be their Servant, would not ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Here you may underſtand that the King had privately made
Peace with <hi>France,</hi> though not proclaimed at <hi>Paris</hi> till <hi>June</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
and ſoon after with <hi>Spain;</hi> ſo that in his Speech, this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he did not begin with, <hi>The Times are for Action, and the Eyes
of all the World are upon us;</hi> and therefore demands Supplies
in the firſt place, but that without loſs of Time they would paſs
the Bill of Tunnage and Poundage: but the Houſe ſeeing the
Dangers of the Church and State, in not only pardoning, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
<hi>Mountague</hi> and <hi>Manwaring,</hi> and ſeizing Merchants Goods,
and impriſoning their Perſons, even in this Receſs; they reſolve
to ſecure their Religion, and redreſs Grievances, before they
grant the Cuſtoms of Tunnage and Poundage: in both they could
not but take notice of the Orders of the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> Privy-Council,
Judges and Cuſtomers. And theſe were the Invaſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the King's Perogative Royal, which for the future he reſolved
never to ſuffer; yet he ſhall live to hear more of them.</p>
                  <p>But in regard it may ſeem ſtrange, that Cuſtoms of Tunnage
and Poundage, ever ſince the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> had been
granted to the Kings and Queens of this Realm, for ſecuring the
Soveraignty of the narrow Seas, and of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants,
yet was not granted to this King: The Reaſon was this, the Houſe
of Commons in their Grievances in the two firſt Parliaments of this
King, and the former Seſſions of this, complained, that the Duke
of <hi>Buckingham</hi> being Lord High Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> neglected to
guard the Seas, to the Diſhonour of the King, and endangering
the Trade of <hi>England;</hi> and feared, if the Duke were not removed,
the End deſigned by the Parliament would be diverted, to ſupply
the intolerable Pride and Luxury of the Duke: but the King
rather than endure this, diſſolved the two former Parliaments,
and prorogued this when they were upon ſettling the Duties of
Tunnage and Poundage.</p>
                  <p>That the Parliament had Reaſon for this, it appears in their
Charge againſt the Duke, in the <hi>2d</hi> Year of this King, and that
in ten Years time he had received of King <hi>James</hi> and this King
284395 <hi>l.</hi> beſides the Foreſt of <hi>Leyfield,</hi> the Profits of the third
of Strangers Goods, and the Profits of the Moiety of the Cuſtoms
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> beſides the Tricks he uſed to get Money, as he was
Lord High Admiral of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Maſter of the Horſe,
Lord Warden, Chancellor and Admiral of the Cinque Ports and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60932:118"/>
the Members thereof, Conſtable of <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle, Juſtice in Eyre
of all his Majeſty's Foreſts and Chaſes on this ſide of <hi>Trent,</hi>
Conſtable of <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle, and Gentleman of the King's Bed-Chamber.</p>
                  <p>To theſe might have been added the Duke's Venality, in ſelling
all Places in Church and State, at leaſt preferring ſuch Men in
Church, as ſhould propagate <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> and ſuch Judges as
ſhall do what the King and he bid them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection.</hi> But the Duke was now dead in this Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſo the Reaſon ceaſing, the Duties of Tunnage and
Poundage ought to have been granted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The King would not ſuffer the Commons to come at it,
neither in the laſt Seſſions nor this: for the Religion of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Laws and Liberties of the Subject,
being ſo ſhaken in this Receſs, the Commons reſolve that Religion
ſhall have the Precedency in their Debates, and make this Vow:</p>
                  <p>WE the Commons in Parliament aſſembled, do claim, proteſt,
and avow for Truth, the Senſe of the Articles of Religion,
which were eſtabliſhed by Parliament, in the 13th Year of the Reign
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which by the Publick Acts of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and by the general and currant Expoſition of the Writers of our
Church, have been delivered unto <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s. And we Reject the Senſe of the
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> and all others wherein they differ from us.</p>
                  <p>But the true Reaſon why the King would not take the Duties of
Tunnage and Poundage from the Commons, was, for fear the
Commons ſhould not grant the Duties impoſed by his Father, and
taken by him; which he was reſolved to continue, whether the
Parliament would or not.</p>
                  <p>The Houſe had a Petition from the <hi>Printers</hi> and <hi>Bookſellers</hi> in
<hi>London,</hi> complaining, that <hi>Laud</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> (who had been
ſo but from the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> laſt) had reſtrained Books written
againſt <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> and the contrary allowed of on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by him, and had ſent Purſevants for many <hi>Printers</hi> and <hi>Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers,</hi>
who had printed Books againſt <hi>Popery;</hi> and that Licenſing
Books, was only reſtrained to the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> and his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,
<hi>[This is the Patron and Saint-like Martyr of the Church of</hi>

Sir <hi>John Elliot</hi>'s Speech againſt <hi>Neal</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> (a

building upon thoſe Grounds, laid by his great Maſter the Duke;
and that his Spirit is moving to theſe Interruptions, and they for
fear break Parliaments, leſt the Parliament ſhould break them:
That he finds him the Head of all the great Party; That <hi>Papiſts,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60932:119"/>
Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> derive from him their Shelter and Protection,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Speaker upon Motion of the Houſe, refuſed to put
the Queſtion, being he ſaid otherwiſe commanded by the King:
Whereupon the Houſe adjourn'd till <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the <hi>25th,</hi> and from
thence to the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>March;</hi> when the Speaker again refuſed to put
the Queſtion, the Succeſs whereof was ſaid before. What now
was the Crime of the Houſe? It was their Endeavour to preſerve
the Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the Subjects of <hi>England;</hi> and ſince the Speaker refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

King, they made their Proteſtation in the Defence of the Church
and State: And Maſters oft-times upon Diſobedience of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
do that which at other times they would not have done.</p>
                  <p>The King having made Peace abroad, was reſolved now to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute

King with Judges, Privy-Counſellors, and <hi>Star-Chamber-Men,</hi>
who ſhould do the King's Work; and now let's ſee the Order and
Method by which it was carried on.</p>
                  <p>Upon this very Day, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> a Proclamation
was drawn for the Diſſolution of the Parliament, but not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed;
the King afterwards doing it himſelf in Perſon upon

next day: Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>John Elliot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Valentine</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Coriton</hi> appeared; and for refuſing to anſwer out of Parliament,
for what was ſaid or done in Parliament, were committed cloſe
Priſoners to the <hi>Tower;</hi> and Warrants were given for ſealing up
the Studies of Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> Sir <hi>John Elliot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Long,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Stroud,</hi> who not then appearing, a Proclamation was iſſued
out for apprehending of them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> the King comes into the Houſe of Lords,
and tells the Reaſons of his Diſſolution of the Parliament, that
it was the <hi>undutiful and ſeditious Carriage in the lower Houſe,</hi> but ſays
not wherein; calls them <hi>Vipers,</hi> who muſt look for their Reward
and Puniſhment, but promiſes the Lords the Favour and Protection
that a good King oweth to his loving and faithful Nobility: and
then the Lord Keeper diſſolved the Parliament.</p>

in 1640.</head>
                  <p>JUſtice like Truth is one, and conſiſts in entire Parts, and will
not admit of more or leſs; but Injuſtice, like Falſhood and
Error, is diſtracted into infinite Diſcord and Confuſion. King
<hi>James</hi> upon the Diſſolution of the Parliament of the <hi>12th</hi> and
<hi>18th</hi> Years of his Reign, without any Trial, but only by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of his own Will, commits ſeveral Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Priſon, for preſuming to repreſent the Grievances of the
Nation to him for Redreſs, without Bail or Main-prize: But this
King puts a face of Juſtice upon his fining and impriſoning the
Members of Parliament for their Debates and Tranſactions in it;
which was ſo much worſe than his Father's Actions, by how much
the affixing a ſacred Character to a bad Act (and Juſtice is ſacred)
renders the Act ſo much worſe, as Perjury is a greater Crime than
ſimple Falſhood; and to murder a Man under pretence of Juſtice,
a greater Crime than ſimple Murder.</p>
                  <p>The Members thus cloſe impriſoned, after the Diſſolution of
the Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> in Trinity-Term following, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> was
brought by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> with the Cauſe of his
Detainer; and alſo the ſame day Sir <hi>Miles Hobert,</hi> Mr. <hi>Benjamin
Valentine,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> appeared by <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> directed to their
ſeveral Priſons, with their Counſel to argue their ſeveral Caſes.
But when the Court were prepared to give their Opinions, the
Priſoners were not brought according to the Rule of Court. Then
Proclamation was made to the Keepers of the ſeveral Priſons to
bring their Priſoners, but none appeared: But the Marſhal of the
<hi>King's-Bench</hi> ſaid that Mr. <hi>Stroud</hi> was removed out of his Cuſtody
the day before to the <hi>Tower,</hi> by the King's own Warrant, and ſo
it was done by the other Priſoners. But in the Evening the
Judges received a Letter from the King, containing Reaſons why
he would not ſuffer the Priſoners to appear, yet that <hi>Selden</hi> and
<hi>Valentine</hi> ſhould appear the next day; and about three Hours
after the Judges received other Letters, that upon mature Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
neither <hi>Selden</hi> nor <hi>Valentine</hi> ſhould appear. And the
ſame <hi>Term</hi> four Conſtables of <hi>Hertfordſhire</hi> pray'd <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>'s
to ſeveral Purſevants, to whom they were committed by the
Lords of the Privy-Council, which were granted, but then they
are committed to other Purſevants, and ſo they were upon every
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60932:120"/>
other <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> ſo that the Conſtables could have no benefit
of them.</p>
                  <p>The Members as well as the Conſtables being thus ſhifted from
one Priſon to others, to prevent the Returns of their <hi>Habeas
Corpus</hi>'s, by ſpecial Order from the King, the Attorney-General
Sir <hi>Robert Heath</hi> preferred an Information in the Star-Chamber
againſt Sir <hi>John Elliot,</hi> and others of the Members therein named,
ſetting forth their Miſdemeanours in the late Parliament, and all
thoſe Proceedings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But Mr.</hi> Long'<hi>s Charge was different from thoſe of the other
Members,</hi> viz. Not for Miſdemeanours in Parliament, but that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his Oath, being when he was made Sheriff, and was by his
Oath to keep within his County, yet he did come to Parliament and
ſerve as a Member there, and in the time of Parliament reſided out
of his County.</p>
                  <p>To this Mr. <hi>Long</hi> pleaded, that the Oath of a Sheriff to reſide
in his County, does not exempt him from obeying the King's
Commands out of the County when the King requires it, and that
by the King's Command in his higheſt Capacity, he being choſen
a Member of Parliament, was obliged as well by the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
as by a Truſt repoſed in him by his County, to ſerve as a
Member of Parliament; <hi>Yet by a Sentence in the Star-Chamber he
was fined 2000 Marks to the King, to be impriſoned in the</hi> Tower,
<hi>and to make a Submiſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Attorney-General putting the Queſtion to the Judges
upon the Proceedings <hi>Ore tenus</hi> in the Star-Chamber againſt the
Parliament-Men, the Judges held it the juſter way not to proceed
<hi>Ore tenus.</hi> And Juſtice <hi>Whitlock</hi> did often and highly complain
againſt this way of ſending to the Judges for their Opinions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand;
and ſaid, <hi>that if Biſhop</hi> Laud <hi>went on this way, he would
kindle, a Flame in the Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Hollis, Selden, Stroud</hi> and <hi>Valentine,</hi> having been brought to
the King's-Bench Bar by ſeveral <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>'s, and Cauſe of their
Commitment returned, one on a Warrant from the Council, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on a Warrant from the King for <hi>Sedition and Contempts;</hi> and
whether this was a good Return or not was argued.</p>
                  <p>The Judges were perplexed about the <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and wrote
a humble and ſtout Letter to the King, <hi>That by their Oaths they
were to bail the Priſoners;</hi> but thought fit before they did it, or
publiſh their Opinions therein, to inform his Majeſty thereof, and
humbly to adviſe him (as had been done by his noble Progenitors
in like caſe) to ſend a Direction to his Juſtices of his Bench to
bail the Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>But the Lord Keeper <hi>(Coventry)</hi> would not acknowledg to
Juſtice <hi>Whitlock,</hi> who was ſent to him from the reſt of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
about this Buſineſs, that he had ſhewed the Judges Letter
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60932:120"/>
to the King, but diſſembled the matter, and told him that he
and his Brethren muſt attend the King at <hi>Greenwich</hi> at a day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly the Judges attended the King, who was not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with their Determination, but commanded them not to deliver
any Opinion in this Caſe without conſulting the reſt of the Judges,
who delayed the Buſineſs, and would hear Arguments in the Caſe,
as well as the Judges of the King's-Bench had done, and ſo the
Buſineſs was put off to the end of the Term: Then the Court
of King's-Bench being ready to deliver their Opinions, the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
were removed to other priſons; and a Letter came from the
King to the Judges, <hi>That this was done becauſe of their inſolent Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
at the Bar,</hi> and ſo they did not appear.</p>
                  <p>The Judges of the King's-Bench were ſent to by the Lord-keeper
to be in <hi>London</hi> on <hi>Michaelmas-day,</hi> and the Chief Juſtice
and Juſtice <hi>Whitlock</hi> were ſent for to the King at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi>
who adviſed with them about the impriſoned Members;
and upon the firſt day of the Term Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> moved for the
Members to have the Reſolution of the Court: All the Judges
declared, that they were contented the Priſoners ſhould be bailed,
but that they muſt find Sureties for their good Behaviour; <hi>If this
Addition of finding Sureties for the Members good Behaviour were part
of the good Offices which the Judges did (as Mr.</hi> Whitlock <hi>ſays) to
bring the King to heal the Breaches,</hi> the Members had little Reaſon
to thank them for their Pains.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> pray'd that his Sureties for his Bailment might be
taken, and the Matter of the good Behaviour omitted as a diſtinct
thing: So did the reſt of the Members, whereupon the Court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to the Tower; <hi>which I ſuppoſe is extraordinary, the
Court having them in their Power, and the Tower no Priſon of theirs
in ſuch Caſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſame Term the King's Attorney <hi>(Heath)</hi> exhibited an
Information againſt Sir <hi>John Elliot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hollis, Selden</hi> and <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
in the King's-Bench, ſetting forth the Matters in effect as were
in the Information in the Star-Chamber: to which the Defendants
pleaded to the Juriſdiction of the Court; <hi>becauſe the Offences are
ſaid to be committed in Parliament, and ought not to be puniſhed in this
or any other Court, except the Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King's Attorney moved the Court to over-rule the Plea, tho
he did not demur to it; but the Court would not, and gave a day
to join in Demurrer, and to have the Point argued; and in <hi>Hillary</hi>-Term
the Judges over-ruled their Plea, and the Defendants were
ruled to plead further, but they would not; whereupon Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was given againſt them upon a <hi>Nihil dicit, That they ſhould
be impriſoned, and not delivered till they had given Sureties for their
good Behaviour, and made a Submiſſion and Acknowledgment of their
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60932:121"/>
Offences,</hi> and they were alſo fined; and what their Fines were
you may read in the Appendix of the firſt Part of <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>'s
Collections.</p>
                  <p>But herein the Judges were not all of one piece, for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
and honourable Gentleman Sir <hi>John Walter,</hi> Chief Baron
of the Exchequer, and who was no <hi>Durante bene placito</hi>-man, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
from the reſt of the Judges, whereupon the King diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
him from his Place. I have heard my Father ſay, that
when Sir <hi>John</hi> received the King's Meſſage, he returned Anſwer,
that he was intruſted by the King in that Office, <hi>quam diu bene ſe
geſſerit,</hi> and that the Law was free for any Man to proſecute him
if he had ill demeaned himſelf in it; but to forſake his Station
any other way, implied Guilt, which he was not conſcious to
himſelf of: and therefore tho the King ſent him his <hi>Quietus,</hi> yet
he retained the Perquiſites of his Place to his Death.</p>
                  <p>A little before the Members Sentence in the King's Bench, the
King's Attorney exhibited an Information againſt one <hi>Chambers</hi> a
Merchant, for ſaying, <hi>Merchants have more Incouragement, and are
leſs ſcrewed up in</hi> Turkey <hi>than in</hi> England. <hi>Chambers</hi> confeſt the
Words, but he ſpake them of the under Officers of the Cuſtoms,
who had much wronged him, without reflecting upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
yet the Court fined him 2000 <hi>l.</hi> and to make a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
which he refuſed as <hi>unjuſt and falſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fine was eſtreated into the Exchequer, where he pleaded
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and other Statutes againſt the Fine, <hi>it not being by
legal Judgment of his Peers, nor ſaving his Merchandiſe:</hi> but the
Barons would not ſuffer his Plea to be filed; and afterwards he
brought his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> but the Judges remanded him. Thus
you ſee what Fruits the Petition of Right (paſſed but the Year
before) had, and the King's repeated Declarations to maintain the
Laws of the Land, and the Liberty and Property of the Subject.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But if this Prince has not kept his Word for the time paſt, he
will keep it he ſays for the time to come, in the Declaration he
made for the Diſſolution of this laſt Parliament. I do not find
the Date of it, yet it begins with the uſual Prologue;</hi> However,
Princes are not bound to give an account of their Actions but only to
God. <hi>In this the King ſays nothing of the Eyes of all</hi> Chriſtendom
<hi>being upon him,</hi> but tells how the Aids granted this laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were for Payment of his Fleet and Army; and that with part
of thoſe Monies he began to ſupply his Magazines and Stores, and to
put his Navy into a conſtant Form and Order; and that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Provocations of evil Men (whoſe Puniſhment he reſerves to a
due time) he will maintain the Eſtabliſhed Religion and Doctrine of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the antient and juſt Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Subject: Yet as he will maintain the Subjects Rights, ſo
he expects that they yield as much Submiſſion and Duty to his Royal
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60932:121"/>
Prerogative, and as ready Obedience to his Authority and Command,
as had been performed to any of his Predeceſſors. Then wills his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
not to be terrified by the harſh Proceedings ſtrained againſt them;
for as he will ſupport them by his Authority and Prerogative, ſo he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
they ſhould obey him, and that he will receive the Cuſtoms, and
the Duty of Five in the 100; and if any factious Merchants refuſe
to pay, they ſhall be aſſured he will find honourable and juſt means to
ſupport his Eſtate and Soveraignty, and preſerve the Authority God had
put into his Hands: and for this, his Subjects ought to acknowledg
their own Bleſſedneſs, and for the ſame to be thankful to God, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of all Goodneſs. <hi>For this you muſt take the Prince's Word for
the next twelve Years. But being thus great and happy at Home,
let's ſee what is doing Abroad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The War againſt <hi>France</hi> was not more inconſiderately begun
about two Years before, than the Peace made with it was ſecret:
The firſt time it was made known was when the <hi>French</hi> King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
<hi>Privas,</hi> he proclaimed the Peace with his good Brother of
<hi>England:</hi> The <hi>Reformed</hi> were aſtoniſhed and confounded, that the
King of <hi>England,</hi> who brought them into the War, ſhould leave
them out of the Peace: Hereupon <hi>Privas</hi> ſurrenders, ſo does
<hi>Caſtres</hi> and <hi>Niſmes;</hi> the great <hi>Rohan</hi> is forced to ſubmit and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
The Power of the <hi>Reformed</hi> thus rooted up; and while the
King of <hi>England</hi> is making War againſt the Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Richlieu</hi> marches with an Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> and takes <hi>Saluſſes</hi>
and <hi>Pignerol</hi> from the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richlieu</hi> having thus ſecured the King of <hi>England,</hi> took no leſs
care that the Empire ſhould not put a ſtop to the ſwelling Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of his Maſter, and to this purpoſe enters into a Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
with the Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> to call the King of
<hi>Sweden</hi> in to <hi>Germany,</hi> who next Year entred into it, where, for
eighteen Years, the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtant Princes joining the <hi>Swede,</hi> a
moſt dreadful War was raiſed all over <hi>Germany,</hi> ſo as the <hi>French</hi>
had no cauſe to fear any Danger thence; on the contrary, they
took <hi>Briſac,</hi> and other Places, and had opportunity to wreſt
<hi>Lorain</hi> from that Duke.</p>
                  <p>But King <hi>Charles</hi> proſpering, as he thought, in his Domeſtick
War, having taken more Priſoners in it, (I mean the Members of
Parliament, and Conſtables of <hi>Hertfordſhire)</hi> than his Father and
he had done in all their Wars againſt <hi>France, Spain</hi> and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
for the recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> was very unwilling to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into a Foreign; and therefore in a kind of petitioning way,
ſends Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> his Ambaſſador to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to take
care of the Patrimony of his Brother, but with no better Succeſs,
yet in a more rough, ſcornful and diſhonourable manner than his
Father's Ambaſſadors had with the Emperor. But that he might
ſeem to do ſomething, the King ſent Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton</hi> with
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60932:122"/>
6000 Men to aſſiſt the <hi>Swede;</hi> who, tho every-where elſe victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
yet this Army under <hi>Hamilton</hi> had worſe Succeſs than that
under <hi>Mansfield,</hi> being ſtarved and mouldred away almoſt to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and yet fought not at all; and being reduced to two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> would not permit King <hi>Charles</hi> to name
the Officers. <hi>[See</hi> Whitlock's <hi>M. f. 15. and</hi> Franklin's, <hi>Anno 1630.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ill Succeſs of <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Army put the King out of all
Conceit of proſecuting any Foreign War, and therefore wholly
makes it his Buſineſs to make himſelf more Abſolute at Home.
There is but one Rub in the way, <hi>viz.</hi> the great Prop of the
Church, the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury, Abbot,</hi> a Prelate of moſt
eminent Learning, whoſe upright Integrity ſtood as an unſhaken
Rock againſt the Innovations both in Church and State, which were
now ſo fiercely puſh'd on by the <hi>Arminians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I find but little Action in this Year 1631, things were only
preparing to what followed; yet altho Arch-biſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> was
living, the Torrent run ſo high in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> that
ſeveral of the Members were proceeded againſt and cenſured for
Sermons preach'd againſt <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> and expell'd the Univerſity,
and the Book of Sports and Paſtimes upon the Lord's-day was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiſhed:
Judg <hi>Richardſon</hi> was ſo hardy as to repreſs them, but
the Biſhops took this as an intruding upon the Eccleſiaſtical Power,
and Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> complained thereof to the King, and the Judg
was check'd for it. See <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s Memoirs, <hi>fol.</hi> 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>But in the Year 1632, this Reverend Prelate died, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
left room for <hi>Laud,</hi> the Fire-brand of <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> to take
Poſſeſſion. Before we ſee what follows, let's look back upon
what went before: He being of a reſtleſs aſpiring Temper, in the
beginning of King <hi>James</hi> his Reign got to be Chaplain to <hi>Mountjoy,</hi>
Earl of <hi>Devonſhire;</hi> and to ſhew he would be great upon any
account, he marries the Earl to the Lady <hi>Rich,</hi> tho her Husband
was then alive, and had many Children by her, <hi>viz. Robert,</hi> then
Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Holland:</hi> which Act ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
King <hi>James,</hi> that the Earl fell into his Diſpleaſure; and
tho <hi>Laud</hi> hanker'd near twenty Years after the Court to get Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
principally under the Countenance of <hi>Neal</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Wincheſter,</hi> yet the King would never endure to hear of it: But
at laſt, by the Importunity of <hi>Neal</hi> and others, <hi>Williams</hi> Biſhop
of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and Lord-Keeper, was prevailed upon to intercede for
him without any Succeſs, till at length the Keeper told the King,
<hi>It would be hard to ſerve a King who could not forgive one Fault.</hi>
At laſt he got the King to prefer <hi>Laud</hi> to the Biſhoprick of St. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids;</hi>
but he had not been ſcarce one Year in his Biſhoprick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he became <hi>Williams</hi> his bitter Enemy and Proſecutor, as you
may read in the ſecond Part of the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s Life; and
within leſs than three Years after he became Arch-biſhop, got the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60932:122"/>
Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> fined and impriſoned, and his Eſtate to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred
by an Order of the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and at laſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
he had never read the Commiſſion by which he acted. Theſe
things ſee in the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> par. 2. <hi>fol. 125. tit.</hi> 119.</p>
                  <p>Tho <hi>Laud</hi> had never read the Commiſſion by which he acted, yet
ſo zealous was he for the Execution of the Sequeſtration of the
Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s Eſtate, that he ſends this Warrant to the King's
Solicitor (I think Sir <hi>John Banks.)</hi> 
                     <q>It is his Majeſty's Pleaſure,
that you prepare a Commiſſion to the Prebendaries of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate
Church of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> authorizing them to keep their
Audits, and other Capitular Meetings at their uſual times; and
to treat and compound with the Tenants for Leaſes, and to paſs
the ſame accordingly, chuſe Officers, and confirm and execute
all other lawful Acts, for the good and benefit of the College and
ſaid Prebendaries: And to take out the Common or Charter-Seal,
for ſealing ſuch Leaſes and Grants as will be agreed upon
by the Sub-Dean and the major part of the Prebendaries; and
alſo to paſs all the Premiſſes under the Title of the Dean and
Chapter of the Collegiate Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
during the Suſpenſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> from the Deana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> and for doing whereof, this ſhall be your
Warrant.</q> 
                     <hi>Lambeth</hi>-Houſe, <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>November, 1637. W. Cant.</hi>
See <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s Memoirs, <hi>fol. 25. a.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether the King ever granted any ſuch Warrant to <hi>W. Cant.
non conſtat;</hi> for the King never ſpeaks to his Subjects but either
perſonally in Parliament, or under the Broad-ſeal, which here
does not appear; beſides, all Warrants of Courts are ſigned by the
Seals of the Courts, and executed by their proper and ſworn Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
neither of which were <hi>W. Cant.</hi> or the King's Solicitor. Yet
at this rate was this Nation ridden during the Regency of <hi>W. Cant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Phaeton</hi> thus mounted up on high, being the firſt Peer of
<hi>England,</hi> was yet higher in the King's Favour, than <hi>Richlieu</hi> was
with the <hi>French</hi> King. But as the Temper of theſe Princes and
their Favourites were different, ſo had they different Fates: <hi>Lewis</hi>
was ſteady and true to his Word, from whence he acquired the
Title of <hi>Juſt; Charles</hi> fickle and unſtable, eaſily put upon things
by his Favourites, and as ſuddenly altering them, and doing quite
contrary: from whence it was that <hi>Lewis</hi> ſupported the Cardinal
in all his Shocks of adverſe Fortune, and to the Indignation
of his Mother; whereas <hi>Charles,</hi> in the Adverſity of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
gave up <hi>Laud</hi> and all his Favourites as a Sacrifice to their
Enemies.</p>
                  <p>As the Fates of theſe Favourites were different, ſo were their
Parts, <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s High, Generous, and the ableſt Stateſman of the
Age; <hi>Laud</hi>'s Pedantick and Narrow. After the marrying the Lady
<hi>Rich</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> he ſpent his time in ſeeking 
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60932:123"/>
Preferment at Court; and in ſetting up Factions in the Univerſity
of <hi>Oxford</hi> for promoting <hi>Arminianiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richlieu</hi> was a Conſtant Aſſertor of the Privileges of the <hi>Gallican</hi>
Church, and a Hater of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> who bring in Innovations,
and exalt a Papal Power above them; whereas <hi>Laud,</hi> not only
brought Innovations into the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but was the Head
of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Party, under whoſe Banners the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Party
ſought to undermine and deſtroy the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richlieu</hi> laid the Foundation of the <hi>French</hi> King's Greatneſs by
Sea and Land; <hi>Laud</hi> put King <hi>Charles</hi> upon ſuch Ways, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Ruin of the King, Himſelf, and the Church and State of
<hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before we proceed herein, let us ſtay a little and conſider
the unhappy State of the Education of the Youth of <hi>England</hi> in
Grammer Schools and Univerſities.</p>
                  <p>The End deſigned by God and Nature, by Inſtruction of Youth,
is, to honour and worſhip God, and how to ſubſiſt and converſe
after they become Men; for without the latter it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to perform the former. I ſay, this latter no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
to the End, by breeding Youth up in Grammar-Schools,
and our Univerſities: for no Man lives out of Society and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;
and every Man ſtands in need of being ſupplied by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in things he ſtands in want of; ſo that the great End by
Education of Youth, is to inſtruct Youth how to ſupply another,
ſo as to be able by another to ſupply himſelf of ſuch things as he
ſtands in need of: but this is utterly neglected in Grammar-Schools,
and our Univerſities; and yet double more are bred up in Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar-Schools,
and our Univerſities, than the Revenues of the
Church can maintain; and this Breeding fits Youth for no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
and Buſineſs, but only puffs them up with a Conceit of
their Learning, when they underſtand not that of all Mankind they
are the moſt unlearned and unfit for any Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>The Supernumeraries of theſe unhappy Men, who can get no
Maintenance in the Church, and by their Breeding are of no uſe
in Church or State, yet deſire to live, but can get no Living, but
by nouriſhing Factions againſt thoſe who are preferred in the
Church and State. Poor Men! they know no better, and if this
be taken from them, they know not how to live: From whence it
follows, that unleſs theſe Supernumeraries be reſtrained in their
Education, which cannot be but by rooting out of Grammar-Schools,
and the chopping Logick in our Univerſities; whereby, I ſay,
no rational Propoſition, in any Art or Science, was ever inferred
from <hi>Ariſtotle, Deſcartes,</hi> or any ſince; theſe Supernumeraries will
as neceſſarily nouriſh Factions in <hi>England,</hi> as the Jeſuits do here,
and in the reſt of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:60932:123"/>
Many of theſe Supernumeraries got their Maintenance by being
Chaplains to Noble-men, and Gentlemen; but in both, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
more the Humour of the People where they were Lecturers,
and Diſpoſition of their Patrons and Patroneſſes where they were
Chaplains, than the Liturgy of this Church.</p>
                  <p>The Dioceſs of <hi>London</hi> was too contracted to reſtrain the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Ambition of this Biſhop; for the laſt Parliament was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
diſſolved, but <hi>Laud</hi> preſented the King with <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> for
the better ſetling <hi>Church-Government</hi> in both Provinces, of <hi>York</hi>
as well as <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>4th</hi> of theſe was, That a ſpecial Charge be given againſt
frequent and unworthy Ordinations; but <hi>Latet Anguis in Herba,</hi>
None ſhall be worthy but <hi>Arminians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>5th</hi> was, That ſpecial Care be had of our Lecturers in
every Dioceſs, which by reaſon of Pay, are the Peoples Creatures,
and blow the Bellows of their Sedition; But if the Biſhop will
not let them do this, they know no other way to live, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
would not ſtarve.</p>
                  <p>For abating the Peoples Power, the <hi>2d</hi> Conſideration is, That
every Biſhop in his Dioceſs ordain, that every Lecturer do read in
his Surplice <hi>Divine Service,</hi> before his Lecture; which if he does,
'tis twenty to one, thoſe that pay the Lecturer will pay no more:
What then becomes of the Lecturer? for there's no other Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
made for him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>6th</hi> is, That if a Corporation maintain a Lecturer, that he
be not permitted to preach, till he take care of Souls within the
Corporation: <hi>How this can be, I don't underſtand, unleſs the Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

have a concurring or diſtinct Power from the Incumbent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> 7th <hi>is, That none but Noble-men, and Men qualified by
law, may keep Chaplains.</hi> Yet in your Religious Care you take no
care how otherways they may ſubſiſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>8th</hi> is, That <hi>Emanuel</hi> and <hi>Sydney</hi> Colleges in <hi>Cambridg,</hi>
which are the Nurſeries of <hi>Puritaniſm,</hi> may be from time to time
furniſhed with Grave and Orthodox Men for their Governors,
<hi>viz. Such as ſhall do the</hi> Arminian <hi>Work, without any regard to the
Statutes of the College.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe Conſiderations muſt be taken for Acts of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and a Neglect, or Breach of them, ſufficient for an
Information in the <hi>High Commiſſion,</hi> where he is aſſured he ſhall
ſhortly judg; and therefore his Majeſty in the <hi>9th</hi> Conſideration,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to countenance the <hi>High Commiſſion,</hi> by the Preſence of ſome of
the Privy-Council, at leaſt ſo often as any Cauſe of Moment is to
be ſettled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> 10th <hi>Conſideration is, That Courſe may be taken, that the
Judges may not ſend ſo many Prohibitions;</hi> Which if they do from
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60932:124"/>
any of his Cenſures in the High Commiſſion, he will proceed against
them by Excommunication.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee this <hi>Icarus</hi> is not only content to take a Flight out of his
Dioceſs, but over the whole Provinces of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Canterbury</hi> in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Affairs, and extends it as he pleaſes over the Civil.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the Seeds which this Biſhop planted while he
was Biſhop of <hi>London;</hi> you may be ſure he'll reap a good Crop
now he's become Metropolitan of all <hi>England.</hi> During the time
of his being Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> he was look'd upon as the Riſing
Sun, which the flattering Students in both Univerſities worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;
but after he became Arch-Biſhop, the Learning of both
Univerſities were Brawls about <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenents in the Schools
and Sermons, The <hi>Arminians</hi> treating their Opponents with all
taunting and reproaching Terms; and if their Opponents retorted,
they were had up into the High Commiſſion, where the Arch-Biſhop
preſided, aſſiſted by his Eccleſiaſtical Judges, and Miniſters
of the Prerogative Court, and ſome of his Majeſty's Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
but I do not read of one cited for maintaining <hi>Arminian</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents.
It's ſcarce credible how the Buſineſs of this Court, the
<hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and Council-Table ſwelled, and what cruel and
unheard of Cenſures were made, eſpecially in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi>
againſt all ſorts of People, who did offend either againſt the King's
Prerogative Royal, or the Arch-biſhop's Injunctions, which muſt
be obeyed as Articles of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> The Thunder of
them was not reſtrained within the Bounds of <hi>England,</hi> but terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
almoſt all <hi>Scotland,</hi> who were bitter Enemies to <hi>Arminianiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this time of day the Court-Biſhops diſclaimed all Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from the King in <hi>Baſtwick</hi>'s Cenſure, who was to pay
1000 <hi>l.</hi> Fine, to be excommunicated, debarr'd of his Practice of
Phyſick, his Books to be burnt, and his Perſon impriſoned till he
made a Reclamation, and all this for maintaining the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
againſt the Papacy. See <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s <hi>Memoirs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Bounds of <hi>England</hi> were too narrow to reſtrain this Man's
Ambition; and therefore before he had been two Months Arch-biſhop,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1633. he adviſed the King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Correſpondence with the Biſhop of <hi>Dunblane,</hi> and to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to him his Majeſty's farther Pleaſure herein. And ſo we leave
the Affairs of the Church here for a while, and ſee how Affairs
ſtood in the State ſince the Diſſolution of the laſt Parliament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the laſt Parliament among many famous Members, Sir</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Wentworth <hi>and Mr.</hi> Noy <hi>excelled; Sir</hi> Thomas <hi>for his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Parts, and natural and eaſy Elocution;</hi> Noy, <hi>as a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Lawyer; both zealous Patriots for the Rights and Liberties
of the Subject. And upon the</hi> 12th <hi>of</hi> February, 1628. <hi>when
the Debates for granting Tunnage and Poundage to the King, was
in the Houſe of Commons, Mr.</hi> Noy <hi>argued,</hi> We cannot ſafely give,
unleſs we be in Poſſeſſion, and the Proceedings in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> be

to the <hi>Petition of Right;</hi> for it will not be a Gift but a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
neither will I give without the Removal of theſe Interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and a Declaration in the Bill, that the King has no Right, but
by our free Gift; if it will not be accepted as it is fit for us to give,
we cannot help it; if it be the King's already, we do not give it: <hi>So
that theſe two muſt be reckoned among thoſe</hi> Vipers, <hi>which the

                  </p>
                  <p>The Reward of Puniſhment, which theſe two <hi>Vipers</hi> had, was,
that Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> was made Lord Preſident of the <hi>North,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Noy</hi> Attorney General; Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ſtrained the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
ſo high, that it proved the Ruin of the Court, and the Riſe
of the Fame of Mr. <hi>Edward H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the Speech he made in 1641, againſt the Abuſes committed in
it, whilſt Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was Preſident; and <hi>Noy,</hi> now he is become
Attorney, is become the moſt intimate Confident of the Arch-biſhop,
and as forward in Informations in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> High
Commiſſion and Council-Table, as Sir <hi>Robert Heath</hi> was, who is
made Chief Juſtice in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> to make room for <hi>Noy</hi>
to be Attorney General.</p>
                  <p>But while the King was erecting this new Principality over his
Subjects, which none of his Anceſtors or Predeceſſors before his
Father and himſelf ever pretended to in <hi>England;</hi> it's fit to look a
little abroad, and ſee how the Caſe ſtood there.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch,</hi> the next Year after that his Father had given up
the <hi>Cautionary Towns,</hi> which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> kept, and delivered
up to him by her Death, well knowing the Poverty of King <hi>James,</hi>
and the ill Terms between the King and his Subjects, took the
Boldneſs to fiſh upon the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> with
their Buſſes and other Veſſels guarded by Men of War, in Defiance
of him; and now <hi>Grotius</hi> (no doubt ſet on work by ſome of his
Country-men) perceiving how intent King <hi>Charles</hi> was in erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his new Dominion over his Subjects, that he became careleſs
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60932:125"/>
of all his Foreign Affairs, took the Impudence to write a Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Treatiſe, called <hi>Mare Liberum,</hi> wherein he will not allow the
King to have any Title to the Soveraignty of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas, or
his Subjects any more Right to fiſh in them, than the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or
any other Nation. But how conſiſtible this Treatiſe is to Truth,
Antiquity, the ſacred Scriptures, or to <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf, or to the
Practice of his Country-Men, is now fit to be enquired into.
And ſince I have as well as I can aſſerted the Laws and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

an Engliſh-man, endeavour to vindicate the Honour of it
abroad, eſpecially in our King's Soveraignty of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas,
which <hi>Grotius</hi> ſo abſurdly in his <hi>Mare Liberum,</hi> endeavours to rob
them of.</p>
                  <p>An Anſwer to <hi>Grotius</hi> his <hi>Mare Liberum,</hi> wherein is ſhewed how
often he contradicts himſelf; how ignorant he is in all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Methods in Reaſoning; and how impoſſibly contrary
his pretended Arguments are to Sacred Hiſtory, and all antient
Authority.</p>
                  <p>But before we enter hereupon, it's fit to ſee, how the Caſe
ſtood before <hi>Grotius</hi> wrote his <hi>Mare Liberum,</hi> as well in reference to
the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Claim, as how the Caſe ſtood between the
King and <hi>Dutch,</hi> when <hi>Grotius</hi> wrote his <hi>Mare Liberum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that we may avoid the endleſs Confuſions, which <hi>Grotius</hi>
above all other Writers abounds in, I require theſe Premiſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That God made all things in the Waters, as well as upon
the Earth, for the Uſe of Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That no Man upon the Waters, as well as on the
Earth, did live out of Society.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That in Society the Offices of commanding and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
are neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That Anarchy is as abhorrent among Men upon the
Waters, as upon the firm Land; and as impoſſible for Men to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in the one as in the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Piracy by Sea, is a Crime equal to Theft by Land.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Killing a Man by Sea, without lawful Authority, is a
Crime equal to Murder by Land.</p>
                  <p>Note, <hi>Grotius</hi> anſwers not one of theſe Principles, nor ſhews
by any Authority, when or where the Dominion of the Seas was
by Uſurpation: Whereas the contrary has been practiſed by Kings
and States, as old as there are Records of any times; but only
feigns Premiſes, not only contrary to the Authority of ſacred
Hiſtory, and all Antiquity, but ſuch as are abſurd, blaſphemous,
and impoſſible, conſidering the Nature of Man: But theſe are
not ſaid in his <hi>Mare Liberum,</hi> but in his Preface and Treatiſe
of <hi>War and Peace.</hi> So that to have anſwered theſe in this Treatiſe,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60932:125"/>
would have ſwelled it to a much greater Bulk than intended; but
if God pleaſe, I ſhall hereafter anſwer theſe in a Treatiſe by
it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Principles thus premiſed, we proceed to enquire what So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have claimed in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas,
bordering upon <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſince that Kingdom became
ſubject to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> and leave it to unbiaſſed Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
whether the Kings of <hi>England</hi> claimed any thing contrary to
any of theſe Premiſes.</p>
                  <p>The Claims which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> make to the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas, are threefold:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. To protect their Subjects in all their juſt Employments upon
the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas, from all Hoſtility by Enemies; whereof the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in theſe Seas are the chief.</item>
                     <item>2. To prevent Hoſtility by other Nations in theſe Seas.</item>
                     <item>3. To receive an Acknowledgment from all Nations for their
Protection in theſe Seas, by ſtriking their Flag in Submiſſion to
the King's Men of War which protect them.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>By this Dominion of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> more
ſecure their Subjects from foreign Invaſion, than any other Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
in the World, how great ſoever their Territories are, can do.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſwell this Treatiſe with what Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> Sir <hi>John
Burroughs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> and others, have written of the Kings of
<hi>England</hi> being poſſeſt of theſe Rights by immemorial Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and of the Maritime Laws they have made, as well in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to their Subjects as Foreigners; nor of the Treaties they
have made with Foreign Princes, and the Compoſitions they have
made for Licence to fiſh in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas, before the <hi>Dutch</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was formed into States: nor was ever theſe Rights diſputed
by any of them, before <hi>Grotius</hi> did this Year.</p>
                  <p>Nor is this Dominion in the Seas new in the World, but as old
is any Records of Time; for of old the <hi>Egyptians, Phenicians,</hi> and
<hi>Athenians</hi> enjoyed it, and ſet Bounds to other Nations, how far
they would permit Nations to trade in them.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> in his Hiſtory of the World at large, ſets
forth the long Wars between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> in the
firſt <hi>Punick</hi> War for this Dominion; and the <hi>Romans</hi> being often
beaten by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> reſolved to deſiſt further Contention
herein, till they found that it was to little purpoſe to ſtrive to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
their Dominion by Land, if the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were Maſters
at Sea.</p>
                  <p>So that the Dominions of the Seas, which beat upon the Shores
of Princes, are not new, or only uſurped by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi>
but uſed by other Princes and States of old.</p>
                  <p>From more antient, to deſcend to more recent times; the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>In the Year 1630, <hi>Mary</hi> the Siſter of the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> being
eſpouſed to the Son of the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the Vice-Roy of
<hi>Naples</hi> provided a great Fleet to tranſport her to <hi>Trieſti;</hi> but tho
the <hi>Venetians</hi> were involved in a War abroad, and infected with a
Plague at home, they would not permit it; but conveyed her by
a Fleet of their own. See <hi>Jo. Palatius de Dom. Maris,</hi> l. 2. c. 6.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1638, a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet entring the Gulf without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
was aſſaulted by the <hi>Venetian</hi> Admiral, who ſunk divers of
their Veſſels, and forced the reſt to fly to <hi>Valona,</hi> and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged them, tho the City and Port were in the Dominion of the
<hi>Great Turk:</hi> yet tho a dangerous War was like to have enſued
hereon, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> rather than loſe their Dominion, inſiſted
on their Right, and concluded an honourable Peace with the <hi>Turk;</hi>
wherein it was agreed, <hi>That as often as any Turkiſh Veſſels did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Licence</hi> enter the Gulf, it ſhould be lawful for the <hi>Venetians</hi> to
ſeize upon them by force, if they would not otherwiſe obey, (ſee
the Juſtification of the ſecond <hi>Dutch</hi> War by K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. <hi>pag. 58)</hi>
and the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> prohibits all Nations, except his Vaſſals, to
enter the <hi>Euxine</hi> or <hi>Black Sea,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Red Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Stubbe,</hi> in his Juſtification of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's
<hi>Dutch</hi> War, <hi>pag.</hi> 126. ſays the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Norwegians</hi> would not
permit either <hi>Fleming</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> to fiſh near <hi>Schetland</hi> without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
previouſly obtained; and if any preſumed to fiſh without
Licence, they puniſhed them with Loſs of Life and Limb, and
were obliged to repair to <hi>Berghen,</hi> and pay their Duties into the
King's Exchequer there, as appears by the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Records, and
other Monuments preſerved in <hi>England:</hi> and this avowed to have
been practiſed conſantly time out of mind, <hi>Ann.</hi> 1432.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, upon the Marriage of <hi>James</hi> 3. of <hi>Scotland</hi> with
<hi>Margaret</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> 1. of <hi>Norway,</hi> the Rights of the
Fiſhery upon <hi>Schetland</hi> was transferred to the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> and
his Heirs, <hi>Anno</hi> 1470. and <hi>William Walwed,</hi> a <hi>Scots</hi> Lawyer, <hi>c. 3.
de Dominio Maris,</hi> ſays, That in the paſt Age, after a moſt bloody
Quarrel between the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> about the Fiſhery, the
Matter was at laſt compoſed in this manner.</p>
                  <p>That in time to come the <hi>Hollander</hi> ſhould keep at least eighty Miles
from the Coaſts of <hi>Scotland:</hi> And if by Accident they were driven
nearer by the Violence of the Weather, they paid a Tribute at the Port
of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> before their Return; where there was a Caſtle built and
fortified for this and other Occaſions.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Stubbe</hi> ſays, that <hi>Gerard Malinus,</hi> a moſt inquiſitive Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
informed him, That after the Agreement between the King of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60932:126"/>
                     <hi>Scotland</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould not fiſh within
eighty Miles of the <hi>Scots</hi> Coaſt, leſt the Shoals of Herrings ſhould
be interrupted; King <hi>James,</hi> before his coming to the Crown of
<hi>England,</hi> did let the Fiſhing upon the Coaſt of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> for 15 Years: And if this happen'd in the Year 1594,
when Prince <hi>Henry</hi> was born, then in the Year 1609, the Term
expired, when King <hi>James,</hi> by his Proclamation, enjoined the
<hi>Dutch</hi> which fiſhed upon the Coaſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to take Licences.
But certain it is, that the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to careſs King <hi>James</hi> the more,
at the Chriſtning of Prince <hi>Henry</hi> were his Godfathers, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
the Prince with 400 Ounces of fine Gold, and a Deed ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whereby the Prince was yearly to receive 5000 <hi>Florins</hi> out of
<hi>Camp-vere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Stubbe</hi> ſays, <hi>pag.</hi> 131, I believe from Authors truly cited
by him, The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> receives at his Ward-Houſe in the
<hi>Sound</hi> one Dollar for a Licence, and for the Seal, or Roſe, a Noble
of every Ship; and for every Laſt of Herrings (being 12 Barrels)
one Dollar. In <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> many Leagues from the <hi>Main</hi> (or Land)
the Fiſhermen pay great Taxes to the King; and in moſt places,
none but the Natives are permitted to fiſh; but where the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
are permitted to fiſh, they pay the tenth Fiſh to the Emperor.
The King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> amongſt the Regalities of that Crown, hath
that of the tenth Fiſh caught in his Seas; or if not that, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
for the Fiſhery: he has alſo ſeveral Diſtricts, Channels, or
Veins Royal in his Seas, which are appropriated to his particular
Uſe. Nor is there any Fiſhing permitted in the open Seas there,
but by Leave and Direction of the Governour of the neighbouring
Ports.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Page</hi> 132 he ſays, the ſame is practiſed by the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>
in the Kingdom of <hi>Algarsues,</hi> and the Natives pay a certain
Tribute for their Liberty to fiſh: And in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Sidonia</hi> does rent out of the Maritime Juriſdiction what he hath
in reference to Fiſhing, for 80000 Ducats of yearly Revenue.</p>
                  <p>Has not <hi>Grotius</hi> a fruitful Brain, to find out thoſe Uſages by
Princes and States, in all Ages, to be Uſurpation againſt natural
Right, which <hi>lib. 1. ſect. 10. tit. 5. de jure Belli &amp; Pacis,</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable
by God himſelf; and which never any Man before preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to queſtion? But before we enquire into the Cauſes from
which <hi>Grotius</hi> aſſumes to himſelf a Power, which he denies to be
in God Almighty, let's ſee how the Caſe ſtood with the <hi>Dutch</hi>
when <hi>Grotius</hi> wrote his <hi>Mare Liberum,</hi> both at home and abroad.</p>
                  <p>Tho the Seas were free, <hi>Jure naturali,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays, yet I
have ſeen a <hi>Dutch</hi> Placart, printed the Year before <hi>Grotius</hi> wrote
his <hi>Mare Liberum,</hi> viz. 1632, and which <hi>Grotius</hi> might have ſeen
as well as I, wherein the States preſcribe when and where the
<hi>Dutch</hi> ſhall begin and proceed in their Fiſheries; and wherein they
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60932:127"/>
forbid the Uſe of <hi>French</hi> Salt in all their Fiſheries; and that Salts
uſed in all of them ſhall be three times reviſed in three ſeveral
Offices, upon Penalty of Forfeiture of Fiſh and Salt: which, by
<hi>Grotius</hi>'s Doctrine, is an Uſurpation of the Natural Right which
every Man has in the Sea, and immutable by God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Stubbe,</hi> Page 132, ſays, That the Fiſhermen in one Year
paid the States 300000 <hi>l.</hi> for the Herrings and Codfiſh taken upon
the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> beſides the tenth Fiſh and
Cask, paid for Waftage, which comes at leaſt to as much more,
which are Duties proper to the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> So
that if what the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ever claimed by immemorial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
be an Uſurpation againſt natural Right, by <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
I would be willingly informed by any of <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Diſciples,
by what Right then do theſe new States impoſe theſe things upon
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who fiſh in theſe Seas.</p>
                  <p>If the Sea be free, <hi>Jure naturali,</hi> let any Man ſhew a Reaſon,
how the <hi>Dutch</hi> erect their <hi>East-India</hi> and <hi>West-India</hi> Companies
only to trade in the <hi>East-Indies, Africk</hi> and the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive
to the reſt of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> without a Violation of the natural
Right of the other <hi>Dutch,</hi> which <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays is immutable by
God.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Title, <hi>Mare Liberum,</hi> is abſurd, and contrary to the
Practice of his Country-men, ſo his <hi>Manifeſto</hi> of it is not leſs arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
and intolerable, viz. <hi>To the Princes and free People of the
Chriſtian World,</hi> without ſo much as the Addition of <hi>ſending greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
An Arrogance which no Pope ever aſſumed, yet done by
<hi>Grotius,</hi> an exotick and proſcribed Traitor, for raiſing Arms, and
endeavouring to ſubvert the eſtabliſh'd Church and State of his
native Country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Topick whereon he founds his</hi> Manifeſto <hi>is general, and
ſuch as no Thief or Rogue ever pleaded to ſave their Lives;</hi> viz.
It is an Error not leſs old than peſtilent, which many Mortals, but
thoſe eſpecially who most abound in Wealth, perſwade themſelves that
Juſt and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njust is not diſtinguiſhed by its own Nature, but by an empty
Opinion and Cuſtom of Men; and that all Right is to be meaſured by
the Will, and the Will by Profit.</p>
                  <p>But who theſe are who maintain theſe Opinions, <hi>Grotius</hi> names
none; if they were his Acquaintance (which I believe none of
the Kings or Free People were, except his Country-men were) he
ſhould have convinced them to their Faces, and not ſneakingly
have cavill'd at them behind their Backs. I ſay, I find this by no
Nation or People ſo much practiſed as by the <hi>Tripolins, Tunis, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier,</hi>
and <hi>Sally</hi>-men, and his Country-men, as will appear: And if
this will not oblige all Chriſtian Princes and Free People to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
all their Rights of Dominion to the Seas, whereof they have
been poſſeſſed by immemorial Preſcription, and leave all free for
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:60932:127"/>
the <hi>Dutch</hi> to do what they pleaſe in them, then <hi>Grotius</hi> is at a
Non-plus further to enforce it in his <hi>Manifeſto:</hi> If any Man can
find any thing elſe to do it, let him have it for his Pains, I'll not
envy him. But how hainouſly ſoever <hi>Grotius</hi> takes this old and
peſtilent Error, yet he allows it in himſelf, <hi>L. 1. C. 1. Sect. 10.
de Jure Belli &amp; Pacis,</hi> where he makes the Original of Human
Society and the Law of Nature to be from the Will of Man, and
to be immutable by God himſelf: But of this more ſhall be ſaid
hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Chapter of <hi>Grotius</hi> his <hi>Mare Liberum</hi> is, to ſhew, that
<hi>Jure Gentium,</hi> Navigation is free to all Men every where; and
therefore the <hi>Dutch</hi> may trade to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> tho the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguez</hi>
were Lords of the whole <hi>East-Indies;</hi> but much more it
would be unjuſt in the <hi>Portuguez</hi> to exclude the <hi>Dutch</hi> from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with thoſe People there who have no Dependance upon the
<hi>Portuguez,</hi> and are willing to entertain Trade and Commerce with
the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> He who accuſes another of any Crime, had need take care
he be not guilty of the ſame himſelf; and if it be ſo old and peſtilent a
Crime in Princes and States to claim a Dominion in the Sea, tho en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
by Immemorial Preſcription, <hi>Grotius</hi> ſhould have done well to
have ſhewed how his Country-men (the beginning of whoſe States was
in the Memory of thouſands then alive) ſhould arrogate to themſelves
to be Commanders of all the Seas in the World, Protectors of all the
Kings and Princes in <hi>Europe,</hi> and Supream Moderators of all the
Affairs of all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> as you may read in <hi>William de Britaine</hi>
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, <hi>pag.</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſo old and peſtilent an Error in the King of <hi>England</hi> to
claim an Acknowledgment of Submiſſion of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> for the Kings
protecting them in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas; how much more peſtilent an
Error was it for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> Anno 1620, without any Provocation of
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and in time of Peace, to ſeize the <hi>Bear</hi> and <hi>Star,</hi> two
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, in the <hi>Straits</hi> of <hi>Mallaca,</hi> going to <hi>China,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated
Ships and Goods valued at 150000 <hi>l.?</hi> See <hi>William de
Britaine,</hi> pag. 18. So that it is by <hi>Grotius</hi> his Doctrine an old and
peſtilent Error in the King of <hi>England,</hi> to protect all Nations in
the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas from Piracy and Violence, and free to the <hi>Dutch</hi> to
be Pirates in the <hi>Indian Seas</hi> by a Grant from <hi>Hugo Grotius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Seas be free, <hi>Jure Gentium,</hi> for all Nations to trade with
one the other, How then came it to paſs, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> excluded all
Nations from trading to <hi>Amboyna</hi> and <hi>Polloroon</hi> for Spice, to which
they had no Title, but by forcing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from them in times of
Peace, and when they received no Injury from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> &amp;c. to ſay
no worſe?</p>
                  <p>And if it be ſo much more injurious for the <hi>Portuguez</hi> to hinder
the <hi>Dutch</hi> from trading to thoſe Kingdoms and People in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi>

<hi>Lillo</hi> upon the <hi>Scheld,</hi> to hinder the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and all other Nations from
trading to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and other Places in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Netherlands,
which have no Dependance upon the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here give me leave to obſerve, (tho after <hi>Grotius</hi> wrote his
<hi>Mare Liberum)</hi> That in the <hi>Marine</hi> Treaty made by King <hi>Charles</hi>
the Second, <hi>Anno</hi> 1674, it was agreed by the firſt Article, that
the Subjects of the King ſhould with all Freedom and Safety ſail
and trade in all thoſe Kingdoms and Countries in Peace, Amity or
Neutrality with the King, and not be hindred or moleſted by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Force, or Ships of War of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> upon any occaſion of
Hoſtility or Difference which now is or hereafter ſhall be; yet
this Treaty was ſcarce concluded, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships trading
to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> were ſtopt by a <hi>Dutch</hi> Man of War riding before the
Fort <hi>Lillo,</hi> and forced to go back to <hi>Fluſhing</hi> or <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and
there conſtrained to unlade their Veſſels and pay their Cuſtoms,
and lade their Goods in <hi>Dutch</hi> Bottoms, and to pay ſuch Fraights
as the <hi>Dutch</hi> pleaſed to impoſe upon them, and this Uſage not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
this Treaty is ſtill continued. I think a like Inſtance
cannot be given, that ever any King of <hi>England</hi> ſerved the <hi>Dutch</hi>
or any other Nation ſo trading in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas.</p>
                  <p>I do agree with <hi>Grotius,</hi> that God hath ſo diſpoſed this our
Habitable Globe, that ſome Places abound with things convenient
and neceſſary for Human Uſe, which the People of other Places
want; and that for the Entertainment of mutual Society and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
in all the habitable Places of the World, Acceſſion may be
had by Water, which cannot be done by Land; but this cannot
be done in a State of Anarchy, or where Men live out of Society;
which tho <hi>Grotius</hi> would have the Dominion of the Sea to be,
yet he gives not one Inſtance of it, nor how it can poſſibly be:
but more of this when we examine <hi>Grotius</hi> his Original of Human
Society in his Treatiſe, <hi>De Jure Belli &amp; Pacis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond Chapter of <hi>Grotius</hi> his <hi>Mare Liberum</hi> is, that the
<hi>Portuguez</hi> have not right of Dominion to thoſe <hi>Indies</hi> to which
the <hi>Dutch</hi> trade, by the Title of Invention, or firſt finding them
out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They have as good a Title as the <hi>Dutch</hi> have to their
new <hi>Batavia,</hi> which they filcht from the Natives; or to <hi>Amboyna,
Polloroon,</hi> the Iſlands of <hi>Seran, Nero, Waire, Baſingen, Latro, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bello,
Nitto, Larica</hi> and <hi>Lantare,</hi> which they filcht from the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
then at Peace and Amity with them.</p>
                  <p>The third Chapter is, the <hi>Portuguez</hi> have no right of Dominion
to the <hi>Indies</hi> by the Donation of the Pope.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet this Title is better than the <hi>Dutch</hi> have, who have
no Donation but by their own Will and Uſurpation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:60932:129"/>
The fourth Chapter is, the <hi>Portuguez</hi> have no right of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
againſt the <hi>Indians</hi> by the Title of War.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> As much as the <hi>Dutch</hi> have; nor did they ever practiſe
ſuch Barbarities againſt the Natives and other Nations trading to
the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> as the <hi>Dutch</hi> have done and yet do.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Chapter is, that the right of navigating to the <hi>Indies,</hi>
is not proper to the <hi>Portuguez</hi> by the Title of Occupation; and
here <hi>Grotius</hi> tells you abundance of Fictions of Poets, and Tales
of popular Orators, which may ſerve better for Ballads, than Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of a Diſcourſe of this Nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Portuguez</hi> Title herein is better than the <hi>Dutch,</hi> for
they were Occupatants long before the <hi>Dutch</hi> were, or their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was form'd into States.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth Chapter is the ſame with the third, and needs no
other Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh Chapter (tho in the Print the third) is, that the
right of Navigation is not proper to the <hi>Portuguez</hi> by the Title of
Preſcription or Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> As <hi>Grotius</hi> puts the Caſe at large, I do not find nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the <hi>Portuguez</hi> ever claimed or pretended to any ſuch Cuſtom
or Preſcription; ſo this is a Bag of Clouts of <hi>Grotius</hi> his own ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up, and he might have ſaved himſelf the labour of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Stones at it.</p>
                  <p>The eighth Chapter is, that <hi>Jure Gentium,</hi> Trade is free with
all Men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, but this is in eſtabliſhed Governments, and not in
a State of Anarchy, and where Men live out of Society, as <hi>Grotius</hi>
drives at.</p>
                  <p>In the ninth Chapter, <hi>Grotius</hi> chews the Cud upon what he ſaid
Chapter the fifth, and needs no other Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>The tenth is the ſame with the third Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The eleventh Chapter is, that the Trade with the <hi>Indians</hi> is not
proper to the <hi>Portuguez</hi> by right of Preſcription or Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Chapter is more reſtrained than the ſeventh, yet it
is ſo large, if you take the <hi>Indies,</hi> as our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company
does, from <hi>Cape Bon Speranza</hi> to the North of <hi>China,</hi> including
the Eaſt of <hi>Africk,</hi> and both ſides of the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi>
Gulph, and the Iſlands which lie between the <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>Good-Hope</hi>
and the North of <hi>China,</hi> it is more than half the Circumference
of the Globe of the Earth: But this is another Bag of Clouts of
<hi>Grotius</hi>'s ſetting up, for I do not believe or find the <hi>Portuguez</hi> ever
made any ſuch Claim, or if they did, it would have been impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to have maintained it.</p>
                  <p>The twelfth Chapter is, that the <hi>Portuguez</hi> endeavour by no
Equity to forbid Trade, <hi>which if they do, I do agree with</hi> Grotius.
Theſe Premiſes thus learnedly eſtabliſhed, you need not doubt but
that</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:60932:130"/>
The thirteenth Chapter is, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> have a Right of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
Commerce to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> as well in Peace and in
making Truces, as in War.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> I have heard a Story of the <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary,</hi> that after he
has din'd, he gives leave by ſound of Trumpet to all the other
Princes and Potentates in the World to go to Dinner: ſo <hi>Grotius</hi>
after he had bound up all Nations at Land by his Civil Compact in
his <hi>Jus Belli &amp; Pacis,</hi> in his <hi>Mare Liberum</hi> gives the <hi>Dutch</hi> Liberty
to do what they pleaſe at Sea, by a Grant from <hi>Hugo Grotius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I have often wondred what ſhould engage <hi>Grotius</hi> to write
this Treatiſe of <hi>Mare Liberum</hi> in favour of his Country-men; for
at this time he was a proſcribed Traitor by them, and if you'll
take his Word, in the Dedication of his <hi>Jus Belli &amp; Pacis</hi> to
<hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>13th,</hi> he was ill uſed by them, unleſs it were as <hi>Caius
Marius</hi> did, after he was proſcribed by the Senate to be an Enemy
to <hi>Rome,</hi> refuſed to enter <hi>Rome</hi> till his Proſcription was revoked
by the Senate, which when they met to do, <hi>Marius</hi> entred <hi>Rome</hi>
and maſſacred them; ſo <hi>Grotius</hi> hoped by this Treatiſe to have his
Proſcription reverſed, and that he might return home again to ſet
his Countrey-men at Land together by the Ears, and in Tumults, as
he endeavoured to have done before.</p>
                  <p>And if it be true which <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays, <hi>Lib. 2. cap. 2. de Jure
Belli &amp; Pacis,</hi> that before the Civil Pact all things at Land were
in common; and that no Man had Right to any thing, but that
another by the ſame Right might take it from him, and that the
Civil Pact was never of the Sea: Whether this does not juſtify
all Pirates and Robbers at Sea in all their Depredations and Piracies?
But becauſe we ſee but by halves here, we will hereafter examine
his Civil Pact, and ſee how Men by his Reaſons come to be bound
up by Land and looſe at Sea, which neither Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> nor any
other that I have ſeen who wrote againſt <hi>Mare Liberum</hi> have done.
But if it be ſo old and peſtilent an Error in all other Chriſtian
Kings and States, to aſſert their Rights and Dominion upon the
Seas, <hi>Grotius,</hi> if he had had any Ingenuity, ſhould have admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
his Country-men to have avoided this old and peſtilent Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
before he charged all other Chriſtian Princes and States with
it, but of this he ſays not one word.</p>
                  <p>But to return; <hi>Noy,</hi> how zealous ſoever he was againſt granting
the King Tunnage and Poundage, he muſt now find a way how the
King may raiſe Ship-money, beſides Tunnage and Poundage not
granted by Parliament, nor Ship-money neither: The Ground-work
was, that the King was in great danger by Pirates, and the
King ſole Judg of the Danger: He had finiſhed the Work, but
liv'd not to ſee it put in Execution, for he died the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,
1634,</hi> to the great regret of the Arch-biſhop.</p>

In <hi>September</hi> following Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> died, but upon his
Death-bed Sir <hi>Francis Windebank, Laud</hi>'s old Friend, by an Order
of Council came to ſearch for ſeditious and dangerous Papers,
by virtue whereof he took Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>'s Comment upon <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton,</hi>
and the Hiſtory of his Life before it, written with his
own Hand, his Comment upon <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> &amp;c. the Pleas of
the Crown, and Juriſdiction of Courts, and his <hi>11th</hi> and <hi>12th</hi>
Reports in Manuſcript, and I think 51 other Manuſcripts, with
the laſt Will of Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> wherein he had for ſeveral Years
been making Proviſions for his younger Grand-Children: the
Books and Papers were kept till ſeven Years after, when one of
Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s Sons in 1641, moved the Houſe of Commons, that
the Books and Papers taken by Sir <hi>Francis Windebank</hi> might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to Sir <hi>Robert Coke,</hi> Heir of Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> which the King
was pleaſed to grant, and ſuch as could be found were delivered;
but Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s Will was never heard more of to this day.</p>
                  <p>I do not find that the Arch-biſhop was the firſt Mover of this,
nor do I find the like was ever done before the Arch-biſhop was
Primier Miniſter of State; yet this I find, that <hi>Windebank</hi> was
found to be one of the Fomenters for carrying on the Popiſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
with <hi>Con</hi> Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s Chaplain, in the Year 1640.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edward</hi> is removed by Death in <hi>September,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert
Heath</hi> in <hi>October</hi> is removed from being Chief Juſtice of the
Common-Pleas, to make room for Sir <hi>John Finch,</hi> as <hi>Heath</hi> before
had been made Chief Juſtice to make room for <hi>Noy</hi> to be Attorney-General:
You need not fear but that Sir <hi>John Finch</hi> (now a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite
of the King and Queen and Arch-biſhop) who could put
no Queſtion when he was Speaker, ſhall without Queſtion judg
Ship-money to be lawful, whatever <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or <hi>Petition of
Right</hi> ſays to the contrary: Nor ſhall he ſtay here, but be the
prime Agent in breaking through the Bounds of <hi>Charta de Foreſta,</hi>
by enlarging the Limits of the Foreſts, ſo as no Man, if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in 1641 had not prevented it, could tell where it would
have ſtopped. But this was not all the Reaſon why <hi>Heath</hi> was
turn'd out and <hi>Finch</hi> put in, it was <hi>Kilvert</hi>'s Pleaſure, one of <hi>Laud</hi>'s
Inſtruments, to ruin his Patron the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> as you may
ſee in the ſecond Part of his Life, <hi>fol. 118. tit.</hi> 113. and it exceeds

<hi>Windebank,</hi> conſpired the Ruin of the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> if ſo
grave an Author as the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield</hi> had not reported it in
the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s Life. See the ſecond Part, <hi>fol.</hi> 138.</p>
                  <p>The Writs for Ship-Money are now iſſued out; the Proceedings
againſt the Officers for not collecting the Aſſeſſments, as Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
Bayliffs, and other Officers, were to bind them over to anſwer
at the Council-board, and Commitment, if any refuſed to give
Bond; but if Sheriffs neglect to collect all ſuch Aſſeſſments in their
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:60932:131"/>
Year, they ſhall ſtand charged with the Arrears. Thus things at
preſent ſtood, but the breaking the Bounds of the Foreſts was
but in <hi>Embrio,</hi> yet in a hopeful Production.</p>
                  <p>Thus things ſtood in the State about the end of the Year 1634.
In the Church the Arch-Biſhop had the ſole Supremacy, not only
in <hi>England,</hi> but in <hi>Scotland,</hi> having got a Warrant from the King
to hold Correſpondence with the Biſhops; and alſo in <hi>Ireland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
choſen Chancellor of the Univerſity of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and having got
Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> to be Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who was now
as much his intimate Confident as <hi>Noy</hi> was before.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>England,</hi> the Arch-biſhop's Injunctions for wearing the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice,
receiving the Sacrament kneeling, and placing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Table
Altar-ways, and railing it about, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
proſecuted, with the opprobrious Names of <hi>Puritan</hi> and
<hi>Schiſmatick</hi> fixed upon <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> with Deprivations and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
upon Lecturers and Chaplains who refuſed to come up to
them; if they did, they muſt forſake their Patrons, Patroneſſes and
Flocks who provided them Bread, ſo that they contended <hi>pro Aris
&amp; Focis,</hi> and otherways no Proviſion was made for them. On the
contrary, they retorted on the Biſhops and promoted Clergy with
bitter Terms of Popiſhly affected, and Rags of <hi>Superſtition</hi> and
<hi>Idolatry;</hi> ſo that the Contentions all over the Kingdom were as
fierce as in the Univerſities.</p>
                  <p>But it had been happy for this Nation, if the Effects of theſe
Contentions had been terminated in the Bounds of it: For the
Arch-biſhop in his Metropolitan Viſitation this Year 1634, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
the Miniſters of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Churches to appear
before his Vicar-General, where all the Natives, <hi>viz.</hi> born in
<hi>England,</hi> were enjoined to repair to their ſeveral Pariſh-Churches
to hear Divine Service and Sermons, and perform all Duties and
Payments required in that behalf.</p>
                  <p>The Deſcendants of thoſe <hi>Walloons</hi> perſecuted by <hi>Alva,</hi> and of
the <hi>French</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> II. of <hi>France,</hi> had for near ninety Years been
allowed their ſeveral Congregations by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King
<hi>James</hi> I, and had the Royal Word of King <hi>Charles</hi> for enjoying
of them: But now at once they muſt be turn'd out of them.</p>
                  <p>When theſe Injunctions were to be put in Execution at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Congregations petitioned Dr. <hi>Matthew
Wren,</hi> that theſe Injunctions might not be impoſed upon them; but
finding no Relief, appealed to the Arch-biſhop, who return'd a
ſharp Anſwer, that unleſs they would ſubmit, he would proceed
againſt them according to the Laws and Canons Eccleſiaſtical.</p>
                  <p>Here take notice, that as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade was the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
Trade to this Nation; ſo the Trade to <hi>Hamburg,</hi> and the
Countries and Kingdoms within the <hi>Sound</hi> with our Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
was the beſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had for Employment of People
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:60932:131"/>
Shipping and Navigation: The Company which traded into the
<hi>Sound,</hi> was called the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-Country Company, and Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
and after her King <hi>James,</hi> to honour them, called it the
Royal Company.</p>
                  <p>This Trade the <hi>Engliſh</hi> enjoyed time out of mind; and the
Cloths which ſupplied it, were principally made in <hi>Suffolk</hi> and
<hi>Yorkſhire:</hi> And <hi>Ipſwich</hi> as it was the fineſt Town in <hi>England,</hi>
and had the Nobleſt Harbour on the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and moſt convenient
for the Trade of the <hi>Northern</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Parts of the World, ſo
till this time it was in as flouriſhing a State as any other in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> ſtraining theſe Injunctions to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
frighted thouſands of Families out of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi>
into <hi>New-England;</hi> and about 140 Families of the Workers of
thoſe Woollen Manufactures, wherewith <hi>Hamburg</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
within the <hi>Sound</hi> were ſupplied, went into <hi>Holland;</hi> where
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as wiſe as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was in entertaining the
<hi>Walloons</hi> perſecuted by the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> eſtabliſhed theſe <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Exciſe-free, and Houſe-Rent free for ſeven Years; and from
theſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> became inſtructed in working theſe Manufactures,
which before they knew not: The Conſequence whereof ſhall be
ſhewn hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But the Care of the Arch-biſhop for Reformation of the
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was not leſs than for that of <hi>England;</hi> and to
that end got the King to ſign a Common-Prayer Book for the Uſe
of the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and gave order to the Biſhops there,
to compile certain Canons for the Government of the Church,
and there to be impoſed by Regal and Epiſcopal Authority; and
to this end <hi>Laud</hi> held Correſpondence with the Arch-biſhop of
Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> and other Biſhops of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe things were brewing in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> you
need not fear <hi>Ireland,</hi> now Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> was Lieutenant
there: a moſt dreadful War overſpread <hi>Germany;</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi>
the <hi>4th,</hi> a weak laſcivious Prince, reigned in <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo as <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi>
had a fair Opportunity to ſubdue <hi>Monſieur</hi> the King's Brother,
and overthrow the Forces raiſed by the Duke of <hi>Momerancy,</hi>
to aſſiſt <hi>Monſieur;</hi> wherein the Duke was unhappily taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and had his Head cut off, being a young Prince of greateſt
Hope, the moſt antient of the French Nobility, and the laſt of his
Line.</p>
                  <p>But the Cardinal did not reſt here, but built more and better
Men of War than had been before in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> ſhall firſt

their Fleet with the <hi>French,</hi> in relieving St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the Iſle of

the <hi>Spaniards</hi> intending to relieve by Sea, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred

Ships, whereof ſix of them were richly laden for the <hi>Indies,</hi> and
burnt two Gallions upon the Stocks, and ſix others entirely fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed:
In the Ships taken, beſides their Equippage, and other
Ammunition of War, the <hi>French</hi> took an incredible Number of
Cannons, 100 whereof were Braſs, with the Arms of the Houſe of

                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>England,</hi> this Year 1635, there was great Contrivance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Arch-biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and Biſhops of <hi>Scotland,</hi> how to
erect a <hi>High Commiſſion</hi> Court in <hi>Scotland</hi> by the King's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
without Conſent in Parliament, for proceeding againſt ſuch
as would not ſubmit to the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> Book, and Canons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
by the King, and Biſhops of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and upon the <hi>28th</hi>
of <hi>February,</hi> the Arch-biſhop conſecrated Dr. <hi>Manwaring</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> a worthy Succeſſor to ſo Saint-like and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a Predeceſſor; for this Biſhoprick was <hi>Laud</hi>'s firſt Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>You have ſeen his Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Temper towards the
King's Subjects; now ſee how it was towards the King. His Grace
being as high as <hi>England</hi> could admit, <hi>viz.</hi> Metropolitan, and firſt
Peer thereof, would viſit both Univerſities by his Metropolitan
Right, and not by Commiſſion from the King, and ſignified ſo
much to both; to which both anſwered, <hi>That to admit it without
a Warrant from the King, was a Wrong to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities;</hi> his Grace
was Chancellour of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> of <hi>Cambridg.</hi>
The Cauſe came to a hearing before the King and Council, the
<hi>21ſt</hi> of <hi>June, 1634;</hi> where the Attorney General <hi>Banks</hi> was for
his Grace againſt the King, Mr. <hi>Gardener,</hi> the Recorder of <hi>London,</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or <hi>Cambridg,</hi> and Serjeant <hi>Thyn</hi> for <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Cauſe was ſhortly
this.</p>
                  <p>Both ſides agreed in this, that both Univerſities were of the
King's Foundation, and ſo might be viſited, as they had often
been, by Commiſſion from the King: But this would not do
with his Grace, he would, to uſe his own Words, <hi>viſit by his own
Right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:60932:132"/>
Serjeant <hi>Thyn</hi> urged againſt this, the King's Foundation of the
Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and that never any Arch-biſhop ſo viſited:
But the Recorder could not ſay ſo of <hi>Cambridg;</hi> which happened
upon this Occaſion. In the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>2d Wickliff</hi>'s
Doctrine prevailed much in both Univerſities; and <hi>Arundel,</hi> then
Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> (as zealous to ſuppreſs the <hi>Wickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
as <hi>Laud</hi> was the <hi>Puritans)</hi> to ſuppreſs them did viſit <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
Metropolitano;</hi> but <hi>Oxford</hi> oppoſed him <hi>forti Manu:</hi> Upon this
<hi>Arundel</hi> appeals to the King, who being a weak Prince, and as
zealous for the then Church, as King <hi>Charles</hi> was for <hi>Laud</hi>'s,
declares the Right to be in the Biſhop; ſo did <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> the
Current running againſt <hi>Wickliff,</hi> which was after confirmed in
Parliament; but <hi>Cambridg</hi> was not in it: Yet never before did
any Arch-biſhop viſit <hi>Oxford,</hi> nor <hi>Cambridg,</hi> ſince the Year 1404,
<hi>Jure Metropolitano,</hi> as his Grace would do; and ſo the Cauſe
went for the Arch-biſhop.</p>
                  <p>Plum'd thus in his own Feathers, all black and white, without
one borrowed from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> whereby the more he aſſumes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
the leſs he leaves the King, he now ſoars higher; the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in their own Names, enjoin
the Removal of the Communion Table in the Pariſh-Churches and
Univerſities, from the Body of the Church or Chancel, to the
Eaſt of the Chancel, and cauſe Rails to be ſet about the Table,
and refuſe to adminiſter the Sacrament to ſuch as ſhall not come
up to the Rails, and receive it kneeling; that the Book of Sports
on <hi>Sundays</hi> be read in Churches; and enjoin Adoration.</p>
                  <p>I do not find that Adoration was ever enjoined before, nor any
of the fore-named Injunctions in any Canon of the Church; ſure
I am, they were never publickly put in Execution: ſo that
whether theſe were any of the Canons of the Church or not, was
not underſtood by one of 10000; and the Lecturers, Chaplains and
School-maſters, who had no Maintenance from the Church, being
principally ſtruck at by theſe Injunctions, make all the ſiniſter
and worſt Conſtructions they could invent againſt them; ſo that
though thoſe Injunctions had been founded in the Canons of the
Church, yet the contrary was believed, and ſo had the ſame Effect
as if they had not been founded in the Church-Canons.</p>
                  <p>Here I cannot omit one Paſſage; That ſeveral were deprived
by the Biſhop's Authority, for refuſing to read the Book of
Sports on <hi>Sunday:</hi> Whereas King <hi>James</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> allowed the ſeven
Biſhops a legal Trial for refuſing to enjoin the Clergy to read
his Declaration for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and the Biſhops were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted.</p>
                  <p>That the Legality of theſe Proceedings might be manifeſt, a
Proclamation was iſſued out, that it was the Opinion of the
Judges, that the Act of the 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. 2. which ordains that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:60932:133"/>
ſhould hold their Eccleſiaſtical Courts in the King's Name,
or by Commiſſion from him, was repealed by the <hi>1ſt</hi> of Queen
<hi>Mary;</hi> though this Act was repealed by the 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> 25. and ſo
the Act 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. 2. was revived, and ſo reſolved upon a full
Debate in Parliament 7 <hi>Jacobi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Thunder of thoſe Canons, the terrible and unheard of
Execution of them in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> againſt all Oppoſers, by
Speech or Writing, ſo terrified the <hi>Puritans</hi> which would not
ſubmit, that incredible Numbers of them left the Kingdom, to
inhabit in foreign <hi>Plantations,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>New-England,</hi> where
theſe Eccleſiaſtical Canons could not well play upon them. But to
reſtrain the further Evaſion of them, the King by Proclamation,
the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1638, ſtops all the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> to keep
them in it: The Reaſon was, no doubt, that they might be better
inſtructed in the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
here, than elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>But Ship-Money, notwithſtanding my Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry</hi>'s
Charge to the Judges laſt Year, that in their Circuits they ſhould
give Charge how juſtly the King required Ship-Money for the
common Defence, and with what Alacrity and Chearfulneſs they
(the Subjects) are bound in Duty to contribute; yet this did not
paſs-for true Doctrine with all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> upon Advice with
<hi>Holborn, St. John,</hi> and <hi>Whitlock,</hi> denied the Payment, whereupon
ſeveral other Gentlemen refuſed alſo.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the King was adviſed by the Lord Chief Juſtice
<hi>Finch</hi> to require the Opinion of his Judges, which he did in a
Letter to them; and after much Solicitation by the Chief Juſtice,
promiſing Preferment to ſome, and highly threatning others whom
he found doubting, he got from them in Anſwer to the King's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Caſe, their Opinion in theſe Words.</p>
                  <p>We are of Opinion, that when the Good and Safety of the Kingdom
in general is concerned, and the whole Kingdom in danger, you may
by your Writ under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> command all your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of this your Kingdom, at their Charge, to provide and furniſh
ſuch number of Ships, with Men, Victuals and Ammunition, and for
ſuch time as your Majeſty ſhall think fit, for the Defence and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
of the Kingdom from Peril and Danger. And that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
may compel the doing thereof in caſe of Refuſal or Refractorineſs.
And we are alſo of Opinion, that in ſuch Caſe your Majeſty is ſole
Judg, both of the Danger, and when, and how the ſame is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
and avoided.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This Opinion was ſigned by</hi> Davenport, Denham, Hutton, Croke,
Trevor, Bramſton, Finch, Vernon, Berkly, Crawley, <hi>and</hi> Weſton. <hi>See</hi>
Whitlock'<hi>s Memoirs,</hi> f. 24.</p>
                  <p>The King having previouſly extorted the Judges Opinions <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte,</hi>
gave order for the Proceedings againſt Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> in the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60932:133"/>
Exchequer, where he pleaded; and the King's Counſel demurring,
the Point in Law came to be argued on both ſides. Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi>
has a remarkable Paſſage of Judg <hi>Croke,</hi> concerning his Opinion
in the Caſe, of which he ſpeaks knowingly, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Judg
was reſolved to give his Judgment for the King, and to that end
had prepared his Argument; yet a few Days before he was to
argue, upon ſome Diſcourſe with ſome of his neareſt Relations,
and moſt ſerious Thoughts of the Buſineſs, and being heartned
thereto by his Lady, who was a good and pious Woman, told her
Husband upon this Occaſion, <hi>That ſhe hoped he would do nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his Conſcience, for fear of any Danger or Prejudice to him or his
Family; and that ſhe was content to ſuffer Want, or any Miſery with
him, rather than be an Occaſion for him to do or ſay any thing againſt
his Conſcience or Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon theſe and many the like Incouragements, but chiefly upon
better thoughts, he ſuddenly altered his Purpoſe and Arguments,
and when it came to his turn, contrary to Expectation, he argued
and declared his Opinion againſt the King; and ſo did Judg <hi>Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
after; however the reſt of the Judges gave their Opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Mr. <hi>Hambden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However the King this Year, to ſweeten the Judges Opinion for
levying Ship-Money, ſet out a Navy of ſixty Men of War to
diſturb the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fiſhing on the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi>
under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who ſeized
and ſunk ſeveral of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Buſſes; whereupon they ſued to
the King for leave to fiſh, promiſing to pay an Acknowledgment
of 30000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> But this ill agreed with the King's Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for levying Ship-Money, which was, that Pirats infeſted our
Coaſts to the indangering the Safety of the Nation. See <hi>William
de Britaine, f.</hi> 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>But if the <hi>Dutch</hi> were thus bold upon our Coaſts, by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
granted them by <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> they were much bolder in the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> where they ſtile themſelves Soveraigns of all the Seas
in the World; for <hi>Anno</hi> 1620, they ſeized upon two Ships of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> called the <hi>Bear</hi> and the <hi>Star,</hi> in the Straits of <hi>Mallaca,</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>China,</hi> and confiſcated Ships and Goods valued at 150000 <hi>l.</hi>
I ſuppoſe <hi>Grotius</hi> could not give a like Inſtance of any <hi>Dutch</hi>
Ships ſo uſed for paſſing through the Channel; and laſt Year, <hi>viz.
1635,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship called the <hi>Bona Eſperanza</hi> going towards
<hi>China</hi> by the Straits of <hi>Mallaca,</hi> was violently aſſaulted by three
<hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War, the Maſter and many of the Men killed, and
the Ship brought into <hi>Mallaca,</hi> and there the Ship and Goods
were confiſcate valued at 150000 <hi>l.</hi> and this very Year the <hi>Dragon</hi>
and <hi>Katherine</hi> two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships of Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> valued at
300000 <hi>l.</hi> beſides the Commanders and others, who had great
Eſtates in them, were ſet upon by ſeven <hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War, as
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60932:134"/>
they paſt the Straits of <hi>Mallaca</hi> from <hi>China,</hi> and by them taken,
the Men tied back to back, and thrown over-board, the Goods ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of the Ships, which were ſunk, and ſeized for the State.</p>
                  <p>The State and Church of <hi>England</hi> thus eſtabliſhed in Doctrine
and Diſcipline, the Arch-biſhop's next Care was, to have the ſame
in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and herein he was ſo abſolute, that the King told the
Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> when he was his Commiſſioner in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that
the Arch-biſhop was the only <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> he entruſted in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Affairs in <hi>Scotland:</hi> and no Care need be had of the
Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſince my Lord Viſcount <hi>Wentworth</hi> was Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
there, who, to all Intents, purſued the Arch-biſhop's Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
Here let's ſee how the Church ſtood in <hi>Scotland,</hi> before
the Arch-biſhop undertook to reform it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>James</hi> the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> died the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> 1542,
leaving only one Daughter, <hi>Mary,</hi> but five Days old, by <hi>Mary</hi>
of <hi>Lorain</hi> his Wife, Siſter to <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi>
Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> two the moſt powerful Princes in <hi>France,</hi> after
King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> and the moſt zealouſly addicted to the <hi>Popiſh
Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the King's Death, Cardinal <hi>Beaton</hi> got a Prieſt <hi>(Henry
Balfour)</hi> to forge the King's Will, whereby the Cardinal, the
Earls of <hi>Huntley, Argile</hi> and <hi>Murray,</hi> were to have the Government
during the Queen's Minority; but the Nobility not believing it,
choſe the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> Governour; and <hi>Henry,</hi> the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
deſiring to unite the Kingdoms, by marrying his Son <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
with the Infant-Queen, ſent a ſolemn Embaſſy to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Council of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to conſent to this Marriage, which
was done, only the Queen <hi>Dowager,</hi> and the Cardinal diſſenting;
and this was confirm'd by the Parliament convened at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> following: Yet the Queen-Mother and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
got the Queen to be married to <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> Son of
<hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Parliament the <hi>Scots</hi> were permitted to read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, till the Prelates ſhould publiſh one
more correct. But in the Year 1559, the <hi>Scots</hi> began their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
in Religion at <hi>Perth:</hi> the intervening Accidents of the
<hi>Scots</hi> Endeavours to reform, and the Oppoſition by the Regent,
the Cardinal, and the Prelates, you may read in Biſhop <hi>Spotſwood</hi>'s
Hiſtory of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Sir <hi>James Melvil</hi>'s Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs.</p>
                  <p>To ſuppreſs the Progreſs of this Reformation, the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who was Regent, calls in an Army and Navy of <hi>French</hi> to
oppoſe them: The Reformers call in an Army and Navy of <hi>Engliſh;</hi>
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet fire the <hi>French</hi> Ships in their Harbour, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
the <hi>French</hi> to leave <hi>Scotland;</hi> and in 1560, the Queen Regent
died, leaving <hi>Scotland</hi> in a kind of <hi>Interregnum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:60932:134"/>
In <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, a Parliament convened at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> by a
Warrant from the King and Queen, wherein the <hi>Maſs</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi>
were ſuppreſſed, and the Reformation of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> in
Doctrine and Diſcipline eſtabliſhed; but the King and Queen, now
of <hi>France</hi> as well as <hi>Scotland,</hi> refuſed to confirm either; nor was
this Kirk-Doctrine and Diſcipline confirmed till the Queen was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
and <hi>Murray</hi> made Regent in 1567.</p>
                  <p>The Reformation was purely after the Mode of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and
Church of <hi>Geneva;</hi> a <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> was ordained, not ſtrictly to
be obſerved, but as a Pattern of Prayer: In it were ordained four
ſorts of Aſſemblies, <hi>viz.</hi> National, Provincial, Weekly Meetings
of Miniſters, and the Elderſhip of every Pariſh.</p>
                  <p>Superintendents were likewiſe eſtabliſhed, whoſe Office was to
viſit the Kirk within limited Places; theſe had Power to cite and
deprive Miniſters, but muſt be aſſiſted by ſome grave Miniſters
next adjoining, as alſo to ordain Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>But the Hierarchy of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as they were
eſteemed one of the States in Parliament, was not then, nor after
taken away by Parliament, nor their Power of Ordination and
Viſiting within their Dioceſſes; yet in Viſitation and Ordination
the Superintendents had a concurring Power with the Biſhops,
and the Biſhops were ſubject to be cited and proceeded againſt
for Scandal, neglect of their Office, Symony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the General
Aſſemblies.</p>
                  <p>This Reformation, <hi>viz.</hi> 1581, was ſubſcribed by King <hi>James</hi>
and all the Houſhold, and afterward King <hi>Charles</hi> in 1633, being
crowned at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where the Form ordained by the King was
obſerved, and the King ſwore to obſerve the Reformation as it then
ſtood: But ſome Alterations were made by King <hi>James</hi> in 1610,
and by the five Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> in favour of the Biſhops, and
more conformable to the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>King <hi>James,</hi> who loved the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> no better
than the <hi>Puritans</hi> in <hi>England, Anno</hi> 1610, called a General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

Aſſembly at <hi>Perth,</hi> 1618, which were agreed to by a Parliament
convened at <hi>Edinburg,</hi> 1621.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Church ſtood in <hi>Scotland</hi> when the Arch-biſhop <hi>Laud</hi>
would make it conformable in all Points to that he was now eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
in <hi>England.</hi> The firſt Step he moved herein, was by
preferring the Biſhops in <hi>Scotland</hi> in almoſt all Preferments before
the Nobility; ſo that of thirteen, nine were Privy-Counſellors, and
<hi>Spotſwood,</hi> Arch-biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> was Chancellor, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were of the Exchequer; and <hi>Maxwell,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Roſs,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with the Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi> to be Lord-Treaſurer; and were
Sticklers to have Tithes, and Impropriations, and the Abbots Lands
to be reſtored to the Church; and the Weekly Meetings of the
Miniſters are termed Conventicles by the Biſhops. Tho the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> were <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> yet all Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and Encouragement by the Biſhops were given to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenets: So that the Brawls and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:60932:135"/>
about them were as high in the Univerſity of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi>
as in <hi>Cambridg</hi> and <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There had not been one General Aſſembly ſince that of <hi>Perth
1618,</hi> when in 1637 the Common-Prayer, Canons, and High-Commiſſion
were impoſed by the King's and Biſhop's Authority;
and beſides the High-Commiſſion, the Biſhops had Warrants from
the King, to grant Commiſſions in their ſeveral Dioceſſes, to name
Aſſeſſors, Miniſters and Gentlemen, which might puniſh Offenders.
And tho the Common-Prayer, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> was the ſame
with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> yet in the Adminiſtration of the Sacrament the
Form was the ſame in the Maſs, without the Exhortations in the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Common-Prayer.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Trial how paſſable they would be was upon <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi>
the Service was read at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> when no Tumult followed;
but when it was next read, the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>July</hi> following, all the
City was in an Uproar, and the next day the Lords of the Council
iſſued out a Proclamation to diſcharge the Tumults of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
upon pain of Death; yet divers Miniſters at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the reading of the Common-Prayer, and petitioned the Council
againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Harveſt coming on, all things ſeemed quiet, but at the end of it
<hi>Edinburgh</hi> ſwelled with all ſorts of People: the Council fearing
whereto this Concourſe would tend, by three Proclamations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
all ſorts of People (not Inhabitants, or not having Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs)
to depart upon Penalty of Horning and Rebellion: Inſtead
of Obedience, the Women and Children petition the Council a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Common-Prayer-Book, and ſoon after the Noblemen,
Barons, Miniſters, Burgeſſes and Commons; which were ſent to the
King, who commanded the Privy-Council to ſignify his Majeſty's
Averſneſs to Popery and Superſtition. In this Confuſion the Earl
of <hi>Traquair</hi> Treaſurer, and <hi>Roxborough</hi> Privy-Seal, go to the King
for Inſtructions how to proceed; their Inſtructions were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the Seſſion or Term to <hi>Sterling,</hi> and by Proclamation to
forbid all Perſons coming to <hi>Sterling,</hi> unleſs they declare the cauſe
to the Council, and procure a Warrant for the ſame upon Penalty
of High-Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>This Proclamation was encountred by a Proteſtation of Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Barons, Miniſters and Burgers at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> againſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Idolatry and Superſtition, the Common-Prayer-Book, Canons
and High-Commiſſion: And they enter into a ſolemn Covenant to
maintain the Confeſſion of Faith, ſubſcribed by the King's Father
and his Houſhold, 1580, and after by all Ranks of People, 1581,
to which they ſwear a mutual Defence of one another againſt all
Oppoſers; and to this purpoſe they erected Tables or Perſons to
take Subſcriptions of all ſorts of People.</p>

                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:60932:136"/>
                     <hi>Traquair</hi> could not ſtem the Tide, and ſo acquainted the King
herewith, who ſends the Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton</hi> his Commiſſioner,
with Inſtructions one way or other to compoſe theſe Diſorders.
When he came into <hi>Scotland,</hi> he firſt demanded of the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
what they required of the King for accommodating their
Grievances. Secondly, What might be expected from them for
returning to their former Obedience, eſpecially renouncing their
Covenant. But nothing would content them but a General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
and free Parliament: they forbid him the uſe of the Common-Prayer
in the King's Chappel, and admoniſh him and the Council
to ſubſcribe their Covenant. Theſe Proceedings running ſo high,
the Marqueſs durſt not purſue his Inſtructions, being ſure they
would be affronted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Marqueſs gives the King an account of theſe things, and
deſires further Inſtructions,</hi> which were to gain time till the King
could get a Fleet and an Army in readineſs to compel the Covenanters to
Obedience, but not to conſent to the calling of a Parliament or General
Aſſembly till the Covenant be given up; that now his Crown and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
for ever lies at ſtake; that he had rather ſuffer the firſt,
which time would help, than the laſt, which is irreparable; that the
Explanation of the damnable Covenant makes him to have no more
Power than a Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> which he will rather die than ſubmit
to: <hi>Yet without dying he did ſubmit to the Revocation of the
Service-Book, Canons, High-Commiſſion, and the Articles of</hi> Perth,
<hi>forſakes the Biſhops, and by a Proclamation,</hi> Sept. 22, 1638,
<hi>commands the Covenant to be ſubſcribed by the Privy-Council and
all his</hi> Scotiſh <hi>Subjects; but this would not content the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
becauſe it came not from a General Aſſembly, and becauſe the
Band of mutual Defence was not in the Proclamation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having gone thus far, there was no going back, and the King's
Army and Navy was not yet ready, the King therefore indicts a
General Aſſembly to be held the <hi>21ſt</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 1638, at <hi>Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow,</hi>
and a Parliament to meet at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>The General Aſſembly met accordingly, but the Marqueſs and
the Aſſembly were at Variance about the Elections and Votes of
the Lay-Elders, and the Biſhops ſitting in the Aſſembly, and the
Votes of the King's Aſſeſſors in it: But what the Marqueſs would
have, the Covenanters would not, whereupon the Marqueſs on the
<hi>28th</hi> diſſolves the Aſſembly upon Penalty of High-Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>The Covenanters and General Aſſembly proteſt againſt this Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and ſit notwithſtanding, yet profeſs all Duty and Obedience
to the King in its due Line and Courſe, which in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> is,
<hi>They'll do what they will; and if the King will do what they would
have him, they will be obedient Subjects.</hi> And in this Seſſion they
depoſe and excommunicate all the Biſhops of <hi>Scotland.</hi> To this

State within leſs than two Years has his Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Weſton</hi> Earl of <hi>Portland</hi> died in the Year 1634, and Dr. <hi>Juxton,</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> was made Lord-Treaſurer, by whoſe prudent
Management it's ſaid, that in leſs than five Years he had lodged
900000 <hi>l.</hi> in the Exchequer; and now the King had raiſed an Army
of about 20000 Horſe and Foot, made the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
Lord Viſcount <hi>Wentworth</hi> Lieutenant-General, and Earl of
<hi>Holland</hi> General of the Horſe; and had fitted up a Navy, with
5000 Land-Men commanded by Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> to compel
the <hi>Scots</hi> to their Obedience, and marches at the Head of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
himſelf.</p>
                  <p>It was time, for the <hi>Scots</hi> were up in Arms too, had ſeized the
<hi>Regalia</hi> at <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and brought them to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> taken <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barton,</hi>
and routed the <hi>Scots</hi> who took the King's part at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi>
which they likewiſe took.</p>
                  <p>This King's good Nature never more appeared than in his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities;
ſo that when he came to <hi>York,</hi> by Proclamation he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd
31 Monopolies and Patents formerly granted by him, he not
before underſtanding how grievous they were to his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scots,</hi> that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might have no Jealouſy of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion,
had reſolved not to come within ten Miles of the Borders
with their Army. When the King came to <hi>Berwick,</hi> the Earl of
<hi>Holland</hi> made two vain and inconſiderate Incurſions into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and upon the Approach of the <hi>Scots</hi> retreated; and theſe were
the only Actions of this War by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the Retreat of the Earl the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army was contemned
by the <hi>Scots,</hi> who advanced to the Borders, and pitched their Tents
in ſight of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> before any notice was given of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
this raiſed a Murmur all over the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, where Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
were not only ſcant, but their Bread and Biſcake mouldy,
nor was there any proſpect of a further Supply.</p>
                  <p>However the <hi>Scots</hi> propoſe a Treaty of Accommodation, which
the King's Neceſſities compell'd him to ſubmit to, which being
made (the Terms you may read in <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>'s and <hi>Franklin</hi>'s
Collections) the King disbands his Army, and withdraws his Navy;
this was all the <hi>Scots</hi> cared for; for the Treaty being upon equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal
Terms, the <hi>Scots</hi> were reſolved to make their own Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and ſtand by it, and to that purpoſe hold Correſpondence
with the <hi>French</hi> King, and ſtile him <hi>Au Roy,</hi> and alſo with the

                  <p>This Year my Lord-Keeper <hi>Coventry</hi> died, and Sir <hi>John Finch,</hi>
Chief-Juſtice of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> was made Lord-keeper of the
Great Seal, no doubt for promoting the Legality of <hi>Ship-money,</hi>
and enlarging the Bounds of the Foreſts.</p>
                  <p>The Cloud riſing ſo thick in the <hi>North,</hi> preſaged a Storm, which
to diſſipate, the King ſummons a Parliament to meet the <hi>23d</hi> of
<hi>April,</hi> 1640. the Arch-biſhop and the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> giving
out, according to the Advice which Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> gave the
Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> that they were the firſt Movers of it.</p>
                  <p>At the opening of this Parliament, the King lays before them
his Neceſſities for Money in the firſt place, as he had done in all
the three Parliaments before, and that Delay was all one with a
Denial, and communicates to them the <hi>Covenanters</hi> Letter to the
<hi>French</hi> King, imploring his Aſſiſtance: But the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
having found the Effects of giving Money before Grievances
were redreſt, both in the <hi>18th</hi> of his Father's Reign, and in the
firſt of his, began at Grievances, now multiplied by the Additions
of <hi>Ship-Money,</hi> breaking the Bounds of the Foreſts, and Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies
multiplied without end, the Arbitrary Power of the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi>
and <hi>High-Commiſſion</hi> againſt thoſe who oppoſed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the Innovations brought into the Church, and the
Impriſonment, and unheard-of Cenſures of their Members for their
Proceedings in the Houſe laſt Parliament; ſo that inſtead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
any Benefit by the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> the Church and State
was in a manifold worſe State than before: they had now found
by Experience, that no Laws or Judgments in Parliament could
bind the King's Prerogative, but that he would act quite contrary,
as in the Caſes of <hi>Mountague</hi> and <hi>Manwaring,</hi> &amp;c. and how could
the Parliament rely upon his <hi>Royal Word</hi> (which he would upon
all occaſions give) when they found no Aſſurance in any Law, nor
ſo many Declarations of his obſerving them?</p>
                  <p>However, the Commons upon the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>May</hi> reſolved to take
care of ſupplying the King upon the <hi>4th,</hi> when Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>
told them, that the King of his Grace and Favour upon their
granting 12 Subſidies to be paid in three Years, would forbear
levying <hi>Ship-Money,</hi> and aboliſh it; and for their Grievances, they
ſhould rely upon his Royal Promiſe, and give as much time now
as may be, and after at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> next; and that the King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
a poſitive Anſwer.</p>

                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:60932:137"/>
Hereupon the Houſe was turned into a grand Committee, and
ſpent the whole Day upon the Meſſage, but came to no Reſolution,
and deſired Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> to acquaint the King, that the Houſe
would next day proceed upon the King's Supply: But next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
early, Secretary <hi>Windebank</hi> (in actual Correſpondence and
Conſpiracy with <hi>Cunaeus, Richlieu</hi>'s Chaplain, for ſubverting our
Religion, and introducing Popery) commanded the Speaker to
<hi>Whitehall,</hi> and the ſame Day the King diſſolved the Parliament,
and the next Day the Lord <hi>Brook</hi>'s Study, Cabinet, and Pockets,
were ſearched for Papers, and Mr. <hi>Bellaſis</hi> and Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi>
were convened before the Council, to anſwer concerning Paſſages
in Parliament; and giving no ſatisfactory Anſwer, were committed
Priſoners to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> till further Order from the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
and Mr. <hi>Crew</hi> was committed cloſe Priſoner to the <hi>Tower,</hi> till
further Order from the Council; and no Cauſe ſhewed in either
of theſe Warrants.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt Objection againſt Hereditary Monarchy is, that
Princes Ears are always open to Minions, Flatterers, and Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
whereby they rarely underſtand the ſtate of their own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
or of their Subjects: To attemper this, the Wiſdom of our
Conſtitution ordains, That Parliaments be frequently held, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
to the King the ſtate of the Nation, and ſo to inform him
of Grievances, that they may be redreſſed. And ſo inviolably
has this mutual Correſpondence between the King and Parliament
been obſerved in all Ages, that I do not believe any King or Queen
of <hi>England,</hi> and of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Race ſince <hi>Henry</hi> 3. ever diſſolved
one Parliament in Diſpleaſure, before King <hi>James;</hi> whereas of
eight Parliaments, theſe two Kings, of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Race, diſſolved
ſeven in Diſpleaſure. Yet never did Parliaments, in any Reign,
demean themſelves more chearfully to any King than to theſe two:
and I challenge any one to ſhew, that in any one reſpect they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched
upon any juſt Prerogative of either of theſe Kings, or
did any Act not warranted by former Precedents.</p>
                  <p>It's true, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would not endure to have the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to meddle with the ſtate of the Church as 'twas eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor hear of declaring a Succeſſor; and when either of theſe
were moved contrary to her expreſs Order, ſhe would commit
the Members, but eaſily diſmiſs them; otherwiſe, I believe in
no Age any Member of Parliament was ever committed or cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by any King of <hi>England</hi> before King <hi>James,</hi> for debating or
reaſoning of the ſtate of the Nation or Church.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>Edward 3. John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> the King's Son, the
Lords <hi>Latimer</hi> and <hi>Nevil,</hi> were accuſed in Parliament for miſadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the King, and were ſent to the <hi>Tower</hi> for it; and <hi>Henry 4.
Rot. Parl.</hi> 5. upon the Complaint of the Commons againſt four of
his Servants and Counſellors, that they might be removed, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60932:138"/>
openly, That tho he knew nothing againſt them in particular,
yet he was aſſured that what the Lords and Commons required
of him, was for the Good of himſelf and Kingdom; and therefore
he baniſh'd them, and at the ſame time declared he would do ſo
by any other who ſhould be near his Royal Perſon, if they were
ſo unhappy as to fall under the Hatred of his People.</p>
                  <p>Whereas this King, tho the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> were accuſed
of more Crimes in Parliament, than is recorded of <hi>Pierce Gaveſton,</hi>
and the <hi>Spencers</hi> in <hi>Edw. 2d</hi>'s time, and of the Duke of <hi>Ireland,
Treſilian,</hi> and <hi>Belknap,</hi> in <hi>Rich. 2d</hi>'s time, and of the Death of
this King's Father to boot; yet rather than the Duke ſhall be
brought to Trial, the King diſſolves the ſecond Parliament of his
Reign: And in his Declaration for diſſolving the three Parliaments,
calls the queſtioning his Miniſters an Invaſion upon his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and that through them they endeavoured to wound their
Soveraign's Honour and Government.</p>
                  <p>Since the Statute <hi>De Tallagio non Concedendo,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the I, I think no mention has been made that ever any King
of <hi>England</hi> taxed the Subject before this King and his Father, except
<hi>Edward</hi> the IV by Benevolence, for which his Memory is bitterly
ſtained in the Parliament-Roll of the ſecond Chapter of <hi>Richard</hi>
the III, tho it be not in the printed Statutes; and by a <hi>Loan</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII by Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> the
raiſing of which had near raiſed a Rebellion; which when it came
to the King's Ear, he laid the Blame upon the Cardinal, and ſaid,
he would not rend his Subjects from the Law, and forbid further
proceeding in it.</p>
                  <p>Arch-biſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> excepts againſt his Licenſing <hi>Sybthorp</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
for that the King's taxing Loans by his own Authority, was
neither by the Laws nor Cuſtoms of <hi>England:</hi> the King in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
ſays, He <hi>did not ſtand upon the Laws and Cuſtoms of</hi> England,
<hi>for he had a Precedent for it, and would inſiſt upon it.</hi> The Arch-biſhop
replied, <hi>He thought it was a Miſtake, and feared there was
no ſuch Precedent; and that</hi> Henry <hi>the VIII deſired but the ſixth part
of Mens Eſtates, but the King required the full ſix Parts, ſo much
as the Men are ſet at in the Subſidy-Book.</hi> And when the Commons
in the third Year of his Reign made a Remonſtrance againſt the
King's taking Tunnage and Poundage, not granted by Parliament,
the King calls this a detracting from their Soveraign, and commands
all who have or ſhall have any Copies of it, to burn them upon
Pain of his Indignation and high Diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The King for Cauſes of diſſolving this Parliament, (the laſt he
ſhall ever diſſolve) begins with the uſual Stile, That he well knows,
that the Calling, Adjourning, Proroguing and Diſſolving Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are undoubted Prerogatives inſeparably annexed to his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Crown; of which he is not bound to give any Account, but
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60932:138"/>
to God alone, no more than of his other Regal Actions. But <hi>quid
gloriaris?</hi> Did ever any King of <hi>England</hi> ſay this before his Father
and himſelf? Or in what common-Law, or Acts of Parliament is
this to be found? Or if he had ſuch Power, Why does the King
ſo often boaſt of it? Sure it had been better done by another
than himſelf. Is this a time of day, when this Prince had loſt all
his Honour abroad, to magnify himſelf that he has Power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
Parliaments at home, and thereby obſtruct thoſe Ways by
which he might unite himſelf to his Subjects, and then glory that
he is only accountable to God for all his Actions? <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s
Boaſt, <hi>Is not this the</hi> Babel <hi>which I have built?</hi> was but a Bauble
to this. He ſaid this but once, <hi>and God ſent him ſeven Years among
Wild Beaſts; and he ſaw his Pride, and he repented:</hi> This King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Occaſions makes his Boaſts; but I do not find he ever repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of any of them.</p>
                  <p>But admit the King had this Power, and alſo that the Opening,
Adjourning and Proroguing Terms, and granting Commiſſions of
<hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> and times of their Sitting and Continuance for
Executing Juſtice, be Prerogatives inſeparable to the Imperial
Crown, of which he is accountable to God only: Yet if he ſhall
not open the <hi>Terms,</hi> or grant Commiſſions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer;</hi>
or if he does refuſe to have Juſtice done between himſelf and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
or between his Subjects, but inſtead thereof prorogue or
adjourn <hi>Terms,</hi> and withcall his Commiſſions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
and declare to Him only belongs the Power of opening the
Terms, and of granting Commiſſions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> and
that he is only accountable to God for all his Actions; would
not this be a Failure of Juſtice? and can any Man believe that he
would be God's Vicegerent herein for the Good and Benefit of his
Subjects?</p>
                  <p>The Act of the 25 of <hi>Edward</hi> the III determines what Treaſons
are cogniſable by the King's Judges, but the other Treaſons at
Common-Law are only determinable in Parliament; and one of
the chiefeſt Ends in calling Parliaments, is when the Judges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or Miniſters of State becoming corrupt, and too great for
the ordinary Courts of Juſtice, they may be puniſhed in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
it is therefore greater Injuſtice, and infinitely more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to the King and Subjects, to deny the Nation this Right,
than to deny Juſtice to particular Subjects.</p>
                  <p>The King is Head of the Common-wealth, and the Laws and
Conſtitutions of the Nation unite them into one Body; which
if they ceaſe, there is neither King nor Common-wealth; and by
the 4 <hi>Edw. 3. c.</hi> 4. Parliaments ſhall be holden every Year;
and by 36 <hi>Edw. 3. c.</hi> 10. Parliaments ſhall be holden once
a Year, and oftner, if need be, that Grievances and Miſchiefs be
redreſt: How then does it become the King to glory, that the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:60932:139"/>
Adjourning, Proroguing and Diſſolving Parliaments are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Prerogatives, inſeparably annexed to the Imperial Crown?
which in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> is to ſay, <hi>It is a Prerogative inſeparable to the
Imperial Crown, to rend himſelf from his Subjects, and to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
neither King, nor the Nation his Subjects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the King be accountable only to God for his Actions, how
comes it that he ſo often appeals to the People by theſe Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
againſt their Repreſentatives, or rather againſt the People
and their Repreſentatives, to his own Minions and Flatterers;
which are worſe than any other Rebels and Traitors? for theſe
appear barefac'd what they are, whereas thoſe ſteal away the
Love and Obedience of his Subjects, and provoke them either to
be Rebels and Traitors, or careleſs to aſſiſt him againſt ſuch as are:
And this was the Caſe of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>2d;</hi>
and now it comes faſt upon this unhappy King, for ſo hereafter
he will ever be.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>September</hi> this Year the <hi>Dutch</hi> fell upon a Fleet of the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Downs</hi> ſo furiouſly, as, being 53 in Number,
made them cut their Cables, and run 23 of them on Shoar, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
3 were burnt, 2 periſhed on the Shoar; the Remainder of
the other 23 were deſerted by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and mann'd by the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> to ſave them from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the other 30 put to Sea,
of which only 10 eſcaped: Yet the King, however he gloried in
being ſtiled <hi>Soveraign of the</hi> Britiſh <hi>Seas,</hi> took no Care to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
this againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to whom he was now become as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
as to his <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Subjects. Now let's ſee how things
ſtood in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Pacification between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> yet full of
Jealouſy on either Part, the King ſent for 14 of the principal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters
to come to him at <hi>Berwick,</hi> which the <hi>Scots</hi> refuſed, and
only ſent <hi>Montroſs, Lowden,</hi> and <hi>Lowthian;</hi> theſe three Lords ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much mollified by what the King had granted, and promiſed
all Obedience to the King.</p>
                  <p>The King urged <hi>Hamilton</hi> to be his Commiſſioner, which he
refuſing, he made <hi>Traquair,</hi> but tied him up to cloſe Inſtructions,
and in <hi>Auguſt</hi> he indicts a General Aſſembly: the Biſhops proteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it; and the Covenanters ſupplicate the Commiſſioners and
Council, that Epiſcopacy be declared unlawful, and the Covenant
ſubſcribed by all the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation; which the Commiſſioners
verbally conſented to.</p>
                  <p>Here you muſt underſtand, that the Covenanters make the <hi>Kirk</hi>
a diſtinct Table or Body from the Civil, of which <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi>
is the only Head; and that the Parliament is obliged to paſs all
the Acts of a General Aſſembly: ſo that though by many Acts of
Parliament, the Biſhops Sitting and Voting in Parliament is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
and confirmed; yet the voting Epiſcopacy to be unlawful,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:60932:139"/>
hath reſcinded all thoſe Acts of Parliament: for <hi>Sublata Cauſa, tolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
&amp; effectus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> in 1639, the Parliament met; but
upon the Difference between the Houſes and the Earl of <hi>Traquair,</hi>
about naming Lords of the Articles, the Earl prorogues them to
the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> which the Parliament proteſt againſt,
and declare all Proceedings in Parliament to be as valid, as if no
Prorogation had been.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament hereupon appoint a Committee to repreſent
this to the King, and in the mean time to expect the King's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
and make the Earl of <hi>Dumfermling</hi> and the Lord <hi>Lowden</hi> their
Deputies to do it, who coming without Warrant from the Earl of
<hi>Traquair,</hi> were commanded back again without Audience.</p>
                  <p>Then the King commands the Commiſſioner <hi>Traquair</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogue
the Parliament to the ſecond of <hi>June</hi> in 1640, and that
<hi>Traquair</hi> ſhould come and give an account of the Matters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
in Parliament; and <hi>Traquair</hi> having gotten one of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which the Covenanters had ſent to the <hi>French</hi> King for his
Protection and Aſſiſtance of the Covenanters, ſubſcribed by
<hi>Rothes, Montroſs, Leſley, Mountgomery, Lowden</hi> and <hi>Foreſter,</hi> brings
this with him, and delivers it to the King, for which the <hi>Scots</hi>
would never forgive the Earl, but ever after deemed him an
Incendiary.</p>
                  <p>This yet being unknown to the Covenanters, they petition the
King to permit them to ſend ſome of their Members to vindicate
their Proceedings; which the King did, and they ſent the Earl of
<hi>Dumfermling</hi> and <hi>Lowden</hi> again. The King when they came to <hi>London</hi>
claps <hi>Lowden</hi> cloſe Priſoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and expected that this
Confederacy between the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> would be a means to
procure the Parliament to aſſiſt him more powerfully againſt
the <hi>Scots:</hi> but the King having diſſolved the Parliament, he as
ſuddenly diſmiſt him as before he had committed him, which
did the King no good.</p>
                  <p>This unhappy King would as eaſily be excited to give harſh
language as be put upon ſudden Actions, and as ſoon leave
them, and often proceed quite contrary: And now the King taxes
the <hi>Scots</hi> Proceedings to be Traiterous and Rebellious, and cauſes
a Paper publiſhed by the <hi>Scots</hi> after the Pacification to be burnt
by the Hand of the common Hangman; but the <hi>Scots</hi> inſiſted
their Proceedings to be according to the Covenant, which they
could not ſtart from, and that therein they were the King's moſt
Dutiful Subjects.</p>
                  <p>Things could not long ſtay here, but upon the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi>
in 1640, the <hi>Scots</hi> enter <hi>England</hi> with an Army of about 22000
Men, commanded by General <hi>Leſley,</hi> to deliver a Petition for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of Religion and State, and to juſtify their Proceedings,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:60932:140"/>
and begin as the King did at the opening of all his Parliaments,
with the Neceſſity of their Proceedings.</p>
                  <p>The King the ſame day the <hi>Scots</hi> entred <hi>England,</hi> poſts to <hi>York,</hi>
having made the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> General of his Army,
the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> Lieutenant-General, and my Lord Marſhal,
the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> General of his Forces on the South-ſide of
<hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the King came to <hi>York,</hi> his firſt Care was to ſtop the
<hi>Scots</hi> from paſſing the River <hi>Tine,</hi> and commanded the Lord <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>
and Sir <hi>Jacob Aſtly</hi> to oppoſe them; but the <hi>Scots</hi> having
the advantage of the Ground, and ſixfold more in number than
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> force their Paſſage at <hi>Newborn,</hi> about five Miles from
<hi>Newcaſtle</hi> to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and take <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and after <hi>Durham,</hi>
and tax the Counties of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Durham</hi> at 850 <hi>l.</hi> a
day, but the Rents of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the Church of <hi>Durham</hi> they
take over and above.</p>
                  <p>The King inſtead of fighting the <hi>Scots,</hi> is encountred with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
from the Inhabitants of <hi>Yorkſhire, Durham</hi> and <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi>
of the Miſeries of their Condition; then with Petitions
from many of the Nobility, the City of <hi>London,</hi> and other Places,
for a free Parliament: upon this the King aſſembles a great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of the Nobility to adviſe what to do.</p>
                  <p>Now things are brought to the Point <hi>Richlieu</hi> had deſigned
them: The King in theſe two Expeditions had ſpent all the
900000 <hi>l.</hi> he before had lodged in his Exchequer, and now had
two Armies to maintain in the Bowels of his Kingdom, when he
not only had no means to pay either, but alſo without doubt the
<hi>Scotiſh</hi> Army were Penſioners to <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lords adviſe a Truce, which is accepted, and all agreed,
but how to pay the Armies till a Parliament meet, was a Queſtion:
the <hi>Scots</hi> coming for all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mens Gudes, demand but
40000 <hi>l. per Menſem,</hi> but, like their Country Pedlars, fall to
25000 <hi>l.</hi> which is agreed; which, with the Charge of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Army, would amount to 60000 <hi>l. per Menſem,</hi> to ſave the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
from Free-quarter.</p>
                  <p>In this Treaty the King named the Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi> to be aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Peers; but the <hi>Scots</hi> excepted againſt him as
an Incendiary, and one to be brought to Puniſhment; the King
ſubmits, and leaves him out. But how to provide Money to pay
both Armies till the meeting of the Parliament, which was to
meet the third of <hi>November,</hi> is the Queſtion: The King had not
Credit, it could not be had but from the City of <hi>London,</hi> which
was upon ill Terms with the King; for Alderman <hi>Atkins,</hi> Sir <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas
Ranton,</hi> and Alderman <hi>Geere,</hi> were by Order of the Council,
in Priſons in <hi>London,</hi> and the Attorney-General had Orders to draw
an Information againſt them in the Star-Chamber, for refuſing to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:60932:140"/>
return the Names of ſuch as were able to lend upon a Loan of
200000 <hi>l.</hi> demanded by the King.</p>
                  <p>The Lords therefore of the Great Council write to the City of
<hi>London,</hi> ſignifying the King's gracious Reſolution of calling a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
wherein he promiſed all Grievances to be redreſt, the
Miſeries of the Country, if the Armies were not paid; and not
leſs than 200000 <hi>l.</hi> could prevent them, and the Lords would give
their Bonds for the City's Security; whereupon the City lent the
Money, and then the Treaty was adjourned from <hi>Rippon</hi> to
<hi>London.</hi> But that we may better ſee how things ſtood at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Parliament, let us look back a little.</p>
                  <p>After the King had diſſolved the Parliament, <hi>May</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> he
left the Convocation ſitting, who frame an Oath, wherein they
ſwear never to conſent to alter the Government of the Church by
Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, Deans and Arch-deacons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it ſtands
now eſtabliſhed, and as by right it ought to ſtand (which was
interpreted to be <hi>Jure Divino.)</hi> They alſo made ſixteen Canons,
and <hi>Goodman</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> for refuſing to ſubſcribe the
Oath and Canons, was ſuſpended: <hi>Being encouraged by</hi> Mountague,
<hi>Biſhop of</hi> Norwich, <hi>and</hi> Laud'<hi>s Creature, who,</hi> Goodman <hi>ſaid, had in
his Perſon viſited, and held Correſpondence with the Pope's Nuncio, and
received his Letters in behalf of his Son, who was then travelling to</hi>
Rome, <hi>and by his Letters had extraordinary Entertainment there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor did the Convocation ſtay here, but granted the King a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence
of ſix Subſidies to be paid in ſix Years, the Refuſers to
be ſuſpended and excommunicated: To ſuch an Extremity did the
Clergy puſh things in this techy and diſorderly time. But any
Man may eaſily gueſs the Spring which ſet all theſe Wheels in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And it is obſervable, that the Clergy, who now taxed their
fellow Subjects without Conſent of the Commons, ſhall ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
be taxed by the Commons, without the Conſent of the
Clergy.</p>

                  <p>UPon the third of <hi>November</hi> the Parliament met, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which for above fifteen Years had been ridden by a

(I mean the Houſes) to become their Redeemers; and by how
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:60932:141"/>
much more Honour the Nation gives them, ſo much leſs they leave
to the King: And here again you may ſee the unhappy Fate of
Princes, who treat their Subjects as Enemies, and Favourites as
their only Friends and Confidents: For the firſt that forſook the
King and run beyond Sea, was <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s old Friend, Secretary
<hi>Windebank;</hi> next after him flies <hi>Finch,</hi> and after the Earl of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del;</hi>
and ſcarce one of his old Favourites, I mean before the <hi>Scots</hi>
Troubles, ſtood by him, except my Lord <hi>Cottington:</hi> Secretary
<hi>Cooke</hi> was either really or politickly ſick; <hi>Juxton,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi>
indifferent, and in all the Wars lived in the Parliament Quarters,
but all the reſt ſided with the Parliament againſt him: Only <hi>Laud</hi>
and <hi>Strafford</hi> are laid in Priſon, and after put to Death.</p>
                  <p>Nor were the Factions leſs pliable to entertain theſe Minions
and Favourites, than they were forward to join with them: I'll
give you one Inſtance herein; In this Parliament all thoſe who
would not join them were called <hi>Delinquents;</hi> and upon a Debate
in the Houſe of Commons, concerning an Order in the Star-Chamber
ſigned by my Lord Privy-Seal, Secretary <hi>Cooke,</hi> and others,
it was moved to ſend for Secretary <hi>Cooke</hi> as a Delinquent: Another
Member (my neareſt Relation, from whom I had this) moved,
That ſince Sir <hi>John Cooke</hi> was aged and infirm, and above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Miles off, and my Lord Privy-Seal in Town, therefore that
the Houſe ſhould proceed againſt my Lord: To whom Mr. <hi>Pym</hi>
reply'd, <hi>That whatever my Lord's</hi> ante Acta Vitae <hi>were, yet ſince he
now went right, that all ought to be forgotten.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, ſo zealous were theſe new-converted Minions and Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
that rather than forſake their Seats in Parliament, they'll loſe
their Places at Court. You have heard how my Lord Privy-Seal
became Lord Chief-Juſtice of the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> after which the
King made him Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> Lord Privy-Seal, and Preſident
of the Council; my Lord-Keeper <hi>Coventry</hi> was upright in all his
Decrees, but my Lord Privy-Seal ſets up the Court of <hi>Requeſts</hi>
to have a concurring Juriſdiction with the <hi>Chancery;</hi> and Men
whom my Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> did not pleaſe, brought their Cauſes into
the Court of <hi>Requeſts;</hi> ſo that in a ſhort time the Practice of
this Court ſwell'd ſo much, that my Lord Privy-Seal made more
Clerks and Attorneys than ever was known before.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> ſent to the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> that he (the King)
would have <hi>Hatton-Houſe</hi> in <hi>Holborn</hi> for Prince <hi>Charles</hi> his Court,
and that the King would be at the Charges for maintaining the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's
Title, tho the Biſhop told me it coſt him many a Pound:
ſo in the Biſhop's Name a Suit was commenced in the Court of
<hi>Requeſts</hi> for <hi>Hatton-Houſe.</hi> Before the new Buildings were built,
<hi>Hatton-Garden</hi> was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

my Lady <hi>Hatton</hi> had planted it with the beſt Fruit, Vines and
Flowers which could be got; but upon commencing this Suit ſhe
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:60932:141"/>
deſtroy'd all the Plantations, yet defended her Cauſe with all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
imaginable: But at laſt in 1639, notice was given to my
Lady to hear Judgment; and at the day my Lady appear'd in
Court, when my Lord Privy-Seal demanded of my Lady's Counſel,
<hi>If they had any more to ſay, otherwiſe, upon his Honour, he muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
againſt my Lady.</hi> Hereupon my Lady ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>Good
my Lord, be tender of your Honour, for 'tis very young; and for your
Decree I value it not a Ruſh, for your Court is no Court of Record:</hi>
And the Troubles in <hi>Scotland</hi> growing higher, the King had no
Benefit of the Decree, nor my Lord any Credit in his Court ever
after.</p>
                  <p>Nor were the Deſcendants of many of the King's Favourites
more faithful to the King than their Fathers, as the Lord <hi>Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolton,</hi>
Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> jun. Sir <hi>John Cooke, Henry Martin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now when it was too late, like a Man who begins his Buſineſs
the laſt day of the Term, the King ſeems to alter his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and indulge another ſort of Men in Church and State, who
were oppoſite to the Principles in Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s Regency. Dr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi>
cenſured and impriſoned in the <hi>Tower,</hi> has all the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
againſt him in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> and <hi>High-Commiſſion</hi> revers'd,
and taken off the File; and <hi>Mountague,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> dying
in the beginning of the Parliament, Dr. <hi>Hall</hi> is tranſlated from
<hi>Exeter</hi> to <hi>Norwich,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Brownrig,</hi> a moſt learned and zealous
<hi>Anti-Arminian,</hi> is made Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> &amp;c. my Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
<hi>Pembroke</hi> is removed, and the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> put in his place;
Sir <hi>Robert Holborn</hi> made Attorney-General, and <hi>Oliver St. John</hi>
Solicitor, both which were Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s Counſel againſt the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality
of Ship-Money.</p>
                  <p>But neither theſe Actions, nor the King's repeated Royal Word
could gain Credit with the Parliament, (I mean the Houſes) who
tho at another time they would have dreaded a ſtanding Army,
now reſolve to maintain two, till their Grievances were redreſt:
And ſure now it was a lamentable State the King was reduced to;
he that before, rather than hear of what he had done, did not
care what he did, and therefore diſſolved four Parliaments, now
every day hears of what he had done, yet cannot help it. His
Judges, which before had refuſed to bail his Subjects committed
by the King without Cauſe, are themſelves now committed againſt
the King's Pleaſure, and no Bail to be taken for them: The King's
Cuſtomers, who by the King's Order ſeized and ſold the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
Goods for non-payment of Duties not legally impoſed, are
themſelves ſeized, and fined more than they are worth.</p>
                  <p>Herein the King was only paſſive, but the Houſes would not
ſtay here; but tho the Commons at firſt impeached the Earl of
<hi>Strafford</hi> before the Lords in their Judicial Capacity, wherein the
King's Conſent was not actually neceſſary, yet they after proceeded
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:60932:142"/>
againſt him by Bill, wherein the Attainder muſt be actually aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to by the King, perſonally, or by Commiſſion, which the King
did, my Lord Privy-Seal and the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> (I believe very
unwillingly) being Commiſſioners; and the ſame day paſſed an
Act, <hi>That the Parliament ſhould not be Prorogued, Adjourned, nor
Diſſolved without their own Conſent,</hi> which proved as great a Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
as the King's proroguing and diſſolving them at Pleaſure.
And the paſſing theſe Laws ſo frightned my Lord Treaſurer <hi>Jux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
the Maſter of the Court of Wards, and the Governor of the
Prince, that they all reſign'd their Places.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe, the King paſſed an Act for a Triennial Parliament
to meet, if not by uſual means, then by others, whether the
King would or not. And an Act for the utter aboliſhing the Star-Chamber
and High-Commiſſion Courts: And to make it a <hi>Praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire</hi>
in every one of the Privy-Council to determine any Cauſes
cogniſable at Common Law: An Act to aboliſh the Court of the
Council and Preſident of the North; and an Act to reſcind the
Juriſdiction of the Court of Stanneries: An Act to repeal the
Branch of a Statute made the firſt of <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. to authorize
Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, natural born Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> to reform
Errors, Hereſies, Schiſms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An Act for declaring Ship-Money,
and all Proceedings therein void: An Act for aſcertaining the
Bounds and Limits of the Foreſts as they were in the <hi>20th</hi> Year of
King <hi>James:</hi> And an Act to prevent the vexatious Proceedings
touching the Order of Knighthood. Theſe Acts thus paſſed, the
Houſes thought themſelves ſecure enough, and ſo paid off and
disbanded the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Armies, and ſent the <hi>Scots</hi> into
their Country again.</p>
                  <p>The much greater part of the Gentry, and alſo of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of both Houſes, would have been content to have ſtaid here;
and many believed if the Parliament had met at <hi>York</hi> or <hi>Oxford,</hi>
they would; but this could not be without diſguſting the City of
<hi>London,</hi> from which only the Loan of 200000 <hi>l.</hi> could be raiſed
for Payment of the Armies till Proviſion could be made by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>But it was decreed that things ſhould not reſt here; and that
the Faction in the Houſe of Commons might get a Majority at one
Vote, as they order'd it, they voted all thoſe who had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
in Monopolies, or in Ship-Money, or Collectors of the
Cuſtoms, out of the Houſe, and others to be choſen in their Places:
And the Rabble in the City in Tumults exclaim'd againſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and Popiſh Lords Votes; hereupon the Biſhops enter their
Proteſtations againſt all Proceedings till they might ſit and vote
freely, whereupon they are committed to the Tower, and a Law
was paſſed to diſable the whole Hierarchy for the future to have any
Place in Parliament.</p>

                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:60932:142"/>
As the <hi>Scots</hi> began their Reformation with a <hi>Covenant,</hi> ſo the
<hi>Commons</hi> began theirs with a <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> wherein they Promiſe,
Vow and Proteſt in the Preſence of God, to <hi>maintain the true
Proteſtant Religion expreſſed in the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England,
and, according to their Duty and Allegiance, to maintain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his Majeſty's Royal Perſon and Eſtate, the Power and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of Parliament, and Liberties of the Subjects, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Union and Peace between the Kingdoms of <hi>England,
Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> but herein was the Difference between the
<hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Engliſh;</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> would improve their <hi>Covenant,</hi> and
eſtabliſh it in <hi>England,</hi> but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſcarce ever after care for
their <hi>Proteſtation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, the Commons prevail with the Lords to take it, and
then impoſe it upon the Nation, upon the Penalty of being deemed
Malignants and Diſaffected.</p>
                  <p>The King, little pleaſed with what he had done, and leſs with
what the Houſes had done without him, follows the <hi>Scots</hi> into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and there cajoles the <hi>Covenanters</hi> with all Courtſhip ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable;
makes <hi>Leſley,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> General, Earl of <hi>Leven,</hi> and confers
other Honours upon the <hi>Covenanters;</hi> calls a Parliament, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
to the Extirpation of the Hierarchy, and eſtabliſhes <hi>Presbytery</hi>
as fully as the <hi>Kirk of Scotland</hi> could deſire: The <hi>Scots</hi> at preſent
promiſe all Duty and Obedience to him, but how well the King
found it, in a ſhort time will appear.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the King was thus buſied in <hi>Scotland,</hi> a horrible and
helliſh Maſſacre was perpetrated in <hi>Ireland</hi> by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> upon the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> wherein it's computed above 200000 Proteſtants, Men,
Women and Children, were butcher'd; after which followed an
univerſal Rebellion, excepting in <hi>Dublin, Londonderry</hi> and <hi>Inniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killen,</hi>
which was headed by the Pope's <hi>Nuncio,</hi> a moſt proper Head
for ſuch a Body: Yet ſo intent were the Factions in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland</hi> in eſtabliſhing their Deſigns, that little care was had of
the miſerable Relicks of the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It appears evident to me, that <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s Scarlet was deep dy'd
in the Blood of the poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> in this Maſſacre, for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>1. That the <hi>Scots,</hi> who at this time were Penſioners to <hi>France,</hi>
were not medled with in their Lives and Fortunes, as you may ſee
in Sir <hi>Richard Baker,</hi> f. 315. a, b.</p>
                  <p>2. The King being in <hi>Scotland</hi> when he heard of the Maſſacre of
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Rebellion of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> he moved the Parliament
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> then ſitting, for a ſpeedy Relief to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which
they refus'd. And it's ſtrangely obſervable, That tho the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre
and Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> brake out the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> yet the
King did not proclaim them Rebels till the firſt of <hi>January,</hi> and
then by Proclamation gave a ſtrict Command, that no more than
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:60932:143"/>
forty of them ſhould be printed, and that none of them ſhould
be publiſhed, till his Majeſty's Pleaſure was further ſignified.</p>
                  <p>Upon the King's going into <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Parliament prorogued
themſelves to a certain Day; But the Commons appointed a
Committee to prepare Buſineſs againſt their next Meeting, yet
ſend Spies to obſerve all the King's Actions; and after the King's
Return to <hi>London,</hi> which was upon the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 1641,
the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> upon the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> make a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance
of all the King's Miſcarriages abroad, and of the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
and Illegalities of his Miniſters at home, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his Reign; and that the King might be ſure to ſee it as
well as hear of it, they <hi>print</hi> and <hi>publiſh it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King not being uſed to ſuch <hi>Language,</hi> was ſtung to the
quick by the <hi>Commons</hi> Declaration; and to retaliate it in Act, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the third of <hi>January</hi> enters the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
five of their Members to be tried for <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> for
holding Correſpondence with the <hi>Scots:</hi> Than which he could
not have done a more imprudent Act; for by it he unravelled
all that he had done in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by involving the <hi>Scots</hi> in the
ſame <hi>Crime.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Members had their Agents in the King's moſt ſecret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
and had notice of the King's coming before, and ſo the five
Members were withdrawn. This Act of the King did not only ſet
the Houſe in a Flame, and put the City into Tumults, but brought
<hi>Petitions</hi> from <hi>Buckingham-ſhire,</hi> (where Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> one of the
Five Members, was Knight) that the Privileges of Parliament
might be ſecured, and Delinquents brought to condign Puniſhment.
All this while poor <hi>Ireland</hi> lay bleeding.</p>
                  <p>The King, as unſtable in his Reſolutions as inconſiderate in his
Actions, retracts all he had done, and promiſes not to do ſo again:
But to no purpoſe, for the Members reſolve not to truſt his Royal
Word, Prerogative, and abſolute Will and Pleaſure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will tear the Power of the Militia from him. Rather than
ſuffer this, tho upon the Pretence of Tumults, the King reſolves
to leave <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before the King left <hi>London,</hi> my Lord Mayor Sir <hi>Richard
Gurney,</hi> Sir <hi>George Whitmore,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Garoway,</hi> and other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Citizens, waited upon the King, and engaged, if he would
ſtay, they would guard him with 10000 Men, if occaſion were;
and told him, If he went, he would leave the City open for the
Members to do as they pleaſed, and that they were ſure to be firſt
undone; the King told them he was reſolved: Then Sir <hi>Henry
Garoway</hi> ſaid, <hi>Sir, I ſhall never ſee you again.</hi> However, his Eldeſt
Son, Mr. <hi>William Garoway</hi> (a worthy Gentleman, who yet lives)
went with the King, and followed him in all his Wars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:60932:143"/>
The worthy Citizens proved true Prophets; for ſoon after the
King left <hi>London,</hi> the Members impriſoned my Lord Mayor, Sir
<hi>Henry Garoway,</hi> Sir <hi>George Whitmore,</hi> and all others whom they
ſuſpected would be faithful to the King; and then in <hi>London</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to aſſume the Power of the <hi>Militia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the King left <hi>London,</hi> he went to <hi>York,</hi> and from thence
went towards <hi>Hull,</hi> but is ſhut out of the Town by Sir <hi>John Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi>
whom the King proclaims Traitor; and now before it came
to Sword and Piſtol, Men began a War with their Pens: And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is obſervable, that the Writers for the King chiefly maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Cauſe out of Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>'s <hi>Pleas of the Crown,</hi> which by
Order of the King's Council, was upon Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s Death-Bed,
ſeized as dangerous and ſeditious; and I do not find any who wrote
for the Parliament, ever uſed any one <hi>Topick</hi> out of it to juſtify
their Cauſe; tho it and Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s other Books of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>Juriſdiction of Courts,</hi> were print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Order of the Houſe of Commons, and by them petitioned
that the King would deliver the Originals to Sir <hi>Robert Coke,</hi> Sir
<hi>Edward</hi>'s Heir.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt things were in this Hurly-burly in <hi>England, Portugal</hi> and
<hi>Catalonia</hi> revolt from the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> which as it was a mighty Blow
to <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo it much conduced to the Advancing the Deſigns of
Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>England</hi> things could not hold long at this Stay, but upon
the <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the King comes to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and haſtily ſets
up his Standard there, and invites all his loving Subjects to come
to his Aſſiſtance againſt the Rebels. Never was Nation ſhuffled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch unhappy Circumſtances; for to join the King, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to his <hi>Prerogative Royal,</hi> and <hi>Abſolute Will and Pleaſure;</hi> and
I have oft heard ſeveral of thoſe who followed the King in the War,
ſay, <hi>They as much dreaded the King's overcoming the Parliament-Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as they feared to be overcome by them:</hi> And the Houſes had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Fundamental Conſtitution of the Nation, ſo as no Man
could tell where they would ſtay.</p>
                  <p>Now are things brought to that paſs <hi>Richlieu</hi> deſign'd them,
<hi>viz. England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> in Civil Wars, and <hi>Scotland</hi> Penſioners
to <hi>France,</hi> ſo as he might now ſecurely carry on his Deſigns of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
the Grandeur of <hi>France,</hi> without any Fear of Diſturbance
from hence. And now you may ſee the miſerable Condition the
King's Minions and Favourites had brought upon the King, and all
his Kingdoms: Yet it is obſervable how great the Loyalty of the
Nobility and Gentry was to the King, that from ſo low Beginnings,
in all Appearance they would have ſubdued the Parliament-party,
if the <hi>Scots</hi> next Year had not come to their Aſſiſtance; whereas
in the Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> though the
Grievances of the Nation were more in one Year of this King's
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:60932:144"/>
Reign, than in both their Reigns, yet both were expelled and loſt
their Lives, their Subjects not drawing a Sword in their Defence.</p>

                     <head>An Apology.</head>
                     <p>BEfore we enter upon the War between the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it will not be amiſs to enquire into the Cauſes of it,
and who firſt began it; and whether the King, or Parliament, or
both, deſigned it: And I am the rather induced hereto, becauſe
I am told that I have unjuſtly charged the Parliament with begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the War; and that the contrary appears by a Treatiſe written
by <hi>Tho. May</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
                        <hi>of the Cauſes and Beginning of the Civil Wars in</hi>
England: So that the Queſtion between us is not who firſt deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the War, but who began it. But becauſe Deſignations and
Intentions precede Action, I will begin, ſo far as appears to me,
Whether the King or Parliament firſt deſigned this War, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were not intended by both. And give me leave to ſhew a
little of Mr. <hi>May</hi>'s Partiality in the Buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>I ſay Mr. <hi>May</hi> is partial, where page 13 he ſays, after the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification
made with the <hi>Scots</hi> 1639, that when the King came to
<hi>London,</hi> his Heart was again eſtranged from the <hi>Scots,</hi> and
Thoughts of Peace; he commanded by Proclamation that Paper
which the <hi>Scots</hi> avowed to contain the true Conditions of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification,
to be diſavowed and burnt by the Hands of the common
Hangman: <hi>So that he makes the</hi> Scots <hi>Parties and Judges in their
own Caſe, without mentioning the Articles of the Pacification, or what
the Scots avowed to contain the true Conditions of it.</hi> We will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſet forth the Articles of the Pacification, and let another
Judg whether the <hi>Scots</hi> obſerved them, or had any Thoughts of
Peace. The Articles were,</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The Forces of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be disbanded within 24 Hours after
the Agreement.</item>
                        <item>2. The King's Caſtles, Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be delivered up.</item>
                        <item>3. His Ships to depart after the Delivery of the Caſtles.</item>
                        <item>4. All Perſons, Ships and Goods, detained by the King, to be reſtored.</item>
                        <item>5. No Meetings, Treaties or Conſultations to be by the <hi>Scots,</hi> but ſuch
as ſhall be warranted by Act of Parliament.</item>
                        <item>6. All Fortifications to deſiſt, and be remitted to the King's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</item>
                        <item>7. To reſtore to every Man their Liberties, Lands, Houſes, Goods
and Means.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>The Articles were ſigned by the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Performance of them on their Parts promiſed and expected.</p>
                     <p>The King juſtly performed the Articles on his part: but the
<hi>Scots</hi> kept part of their Forces in being, and all their Officers in
pay; and the Covenanters kept up their Fortification at <hi>Leith,</hi>
                        <pb n="281" facs="tcp:60932:144"/>
and their Meetings and Councils, and inforce Subſcriptions to the
late Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> contrary to the King's Declaration; they
brand thoſe who had taken Arms for the King, as Incendiaries and
Traitors, and null all the Acts of the College of Juſtice, as you may
read in Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s <hi>Memoirs, f.</hi> 29. So that tho the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
all the Articles of Pacification on his Part, the <hi>Scots</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
not one on their Part. Nor did the <hi>Scots</hi> ſtay here, but
publiſhed a Paper very ſeditious againſt the Treaty, which is that
which Mr. <hi>May</hi> ſpeaks of: I do not find the Copy of it; but
even Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi> (no great Friend to the King's Cauſe) calls it
ſo. Nor did the <hi>Scots</hi> ſtay here, but levied Taxes at ten Marks
<hi>per Cent.</hi> and made Proviſion for Arms, as you may read in Sir
<hi>Richard Baker</hi>'s Hiſtory, <hi>f.</hi> 408. and more at large in the ſecond
part of <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>'s Collections; and all this before the King
commanded the <hi>Scots</hi> Paper to be burnt by the Hand of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Hangman: And therefore the King juſtly commanded the

                        <hi>And Mr.</hi> May <hi>ſays,</hi> The honest People of both Nations began to fear
another War.</p>
                     <p>But why does Mr. <hi>May</hi> ſay, the honeſt People began to fear ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
War? Was it honeſt in the <hi>Scots</hi> to break all the Articles of
the Pacification, to keep their Forces in a Body, and their Officers
in Pay, contrary to the Pacification; to raiſe Taxes, and make
Proviſion of Arms; and after all, theſe honeſt Men to begin to
fear another War?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mr.</hi> May <hi>goes on, and ſays,</hi> The King in <hi>December</hi> told the
Council, he intended to call a Parliament in <hi>England</hi> in <hi>April</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
But rational Men did not like it, that it was deferred ſo long;
and that the Preparations for a War in <hi>Scotland</hi> went on in the mean
time.</p>
                     <p>The laſt part is <hi>gratis dictum</hi> by Mr. <hi>May,</hi> nor does he mention
any Preparation for a War, in any one particular; nor do I find
this ſaid by any other: But admit the King had made Preparation
for a War with <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet by all Laws of God and Man, the
King might juſtly have done it, after the <hi>Scots</hi> had broken all the
Articles of <hi>Pacification,</hi> kept an Army on foot againſt it, levied
Taxes by their own Authority, and made Proviſion of Arms with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the King's Authority, which beſides the Perfidiouſneſs of the
<hi>Scots,</hi> is Treaſon in the higheſt degree: And I would be glad to
be informed by what other means the King could vindicate his
Honour, or relieve his oppreſſed Subjects, otherwiſe than by
a War.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mr.</hi> May <hi>goes on, and ſays,</hi> They <hi>(theſe rational Men)</hi> were
likewiſe troubled that the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> a Man
of deep Policy but ſuſpected Honeſty, one whom the King then uſed as
a boſom Counſellor, was first to go into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and call a Parliament
in that Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="282" facs="tcp:60932:145"/>
And what then? Why might not the King call a Parliament in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> as well as in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland?</hi> And if theſe rational
Men did not like it (as he ſays) that a Parliament ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
ſo long in <hi>England,</hi> why ſhould theſe rational Men be ſo
troubled that the King ſhould call a Parliament in <hi>Ireland?</hi> Nor
does Mr. <hi>May</hi> give any Reaſon why they ſhould be ſo troubled.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Beſides, Mr.</hi> May <hi>ſays,</hi> The King at that time had broken up the
Parliament in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which the Scots complained of <hi>(the Buſineſs
of State depending)</hi> as a great Breach of their Liberties, and againſt
the Laws of that Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>So here again, Mr. <hi>May</hi> makes the <hi>Scots</hi> Parties and Judges in
their own Cauſe, and is not ingenuous in thus charging the King
at random, and not ſhewing what Buſineſs of State was then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending:
It's fit therefore to ſhew what Buſineſs of State was then
depending, before Mr. <hi>May</hi>'s rational Men ſhould be ſo troubled
at the King's breaking up the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> having, as before ſaid, violated all the Articles of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification
on their part, and perſecuted the Loyal <hi>Scots,</hi> expreſly
contrary to the Pacification, as Incendiaries and Traitors, levied
Taxes, provided Ammunition of War, and kept an Army on foot:
The Parliament, over and above theſe, formed theſe Demands
to be made to the King.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That Coin be not medled with, but by Advice in Parliament.</item>
                        <item>2. That no Stranger be to command or inhabit in any Caſtles of the
King's, but by their Advice.</item>
                        <item>3. That no Honour be granted to any Stranger, but ſuch as have a
competency of Land-Rent in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. No Commiſſioner or Lieutenancy but for a limited time. And next,
they protest againſt the Precedency of the Lord Treaſurer and Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Seal, as not warranted by any poſitive Law. <hi>See</hi> Baker, 408.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Theſe were the Buſineſſes of State which Mr. <hi>May</hi> ſpeaks of;
which added to what the <hi>Scots</hi> uſurped before, I would know
what Regality would be left for the King, and a Reaſon why
Mr. <hi>May</hi>'s rational Men ſhould be ſo troubled for the King's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>May</hi> drives on, and ſays, Upon which they ſent ſome Lords
into <hi>England,</hi> to intreat the King for a Redreſs of ſuch Injuries as
they had received ſince the Pacification; which were, that the
Parliament was broken up before any Buſineſs done. <hi>If they made
it their Buſineſs to divest the King, as they did, of his Rightful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galities,
the King had reaſon therefore to break them up.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That</hi> Edinburgh <hi>Caſtle was gariſon'd with far more Soldiers
than was needful.</hi> So here the Scots are Parties and Judges in their
own Cauſe; and you need not doubt, but that ſo many Soldiers as ſhall
be able to defend the Caſtle, ſhall be judged by the Scots to be more
than is needful.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="283" facs="tcp:60932:145"/>
                        <hi>That</hi> Dunbritton <hi>Caſtle was gariſon'd by</hi> Engliſh <hi>Soldiers.</hi> And
why might not the King do it? for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as well as <hi>Scots</hi> were
his Subjects. But I dare ſay, if theſe had been the honest rational
<hi>Engliſh</hi>-men <hi>May</hi> ſpeaks of, neither he nor the <hi>Scots</hi> would ever have
complain'd of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the</hi> Scots <hi>which traded to</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>(ſure they
mean Pedlars prohibited by Law) were enforced to take new
Oaths, contrary to their Covenant, and altogether contrary to the
Articles of Pacification:</hi> Whereas their Covenant is a new Oath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their Allegiance: And if there were any ſuch new Oaths, why
do neither the <hi>Scots</hi> nor Mr. <hi>May</hi> name them? or if any ſuch were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
that was ſo far from being altogether contrary to the Articles of
Pacification, that I ſay they were not contrary to any one Article of the
Pacification; unleſs the <hi>Scots</hi> or Mr. <hi>May</hi> could make new Articles of
Pacification, and other than thoſe before mentioned.</p>
                     <p>The King, Mr. <hi>May</hi> ſays, impriſoned thoſe Lords, ſending one
of them, the Earl of <hi>Lowden,</hi> to the Tower, and commanded a
Charge of High Treaſon to be drawn againſt him, concerning a
Letter which the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Covenanters had written to the King of
<hi>France (French King had been as well)</hi> for his Aſſiſtance, and
<hi>Lowden</hi> had ſubſcribed it: But the Accuſation was frivolous, eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
anſwered, and came to nothing, becauſe theſe Letters were not
ſent at all; and beſides, it was before the Pacification, upon which
an Oblivion of all things were agreed.</p>
                     <p>So here are two impertinent and frivolous Anſwers to excuſe a most
treaſonable and rebellious Conſpiracy, to bring in a foreign Power into
<hi>Scotland;</hi> for it was ſubſcribed by <hi>Rothes, Montroſs, Leſley, Marre,
Montgomery, Lowden,</hi> and <hi>Forreſter,</hi> under the Title of <hi>Au Roy,</hi>
or our King, to <hi>Lewis</hi> 13. The first is, That thoſe Letters were not
ſent at all, becauſe they were intercepted by the Earl of <hi>Traquair,</hi>
the King's Commiſſioner in <hi>Scotland.</hi> If Mr. <hi>May</hi> had not been a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
yet the very Heathen, by the Light of Humane Nature, could
have informed him, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <q>
                           <l>—Scelus intra ſe tacitum qui cogitat ullum,</l>
                           <l>Facti Crimen habet.—</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if Conſpiracies of Rebellion and Treaſon against Princes ſhall be
eſteemed frivolous, unleſs they evade into Actions, Princes and States
too would be in a very unſecure ſtate, and all Counſel and Endeavours
to prevent them would be vain and frivolous; and I ſay, here was a
double Overt-Act in this Conſpiracy, one the Conſpirators Meeting, the
other the Subſcribing the Paper.</p>
                     <p>The other Anſwer, That the Pacification was after the Subſcription,
and ſo there was an Oblivion upon it: But the Pacification was reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal
between the King and <hi>Scots;</hi> and if the <hi>Scots</hi> first broke the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:60932:146"/>
Pacification, as they did, let them take all that followed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King had no Reaſon to perform his Part, nor the <hi>Scots</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
if the King had hanged and quartered <hi>Lowden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The War, Mr. <hi>May ſays p.</hi> 16. went on, the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>
commanding in Chief, the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> not being in
Health, who was appointed General. <hi>But if Mr.</hi> May <hi>had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
and impartial, he ſhould have told on which Side the
War began, which he does not;</hi> but only ſays, the Scots had not
been backward, for having been debarred of their Trade, and loſt their
Ships by Seizure, they entred <hi>England</hi> with an Army, expreſſing their
Intentions in writing to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and bringing with them a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the King.</p>
                     <p>Admit all this to be true, the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould firſt have repreſented
this to the King, and what was their Loſs by being debarred of
their Trade, and the Value of their Ships ſo ſeized; and upon Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
to have granted Letters of Reprizal till they had recovered Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:
but of this Mr. <hi>May</hi> ſays not one Word, nor do I find or
believe, the Scots ever did demand Satisfaction before they entred
<hi>England</hi> in open Hoſtility, and in Defiance of the King and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Nation; and for the Manner of bringing their Petition to the
King, it was without Precedent, or ſuch as never was done by any
other People; for they entred <hi>England,</hi> and maintained their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
by Plunder and Rapine upon the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and when <hi>Leſley</hi>
came to <hi>Newborn</hi> upon <hi>Tine,</hi> he craves leave of my Lord <hi>Conway,</hi>
ordered by the King to guard the Paſs there, to paſs with his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
to the King, which my Lord <hi>Conway</hi> granted, with a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Number, but not with his Army. Hereupon <hi>Leſley,</hi> who
had the Night before planted nine Pieces of Cannon on <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>
ſide, by force of them paſſed the <hi>Tine,</hi> and killed and
took 300 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners, and after took <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> and ſeized
four great Ships of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> laden with Corn, and impoſed a
Tax of 350 <hi>l.</hi> a day upon the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> and 300 <hi>l.</hi> a
day upon the County of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> upon pain of Plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and the <hi>Scots</hi> committed many Injuries and Inſolencies upon
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> where the <hi>Scots</hi> quartered; as you may read in
Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s Memoirs, <hi>fol.</hi> 34, 35.</p>
                     <p>Thus was the ſtate of things altered. Mr. <hi>May</hi> ſays, pag. 34.
it ſhould be pag. 18. <hi>And that War which was intended for an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlavement
of both the Nations</hi> (truly ſaid, but untruly intended)
<hi>became the Bond of Concord between them.</hi> God defend the Nation
for time to come, of ſuch Concord, or ſuch Cauſes of it.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament, <hi>Mr.</hi> May <hi>ſays,</hi> began with Matters of Religion:
divers Miniſters who had been of good Lives and Converſations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious
in their ways, and diligent in their Preaching, and had by
the Biſhops and thoſe in Authority, been moteſted and impriſoned, for
not conforming to ſome Ceremonies which were impoſed on them, were
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:60932:146"/>
now by the Parliament relieved and recompenſed for their Suffering:
and others who had been ſcandalous, either for looſe wicked living, or
elſe Offenders in way of Superſtition (both which, to diſcountenance
the Puritans, had been frequently preferred) were cenſured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.
<hi>Here Mr.</hi> May <hi>is right, but yet partial, in that he does
not tell how that the Orthodox Clergy, as the Biſhops of</hi> Lincoln
Williams, <hi>Dr.</hi> Hall <hi>of</hi> Norwich, <hi>Dr.</hi> Prideaux <hi>of</hi> Worceſter, <hi>Dr.</hi>
Brownrig <hi>of</hi> Exeter, <hi>Dr.</hi> Morton <hi>of</hi> Durham, <hi>&amp;c. and all the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Anti-Arminian Heads of both Univerſities, and alſo Dr.</hi> Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon,
<hi>Dr.</hi> Featly, <hi>and many others, underwent the ſame Fate
with thoſe Miniſters which Mr.</hi> May <hi>ſpeaks of.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Pag. 38. which ſhould have been 24. Mr. <hi>May</hi> ſays, <hi>That the
Parliament ordered that the</hi> Scots <hi>ſhould be recompenſed for all their
Charges and Loſs by that miſchievous War which the King had raiſed
against them.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>May</hi> is not only partial and unſincere, but
the contrary hereof is true; for the <hi>Scots</hi> in the former War took
up Arms and ſeized the <hi>Regalia</hi> at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> took Towns in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and other ways committed Acts of Hoſtility before the King raiſed
Arms to ſuppreſs them, as is before; and ſo they did in this latter,
raiſe Arms in <hi>Scotland</hi> before they invaded <hi>England,</hi> before the
King raiſed any Army. <hi>[See</hi> Whitlock's Mem. <hi>fol. 276.]</hi> Where
Mr. <hi>May</hi> had this, unleſs framed by himſelf, I cannot tell; but
Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> recites the Demand at large, and the Commons
Anſwer to them. And this Mr. <hi>May</hi> ſpeaks of, is the ſixth De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<hi>Wherein they deſire, from the Juſtice and Kindneſs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of</hi> England, <hi>Reparations concerning the Loſſes which the Kingdom
of</hi> Scotland <hi>hath ſuſtained, and the vast Charges they have been put
unto, by occaſion of the late Troubles.</hi> To which the Commons
anſwer,</p>
                     <p>That the Houſe thinks fit, that a Friendly Aſſiſtance and Relief
ſhall be given towards the Supply of the Loſs of the <hi>Scots;</hi> and
that the Parliament did declare, that they did conceive that the
Sum of 300000 <hi>l.</hi> is a fit Proportion for their Friendly Aſſiſtance
and Relief, formerly thought fit to be given towards the Supply of
the Loſs and Neceſſities of their Brethren of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and that
the Houſes would in due time take into Conſideration the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how, and when the ſame ſhall be raiſed. <hi>Now let any Man
ſhew out of Mr.</hi> May, <hi>where that miſchievous War, which the King
had raiſed against them, is to be found.</hi> If Mr. <hi>May</hi> had been a
faithful Hiſtorian, he ſhould have made Truth, and not the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
of a diſtracted Time, nor the Clamours of his prejudic'd
Brain, to have been the Meaſures of his Story.</p>
                     <p>He ſhould have ſet forth, how like Pedlars they treated the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> in their Particulars in their <hi>8th</hi> Demand of 514128 <hi>l.—9 s.</hi>
beſides the Loſs of their Nation to 440000 <hi>l.</hi> Yet they did not
give in that Account with an Intent to demand a total Reparation
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:60932:147"/>
of all their Charges and Loſſes, but were content (good Men)
in ſome meaſure to bear a Remnant.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>May</hi> ſhould have ſet forth, how perfidiouſly the <hi>Scots</hi> dealt
with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, when in their Remonſtrance, at their
firſt coming in, they profeſſed, that they would take nothing of
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but for Money or Security; whereas they plundered
and taxed <hi>Northumberland, New-Caſtle,</hi> and the Biſhoprick of
<hi>Durham;</hi> ſo that thoſe Places could not recover their Loſſes in 20
Years, as Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudyard</hi> in open Parliament charged them:
and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> formerly eſtabliſhed the <hi>Scots</hi> Reformation at
their own bare Charges; whereas the <hi>Scots</hi> preſumed to require a
greater Sum than was ever given the King. Which you may read
more at large in Sir <hi>Rich. Baker,</hi> fol. 417.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the Parliament's Brethren, for whoſe Brotherly Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
they voted 300000 <hi>l.</hi> towards a Supply of the Loſſes and
Neceſſities (note that) of our Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that the
Parliament would in due time take into Conſideration the Manner
of raiſing, and Days of Payment; <hi>and in the mean time, leave</hi> New-Caſtle,
Northumberland, <hi>and</hi> Durham, <hi>a Prey to theſe devouring
Scots.</hi> But lame-footed Vengeance ſhall overtake this Fraternity,
and that by no viſible Power at preſent, but what ſhall ariſe from
among themſelves. I could add many more Particulars of
Mr. <hi>May</hi>'s Partiality and Inſincerity; but this already ſaid is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient:
And now it's time to enquire whether the King or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or both, deſigned the enſuing War, and who firſt deſigned
it; tho the Diſtemper of the Times was ſo diſtracted and varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that it's hard to judg of Intentions by Actions.</p>
                     <p>The Royaliſts excuſe the King from any Intention of a Civil
War in <hi>England,</hi> in that he protected no Man from the Juſtice of
the Parliament, and that he had put away all thoſe which the
Parliament called Evil Counſellors, both in Church and State, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made Mr. <hi>St. John</hi> his Attorney, and Mr. <hi>Holborn</hi> his Solicitor,
both which were his Antagoniſts in impoſing Ship-Money; and
upon his going into <hi>Scotland,</hi> made the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
and General of his Forces on this ſide <hi>Trent;</hi> and in the
Church reverſed all the Proceedings in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> againſt
the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and preferred Dr. <hi>Hall</hi> from <hi>Exeter</hi> to the
Biſhoprick of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and made Dr. <hi>Brownrig</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> who were the moſt Learned
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and moſt oppoſite to the Arminian Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
and of moſt exemplary Life and Piety; and before his going
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> paſſed all Bills preſented to him by the Houſes,
even that of not diſſolving the Parliament without their Conſent;
which he would never have done, if he had had any Intention of
raiſing a War againſt them, or a Civil War in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="287" facs="tcp:60932:147"/>
                        <hi>Mr.</hi> May, <hi>p. 43. it ſhould be</hi> p. 25. <hi>tells us of a twofold Treaſon
againſt the Parliament, (if you'll take his word) and that the
King was knowing of both; one was to have delivered the Earl
of</hi> Strafford <hi>out of the Tower, but Sir</hi> William Balfour <hi>the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
would not conſent to it: Here note,</hi> The King made <hi>Balfour,</hi>
a Scot, Lieutenant of the Tower, one of the greateſt Places of Truſt
in <hi>England,</hi> without any Complaint of the Parliament; whenas the
Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in their ſecond Demand made to the King,
would have no Stranger to command or inhabit in any Caſtles of the
King's without their Conſent.</p>
                     <p>The other part of this Treaſon, chief of all the reſt, <hi>(But why
all, when but two?)</hi> Mr. <hi>May</hi> ſays, was a Deſign to bring up the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, which was in the North, and not yet disbanded;
this Army they had dealt with to engage againſt the Parliament's
ſitting, and (as they alledg) to maintain the King's Prerogative,
Epiſcopacy, and other things againſt the Parliament it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>This Charge is ſo falſe, as well as partial, as no Man who had
any regard to Truth, Honeſty, or Fairneſs, would have ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
himſelf; for if the King's Prerogative be not maintain'd, he
can neither govern his Subjects nor protect them from Foreign
Enemies, and Epiſcopacy is one of the Conſtitutions of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and how the maintaining theſe can be againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
had need of a wiſer Head than Mr. <hi>May</hi>'s to ſhew: But theſe
two are not all Mr. <hi>May</hi> ſays, but there were other things againſt
the Parliament, (if there had been other things, I do not think
Mr. <hi>May</hi> would in Modeſty have conceal'd them); but ſince
Mr. <hi>May</hi> has not given the Cauſes of this chief Treaſon, I will do
it, and not follow Sir <hi>Richard Baker,</hi> nor <hi>Franklin,</hi> leſt they ſhould
be deemed to be partial to the King's Cauſe, but Mr. <hi>Whitlock,</hi>
whom no Man believes to be ſo, who, <hi>fol. 44. b.</hi> ſays,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>June</hi> 19th, It was voted that the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould receive 100000 l. of
the 300000 l. the <hi>Scots</hi> by a Paper pretended Neceſſity for 125000 l.
in preſent; the Parliament took off 10000 l. of 50000 l. which they
had appointed for the Engliſh Army, and order'd it for the Scots.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Lord</hi> Piercy, <hi>Commiſſary</hi> Wilmot <hi>and</hi> Aſhburnham <hi>(Members

ſoon do the like; <hi>and this cauſed the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Army to ſay,</hi> The
Parliament had diſobliged them.</p>
                     <p>The Officers put themſelves into a Juncto of ſworn Secrecy, and
drew up ſome Heads by way of Petition to the King and Parliament
<hi>for Money for the Army, and not to disband before the Scots;</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Biſhops Votes and Functions, and to ſettle the King's
Revenue.</p>

                        <pb n="288" facs="tcp:60932:148"/>
The Army tainted from hence, met and drew up a Letter or
Petition, which was ſhewed to the King, approv'd and ſigned by
him with <hi>C. R.</hi> and a Direction to Captain <hi>Leg,</hi> that none ſhould
ſee it but Sir <hi>Jacob Aſhley,</hi> (it ſhould have been <hi>Astly)</hi> the main
drift was, <hi>That the Army might be call'd up to attend the Safety of
the King's Perſon, and Parliament's Security; or that both Armies
might be disbanded.</hi> Where is this chief Treaſon lodg'd, unleſs in
Mr. <hi>May</hi>'s Brain? Or, where is the King's Prerogative mention'd?
But as the Times then went, Mr. <hi>May</hi> took liberty to ſay what he
liſt to humour them, the <hi>Scots</hi> muſt be obey'd in whatſoever they
demand, and it muſt be chief Treaſon in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to petition.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>May,</hi> p. 32, 33. will have the King's going into <hi>Scotland</hi> to
be a Deſign to raiſe War againſt the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and to
that end tells a Story of a <hi>Scots</hi> Writer, that publiſhed, that it
was to engage the <hi>Scots</hi> againſt the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> with
large Promiſes of Spoil, and offering Jewels of great Value for
Performance of it; but he names not the <hi>Scot,</hi> and leaves it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
for the Reader to judg by what fell out afterward: But if
he (the King) did, it was a matter of great Falſhood (Mr. <hi>May</hi>
ſays) having as yet declar'd no Enmity againſt the Engliſh Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:
From the ſame Author, he ſays, it was to make ſure
of thoſe Noblemen of that Kingdom he doubted of, as not willing
to ſerve his turn againſt <hi>England;</hi> and true it is, that about <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>
Letters came to the ſtanding Committee at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> that
a Treaſonable Plot was diſcovered there againſt the greateſt Peers
of the Kingdom, (but ſays not which Kingdom) upon which the
ſtanding Committee, fearing ſome Miſchief from the ſame Spring,
placed ſtrong Guards in divers Places of the City of <hi>London. But
in all this the Fox is the Finder, and Mr.</hi> May <hi>as partial and falſe as
in all he ſaid before.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The truth was, Jealouſies and Fears were fomented by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentarians,
and even by the Members themſelves, againſt the
King and Royaliſts: But Mr. <hi>Whitlock,</hi> tho of like Affection with
Mr. <hi>May,</hi> yet a much more impartial Repreſenter of the Actions of

without Reflection upon the King.</p>
                     <p>The Royaliſts charge the Parliament, at leaſt the Commons,
with a Deſign to raiſe War againſt the King, and to make him
odious to the People, after he had granted all the Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
of him, and given up thoſe whom they call'd evil Counſellors,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:60932:148"/>
to their Juſtice, for their Remonſtrance of the State of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
after the King's return out of <hi>Scotland:</hi> which becauſe of
the Extraordinarineſs of it we will recite it <hi>verbatim,</hi> as is ſaid by
Mr. <hi>Whitlock,</hi> f. 49. b.</p>
                     <p>The Houſe of Commons prepared a Remonſtrance of the State of
the Kingdom, wherein they mentioned <hi>All</hi> the Miſtakes, Misfortunes,
Illegalities and Defaults in Government ſince the King's coming to the
Crown, the evil Counſels and Counſellors, and a malignant Party;
that they have no hopes of ſettling the Diſtractions of this Kingdom
for want of a Concurrence with the Lords.</p>
                     <p>This Remonſtrance was ſomewhat roughly penn'd, both for the
Matter and Expreſſions in it, and met with great Oppoſition in
the Houſe, inſomuch as the Debate of it laſted from three a Clock
in the Afternoon till ten next Morning; and the ſitting up all
Night cauſed many of the Members, through Weakneſs or Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs,
to leave the Houſe, and Sir <hi>B. R.</hi> (I think he means
Sir <hi>Benj. Rudyard)</hi> to compare it to <hi>the Verdict of a ſtarv'd Jury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Vote was carried, tho not by many, to paſs the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance,
Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi> and two or three more, made their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
againſt this Remonſtrance, for which they were ſent to
the <hi>Tower.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Remonſtrance was preſently printed and publiſhed by the
Parliament, contrary to the King's Deſire, and before his Anſwer
made to it, which came forth ſhortly after to all the Heads of it.</p>
                     <p>Now let any ſhew a Precedent, when one State in Parliament ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
to the People, and arraigned the King, and the other two
States, unheard, and againſt the King's expreſs Deſire, and he ſhall
be my great <hi>Apollo.</hi> And if the End be firſt conſider'd in every
Action, what could be the End of publiſhing this Remonſtrance?
Or how could it tend to the ſettling the Diſtractions of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
I make this difference between <hi>Reproof</hi> and <hi>Reproach; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof</hi>
is privately to admoniſh another of ſuch Speeches and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as tend to the hurt of his Reputation and Fortune, ſo as this
other may avoid them for the future; <hi>Reproach</hi> is to divulge the
Speeches and Actions of another, to the leſſening of the Fame
and Credit of that other: <hi>Reproof</hi> is the Act of a Friend, <hi>Reproach</hi>
of an Enemy. And was this a time of day for the Commons
thus to reproach the King for his paſt Actions, after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
all their Grievances, and given up his Evil Counſellors to
their Juſtice? Or, was it ever known before, that when the King
had redreſſed Grievances, they ſhould be after rip'd up to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
him?</p>
                     <p>The firſt Effects of this Remonſtrance, Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi> mentions, is,
That during this time, and taking the opportunity from theſe
Differences between the King and Parliament, divers of the City
of the meaner ſort came in great Numbers and Tumults to <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi>
                        <pb n="290" facs="tcp:60932:149"/>
where, with many unſeemly and inſolent Words and Actions,
they incenſed the King, and went from thence in like Poſture to
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> behaving themſelves with extream Rudeneſs towards
ſome of the Members of both Houſes: and tho the King ſent to
the Lord Mayor to call a Common Council to prevent theſe rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Aſſemblies, yet I do not find the Commons took any Care
herein; and how theſe Actions of the Commons tended to ſettle
the Diſtractions of the Nation, or the Relief of <hi>Ireland,</hi> let any
impartial Man judg. But of all this Mr. <hi>May</hi> takes no notice, yet
does of the Parliament's petitioning the King for a Guard for the
Security of their Perſons, being informed of a Plot contrived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, (ſuch another as that of <hi>Scotland)</hi> and the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> to command it, which tho the King denied, he promiſed to
take care for their Safety.</p>
                     <p>Since Mr. <hi>May</hi> had no better luck with his <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Plot, he'll be
ſure of one now, by the King's entring into the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
attended by 300 Gentlemen, and ſeated in the Speaker's
Chair, and demanded five Members, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur
Haſlerig,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Stroud,</hi> to a fair Trial,
and would be as careful of their Privileges as ever any King of
<hi>England</hi> was. But in regard Mr. <hi>May</hi> is ſo ſhort and partial in this,
we'll ſtate the Caſe as reported by Mr. <hi>Whitlock,</hi> f. 50. <hi>a.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King being informed that ſome Members of Parliament had
private Meeting and Correſpondence with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and countenanced
the late Tumults from the City, he gave a Warrant to repair to their
Lodgings, and to ſeal up the Trunks, Studies and Chambers of the
Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur

                        <hi>This great Breach of Parliament-Privilege (Mr.</hi> May <hi>ſays) hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in a ſtrange time to divert the Kingdom from relieving</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:
And did not the Commons Remonſtrance againſt the King and
Houſe of Lords do ſo too? And when Men, eſpecially Princes, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
and defamed, regular Actions are not always conſequent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Cenſures of the King's Act was variouſly ſcanned by Men
of different Affections: The Royaliſts ſaid, Privilege of Parliament
extends not to Treaſon, Felony, or ſo much as Breach of the
Peace. And the Commons frame and publiſh a Declaration,</hi> That
there was never ſuch an unparallell'd Action of any King to the Breach
of all Freedom, not only in the Accuſation of their Members, ranſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſearching their Studies and Papers, and ſeeking to apprehend
their Perſons; but now in a Hoſtile Way, He <hi>(the King)</hi> threatned
the whole Body of the Houſe. <hi>This was</hi> Jan. 5. 1641.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And after the Commons publiſhed another Vote, That</hi> if any
arreſt a Member of Parliament by Warrant from the King only, it is
a Breach of Privilege; and that the coming of Papiſts and Souldiers
to the number of 500 armed Men <hi>(Mr.</hi> May <hi>ſays but 300, and
Mr.</hi> Whitlock <hi>ſays, with his Guard of Penſioners, and follow'd by
about 200 of his Courtiers)</hi> with the King to the Houſe, was a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
Deſign againſt the King and Parliament.</p>
                     <p>They vindicate the five Members, and declare, <hi>That a Paper
iſſued out for apprehending them, was falſe, ſcandalous, and illegal,</hi>
(How could they tell before they heard both Parties?) <hi>and they
ought to attend the Service of the Houſe, and require the Names of
thoſe who adviſed the King to iſſue out that Paper, and the Articles
againſt the five Members:</hi> Which if the King had done, they
would have been expoſed to more Violences of the Rabble than
thoſe which befel the Biſhops, and other Members of Parliament,
by a great Number of Perſons which came from the City to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
where they offered many Affronts to the Biſhops and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in a tumultuous manner. See <hi>Whit. Mem. f. 51. a.</hi> But of
this no notice was taken by the Commons or Lords that I can
find; ſo that as the Temper of the Times then went, it was a
notorious Breach of Privilege in the King to demand five Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to anſwer Articles of High-Treaſon, but none in the Rabble
in a tumultuous manner to affront and uſe Violence to the Biſhops
and others who were coming to do their Duties and Service in
Parliament.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſe Actions Mr.</hi> May, <hi>p. 41. calls</hi> petitioning by the Rabble,
and many times to utter rude Speeches againſt ſome Lords, whom they
conceived to be evil Adviſers of the King, which, however it was
meant, produced ill Conſequences to the Commonwealth, and did not
ſo much move the King to be ſenſible of his grieving the People, as
arm him with an Excuſe of leaving the Parliament and City for
fear of what might enſue upon ſuch tumultuous Concourſe of Men.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:60932:150"/>
                        <hi>And why was not this a reaſonable Excuſe for the King to leave
the Parliament and City, when they countenanced theſe Tumults,
and the King had not Power to ſuppreſs them?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mr.</hi> May <hi>goes on, and ſays,</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this ground twelve Biſhops at
that time abſenting themſelves, entred a Proteſtation againſt all Laws,
Votes and Orders, as <hi>Null,</hi> which in their Abſence ſhould paſs, by reaſon
they durſt not for fear of their Lives come to perform their Duties in
the Houſe, having been rudely menaced and aſſaulted. <hi>And why
might not the Biſhops enter ſuch Proteſtation? for if it be a Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im
in all Aſſemblies, that</hi> Plus valet contemptus unius, quam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſus
omnium, <hi>then does the Contempt and Affront of a whole
Order of Men, who have a Right of Suffrage, much more render
the Actions of the reſt invalid?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However, Mr. <hi>May</hi> goes on, and ſays, <hi>Whereupon it was agreed
by both Lords and Commons, that this Proteſtation of the Biſhops
was of dangerous Conſequence, and deeply entrenched upon the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
and Being of Parliaments; they were therefore accuſed of High-Treaſon,
apprehended, and committed Priſoners to the Tower.</hi> And
I ſay, a time ſhall come, when in Parliament theſe Men, who run
thus high againſt the Biſhops and eſtabliſhed Church of <hi>England,</hi>
ſhall be proſecuted by a contrary Extream, and the Church by
Law exalted higher than it was before.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>May</hi> goes on, and ſays, <hi>Thus was the Parliament daily
troubled with ill Work, whereby the Relief of</hi> Ireland <hi>was hindred.</hi>
If they were thus troubled, they may thank themſelves for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
theſe Troubles, as well by the Commons Remonſtrance
againſt the King and Lords, as by their countenancing the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults.
By this time things were ſo envenom'd, as would admit
of no Lenitives, eſpecially by the Commons; and the King went
from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and ſent a Meſſage to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and adviſes them, <hi>To digeſt into one Body all the Grievances
of the Kingdom, and ſend them to him, promiſing his favourable
Aſſent to thoſe Means which ſhould be found moſt effectual for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,
wherein he would not only equal, but excel the moſt indulgent
Princes.</hi> The Parliament thank'd him; but nothing but having
the <hi>Militia</hi> at their Diſpoſal would ſecure their Fears and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This was as new in</hi> England <hi>as the perpetuating the ſitting
of the Parliament; and if the King ſhould grant it, it would
be a total Subverſion of the Monarchy: For the Parliament
being perpetual, and having the Power of the</hi> Militia, <hi>the
Government muſt be either a Commonwealth, or an Oligarchy,
and the King inſignificant in it; yet have it the Parliament
would, notwithſtanding other Grievances, and the deplorable
State of</hi> Ireland: <hi>And therefore upon the</hi> 26th <hi>of</hi> February
<hi>they tell the King plainly,</hi> That the ſettling the Buſineſs of the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:60932:150"/>
Militia will admit no more Delay; and if his Majeſty ſhall ſtill refuſe to
agree with his two Houſes of Parliament in that Buſineſs, and ſhall
not be pleaſed upon their humble Advice to do what they deſire therein,
that then for the Safety of his Majeſty, of Themſelves, and the whole
Kingdom, and to preſerve the Peace thereof, and to prevent future
Fears and Jealouſies, they ſhall be conſtrained of themſelves, without
his Majeſty, to ſettle that neceſſary Buſineſs of the Militia. <hi>See</hi> Whit.
M. f. 54. a.</p>
                     <p>Here 'tis obſervable, That as the King feigned a Neceſſity to
raiſe Ship-money for the Good and Safety of the Kingdom in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
when the whole Kingdom is in danger; the Judges gave
their Opinion, That the King may by his Writ under the Broad
Seal of <hi>England,</hi> command all his Subjects of this Kingdom to
provide and furniſh ſuch Number of Ships, with Men, Victuals,
and Ammunition, and for ſuch time as the King ſhall think fit,
for the Defence and Safeguard of the Kingdom from ſuch Peril
and Danger; and that by Law the King may compel the doing
thereof, in Caſe of Refuſal and Refractorineſs; and that in ſuch
Caſe the King is ſole Judg, both of the Danger, and when and
how the ſame may be prevented and avoided: So now the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
pretending a Neceſſity for the Safety of the King and of
Themſelves, and the whole Kingdom, and to preſerve the Peace
thereof, will tear the Militia from him. In this State things could
not ſtand long at a Stay.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>May, p.</hi> 47. will have the Queen's going into <hi>Holland</hi> with
her Daughter, and carrying with her the Crown-Jewels of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and pawning them there, whereby ſhe bought Arms for the
War which enſued, that it was then deſigned by the King againſt
the Parliament: but if Mr. <hi>May</hi> had been ſincere, he ſhould have told
too, as Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi> does, <hi>f. 59. a.</hi> how the Parliament took
100000 <hi>l.</hi> of the 400000 <hi>l.</hi> they voted to be raiſed for <hi>Ireland;</hi> and
whether this was not for the War which enſued in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mr.</hi> May, p. 48. <hi>recites three Votes of Parliament,</hi> 1. That the
King's Abſence ſo far remote <hi>(being then at</hi> York) from his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is not only an Obſtruction, but may be a Deſtruction to the Affairs
in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. That when the Lords and Commons in Parliament, ſhall declare
what the Law of the Land is; to have this not only queſtioned and
controverted, but contradicted, and a Command that it ſhould not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,
is a high Breach of the Privilege of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>That they who adviſed the King to abſent himſelf from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
are Enemies to the Peace of this Kingdom, and juſtly to be
ſuſpected to be Favourites of the Rebellion in</hi> Ireland. But Mr. <hi>May</hi>
ſhould have added, that it is not the King's Preſence in <hi>London,</hi> or
any other Place, but his aſſenting to Bills preſented to him, which
he may do by Commiſſion as well as Perſonally, that enacts them
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:60932:151"/>
into Laws; and that the King after he went from <hi>London,</hi> paſſed
the Bill for taking away the Biſhops Votes in Parliament, and that
no Clergy-Man ſhould exerciſe any Temporal Juriſdiction; which
the King did with remorſe enough, and only to humour and appeaſe
the Temporal Lords and Commons in Parliament; and the Biſhops in
Parliament are one of the 3 States of <hi>England.</hi> The King more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
in his Abſence, upon a Motion by the Parliament, put Sir
<hi>John Byron</hi> from being Lieutenant of the Tower, and Sir <hi>John
Conniers</hi> to ſucceed him; and refers the Conſideration of the
Government, and Liturgy of the Church, wholly to the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
ſee <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s <hi>M. f. 53. b.</hi> But nothing leſs than the King's
parting with the Militia would ſatisfy the Parliament, which the
King would not part from: ſo now it's left fair for indifferent
Men to judg, whether the King or Parliament, or both, deſigned
the enſuing War. And to proceed to ſet forth who began it.</p>
                     <p>I have ſaid in the firſt Page of this King's Reign, or p. 153, That
the firſt Fifteen Years of it were perfectly <hi>French,</hi> and ſuch as
were never before ſeen or heard of in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; this
brought on a miſerable War in all the Three Kingdoms of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Deſtruction upon the King, <hi>when
is was not in the Power of thoſe which firſt raiſed the War againſt him,
to ſave his Life, which they would have done.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I am told, that the laſt Part of this Paragraph, is an unjuſt
Charge upon the Parliament, in that they acted defenſively in this
War, and that the King firſt raiſed Arms; and this by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Mr. <hi>May.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If I be miſtaken, I have the Authority of him who could beſt
know; I mean the King at his Death, who declared,</hi> That he never did
begin the War with the two Houſes of Parliament, as all the World
knows; that they began with him; it was the Militia they began up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
they confeſt that to be his, but they thought fit to have it from him:
and to be ſhort, if any body will look into the Dates of thoſe Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
theirs and his, and likewiſe to the Declarations, they will ſee
clearly, that they began theſe unhappy Troubles, not he. <hi>See</hi> Whit.
Mem. <hi>f. 369. a. and all the Writers of thoſe times.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If this be not Authority ſufficient to ſhew the Parliament began
the War; the firſt Scuffle between the King and Parliament, was
about the Buſineſs of <hi>Hull,</hi> where the Parliament had committed
the Charge of the Town and Magazine to Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> one
of the Members of the Commons, who was ſent down thither to
remove the Magazine to <hi>London:</hi> but the Country of <hi>York</hi> petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it might ſtill remain at <hi>Hull,</hi> for ſecuring the <hi>Northern</hi> Parts,
eſpecially the King reſiding there.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon the King taking a Guard of his Servants and ſome
Neighbouring Gentry, upon the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>April</hi> went to <hi>Hull,</hi> but
contrary to Expectation, found the Gates ſhut, and the Bridges
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:60932:151"/>
drawn up, by Sir <hi>John,</hi> and his Entrance denied, though but
with 20 Horſe; which ſo moved the King, that he proclaimed
<hi>Hotham</hi> a Traitor, and ſends to the Parliament for Juſtice againſt
him.</p>
                     <p>To this the Parliament return no Anſwer; but juſtify Sir <hi>John
Hotham,</hi> and order that the Sheriffs and Juſtices of the Peace
do ſuppreſs all Forces which ſhall be raiſed, or gathered together
againſt <hi>Hull,</hi> or to diſturb the Peace; nor did they ſtay here, but
put the Power of the Militia in Perſons nominated by them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the King in ordering any thing together with them; and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
<hi>Hotham,</hi> by his Warrants, to raiſe the trained Bands in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
to march with their Arms into <hi>Hull,</hi> where he diſarmed them,
and turned them home again. See <hi>Whit. Mem. f.</hi> 55, 56. So I
ſubmit this to Judgment, whether this was not raiſing Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King, being done by Subjects, and contrary to the King's
Command; and if the King did encreaſe his Guards, yet this was
ſubſequent to the excluding the King from having Power in the
Militia, and <hi>Hotham</hi>'s Raiſing Arms, and Diſarming the Trained
Bands of <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>May</hi> ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 55. the Parliament being then intent upon
ſettling the Militia by Land, took care alſo to ſeize the Navy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Hands, and ordered the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> to be Admiral, to
put this in Execution: but the King had choſen Sir <hi>John Penning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
to that place inſtead of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and ſent
a Command to the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> to reſign the Place to him
<hi>(Pennington:)</hi> But the Earl choſe rather to obey the Ordinance of
Parliament, and with great Courage and Policy got the Fleet into
his Hands, tho many of the Captains ſtood out againſt him; but
the Earl deprived them of their Commands, and poſſeſt himſelf
of the Ships, taking ſhortly after another Ship called the <hi>Lyon,</hi> of
great Import, coming out of <hi>Holland</hi> and laden with Gun-power,
which proved a great Addition to his Strength. So here was a
double Beginning of the War by the Parliament, both in ſeizing
the Fleet, and taking the <hi>Lyon,</hi> and this before the King commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any Act of Hoſtility.</p>
                     <p>And for the carrying on this War, (which Mr. <hi>May</hi> calls the
Cauſe) the Parliament upon the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> made an Order
for bringing in Money and Plate, to raiſe Arms for the Cauſe, and
the Publick Faith for Repayment to them which brought it in.
So here the Parliament raiſed Money, as well as Forces, for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the War, before the King levied any: And ſo I leave it
to Judgment who firſt began the War.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Objection.</hi> The Parliament raiſed Arms for their own Defence, and
Security of the Nation.</p>

                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This is ſaid, but of no kin to Truth or Reaſon: for
Men defend what they are poſſeſt of, and the King was poſſeſt of
the Militia and Fleet, when the Parliament raviſh'd both from
him; nor did the King uſe either againſt the Parliament, when
they invaded them. Beſides, the King (at leaſt, as he declared)
endeavoured to defend the eſtabliſhed Religion, and Laws of the
Land; whereas the Parliament contended to aboliſh the Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
Religion, and to exalt themſelves above the Laws of the
Land.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Objection</hi> 2. That the King had ſo often violated the Laws and
Conſtitutions of the Nation, and governed ſo Arbitrarily, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
could have no Security for the future to prevent his ſo doing
again, ſo long as the King was poſſeſt of the Militia.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The Caſe was not the ſame then, when the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to have no more Parliaments, as now, when the King had
made this Parliament perpetual, and had paſſed the Triennial Bill,
for Parliaments to meet whether he would or no: And tho Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
and Flatterers inſtill'd thoſe things into the King, when they
were without any Fear or Apprehenſion of being queſtioned by a
Parliament, yet now the Parliament had ſo ſeverely proſecuted
and puniſhed ſuch Men, and being perpetual, or at leaſt to meet
Three Years after every Diſſolution, none would preſume to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
the King in things derogatory to his Honour, and the Intereſt
of the Nation. And now we proceed to the enſuing War.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Parliament, before the King ſet up his Standard at</hi> Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Aug. 22, <hi>Voted,</hi> That an Army ſhould be raiſed for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the King and Parliament; that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſhould be
Captain General of the Army, and the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> General of
the Horſe.</p>
                     <p>The War began firſt between the Marqueſs of <hi>Hartford</hi> for the
King in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> for the Parliament;
the Earl being worſted by the Marqueſs at <hi>Sherborn-Caſtle. Goring</hi>
got into <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and held it for the King; but could not hold
it long, for the Country joining with Sir <hi>John Meyrick,</hi> forced him
to ſurrender, who thereupon went into <hi>Holland;</hi> and my Lord
<hi>Say, St. Johns,</hi> and <hi>Weemen,</hi> with Colonel <hi>Whitlock,</hi> enter <hi>Oxford,</hi>
and keep it for the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>But the Face of Affairs ſoon changed; for the King having
made the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> his General, and the Parliament the
Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> upon the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>October</hi> the Armies met, and
fought at <hi>Edghil,</hi> with uncertain Victory, which both ſides claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> was mortally wounded, and taken Priſoner;
the Right Wing of the King's Horſe, commanded by Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert,</hi>
brake the Left Wing of Horſe of the Parliament's, which
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:60932:152"/>
Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> purſued too far, tho with great Slaughter; but the
King's left Wing of Horſe was broken by Sir <hi>William Balfour,</hi>
Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Fielding.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However the Victory was uncertain, the Succeſs was not ſo,
for the King took <hi>Banbury</hi> Town and Caſtle, and <hi>Oxford;</hi> and
Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> took my Lord <hi>Say</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Brought,</hi> and made Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions
near <hi>London:</hi> whereupon the Parliament recalled <hi>Eſſex</hi> to
defend themſelves.</p>
                     <p>And it was time, for the King was marching towards <hi>London,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Henley;</hi> and at <hi>Brentford</hi> both Armies
fought, <hi>Eſſex</hi> being aſſiſted by the Trained Bands and Apprentices
of <hi>London,</hi> and the King was forced to retreat; and if <hi>Eſſex</hi> had
followed, in all Appearance the King would have loſt his Army,
not having Bullet enough to have maintained one quarter of an
Hour's Fight: and towards the latter end of the Year, Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert</hi>
ſtorms <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> and puts many of my Lord <hi>Stamford</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Sword, and took 1100 Priſoners, which were uſed
with great Barbarity; and Colonel <hi>Nathaniel Fines,</hi> in the <hi>West,</hi>
was routed by Prince <hi>Rupert;</hi> and in the North, Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi>
was beaten by the Forces commanded by the Earl of <hi>Cumberland,</hi>
Sir <hi>Fran. Worſley,</hi> Sir <hi>Marm. Langdale,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Glenham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Year there was a Treaty of Peace at <hi>Oxford;</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
Propoſitions were, That the King ſhould disband his Army,
return to the Parliament, leave Delinquents to Trial, and Papiſts
to be disbanded.</p>
                     <p>That a Bill be brought in for aboliſhing Epiſcopacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
ſuch other Bills as ſhould be preſented for Reformation; Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants
to abjure Papacy, to remove malignant Counſellors, to ſettle
the Militia as the Parliament deſired, to prefer to Offices ſuch as
the Parliament ſhould name, and to take in all that were put out
of Commiſſions of the Peace.</p>
                     <p>A Bill to vindicate the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> and five Members; to
enter into Alliances for the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and to grant a general Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
excepting to the Earl of <hi>New-Caſtle, Digby,</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>To reſtore Parliament-Members to their Offices, and to reſtore
their Loſſes.</p>
                     <p>The King propoſed,</p>
                     <p>That his Revenue, Magazines, Ships, and Forts, be reſtored;
That what had been done contrary to Law and the King's Right
may be recalled; That all illegal Power claimed, or acted by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Parliament, be diſclaimed: And as the King will conſent
to the Execution of all Laws concerning Popery and Reformation,
ſo he deſires a Bill for preſerving the Common-Prayer againſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries;
that all Perſons excepted againſt by this Treaty, may be
tried <hi>per Pares,</hi> with a Ceſſation of Arms, and a free Trade.</p>

This Treaty began <hi>March</hi> 4. 1642, and broke off <hi>April</hi> 15. fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
<hi>viz.</hi> 1643. But this is obſervable in this fickle King,
that four Days before the Treaty broke off, the King ſaid, he was
fully ſatisfied, and promiſed to give the Parliament-Commiſſioners
his Anſwer in Writing, according to their Deſires; but becauſe it
was paſt Midnight, he would have it drawn up in Writing, and
give it them in the Morning: but inſtead thereof, the King gave
them a Paper quite contrary to what was concluded the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<hi>Whitlock</hi>'s <hi>Mem.</hi> fol. 65. a.</p>
                     <p>The Treaty of Peace thus broke off, both ſides proceed in War.
The Queen this Year, about the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> landed at <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>
in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> from <hi>Holland,</hi> having avoided a Squadron of
Men of War deſigned by the Parliament to intercept her, and
brought abundance of Arms, and about 3000 Soldiers, and was
proclaimed Traitor by the Parliament, and after joined with the
King and his Army at <hi>Edg-Hill</hi> in <hi>Warwickſhire.</hi> And if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
proſpered ſo ill laſt Year, they ſucceeded worſe this; for
the Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi> enters <hi>Litchfield,</hi> and drives the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
Forces into the Cloſe; and after that defeats Sir <hi>John Gell,</hi>
and Sir <hi>W. Brereton,</hi> but the Earl was ſlain at the Head of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
and the Earl of <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> in the North, overthrew the
Parliament's Forces commanded by Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> at <hi>Bradforth;</hi>
and Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> is defeated in the Weſt; Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>
takes <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and Prince <hi>Maurice, Exeter, Biddiford, Barnſtable,
Appleford,</hi> and <hi>Dartmouth:</hi> The great <hi>Hambden</hi> is routed, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
wounded at <hi>Chalgrave Field</hi> by Prince <hi>Rupert.</hi> And now
the King had two conquering Armies in the North and Weſt, and
the Parliament none conſiderable to oppoſe either; ſo that if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King, or the Marqueſs of <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> had marched to
<hi>London,</hi> in all Appearance either Army would have found little
Oppoſition: but inſtead hereof, the King ſits down and beſieges
<hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> comes before <hi>Hull.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This gave the Parliament an Opportunity to recruit <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and to enter into a Treaty to procure the <hi>Scots</hi> to bring an
Army into <hi>England</hi> again for to aſſiſt the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>In this Treaty a double Conſideration is remarkable; firſt, The
Inſtability of humane Actions, which are founded in Paſſion and
Prejudice, for there was but one Year between this Treaty and
the National Proteſtation by the Parliament, to <hi>Maintain the true
Proteſtant Religion, expreſſed in the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
(which Paſſage Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi> in his <hi>Memoirs,</hi> fol. 43. has left
out) and according to their Duty and Allegiance, to maintain and
defend his Majeſty's Royal Perſon and Eſtate, the Privileges of
Parliament, and Liberties of the Subjects, and to preſerve the
Union between the Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi>
and this to be taken by all <hi>Engliſh-men:</hi> but now the <hi>Scots</hi> would
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:60932:153"/>
not ſtir one Step, unleſs the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> would join
with them in their Covenant, which ill agreed with their Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which the Parliament ſubmitted to.</p>
                     <p>The other, was a Diſcovery of a Spark, which ſoon after broke
out into ſuch a Flame, as conſumed the Covenant, Presbytery, the
Parliament, King, and Church and State of <hi>England;</hi> for tho du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Proſperity of the King's Affairs this Fire was covered,
yet when young Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> (who was one of the Parliament's
Commiſſioners, and one who loved the Presbyterian Government
no better than the Epiſcopal) ſaw that the Parliament would <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the Scotiſh</hi> Covenant and Diſcipline, he ſtifly oppoſed it
ſingly, and at laſt carry'd it, that the Nations ſhould join in a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
League: and the <hi>Scots</hi> would have Church-Government to
be according to the Example of the beſt Reformed Churches; but
Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> inſiſted to have it according to the Word of God
only, and carried both points. Afterwards, one of Sir <hi>Henry</hi>'s
Fellows expoſtulated with him, why he ſhould put them to ſo
much Trouble about ſuch needleſs Trifles? Sir <hi>Henry</hi> anſwer'd, He
was miſtaken, and did not ſee far enough into the matter; for a
League ſhewed it was between two Nations, and might be broken
upon juſt Reaſons, but not a Covenant; and that Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
according to the Word of God, by the Difference of Divines
and Expoſitors, would be long enough before it were determined,
for the learnedſt held it clearly for Epiſcopacy; ſo that when all
agreed, we may take in the <hi>Scots</hi> Presbytery. See the Life of
General <hi>Monk,</hi> p. 23, 24. written by his Chaplain Dr. <hi>Gumble.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Parliament having recruited the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Army, he
forced his Paſſage, and relieved <hi>Gloceſter;</hi> the King's Army retreat
to <hi>Newbury,</hi> where it was charged by <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and worſted; and in
the Fight, the Ornament of the Age, the learned and moſt inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> tho weary of his Life, and preſaging his own
Deſtiny, was ſlain, as were the Earls of <hi>Sunderland</hi> and <hi>Carnarven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the King's Army had ſuch bad Succeſs before <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> my
Lord of <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> had worſe before <hi>Hull;</hi> for lying in a mooriſh
unhealthy place, in a ſickly ſeaſon of the Year, <hi>viz. September</hi>
and <hi>October,</hi> the whole Army fell into Fluxes and other Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
ſo as they were forced to raiſe the Siege, having done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
conſiderable in it: beſides, at this time <hi>Lyn-Regis</hi> in <hi>Norfolk</hi>
(a Place near as conſiderable as <hi>Hull)</hi> was ſeized by the Gentry
of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and might have been relieved, if <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> had not
been engaged in beſieging <hi>Hull.</hi> Tho the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
agreed in their Solemn League and Covenant, yet ſo did
not Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> and his Son with the Preferment of Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Fairfax</hi> and others in the <hi>North,</hi> ſo that Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſerve under <hi>Fairfax.</hi> Hereupon the Parliament intended to
have diſplaced <hi>Hotham;</hi> which when he heard of, both he and his
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:60932:154"/>
Son treated with the Marqueſs of <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> to deliver <hi>Hull</hi> to the
King; and the Parliament ſuſpecting the Deſign, ſent Sir <hi>Matthew
Bromton</hi> (Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Brother-in-law) to ſeize both Father and
Son: which Sir <hi>John</hi> little ſuſpecting till it was too late, fled to
<hi>Beverly,</hi> where he was ſeized by his own Soldiers, and carried to
<hi>Hull,</hi> from whence Sir <hi>Matthew</hi> ſent both Father and Son to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
where ſoon after both loſt their Heads.</p>
                     <p>When the Parliament ſent Commiſſioners to invite the <hi>Scots</hi> to
come to their Aſſiſtance, the King ſent Letters to diſſwade them
from it, urging the manifold Grants he had given to them when
he was in <hi>Scotland</hi> laſt, which compleated all they could ask; and
their ſolemn Proteſtations to be for ever his Majeſty's moſt obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Subjects. See the Act cited by Sir <hi>Rich. Baker,</hi> fol. 514. <hi>That
it ſhould be deteſtable Treaſon in the highest degree, for any of the</hi> Scots
<hi>Nation, conjunctly or ſingly, to raiſe Arms or any military Force upon
any Cauſe whatever, without the King's Commiſſion.</hi> But now, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provoked
by the King, and againſt his expreſs Command, they in
open Hoſtility enter <hi>England</hi> a ſecond time againſt him; ſo little
Faith or Honour was to be truſted to from theſe Covenanters:
for the <hi>Scots</hi> having made their Market with the King, reſolve to
improve it with the Parliament, and beſides their Pay, or Wages
of Iniquity, will have the Covenant and Kirk-Government impoſed
upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as well as <hi>Scots</hi> Nation; and tho the King's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were ſigned by 19 Lords, the <hi>Scots</hi> ordered them to be burnt by
the common Hangman; and in order hereunto, General <hi>Leſley,</hi> now
Earl of <hi>Leven,</hi> upon the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> enters into <hi>England</hi> again,
with an Army of above 20000 <hi>Scots.</hi> The King, to add Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his Arms, ſummoned the Members of Parliament which
followed him, to meet at <hi>Oxford</hi> upon the <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> where
they voted the coming of the <hi>Scots</hi> to be Treaſon and Rebellion:
but becauſe they would not come up to the King's Deſire, in Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Members at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to be no Parliament, the King, in
great Diſpleaſure with them, and in his Letters to the Queen, calls
them his mungrel Parliament; ſuch was the Kindneſs the King
ſhewed thoſe Noble Lords and Gentry for ſacrificing their Lives
and Fortunes for his Service. And to oppoſe the <hi>Scots,</hi> the King
makes a Ceſſation of Arms with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and draws back into
<hi>England</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> which he ſent to oppoſe the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> but theſe
were every where beaten, 1500 of them caſt away by Sea, and the
greateſt Body of them commanded by Sir <hi>Michael Ernley,</hi> Major
General <hi>Gibſon,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Boteler,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Monk</hi> (who ſhall
unravel all the Parliament and <hi>Scots</hi> were now weaving) were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
routed and diſperſed by Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> joining with
Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> near <hi>Nantwich;</hi> and all theſe, with Colonel
<hi>Gibs, Harmon,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Dawns,</hi> with 14 Captains, 26 Enſigns,
and other inferiour Officers, and 1500 common Soldiers, taken
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:60932:154"/>
Priſoners, with the loſs of their Cannon and Baggage: So that,
as Serjeant <hi>Whitlock</hi> obſerves, <hi>f. 79. a.</hi> theſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> never did the
King any conſiderable Service. But to ſweeten this, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>
at the cloſe of this Year beat Sir <hi>John Meldrum</hi> a <hi>Scot,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
<hi>Newark,</hi> and his Army ſurrendred up their Arms: Upon
which the Parliament-Gariſons in <hi>Gainsborow, Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Sleford,</hi>
quitted theſe Places to the King's Forces. And here we will end
the Year 1643. and take notice how Mr. Serjeant <hi>Whitlock,</hi> f. 64. <hi>b.</hi>
errs in point of Time, where he ſays the <hi>Scots</hi> paſſed the <hi>Tyne</hi> in
1642, under General <hi>Leſley</hi> to aſſiſt the Parliament; and <hi>f. 67. a.</hi>
he ſays, the Queen was brought to Bed at <hi>Exeter</hi> of the Princeſs
<hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> (which for ought appears, was before the Queen
landed from <hi>Holland)</hi> for ſhe was born the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1644.

as they ſtood in the beginning of this Year: <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>
are united in one <hi>Solemn League</hi> and <hi>Covenant;</hi> in <hi>January</hi> laſt,
<hi>Leſley</hi> (or <hi>Leven)</hi> enter'd <hi>England</hi> with an Army of 18000 Foot,
and 3500 Horſe and Dragoons, and ſoon after the Earl of <hi>Calendar</hi>
enter'd <hi>England</hi> with an Army of 10000 <hi>Scots</hi> more; theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

Armies were commanded by as brave and reſolute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
as were to be found in <hi>Europe:</hi> The Fleet wholly at the

ſtrong and laſting.</p>
                     <p>And all this time you hear little of <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> more than
that he was a Captain of Horſe, and being of a bold and active
Spirit, ſecured the Town of <hi>Cambridg</hi> for the Parliament, and
was very diligent in obſtructing ſeveral Levies for the King in
<hi>Cambridgſhire, Eſſex, Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Norfolk:</hi> For theſe Services he had
a Commiſſion to be a Colonel of Horſe, and having an inſinuating
and canting way of preaching, and ſeeming very Godly, raiſed
ſuch a Regiment of Horſe as was no where to be found; the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
ſpirited with Zeal to the Cauſe, yet not of the <hi>Scots</hi> mode:
and to ſecure them without, <hi>Oliver</hi> took care to provide them
able Horſes, and to be well arm'd and accoutred; ſo as every one
of them, beſide Sword and Piſtol, had Pot, Back and Breaſt, Muſquet-proof.</p>
                     <p>He was Nephew to Sir <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> who had a very great
Eſtate, but his Father being a younger Brother, had not above
300 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> as was ſaid. Their Name originally was not
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60932:155"/>
                        <hi>Cromwel,</hi> but <hi>Williams,</hi> and the Name of <hi>Cromwel</hi> was by this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident:
When <hi>Cromwel</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> fell, in the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.
he had <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Anceſtor in his Service, who was a Perſon of
lively Parts, and induſtrious in Buſineſs, which <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. obſerving,
took him into his Sereice, but upon all occaſions call'd him <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel;</hi>
and the King being ask'd the Reaſon, anſwer'd, <hi>He call'd
him ſo in</hi> Cromwel's <hi>time, and would continue to call him ſo ſtill;</hi>
and this continued down to Sir <hi>Oliver</hi>'s, and our <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s time.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Oliver</hi> being of a turbulent and aſpiring Diſpoſition, his
Father's contracted Fortunes could not ſupport his Extravagancies,
whereby he was like to have fallen into thoſe Troubles which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
attend ſuch Follies; and to prevent them he ſets up for <hi>New-England,</hi>
where he becomes a moſt zealous Promoter of their Cauſe:
But this could not long continue him there; for in their firſt plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves they were poor, ſo as he could not find Means and
Opportunity to ſupport his Extravagancies, and ſo back he came
again into <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About the Year 1638, the Undertakers to drain the Fen-Lands
in <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> ſet up; this Undertaking was
mainly oppoſed by the Town of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> fearing it would ſpoil
their Navigation between <hi>Cambridg</hi> and <hi>Lyn-Regis,</hi> whence <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg</hi>
was ſupplied with Sea-Coal, Wine and other Proviſions.</p>
                     <p>When the Writs were iſſued out for calling the ſecond Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in 1640, <hi>Oliver</hi> ſets up to be choſen Burgeſs for the Town
of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> aſſuring them that if he were choſen, he would make
it his Buſineſs to overthrow the Project of draining the Fens.
But tho by this Project he got to be choſen, yet after he became
Protector he moſt induſtriouſly promoted the Project of draining
the Fens.</p>
                     <p>But tho <hi>Cromwel</hi> was of a turbulent and aſpiring Spirit, yet
before the Civil Wars broke out in <hi>England,</hi> he was not conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
in any Military Diſcipline, nor indeed of any other Learning,
or juſt or lawful Calling: His Perſon was of a robuſt and coarſe
Complexion, his Face red, ſo was his Noſe, (I fancy like the
Roman General <hi>Sylla</hi>'s) great and ſtraked with blew Veins. In
promoting his Cauſe and Intereſt he was moſt induſtrious and
indefatigable: Theſe Qualities were obſerved and feared by ſome
both of the King's and Parliament's Party, before they came to be
publickly known and put in Execution. I'll give an Inſtance or
two hereof.</p>
                     <p>When the King ſummoned the Members of Parliament of his
Party to meet at <hi>Oxford</hi> in <hi>January</hi> laſt, <hi>Williams</hi> Arch-biſhop of
<hi>York</hi> was likewiſe ſummoned, with whom the King privately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
what Courſe was beſt to be taken in the preſent Circumſtances
of his Affairs: the Arch-biſhop adviſed him by all means to come
to an Agreement with the Parliament; for ſince the <hi>Scots</hi> were
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:60932:155"/>
come into <hi>England</hi> in ſuch numerous Armies, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of
the Parliament's Party in theſe two laſt Years having acquired a
Military Knowledg, it would in all appearance be impoſſible for
the King long to withſtand their Forces; but above all, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
the King to get <hi>Cromwel</hi> over to his ſide, if poſſible;
otherways to take him off by any means, or he would be the
King's Ruin; as you may read more at large in the ſecond Part of
the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield</hi>'s Life of <hi>Williams.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor was <hi>Cromwel</hi> leſs terrible to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and the
<hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners, than to the King's Party; ſo that one Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Earl and ſeveral of his Confidents, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi>
Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton</hi> and Sir <hi>John Meyrick,</hi> and others, with the
<hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners, were in Conſultation how to get rid of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi>
and ſent to Serjeant <hi>Whitlock</hi> and <hi>Maynard</hi> about it, who
came, and <hi>Eſſex</hi> told them, that he ſent for them to have their
Advice and Counſel upon a Matter of great Importance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
both Kingdoms; in which the Lords Commiſſioners of
<hi>Scotland</hi> are concerned for their Kingdom, as we for ours, and
they as well as we know your Abilities and Integrity, and are
deſirous of your Counſel in this great Buſineſs; which both the
Serjeants promiſed faithfully to give. But here take notice, That
as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament call'd thoſe who were oppoſite to them
<hi>Malignants,</hi> ſo the <hi>Scots</hi> call'd thoſe oppoſite to them <hi>Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the Deſire of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Chancellor of <hi>Scotland (Lowden)</hi>

                              <hi>I</hi> Can aſſure you of the great Opinion both my Brethren and ſelf
have of your Worth and Abilities, elſe we ſhould not have deſired
this Meeting with you: And ſince it is his Excellency's <hi>(Eſſex</hi> his)
Pleaſure, that I ſhould acquaint you with the Matter upon whilk your
Counſel is deſired, I ſhall obey his Commands, and briefly recite the
Buſineſs to you.</p>
                           <p>You ken vary weele that Gen. Lieutenant <hi>Cromwel</hi> is no Friend of
ours; and ſince the Advance of our Army into <hi>England,</hi> he has uſed
all under-hand and cunning Means to take off from our Honour, and
the Merits of this Kingdom, an evil Requital of all our Hazards
and Services; but ſo it is, and we are nevertheleſs fully ſatisfied of
the Affections and Gratitude of the gude People of the Nation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                           <p>It is thought requiſite for us, and for carrying on the Cauſe of the
twa Kingdoms, that this Obſtacle or Remora be removed out of the
way, whom we foreſee will be no ſmall Impediment to us in the gude
Deſign we have undertaken.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="304" facs="tcp:60932:156"/>
He not only is no Friend to us and the Government of our Church, but
he is alſo no well-willer to his Excellency, whom you and we have all
Cauſe to love and honour; and if he be permitted to go on this way, it
may, I fear, endanger the whole Buſineſs; therefore we are to adviſe
of ſome Courſe to be taken for Prevention of this Miſchief.</p>
                           <p>You ken vary weele the Accord betwixt the twa Nations, and the
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion by the ſolemn League and Covenant; and if any be an Incendiary
between the twa Nations, how he is to be proceeded againſt. Now the
Matter is wherein we deſire your Opinions, what you take the meaning
of the Word <hi>Incendiary</hi> to be, and whether the Lieutenant General
be not ſike an Incendiary, as is meant thereby; and whilk Way wad
be beſt to proceed againſt him, if he be proved ſike an Incendiary, and
that we may clepe his Wings from ſoaring to the Prejudice of our Caſe.</p>
                           <p>Now you may ken, That by our Law in <hi>Scotland,</hi> we clepe him an
<hi>Incendiary,</hi> wha kindleth Coals of Contention, and raiſeth Differences
in the State, to the Publick Damage; and he is <hi>Tanquam Publicus
Hoſtis Patriae.</hi> Whether your Law be the ſame or not, you ken beſt,
who are mickle learned therein, and therefore we deſire your Judgment
in theſe Points.</p>

                     </floatingText>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi> anſwered firſt, and after a ſhort Preface ſaid, The
Senſe of the Word <hi>Incendiary</hi> is the ſame with us as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
has expreſſed to be by the Law of <hi>Scotland, One that raiſeth
the Fire of Contention in a State, that kindleth burning hot Flames
of Contention;</hi> and ſo it is taken in the Accord of the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
                     <p>Whether Lieutenant Gen. <hi>Cromwel</hi> be ſuch an <hi>Incendiary</hi> between
the two Kingdoms as is meant by this Word, cannot be known but
by Proofs of his particular Words and Actions, tending to the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of this Fire of Contention between the two Nations, and the
raiſing of Difference between us.</p>
                     <p>If it do not appear by Proofs he has done this, he is not an
<hi>Incendiary;</hi> but if it can be made out by Proofs, that he hath
done this, then he is an <hi>Incendiary,</hi> and to be proceeded againſt
for it by the Parliament, upon his being thus accuſed for thoſe
things.</p>
                     <p>This I take for a Ground, That my Lord General and Lords
Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being of ſo great Honour and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
as you are, muſt not appear in any Buſineſs, eſpecially of
an Accuſation, but ſuch as you ſhall ſee before-hand clearly will
be made out, and be brought to the Effect intended.</p>
                     <p>Otherwiſe for ſuch Perſons as you are, to begin a Buſineſs of
this Weight, and not to have it ſo prepared before-hand as to be
certain to carry it, but to be put to a doubtful Trial, in caſe it
ſhould not ſucceed as you expect, but that you ſhould be foiled in
it, it would reflect upon your great Honours and Wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="305" facs="tcp:60932:156"/>
Next, As to the Perſon who is to be accuſed as an <hi>Incendiary,</hi>
it will be fit, in my humble Opinion, to conſider his preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and Parts, and Intereſt, wherein Mr. <hi>Maynard</hi> and my
ſelf by our conſtant Attendance in the Houſe of Commons, are
the more capable to give an Account to your Lordſhips; and for
his Intereſt in the Army, ſome Honourable Perſons here preſent,
his Excellency's Officers, are beſt able to inform your Lordſhips.</p>
                     <p>I take Lieutenant General <hi>Cromwel</hi> to be a Gentleman of
Quick and Subtile Parts, and one who hath, eſpecially of late,
gained no ſmall Intereſt in the Houſe of Commons, nor is he
wanting of Friends in the Houſe of Lords, nor of Ability in
himſelf to manage his own Part or Defence to the beſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                     <p>If this be ſo (my Lords) it will be more requiſite to be well
prepared againſt him, before he be brought upon the Stage,
leſt the Iſſue of the Buſineſs be not anſwerable to your Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>I have not yet heard any Particulars mentioned by his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
nor by my Lord Chancellor, or any other; nor do I know any
in my private Obſervations, which will amount to a clear Proof of
ſuch Matters as will ſatisfy the Houſe of Commons, in the Caſe of
Lieut. Gen. <hi>Cromwel</hi> (and according to our Law, and the Courſe
of Proceedings in our Parliament) that he is an <hi>Incendiary,</hi> and to
be puniſhed accordingly.</p>
                     <p>However, I apprehend it to be doubtful, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
adviſe at this time he ſhould be accuſed for an <hi>Incendiary,</hi>
but rather that Direction may be given to collect ſuch particular
Paſſages relating to him, by which your Lordſhips may judg
whether they will amount to prove him an <hi>Incendiary,</hi> or not.</p>
                     <p>And this being done, we may again wait on your Excellence, if
you pleaſe, and upon View of thoſe Proofs we ſhall be better
able to adviſe, and your Lordſhips to judg what will be fit to be
done in this Matter.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Maynard</hi> agreed with Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi> in every Particular, and
only varied that the Word <hi>Incendiary</hi> is not much converſant in our
Law, nor often met with in our Books; but more a Term of Civil
Law and of State, and ſo to be conſidered in this Caſe.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> and Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> and others ſpake ſmartly to
the Buſineſs, and mentioned ſome particular Paſſages and Words
of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> to prove him an <hi>Incendiary;</hi> and that he had not
that Intereſt in the Houſe of Commons as was ſuppoſed, and
would willingly have been upon the Accuſation of him: but the
<hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners were not ſo forward to join with them in it.
So <hi>Cromwel</hi> eſcaped. But ſo did not Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> and Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two Years after, upon <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Accuſation of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="306" facs="tcp:60932:157"/>
If it be ſo ſtrange that <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſo bred, and having no Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
abroad or at home, ſhould in two Years time get ſuch
an Aſcendant over the Parliament's Army in <hi>England,</hi> ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
and diſciplin'd as aforeſaid; it will appear more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
by what mean Perſons he chiefly atchieved it, as by <hi>Pride, Wha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
Hewſon, Harriſon, Goff, Ven, Barkſtead, Cobbet, Okey,</hi> &amp;c. bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Citizens, and not before acquainted with any Military Diſcipline.</p>
                     <p>But while this Canker-Worm was breeding in the Bowels of the
Parliament and Army, the Winds of adverſe Fortune blew almoſt
conſtantly in the Face of the King's Affairs; and to tell particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of all the Battels, Sieges and Rencounters which happened in
<hi>England</hi> in theſe two next Years, would ſwell this Story to a much
greater Bulk than I deſign: You may read them at large in Mr.
<hi>Whitlock</hi>'s <hi>Memoirs,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi>'s Hiſtory of <hi>Charles</hi> the
Firſt: And to ſay nothing of it, would be a Gap in this Treatiſe,
which would interrupt the Deſign of it.</p>
                     <p>Upon the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> the King's Army, commanded by
Gen. <hi>Forth</hi> and Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton,</hi> was totally routed near <hi>Wincheſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
by Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> Sir <hi>William Balfour,</hi> and Sir <hi>Arthur
Haſlerig</hi> (and 'twas obſerved that two <hi>Iriſh</hi> Regiments which ſerved
the King in this Fight, were the firſt which broke and run away:)
And ſoon after Captain <hi>Swanley</hi> ſecured <hi>Milford-Haven, Haver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-Weſt,</hi>
and all <hi>Pembrook-ſhire,</hi> for the Parliament: And upon
the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> my Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and his Son Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> took
<hi>Selby</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> by Storm, and in it Col. <hi>Bellaſis</hi> Governour,
with moſt of the other Officers, and 1600 Common Soldiers, with
all their Guns, Arms and Ammunition.</p>
                     <p>To qualify theſe Loſſes in ſome meaſure, the King about the
latter End of <hi>June,</hi> fights <hi>Waller</hi> at <hi>Cropredy-Bridg,</hi> and routs him,
kills 300 of his Men, and <hi>Weems</hi> General of the Ordnance was
taken Priſoner, with two Lieutenant-Colonels, three Captains, and
ſeveral other Officers, and 180 Common Soldiers, with 14 pieces
of Cannon.</p>
                     <p>This ſmall Victory bore no Proportion to the irreparable Loſs
the King ſuſtained in the <hi>North:</hi> for <hi>York</hi> being beſieged by the
United Forces of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> both the <hi>Fairfaxes,</hi> Father and Son,
and <hi>Leven</hi> (or <hi>Leſley)</hi> General of the <hi>Scots;</hi> Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> with
all the Powers he could raiſe, marched to the Relief of it, after
he had relieved <hi>Latham-Houſe</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> bravely defended by
the Counteſs of <hi>Darby.</hi> The Parliament Forces hereupon raiſed
their Siege, and the Prince fetching a Compaſs about, relieved
<hi>York,</hi> and joined with the Marqueſs of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> ſo as the Prince's
Army was 27000 ſtrong; with which he marched to <hi>Marſton-Moor,</hi>
whither the Parliament's Army was marched before; and upon
the third of <hi>July,</hi> both Armies fought, and the Prince with the
Left Wing charged the Parliament's Right Wing, and routed and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:60932:157"/>
purſued them a great Way; ſo did General <hi>Goring,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi>
and Major General <hi>Porter,</hi> rout the main Body of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
Army; ſo that all the three Parliament Generals, <hi>Fairfax,
Mancheſter</hi> and <hi>Leſley</hi> gave all for loſt.</p>
                     <p>But the Prince, as he did before at <hi>Edghill,</hi> purſuing the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
too far, gave an Opportunity to Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> to rally his
Men, and joining with <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Regiment of Lobſters, armed with
Pot Back and Breſt, fell upon the Right Wing of the King's Army,
and routed them, and alſo the reſt of the King's Foot, deſtitute
of Horſe, and obtain'd a compleat Victory. In this Fight above
7000 were ſlain, 3000 of the King's part taken Priſoners, and 25
Ordnance, 47 Colours, 10000 Arms, two Waggons laden with
Carabines and Piſtols, 130 Barrels of Powder, with all the Bag
and Baggage.</p>
                     <p>After this the Parliament's Generals returned to the Siege
of <hi>York,</hi> and ſummoned it, which was delivered up to them by
Sir <hi>Thomas Glenham,</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> went beyond
Sea. Thus was all the <hi>North</hi> reduced to the Parliament by the fatal
Raſhneſs of the Prince, who might have avoided the Fight, and
joined with the Marqueſs of <hi>Montroſs</hi> and Col. <hi>Clavering,</hi> who
were with 6000 Foot within two Days march of him.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>North</hi> thus ſubdued, upon the Matter, <hi>Eſſex</hi> by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
of my Lord <hi>Roberts,</hi> marches into the <hi>Weſt,</hi> but a different
Fate attended him: For the King followed him, and joining with
Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> followed <hi>Eſſex</hi> into <hi>Cornwal,</hi> where he block'd up
all the Avenues, ſo as <hi>Eſſex</hi> muſt either fight or be ſtarv'd; but
in regard that the King had poſſeſt himſelf of all the Paſſages,
<hi>Eſſex</hi> could not fight without an apparent Hazard of the Loſs of
his <hi>Army;</hi> However, Sir <hi>William Balfour</hi> with 2300 Horſe, brake
through the King's <hi>Army,</hi> and got to <hi>Salt-Aſh,</hi> and from thence to
<hi>Plimouth,</hi> which held for the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Now were the Parliament's Foot in a wretched State, the King
cloſely purſuing them, and the Countrey People riſing upon
them: Hereupon <hi>Eſſex</hi> deſerts them, and with divers of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
by Sea got to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> leaving <hi>Skippon</hi> to take care of the
reſt; who upon the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>September</hi> capitulated, <hi>to deliver up to
the King all their Artillery, with all the Bag and Baggage; no Perſon
under a Corporal to wear any kind of Weapon; all Officers above, to
wear only Sword and Piſtol.</hi> And ſo <hi>Skippon</hi> marched to <hi>Pool,</hi>
which was in the Parliament's Power.</p>
                     <p>The Ill Succeſs of <hi>Eſſex</hi> in this Expedition, was the Cauſe of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> his Fall, (tho the Parliament at preſent ſeemed to be
otherwiſe diſpoſed) and of the Riſe of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> as we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe things were doing in the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> other
<hi>Actions</hi> of <hi>leſs Conſequence</hi> happened. Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:60932:158"/>
taken <hi>Mountgomery-Caſtle,</hi> the King's Forces advanced in a
much greater Body to retake it; whereupon Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
But being joined with Sir <hi>William Brereton,</hi> Sir <hi>John Meldrum</hi>
(a <hi>Scot)</hi> and Sir <hi>William Fairfax,</hi> returned and charged the King's
Party, and took Priſoner M. G. <hi>Broughton,</hi> Lt. Col. <hi>Bludwel,</hi> M. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams,</hi>
nine Captains, many inferiour Officers, and 1500 common
Soldiers: Of the Parliament's Party Sir <hi>William Fairfax</hi> was ſlain
with Eleven Wounds, Maj. <hi>Fitz-Symons,</hi> and about 40 Souldiers,
and 60 wounded. <hi>Monmouth</hi> Town and Caſtle were ſurprized by
<hi>Maſſey,</hi> with the Loſs only of Six Men. Lieut. Gen. <hi>Leſley</hi> in the
<hi>North,</hi> fell upon the Forces commanded by Sir <hi>Philip Muſgrave,</hi>
kill'd divers upon the Place, and took 100 Priſoners. My Lord
<hi>Herbert,</hi> Son of the Earl of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> was beaten by <hi>Maſſey,</hi> who
killed 50, and took 60 Priſoners; and <hi>Maſſey</hi> fell upon a Party of
the King's near <hi>Beachy,</hi> killed 70, and took 170 Priſoners: and
Col. <hi>Charles Fleetwood</hi> took two Troops of the King's Horſe near
<hi>Belvoir</hi> Caſtle.</p>
                     <p>From theſe leſſer Actions we now advance to tell of Greater:
The Parliament's Army every where victorious in the <hi>North, Leſley</hi>
had now an Opportunity to return to <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> which he ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
to yield, which being refuſed, he ſtormed and took it by
Force; whereupon Sir <hi>John Marlay</hi> the Mayor, and others, fled
to the Caſtle, and would have capitulated, but were denied, and
ſo were forced to ſurrender at Diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>But how ſucceſsful ſoever the Parliament's Forces were in the
North after the Fight at <hi>Marſlon-Moor,</hi> the King reaped but
little after the Parliament's Foot had delivered up their Arms in the
Weſt; for <hi>Eſſex</hi> having joined <hi>Mancheſter</hi> and <hi>Waller,</hi> reſolved to
hinder the King's Return to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and upon the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
rendezvouz'd the Army at <hi>Aldermaſton-Park,</hi> and next Night
privately paſſed the Water at a Ford near <hi>Padworth,</hi> and next
Morning to <hi>Bucklebury-Heath</hi> near <hi>Newberry,</hi> where the King
then was; and about 12 a Clock drew down their whole Army
between <hi>Thatcham</hi> and <hi>Shaw,</hi> and skirmiſhed with the King's
Horſe; <hi>Mancheſter</hi>'s Troops and the <hi>London</hi> Train'd-Bands
croſſed the River <hi>Kennet</hi> between <hi>Newberry</hi> and the Hill, and
forced the King's Party which kept the Paſs from thence, with
ſome Execution; but Sir <hi>Bernard Astley</hi> (Son of Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> or
the Lord <hi>Astley)</hi> coming to their Reſcue, forced the Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
back again.</p>
                     <p>In the Afternoon 4000 of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Waller</hi>'s Horſe and Dragoons,
with 500 Foot, charged the King's Forces on the Weſt of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry,</hi>
and forced them to retreat in ſome Diſorder, and ſome of
the King's Field-Pieces were taken; <hi>Eſſex</hi> followed the Succeſs,
and charged the King's Life-Guard, whom he overpowered, and
had much more endamaged, if the Lord <hi>Bernard Stuart</hi> had not
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:60932:158"/>
come to their Aſſiſtance, and ſecured their Retreat: but the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentarians
every way advancing, beat the King's Army out of
the Field, with the Loſs of many Colours, and two Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.
Sir <hi>Anthony St. Leger,</hi> Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Leak,</hi> Lieutenant-Colonel
<hi>Topping,</hi> and Captain <hi>Catclyne</hi> (elder Brother of Sir <hi>Nevil
Catclyne,</hi> my worthy Friend) were killed; and the Earl of <hi>Cleve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and ſome few others, taken Priſoners.</p>
                     <p>If the King's Affairs ſucceeded ſo ill in the <hi>West,</hi> they did worſe
in the <hi>North;</hi> for <hi>Leverpool</hi> ſubmitted to the Parliament, and <hi>Leſley</hi>
had <hi>Tinmouth-Caſtle</hi> (a Place which hereafter he ſhall be better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with, tho not in the Quality of a General of an Army,
but a Priſoner) ſurrender'd upon Articles.</p>
                     <p>After this, <hi>Janus</hi>'s Temple was ſhut this Year, if you begin it
at <hi>January.</hi> And now a <hi>Treaty of Peace</hi> at <hi>Vxbridg</hi> is ſet on foot
at the Deſire of the King; but no Succeſs attended it.</p>
                     <p>This Year, tho the Princes <hi>Rupert</hi> and <hi>Maurice</hi> followed the
King in his Wars againſt the Parliament, yet the Elector <hi>Palatine,
Frederick,</hi> their elder Brother, petitioned the Parliament that he
might come over, and take the Covenant; which tho at firſt they
refuſed, yet afterwards they admitted him, and allowed him
8000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> out of my Lord <hi>Petres</hi> and other Delinquents
Eſtates: and ſo he continued till after the Treaty at <hi>Munſter</hi> 1648,
where he led a Life not becoming a Prince in Adverſity.</p>
                     <p>The Treaty of Peace at <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridg</hi> not ſucceeding, the Parliament
took the Town of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> which, as it is one of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
of all the Towns of <hi>England,</hi> ſo it ſtopt, on that part, the
Entercourſe of <hi>Wales</hi> with the Counties of <hi>Salop, Cheſter,</hi> and
<hi>Worceſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to throw a little Water into the Wine of the Parliament's
Succeſſes, Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> about the Beginning of
<hi>March,</hi> routed a great Body of the Parliamentarians in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi>
and defeated the Army commanded by my Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> which
beſieg'd <hi>Pomfret-Caſtle;</hi> and from thence marched into <hi>Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
and defeated a great Body of the Parliament's Forces com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

                     <p>We begin this Year with the <hi>Self-denying Ordinance,</hi> (tho

Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> ſays it was this Year, Mr. <hi>Whitlock 1644.)</hi> But
the Lords refuſed to concur with the Commons herein; ſo as this
Ordinance began with a Rupture between the two Houſes, ſo

                        <pb n="310" facs="tcp:60932:159"/>
Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi> made a fine and learned Speech againſt this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
which you may read at large <hi>fol.</hi> 114, 115. of his <hi>Memoirs.</hi>
The pretended Reaſon for this Ordinance was, the Thinneſs of
the Houſe, which by Employment in the War, would render
them much thinner: To which Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi> anſwered, <hi>It might
be ſupplied by filling up the Commons by new Elections.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He objected againſt the Ordinance, the Examples of the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Romans,</hi> who had the greateſt Offices both of War and
Peace conferred upon their Senators; becauſe they having greater
Intereſts than others, were more capable to do them the greateſt
Services: and that by paſſing this Ordinance, they would lay aſide
the General <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Warwick, Denbigh,</hi> and <hi>Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
the Lords <hi>Willoughby</hi> and <hi>Roberts;</hi> and of their own Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
the Lords <hi>Grey</hi> (of <hi>Growby)</hi> and <hi>Fairfax,</hi> Sir <hi>William Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
Cromwel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> Sir <hi>William Brere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
and Sir <hi>John Meyrick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tho the Commons paſſed the <hi>Self-denying Ordinance,</hi> yet they
diſpenſed with it in reference to <hi>Cromwel, Skippon,</hi> and <hi>Ireton,</hi>
and Sir <hi>William Waller.</hi> Hereupon the Earls of <hi>Eſſex, Denbigh,</hi>
and <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> lay down their Commiſſions. Here it's obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
That the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> as he was the firſt which headed an
Army againſt the King, and whoſe Authority was ſo great, that
'twas believed if he had not done it, the Parliament could not
have rais'd an Army, is now the firſt diſcarded by the Commons,
without giving any Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>In this new Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, Sir <hi>Thomas Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi>
was made General, <hi>Cromwel</hi> Lieutenant-General, and <hi>Skippon</hi>
Major-General. The Royaliſts conceived Mountains of Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to follow (and that not improbably) from the Diviſions in
the Parliament's Army, which ſucceeded quite contrary.</p>
                     <p>For upon the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>April, Fairfax</hi> having gathered his Army
together at <hi>Windſor,</hi> ſent <hi>Cromwel</hi> with a Brigade of Horſe and
Dragoons, to intercept a Convoy of Horſe which Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>
had ſent from <hi>Worceſter</hi> to fetch off the King from <hi>Oxford,</hi> with a
Train of Artillery to take the Field; which <hi>Cromwel</hi> met at <hi>Iſlip,</hi>
and routed them, took divers Priſoners, and 200 Horſe: and
from thence <hi>Cromwel</hi> march'd and took <hi>Bletchingdon-Houſe,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by Colonel <hi>Windebank</hi> (Sir <hi>Francis</hi>'s own Son) by Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
upon the firſt Summons; for which <hi>Windebank</hi> was ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by a Court-Martial, and ſhot to Death. But <hi>Cromwel</hi> had not
ſo good Succeſs at <hi>Faringdon,</hi> which he aſſaulted, and was beaten
off, with the loſs of 200 of his Men.</p>
                     <p>The King underſtanding that <hi>Fairfax</hi> had a Deſign to beſiege
<hi>Oxford,</hi> ſent to Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and General <hi>Goring</hi> to fetch him off,
which they did about the beginning of <hi>May;</hi> and the King march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
towards the Relief of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> then beſieged by the Parliament's
Forces: and <hi>Fairfax</hi> lays cloſe Siege to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="311" facs="tcp:60932:159"/>
The King relieved <hi>Cheſter;</hi> and in his Return, takes <hi>Leiceſter</hi>
by Storm: This put <hi>Fairfax</hi> to his Trumps, ſo that if he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Siege of <hi>Oxford,</hi> he would leave all the mid-land parts of
<hi>England</hi> to the Mercy of the King. So he raiſes his Siege, and
marches to fight the King's Army.</p>
                     <p>My Lord <hi>Aſtley</hi> was Lieutenant-General of the King's Foot,
whoſe Nephew was Sir <hi>Iſaac Aſtley,</hi> my Lord's eldeſt Brother's el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
Son, who married a Couſin-German of mine; and after the
War was over, my Lord <hi>Aſtley</hi> being at his Nephew's, in Diſcourſe
of the Wars, my Lord told him, That upon the Approach of the
Parliament's Army, the King called a Council of War, where by
the Advice of my Lord <hi>Aſtley</hi> it was reſolved to march North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and deſtroy the Country Proviſions, and leave the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
Army at their Election, whether they would follow the
King, or beſiege <hi>Leiceſter:</hi> But next Morning, quite contrary to
the Order of Council, Orders were given to prepare to fight the
Parliament's Army, when there was little time to draw up the
Army; ſo inconſtant and irreſolute was the King in this, as of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all his other Actions; and ſo forward was the King herein,
that he marched to meet <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s Army near <hi>Naſeby</hi> in <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonſhire.</hi>
This was upon <hi>Saturday, June</hi> the <hi>14th.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if the Reſolution to fight was inconſiderate and raſh, ſo
was the Fight; for Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> who commanded the right
Wing of the King's Horſe, charged the left Wing of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's,
commanded by <hi>Ireton,</hi> and routed them, and wounded
<hi>Ireton</hi> in the Thigh; and as before, at <hi>Edg-hill</hi> and <hi>Marſton-Moor,</hi>
he purſued the Enemy ſo far, that he left the reſt of the Army
expoſed to the Aſſaults of the Enemy; ſo here he followed the
Chaſe almoſt to <hi>Naſeby,</hi> leaving the left Wing of the King's Army
commanded by Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> open, to be charged by
<hi>Cromwel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That which compleated the Parliament's Victory, and the King's
utter Overthrow in this Fight, was, the not obſerving the Orders
the Day before, of the King's Retreat; for <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> being oppreſt
by the Parliament's Forces, Sir <hi>Marmaduke</hi> had Expectation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
the King's Party there, which being croſs'd by the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Day's Fight, his Brigade, as well as himſelf, grew
diſcontented; ſo as he no ways anſwered the Gallant Actions
which before he had atchieved: And <hi>Cromwel</hi> having forced
Sir <hi>Marmaduke</hi> to retreat, joining with <hi>Fairfax,</hi> charged the King's
Foot (who had beaten the Parliament's, and got Poſſeſſion of their
Ordnance, and thought themſelves certain of the Victory) but
being in Confuſion and out of Order, and having no Horſe to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them, were eaſily over-born by <hi>Fairfax</hi> and <hi>Cromwel;</hi> and ſo
<hi>Fairfax</hi>'s Army obtain'd a moſt abſolute Victory over the King's.</p>

We hear no more of Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> in this Fight, who, 'twas

                     </p>
                     <p>In this Fight, the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> the Lord <hi>Aſtley,</hi> and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Ruſſel,</hi> were wounded, and 20 Colonels, Knights, and Officers
of Note, and 600 common Soldiers, were ſlain on the King's ſide;

80 Lieutenants, 200 Enſigns and other Officers, and 4500 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

Arms, 40 Barrels of Powder, 200 Carriages, with all their Bag

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If the King were unfortunate in the Succeſs of this Fight, he
was not leſs in the Diſcovery of his ſecret Counſels with the Queen,
which were ſo contrary to thoſe he declared to the Kingdom; for
in his Letter to the Queen,</hi> he declared his Intention to make Peace
with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and to have 40000 of them over into <hi>England</hi> to
proſecute the War here. <hi>And in others he complained,</hi> he could not
prevail with his Mungrel Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> to Vote that the
Parliament of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> were not a Lawful Parliament: <hi>So little
Thanks had theſe Noble Lords and Gentlemen for their expoſing
their Lives and Fortunes in Defence of the King in his Adverſity.
What then might they expect, if he ſhould prevail by Conqueſt?</hi>
That he would not make a Peace with the Rebels <hi>(the Parliament)</hi>
without her Approbation, nor go one jot from the Paper ſhe ſent him:
That in the Treaty at <hi>Uxbridg,</hi> he did not poſitively own the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it being otherwiſe to be conſtrued, tho they were ſo ſimple as not
to find it out: and that it was recorded in the Notes of the King's
Council, that he did not acknowledg them a Parliament. <hi>See</hi> Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock'<hi>s

                     </p>
                     <p>The Members having got theſe Papers, not only printed and
publiſhed them, but order'd them to be kept upon Record; and
alſo made a publick Declaration of them, wherein they ſhew what
the Nobility and Gentry which follow'd the King might truſt to.</p>
                     <p>The King's Army being overthrown, the Parliament had two
Armies, and the King none, but that which was commanded by
General <hi>Goring,</hi> which at that time beſieg'd <hi>Taunton,</hi> and ſore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſt
it; but it being governed by <hi>Blake</hi> (after the famous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral

wonderful Reſiſtance. And now you'll ſee the King's Gariſons
ſurrender by heaps.</p>
                     <p>For, two Days after the Fight at <hi>Naſeby,</hi> viz. <hi>June 14. Fairfax</hi>
ſat down before <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> where my Lord <hi>Loughborough</hi> was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

After the Surrender of <hi>York,</hi> the Year before, the King made
that noble Gentleman, Sir <hi>Thomas Glenham,</hi> Governour of <hi>Carliſle,</hi>
which he defended till the Gariſon were forced to eat Horſe-fleſh:
And the Town being beſieged by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi>

                     <p>From <hi>Leiceſter, Fairfax</hi> marches to the Relief of <hi>Taunton;</hi>
whereupon <hi>Goring</hi> drew off, and retreated to <hi>Langport,</hi> where
<hi>Fairfax</hi> routed <hi>Goring,</hi> kill'd 200 of his Men, took 1400 Priſoners,

the King, who diſplaced <hi>Willis,</hi> and made the Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.
This cauſed great Diſſenſion, not only in the Gariſon,

                     <p>In this forlorn ſtate the King left <hi>Newark,</hi> and with 300 Horſe

                     <p>Letters were taken in my Lord <hi>Digby</hi>'s Coach, after his Rout at

                        <hi>Glamorgan</hi> had brought his Buſineſs to ſome Iſſue, when State-Reaſons
enforced <hi>Ormond,</hi> and <hi>Digby,</hi> and the Council, to impriſon
him; but this gave Diſtaſte to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who thereupon ſuſpected
double Dealings, and ſo neither ſent over the promiſed 10000
Men, nor any Aid to <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> tho <hi>Glamorgan</hi> was quickly releaſed
upon the Bail of ſix or eight <hi>Iriſh</hi> Peers. The Parliament here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
was ſo incenſed, that they refuſed either to treat with the
King, or to admit him to come to <hi>London,</hi> (ſee <hi>Baker,</hi> f. 473.)
or this Buſineſs to end here; but rendred all the King's ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Treaties with the Parliament ſuſpected, and the end of
attaining the King's Propoſitions more difficult. And here you
may ſee how this King would proſtitute his Honour and Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
contrary to what he ſo often profeſſed, not only to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but alſo to the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> his own Party.</p>
                     <p>Now things every where go to wreck on the King's ſide; <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
was ſurrendred to <hi>Fairfax,</hi> by Sir <hi>Hugh Pollard</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor;

<hi>Hopton</hi> accepted of Terms from <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and disbanded his

<hi>Mount: Latham-Houſe</hi> which the Counteſs of <hi>Derby</hi> bravely

                     <p>In this deſperate State of the King's Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> the
King's Expectations in <hi>Scotland</hi> were much fallen too: For after

<hi>Scots</hi> had little to do in the North; ſo as General <hi>Leſley</hi> had lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to march to <hi>Newark</hi> with his Foot to join M. G. <hi>Pointz,</hi> who
had block'd it up; and <hi>David Leſley</hi> with the Horſe to march into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> where <hi>Montroſs</hi> his Men after he had beaten Gen. <hi>Bailey</hi>
at <hi>Philipſhaugh,</hi> being full of Plunder, and being a Voluntier Army,
and not under regular Diſcipline, disbanded in great Numbers and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:60932:162"/>
returned home, when <hi>David Leſley</hi> ſet upon the Remainder and
routed them, and gave Quarter to the reſt, whom yet he murdered
in cold Blood. Here you may ſee the different Tempers of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> Nation, for you find no ſuch Acts done in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in the Heats of all the War.</p>
                     <p>In all the War in <hi>Scotland</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Huntley</hi> obſtinately
refuſed to join with <hi>Montroſs;</hi> and after the Defeat of <hi>Montroſs</hi>'s
Foot, <hi>Montroſs</hi> went in Perſon to entreat <hi>Huntley</hi> to join in their
common Intereſt againſt the <hi>Kirk,</hi> which <hi>Huntley</hi> not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
but would not deign to ſee <hi>Montroſs,</hi> [yet this did <hi>Huntley</hi>
no good, for after <hi>Montroſs</hi> his Army was disbanded, the <hi>Kirk</hi>-Party
cut off his Head] ſo as <hi>Montroſs</hi> was forced to retreat into
the <hi>Highlands,</hi> and act defenſively.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Exeter</hi> upon the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> ſurrenders to <hi>Fairfax,</hi> which
was followed by <hi>Barnſtable</hi> Town and Fort, St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s Mount,
<hi>Dunſtan</hi> Caſtle, <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> and other Places of leſs Note.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Glenham</hi> having honourably defended <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle,</hi>
the King thought no other ſo fit to be Governour of <hi>Oxford</hi>
as he, which being block'd up by the Parliament Forces, the King
thought himſelf in no Security in it; for the Parliament refuſed
to admit him to come to <hi>London,</hi> unleſs he ſigned their Propoſitions.
Now the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador in the <hi>Scots</hi> Quarters adviſed the
King to throw himſelf into the <hi>Scots</hi> Power; herein you may
obſerve, that tho <hi>Richlieu</hi> were dead, yet <hi>Mazarine</hi> continued the
Correſpondence between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> which yet were
Penſioners to <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This being <hi>Hobſon</hi>'s Choice, the King only accompanied by one
<hi>Hudſon</hi> a Miniſter, and Mr. <hi>John Aſhburnham,</hi> throws himſelf into
the Power of the <hi>Scots</hi> then beſieging <hi>Newark,</hi> this was the fifth
of <hi>May.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus this poor Prince to avoid his preſent Condition, ſeeks
Protection from thoſe which brought him into it; which tho he
got nothing by it, yet the <hi>Scots</hi> inſtead of protecting him, ſhall
only make a Bargain and Sale of him: for having him in their
Power, they reſolve to make a double Market of him, <hi>viz.</hi> To
have him to order <hi>Montroſs</hi> to disband his Army, and then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and then to ſell him to the Parliament for
ſo much as they could get: that of <hi>Montroſs,</hi> it was no ſooner
asked than granted; but ſoon after he was gone, the Covenanters
ſeize <hi>Huntley</hi> and cut off his Head; the Parliament too deſire the
King to give Order for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gariſons to ſurrender, which he
granted; ſo here we end the Wars in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King and Parliament at preſent. And now you'll ſee how
the ending of theſe Wars was the beginning of the Ruin of the
Parliament and <hi>Scots</hi> Covenanters; for the <hi>Scots</hi> having got their
Ends by <hi>Montroſs</hi> his disbanding his Army, yet the Bargain for the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:60932:162"/>
Sale of the King being a mighty Matter to the <hi>Scots,</hi> required a
longer time, and the <hi>Scots</hi> would not loſe one <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Pound they
could get for him; and therefore, tho the King put himſelf into
the Power of the <hi>Scots</hi> the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1646, yet the Bargain was
not concluded till <hi>January</hi> following, and then the <hi>Scots</hi> fluſh of
Money return home, finding all things in Peace now <hi>Montroſs</hi> is
gone; and the Parliament having bought the King, confine him to
<hi>Holdenby-Houſe,</hi> a Houſe of the King's in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> under the
Guard of a ſelect Company of Covenanters, whereof Sir <hi>John
Cooke,</hi> Secretary <hi>Cooke</hi>'s Son, was one.</p>
                     <p>Thus this Prince, who before had ſhifted the worthy Members
of Parliament from one Priſon to another, that they might have
no Benefit of their <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>'s, and the Conſtables of <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire</hi>
from one Meſſenger to another, is himſelf ſhifted from
one Place a Priſoner to another, without any hope of an <hi>Habeas
Corpus:</hi> He that before, by his abſolute Will and Pleaſure, would
without any Law ſeize his Subjects Goods, and commit them to
Priſon, cannot now enjoy his own Eſtate in his own Houſe: He
that before arbitrarily raiſed Ship-Money, has not now one Ship to
command.</p>
                     <p>One would think the Covenanters had their Game ſure enough,
now thoſe in <hi>Scotland</hi> had got rid of <hi>Montroſs,</hi> and full of Money,
and thoſe in <hi>England</hi> had got the King in their Power, and the
King's Army utterly ſubdued, and both Kingdoms united into one
<hi>ſolemn League and Covenant;</hi> ſo that both may ſing their <hi>Requiem</hi>
for many Years.</p>
                     <p>But ſee the Inſtability of Human Affairs, where they are not
founded in Truth and Righteouſneſs; for the <hi>Scots</hi> Directory, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm
and Government, ſorted as ill with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Genius,
as <hi>Laud</hi>'s Liturgy, Canons and High Commiſſion did with the <hi>Scots;</hi>
and the rigid Execution of them as inſolent and tyrannical, as the
Proceedings in the Star-Chamber and High-Commiſſion; and theſe
being general, equally offended all: and tho the <hi>Cavalier</hi> Party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the Hatches ſaid little, yet the Brawls and Invectives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and other Parties, were as fierce as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Orthodox</hi> in <hi>Laud</hi>'s time, ſo that things
were not like to continue long at this rate.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament having the King now in their Power, the <hi>Scots</hi>
gone, yet <hi>Ireland</hi> (I mean the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt in it) in a very
deplorable State, and being apprehenſive of the Temper of the
Army, whoſe Principles were <hi>Anti-Presbyterian;</hi> and that they
might in ſome meaſure eaſe the Countrey of maintaining the whole
Army, reſolved that 12000 of the Army ſhould be ſent over into
<hi>Ireland</hi> to be commanded by Major General <hi>Skippon,</hi> and 6000
Horſe, 2000 Dragoons, and 6000 Foot to be kept up in <hi>England,</hi>
and commanded by Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax.</hi>

                        <hi>Cromwel</hi> was aware of what the Members deſigned, and the
Members were as jealous of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and therefore would not
diſpenſe with the <hi>Self-denying Ordinance,</hi> that he ſhould be in the
Army; however, <hi>Cromwel</hi> had his Agents in it, and by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
and other zealous <hi>Independants,</hi> foment their Jealouſies,
that the Parliament deſigned to disband them without Payment of
their Arrears; and in this Ferment they choſe two out of every
Regiment, which they called <hi>Adjutators,</hi> to whom they gave Power
to hold Councils, and judg what was fit to be done for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good.</p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>Adjutators</hi> were called <hi>Levellers,</hi> who cried up <hi>Liberty,
and the Power of the People,</hi> and aſſumed to themſelves a Power
in their Councils above what the Colonels claimed.</p>
                     <p>The Proceedings of the <hi>Adjutators</hi> ſtartled the Parliament, and
in a great meaſure the Colonels and Officers of the Army; ſo that
unleſs <hi>Cromwel</hi> did appear in the Army, and by his Authority did
reſtrain the Licence which the <hi>Adjutators</hi> aſſumed, they ſat very
looſe in their Places.</p>
                     <p>Cromwel <hi>knew this as well as they, and that the</hi> Adjutators <hi>ſtruck
at his Authority as well as the Officers; ſo that when there was a
Debate in the Houſe of Commons how to ſuppreſs the</hi> Adjutators,
Cromwel <hi>profeſſed, and called God to witneſs,</hi> That he was certain
the Souldiers would at the firſt word of his Command, if he were
among them, throw down their Arms at the Parliament's Feet; and
ſolemnly ſwore, that he rather wiſhed himſelf and his whole Family
burnt, than that the Army ſhould break out into Sedition: <hi>And the
Houſe had ſo little Wit as to believe him, and ſo ſent him down
to appeaſe the Army.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hereupon <hi>Cromwel</hi> order'd a general Muſter of the Army upon
<hi>Hownſlow-Heath,</hi> where the Army was divided, and the <hi>Levelling
Party</hi> refuſed to come under <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Command; whereupon
<hi>Cromwel</hi> ſent to the <hi>Levellers</hi> to ſend ſome to treat of their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
which they did; and when they came, <hi>Cromwel</hi> with an
undaunted Boldneſs piſtoll'd three of the moſt forward of them, and
ſeized the reſt, and then the <hi>Levelling</hi> Part of the Army ſubmitted.</p>
                     <p>The Sectaries, of which the Army was compoſed, tho they had
the Sword in their Hands, yet had no face of Authority to recur
to, the Presbyterian Members in both Houſes being three to one;
they therefore ſend Cornet <hi>Joyce</hi> with a Party of Horſe to <hi>Holdenby,</hi>
who the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1647, (which was in leſs than four Months
after the Members had brought the King thither) take the King
out of the Parliament-Commiſſioners Power, and keep him in the
Army.</p>
                     <p>And now this poor Prince (for ſo he may be truly called, ſince
he, who before by his abſolute Will and Pleaſure would take his
Subjects Eſtates, has now no Power to get his own) is fallen into
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:60932:163"/>
the Hands of another ſort of Flatterers than in the former, yet
theſe intended him no more good than the former, <hi>viz.</hi> only to
gratify their Ambition, Avarice and Treachery, by making uſe of
the King's Name.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſeem to lament the hard Conditions the Members impoſe
upon him, not only in his Liberty, but in keeping him from his
Children and Friends, and allow him both, profeſſing they would
never lay down Arms until they had put the Scepter into his Hands,
and procured better Conditions for his Friends.</p>
                     <p>In order hereunto, they ſeem to join the King's Intereſt with
theirs; and in their Declaration for Redreſs of Grievances, declare
for the King and People, and that the Members prefix a certain
time for their ſitting, ſo that a new Parliament may be called, and
thereby the Nation ſettled upon ſure Foundations.</p>
                     <p>Here you may obſerve a new Face of the Parliament's Affairs
quite inverted; for the Army were as much in love with their
being ſo, as the Parliament was of their ſitting: And now the
Army, which was rais'd only to do the Parliament's Journey-work,
would only allow the Members a certain time for their ſitting.

the Army charge them with High-Treaſon; the Charge againſt

                     <p>Here you may ſee into what a Labyrinth of Diſtraction and

impriſoned for performing the Truſt repoſed in them by their
Country, they had the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience for their
Support, and the known Laws for their Protection; and here they
knew what to truſt to, and ſo they inſiſted upon the Laws, and by
them in due time were delivered from their Impriſonment; but
now the Laws and Conſtitutions of the Nation were broken down,
and they charged at random by the Army, they had no Defence
to recur to, but for Safeguard fled beyond Sea. What became of
Colonel <hi>Long</hi> I cannot tell, but Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> never return'd till after
King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Reſtoration; and Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton</hi>
being ſuſpected to have the <hi>Plague,</hi> was ſhut out of <hi>Calais,</hi> and

                        <hi>Glyn</hi> had ſo little Wit, as to believe the <hi>Law</hi> would be his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
and ſo did abide a Trial: but he was miſtaken in his
Meaſures; for tho he defended himſelf with much Prudence, yet
he was diſcharged from being a Member of the Houſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Tower during their Pleaſure. But the Houſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
higher againſt Sir <hi>John Maynard,</hi> and order'd an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of High Treaſon to be drawn up againſt him; and ordered
<hi>Nichols</hi> to be taken into Cuſtody, but he eſcaped from the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Covenanters could not be ſo purblind, as not to ſee
whereto this tended; and were madded that they which had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
the War, and by the Aid of their Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were
in a fair Poſſibility of bringing it to their Deſires againſt the King,
ſhould not only be outed of their conceived Glory and Reward by
theſe Upſtarts of the Army, but alſo the principal of them to be
perſecuted and deſtroyed for continuing firm to their Gude-Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The Militia of <hi>London</hi> was ſetled upon the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> in the
Management of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who were very induſtrious in
compleating their Companies, both of the Trained-Bands and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia;
but this was counter to the Deſign of the Army, and judged
to be a Conſpiracy againſt it: whereupon <hi>Fairfax</hi> (who bore the
Name, tho <hi>Cromwel</hi> rul'd all) upon the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> ſent a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Parliament, <hi>That the Militia of the City of</hi> London <hi>might
be put into the Hands of Perſons that were better affected to the Army:</hi>
Which the Commons tamely ſubmitted to; and upon the <hi>23d</hi> of
<hi>July</hi> repealed the Ordinance of the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>May.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hereupon the City met in Common-Council, and reſolved to
petition the Commons againſt it, which they did; and upon the</hi>
26th, <hi>by the Sheriffs, and ſome of the Common-Council, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
their Petition to the Commons: And about an Hour after,
about 1000 Apprentices delivered another Petition, complaining,</hi>
That to order the City's Militia was the City's Birth-right, belonging
to them by Charters confirmed in Parliament; for Defence whereof,
they had adventured their Lives as far as the Army: And deſired
that the Militia might be put again into the ſame Hands in which it
was put with the Parliament's and City's Conſent, by the Ordinance of
the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>May.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the reading of this Petition, the Lords revoked the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> and renewed that of the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi>
and ſent it down to the Commons for their Conſent, and kept
back ſome of the Commons, till the Members within agreed with
the Lords, and then they returned: And after ſome time, they,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:60932:164"/>
or ſome others, upon the riſing of the Houſe, took the Speaker
and thruſt him back into the Chair, and there kept him and the
Members, till they enforced them to paſs a Vote, <hi>That the King
ſhould come to</hi> London: And then both Houſes adjourned for
four Days.</p>
                     <p>In this Interval, the Members which favoured the Army, and
the Speakers of both Houſes, went to the Army, and there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of the Violences upon the Parliament, tho none were done
to the Lords: And after the four Days Adjournment, the Houſes
met, and the Lords choſe my Lord <hi>Hunſdon</hi> their Speaker, and the
Commons Mr. <hi>Henry Pelham,</hi> and paſſed theſe Votes:</p>

under the Command of Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> Major-General <hi>Maſſey,</hi>

Army: Beſides, the Borough of <hi>Southwark</hi> were generally

                     <p>The Aldermen and Common-Council of the City now deſert

Here obſerve, That the Members which did not run to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
but met in Time and Place according to that Adjournment,
were as much a Parliament, as thoſe which continued at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
after the King left them; and the Members which met at
<hi>Oxford</hi> were as much a Parliament as thoſe which met after they
were reſtored by the Army.</p>
                     <p>When the Members were returned, the Commons voted an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
of High Treaſon againſt the Earls of <hi>Suffolk, Lincoln,</hi>
and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and the Lords <hi>Berkley, Hunſdon, Willoughby</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and <hi>Maynard;</hi> ſuch a Stalking-Horſe was Treaſon now made,
and the Crime no more than what themſelves had done after the
King left them. And Sir <hi>John Gage,</hi> the Lord-Mayor, Alderman
<hi>Bunce, Langham, Cullam,</hi> and <hi>Adams,</hi> were committed to the
Tower for High-Treaſon, for <hi>Forcing the Parliament.</hi> But if this
were Treaſon in them, before the next Year goes round you'll ſee
<hi>Cromwel</hi> out-treaſon this a Bar and half. And as Sir <hi>Phil. Gurney,</hi>
Sir <hi>Henry Garoway,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Whitmore,</hi> were committed to
the Tower for adhering to the King againſt the Parliament; ſo
now the Mayor and Aldermen were committed to the Tower for
adhering to the Parliament againſt the Army.</p>
                     <p>During theſe Diſcords and Confuſions, the <hi>Scots</hi> were in great
Grumble, that the Work of Reformation, which united both
Kingdoms in Adherence to their Solemn League and Covenant,
was in danger to be overthrown by the over-ſpreading of Hereſy
and Schiſm; which was ſo much more lamented, by how much
after their Bargain and Sale of the King, both Houſes voted, <hi>That
if the King refuſed to paſs Propoſitions for Peace, they will do nothing
which may break the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Affection of both Kingdoms, but to
preſerve the ſame.</hi> This was the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> 1646.</p>
                     <p>Now both Factions, Parliament and Army, ſeem to court the
King; and the Parliament ſent Propoſitions of Peace to the King
at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> the ſame they ſent to the King at <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi>
when he was in the Power of the <hi>Scots:</hi> which you may read in
<hi>Whitlock</hi>'s <hi>Memoirs,</hi> fol. 120. <hi>b.</hi> and <hi>121. a.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But now the</hi> Myſtery of Iniquity <hi>works; for</hi> Cromwel <hi>was as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
the King ſhould agree with the Parliament, as the King was
unwilling to agree to them: and therefore</hi> Cromwel <hi>gave Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to the Commiſſioners,</hi> That if the King would aſſent to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
lower than thoſe of the Parliament, that the Army would
ſettle him again in his Throne. <hi>Hereupon the King returned Anſwer
to the Parliament,</hi> That he waved now the Propoſitions ſent to him,
or any Treaty upon them, and flies to the Propoſals of the Army, urges
a Treaty upon them, and ſuch as he ſhall make; profeſſes he will give
Satisfaction to ſettle the Proteſtant Religion, with Liberty to tender
Conſciences; to ſecure the Laws, Liberty and Property, and Privileges
of Parliament: and of thoſe concerning <hi>Scotland,</hi> he will treat apart
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:60932:165"/>
with the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners. <hi>See</hi> Whitlock'<hi>s</hi> Memoirs, <hi>fol.</hi> 271. b.</p>
                     <p>Upon the reading of the King's Anſwer, a Day was appointed
by either Houſe to conſider of it; and that in the mean time
it be communicated to the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners.</p>
                     <p>There was a Report at that time, and ſo yet continues, (tho I
cannot find the bottom of it, yet I am confident in time it will
appear) that <hi>Cromwel</hi> made a private Article with the King, <hi>That
if the King cloſed with the Propoſitions of the Army,</hi> Cromwel <hi>ſhould
be advanced to a Degree higher than any other, as</hi> Vicar-General <hi>of</hi>
England, <hi>as</hi> Cromwel <hi>was in the Reign of</hi> Henry 8.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the King was ſo Uxorious, that he would do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
communicating it to the Queen; and wrote to her,</hi> That tho
he aſſented to the Army's Propoſals, yet if by aſſenting to them he
could procure Peace, it would be eaſier then to take off <hi>Cromwel</hi>
than now he was the Head that govern'd the Army.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who had his Spies upon every Motion of the King,
intercepts theſe Letters, and reſolved never to truſt the King
again; yet doubted that he could not manage his Deſigns, if the
King were ſo near the Parliament and City as <hi>Hampton-Court:</hi>
therefore <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſent to the King, <hi>That he was in no Safety at</hi>
Hampton-Court, <hi>by reaſon of the Hatred which the Adjutators had
to him, and that he would be in more Safety in the Iſle of</hi> Wight.
Hereupon the King, upon the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> (while the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners were debating the King's Anſwer
to their Propoſitions) at Night made his Eſcape, having Poſt-Horſes,
and a Ship provided for him at <hi>Southampton,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
only with Sir <hi>John Berkley,</hi> Colonel <hi>Leg,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Aſhburnham,</hi>
and came to the Iſle of <hi>Wight;</hi> which would morally have been
impoſſible, if <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Agents had not put the King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
                     <p>But how concealedly ſoever <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Son-in-law <hi>Ireton</hi>
had carried the Buſineſs of the King's Eſcape to the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi>
yet the Adjutators had ſome Jealouſy upon them, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to have the King eſtabliſh'd; and poſſeſt the Soldiers with
much Prejudice againſt them. <hi>Fairfax</hi> doubting the Event of theſe
Practices, diſmiſt the Adjutators to their ſeveral Regiments, and
ſent moſt of their Officers to their ſeveral Charges, and appointed
a General Rendezvouz of the Army at <hi>Cork-buſh-field</hi> between <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
and <hi>Ware,</hi> upon the <hi>14th;</hi> which the Adjutators endeavour'd
to have prevented. The next Day many Soldiers, of five whole
Regiments, mutiny'd againſt their Officers, and wore Marks of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
to be known from the reſt. <hi>Cromwel, Ireton,</hi> and ſome
other of the Officers, ſtruck at by the Adjutators, were very active
in ſuppreſſing them, and ſeized upon ſome of the principal Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers,
and one or two of them were ſhot before their Troops
were reduced; and moſt of the Mutineers, and the Officers which
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:60932:166"/>
favoured them, were tried at Court-Martials, and caſhier'd; and
three of them condemned to die. And for this <hi>Cromwel</hi> had the
Thanks of the Houſe: but it will not be long before they ſhall
find little Joy of it.</p>
                     <p>From the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> the King, upon <hi>October</hi> the <hi>18th,</hi> ſent

                     <p>Theſe Votes were ſo pleaſing to the Army, that it was declar'd
by a Council of War the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>January, That they reſolved to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to preſerve the Peerage and Rights, and the Rights of the

Yet within little more than a Year, the <hi>Rump,</hi> ſet up by

uſeleſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Here ſee what a Labyrinth Men run into when they forſake the
Paths of Juſtice! for as</hi> Socrates <hi>ſays,</hi> Plato Eutiphro, If Men in
Diſſenſion will not ſubmit to ſome certain Rule which may determine
them, their Diſſenſions will be endleſs: and that the Will of the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:60932:166"/>
Gods, if it be divided, cannot be the Rule to determine Juſtice; for
Men in obeying one God, may diſobey another.</p>
                     <p>If therefore the Laws and Conſtitutions of the Nation may not
be the Rule which may determine the Controverſies between the
King, the Members, the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Army, then nothing can;
for elſe, what pleaſed one would diſpleaſe the other.</p>
                     <p>The King would gladly have had the Law to have determined
the Controverſies; for this would have veſted him in his Royal
Power, and by the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> 7. would have juſtified all his
Subjects who fought for him. But the Members would not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to this, being to diveſt themſelves of the Power they thought
they had in their hands; nor the <hi>Scots,</hi> becauſe their Solemn
League and Covenant was enacted by no Law in <hi>England;</hi> nor
leaſt of all would it pleaſe the Army, who nouriſhed Deſigns
againſt the King, Members, and <hi>Scots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To ſuch a deplorable ſtate is this poor King and Kingdom fall'n,
paſt all humane Relief! yet it's admirable, to conſider how Divine
Juſtice purſued the Cauſers of it, even in the Series by which
they were promoted. The King, who would not have the Laws
and Conſtitutions of the Nation to be the Rules of his Subjects
Obedience, but his Prerogative, and Abſolute Will and Pleaſure,
cannot now by it command one Servant: He who before, againſt
Law, committed ſo many of his beſt Subjects cloſe Priſoners, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſeveral died in Priſon, for aſſerting his Subjects Rights, without
any Benefit of Law, is now, by his Subjects, made cloſe Priſoner
againſt Law, and without any Benefit of it: He who before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
four Parliaments, becauſe they in all dutiful Ways would
have addreſſed unto him to be reconciled to his Subjects, is now
denied, under Penalty of High Treaſon, to have any Addreſs
made to him by any of his Subjects: He who before had ſo many
Foreſts for his Pleaſure, yet not contented with what the Law
and his Anceſtors had left, but would break the Bounds of them,
that his Subjects Inheritance might become a Prey to wild Beaſts,
has not now a Horſe, Hound, or Beaſt, to take Pleaſure in. But
theſe things will not ſtay here; for it is the unhappy Fate of
Princes, rarely in their declining ſtate to ſtay till they fall to the
bottom. And here we end the Year 1647; and hereafter ſhall
obſerve the Divine Juſtice overtaking the other Promoters of the
Miſeries both in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> And if I ſhall
ill perform it, yet it may be a Ground-work for another to do it
better.</p>
                     <p>In this Confuſion the Nation began to forget the times under
the King's Government, now they ſaw no end of theſe: And tho
the <hi>Eſſex</hi>-Men, who had the Bounds of their Foreſts broke down,
and were the firſt who petition'd the Parliament to redreſs Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
and bring Delinquents to condign Puniſhment, yet they
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:60932:167"/>
are now the firſt who petition the Commons for a Perſonal Treaty
with the King, and then the <hi>Surrey</hi>-Men; but were differently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and ſome of the <hi>Surrey</hi>-Men kill'd. This was in <hi>May,
1648.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> too, offended that they and their Solemn League and
Covenant were not taken notice of in the Preliminary Treaty
with the King, call a Parliament, and order the Raiſing an Army
to deliver the King out of Priſon.</p>
                     <p>The rude Entertainment of the <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Surrey</hi>-Men, was ſo
far from quelling them, that they riſe in Arms in <hi>Eſſex, Kent,
Suffolk, Norfolk, Wales,</hi> and the <hi>North,</hi> and declare for the King
and People: Sir <hi>William Batton</hi> too, who was Vice-Admiral of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, goes over to Prince <hi>Charles</hi> with 17 Men of War,
and declare for the King, having ſet <hi>Rainsborough</hi> (made Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

purſues them, and after a ſtubborn Siege of 11 Weeks, forces

                     <p>Equal to this, was the Succeſs of the <hi>Surrey</hi>-Men; for they
were routed by Sir <hi>Michael Leweſly,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Francis</hi> killed
near <hi>Kingston:</hi> But the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
with thoſe which were eſcaped, fled over <hi>Kingston-bridg,</hi>
and were purſued by Colonel <hi>Scroop,</hi> and overtaken at <hi>St. Neots,</hi>

Priſoner, but the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> eſcaped.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Northern</hi>-Men, beſieged in <hi>Pontfract Caſtle,</hi> are not ſo

<hi>Doncaſter,</hi> about 12 Miles from <hi>Pontfract,</hi> and kill him, becauſe
he refuſed to be carried off a Priſoner; but <hi>Pure Famine</hi> at laſt
forced the Beſieged to ſurrender.</p>
                     <p>The revolted Fleet, now commanded by the Princes <hi>Rupert</hi> and
<hi>Maurice,</hi> partly cajol'd by the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> their former Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,
and unwilling to forſake their Country, Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
in great part return to the Parliament; the reſt were
after purſued by <hi>Blake</hi> and <hi>Popham</hi> to <hi>Ireland,</hi> from thence to

                     <p>Whilſt the Army was thus buſied abroad, the Members having
got poſſeſſion of the Fleet, and the City of <hi>London</hi> being well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

the Votes of Non-Addreſſes to the King; and in <hi>September</hi>
appoint a Conference with the King at <hi>Newport</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi>
to continue for 40 Days; and to that purpoſe, take the King out of
Priſon, and allow him the Liberty of the Iſland: and the King
upon the Matter, with Reluctancy enough, grants the <hi>Scots</hi> and
Members their own Demands.</p>
                     <p>But neither the Laws and Conſtitutions of the Nation, nor the
Endeavours of his Loyal Subjects, nor the joint Deſires of the
<hi>Scots</hi> and Members, who had brought the King to this Condition,
could protect this unhappy Prince from his approaching Ruin:
for the Army, every where victorious over the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Royaliſts,</hi>
draw together, and make a <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> againſt all Peace with the
King; that Juſtice may be done upon him; that the Crown and

                     <p>But the Members were intent upon the King's Anſwer to their

take as a ſlighting of them, and then ſeized the King in the Iſle

were to meet again, they found all the Avenues to the Houſe beſet
with Soldiers, who exclude all which were not of their Faction
from entring the Houſe, which were not one fourth part, and
make the Reſidue Priſoners.</p>
                     <p>So that if the Mayor, Sir <hi>John Gage,</hi> and the Aldermen his
Brethren, were guilty of High Treaſon for committing a Force up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> for continuing the Militia of <hi>London</hi> in the
City the Year before, how much more was it High-Treaſon in
<hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Agents, to keep back by Force three Fourths
of the Members from entring the Houſe, and making them Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
that the Rumps of the reſt might do his Journey-work?</p>
                     <p>So farewel <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and all the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Trumpery in <hi>England:</hi>
nor ſhall theſe ſecluded Members ever meet more, but to diſſolve
themſelves and make room for another Parliament, which ſhall
legally perſecute them, and their <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> as
much as they by it perſecuted the King, and their fellow Subjects,
againſt Law. Nor was <hi>Presbytery</hi> much longer liv'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
where they ſhall never ſee it reſtored by this now Race of Kings,
which ſhall plague them with the Exerciſe of Archbiſhops and
Biſhops, which by their Covenant they are ſworn to aboliſh; and
cut off the Head of the principal of their Faction, allowing them
as little place for the Exerciſe of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> as they now do the
<hi>Epiſcopal Party.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having, tho but in Epitome, ſeen the various Accidents in
War, whereby the King came to be in this Diſtreſs, before we
declare his End, and the manner of it, it's fit, in ſhort, to take
notice of the ſeveral Treaties of Peace between the King and
Parliament, and the Improbability of the good Succeſs in any of
them.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Propoſitions for Peace which the Parliament ſent to the
King, was <hi>June</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> when the King was at <hi>York,</hi> before the
War broke out, which were Nineteen; which you may read at
larger in Sir <hi>Richard Baker,</hi> f. 518. <hi>a. b.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="329" facs="tcp:60932:168"/>
In theſe Propoſitions no mention is made either of the <hi>Scots</hi>
Covenant, or aboliſhing Epiſcopacy; yet ſome of them were ſo
inconſiſtent with <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and Arbitrary in the Parliament,
as the King in Honour and Conſcience could not condeſcend to
them.</p>
                     <p>I ſay the King could not in Honour or Conſcience condeſcend to
the <hi>9th</hi> Propoſition, 15 and 16 Propoſitions, to ſettle the <hi>Militia</hi>
as the Parliament have ordered <hi>(without the King)</hi> That all Forts
and Caſtles of the Kingdom be diſpoſed of by the Parliament (viz.
<hi>The Houſes)</hi> and that the King diſcharge all his Guards and Forces,
and not to raiſe any but in caſe of actual Rebellion. <hi>But how could
this be done by the King, when the Militia and Forts of the Kingdom
were in the Power of the Houſes?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So here the King, who by Virtue of his Office, is obliged to
preſerve the Laws and Conſtitutions of the Nation, and to ſuppreſs
all Diſturbers of them at home, and to defend the Nation from all
Foreign Invaſion, has no means to do any of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Objection.</hi> But the King had ſo often violated the Laws and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of the Nation, by being armed with theſe Powers, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
could be in no Safety, if they were continued in him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It's true, the Nation was in a very calamitous Eſtate
herein: But if the Members had only made it their Buſineſs how
to have reſtrained the King herein, and to have preſerved the Laws
and Conſtitutions of the Nation, it would have had another Face
than now, when the Members are ſetting up themſelves to do the
ſame thing which they feared the King ſhould act.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, the King could not in Honour or Conſcience agree to the
<hi>13th</hi> Propoſition, <hi>That the Juſtice of Parliament (viz.</hi> the Members)
<hi>ſhould paſs upon all Delinquents, and they to appear and abide by their
Cenſure:</hi> For Delinquent is a Word unknown to our Laws, and ſo
equivocal, that it may ſignify whatever the Members pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>So that if the King had agreed to theſe Propoſitions, he would
have been a King that could neither have executed Juſtice, nor
ſhewed Mercy; and the Houſes have an unlimited Arbitrary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to do whatever they pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To the Propoſitions the King returns a ſharp Anſwer,</hi> That the
Houſes contrary to Law, had preſſed their Ordinances upon the People,
wreſted from him the Command of the Militia; countenanced the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>Hotham,</hi> and had directed to the People Invectives againſt his
Government, and aſperſt him with favouring Papiſts; and therefore
proteſted, that if he were utterly vanquiſhed and a Priſoner, in a worſe
Condition than any of his moſt unfortunate Predeceſſors had ever been
reduced to, he would never ſtoop ſo low as to grant theſe Demands, and
to make himſelf of a King of <hi>England</hi> a Duke of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="330" facs="tcp:60932:169"/>
But when the Covenanters in <hi>Scotland</hi> ſent their Propoſition
to his Majeſty, he returned Anſwer, he would rather die than ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to them, and from a King of <hi>England</hi> make himſelf a Duke of
<hi>Venice:</hi> Yet the next Year of his own Accord went into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and by Act of Parliament granted the Covenanters all they deſired,
(which yet perplext all the ſubſequent Treaties of Peace in <hi>England)</hi>
and more, as the Caſe now ſtood.</p>
                     <p>The next Treaty was at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the beginning of 1643,
which broke off the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> and nothing agreed to upon
this Score: The Parliament Commiſſioners gave ſuch Reaſons for
the King to aſſent to one of the moſt material Points of the
Treaty, that the King aſſented to it; but being 12 a Clock at
Night, it could not then be reduced to Writing, but he promiſed
it ſhould next Morning, when the King gave them a Paper quite
contrary; whereupon the Treaty broke off. See <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs,
f. 65. a. b.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For in the next Treaty at <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridg,</hi> which was in <hi>December,
1644,</hi> the Parliament not only inſiſted, that the King's Nephews,
<hi>Rupert</hi> and <hi>Maurice,</hi> though Princes Foreign born, and ſo no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to the King of <hi>England,</hi> but many of the principal Lords and
Gentry, who aſſiſted the King in this War, and who by the <hi>11
Hen.</hi> 7. 18. were protected for aſſiſting the King, ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
out of Pardon by an Act of Indempnity; which if they
had had no Law to have protected them, yet the King could not
in Conſcience have offered them up a Sacrifice for aſſiſting him.</p>
                     <p>But another Difficulty aroſe in this Treaty, which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would have impoſed upon the King, contrary to the Laws
and Conſtitutions of the Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> To extirpate <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi>
and to impoſe the <hi>Scots</hi> Covenant and Directory upon the Nation,
though the Biſhops were excluded their Sitting in the Houſe of
Lords, by an Act in 1641, and none in Orders to exerciſe any
Civil Office: So that the Houſes not content with what had been
already granted, but graſping at more, they loſt all; for in the
firſt Parliament, <hi>Car.</hi> 2. they were reſtored to their Seats in
Parliament again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Objection.</hi> But if Epiſcopacy were <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> as the King
was informed by his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops; and therefore the King
could not in Conſcience ſubmit to the aboliſhing of it; then it is
<hi>Jure Divino</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well as <hi>England;</hi> and if the King of
his own Accord, could go out of <hi>England,</hi> to aboliſh it in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
Why ſhould the King againſt the Advice of both Nations, not do
the ſame in <hi>England?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> He that ſhall anſwer for all the Actions of this Prince,
ſhall have a great Task: Nor can I give any other Anſwer to it, than
that becauſe a Man has done an ill Act, it ſhall be a Precedent to him
to do it again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="331" facs="tcp:60932:169"/>
But if the King ſhould have conſented to aboliſh Epiſcopacy
in <hi>England,</hi> and ſet up Presbytery, I do not ſee any Benefit the
King could have reaped by it, according to the Covenanters Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
and Principles: For, if the <hi>Scots</hi> (after the King had aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Epiſcopacy in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſet up Presbytery there, and that
the <hi>Scots</hi> had thereupon promiſed all Obedience to the King in
time to come; and declared by Act of Parliament, <hi>That it was
deteſtable and damnable Treaſon in the higheſt Degree, for any of the</hi>
Scots <hi>Nation either conjunctly or ſingly, to levy Arms, or any Military
Forces upon any Pretence whatſoever, without the King's Command)</hi>
could raiſe Arms, unprovoked by the King, and againſt his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Command, and invade <hi>England;</hi> why ſhould the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Covenanters, after the King ſhould have aboliſhed Epiſcopacy in
<hi>England,</hi> be more obliged to perform any Agreement they made
with the King in <hi>England,</hi> then the <hi>Scots</hi> Covenanters were in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the King deſired the <hi>Scots</hi> Parliament, upon the breaking
out of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Maſſacre and Rebellion, to aſſiſt him againſt the
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> they refuſed, becauſe <hi>Ireland</hi> was not ſubject to <hi>Scotland;</hi>
and tho <hi>England</hi> be not ſubject to <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet the <hi>Scots,</hi> againſt
the King's Command, can aſſiſt by Arms the Parliament againſt
him: So that if the Covenant could entitle the <hi>Scots</hi> to be ſo
falſe, perfidious and treacherous to the King after he had aboliſhed
Epiſcopacy in <hi>Scotland;</hi> Why ſhould not this be a Precedent for
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Covenanters to be ſo in <hi>England,</hi> after the King ſhould
aboliſh Epiſcopacy in it, and eſtabliſh Presbytery?</p>
                     <p>The Overtures for a Treaty at <hi>Oxford</hi> in <hi>November</hi> 1644, prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that at <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridg,</hi> whence, upon the King's Deſire, it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed,
and Paſſes reciprocally of ſafe Conduct were granted to
Commiſſioners on both ſides to meet the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> wherein
the Commiſſioners from <hi>Scotland</hi> were included.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners being included in this Treaty, you
need not doubt but their principal Care ſhall be to eſtabliſh their
Solemn League and Covenant, and the Presbyterian Government
as firm in <hi>England</hi> as in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and to this end, <hi>the three firſt
days were ſet apart for Religion, three other Days for the Militia, and
three other days for the Settlement of</hi> Ireland.</p>
                     <p>How humble ſoever the <hi>Scots</hi> were (if you'll take their Word)
yet the firſt Debate aroſe between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
concerning Precedence, which you may read in <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s
<hi>Memoirs, f. 122. a. b.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But when the Buſineſs concerning Religion came to be debated,
nothing leſs than that Presbytery was <hi>Jure Divino</hi> would down with
the <hi>Scots;</hi> nor was Epiſcopacy leſs <hi>Jure Divino</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Commiſſioners for Religion. But both theſe Aſſertions are falſe
and blaſphemous, for <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> is ſo inſeparably inherent in
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:60932:170"/>
God, as cannot be communicated to any Creature: and though
God by Divine Law or Inſtitution did impower Biſhops and Prieſts
with Epiſcopal and Prieſtly Power, to perform their Offices de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
by God, for the planting and continuing the Goſpel; yet the
<hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> from whence theſe Inſtitutions were derived, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
the ſame in God as before. As God by the Law of Nature
gives Parents a Dominion over their Children, and Husbands o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Wives; yet the Divine Right which gives theſe Powers,
is the ſame as before; and Parents and Husbands have no Divine
Right hereby, but a Temporal Right by Nature, or the Law of
Nature: ſo Biſhops and Prieſts have no Divine Right to exerciſe
their Ghoſtly Powers, but a Spiritual Right given them by God's
Law or Inſtitution, ſupernaturally or extraordinarily given. If
Biſhops and Prieſts had a Divine Right, they might create Divine
Laws, which <hi>in Terminis</hi> I believe none of them will affirm:
However you may ſee how the <hi>Theologues</hi> (as they call themſelves)
impoſe by this Cant upon the World; and what endleſs Diſcords,
Factions and Wars have been raiſed hereby, no Man converſant
in Hiſtory can be ignorant of. The Principal whereof was Dr.
<hi>Steward,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henderſon</hi> and <hi>Marſhall</hi> for Presbytery: but the
Zeal on both Parts being ſo obſtinate, as well as contradictory,
would have taken up more than all their Time in theſe Broils, if
a Stop had not been put to them upon the Motion of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
of <hi>Hartford,</hi> on the King's Part, and the Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> and other Commiſſioners, on the Parliament's; that
they might proceed upon the other Points of the Militia and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In both theſe there was as little Agreement as in that of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not any one Point being agreed to by the King's Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
ſo the Treaty ended, and nothing concluded.</p>
                     <p>The other Treaties at <hi>New-Caſtle, Hampton-Court,</hi> and the Iſle
of <hi>Wight,</hi> we have taken notice of before. So that the King was
as unſucceſsful in his Treaties, as in his Arms.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of this Tragedy reſolves into the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
for this <hi>Juncto,</hi> after called the <hi>Rump-Parliament,</hi> having thus
purged the Houſe, aſſume to themſelves the Supream Power of
Ordering the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Affairs; confirm the Vote of <hi>Non-Addreſſes</hi>
to the King, and raze the Votes of having a Conference with the
King, and the Declaration that the King's Conceſſions were a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Ground for a Peace, out of the Journals of the Houſe: And
vote, firſt, that all Power reſides in the People: Secondly, That
the Power belongs to the Peoples Repreſentatives in the Houſe of
Commons: Thirdly, That the Votes of the Commons have the
Force of a Law without the King: Fourthly, That to take Arms
againſt the Repreſentatives of the People, or the Parliament,
is High-Treaſon: Fifthly, That the King himſelf took up
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:60932:170"/>
Arms againſt the Parliament, and therefore is guilty of all the
Blood ſhed in this Civil War, and ought by his own Blood to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
it.</p>
                     <p>The Nation was aſtoniſhed at theſe Votes: for the Perſon of the
King of <hi>England</hi> was ever eſteemed Sacred; and therefore tho
his Miniſters were always accountable in Parliament for uſing, or
abuſing the Name of the King, to gratify their Ambition and
wicked Deſigns againſt the King or Kingdom, yet in no time was
any King of <hi>England</hi> arraigned and judged to die by his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
and tho <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, <hi>Henry</hi>
the Sixth, and <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth were murdered by wicked Men,
yet none of theſe ſuffered upon pretence of Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>But lame-footed Vengeance ſhall overtake both Rump and Army,
and as they both joined by Force to impoſe theſe upon the King
and Nation, ſo both without Force, or any Man kill'd in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
ſhall be caſhier'd with all imaginable Ignominy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
Theſe Men, whom nothing but the King's and his Loyal
Subjects Blood could ſatiate againſt Law, ſhall by Law have their
own Blood ſhed in the moſt terrible manner the Law can inflict:
theſe Men who would have the Crown and Church-Lands for
their Avarice, ſhall either die or be hang'd as a Company of
Beggars: <hi>Richard Cromwel, Oliver</hi>'s Heir, being undone to pay the
Charge of his Father's Funeral; or thoſe who had Eſtates ſhall
forfeit them, to encreaſe the Revenues of the Crown.</p>
                     <p>The Regicides, to put the beſt Face they could upon this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious
Act, ſend the Bill for Trial of the King up to the Lords
for their Concurrence; but ſo far were the Lords from concurring,
that they threw the Bill over the Bar: Hereupon the Rump vote
the Lords dangerous and uſeleſs; yet <hi>Henry Martin</hi> ſaid, they were
uſeleſs, but not dangerous. Then the Rumpers adviſe with the
Judges about the Trial of the King, who unanimouſly declare it
againſt Law, and the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners proteſt againſt it. But
neither Authority, Law nor Reaſon, would take place with thoſe
Men; ſo they erect a new Court never heard of before, called a
<hi>High Court of Juſtice for the Trial of the King,</hi> to conſiſt of (I
think) Seventy, two thirds of which were Souldiers, who by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the King to Death expected the Reward of the Inheritance
both of the Crown and Church.</p>
                     <p>If it be Miſery to have been happy, to what a miſerable State
have theſe curſed Minions, Flatterers and Sycophants brought one
of the greateſt and moſt high-born Princes in the Weſtern World,
to gratify their Ambition, Luſt and Avarice? for this Prince
whom they would have to rend his Subjects from their Laws, has
now no Subjects who dare protect him by the Laws: He who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſo often gloried, that to him alone belonged the Power of
Proroguing, Adjourning and Diſſolving Parliaments, who never did
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:60932:171"/>
him Wrong, but met to aſſiſt him againſt thoſe who wronged
him, and to have reconciled him to his Subjects, has now no Power
to diſſolve this Rump of a Parliament which will not be reconciled
to him: He who before ſo often called his truly Loyal Subjects,
Undutiful, Seditious and Vipers, (Terms unuſual in Princes) ſhall
hear himſelf call'd Tyrant, Murderer, and Traitor, by his impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Subjects: He who before ſo often gloried, he was only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
to God for all his Actions, ſhall be now called to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
by a company of Men, for Actions whereof they themſelves
were much more guilty, and be ſent to God to paſs his Accounts
there alſo.</p>
                     <p>For upon the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> the King was haled before this
Aſſembly, where he was charged of Treaſon, Tyranny and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
for raiſing War againſt the Parliament and People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
Tho it's evident the Members ſeiz'd the Militia, the Tower
of <hi>London,</hi> and Fleet, which Powers were inherent in the King,
and ſhut him out of <hi>Hull,</hi> and granted Commiſſions for levying
Souldiers before the King ſet up his Standard at <hi>Nottingham.</hi> But
admit the King did firſt raiſe Arms to have forced the Parliament,
and firſt actually ſet up his Standard againſt them, and that was a
Crime, yet was the Regicides Crime greater, who had forced the
Parliament, and ſet up themſelves inſtead of it.</p>
                     <p>The King, now too late, flies to the Laws of the Land for his
Protection, proteſts againſt the Juriſdiction of the Court, as eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by no Legal Authority, and declares his Life was not ſo
dear to him as his Honour and Conſcience, and the Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of his People, and that he will loſe his Life, rather than
ſubmit to ſuch a Tyrannical Court. And at laſt the King deſired
to be heard before the Lords and Commons, in ſome things which
concerned the Peace of the Kingdom, and Liberty of the Subjects:
but this too was denied: And ſo the <hi>4th</hi> day after this Appearance,
<hi>Bradſhaw</hi> the Preſident gave Sentence upon him to loſe his Head,
all the Court to the number of 67, owning it by ſtanding up:
Which Sentence was executed the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>January.</hi>

                     <head>The Character of King Charles the Firſt.</head>
                     <p>THus fell one of the greateſt and moſt high-born Princes of the
Weſtern World. In his Perſon he was ſomewhat more than
ordinarily tall, and the Compoſition of it was framed in moſt exact
natural Proportion of Parts; ſo that he was very active, and of a fine
Mein in his Motion, which was commonly more than ordinarily
faſt: yet he appeared beſt on Horſe-back, and excelled in managing
his Horſe; ſo that when he was in <hi>Spain,</hi> in ſight of the King,
Queen, the Infanta's, and the Infanta <hi>Maria,</hi> whom he courted,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:60932:171"/>
or at leaſt ſeemed to do ſo) and innumerable other Spectators, he
took the Ring in his firſt Courſe. His Viſage was long, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
beſt when he did not ſpeak; for he had a natural Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his Speech, and would often ſtutter in it, eſpecially when
he was in Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>To theſe Natural Endowments may be added, a Temperance in
Eating and Drinking, and Chaſtity (tho his Enemies unjuſtly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
him otherways) rarely to be found in Princes. He was
born in <hi>Scotland,</hi> about two Years before his Father became King of
<hi>England;</hi> and being bred from his Infancy in a moſt luxurious and
flattering Court, tho he avoided the Luxury of it, yet the Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of it took ſuch deep Root in him, that he would never permit
free Counſel to take any Impreſſion in him. In his Nature he was
over parſimonious, ill becoming ſo great a Prince.</p>
                     <p>He laid the Foundation of an unhappy Reign before he became
King, not only in his Diſſimulation in the Treaty of Marriage
with the King and Infanta of <hi>Spain,</hi> to the Diſpleaſure of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but much more in the French Treaty, not only in ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to grant a Toleration of the Popiſh Religion, and that his
Children ſhould be brought up under their Mother till they were
twelve Years old, but by engaging to aſſiſt the French King with a
Fleet againſt the Reformed in <hi>France,</hi> which he did, tho the French
broke their Faith, in denying <hi>Mansfield</hi> to land the Army at <hi>Calais</hi>
raiſed for the Recovery of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Unlike his Predeceſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>or <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, who ſo ſoon as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
King, baniſhed all his Flatterers and looſe Companions, and
betaking himſelf to grave and wiſe Counſel, he became the moſt
Renowned and Victorious of all our Engliſh Kings: <hi>Charles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
more wilful, and gave himſelf to be more governed by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
after he became King than before: So that the inſite Piety
and Affection which is due to Parents, and uſually expreſt in
ſome mournful Demeanour upon their Death, took no Impreſſion
in him after his Father's Death; but contrary Paſſions againſt his
Father's Counſel and Will prevailed upon him: For next day after
his Father's Death, only the King and <hi>Buckingham</hi> preſent, the
Keeper, <hi>Williams,</hi> coming to wait upon him; the King asked him
whether the Parliament were diſſolved upon his Father's Death?
Which when the Keeper told him it was, the King commanded
him to iſſue out new Summons for calling another, and not to
ſtay a day, for Subſidies muſt be had for carrying on a War againſt
<hi>Spain:</hi> and when the Keeper adviſed him to conſider a little here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and that before Writs were iſſued out, Intereſt ſhould be made
about Elections, the King in Diſpleaſure turn'd from him: Which
you may read in the ſecond Book and ſecond Folio of the Keeper's
Life. And theſe two things were obſervable in this Prince, That
when any adviſed him againſt his Will, he would never ask it after,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:60932:172"/>
or be Friends with him; and that in all his Reign, as well in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
as in Adverſity, he would never own any one of his Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities
to be ſo, but juſtified them all to his Death.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Henry</hi> was the moſt ſelf-denying of all his glorious Actions,
aſcribing them only to God; ſo <hi>Charles</hi> upon all occaſions in all his
irregular Actions, gloried he was accountable to none but God for
them.</p>
                     <p>After he was married, he became the moſt uxorious Husband of
all our Engliſh Kings, except <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth; and being intangled
by the Articles of Marriage, which the Queen foſtered, and the
Laws and Conſtitutions of the Nation contrary to them, which his
Parliaments ſtedfaſtly aſſerted, he became both ways uneaſy, and
to reconcile them was impoſſible. But to me it ſeems, how uxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ſoever the King was, yet during <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Regency (for
ſo it may be truly called) he had an Aſcendency over the Queen,
as appears by the French War in the ſecond Year of the King,
notwithſtanding all the Power of the Queen againſt it.</p>
                     <p>He was unaffable in his Converſation, and Approaches to him
very difficult, and thoſe with ſuch ſtrained Submiſſions as were
never required by any of his Predeceſſors. As his Actions were
without Counſel, ſudden, and inconſiderate; ſo were his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as variable and uncertain, ſo that oftentimes he would
change them the ſame day: And as his Actions were without
Counſel, ſo were his Deſigns without Secrecy, which blaſted them
as well at Home as Abroad.</p>
                     <p>He was ſo ſuperſtitiouſly addicted to the <hi>Arminian</hi> Clergy,
which flatter'd him, that I do not find, except <hi>Juxton</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>London,</hi> that he preferr'd any others in the Church, till he fell into
Adverſity.</p>
                     <p>In his adverſe Fortune he would betake himſelf to contrary
Extreams, yet be as inconſtant in them as in his Actions in Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
He was only conſtant in his Affections to the Queen, (after
he had given up his Favourites in his proſperous Fortune to the
Parliament) and her Counſels fixed ſtedfaſt in him, tho in his
Declarations to the Kingdom and Parliament he profeſs'd other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
and herein he was as unhappy as he was before in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
in his Proſperity; for they, whether by Fate or his own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence,
became known to his Enemies, who blaz'd them abroad,
not only to the Nation, but all the World: ſo that the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Promiſes and Declarations became ſuſpected as well by
his Friends as Enemies, and all Accommodation with them more
difficult; whereby it came to paſs that his Armies being ſubdued
by them, and thereby falling into the Hands of his Enemies, he
became a Sacrifice to them in the <hi>49th</hi> Year of his Age, having
reigned 23 Years, ten Months, and three Days, leaving ſix Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
three Sons, <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales, James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
                        <pb n="337" facs="tcp:60932:172"/>
and <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> whereof the two elder were Exiles;
and three Daughters, <hi>Mary</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> a
Virgin, who not long ſurvived him, and <hi>Henrietta Maria</hi> born at
<hi>Exeter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that as King <hi>John,</hi> and his Son <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, loſt all <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
and the greateſt part of <hi>Aquitain</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
a more than Legal Juriſdiction over their Subjects,
whereby they loſt their Love and Obedience; ſo theſe two Princes,
Father and Son, by raiſing and Arbitrary Power over their Subjects,
not only loſt their Honour Abroad, but with their own Subjects,
(and for want of whoſe Aſſiſtance this King loſt his Life) and
ſuffered the <hi>French</hi> to grow ſo great, as to endanger the Safety
of their own Subjects in the Realms of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and
<hi>Ireland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I'll conclude this Story with one which a learned Gentleman
who liv'd in thoſe Times affirmed: When the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was ſtabb'd by <hi>Felton,</hi> 1628, the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi> was then
newly made Lord Treaſurer; and the King to manifeſt his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Duke, order'd the Treaſurer to iſſue out of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
30000 <hi>l.</hi> I think, for a ſolemn Funeral for the Duke: but
the Treaſurer unwilling the King ſhould be at ſo hateful an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
at a time when the King was at War with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi>
told the King, that the Sum laid out in erecting a ſtately Tomb
for the Duke, would be a more laſting Monument of his Favour
to the Duke, than a Funeral-Expence, which would be but the
Work of a Day, and ſoon forgot: The King aſſented, and ſeveral
Patterns were brought, and what the King lik'd the Treaſurer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik'd,
till at laſt the King pitch'd upon one, which he ſaid he
would have; but then the Treaſurer ſaid, <hi>Sir, what will the World
ſay, that you ſhould be at ſuch an Expence for a Favourite, when
your Father has not a Stone to cover him?</hi> which ſtruck the King
ſo, as he proceeded no farther in it. I remember (I think it
was in 1669.) that the Commons voted 50000 <hi>l.</hi> for the Charge
of taking up this King's Body, and the ſolemn Funeral of it,
and to have a Monument for it; but as if it had been blaſted
by Fate, it was not done, King <hi>Charles</hi> his Son, they ſay, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it.</p>
                     <p>As to the State of the Nation, in reference to our Foreign
Neighbour Nations, at the Death of King <hi>Charles,</hi> we ſhall find
the <hi>Dutch</hi> making their Advantage of the Engliſh Diſſenſions, as
before they did of the eaſy and remiſs Nature of King <hi>James,</hi>
when in the Year 1618, they ſeiz'd upon the Iſland of <hi>Amboyna,</hi>
and expell'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> thence, to ſay no worſe: For Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Courten</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul Pindar,</hi> at the deſire of King <hi>Charles,</hi>
had fitted out two Ship fraighted with our Native Commodities
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:60932:173"/>
to endeavour an Eſtabliſhment of a Trade to <hi>China,</hi> where our
Cloths were much more uſeful than in the Trade to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi>
where the Trade is carried on in the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> and ſo
our Cloths of little uſe; whereas the North and middle Parts
of <hi>China</hi> are either cold or temperate, and ſo our Cloths of great
uſe there, and deſirable by the Natives. At this time the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
had no <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, but the Trade was free to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
as that to <hi>Spain</hi> then was, and ſo now is; nor was the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Company incorporated till the Year 1657, by <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel.</hi>
The Ships which Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul Pindar</hi>
fitted and fraighted out, wherein the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and I
have heard, the Earls of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Warwick</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
one was called the <hi>Bona Eſperanza,</hi> the other the <hi>Henry
Bonadventura,</hi> which made a more hopeful Voyage to <hi>China,</hi> than
can be expected to any Place in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Dutch,</hi> as jealous of a Partner in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, as a
Dotard is of a fair Wife, the Pope of his Triple Crown, or the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> of his <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> ſet out, without any Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of War, two Men of War under the Command of one <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to intercept theſe Merchant-Men in the return of their Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
homeward; and met with the <hi>Bona Eſperanza</hi> between <hi>Goa</hi>
and <hi>Maccao,</hi> in the <hi>Straits</hi> of <hi>Malacca,</hi> and take her with all her
Cargo, and carry her to <hi>Batavia,</hi> and there (without any legal
Proceſs) confiſcate the Ship and all her Lading; this was in the
Year 1643. And alſo the ſame Year they ſeize the other Ship
the <hi>Henry Bonadventura</hi> near the Iſland of <hi>Mauritius,</hi> which, with
all her Cargo, the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſeized, nor ever made any Reſtitution of
either to this day. How well King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second vindicated
his Subjects herein will hereafter appear; and how impoſſible it
became for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to retrieve this Trade after <hi>Oliver</hi> had
eſtabliſhed the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company excluſive to all other <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Men, is obvious to any Man: But what can't Queen-Money, and
a company of—do?</p>
                     <p>It was now above thirteen Years ſince the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in the Year
1635, entertain'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fled from <hi>Laud</hi> and <hi>Wren</hi>'s Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whereby they acquired the Art of making the Woollen
Manufactury of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> which before the <hi>Dutch</hi>
knew not; and the Wars in <hi>England</hi> breaking out, the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
did not ſo fully ſupply the Countries within the <hi>Sound,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and then the <hi>Dutch</hi> were rather Interlopers, than Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors
in the Trade of Woollen Manufacturies to thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
                     <p>This want of Supply put the <hi>Sileſians</hi> and <hi>Polanders</hi> upon a
Neceſſity of being ſupplied other ways, and making a Vertue of
Neceſſity, got Artificers to inſtruct the Natives of <hi>Sileſia,</hi> and
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:60932:173"/>
the Werſtern Parts of <hi>Poland,</hi> by compounding the Wools of
<hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Sileſia,</hi> to make a coarſe ſort of Cloths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> called <hi>Sleſys,</hi>
which clad the poorer and ordinary ſort of the Inhabitants,
whereby the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to this day have loſt the Trade of coarſe
Cloths to theſe Places, which before they ſolely enjoy'd. This
was one Reaſon that the <hi>Dutch</hi> became Competitors with the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> in the other Trades for Woollen Manufactures within the
<hi>Sound.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For tho the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures were much better, and
could be ſold cheaper than the <hi>Dutch;</hi> yet the <hi>Dutch</hi> Navigation
for foreign Vent, was manifoldly cheaper, and more convenient
than the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in regard of the Conveniency of their build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ships proper for all Trades, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
not; for a <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſel of like Dimenſions, beſides the
convenience of building, is built near half cheaper than the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
can, and then is navigated with leſs than two thirds of the
Hands.</p>
                     <p>To this Cheapneſs of Shipping and Navigation, is added the
Advantage the <hi>Dutch</hi> have above the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in compunding
Fraights in this Navigation; for all the Countries within the
<hi>Sound</hi> ſtand in need of Salt, and covet drinking Wines and
Brandy: Theſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> not only import, by the Cheapneſs
of Navigation, cheaper than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> can, but paying little
or no Cuſtoms upon their Importation, can vend them ſo much
cheaper in their Trades into the <hi>Sound,</hi> as their Navigation is
cheaper, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cuſtoms are more: So that if the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> be double dearer, when Ships of like
Dimenſions be full fraight, then if a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship be full fraight, and
an <hi>Engliſh</hi> but half fraight, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> becomes fourfold dearer;
and this became ſo much more to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by how much the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Fraights were leſs after the <hi>Sileſians</hi> and <hi>Polanders</hi> had
got the Art of making <hi>Sleſys;</hi> from thence it followed, that
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (by reaſon of the Dearneſs of their Navigation)
could not ſell their Cloths ſo cheap, but the <hi>Dutch</hi> became
Competitors with them, having learnt the Art of making Cloths
from thoſe which fled into <hi>Holland</hi> to avoid <hi>Laud</hi>'s and <hi>Wren</hi>'s
Perſecutions, in not complying with their Eccleſiaſtical Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     <p>This Year 1648, at the Treaty of <hi>Munſter,</hi> a Peace was made
between the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>States of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi>
wherein they were declared <hi>free States,</hi> and ſo had as
free a Trade with <hi>Spain</hi> as the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> ſo that tho the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
upon the matter had had the ſole Trade to <hi>Spain,</hi> excluſive to the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> for near forty five Years, now the <hi>Dutch</hi> were Competitors
in it with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as well as that into the <hi>Sound,</hi> with Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Manufactures.</p>

                  <p>FAith, Truth, and Piety, are rarely found in Men who
follow Camps. The Army, who in their Remonſtrance
would have the Parliament diſſolved, and another called

<hi>Rump</hi> to be their Head, whereby they may ſhare the Church,
Crown-Lands, and Delinquents Eſtates among themſelves, regard
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:60932:175"/>
neither Parliament nor Nation; and ſure never was there ſuch a
Generation, who ſo impudently out-braved Truth, and all that
may be call'd Sacred. If you could force a Belief into them, they
firſt told you they fought for King and Parliament; then they
declared for the King and People againſt the Parliament; and
now they have taken off the King, if you will have any Benefit
of their Protection, you muſt engage to their Government, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
King or Houſe of Lords, and be content with a piece of the
Commons, call'd the <hi>Rump.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not content with the Death of the King, the <hi>Rump</hi> proceeds
to aboliſh Monarchy, and place the original Power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the People, whoſe Repreſentatives they are, if you'll take
their Word; and voted it High Treaſon to reſtore Monarchy, or
to aſſiſt, or pray for <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> or any of that Line; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the King's Statue, with an <hi>Exit tyrannus Regum ultimus,</hi>
Nor are they ſatiated with the Blood of the King, but erect ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
High Court of Injuſtice, whereof one <hi>Liſle,</hi> an ignorant Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
was Preſident; who condemns the Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Earl
of <hi>Holland,</hi> and Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> for raiſing Arms againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which themſelves had deſtroy'd.</p>
                  <p>But tho the <hi>Rump</hi> and Army were eſtabliſh'd upon theſe ſtrange
Principles, yet being the Inſtruments of Divine Vengeance, like a
Torrent broke looſe from raging Seas, in leſs than five Years time
they overwhelm not only <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
pull'd the <hi>Dutch States</hi> up by the Roots, and made <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Spain</hi> tremble. But that we may obſerve what follow'd, let's
ſee what went before.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> were the firſt who invaded <hi>England</hi> againſt the King,
to impoſe their Solemn League and Covenant, which was more
againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws and Conſtitutions than <hi>Laud</hi>'s Service-Books,
Canons, and High-Commiſſion, were againſt the <hi>Scotiſh.</hi>
In <hi>July</hi> laſt the <hi>Scots</hi> invaded <hi>England,</hi> commanded by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<hi>Hamilton;</hi> in <hi>August, Cromwel</hi> routs, and utterly overthrows
this Army, and takes <hi>Hamilton</hi> Priſoner: So the <hi>Scots</hi> who began
theſe Wars firſt, are the firſt chaſtiſed by this <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army. But
this is but the Earneſt of what ſhall follow.</p>
                  <p>The ſecluded Members who firſt join'd the <hi>Scots,</hi> beginning
firſt with an equivocal Proteſtation, but after downright joined
with the <hi>Scots</hi> in their Covenant, are now not only turned out of
the Houſe by the <hi>Rump,</hi> but kept in naſty Priſons, till they became
as little dangerous as <hi>The Houſe of Lords.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The horrid <hi>Iriſh</hi> Maſſacre and Rebellion ſucceeded in the third
place: And now the <hi>Rump,</hi> having eſtabliſhed themſelves by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
of the <hi>Scots</hi> under <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and depoſing the ſecluded
Members, are laying Rods in Piſs to ſcourge theſe abominable
<hi>Iriſh.</hi> But before we proceed, let's ſee how things ſtood in
<hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:60932:175"/>
In <hi>October</hi> 1641. the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Maſſacre was, which ſucceeded in a
Rebellion, in which <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s Scarlet was as deep dyed, as in the
<hi>Scotiſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commotions. The Head of this accurſed Crew
was <hi>John Baptiſta Pennuncio,</hi> the Pope's Nuncio, who in his Paſſage
through <hi>France</hi> threatned he would ſuffer no Man to live in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
that wiſhed well to the King, or to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Affairs. Thus
you ſee how all the Factions conſpired againſt the King, the Laws
and Conſtitutions of <hi>England:</hi> But for theſe laſt ſeven Years,
<hi>viz.</hi> ſo long as the Diſtractions were continued in <hi>England,</hi> the
War was purſued but by halves in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>King <hi>Charles,</hi> in his Life-time, had made the Marqueſs of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who in 1643 made a Truce with the
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> that the King might make uſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>England:</hi>
But the <hi>Iriſh</hi> kept their Faith no better in it, than the <hi>Scots</hi> had
before with the King in the Peace in 1639. For on a ſudden
they riſe againſt the Marqueſs (now the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are ſent into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi>
and had ſurprized him, if he had not been informed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and eſcaped into <hi>Dublin:</hi> and being in no Condition to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it, but obliged to deliver it up either to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſent by
the Parliament, or to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> he gave it up to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who
make Colonel <hi>Jones</hi> Governour; and ſo <hi>Ormond</hi> leaves <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Marqueſs was withdrawn, the Nuncio behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
(like a Church-Man) with ſuch a Deſpotical Tyranny, that
he became intolerable, even to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> themſelves; who, being
preſs'd by <hi>Jones, Coot,</hi> and <hi>Monk,</hi> combine in a Body, and ſend
to the Queen and to the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> (for then the King was
cloſe Priſoner in the Iſle of <hi>Wight)</hi> to return the Marqueſs of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
and they would ſubmit to his Authority, and join to expel
the <hi>Scots</hi> and Parliament's Forces. The Nuncio taking this for an
Affront to his Authority (being that of the Apoſtolick See,
which is infallible) threatens Excommunication to them who
ſhould not obey him; but neither he, nor his Excommunication,
were obey'd, but was forced to Capitulate with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to procure his Departure, which was as ſhameful, as his
Entrance was proud and inſolent.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Marqueſs's Return, he enter'd into moſt diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Articles with the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> which yet would not pleaſe <hi>Owen Ro
Oneal,</hi> who join'd with the Parliament's Forces, and reliev'd
<hi>Londonderry,</hi> then beſieg'd by the Lord <hi>Ardes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this Pacification with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> ſuch as it was, <hi>Ormond</hi>
raiſes a numerous Army, and by my Lord <hi>Inchiqueen,</hi> routs a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Jones</hi>'s going to <hi>Drogheda,</hi> who takes the Town, and <hi>Dundalk,
Green-Caſtle, Newry,</hi> and <hi>Trim,</hi> and returns Victorious to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs.
Hereupon the Marqueſs beſieges <hi>Dublin,</hi> but unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſends my Lord <hi>Inchiqueen</hi> into <hi>Munſter,</hi> with, if not the greateſt,
the beſt part of the Army; <hi>Jones</hi> falls upon the Remainder, and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:60932:176"/>
utterly routs them: This was in <hi>August</hi> 1649. And the ſame
Month <hi>Cromwel</hi> lands at <hi>Dublin</hi> with an Army of 15000 old Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Diſaſter, the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> no more to be reconciled to the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> than the <hi>Scots</hi> Covenanters to Epiſcopacy, quarrel with
the Marqueſs; which was never after compoſed: So the Marqueſs
left <hi>Ireland</hi> again, leaving the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> Deputy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cromwel,</hi> after his landing, firſt ſtorms <hi>Drogheda,</hi> or <hi>Tredah,</hi>
with a moſt terrible Execution; and after, in leſs than one Year,
all <hi>Ireland,</hi> upon the matter, is reduced to the Obedience of the
<hi>Rump;</hi> who take dreadful Vengeance upon all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> who could
be found to have had any hand in the Maſſacre of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King, <hi>Charles</hi> II. having loſt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with all
their Dependencies, except the Iſles of <hi>Guernſey, Jerſey, Man,</hi> and
<hi>Scilly,</hi> and the Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> which ſhall ſoon follow,
ſet up for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and makes the Marqueſs of <hi>Montroſs</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner;
who having got together about 400 <hi>Swedes, Danes,
Poles,</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> lands them at the <hi>Wick</hi> of <hi>Cathneſs</hi> in <hi>April
1650,</hi> and takes <hi>Dumbeath:</hi> But <hi>Leſley</hi> having ſent Major-General
<hi>Straughan,</hi> with 300 choice Horſe, he ſet upon this ill compoſed
Body of <hi>Montroſs,</hi> and utterly routs them: <hi>Montroſs</hi> fled, but was
betrayed by the Laird of <hi>Aſton,</hi> who had formerly ſerved him.</p>
                  <p>The Covenanters, to ſhew their Clemency and Humility, bind
the Marqueſs in a Chair planted backwards on a Cart, that all
Men might ſee him, the Hangman, with his Hat on, riding before;
and upon the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1650, by a Sentence pronounced the
Day before by the Lord <hi>Lowden,</hi> was hanged upon a Gibbet 30
Foot high, at the Croſs of <hi>Edinburg,</hi> for three Hours: after which,
he was quarter'd, and his Head ſet upon the <hi>Talbooth,</hi> and his
Legs and Arms over the Gates of <hi>Sterlin, Glaſgow, Dundee,</hi> and
<hi>Aberdeen.</hi> But ſee the Piety and Commiſeration of theſe humble
People! They order, in the Sentence, that if he repented, ſo that
his Excommunication ſhould be taken off, the Trunk of his Body
ſhould be buried in the <hi>Grey-Friars;</hi> otherwiſe, in the <hi>Burrough-Moor,</hi>
the Common Burial of Malefactors. But Vengeance ſhall
ſoon overtake theſe cruel Proceedings.</p>
                  <p>For the Kirk, ſore afflicted for their depoſed Brethren in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
now in naſty Priſons, whereby Hereſy, Schiſm, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs
raged, and the Throne of Presbytery was defaced, but
being unable of themſelves to reſtore their Brethren, before <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſs</hi>'s
Death, had agreed to have the King proclaimed King of
<hi>Scotland, England, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> yet ſo as to take the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
League and Covenant, to give Signs of Sorrow and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for his Father and Mother's Sins, and baniſh and turn out
of his Court all who had not taken the Covenant, or taken up
Arms for his Father. But the Kirk could not have found a Plant
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:60932:176"/>
ſo unlikely to produce the Fruit of Repentance, or to eſtabliſh the
Throne of Presbytery, as this King. However, they'll try what's
to be done; and to this end, ſend Commiſſioners to treat with
the King at <hi>Jerſey,</hi> not yet reduced by the <hi>Rump:</hi> and a Treaty
is agreed to, to be at <hi>Breda</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King was perplex'd what to do; for to be a King in Fact,
he deſired above all things: but to forſake his Mother and Father's
Friends, was grievous to him; and to come to the Stool of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
was full ſore againſt his Will. Yet to be a King, as a Man
does for a Wife, he forſakes Father, Mother, and his dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Friends, and comes to <hi>Breda:</hi> There the News comes of
<hi>Montroſs</hi>'s tragical Defeat and Execution, which had like to have
ſpoil'd all; but over Shooes, over Boots; on he goes, having ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to all the rigid Terms the Kirk-men impoſed upon him.
And in <hi>June</hi> 1650, arrives in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be anew inſtructed in
the Diſcipline of the Kirk.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Rump</hi> in the mean while were not idle, you muſt think;
for having ſpued up Presbytery in <hi>England,</hi> they ſcorn'd to chew
the Cud of it from <hi>Scotland:</hi> and therefore <hi>Fairfax</hi> having refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to command an Army againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> they ſend for <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by this time is good as reduced by him, and
declared him General of all the Forces of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and
<hi>Ireland;</hi> who, about the latter end of <hi>June</hi> 1650, enters <hi>Scotland,</hi>
with a well-diſciplin'd rather than a numerous Army: and having
taken many Places of ſmall moment, and often beat the <hi>Scots</hi> in
Skirmiſhes, upon the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>September</hi> utterly overthrows the much
more numerous Kirk-Army at <hi>Dumbar,</hi> commanded by their old
General <hi>Leſley, 3000 Scots</hi> killed, 9000 taken Priſoners, all their
Baggage and Ammunition, and above 200 Colours, which, as Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies,
were hung up in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Scots</hi> had before taken ſuch Pains and Care to unite both Nations
in their Solemn League and Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe things were doing, the Kirk at <hi>Edinburg</hi> were
cloſe at their Devotion, hourly expecting the Feet of thoſe which
ſhould bring the glad Tidings which were at hand; when <hi>Leſley,</hi>
the ſame Day, brings Tidings of their utter Overthrow. Now was
all their Joy turned to Lamentation and Wo, and the Songs of
<hi>Sion</hi> are like to be ſung in a ſtrange Land.</p>
                  <p>To augment theſe Miſeries, the King, who could not ſubmit
to the rigid Diſcipline of the Kirk, runs from <hi>Schole</hi> to the Houſe
of the Lord <hi>Dippon,</hi> intending for the <hi>Highlands,</hi> where he might
go to School with more Liberty. Now all is in a Hurlyburley.
After the King runs <hi>Montgomery</hi> from the Kirk, promiſing the
King, if he would return, the Kirk would remit part of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline:
upon which, the King returned to <hi>St. Johnſtons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:60932:177"/>
The King thus returned, did not pleaſe the Kirk-men, for being
beaten by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they rail againſt thoſe that called the King
in too haſtily, before he had given Marks of his Repentance and
Converſion to God; and that it was not lawful for any who were
truly Godly to take up Arms for him; and for the Advancement of
the Kirk, made <hi>Kerr</hi> and <hi>Straughan</hi> Generals of the Kirk-Forces.
But <hi>Straughan</hi> runs to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and <hi>Kerr</hi> is utterly defeated, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and taken by <hi>Lambert.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe things were thus doing in <hi>Scotland,</hi> let's ſee what
was doing in <hi>England:</hi> In <hi>January</hi> this Year the <hi>Rump</hi> erected a
High Court of Juſtice, whereof one <hi>Keeble,</hi> an ignorant Petty-fogging
Lawyer, was Preſident in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> upon pretence of an
intended Inſurrection for bringing in of the King, where 24 were
condemned, and 20 executed, whereof one Mr. <hi>Hobbard,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or near Kinſman to Sir <hi>John Hobbard,</hi> who after married
<hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Niece, and Widow of Col. <hi>Hammond,</hi> was one. And
in <hi>March</hi> following the <hi>Rump</hi> erected another High Court of Juſtice,
which condemned Sir <hi>Henry Hide</hi> for taking the King's Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be his Ambaſſador at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Kirk-Party now loſe their Reputation; they had nothing
left, but to preach and pray, and rail: and now the Parliament
and General Aſſembly take in all who will take the Covenant, but
all to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Cromwel</hi> having taken <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Town and Caſtle, <hi>Jedworth,
Reſlan</hi> and <hi>Tantallon</hi> Caſtle, ſends <hi>Overton</hi> and <hi>Lambert,</hi> in Boats
over the <hi>Frith,</hi> who rout Sir <hi>John Brown,</hi> and Major General <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi>
kill 2000 of their Men, and take 1200 Priſoners, and
<hi>Brown</hi> himſelf, with 42 Colours.</p>
                  <p>Now, though <hi>Scotland</hi> were a cold Climate, 'twas too hot to
hold the King and his Army, and therefore with them he ſlips
into <hi>England,</hi> by the Way of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> leaving the Kirk in Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and Woes, that Hereſy and Schiſm had overſpread the
Beauty of Holineſs, now Profaneneſs and Superſtition had left it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Harriſon</hi> and <hi>Lambert</hi> followed the King, and <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſoon after,
who at <hi>Worceſter</hi> (that Day Twelve Month after he had routed
the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Dunbar)</hi> utterly again routs the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> kills
3550, with Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> and General <hi>Forbes,</hi> and takes 5000
Priſoners, with the Earls of <hi>Rothes, Kanwarth, Kelly,</hi> the Lord
<hi>Sinclare</hi> and <hi>Montgomery,</hi> General of the Ordnance; and ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>David Leſley</hi> (who fought not, or but little in the Battel) is
routed by <hi>Lilburn,</hi> and taken Priſoner, with <hi>Lauderdale</hi> (who held
Correſpondence in <hi>England</hi> with the Covenanting <hi>Scots)</hi> and the
Lords <hi>Kenmore</hi> and <hi>Middleton:</hi> Yet the King by a Miracle eſcaped,
to be reſtored King <hi>Charles</hi> II.</p>
                  <p>But the ſame Fate did not attend the Noble Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> who

Maj. General <hi>Milton,</hi> and Col. <hi>Mackworth</hi> Preſident, at
<hi>Cheſter;</hi> and upon the <hi>22d</hi> was beheaded.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Cromwel</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> he left <hi>Monk</hi> to command in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> who beſieges and takes <hi>Sterlin</hi>-Caſtle by Surrender, with
all the Guns, Ammunition and Arms, Money, Jewels, and the
Regiſters transferred from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> thither, and quite defaced
the lofty Inſcription:
<q>
                        <l>—Nobis haec invicta dedere</l>
                        <l>Centum ſex Proavi—</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>About this time old General <hi>Leſley</hi> was raiſing an Army in <hi>Perth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.
Monk</hi> ſends <hi>Morgan</hi> and <hi>Alured</hi> to prevent it; who ſurprized
them, and take <hi>Leſley,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Crawford</hi> and <hi>Lindſey,</hi> the
Lord <hi>Ogilby,</hi> and many other Priſoners: and after take <hi>Dunfriſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this time <hi>Monk</hi> beſieges and takes <hi>Dundee</hi> by Storm with as
terrible an Execution, as <hi>Cromwel</hi> the Year before had done at
<hi>Tredah:</hi> Here it was, and at <hi>Sterlin</hi>-Caſtle, the <hi>Scots</hi> had lodged
all their Plunder and Money they had got in <hi>England,</hi> which was
ſo plentiful, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> common Souldiers ſhared Money
by Hatfuls. The Terror of this Succeſs frighted <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and all
the other Towns in <hi>Scotland</hi> into Obedience; nor did it ſtay here,
but all the Iſles of <hi>Orcades</hi> and <hi>Shetland</hi> ſubmitted; which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Roman</hi> nor <hi>Engliſh</hi> Force could ever accompliſh.</p>
                  <p>Now the Kirk-Party are all in Yelling and Woes, Hereſy and
Schiſm had overſpread the beauteous Diſcipline of Reformation:
Now they cannot perſecute other Men, they exclaim and cry out
they are perſecuted themſelves: Their Nobles (except <hi>Argile)</hi>
which are not killed, are committed to Priſon, that they might
ſhare in the Tribulations, as well as Triumphs of their Brethren
in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Tribulations of the <hi>Covenanting Party</hi> did not end in
Impriſonment only, but extended to Life; for upon the <hi>22d</hi> of
<hi>Auguſt, Love</hi> and <hi>Gibbons</hi> (two moſt zealous <hi>Covenanters)</hi> were
executed by a Judgment of a High Court of Juſtice (as 'twas
called) for holding Intelligence with their Brethren in <hi>Scotland;</hi>
ſo that this High-Juſtice, or <hi>Summum Jus,</hi> reached the <hi>Covenanters</hi>
as well as the <hi>Royaliſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="348" facs="tcp:60932:178"/>
Now the <hi>Rump</hi> change the Fabrick of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Government,
and make Itinerant Judges, part <hi>Scots,</hi> part <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and make a
Council of State of that medly; yet allow them 30 Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to ſit and vote in their Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> ſo that tho
the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> were independent upon the Crown of
<hi>England,</hi> yet <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well as <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the <hi>Rump:</hi> And that the <hi>Scots</hi> may be the more tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ridden, they are denied Arms, and even Horſes, unleſs on
neceſſary Occaſions.</p>
                  <p>The Victory at <hi>Worceſter</hi> ſwelled the Sails of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
brim full, ſo that he began to entertain Thoughts of Setting
up himſelf; yet being a tickliſh Point, wherein he was ſure to be
oppoſed by the Factions as well as Royaliſts, upon the <hi>10th</hi> of
<hi>December,</hi> he called a Meeting of divers Members of the Houſe,
and ſome of the Principal Officers of the Army, and propoſed to
them, <hi>That now the old King being dead, and his Son defeated, he
held it neceſſary to come to a Settlement of the Nation; and that he
requeſted this Meeting, that they might conſider and adviſe what was
fit to be done, and to preſent it to the Parliament:</hi> So much eaſier
is it to deſtroy a Government, than to erect another. And now
<hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Adherents had overturned the Government of
Three Kingdoms, they are to adviſe and conſider how to erect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
This was the good Fight which theſe Men fought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy,
and then knew not what to do. However we'll give the
Account of theſe Mens Opinions <hi>verbatim,</hi> as I find it in <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi>'s
<hi>Memoirs, f. 492. a. b.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lenthal.</hi> My Lord <hi>(who made him ſo?)</hi> This Company were very
ready to attend your Excellency, and the Buſineſs you were pleaſed to
propound to us is very neceſſary to be conſidered: God hath given mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
Succeſs to our Forces under your Command, and if we do not
improve theſe Mercies <hi>(Blood, Rapine and Murder)</hi> to ſome Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſuch as may be to God's Honour and the Good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
we ſhall be very much blame-worthy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Harriſon.</hi> I think that which my Lord General hath propounded as
to a Settlement both of our Civil and Spiritual Liberties, and ſo that
the Mercies which the Lord hath given in to us, may not be caſt away;
how this may be done is the great Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whitlock.</hi> It is a great Queſtion indeed, and not ſuddenly to be
reſolved; yet it were pity that a Meeting of ſo many able and worthy
Perſons, as I ſee here, ſhould be fruitleſs; and I would humbly offer in
the firſt Place, whether it be not requiſite to be underſtood in what way
this Settlement is deſired, whether by an Abſolute Republick, or with
any Mixture of Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cromwel.</hi> My Lord Commiſſioner <hi>Whitlock</hi> hath put us upon the
right Point, and indeed it is my meaning, that we ſhould conſider
whether a Republick, or a mixt Monarchical Government, will be beſt
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:60932:178"/>
ſettled; and if any thing Monarchical, then in whom that Power ſhall
be placed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir Tho. Widdrington.</hi> I think a mix'd Monarchical Government
will be moſt ſutable to the Laws and People of this Nation; and if
any Monarchical, I ſuppoſe we ſhall hold it moſt juſt to place that Power
in one of the Sons of the late King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fleetwood.</hi> I think that Queſtion, whether an abſolute Republick,
or a mix'd Monarchy be beſt to be ſettled in this Nation, will not very
eaſily be determined.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>L. C. J. St. John.</hi> It will be found that the Government of this
Nation, without ſomething of Monarchical Power, will be very difficult
to be ſo ſettled, as not to ſhake the Foundation of our Laws, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the People.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lenthal.</hi> It will breed a ſtrange Confuſion, to ſettle a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Nation without ſomething of Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Desborough.</hi> I beſeech you, my Lord, why may not this as well as
other Nations be governed by a Republick?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whitlock.</hi> The Laws of <hi>England</hi> are ſo interwoven with the
Power and Practice of Monarchy, that to ſettle a Government with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſomething of Monarchy in it, would breed ſo great an Alteration
in the Proceedings of our Law, that you will ſcarce find time to rectify;
nor can we well foreſee the Inconveniencies which will ariſe thereby.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whaley.</hi> I do not underſtand Matters of Law, but it ſeems to me
the beſt way, not to have any thing of Monarchical Power in the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Government; and if we ſhould reſolve upon any, whom
ſhould we pitch upon? The King's eldeſt Son hath been in Arms againſt
us, and his ſecond Son is our Enemy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Widdrington.</hi> But the late King's third Son, the <hi>Duke of
Gloceſter,</hi> is ſtill among us, and too young to have been in Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, or infected with the Principles of our Enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whitlock.</hi> There may be a day given for the King's eldeſt Son,
or for the Duke of <hi>York</hi> his Brother, to come in to the Parliament,
and upon ſuch Terms as ſhall be thought fit and agreeable, both to our
Civil and Spiritual Liberties, and a Settlement may be made upon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cromwel.</hi> This will be a Buſineſs of more than ordinary Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but really <hi>(a Word much uſed by him)</hi> I think, if it may be
done with Safety, and Preſervation of our Rights, both as <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and as Chriſtians, that a Settlement of ſomewhat of Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Power would be very effectual.</p>
                  <p>So that the Soldiers were for a Republick, except <hi>Fleetwood,</hi>
who knew not what to ſay; the Lawyers for a mix'd Monarchy,
and many for the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> to be King; but then <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
(deſigning for himſelf) ſtill put off the Debate to ſome other
Point; ſo the Company part without any Reſult at all: yet
<hi>Cromwel</hi> diſcovered by this Meeting the Inclinations of the Perſons
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:60932:179"/>
which ſpake, for which he fiſhed, and made uſe of what he thus
diſcerned. But this Point was too tender to be further preſſed at this
time, and ſo we leave it, till <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſhall give a further Occaſion.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>October,</hi> this Year, <hi>Haines</hi> reduced <hi>Jerſey</hi> to the <hi>Rump;</hi> and
in <hi>January</hi> the Iſle of <hi>Barbadoes</hi> was ſurrender'd to <hi>Askew,</hi> ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the <hi>Rump;</hi> and in this Month, an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man of War
meeting with ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> Fiſhermen, demanded the tenth Herring,
as a Duty for their Fiſhing in theſe Seas; which the <hi>Dutch</hi> denying,
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſunk one of their Ships, and all the Men were loſt,
(ſee <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s <hi>Memoirs,</hi> fol. 487. <hi>b.)</hi> and here began the firſt Quarrel
between the <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>Dutch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Rump</hi> thus every where Victorious at home, yet it may be
fearing they had diſguſted all Chriſtian Princes by the Death of the
King, (and already the <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> had revoked all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
of Trade which had been granted to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the Reigns
of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> and Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and continued in the Reigns of King
<hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles,</hi> and baniſhed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
for putting the King to Death) upon the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> ſent
the Chief Juſtice <hi>St. John</hi> and Mr. <hi>Strickland</hi> to treat of a Coaliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> whoſe Title and Government were the ſame,
or not unlike to the <hi>Rump</hi>'s; and if this could be obtained, both
Republicks being incomparably ſuperiour to all the Kings in the
World by Sea, they need not fear any Enemies abroad.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Dutch</hi> fearing this Coalition with <hi>England,</hi> (where the
Harbours for Shipping are more, and much better than thoſe in
<hi>Holland)</hi> would rob them of the Trades they were poſſeſſed of,
and that their rich Merchants, in caſe of a Coalition, would be
tempted to lay out their Monies upon real Securities in <hi>England,</hi>
rather than to venture them in the contingent Accidents of Trade,
not only refuſed to enter into a Coalition, but rudely treated
<hi>St. John;</hi> whoſe haughty Spirit ill brooking ſuch Affronts, made
a Report of his Embaſſy, little to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Advantage.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the <hi>Rump</hi> made the Act of Navigation, deſigning
thereby to have, in a great meaſure, leſſened the <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade, and
encreaſed the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> tho both ſucceeded quite contrary, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
we ſhall make it appear: Yet the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by virtue of this
Law, took Occaſion to ſearch the <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſels, and often to make
Prize of them; whereupon the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſent over four Ambaſſadors,
<hi>Catz, Van de Peere, Sharp,</hi> and <hi>Newport,</hi> to pacify the <hi>Rump,</hi>
which they were ſo far from effecting, that the <hi>Rump,</hi> upon their
firſt Audience, upon the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> demand the Arrears for
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fiſhing upon the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> that
the Survivors of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> aſſiſting in the Maſſacre of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> ſhould be given up to Juſtice; and a free Trade up
the <hi>Scheld.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="351" facs="tcp:60932:179"/>
The <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors were ſurprized at theſe Demands, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no Inſtructions thereupon; or if they had, could not have
given any reaſonable Anſwer againſt them: Yet ſtill they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to make great Proteſtations of their Love and Affection to
the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> and their moſt ardent Deſire of
propagating and encreaſing the true Reformed Religion; yet pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
gave the State an Account how little was to be expected
from the <hi>Rump</hi> by a Treaty. Hereupon the <hi>Dutch</hi> prepare for a
War, nor was the <hi>Rump</hi> herein behind hand with them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>May</hi> ſet out a Fleet of Men of War, commanded
by <hi>Van Trump,</hi> pretending for the Security of Trade, but with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
not to ſtrike Sail to the <hi>Engliſh Flag;</hi> and upon the <hi>17th</hi>
of <hi>May</hi> came into <hi>Dover</hi> Road with 45 Sail of Men of War, where
<hi>Trump</hi> rode at Anchor, as if he defied what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could do
to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Blake,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral, had but 15 Men of War, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to have an Account of <hi>Trump</hi> what he had to do in <hi>Dover</hi>
Road, and ſailed directly to him: hereupon <hi>Trump</hi> ſtood to the
Eaſt-ward, and by that means being become Head-moſt of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, bore directly upon them; and being come within
Muſquet-ſhot of the <hi>Engliſh, Blake</hi> gave Order to fire at <hi>Trump</hi>'s Flag,
which was done thrice, but inſtead of ſtriking it, <hi>Trump</hi> poured
in a Broad-ſide upon <hi>Blake,</hi> and Major <hi>Bourn</hi> at this time coming
to <hi>Blake</hi>'s Aſſiſtance with 8 Men of War, both Fleets engaged
from four in the Afternoon till Night, wherein there were not leſs
than 2000 Shot exchanged upon one and the other ſide; and the
<hi>Dutch</hi> had one Man of War taken and another ſunk, and 150 Men
ſlain; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had not one Ship loſt or diſabled, and very few
Men killed: This Fight was the <hi>19th</hi> of <hi>May. Van Trump</hi> in the
Night drew his Ships on the Back of the <hi>Goodwin</hi> Sands, and next
Morning ſailed back to <hi>Zealand,</hi> inſtead of ſecuring the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Trade.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the <hi>Rump</hi> ſet a Guard upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors at
<hi>Chelſey;</hi> but tho the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet in this Fight received little
Damage, yet that of the <hi>Dutch</hi> was ſo batter'd, as made it unfit to
fight. About this time <hi>Virginia</hi> ſubmitted to the <hi>Rump,</hi> but not
<hi>New-England,</hi> nor ever after did that I can find.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> thus balk'd in their Expectation of great things to
be done by <hi>Van Trump,</hi> and finding the contrary Succeſs, ſent a
Paper to their Ambaſſadors in <hi>England,</hi> which was preſented to
the Council of State the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> therein <hi>taking God the
Searcher of all Hearts to witneſs, that the moſt unhappy Fight of
the Ships of both Commonwealths, did happen againſt the Knowledg
and Will of the Lords States-General of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited</hi> Netherlands,
<hi>and that with Grief and Aſtoniſhment they received the fatal News of
that unhappy raſh Action.</hi> A likely matter, as if <hi>Van Trump</hi> ſhould
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:60932:180"/>
dare to do ſuch an Action without their Order, and they not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
him for it.</p>
                  <p>That they did conſult and endeavour to find out what Remedy chiefly
may be applied to mitigate that raw and bloody Wound, and to that
end had written to gather a ſolemn Meeting of Parliament or all the
Provinces, whereby they doubt not but a Help may be found out for
theſe Troubles, and a better hope of our Treaty in hand for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good of both Nations, to ſhun the deteſtable ſhedding of Chriſtian
Blood (ſo much deſired, and would be dearly bought by the common
Enemies of both Nations.) We again crave this moſt Honourable
Council, and beſeech you by the Pledges both of common Religion and
Liberty <hi>(Terms unuſual in the High and Mighty States, and never
uſed by them to any King ſince the Reign of Queen</hi> Elizabeth)
mean while to ſuffer nothing to be done out of too much Heat, that
afterwards may prove neither revocable nor repairable, but too late
Vows and Wiſhes; but rather that you would let us receive a kind
Anſwer without further Delay, upon our laſt Requeſt.</p>

Dutch <hi>Hypocriſy, the</hi> Rump <hi>gave this Anſwer:</hi> That calling to mind
with what continued Demonſtrations of Friendſhip and Affection, from
the beginning of their Inteſtine Troubles, they have proceeded with the
Neighbours of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> they do find themſelves much
ſurprized with the unſutable returns they have made thereunto, and
eſpecially at the Acts of Hoſtility lately committed in the very Roads
of <hi>England</hi> upon the Fleet of this Commonwealth, the matter of Fact
whereof ſtated in clear Proofs, is hereto annexed: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of all, and of the ſeveral Papers delivered by your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
to the Council of State, the Parliament thinks fit to give
this Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>As they are willing to make a charitable Conſtruction of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
uſed in theſe Papers, endeavouring to repreſent the late En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
of the Fleets without their Knowledg, and againſt the
Minds of their Superiours; ſo when they conſider how diſagreeable to
that Profeſſion, the Reſolution and Actions of your State, and of their
Miniſters at Sea, have been, even in the midſt of a Treaty offered by
themſelves, and managed by your Excellencies, by the extraordinary
Preparations of 150 Sail of Men of War, without any viſible occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
but what does now appear a juſt ground of Jealouſy in your
own Judgments, when your Lordſhips pretended to excuſe it, and the
Inſtructions themſelves given by your Superiours to their Commanders
at Sea, they do find too much cauſe to believe that the <hi>Lords States of
the United Provinces</hi> have an Intention by Force to uſurp the known
Rights of <hi>England</hi> in the Seas, to deſtroy the Fleets, that are under
God, their Walls and Bulwarks, and thereby to expoſe this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
to Invaſion, as by this late Action they attempted to do.</p>

Whereupon the Parliament conceive they are obliged to endeavour,
with God's Aſſiſtance, as they have opportunity, to ſeek Reparation of
the Wrong already ſuffered, and Security that the like be not attempted
for the future.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, with this Mind and Deſire, that all Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

                  <p>Hereupon the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors the next day, <hi>viz. June</hi> the
<hi>30th,</hi> demanded Audience of Leave to depart, which was granted;
but the <hi>Rump</hi> would not recede from <hi>demanding Satisfaction for all
their Damages.</hi> Hereupon the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors returned home.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> foreſeeing a Coalition with <hi>England,</hi> or a War would

                  <p>Now both <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>States</hi> make all imaginable Preparations for
War; and about the beginning of <hi>July, Blake</hi> with a gallant Fleet
went Northwards, and left Sir <hi>George Askue</hi> to command the reſt of
the Fleet in the <hi>Downs,</hi> who took five <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant Men, and
<hi>Blake</hi> in his Paſſage took two Men of War, and two Merchant-Men;
and within a day or two after, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi>
Sir <hi>George</hi> met 40 <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, took 7 of them, burnt 4, and ran
24 on Ground upon the <hi>French</hi> Shore, where, tho the <hi>French</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
them againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> yet coming aboard the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Ships, they plunder'd them.</p>

                     <pb n="354" facs="tcp:60932:181"/>
Upon the <hi>24th, Blake</hi> took 100 of the <hi>Dutch</hi> fiſhing Buſſes,
and in them 1500 Priſoners: and about the laſt of <hi>July Blake</hi> fell
upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> Convoy for their Fiſhery in the Northern Seas,
conſiſting of 12 Men of War, and ſunk three, and took the other
nine, with all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Buſſes, and unloaded all their Fiſh, and
ſent the Fiſhermen home; and <hi>Blake</hi> alſo took three of the <hi>Dutch
Eaſt-India</hi>-Men richly laden. In theſe Actions <hi>Blake</hi> had but 8
Men of War, and <hi>Blake</hi> ſent ſix of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War to
Major General <hi>Dean</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

                  <p>Upon the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> Sir <hi>George Askue</hi> with 38 Sail of Men
of War ſet upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet of 55 Sail, and 15 Merchant-Men
near <hi>Plimouth;</hi> the Fight laſted three days, and the <hi>Dutch</hi>
loſt two Ships, one ſunk, the other burnt, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> none. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the <hi>Dutch</hi> retired to the Coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> and Sir <hi>George</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
them, and charged them, and ſunk the <hi>Dutch</hi> Admiral, and
loſt but one Fire-ſhip, who having taken out her Men, ſent her
among the <hi>Dutch;</hi> but being upon the <hi>French</hi> Coaſt, Sir <hi>George</hi>
purſued the <hi>Dutch</hi> no further, and went Northward to repair his
Fleet.</p>
                  <p>At this time there was no Peace between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi>
and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having beſieged <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> ſet out a
Fleet under the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> to relieve it: This Fleet was
ſet upon by <hi>Blake</hi> in the <hi>Downs,</hi> who had then but 7 Men of
War with him, whereof the <hi>Soveraign</hi> was one; and upon the <hi>6th</hi>
of <hi>September, Blake</hi> engaged the whole <hi>French</hi> Fleet, and took 7
of their Men of War, and diſperſed the reſt; whereupon <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi>

                     <hi>Van Trump</hi> upon his Misfortune having laid down his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
his Command was given to <hi>De Wit;</hi> and the King of

ſeized all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships and their Effects within the <hi>Sound</hi>
or <hi>Zundt,</hi> and joined five of his Men of War with the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Succeſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet in theſe Seas was not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered

thoſe Seas, about the latter end of <hi>September,</hi> with 16 <hi>Dutch</hi> Men of
War, in which Encounter the <hi>Phoenix</hi> (formerly miſtaken for the

under the Protection of the Port of <hi>Leghorn:</hi> but <hi>Van Galen</hi> bought
this Victory with the loſs of his Life; and upon the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>
following, Captain <hi>Cox</hi> with two Boats of brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> in
the Port of <hi>Leghorn,</hi> boarded her and brought her off, and young

being taken Priſoner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>De Wit</hi> had ſmall Joy of his Employment, having <hi>De Ruiter</hi>
joined in Commiſſion with him; for having fitted out ſo great a

Fleet as the <hi>Dutch</hi> could put out, they took their Station in <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
on the ſide of the <hi>North-Foreland</hi> upon the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Coaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Blake</hi> having been on the Weſtern Coaſt, and having taken five
<hi>Dutch Weſt-India</hi> Ships, and ſix <hi>Straits</hi> Ships, valued at 200000 <hi>l.</hi>
haſtned with his Fleet towards the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and divided it into
three Squadrons, one commanded by himſelf, another by Vice-Admiral
<hi>Penn,</hi> and the third by Rear-Admiral <hi>Bourn;</hi> and upon
the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> engaged the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, and boarded and
took their Rear-Admiral, and ſunk two more of them, and one
was blown up; and the reſt of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet was ſo ſhatter'd
that it was forced to fly, and was purſued by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> twelve
Leagues: the <hi>Engliſh</hi> loſt not one Ship, tho many of them were
diſabled in their Rigging.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Van Trump</hi> thus laid aſide, the ill Succeſs of <hi>De Wit</hi> and <hi>Ruiter</hi>
put the <hi>States</hi> to their Trumps what to do; when the King of

out another Fleet, and having got 80 Sail of Men of War, and
10 Fire-ſhips, ſailed directly to the <hi>Downs,</hi> where <hi>Blake</hi> lay with
about 40; and upon the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> a furious Fight was
between them, which laſted from two in the Morning till ſix at
Night (this cannot be, conſidering the time of the Year, yet <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
f. 625. b.</hi> ſays it) I think it ſhould have been from ten in
the Morning: When the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, double in Number to the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> prevailed, and took the <hi>Garland</hi> Frigat, and burnt the
<hi>Bonadventure,</hi> and ſunk three more: on the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſide, one of
their Flag-Ships was blown up, and all the Souldiers and Mariners
were loſt but two, and <hi>Van Trump</hi>'s and <hi>De Ruiter</hi>'s Ships much
damaged; and if the Night had not favoured the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the
whole Fleet would have been in danger to be loſt.</p>
                  <p>After the Fight <hi>Van Trump</hi> ſailed to the Weſtward, to convoy
home the <hi>Dutch-French</hi> Fleets; and now the <hi>Dutch</hi> were ſo elated
by their Victory, that they talk'd of nothing but blocking up the
River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and forcing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to a Peace, but they
were miſtaken in their Meaſures.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Rump,</hi> with incredible Diligence and Conduct, repair'd
their ſhatter'd Fleet, and fitted up another, to the Amazement of
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> commanded by <hi>Blake, Dean</hi> and <hi>Monk</hi> (newly come
out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the reaſon whereof you'll hear by and by) and
upon the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> ſet Sail from <hi>Queenborough</hi> with 60 Men
of War, from whence they ſailed to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> where they were
joined with 20 Men of War more, and from thence ſailed over
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:60932:182"/>
againſt <hi>Portland,</hi> half Seas over, to call <hi>Trump</hi> to an Account for
paſſing the Channel without the <hi>Rump</hi>'s leave: and upon the <hi>18th</hi>
of <hi>February</hi> the Southern Ships of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet deſcried the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, conſiſting of 76 Men of War, which had the Charge
of convoying 30 Merchant Ships.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Blake</hi> and <hi>Dean</hi> were in the <hi>Triumph,</hi> and with 12 Sail more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
the Groſs of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet; and the <hi>Triumph</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
700 Cannon-ſhot in her Hull, was bravely relieved by <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
(the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet being not able to come up.)</p>
                  <p>But when the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet came, a moſt furious
Fight ſucceeded, wherein the <hi>Dutch</hi> had ſix Men of War taken and
ſunk, whereof one was a Flag-Ship; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> loſt not one
Ship, tho many were diſabled and ſent into <hi>Portſmouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next day after in the Morning, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet was diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſeven Leagues off <hi>Weymouth,</hi> whither the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ply'd, and in
the Afternoon engaged them with like Fury they did the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
<hi>Trump</hi> put his Merchant Men before him, and after the firſt
Shock, fought retreating towards the Coaſt of <hi>Bulloign;</hi> but in his
way thither, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Frigats at large took many of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
Men, and <hi>Lawſon</hi> boarded and took one of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Men
of War.</p>
                  <p>The next day, <hi>Sunday</hi> the <hi>12th,</hi> early in the Morning, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
renewed the Fight, which continued till four in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon;
then the Wind proving croſs to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at N. N. E.
<hi>Trump</hi> got to <hi>Calais</hi> Sands, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> thought fit to purſue
him no further.</p>
                  <p>In theſe three Fights the <hi>Dutch</hi> loſt eleven of their Men of
War, and 30 of their Merchant Ships; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> loſt but one
Ship, the <hi>Sampſon,</hi> but the Captain, <hi>Button,</hi> and moſt of the Men
were ſaved, tho the Captain was much wounded.</p>
                  <p>This Victory of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> was ſo much more ſurprizing to the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> by how much they expected <hi>Van Trump</hi> ſhould have block'd
up the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and obliged the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to ſeek a Peace:
but the Succeſs proving ſo contrary, the common People in the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Provinces were all in an Uproar and Tumult, whereupon
the Province of <hi>Holland</hi> (without the Conſent of the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
which was contrary to the Conſtitution of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
did privately imploy Colonel <hi>Doleman</hi> and ſome others
(gaining to them <hi>Hugh Peters)</hi> to try the Inclinations of the
<hi>Rump</hi> for a Peace.</p>
                  <p>Here take notice, that King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second employ'd one
Mr. <hi>Stubbe,</hi> commonly call'd Dr. <hi>Stubbe,</hi> (who was a Man of great
Parts) to write a Vindication of the ſecond <hi>Dutch</hi> War in his
Reign, whereby <hi>Stubbe</hi> had the opportunity of inſpecting all the
Manuſcripts relating to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Treaty with the <hi>Dutch</hi> in this
Treaty; for the <hi>Rump</hi> refuſed to treat with them but in writing:
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:60932:182"/>
and out of theſe, and <hi>Leo ab Aitzma</hi> (a moſt faithful Collector
of the Treaties of Peace and War and Commerce between the
Princes and States of his time, and ſometimes before) Dr. <hi>Stubbe</hi>
hath, I believe, faithfully ſet out this Treaty of Peace between

                  <p>The <hi>Rump</hi> did not refuſe to treat of a Peace upon juſt and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Terms, but not in <hi>Holland</hi> or any Neutral Place; nor would
they condeſcend to any Treaty before <hi>Holland</hi> made the firſt Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in Writing. Whereupon the States of <hi>Holland</hi> upon the <hi>18th</hi>
of <hi>March,</hi> by their Secretary <hi>Herbert Van Beaumont,</hi> ſent the <hi>Rump</hi>
a canting and equivocal Letter, wherein I cannot find one Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical
Propoſition, and wherein the ſacred Name of God is more
rent and torn than I can find in any of our Enthuſiaſts; of their
Zeal for the Reformed Religion, much endanger'd by this War,
and the Joys the Enemies of it conceived thereby; and of their
Deſire of preventing the further Effuſion of Chriſtian Blood; <hi>and
carried on by a pious Zeal, and in no wiſe conſtrained by any other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration:</hi>
That Conſideration may be had what may be done
for the Honour and Glory of God, and the good of each State;
whereupon, without doubt, the good God for his Name ſake, and
by the Inſpiration of proper and fit Expedients, will give his
Bleſſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Letter you may read at large in <hi>Stubbe</hi>'s Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,

                  <p>The <hi>Rump</hi> having got this Letter, and to make a further Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction
in the <hi>States General,</hi> ſent an Anſwer the firſt of <hi>April
1653,</hi> to the <hi>States of Holland,</hi> and a Letter to the <hi>States General:</hi>
that to the <hi>States of Holland</hi> was,</p>
                  <p>That the Inconveniences to Religion in general, and to the Trade and
Liberties of each Nation, were ſuch as any man might have foreſeen;
and that none could be ignorant how requiſite it was for both Nations to
preſerve a good Correſpondence and Amity together; that the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
had not omitted any thing on their parts, but the <hi>Dutch</hi> had aſſaulted
them in the midſt of a Treaty for a ſtrict <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion; and their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
had uſed ſuch Tergiverſation, as made them juſtly imagine that
their ſenſe of things was different from what they now profeſſed. That
the good Endeavours of the Parliament were anſwered with unuſual
Preparations, Acts of Hoſtility, and other extraordinary Proceedings
thereupon. That they had this Comfort and Satisfaction in their own
Minds amidſt the Troubles and Calamities of War, that they had with
all Sincerity done what lay in their Power to obviate all the Evils
ſpecified: That they did look upon the Overtures of <hi>Holland,</hi> if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the <hi>States General,</hi> to be an effectual means for compoſing
this unwelcom War; however, the Parliament having diſcharged their
Duty, would with Patience acquieſce in the Iſſue of Providence, whereof
they had ſo gracious Experience.</p>

                     <hi>That to the</hi> States General <hi>was,</hi> That there could be no doubt of
the ſincere Affection and good Will which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did bear to the
<hi>United Provinces;</hi> ſo that it might be well imagined, that they were
really inclined, by just and honourable means, to extinguiſh the Fire of
War, ſtop the Effuſſion of Chriſtian Blood, and reſtore Amity between
the two Nations: That as they had not been wanting in the Beginning
to prevent the enſuing Calamities, ſo they were not altered with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
from their former good Intentions: That they were ready, upon
the Grounds expreſſed in the Letter from the Provincial <hi>States of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Friezland,</hi> friendly to compoſe Differences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Letter had the deſired Effect of the <hi>Rump,</hi> for the reſt of
the Provinces complained, that <hi>Holland</hi> had broke the Union, which
that State would have ſalved by a manifeſt Lie, in denying they
ever wrote ſuch a Letter: However, the reſt of the Provinces,
fearing the Calamity would be common to them all if the War
continued, did conſent to a Treaty of Peace with the <hi>Rump.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the <hi>Rump,</hi> in their Letter to the <hi>States,</hi> refuſed to give
them any other Title than the <hi>States General,</hi> notwithſtanding
the Title of <hi>High and Mighty,</hi> obtained at the Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi>
not five Years before; nor did they aſſume this Title, when they
returned their Anſwer to the Parliament of <hi>the Commonwealth of
England.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>To theſe Letters the</hi> States General <hi>returned this Anſwer to the
Parliament of the Commonwealth of</hi> England, That they always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured,
with a good and ſincere Intention, not only to keep, but to
augment more and more, all manner of Friendſhip and Correſpondence
with the ſaid Parliament; and would now do any thing that might
contribute to ſo pious and Chriſtian an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, deſiring a Neutral
Place, and Plenipotentiaries might be appointed forthwith on both ſides.
<hi>But before this Anſwer was returned, a new face of things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd

                  </p>
                  <p>Herein I take the Confidence to ſay, that as the Covenanters ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
the Royaliſts was the Cauſe of the Ruin of the Covenanting
Parliament; ſo was <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Victory over the King at <hi>Worceſter,</hi>

You have heard how <hi>Cromwel</hi> felt the Pulſe of the Lawyers and

were of Opinion, that no Settlement could be made without
ſome mixture of Monarchy, and that it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſomewhat of a mixt Monarchy, would be very effectual; but this
ſomewhat of a Settlement of mixt Monarchy he reſerved for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
but herein he found three <hi>Rubs,</hi> and <hi>Rump,</hi> the Duke of

ignorant of Sea Affairs.</p>

enter'd into a long Dialogue with Commiſſioner <hi>Whitlock,</hi> which
you may read at large in his <hi>Memoirs,</hi> fol. 523, 524, 525, 526.
wherein <hi>Cromwel</hi> takes notice, as well as <hi>Whitlock,</hi> of the Danger
of a Victorious Army lying idle in Peace, more than in War; and
of their murmuring in not being rewarded according to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts;
and that the Army had a ſtrange Diſguſt againſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
for their Pride, Ambition, Self-ſeeking, engroſſing all
Places of Honour and Profit to themſelves and Friends, and their
daily breaking forth into new and violent Factions; their Delays in
Buſineſs, and Deſign to perpetuate themſelves; their medling in
private Matters, contrary to the Inſtitution of Parliament; their
Injuſtice and Partiality in thoſe Matters, and the ſcandalous Lives
of ſome of the chief of them: ſo that unleſs there be ſome Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
ſo full and high as to reſtrain and keep things in better Order,
and that may put a ſtop to theſe Exorbitancies, it will be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
in humane Reaſon, to prevent our Ruin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whitlock</hi> magnifies <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Government of the Army, yet
finds great Difficulty how he could reform the Parliament, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſubordinate to them, and having taken his Commiſſion from
them, and hopes the greater part of the Members are not ſuch,
as <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſays, when great Matters come before them.</p>
                  <p>Cromwel <hi>anſwered,</hi> My Lord, There is little hopes of a good Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
by them, <hi>really</hi> there is not, but a great deal of fear that they
will deſtroy again what the Lord hath ſo graciouſly done for them and
us: we all forget God, and God will forget us, and give us up to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion;
and theſe Men will help it on if they be ſuffered to proceed in
their ways: ſome Courſe must be taken to curb and reſtrain them, or
we ſhall be ruin'd by them.</p>

Whitlock <hi>anſwered,</hi> We our ſelves have owned them the Supreme
Power, and taken our Commiſſions from them; and how to reſtrain
them after this, will be hard to find out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cromwel.</hi> What if a Man ſhould take upon him to be King?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whitlock.</hi> I think the Remedy worſe than the Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cromwel.</hi> Why do you think ſo?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whitlock.</hi> 
                     <q>As to your own Perſon, the Title of a King would
be of no Advantage, becauſe you have the Kingly Power in
you already; concerning the Militia, as you are General; as to
the Nomination of Civil Officers, thoſe whom you think fitteſt
are ſeldom refuſed; and tho you have no Negative Vote in
paſſing Laws, yet what you diſlike is not eaſily carried; and the
Taxes are already ſettled, and in your Power to diſpoſe the
Moneys raiſed; and as to the foreign Affairs, tho the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Part be to the Parliament, yet the Expectation of good or
bad Succeſs, is from your Excellency; and particular Solicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of foreign Miniſters are made to you only.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>So that I apprehend indeed leſs Envy and Danger, but not
leſs real Opportunities of doing Good, in your being General,
than it would be if you had aſſumed the Title of King.</q> 
                     <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi>
after enlarged himſelf, <q>How dangerous it would be to <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
to aſſume the Title, for that the main Controverſy between
us and our Adverſaries, is to be eſtabliſhed in a Monarchy or
a Free State, and moſt of our Friends have engaged with us
upon the Hopes of a Free State, and to that end have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
all their Hazards and Difficulties; if then your Excellency
ſhall take upon you the Title of a King, this ſtate of your Cauſe
will be thereby wholly determined, and Monarchy eſtabliſhed
in your Perſon; and the Queſtion will be no more, whether
our Government ſhall be by a Monarch or Free State, but,
whether <hi>Cromwel</hi> or <hi>Stuart</hi> ſhall be our King?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After <hi>Whitlock</hi> deſired his Excellency to conſider his Condition;
<hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>You are environ'd with ſecret Enemies: upon your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
the publick Enemy, the Officers of the Army account
themſelves all Victors,</q> and have had an equal ſhare with you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Succeſs which God hath given us hath not a little elated
their Minds, and many of them are turbulent and buſy Spirits,
and are not without their Deſigns, how they may diſmount
your Excellency, and ſome of them get into the Saddle; how
they may bring you down,</q> and ſet up themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>They want not Counſel and Encouragement herein, it may
be from ſome Members of Parliament, who may be jealous of
your Power and Greatneſs, leſt you ſhould grow too high for
them, and in time over-maſter them; and they will plot to
bring you down firſt,</q> or to clip your Wings.</p>

Cromwel <hi>thank'd</hi> Whitlock <hi>for his good Advice; then ask'd him,</hi>
What were his Thoughts for Prevention of the Miſchiefs which hung
over our Heads?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whitlock</hi> adviſed him to make a private Treaty with the King of
<q>
                        <hi>Scots,</hi> whereby he did not doubt, but in the Condition the
King was in, but <hi>Cromwel</hi> might ſecure himſelf and Friends,
and might make himſelf and Poſterity as great and permanent
to all humane Probability, as ever any Subject; and provide for
his Friends,</q> as well as ſecure our ſpiritual and civil Liberties.
<hi>Cromwel</hi> heard him, and ſeem'd diſpleas'd, and brake off the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
and his Carriage to <hi>Whitlock,</hi> from that time, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the manifold Pretenſions of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and
<hi>Rump,</hi> wherein God's ſacred Name was ſo often expoſed to cover
their Hypocriſy of ſincere Love and Friendſhip of either <hi>State</hi> to
one another, and of their Zeal for Propagation of the Honour of
God, and encreaſing the true Reformed Religion, neither <hi>State</hi>
truſted the other, but made all imaginable Preparations for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the War; and the <hi>Rump,</hi> for Encouragement of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
order'd them ſome Pay before-hand, and Subſiſtence for
their Families in their Abſence; and that for every Ship which
ſhall be adjudged good Prize, 40 <hi>l. per Tun,</hi> and 6 <hi>l.</hi> for every
Piece of Cannon taken or found in Prize-Ships, and 10 <hi>l.</hi> for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Piece of Cannon which ſhould be taken on board of any Ship
they ſhould take or fire, to be diſtributed to the Seamen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

in the Parliament's Service within 40 Days, ſhould receive
a Month's Pay, not to be paſſed upon Account; and Hoſpitals
provided for ſick and wounded Men. This was in <hi>Jan.</hi> 1652.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Ambition to be uppermoſt, could no longer be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt;
but now the <hi>Rump</hi> being the only Obſtacle, he firſt ſet the
Officers of his Army to bait the <hi>Rump,</hi> which they did with the
Words <hi>Cromwel</hi> put in their Mouth, and which he before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to <hi>Whitlock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During theſe Commotions, <hi>Doleman</hi> and <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> ſet on by
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> did make very ſubmiſſive Applications to the <hi>Council of
State</hi> and <hi>Rump, confeſſing they were not able to contest with the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſance
of</hi> England; offering to acknowledg to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas, and to pay 300000 <hi>l.</hi> to the <hi>Rump:</hi>
but the <hi>Dutch</hi> above all things dreading the <hi>Rump,</hi> animated <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
with the Promiſe of a far greater Sum, in caſe he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the <hi>Rump.</hi> See <hi>Stubbe,</hi> pag. 81.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Dutch</hi> dreaded the <hi>Rump,</hi> the <hi>Rump</hi> did not leſs dread
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> and therefore made their Application to <hi>Monk</hi> for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
but failed, for <hi>Cromwel</hi> had gained him before, and he
diſcovered all to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and that he had no Concern for them,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:60932:185"/>
nor Obligation to them, as you may ſee in Dr. <hi>Gumble</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtory of</hi>
Monk'<hi>s Life,</hi> pag. 73. So that <hi>Monk</hi> was not now of the ſame
Mind as he was afterward when <hi>Lambert</hi> turn'd the <hi>Rump</hi> out of
doors.</p>
                  <p>All other Obſtacles thus removed, and <hi>Cromwel</hi> heightned in
his frantick Reſolutions, by the Expectation of Mountains of Gold
from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> upon the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> with a Party of Soldiers
with him, marched to the Houſe, and led a File of Muſqueteers
in with him, and the reſt he placed at the Door of the Houſe, in
the Lobby; and entring the Houſe in furious manner, bid the
Speaker leave the Chair, and told the Houſe, <q>That they had
ſat long enough,</q> unleſs they had done more Good <hi>(I could
have told him, they had done two good Deeds for him; one, in taking
away the King's Life, to let him into his Throne; the other, that they
had made him General, to enable him to turn them out of doors)</hi>
                     <q>That ſome of them were Whore-maſters, looking towards <hi>Henry
Martin</hi> and Sir <hi>Peter Wentworth;</hi> That others of them were
Drunkards, and ſome corrupt and unjuſt Men, and ſcandalous
to the Profeſſion of the Goſpel; and that it was not fit they
ſhould ſit any longer as a Parliament, and deſired them to go
away.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Speaker not ſtirring from his Seat, Col. <hi>Harriſon</hi> took
him by the Arm to remove him from his Seat; which when the
Speaker ſaw, he left the Chair: Some of the Members roſe up to
anſwer <hi>Cromwel,</hi> but he would ſuffer none to ſpeak but himſelf.
He bid one of the Soldiers <hi>Take away that Fool's Bawble, the Mace;</hi>
and ſtay'd himſelf till all the Members were out, and then cauſed
the Doors to be ſhut up.</p>
                  <p>We will look upon this Act in a threefold Conſideration; <hi>viz.</hi>
In the Doers; to whom done; and in the Manner of it.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>The Doers were the</hi> Rump'<hi>s Servants, raiſed by the</hi> Rump,
<hi>and no ways provoked by the</hi> Rump. So little do Benefits received
by ill Men create any Obligation of Gratitude in thoſe who receive
them.</p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>Rump</hi> were a Parliament which were impowered to make
War or Peace, or were not; if they were not, then <hi>Cromwel</hi> and
his Aſſiſtants Commiſſion from the <hi>Rump</hi> to judg the King to Death,
and all the Acts of Hostility which they did during theſe Wars, were
<hi>Murder</hi> or <hi>Rapine:</hi> but if they were a Parliament, who might grant
Commiſſions in War, and make Laws, then <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Aſſiſtants
were greater Rebels and Violators of the Liberties of the Nation, than
either the <hi>Iriſh</hi> or <hi>Scots</hi> were against the King, or the <hi>Royaliſts</hi> againſt
the Parliament; for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> pretended Grievances and
Oppreſſions against the preſent Powers, whereas <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
pretended not one categorical Complaint against the <hi>Rump;</hi> and
the <hi>Royaliſts</hi> fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ght to preſerve the <hi>Eſtabliſh'd Laws</hi> and <hi>Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:60932:185"/>
of the Nation, which <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Aſſiſtants did not. Beſides,
herein <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Aſſiſtants aſſumed a Power above <hi>Regal,</hi> in
depoſing the <hi>Rump,</hi> if it were a Rightful Parliament, which the King
could not do without their Conſent.</p>
                  <p>3. For the Manner of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Depoſing the <hi>Rump,</hi> it was ſo
barbarous and rude, as I do not think you will find the like among the
most <hi>Savage People,</hi> unleſs it were when <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Agents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
the <hi>Secluded Members:</hi> Yet ſure there was a Divine Juſtice in
both; for as the Covenanting Members expelled the <hi>Royaliſts</hi> for not
taking the Covenant, or joining with them in the <hi>Innovations</hi> which
the <hi>Covenanters</hi> brought into the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> ſo <hi>Cromwel</hi> and
the <hi>Rump</hi> expelled them for their Covenanting, and ſet up themſelves
inſtead of them; and now <hi>Cromwel</hi> does the like by the <hi>Rump,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thus, by their own mercenary Servants, and not a Sword drawn
in their Defence, fell the Haughty and Victorious <hi>Rump,</hi> whoſe
mighty Actions will ſcarcely find Belief in future Generations;
and to ſay the Truth, they were a Race of Men moſt indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
induſtrious in Buſineſs, always ſeeking for Men fit for it, and
never preferring any for Favour, nor by Importunity. You ſcarce
ever heard of any revolting from them in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> or
<hi>Ireland,</hi> during their time, except by the <hi>Levellers,</hi> 1649. See
<hi>Whitlock</hi>'s <hi>Memoirs,</hi> fol. 385, 386, 387. No Murmur or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of Sea-men or Soldiers employ'd by them either by Sea or
Land, for want of Pay: In all the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> during the
<hi>Dutch</hi> War, Money or Credit was found to pay off the Sea-men
whenever their Ships were deſigned to be laid up. Nor do I find
they ever preſs'd either Soldiers or Seamen in all their Wars.
And as they excelled thus in their Management of Civil Affairs,
ſo it muſt be owned, they exerciſed in Matters Eccleſiaſtick no
ſuch Severities as either the <hi>Covenanters,</hi> or others before them,
did upon ſuch as diſſented from them.</p>
                  <p>And as the <hi>Rump</hi> were thus induſtrious and victorious in War,
ſo were they not negligent in reforming the Abuſes in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Common Laws; and to that end, in <hi>October</hi> 1650, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
that all the Books of the Laws be put into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that
all Writs, Proceſs, and Returns thereof, and all Patents, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions,
Indictments, Judgments, Records, and all Proceedings
in Courts of Juſtice, ſhall be in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, and not in
the <hi>Latin,</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> or any other Language. See <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs,</hi>

                  </p>

                  <p>Whether the <hi>Rump</hi> paſſed theſe into Laws, I do not find; but
if they did not, they might have done, if <hi>Cromwel</hi> had let them
alone: and they ſat not four Years and three Months.</p>
                  <p>But how induſtrious and victorious ſoever the <hi>Rump</hi> was in
War, they were not ſo wiſe in Counſel, by making the <hi>Act of
Navigation:</hi> and tho we have before demonſtrated the manifold
Miſchiefs and Inconveniences which this Law has brought upon
this Nation, and ſhall more particularly hereafter (if God plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes)
in Anſwer to thoſe Reaſons which Sir <hi>Joſiah Child</hi> and Sir
<hi>Francis Brewſier</hi> pretend in Defence of it; yet it's fit that we here
ſhew, how that the <hi>Rump</hi> was miſtaken, as well in the End, as
Cauſes of this Law.</p>
                  <p>If we look upon <hi>Britain,</hi> it is an Iſland, and divided into two
Kingdoms, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> and both theſe Kingdoms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were united under one King, <hi>viz. James</hi> I. by imm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Preſcriptions, were poſſeſſed of the Sovereignty of the Sea
adjoining their Coaſts, wherein no Nation (before King <hi>James</hi> I.)
preſumed to fiſh, without Agreement or Leave firſt obtained
from thoſe Kings.</p>
                  <p>The firſt who preſumed to fiſh in theſe Seas, without ſuch Licence
or Agreement, were the <hi>Dutch;</hi> yet never diſputed their Right to
it, before <hi>Grotius</hi> (and he only that I can find) diſputed it. The
<hi>Dutch</hi> Fiſhery upon the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> is the
Foundation of all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Greatneſs at Sea, and wherein they
employ more Shipping and Mariners than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do in all
their foreign Trades; with this further Advantage to the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
that they have all their Mariners at home, or near home, ſo that
they are always ready, upon all Occaſions, to ſerve the <hi>States;</hi>
and there being but little Difference of Climate, are healthful and
ſtrong: whereas the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in their long Voyages, eſpecially to
the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-Indies,</hi> are far from aſſiſting the Nation in time
of need; and by the Diverſities of Climates, and eating over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalted
Meats, and drinking ſowr Drinks, cauſes ſuch Sickneſs and
Mortality amongſt them, that it's a Queſtion, whether we loſe
more Sea-men, or make more Mariners in them; and thoſe which
ſurvive are ſo feeble, that a healthy Mariner will beat two of
them.</p>

                     <pb n="365" facs="tcp:60932:186"/>
The <hi>Rump</hi> therefore ſhould have conſidered from what Cauſe the
<hi>Dutch</hi> were enabled to carry on this Fiſhery in Foreign Trades ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive
to the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> And firſt negatively, That the <hi>Dutch</hi> were
not enabled to do this from any Principals of their own, for they
had neither Timber to build Ships, nor Pitch, Tar, Hemp or Flax,
or Iron for fitting them up; nor Salt to cure their Fiſh; their
Ports from which they fiſhed, not half ſo good, or a quarter ſo
many as the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and the Coaſts upon which they caught theſe
Fiſh, more convenient for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> than the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman</hi>
of a ſtronger Conſtitution than a <hi>Dutch-man,</hi> and tenfold
more; ſo that herein the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had all natural Advantages above
the <hi>Dutch.</hi> Now let's ſee how the <hi>Dutch</hi> could do this.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> tho there were tenfold more Men in <hi>England</hi> than
in <hi>Holland,</hi> could not employ one Man to ten which the <hi>Dutch</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in their Fiſheries upon the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi>
for theſe Reaſons. Firſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> employed and gave Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to all ſorts of People in theſe Fiſheries, as well Foreigners as
Natives; whereas Foreigners fiſhing from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ports, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
by a Law in <hi>England;</hi> nor are Foreigners only excluded here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
but all the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> being Corporations, the Freemen
in them make the reſt of the Nation Foreigners to them: ſo that
the Fiſheries upon the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> between
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> are of a general Freedom in the <hi>Dutch Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands;</hi>
and the Freemen of the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> who being
few, and generally Beggars, have few Men, and leſs Means, to be
Competitors with the <hi>Dutch</hi> in theſe Fiſheries. But the <hi>Rump</hi> not
conſidering theſe Cauſes, but reſtraining this Fiſhery only to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-men,</hi>
at leaſt <hi>three Fourths Engliſh,</hi> have made the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in no
Capacity to be Competitors with the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the Foreign Trades
of the Fiſh caught upon the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the <hi>Dutch</hi> had their Agents, Factors, and Correſpondents in
<hi>France, Spain, Portugal, Italy,</hi> and other Places, for a Market for
the Fiſh they caught, whereas the Poverty of our Corporation-Men
denied the <hi>Engliſh</hi> this Benefit.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Rump</hi> in making the Act of Navigation, did not conſider
that the Fiſh caught on the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> coſt
nothing but the catching; ſo that they who can catch them cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
and cure them beſt, are ſure of a Foreign Market againſt
them whoſe Charges are more, and they ignorant in the Curing of
them: The Rump therefore reſtraining the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to fiſh in Ships
40 <hi>per Cent.</hi> dearer than the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and 40 <hi>per Cent.</hi> dearer ſailed,
(and who knew not how to cure <hi>Herring</hi> and <hi>Cod-fiſh</hi> ſo well as the
<hi>Dutch)</hi> has eternally fixed the Fiſheries in the <hi>Dutch,</hi> excluſive
to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſo long as the Act ſtands in force; and how this has
made good the Title of their Act, <hi>For Encouragement of encreaſing
Shipping and Navigation,</hi> let any Man, not in the Temper the Rump
was when they made this Act, judg.</p>

                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:60932:187"/>
The Rump ſhould have encountred the <hi>Dutch</hi> with their own
Weapons, and made all the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> not only free to all
<hi>Engliſh</hi> in theſe Fiſheries, but to Foreigners; and made them free to
import all ſorts of Timber for building Veſſels for theſe Fiſheries;
as alſo for rough Hemp, Flax, Pitch and Tar, for fitting up Veſſels
for theſe Fiſheries, ſo as we might have had the Materials as cheap
as the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and alſo have given Rewards and other Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to Foreigners to inſtruct us how to build Veſſels as cheap and
convenient for the Fiſheries as the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and how to cure them;
and denied the <hi>Dutch</hi> the Benefit of drying their Nets in the Fiſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
or to take in freſh Water or Proviſions in their Fiſheries, as
the <hi>Dutch</hi> do to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in their Plantations in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi>
and have taken off the Impoſts in <hi>England,</hi> which the <hi>Dutch</hi> pay
in <hi>Holland;</hi> and then the Rump might have beaten the <hi>Dutch</hi> out
of theſe Fiſheries without fighting with them, and made our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
Towns as great and flouriſhing as thoſe in <hi>Holland.</hi> But the
Temper the <hi>Rump</hi> was then in would not admit of any of theſe
Conſiderations; and it's admirable to me, that all the Parliaments
ſince have been of the <hi>Rump</hi>'s Temper herein, and never taken
theſe things into Conſideration; tho the Coaſt-Towns of <hi>England</hi>
are not only ruined by the Act of Navigation hereby, and the Fiſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
not only on the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> but thoſe to
<hi>Iſeland</hi> and <hi>Greenland,</hi> ruin'd only by this Law, without poſſibility
of retrieving them, ſo long as it ſtands in Force.</p>
                  <p>If the reſtraining the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in their Fiſheries, to <hi>Engliſh</hi>-built
Ships, and ſail'd by <hi>three Fourths Engliſh,</hi> be ſo pernicious to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> in our Fiſheries, the Reaſons are the ſame in the Foreign
Vent of our Native Commodities: for obliging the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to
vend the Manufactures of the Nation in theſe near double as dear
built Ships, and ſailed by near double Men, and permitting the
<hi>Dutch</hi> to buy our Manufactures, the <hi>Dutch</hi> by their Cheapneſs, and
more convenient building of Ships, has outed this Nation of their
Navigation to <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and all the Kingdoms and Countries within
the <hi>Sound</hi> with them, as much to the Encreaſe of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
as the leſſening of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as this Law is ſo injurious to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in our Fiſheries,
and Foreign Vent of our Manufactures, ſo it is not leſs in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of Foreign Commodities, by reſtraining the Import of
them to <hi>Engliſh</hi>-built Ships, and ſailed by <hi>three fourths Engliſh,</hi> and
the Natives of thoſe Places from whence they ſhall be imported,
whether they have Ships or not. I'll give but two Inſtances here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<hi>viz.</hi> in our Trades to <hi>Norway</hi> for Timber, Pitch and Tar,
and to <hi>Liefland</hi> and <hi>Pruſſia</hi> for rough Hemp and Flax; for which
Trades the <hi>Engliſh</hi> never built one Ship ſince this Act; and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Dearneſs and Inconveniences of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships in
theſe Trades, the <hi>Norwegians</hi> have encreaſed their Navigation from
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:60932:187"/>
6 Ships of about 60 Tun, to above 200 of three, four, five and ſix
hundred Tun; and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> pay near double the Price for theſe
they did before the Act.</p>
                  <p>And as the Inhabitants of <hi>Liefland</hi> and <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> rarely or never
trade with us in rough Hemp and Flax; ſo the <hi>Dutch</hi> importing
theſe by the Cheapneſs of their Navigation <hi>one third</hi> cheaper than
the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and when they are made into the Manufactures of
Cordage, Sails and Nets, the <hi>Dutch,</hi> by the Act of Navigation may
import them; whereby the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in their Fiſheries, and the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Vent of their Commodities, have loſt the Manufactures of
them, and by a Foreign Expence buy them of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and
<hi>French,</hi> as much to their enriching and Employment of their
People, as to our Impoveriſhment, and the Loſs of employing
ours. It's fit to give this light Touch of the Miſchiefs and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
this Act has brought upon the Nation; but hereafter I
ſhall enlarge upon them, when I reply upon Sir <hi>Joſiah Child</hi> and
Sir <hi>Francis Brewſter</hi>'s Defence of it, as before.</p>

                  <p>WHEN Men forſake the plain and foreknown Ways of
Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, they not only run into Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
or contrary Extreams; but theſe they endeavour to ſanctify
by previous ſwearing to them, and impoſing them upon other Men.
In <hi>Scotland</hi> 1638, the <hi>Scots,</hi> without the King's Conſent, made
their Covenant, wherein they abjure Epiſcopacy, and ſwear a
mutual Defence of one another herein, againſt all Perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
without excepting the King; and impoſed this upon all
Sorts of People with Violence, and Menaces, as beating, tearing
of Clothes, drawing of Blood, and expoſing thouſands to Injuries
and Reproaches; and notwithſtanding ſeveral Laws to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
expelled all Profeſſors of Colleges, and Miniſters out of their
Places, who refuſed to ſubſcribe their Covenant. See <hi>Baker</hi>'s <hi>Chron.
fol. 461. a.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To encounter the <hi>Scots</hi> Covenant by a contrary Extream, the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Convocation, in the Year 1640, after the King had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
the Parliament, impoſed, without Conſent in Parliament,
an Oath, wherein they ſwear, <hi>That they approve the Doctrine and
Diſcipline of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as containing all things neceſſary
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:60932:188"/>
to Salvation; that they will not endeavour to bring in any</hi> Popiſh <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
contrary to it: That they will not conſent to alter the Government
of this Church, by Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Deans and Arch-Deacons,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>as it now ſtands, and ought by right to ſtand; nor to ſubject it to
the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations and Superſttitions of</hi> Rome: <hi>That this they do plainly
and ſincerely acknowledg and ſwear, and do it heartily and willingly.</hi>
Thus was God's Sacred Name expoſed to cover their Ambitious
Deſigns, on both ſides, and for which neither gave any Reaſon.
Nor did this Convocation ſtay here, but impoſed, without Conſent
of Parliament, ſix Subſidies upon the Clergy, to be paid in ſix
Years, for carrying on a War againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> the refuſers to be
ſuſpended and excommunicated: Thus you ſee now, <hi>In Nomine
Domini,</hi> on both ſides, theſe Feuds began at the Clergy; and the
King to ſecure the Convocation, ſet Guards about <hi>Weſtminſter Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Here let's examine and compare theſe two Oaths: The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters
in</hi> Scotland <hi>ſwear,</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>That according to their Places and
Callings, they ſhall endeavour the Preſervation of the Reformed
Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and
Government:</hi>
                     </q> At this Time there was no Reformed Church in
<hi>Scotland</hi> but the Epiſcopal, unleſs the <hi>Scots</hi> Covenanters erected another:
So here the <hi>Scots</hi> do not diſtinguiſh, which Church they ſwear to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to preſerve; nor ſay what the Doctrine, Diſcipline, Worſhip
and Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was. So that herein; in
the firſt part of the Oath, they ſwear equivocally; and in the ſecond,
they ſwear by Implicit Faith, without declaring wherein their Doctrine,
Diſcipline, Worſhip and Government does conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>That they ſhall alſo endeavour the Extirpation of</hi> Popery,
<hi>Prelacy,</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>Superſtition, Hereſy, Schiſm, Prophaneneſs,</hi> &amp;c. All
Oaths are to be taken in Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> of what a Man knows, or truly
intends: Can any Man believe; that every <hi>Scot</hi> which ſwears the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
knows what Popery, Prelacy, Superſtition, Schiſm and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs
are, eſpecially when they have an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> joined to them? I do not
believe that ever the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other Nation, ever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
ſuch an <hi>Equivocal</hi> and <hi>Canting</hi> Oath, as this Covenant, by a
Rout of Men, and contrary to the eſtabliſht Government in being, and
againſt the King's expreſs Will.</p>
                  <p>And to make all ſure, they ſwear, <q>to defend all thoſe that
ſhall enter into this Covenant, and ſhall zealouſly and conſtantly
all the Days of their Lives continue therein.</q> 
                     <hi>But God ſhall ſoon
blaſt this abominable Swearing, to the Deſtruction of theſe Covenanters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Oath of the Covenant was purely promiſſory, wherein they
ſwear what wondrous Acts they would do in Preſervation of their
Kirk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for the Extirpation of Popery, Prelacy, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and
for the mutual Defence of one another. But the firſt Part of the
Convocation-Oath is aſſertory, wherein they ſwear, that they
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:60932:188"/>
approve the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as
containing all things neceſſary to Salvation; ſo as there is no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
need of ſearching the Scriptures, and no Man needs further
to ſeek his Salvation with Fear and Trembling, if he be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
in the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
The next part of it is negatively Promiſſory, that they will not
bring in any <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine contrary to it. The third part of it
is partly Promiſſory, and partly Aſſertory; Promiſſory, not to
give Conſent to alter the Government of this Church by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops,
Biſhops, Deans, Arch-Deacons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Aſſertory, as it now
ſtands, and ought to ſtand. The fourth part is Promiſſory, not
to ſubject it to the Uſurpations and Superſitions of <hi>Rome (without
declaring what theſe were.)</hi> The laſt part of this Oath is Aſſertory,
That this they do plainly and ſincerely acknowledg and ſwear, and
do it heartily, willingly and truly.</p>
                  <p>Now let's ſee the Succeſs of this jumbled Oath, and Grant of
theſe Subſidies; firſt, the King never got one Groat of them.
Secondly, The very next Year after, <hi>viz. March 10th,</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
voted that no Biſhop ſhould have any Vote in Parliament;
nor any judicial Power in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> nor Authority in
Temporal Matters; and that no Clergy-man ſhall be in Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Peace: and upon the <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>June</hi> the High Commiſſion
Court, and <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> (wherein <hi>Laud</hi> and the Prerogative
Clergy plaid their Pranks) were aboliſhed by Act of Parliament:
and ſoon after, <hi>viz. January 12th,</hi> Twelve of the Biſhops were
committed to the Tower for High Treaſon, for proteſting againſt
all Votes and Orders of the Lords during their Abſence; and ſoon
after the King paſſed a Bill for taking away the Biſhops Votes in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
ſo little Succeſs had the Clergy in their Convocation-Oath.</p>
                  <p>As the Clergy, without Conſent in Parliament, impoſed the
Convocation-Oath upon the reſt of the Clergy: So the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(I mean the Lords and Commons) without the Conſent of
the King, impoſed upon the Subjects a Vow and Proteſtation to
maintain and defend, ſo far as lawfully may be, the true Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, expreſſed in the Doctrine of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and according to the Duty of the Allegiance to his
Majeſty's Royal Perſon, Honour and Eſtate, to defend the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
of Parliament, and Liberties of the Subject; and by all juſt
and honourable Ways, endeavour to preſerve the Union and
Peace of the Three Kingdoms; and neither for fear, nor other
reſpect, relinquiſh the Promiſe, Vow and Proteſtation. See <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>'s
<hi>Hiſtory, fol. 508. b.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Lords and Commons were not conſtant to their Vow; for
within leſs than two Years after, they impoſe their Solemn League
and Covenant (being baſely impoſed upon them by the <hi>Scots)</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the reſt of their Fellow-Subjects, with all the <hi>Scotiſh Cant,</hi> and
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:60932:189"/>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> too; and this is obſervable, that the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who ſo
bitterly inveighed againſt the <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Convocation-Oath,
without any ſcruple ſwallowed the <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their Solemn League
and Covenant. It's ſcarce credible, by what Severity this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
was, after the <hi>Scots</hi> Temper, impoſed upon all other ſorts of
Men, as well Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as thoſe of
the Church.</p>
                  <p>This Temper was too hot to laſt long; for about three Years
after the <hi>Independents</hi> outed the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and ſet up the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
to be true to the <hi>Rump,</hi> without King or Houſe of Lords;
nor did this Engagement laſt five Years, but was outed when
<hi>Cromwel</hi> ſet up himſelf, and impoſed the Recognition for eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf. Now let any ſhew, how in any Nation ſince the
Creation, in leſs than 13 Years time, Men ſo often ſwear and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear
Governments, which were ſo often changed, and he ſhall
be my great <hi>Apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Secluded Members, and the <hi>Rump,</hi> if you'll take their
Words, were the Repreſentatives of the People, (but without a
Head) and could not be diſſolved by the King without their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
yet <hi>O. Cromwel</hi> and his <hi>Myrmidons,</hi> without their Conſent,
diſſolved them both. And as theſe were Bodies without a Head,
ſo <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Army, (like that of the <hi>Egyptian Mamalukes)</hi>
were a Monſtrous Head without any Body of the Nation, yet
with this Difference, the <hi>Mamalukes</hi> choſe their Sultan, but
<hi>Cromwel</hi> exalted himſelf without the Army's Choice.</p>
                  <p>The firſt <hi>Manifeſto</hi> that <hi>Cromwel</hi> made known to the Nation,
was this, <hi>I</hi> Oliver Cromwel, <hi>Captain General, and Commander in
Chief of all the Armies and Forces, raiſed and to be raiſed within this
Commonwealth,</hi> &amp;c. So here <hi>Cromwel,</hi> by his own Authority,
makes the Army perpetual, having depoſed the Parliament, which
were made perpetual by Act of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>I have often admired upon what Bottom <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſtood when
he preſumed to do theſe things; for the <hi>Sectaries</hi> and <hi>Fifth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi>-Men,
who were the Creatures whom he at firſt moſt
relied upon, when they perceived his Ambition, then became
his utter Enemies; the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> hated him
for the Violences he put upon them; and the <hi>Royaliſts</hi> both
dreaded and hated him.</p>
                  <p>All Kings of <hi>England</hi> in their Coronation-Oath before, ſware
to govern by the received Laws and Conſtitutions of the Nation;
but <hi>Cromwel</hi> having ſubverted theſe, neither ſays nor ſwears by
what Laws or Rules he'll govern: and tho both in the <hi>Saxon</hi> and
<hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rman Dynaſties,</hi> the Hereditary Succeſſion of the Kings was often
changed; yet none ſucceeded which was not of the Royal Blood
(which cannot be ſaid of the <hi>Caroline</hi> and <hi>Capuſian</hi> Lines of <hi>France,</hi>
nor in the Succeſſion of the Race of the Kings of <hi>Spain)</hi> yet <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi>
                     <pb n="371" facs="tcp:60932:189"/>
without Law, or being of the Royal Blood, made himſelf
more abſolute than any of our Kings before him.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Terras</hi> (I am ſure <hi>Britannias) Aſtraea reliquit;</hi> Juſtice,
Truth and Plain-dealing is fled the Land, and Diſſimulation, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy,
Intriguing and Deſigns rove all <hi>England</hi> over, and <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
to ſupport his ill-eſtabliſh'd Greatneſs, ſets all his Agents and
Sycophants on work to congratulate and approve his Actions, and
to ſtand by and aſſiſt him. One of the firſt of theſe was from
the Officers of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (no doubt but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
by <hi>Monk</hi> in the State he ſtood then with <hi>Cromwel.)</hi> So that
as from <hi>Scotland</hi> our Civil Wars firſt began, and from thence their
ſolemn League and Covenant was ſo rigidly impoſed in <hi>England;</hi>
ſo from thence now come Congratulatory Addreſſes to <hi>Cromwel</hi> for
overturning all they had done; and a time ſhall come when a Storm
ſhall come from <hi>Scotland,</hi> which ſhall diſperſe and unravel all that
the <hi>Covenanters, Rump</hi> and <hi>Cromwel</hi> had done; thus you'll ſee
how lame-footed Vengeance ſhall overtake them all. Having ſeen
how <hi>Cromwel</hi> eſtabliſhed himſelf, we'll proceed to ſee the Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> above all things dreading the <hi>Rump,</hi> animated <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
to diſſolve them, promiſing greater things to him than they
had done to the <hi>Rump</hi> in caſe he would do it, which being done,
the <hi>Dutch</hi> (not unreaſonably) hoped by the Diſorders which
would ariſe in <hi>England</hi> by it, they ſhould be better able to deal
with <hi>Cromwel</hi> than the <hi>Rump;</hi> and, notwithſtanding their calling
God to witneſs of their ſincere Love and Affection to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Nation, and deſire of propagating the true Reformed Proteſtant
Religion, with all imaginable Diligence, ſet out a greater Fleet
to Sea than they had done before, and <hi>Trump</hi> gave out he would
fire the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships in their Harbours and the <hi>Downs</hi> before the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet ſhould get out.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Rump,</hi> who well underſtood what Faith or Credit was
to be given to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Proteſtations, were not behind-hand with
the <hi>Dutch</hi> in their Naval Preparations, which <hi>Cromwel</hi> found ready
to fight with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and ſooner than the <hi>Dutch</hi> look'd for,
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet commanded by <hi>Monk</hi> and <hi>Dean, Penn</hi> Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,
and <hi>Lawſon</hi> Rear-Admiral, upon the ſecond of <hi>June</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and at the beginning <hi>Dean</hi> was kill'd by a Cannon-Ball,
but the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſore preſſed upon by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> bore away,
and made a running Fight, having a Ship of 42 Guns ſunk by
<hi>Lawſon,</hi> and 140 Men in her; but the Winds blowing croſs, the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> could not that day do much more Execution.</p>
                  <p>Next day <hi>Monk</hi> engaged the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet again, and ſunk ſix
of their beſt Ships, two were blown up, and eleven taken, one
Vice-Admiral and two Rear-Admirals, with two of their Hoys,
and thirteen hundred and fifty Priſoners; and of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> not

                  <p>But rather than ſubmit to this Introduction of a Treaty, the
<hi>Dutch</hi> reſolve to try once again their Fortune by War, and
fit out the greateſt Fleet they could, to be again commanded by
<hi>Van Trump.</hi> Theſe were encountred by <hi>Monk,</hi> who fought them
on the <hi>29th</hi> and <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> and took and ſunk 30 of their
Men of War, whereof eight were Flag-Ships, and retook the

                  <p>In this Engagement the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had but two Ships fired, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

                  <p>Between theſe Fights, <hi>viz. July 8. Cromwel,</hi> by the Title of, <hi>I</hi>
Oliver Cromwel, <hi>Captain General, and Commander in Chief of all

144 (which was twelvefold the Number of the Tribes of

Government of the Nation. Theſe were <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Fifth-Monarchy</hi>-Men,
<hi>Cromwel</hi> believing them to be the propereſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
to do his Journey-work, but was miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>Upon the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> 120 of theſe appeared at <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
and being ſet round a Table in the Council-Chamber, <hi>Cromwel</hi> and

(this was ſuch a <hi>Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y-Show</hi> as ne're before was ſeen in fair <hi>Albion</hi>'s
Iſle) <hi>Cromwel</hi> made a Speech to them, ſhewing the Cauſe of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:60932:190"/>
their Summons, and that they had a clear Call to take upon them
the ſupream Authority of the Commonwealth, and urged divers
Places of Scripture to admoniſh them to do their Duties.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Cromwel,</hi> to manifeſt the Clearneſs of their Call, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
an Inſtrument under his own Hand and Seal, whereby he did,
with the Advice of his Officers, devolve and intruſt the ſupream
Authority and Government of this Commonwealth into the Hands
of the Perſons then met. <hi>It ſeems then the other 24 which were not
yet come up had no part of the Supream Authority and Government of
the Commonwealth,</hi> but a leſs Number may do the Work.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Cromwel</hi> then tells them, that any forty of them are to be
held and acknowledged the Supream Authority of the Nation, and
all Perſons within the ſame are to yield Obedience and Subjection.
Yet this clear Call binds them to ſit no longer than the third of
<hi>November,</hi> and that three Months before their Diſſolution they
make Choice of other Perſons to ſucceed them, who are not to ſit
longer than a Year, and to be left to them to take care for the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Government, and ſo <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Officers left them:
But he had as good ſaid nothing, for his Supream Authority ſat
longer than the third of <hi>November,</hi> yet never made choice of
other Perſons to ſucceed them, nor took any care for the Succeſſion
of the Government.</p>
                  <p>However this Thing, or Creature of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s, calls it ſelf a
Parliament; and becauſe one <hi>Praiſe God Barebone</hi> a <hi>Leatherſeller,</hi>
was a famous Member in it, 'twas called <hi>Barebone</hi>'s <hi>Parliament,</hi>
and they choſe one <hi>Rouſe</hi> their Speaker. But how Godly ſoever
<hi>Cromwel</hi> ſeem'd to appear by his divers Texts of Scripture, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving
the Supream Authority of the Nation upon theſe Men,
yet he retained the Wiſdom of the Serpent, and by his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
impoſed ſix Months Aſſeſſments upon the Nation, which
you may ſee in <hi>Baker</hi>'s Hiſtory, <hi>fol. 618. b.</hi> which <hi>Whitlock</hi> takes
no notice of; and if he had not, it's a Queſtion whether his choſen
Creatures, <hi>The Supream Authority of the Nation,</hi> would have done it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Barebone</hi>'s Parliament was ſo highly pleaſed with <hi>Monk</hi>'s Victory
over the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that they order'd a Day of Thankſgiving for it,
with a Narrative to be publickly read, and alſo ſeveral Chains of
Gold to be given to <hi>Blake</hi> (tho he was in neither of theſe Fights)
<hi>Monk, Penn</hi> and <hi>Lawſon</hi> for their good Service, and a Gratuity to
all the other Officers and Seamen according to their Quality over
and above their Pay. This is obſervable, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> himſelf
put the Chain of Gold, and the Medal with the Repreſentation of
a Sea-Fight, which <hi>Barebone</hi>'s Parliament had given <hi>Monk,</hi> about
his Neck, and having invited <hi>Monk</hi> to Dinner, made him wear it
all the while. See the <hi>Hiſtory of</hi> Monk'<hi>s Life,</hi> p. 77.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Supream Authority were thus jolly in
<hi>England,</hi> all was in Confuſion and Diſtraction in <hi>Holland</hi> (I mean
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:60932:191"/>
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Provinces) the common People obey'd no longer their
Government: The Placarts of the <hi>States General</hi> were deſpiſed,
and they in danger to be ruined and plunder'd by the ignorant and
impetuous Rabble. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors here could obtain no
other Terms of Peace than by a Coalition, Satisfaction for Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
received by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and Security for the future, that
the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould not do the like again, and that the <hi>Dutch</hi> take
a Leaſe for 21 Years for Fiſhing, and to pay an Annual Rent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Council thus reſolute, and Plenipotentiaries tried what
Terms of Peace might be had from</hi> Barebone'<hi>s Parliament:</hi> But
theſe took the <hi>Dutch</hi> to be the Outworks of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which muſt be
taken down before there could be any coming at the main Fort: They
looked upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> as Carnal and Worldly Politicians, Enemies to
the Kingdom of Chriſt, and ſuch as would upon all occaſions retard the
Progreſs of the Saints and People of God, in overturning the Powers
of this World: That Antichriſt, the Man of Sin, could never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
in <hi>Italy,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> retained any conſiderable Strength
in the <hi>United Neterlands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They did not inſiſt upon the Flag, nor Dominion of the Seas, but
held it neceſſary in order to the Coming of Chriſt, and his Perſonal
Reign, that the Seas ſhould be ſcoured and preſerved as peaceably as
the Land, that both ought jointly to ſubmit to the Power of King
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> whoſe Ways they, and not the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> were to prepare:
They allowed the Procedure of the <hi>Dutch</hi> by Petition, ſince the Power
of the Council of State was all one with that of the Saints, and
theirs derived from him to whom all Power is given: And upon that
account the <hi>Dutch</hi> ought to continue their Addreſſes of <hi>Meſeignours, &amp;
Treſilluſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>es Seignours,</hi> to the Council of State, not in the ſenſe they
are forbidden in the Goſpel, but that whereby our <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> aſſumes
ſuch Titles, and confers them on the Saints: That the Saints there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
might tolerate them, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> ought not to refuſe them, leſt
it ſhould be a Rejection of the Kingdom of Chriſt, which was now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching:
That the <hi>Dutch</hi> ought to kiſs the Son leſt he be angry, and
ſhould have a care how they contemn his Holy Ones, leſt they were cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed with the Rod of Iron. See <hi>Stubbe,</hi> p. 91, 92.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> were now more confounded and perplex'd than ever,
it was difficult to treat with, and impoſſible to prevail upon theſe
Men: They were now in danger to be ruin'd as Enemies to Chriſt,
rather than <hi>England;</hi> and a Coalition with <hi>England</hi> would not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy,
except they likewiſe annexed their Provinces unto the <hi>Fifth
Monarchy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Holland</hi> the Provinces met to conſult what to do; the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Holland</hi> was never to enter into a Coalition with <hi>England,</hi>
but that a ſtrict League defenſive ſhould be proffered; that they
ought to contract Foreign Amities, eſpecially with <hi>France,</hi> and to
equip out a Fleet with all poſſible Expedition: Yet they had little
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:60932:191"/>
reaſon to expect much Help from <hi>France,</hi> being then imbroiled in
Civil Wars; beſides, they had ſo juggled with <hi>France,</hi> and falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
their Faith ſince the Treaty at <hi>Munſter,</hi> that they had little
reaſon to expect Help from <hi>France.</hi> The other Provinces were for
entring into a League with the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> and other
<hi>German</hi> Princes, and giving Aſſiſtance to the <hi>Scots,</hi> for at this
time Major General <hi>Middleton</hi> was raiſing ſome Tumults there;
but their Neceſſities were preſent, and theſe Treaties remote and
dangerous, they could not get any great Benefit by a Treaty with
the <hi>German</hi> Princes, they having (except <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> who had
but little) no Power at Sea. Beſides, theſe Alliances would coſt
dear, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> pretended they were poor, and alſo ſuch an
Alliance would prove dangerous; for the Elector of <hi>Cologne</hi> might
demand the Reſtitution of <hi>Rhineburg, Orſoy, Rees,</hi> and other Places
which the <hi>Dutch</hi> had filch'd from that Electorate; ſo might the
Elector of <hi>Bradenburgh,</hi> of <hi>Weſel,</hi> and other Places wherein the
<hi>Dutch</hi> kept Gariſons above 40 Years; beſides, they feared the
Emperor might claim in right of the Empire; and little good could
be expected from aſſiſting the <hi>Scots,</hi> without being ſuperiour at
Sea, and ſending a Land Army, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> could not ſpare.</p>
                  <p>They therefore gave Orders to their Plenipotentiaries, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
time according as they ſaw Diſorders to encreaſe between
<hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Supream Authority; to be ample in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
concerning the Defence of the Reformed Religion, and of the
Houſhold of Faith, to reject the Coalition, to offer to enter into
a ſtrict and intimate League, but deal as tenderly as they could in
point of Reparation, Satisfaction or Security.</p>
                  <p>All theſe things were known to <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Council of State, and
they reſolved to handle them accordingly; and when theſe were
communicated to <hi>Barebone</hi>'s Parliament, they ſaid, it was no more
than was propheſied in Scripture, and in courſe to be expected,
that <hi>the Gentiles ſhould rage, and the Kings of the Earth ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt the Kingdom of Chriſt; but they ſhould fall before him,
and be broken in pieces.</hi> That they were fierce to encounter <hi>Gog</hi> and
<hi>Magog,</hi> and by a ſeries of Victories inflam'd to encounter this
<hi>Antichriſtian Hoſt.</hi> It's tedious to ſet forth the manifold Tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
recited by <hi>Stubbe</hi> and <hi>Leo ab Aitzma,</hi> who could not err here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Cant in ſecuring the true Reformed Religion,
and of their love and deſire of the Proſperity of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
                  <p>The Council of State ſince the <hi>Dutch</hi> refuſed a Coalition, and
thereby became our Equals, reſolve to make them humble with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, and therefore impoſe 27 Articles upon the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which
may be ſeen in <hi>Leo ab Aitzma,</hi> p. 837, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Stubbe</hi>
mentions but five, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>third, twelfth, fourteenth, fifteenth,</hi>
and <hi>ſeventeenth,</hi> beſides Satisfaction and Reparation made for
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:60932:192"/>
ſeveral Wrongs, Injuries, and Depredations, done and committed
upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as well in the <hi>East-Indies</hi> as elſewhere, by the
People of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> with Power nevertheleſs of the
Council, to add, alter, and enlarge the ſaid Articles, or any of
them, before the Concluſion of the Treaty, as they ſhall find oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion

                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> 3d <hi>Article was,</hi> That the Ships, Guns, and Furniture, and
the Goods and Merchandizes, and other things, which had been taken
in Harbour or at Land from the <hi>Dutch</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> during the War,
ſhould be accounted as part of Satisfaction and Reparation for the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Damages which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had been put to during the War:
And the <hi>States General</hi> ſhould pay to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuch further Sum
for Reparation as aforeſaid, and in ſuch manner as ſhall be agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> 12th <hi>Article obliges them,</hi> Not to permit the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
or the Princeſs <hi>Mary,</hi> to relieve with Counſel, or Victuals, any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
or Enemies of the Common-wealth of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> and to ſeclude
the Prince's Lineage from being State-holders, Admiral, General, or
Governour of any of their Towns. <hi>I'm perſwaded</hi> Cromwel <hi>was the

be agreed upon in this Treaty: But in caſe the <hi>States General</hi> ſhould

and obtain their Conſent before they put to Sea.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> 15th <hi>Article, wherein</hi> Stubbe <hi>follows the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript,
and not</hi> Leo ab Aitzma, <hi>which much differs from it.</hi> As the
Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> have declared their Reſolutions, that they
will from time to time take care to put forth upon their Seas a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Number of armed Ships for the Defence and Safeguard thereof,
and to maintain and preſerve all lawful Navigation, Trade, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
therein, against Pirates and Sea-Rovers, and all others that
ſhall act or do any thing to the Diſturbance thereof; ſo for the greater
freedom of Commerce and Navigation, that neither Commonwealth

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>17th</hi> Article obliges the <hi>Dutch to take a Leaſe for 21 Years
for the Fiſhing, and to pay an Annual Rent.</hi> Here note, That tho
the <hi>Dutch</hi> pleaded the Grants of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> to the Dukes
of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> for Licence to fiſh upon the
Coaſts of <hi>England,</hi> which they could no ways pretend to after they

and their immemorial Preſcription to fiſh in theſe Seas, tho Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
were then alive who were born before they became <hi>States;</hi>
yet they were not ſo impudent to plead <hi>Grotius</hi>'s <hi>Mare Liberum,</hi>
that they had as much Right to fiſh in theſe Seas, as the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>

Thus far <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Council and the <hi>Rump</hi> went in equal Paces,
and the <hi>Dutch</hi> now were in no better ſtate than when <hi>Cromwel</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
the <hi>Rump:</hi> But two Accidents, which were not in the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Power, contributed to their Deliverance from the deſperate
ſtate they were reduced to; one was <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Ambition; the other,
the Frenzy of <hi>Barebone</hi>'s <hi>Parliament:</hi> for <hi>Cromwel,</hi> however he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
the <hi>Rump</hi> of Selfiſhneſs, was himſelf much more ſelfiſh;
for without any regard to the Honour or Intereſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Nation, now makes it his Buſineſs to join in a Defenſive League
with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> againſt the King and Royal Family, to ſet up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his Poſterity. <hi>Barebone</hi>'s <hi>Parliament</hi> was contrary to <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s
Deſigns, and he knew 'twas impoſſible to alter them; and
therefore reſolv'd one way or other to be rid of them: and the
<hi>Dutch</hi> dreaded them; and therefore the <hi>Dutch</hi> Plenipotentiaries
told <hi>Cromwel,</hi> that in caſe he would depoſe them, and aſſume the
Government to himſelf, they would be ready to accord with him
upon more moderate Terms, and enter into ſuch a Defenſive Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance,
as ſhould ſecure him againſt his foreign and domeſtick
Enemies: This was the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>December.</hi> See <hi>Stubbe,</hi> p. 110.</p>
                  <p>The Frenzy of <hi>Barebone</hi>'s <hi>Parliament</hi> was as intolerable to the
Nation as to <hi>Cromwel;</hi> ſo that no Man could judg of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
or where they would end. Their Prate was, to make way
for Chriſt's Monarchy upon Earth, which they were ſure was at
hand, now they were got together: therefore they pronounced
Prieſthood to be <hi>Popery;</hi> paying of Tithes, <hi>Judaiſm;</hi> the Laws of
<hi>England, The Remains of the</hi> Roman <hi>Yoke;</hi> Schools and Colleges,
<hi>Heatheniſh Seminaries of curious and vain Learning;</hi> and Nobility
and Honour, <hi>contrary to the Law of Nature and Chriſtianity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho theſe had ſat above five Months, yet they made but four
Laws; one, <hi>for puniſhing ſeditious Sea-men,</hi> cauſed by their tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
demanding their Tun and Gun-Money taken from the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
and granted them by the <hi>Rump:</hi> another, <hi>For Marrying by Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Peace:</hi> the third, <hi>For Regiſtring Births, and not Chriſtnings:</hi>
and the fourth, was an Act brought in by <hi>Praiſe-God Barebone,
Against Building, unleſs upon old Foundations, within ten Miles of
London;</hi> tho his Son deſigns to build <hi>London</hi> all the Country over
upon new Foundations.</p>
                  <p>But tho <hi>Cromwel</hi> was reſolved to be rid of <hi>Barebone</hi>'s <hi>Parliament,</hi>
yet he would not proceed in that rude and Ruffian manner as he
did againſt the <hi>Rump,</hi> but wheedled with <hi>Rouſe</hi> the Speaker, and
ſome of his Creatures, that it ſhould be moved in the Houſe,
<hi>That their ſitting longer would not be for the Good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and that it would be fit for them to reſign up their Powers to
the Lord-General again:</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Speaker,</hi> with ſuch Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
as would follow him, went to <hi>White-hall,</hi> and under their
Hands reſigned up their Power to <hi>Cromwel.</hi> See <hi>Whitlock</hi> fol. 551.

Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> in his <hi>Elenchus,</hi> pag. 165. ſays <hi>Cromwel</hi> made a ſhew
of Wonder at it, denying utterly and rejecting it; but at length,
with much ado, was prevail'd upon. This was <hi>Decemb.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>The Copy of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Countenance was quite contrary to his
Actions; for tho he ſeemingly refuſed to accept of the Reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made by <hi>Rouſe</hi> and his Followers, yet he ſent a Party of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to purge the Houſe of thoſe who ſtay'd behind; whereof

out of the Chair when <hi>Cromwel</hi> outed the <hi>Rump.</hi> See <hi>Baker</hi>'s

                  <p>Before we proceed to ſee how <hi>Cromwel</hi> behaved himſelf after
his reſuming the Government again, it's fit to ſee how the Caſe
ſtood between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> at this time, as alſo the
<hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> in reference to this War. Tho there was no
declared War between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> yet there often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
Acts of Hoſtility between them, the <hi>French</hi> making Prize of
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships at Sea, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> much more of the <hi>French:</hi>
and upon the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1652, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the <hi>Downs</hi>
ſet upon a <hi>French</hi> Fleet laden with Proviſions and Ammunition,
under the Convoy of ſo many Men of War as the <hi>French</hi> could
well ſet out, and diſperſed the Fleet, and took ſeven of their Men
of War, whereby the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were enabled to retake <hi>Dunkirk</hi>
and <hi>Graveling,</hi> taken from them by the <hi>French</hi> in the Year 1646.
The next Year, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>October</hi> 1653, Captain <hi>Hayton</hi> in the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire,</hi>
came up to eight <hi>French</hi> Men of War, and ſhot twice at
their Admiral, who returned him a Broad-ſide, and <hi>Hayton</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to have boarded her, but ſhe got away: <hi>Hayton</hi> with his
ſingle Ship engaged the reſt, and took the <hi>French</hi> Vice-Admiral and
Rear-Admiral, and another of their Men of War, and many rich
Prizes, with the Loſs but of four Men, and ſome wounded. See
<hi>Whitlock</hi>'s <hi>Memoirs,</hi> fol. 547. <hi>b.</hi> So inconſiderable were the <hi>French</hi>
at Sea in thoſe Days.</p>
                  <p>However, the <hi>Dutch</hi> held conſtant Intelligence with the <hi>French</hi>
in all their Negotiations with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> during this War, as you
may ſee in <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s <hi>Memoirs,</hi> fol. 568. as appears by Monſieur
<hi>Chanute</hi>'s Speech to the <hi>States;</hi> wherein, in this low ſtate of the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> he gives them the Title of <hi>High Puiſſances:</hi> and when the
<hi>Dutch</hi> were in their diſtreſſed ſtate, in the time both of the <hi>Rump</hi>
and <hi>Barebone</hi>'s <hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> fearing the <hi>Dutch</hi>'s Ruin, or
ſuch a Peace as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould impoſe upon them, proffer'd
to be at half Charges with the <hi>Dutch</hi> in caſe they would continue
their War with <hi>England;</hi> otherwiſe the <hi>French</hi> were not able to
contribute but little to help them at Sea. Now let's ſee if <hi>Oliver</hi>'s
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:60932:193"/>
Government was as arrogant, impolitick, ſelfiſh, and dangerous
to the Safety of the Nation, as his firſt aſſuming it was rude and
barbarous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After the Supream Power of the Nation had been thus tumbled
from Poſt to Pillar, from</hi> Cromwel <hi>to</hi> Barebone'<hi>s</hi> Parliament, <hi>and
from them to</hi> Cromwel <hi>again; upon the</hi> 16th <hi>of</hi> December, Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
<hi>and his Officers, after ſeveral Days ſeeking of God,</hi> tho it was
reſolved on before, reſolved, That a Council of Godly, Able and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Perſons ſhould be named, conſiſting of 21, and that the <hi>Lord-General</hi>
ſhould be choſen <hi>Lord Protector (for</hi> King, <hi>good Man, he
would not be:) but le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t he ſhould go too far aſtray, tied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
up to an Inſtrument of Government, which he ſwore to in
theſe Words;</hi> I have accepted thereof, and do declare my Acceptance
thereof accordingly; and do promiſe, in the Preſence of God, That I will
not violate or infringe the Matters and Things therein contained, but
to my Power obſerve the ſame, and cauſe them to be obſerved; and
ſhall in all other things, to the best of my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, govern theſe
Nations according to the Laws, Statutes, and Cuſtoms, ſeeking their
Peace, and cauſing Juſtice and Law to be equally adminiſtred.</p>
                  <p>In the former Impreſſion I followed <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Inſtrument of
Government, as it is ſet forth by Dr. <hi>Bates;</hi> but finding this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from Mr. <hi>Whitlock,</hi> not only in the Number of the Articles,
but in the Subſtance of ſeveral of them, I ſhall now follow
Mr. <hi>Whitlock,</hi> as being of better Authority, tho not particularly
recite them all, being long; but make Remarks upon ſeveral of
them, to ſhew how inconſiſtent this Inſtrument was with <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s
Oath, and how he obſerv'd it in his future Actions.</p>
                  <p>Cromwel'<hi>s Council was</hi> Philip <hi>Lord Viſcount</hi> Liſle <hi>(now Earl of</hi>
Leiceſter) Charles Fleetwood <hi>his Son-in-law,</hi> John Lambert, <hi>Sir</hi> Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Pickering, <hi>Sir</hi> Charles Woolſley, <hi>Sir</hi> Anthony Aſhley Cooper <hi>(af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury) Edward Mountague <hi>(after Earl of</hi> Sandwich)
John Desborow <hi>(his Brother-in-law)</hi> Walter Strickland, Henry
Lawrence, William Sydenham, Philip Jones, Richard Major, Francis
Rouſe, <hi>and</hi> Philip Skipton <hi>Eſquires.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The 5th Article is,</hi> That the Protector, with the Conſent of the
major part of the Council, have Power of War and Peace. <hi>How well
he obſerved this in his Peace with the</hi> Dutch <hi>and</hi> French, <hi>and War
with</hi> Spain, <hi>will appear afterward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The 6th Article is,</hi> That the Laws ſhall not be altered, ſuſpended
or repealed, nor any new Law made, nor any Tax, Charge, or Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
laid upon the People, but by common Aſſent in Parliaments, ſave
only as is expreſſed in the <hi>30th</hi> Article. <hi>How does this Article agree
with the</hi> 27th, That a conſtant Revenue ſhall be raiſed for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
10000 Horſe and 20000 Foot in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and
<hi>Ireland;</hi> and 200000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to himſelf, beſide the Crown-Lands:
<hi>or with the</hi> 38th <hi>Article,</hi> To repeal all Laws, Statutes and
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:60932:194"/>
Ordinances, contrary to the Liberty <hi>Cromwel</hi> grants to all tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
<hi>(as he calls them)</hi> in the next preceding Articles, where he
excludes Popery and Prelacy? <hi>Or how did</hi> Cromwel <hi>obſerve this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
when he impriſoned the</hi> Royaliſts <hi>which would not give Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
for their Good Behaviour to him? and whether they did
or not, took from them the tenth part of their Eſtates, and put
them to Death by his High Court of Juſtice, as he call'd it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>8th</hi> Article is, <hi>That Parliament, after the first Day of their
Meeting, ſhall ſit five Months, and not in that time be Adjourned,
Prorogued, or Diſſolved, without their Conſent.</hi> Yet he diſſolved the
next Parliament (as he called them) within five Months after
their firſt ſitting, with their Conſent; and if they refus'd, had
his Janizaries in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> and in <hi>the Court of Requeſts,</hi> to
have forced them, as he did by the <hi>Rump,</hi> (this is true of my own
Knowledg) and declared what ſhould be Treaſon. See <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s
<hi>Memoirs,</hi> fol. 563. <hi>b.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> 34th <hi>Article is,</hi> That the Chancellor, Keeper, or Commiſſioners
of the Great Seal, the Treaſurer, Admiral, Chief Governours of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Chief Juſtices of both the Benches, ſhall
be choſen by the Approbation of Parliament; and in the Intervals of
Parliament, by the Approbation of the major part of the Council, to be
afterwards approved by Parliament. <hi>I deny any of theſe Officers
were ever choſen or approved by Parliament: if any were, it lies
upon another to prove them to be ſo choſen or approved by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus by manifold Perjuries, deepeſt Diſſimulation, Hypocriſy,
and foul Ingratitude, <hi>Cromwel</hi> waded through a Sea of Blood in
<hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and then depoſed them who had
raiſed him, for which he had murdered thouſands for but attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to do what he had done. He aſpired to the Dominion of
<hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which the <hi>Rump</hi> had conquered to his hand;
and by <hi>Monk</hi>'s Victories over the <hi>Dutch, Holland</hi> lies at his Mercy:
ſo that as <hi>Cromwel</hi> was the moſt abſolute Tyrant that ever raged in
<hi>England,</hi> ſo was he not leſs terrible to his neighbouring Nations.
And now he had it in his Power to do what he will, let's ſee how
like a Beaſt he did what he did.</p>
                  <p>Of all our neighbouring Nations, the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> were the
moſt formidable to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> being not only Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors
with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in Trade, but Contenders with them in the
Dominion of the Seas; and the <hi>French</hi> the moſt formidable and
faithleſs by Land; and of all Nations, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade to <hi>France</hi>
was the worſt, being as much to the enriching <hi>France,</hi> as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhing
<hi>England: Spain</hi> neither a neighbouring Nation to
<hi>England,</hi> except ſome part of <hi>Flanders,</hi> nor any ways formidable
to <hi>England</hi> by Sea or Land; yet of all others, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade
with <hi>Spain</hi> was the moſt beneficial and enriching to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                     <pb n="381" facs="tcp:60932:194"/>
Now let's ſee how diametrically contrary to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt
<hi>Cromwel</hi> acted in every one of theſe.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Cromwel</hi> had aſſumed the Protectorate, Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi> ſays,
he obſerved new and great State, and all Ceremonies and Reſpects
were paid to him by all ſorts of Men, as to their Prince; and
<hi>Stubbe</hi> ſays, upon the <hi>20th</hi> Notice was given to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiaries,
by <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Maſter of the Ceremonies, of his
being Protector, and how ready he was to treat with them, and
how kind he would be to them; but they muſt pay him the
ſame Honour and Reſpect which was heretofore exhibited to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings, and in their Writings and Diſcourſes give him the
Title of <hi>Highneſs,</hi> which was in Uſe before that of <hi>Majeſty;</hi> that
they not being in the Quality of Ambaſſadors, but Lords
Deputies Plenipotentiaries, muſt be uncovered in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                  <p>In this ſtate <hi>Cromwel</hi> takes the Treaty of Peace out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil's
Hands (tho it ill agreed with his Oath to the Inſtrument of
his Government) and upon the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> (but ten Days
after his aſſuming the Protectorate) by his Secretary <hi>Thurlo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi>
brought the <hi>Dutch</hi> Plenipotentiaries a Writing, wherein the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of the <hi>3d</hi> Article, demanded by the Council, was wholly
omitted; but the Claims of the <hi>East-India</hi> Merchants and others
were to be compounded. The <hi>15th</hi> Article was changed ſo, as
that neither the Dominion of the Seas was mentioned, nor their
Ships to be ſearched; but they were to ſtrike the Flag, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
their Top-ſail to any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man of War within the <hi>Britiſh</hi>
Seas: with ſeveral other Conceſſions.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Dutch</hi> Artifice, after having made ſo many Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of agreeing with <hi>Cromwel</hi> upon better Terms than they
would, if he would diſſolve the <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>Barebone</hi>'s <hi>Parliament,</hi>
appeared: for notwithſtanding <hi>Cromwel</hi> had omitted the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
demanded by the third Article, and qualified the fifteenth;
yet looking upon <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s ſtate uncertain, and that he ſtood
in as much need of them as they of him; without giving any
Anſwer, upon the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> deſired a Paſſport to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.
Now <hi>Cromwel</hi> perceived how the Plenipotentiaries had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
him, and therefore declared, <hi>That if they departed without
concluding and ſigning the Treaty, and mutually engaging to ratify it
in a certain time, he would not be obliged to it, or any part thereof.</hi>
Hereupon the Plenipotentiaries ſtaid; and <hi>Cromwel</hi> in plain
Terms told them, <hi>Without the Secluſion of the Prince of</hi> Orange
<hi>from being Stadtholder and General, no Peace was to be expected.</hi>
But if <hi>Cromwel</hi> thus juggled with his Council, the <hi>States of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Weſt-Friezland</hi> did not leſs with the <hi>States</hi> of the reſt
of the Provinces.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="382" facs="tcp:60932:195"/>
For by the <hi>9th</hi> Article of the Union at <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht, 1579, No Truce,
Peace, or War, ſhould be made without common Conſent of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
and not by the States General.</hi> Yet this Treaty was broken
by the <hi>States of Holland,</hi> when they made a Truce with the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> 1609, for twelve Years, without the Conſent of the
other Provinces, or <hi>States General:</hi> So did they at <hi>Munſter,</hi> 1648,
make a ſeparate Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> notwithſtanding ſeveral Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
with <hi>France</hi> to the contrary; which <hi>Stubbe,</hi> pag. 72, 73, 74.
cites out of <hi>Leo ab Aitzma;</hi> the reſt of the Provinces deteſting
and declaiming againſt it, as perfidious, treacherous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cromwel</hi> knew this, and the Potency of <hi>Holland</hi> above the reſt
of all the other Provinces, as alſo their Averſion to the Houſe of
<hi>Orange,</hi> and Inſtructions of the Provinces not to exclude the
Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> Hereupon <hi>Cromwel</hi> entred into a ſecret Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with <hi>Beverning</hi> (the ſame, I think, that in 1679, at <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi>
made the ſeparate Peace with the <hi>French,</hi> without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,
or the Conſent of the reſt of the <hi>States) That if the
Province of</hi> Holland <hi>would ſign a ſecret Article for to exclude the
Houſe of</hi> Orange, <hi>he would be content to proceed in the Treaty of Peace.</hi>
But <hi>Beverning</hi> pretending he had no Inſtruction therein from the
<hi>States,</hi> they had a Paſſport to return to <hi>Holland, January</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſtay'd longer before their Return than <hi>Cromwel</hi> expected,
which put him in a great Wrath and Confuſion, and ſeem'd to
make great Preparations for carrying on the War. The <hi>Dutch,</hi> to
amuſe him, ſend over the ſame Men in a ſplendid and formal Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy,
with Conſent to all the other Articles, except the Secluſion
of the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> which <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſigned upon the <hi>5th</hi> of
<hi>April</hi> 1654, and Peace was thereupon proclaimed at <hi>London:</hi> but
<hi>Cromwel</hi> would not exchange the Ratifications, unleſs the <hi>States
of Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Friezland</hi> would make a Decree for excluding
the Houſe of <hi>Orange</hi> from being Stadtholders and General; which
the ſaid <hi>States</hi> did upon the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1654, in theſe Words,
<hi>That the Noble and Potent</hi> States of Holland <hi>and</hi> Weſt-Friezland,
<hi>would never elect his preſent Highneſs, or any of his Lineage, to be
Stadtholder, or Admiral of their Province; neither ſhould their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
ever give their Suffrage or Conſent, that he, or any of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſhould be Captain-General of the Forces of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces;</hi>
the reſt of the Provinces proteſting and declaiming againſt this, as
much as they did againſt the <hi>States of Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Friezland</hi>
for making a ſeparate Peace at <hi>Munſter,</hi> without the Conſent of
the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
                  <p>By this it's evident, That Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> in his Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> pag. 115. is miſtaken; where he
ſays, That the Union of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> was never broken before the Year
1668, when the <hi>States General</hi> (and not of <hi>Holland</hi> alone) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
the Peace of <hi>Aix la Chapelle.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="383" facs="tcp:60932:195"/>
Here you ſee how ſelfiſh <hi>Cromwel</hi> was, and how little he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
the Honour and Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> in this Peace; for he
not only remitted the 300000 <hi>l.</hi> which the <hi>Dutch</hi> proffered the
<hi>Rump</hi> for the Damages the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuſtained by the War (See
<hi>Stubbe, p.</hi> 112. in the Margin) but left out the Coalition; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
to be Annually paid to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for Liberty to fiſh in the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas; the Soveraignty of the Seas, except the Flag; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
from the <hi>Dutch</hi> not to moleſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in time to come;
and to have their Ships ſearcht in paſſing through the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas;
and not to ſet out any greater than ſuch a Number of Ships of
War, without giving an Account to the <hi>Engliſh State</hi> of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
and alſo, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould have a Free Trade up the
<hi>Scheld:</hi> and becauſe both the <hi>Rump,</hi> Council and <hi>Oliver</hi> himſelf
had demanded Juſtice againſt thoſe that were alive, who had any
Hand in the Maſſacre of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Amboyna; Cromwel</hi> ſuffered
himſelf to be deluded by the <hi>Dutch</hi> in referring it to 8 Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
and if they agreed not in 6 Months time, Umpires were to
be choſen. See <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s <hi>Memoirs, f. 568. b.</hi> But no Agreement
was made, and <hi>Cromwel</hi> never further minded it. And this is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,
that notwithſtanding both the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
of calling God the Searcher of all Hearts to witneſs, how
much by this Peace they deſigned the Glory of God, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of the true Reformed Religion abroad; yet there is not
one Article concerning the ſame, nor any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prince named
in it, except the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who was to pay the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Merchants their Damages for the Embargo he had laid upon their
Ships in the <hi>Sound.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Gumble</hi> ſays, <hi>p. 74. That</hi> Monk <hi>did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
highly reſent this Peace as a baſe Treachery in</hi> Cromwel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mazarine</hi> endeavoured to have had the <hi>French</hi> included in this
Treaty, but the <hi>States of Holland</hi> regarded him not more than
in that of <hi>Munſter.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> by this Peace had an Opportunity
to build more and greater Men of War, than they could if the
War had continued, of which you'll hear more about 10 Years
hence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mazarine</hi> finding himſelf thus neglected by the <hi>Dutch</hi> in their
Treaty of Peace with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſends <hi>Monſieur Burdeaux</hi> Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Ambaſſadour to <hi>Cromwel</hi> to obtain a Peace with him;
and was not ſo ſqueamy in excluding the King and Royal Family
out of <hi>France,</hi> as the <hi>Dutch</hi> were in excluding the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi>
but as preparatory to it, proffered to exclude the King out of
<hi>Paris</hi> (I think <hi>France)</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Whitelock</hi>'s <hi>Memoirs, f.
565.</hi> But this did not procure a Peace till the Year 1655.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Monk</hi>'s Triumphant Victories over the <hi>Dutch, Cromwel</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no further Uſe of him at Sea, ſent him back to govern <hi>Scotland;</hi>
but when he ſhall come there, <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſhall never get him out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
nor ſhall he come out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but utterly to exclude
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:60932:196"/>
                     <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Poſterity from ever mounting to his ill gotten Greatneſs;
and to unravel all that the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Parliament, the <hi>Rump</hi> and
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> had been near twenty Years in Weaving. But in regard
General <hi>Monk</hi> hath born ſo great a Figure in this Treatiſe, and

Caſe ſtood with him, before he entred into the Parliament Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                  <p>He was the ſecond of Three Sons to Sir <hi>Thomas Monk</hi> of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge</hi>
in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and born in the Year 1608. And being a
younger Brother, and having a Mind above his Fortunes, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to advance them by a Military Profeſſion. His Birth ſorted
with his Deſires, his Family being of great Antiquity, and he no
ſtranger to the Royal Blood, one of his Maternal Anceſtors being
a Daughter (but not Legitimate) of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth.</p>
                  <p>At the Age of Seventeen Years he ſerved King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt
in the unfortunate Expedition to <hi>Cadiz:</hi> And at the Age of Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
he ſerved in the more unfortunate Expedition to the Iſle of
<hi>Rhee;</hi> yet was not his Courage daunted by theſe Misfortunes, but
he followed the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> (General of the <hi>Engliſh)</hi> in the
<hi>Low-Country</hi> Wars againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> until the Civil Wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to break out in <hi>England,</hi> between the King and Parliament:
And the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion firſt breaking out, he took a Commiſſion
from the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> (agreed to be Lieutenant in <hi>Ireland</hi> by
the King and Parliament) againſt the <hi>Iriſh:</hi> But the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
after falling out, the King ſent the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Monk</hi> took a Commiſſion from him to ſerve
againſt the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Scots</hi> came with an Army into <hi>England</hi> to aſſiſt the
Parliament, the King made a Ceſſation of Arms with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi>
and recalled the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſent to ſubdue the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to aſſiſt him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots;</hi> theſe, in which <hi>Monk</hi>'s Regiment was
included, were utterly defeated by Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> joined with
Sir <hi>William Brereton, Gell, Middleton</hi> and <hi>Mitton,</hi> and <hi>Monk</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Priſoner, and ſent to the <hi>Tower;</hi> where he continued near 4
Years.</p>
                  <p>In this time he fell into great Poverty and Want, but was relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by a near Kinſman of mine, Sir <hi>R. C.</hi> then a Priſoner in the
<hi>Tower</hi> with him, and whilſt he was a Priſoner, did conform to the
Prayers and Liturgy of the Church.</p>
                  <p>When the Parliament made the ſelf-denying Ordinance, thereby
to depoſe the Earls of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Mancheſter</hi> from their Commands,
as being more inclined to a Pacification with the King, than the
Parliament were willing they ſhould be; <hi>Cromwel</hi> (knowing the
Worth of <hi>Monk)</hi> ſent to him to take a Command in the Army, to
be new modelled under <hi>Fairfax</hi> and him, which <hi>Monk</hi> accepted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="385" facs="tcp:60932:196"/>
The Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> (who was Priſoner in the <hi>Tower</hi> with <hi>Monk)</hi>
told me, that after he had accepted a Commiſſion, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed
from his Impriſonment, <hi>Monk,</hi> before he went out of the
<hi>Tower,</hi> went to viſit the Biſhop, and beg his Bleſſing, which after
the Biſhop had given him, he ſaid, <hi>Now Colonel you have changed
Sides, we expect neither to ſee, nor hear from you more;</hi> the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
then proteſted, <hi>He would never wear a Sword againſt the
King.</hi> It ſeems he did not think Fighting againſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi>
was wearing a Sword againſt the King; for he did not only wear,
but draw his Sword againſt them: And tho he changed Sides, he
did not his good Nature to Sir <hi>R. C.</hi> For on the firſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
after he came out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> he took a Journey into the
Country to viſit Sir <hi>R. C.</hi> (who was releaſed out of the <hi>Tower</hi> a
little before) and to thank him for his Favours when they were
Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But leſt</hi> Cromwel'<hi>s aſſuming the Supreme Authority of the
Nation ſhould too much ſavour of Selfiſhneſs, he having no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
but from himſelf, therefore he ſummons a Company of
Men, ſo many to be choſen by each County, but not of like Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and others to be choſen by ſuch Towns as he named, to
meet the</hi> 3d <hi>of</hi> September 1654 <hi>at</hi> Weſtminſter. <hi>He upon their
Meeting, and before he permitted them to enter the Houſe, told
them,</hi> That ſome Years ago, none would have thought of ſuch a Door of
Hope: That he knew there were yet many Humours and Intereſts, and
that Humours were above Intereſts: That the Condition of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
was like <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs: That this was an Healing-Day:
There was neither Nobleman, Gentleman nor Yeoman before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
known by any Diſtinctions: We had not any that bore Rule or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
but a great Contempt of Magiſtracy and Chriſt's Ordinance:
That the <hi>Fifth Monarchy</hi> was highly cry'd up by Perſons who would
aſſume the Government; but that deſired thing wanted greater Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
than appeared, for ſuch Men to change the Authority by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
He deſired this Aſſembly to remedy all theſe Diſorders; ſhewed, That
the Wars with <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>France (for yet he had not made
Peace with it)</hi> do, and did eat up all the Aſſeſſments: That
Swarms of <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are crept in to make Diviſions, which were grown
ſo wide, that nothing but Government could remedy them: And let
Men ſpeak what they would, he could ſpeak it with Comfort before a
greater than any of them. <hi>Then he ſhewed what he had done du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Government:</hi> Firſt, his Endeavours to reform the Laws;
next, his filling the Benches with the ableſt Lawyers; then his Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> and his Darling Ordinance for the Approbation
of Miniſters <hi>(which hindred all that liſt from invading the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry)</hi>
by Men of both Perſwaſions, <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi>
&amp;c. And laſtly, his being inſtrumental in calling a <hi>Free Parliament;</hi>
which he valued, and would keep it ſo above his Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:60932:197"/>
But this Cant did little edify the greater part of the Members,
who again chuſe <hi>Lenthal</hi> Speaker, and fall upon a ſtrict Enquiry
into <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Inſtrument of Government, which the Officer-Members
oppoſe, alledging, That the Inſtrument was the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Government by which they met; and therefore could
not be brought into Debate: And <hi>Lambert</hi> ſaid, <hi>If the Parliament
would not confirm them, they would call another, a Third and Fourth,
till 'twas done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet this frighted not the Republican Party, who boldly ſaid,</hi>
That the Government was uſurped by Fraud and Force, not procured by
Right, nor confirmed by the free Votes of the People: that it laid
Snares for the Liberty of the Common-wealth, and made way for a moſt
grievous Tyranny. <hi>Nay, one ſaid,</hi> Since we were ſo near approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Monarchy, it were better to call one of the Royal Family to the
Government, than that <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſhould uſurp both Scepter and Crown.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Debates nettled <hi>Cromwel</hi> to the quick, ſo that in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
Heat he tells them theſe Debates would turn all things into
Confuſion, and make them to return to their former Chaos: And
that they were to build upon the Foundation of the Inſtrument,
not to overturn it; with a great deal more of ſuch Stuff.</p>
                  <p>But if Admonition would not prevail, he'll try what may be
done by Force; ſo next Day he ſet a Guard upon the Houſe, who
would let no Member enter, but he who ſubſcribed a Recognition,
<hi>To be faithful to the</hi> Protector, <hi>and not to endeavour to change the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of a ſingle Perſon:</hi> When many of the <hi>Republican</hi> Party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing,
the <hi>Cromwellian</hi> Faction within Doors, became near equal
to the <hi>Republican.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecluded <hi>Republicans,</hi> rather exaſperated than ſubdued by
<hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Repulſe, join with a <hi>Republican</hi> Party of the Army, who
conſult how they might apprehend <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and bring him to a
Trial before the Parliament for his Treaſons againſt the Common-wealth:
But <hi>Cromwel</hi> being quick-ſcented, ſmelt out this Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
and ſo prevented it; and upon the <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1654,
diſſolved the Parliament, tho they ſat not 5 Months, which he
ſware by his Inſtrument of Government.</p>
                  <p>As the <hi>Republicans</hi> were impatient under <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Government,
ſo were the <hi>Royaliſts:</hi> For in <hi>March,</hi> after <hi>Cromwel</hi> had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
his Parliament, the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> deſigned to riſe, but could
not get together; yet Sir <hi>Joſeph Wagſtaff</hi> with a Body of <hi>Wiltſhire</hi>
Men, when the Aſſizes were holden at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> ſeize upon the
Judges in the Circuit, and proclaim the King, but were ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
by Captain <hi>Crook,</hi> who granted Colonel <hi>Penruddock,</hi> and
thoſe with him, Articles of War upon his ſurrendring himſelf,
to be indemnified in their Lives and Eſtates. But <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſent
other Judges, who condemned Colonel <hi>Penruddock</hi> and Captain
<hi>Groves</hi> for High Treaſon, for which they loſt their Heads; and
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:60932:197"/>
ſeveral others were hanged and quartered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cromwel</hi> being thus at Odds with his Parliament, and his ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Army in ſuch inteſtine Feuds, and Supernumeraries of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhier'd
Armies commanded by <hi>Eſſex, Mancheſter, Waller, Maſſey,
&amp;c.</hi> diſcontented, now contrives how to get freed from the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
he apprehended from them; and therefore, with as much
Selfiſhneſs, and Diſhonour and Loſs to the Nation, as by his Peace
with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> he, without Cauſe ſhewn, makes War upon <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s War with <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who ſince the Peace
of <hi>Munſter</hi> 1648, became Competitors with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade, are now ſole Proprietors of it, as much to their
Inriching as our Impoveriſhing; whereby they not only redeemed
the Loſſes they ſuſtained in the War with us, but were enabled to
build more and much greater Men of War than they had before.
And of this you'l hear more about 10 Years hence.</p>
                  <p>But theſe were not all the Loſſes which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuſtained
by this War, for <hi>Cromwel</hi> did not begin it as juſt Princes do, by
complaining of Injuries done, and demanding Redreſs, and in
caſe of denial to proclaim War; but ſneakingly, and like a Pirate,
fits up a Fleet under <hi>William Penn,</hi> (own Father to the now <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Penn)</hi> and puts on board a Land-Army, commanded by
Colonel <hi>Venables:</hi> Thus ſhipp'd, away they ſail for <hi>Hiſpaniola;</hi>
the Deſign was to take <hi>Sancto Domingo,</hi> and after <hi>Carthagena,</hi> where
they were ſure was Gold enough; but care was taken the Souldiers
and Sea-men ſhould have little enough.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Engliſh</hi> arrived at <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> ſome Souldiers were
landed in ſight of <hi>Sancto Domingo,</hi> whilſt they were to fetch
a Compaſs, and land to attack the Town on the other ſide;
but theſe miſtaking their Place of landing, landed ten Miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond:
The Sun was ſcorching, the Country uncouth, ſandy and
woody; and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ignorant of the Way, were ſo overcome
with Heat and Thirſt, that many of them died outright; others
ſo ſpent, as they could not march, ſo were killed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
without fighting: Yet ſome few feebly arrived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to join their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
when, to the breaking of all their Hearts, they opened
their Commiſſion, and found, that upon Pain of Death, <hi>All the
Gold, Silver and Rich Goods, ſhould be brought into a Common Treaſury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was cold Comfort to theſe wretched Men in this ſcorching
Climate, where they could no longer ſtay; ſo away they ſail to
<hi>Jamaica,</hi> where a Plague overtook them, ſo that in leſs than ſix
Months time, not two Hundred of this whole Army outlived it.
Thus you ſee how Divine Vengeance overtook this part of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
Abroad, after their Perfidiouſneſs, Treachery and Hypocriſy at
home: And this Calamity was brought upon them by him whom
they had ſet up to enable him to do it. And <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Mountains of Gold, (like Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> in King <hi>James</hi>
                     <pb n="388" facs="tcp:60932:198"/>
the Firſt's Reign, by his Expedition to <hi>Guiana)</hi> contracted ſuch a
Debt by this Expedition, that by all his Tricks he could never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
overcome: And as Sir <hi>Walter</hi> loſt his Head by his Expedition,
ſo did <hi>Cromwel</hi> his Reputation.</p>
                  <p>But if <hi>Cromwel</hi> loſt by this War, the Nation and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
loſt much more; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeize and confiſcate
all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Effects in <hi>Spain;</hi> which were ſo much more, by
how much the Merchants were ſurprized in it, they having no
Notice of it, by which they might have withdrawn their Effects
in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Power: and the Privateers from <hi>Dunkirk, Oſtend,</hi>
and the Ports of <hi>Biſcay</hi> and <hi>Galicia,</hi> did the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants
in all their Trades more Damage than they ſuſtained in the <hi>Dutch</hi>
War; with this Difference, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> took above ſeventeen
Hundred Prizes from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which eaſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Charge in
the War againſt the <hi>Dutch;</hi> whereas in this the <hi>Engliſh</hi> took none,
or but very few from the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor had the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation any Benefit of the Two Ships taken
by <hi>Blake</hi> in <hi>September</hi> 1656 off the Coaſt of <hi>Spain;</hi> where one
was ſunk, another burnt, and two broke to pieces on the Shoar; ſo
that of eight Plate Ships, but two got into <hi>Cadiz:</hi> On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> ſuffered by <hi>Blake</hi>'s burning the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plate-Fleet in <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> in <hi>April 1657;</hi> whereby, tho
it were the immediate Loſs of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> yet in Conſequence
this was a Loſs to <hi>Europe</hi> in all their Trades to <hi>Spain,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſo much leſſened by this Loſs, as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had thereby
leſs means to hold Trade and Commerce with the Nations who
traded to <hi>Spain,</hi> or any of its Dominions.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have ſeen <hi>Cromwel</hi> make Peace with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to the
endangering the Safety of the Nation, and War with <hi>Spain,</hi> to
the enriching the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to the impoveriſhing the <hi>Engliſh;</hi>
next you'll ſee him make Peace with <hi>France,</hi> not only to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhing
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but to the endangering the Safety, not of
<hi>England</hi> only, but of all <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that we may take a better View of what followed, it's fit
to look back, and ſee how things ſtood before.</p>
                  <p>About the latter end of 1642, Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> died; and in
<hi>May</hi> following, <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth died, his Son, the now
<hi>French</hi> King, being in the fifth Year of his Age: But Cardinal
<hi>Mazarine</hi> ſucceeding <hi>Richlieu</hi> in being Prime Miniſter of State,
not yet being warm in his Office, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
the Nobility of <hi>France</hi> roſe in Arms againſt him; and to them
the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> joined, and proſcribed <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and ſet
a Reward upon any who ſhould bring his Head.</p>
                  <p>However the Queen Mother continued firm to <hi>Mazarine;</hi> and
it was the Felicity of <hi>Mazarine</hi> to force the Paſs (I think) at
<hi>Charenton,</hi> which <hi>Conde</hi> had ordered Marſhal <hi>Tureen</hi> to keep. <hi>Conde</hi>
                     <pb n="389" facs="tcp:60932:198"/>
chafed at this Loſs, which was the loſs of <hi>Paris,</hi> receives <hi>Tureen</hi>
with Indignation and Reproach: <hi>Mazarine</hi> takes the Advantage of
this, and wins <hi>Tureen</hi> to his ſide, which made <hi>Conde</hi> betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> from whence he ſent to the <hi>Rump</hi> for Aſſiſtance;
but the <hi>Rump</hi> being reſolv'd upon a War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> gave the
Prince no Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>After the Reduction of <hi>Paris,</hi> all <hi>France</hi> in a ſhort time was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to the King's Obedience; yet the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Spirit could not bend to ſubmit to the Cardinal, but ſerved the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> when in the Year (I think) 1653,
he deſtroy'd and took half the <hi>French</hi> Army which beſieged <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenciennes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe Commotions, tho the <hi>French</hi> in the Year 1646, took
<hi>Dunkirk</hi> and <hi>Graveling</hi> from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> yet in the Year 1652,
the <hi>Spaniard</hi> retook them both from the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniard</hi>
was enabled to do this by the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for tho the <hi>Rump</hi> could not
or would not aſſiſt the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> in <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> yet having a
Squadron of Men of War in the <hi>Downs,</hi> when a great <hi>French</hi>
Fleet under a Convoy of Men of War were going to relieve <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk</hi>
(beſieged by the <hi>Spaniards)</hi> theſe were ſet upon by the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the whole <hi>French</hi> Fleet deſtroy'd or ſcatter'd, and ſo
<hi>Dunkirk</hi> ſoon after ſurrendred, as did <hi>Mardike</hi> and <hi>Graveling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor were the <hi>Spaniards</hi> leſs ſucceſsful in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> for having
expell'd the <hi>French</hi> out of it, in the Year 1652, they reduced <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona</hi>
(the Metropolis of that Province, and one of the beſt Ports
in all <hi>Spain:)</hi> but theſe Succeſſes will not long continue; and if
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were beholden to the <hi>Rump</hi> for reducing <hi>Dunkirk</hi>
and <hi>Graveling,</hi> they may aſcribe the loſs of them, and of many
more Towns and Dominions, to <hi>Cromwel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In our Trades to <hi>Spain,</hi> we were as much Gainers by them, as
Loſers by the <hi>French,</hi> ſo as we could better ſuſtain the Loſſes
wherein we debauched our ſelves by drinking <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wines:
whereas in this War with <hi>Spain,</hi> and Peace with <hi>France,</hi> we doubly
debauched our ſelves in drinking <hi>French</hi> Wines, which became ſo
much more, as <hi>Spaniſh</hi> could not be had.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, except in the buſineſs of
<hi>Rochel,</hi> were only Lookers on, whilſt this French King's Father
rooted out the Power of the Reformed in <hi>France,</hi> expell'd the
Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> out of his Country, ſupported <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia</hi>
in their Rebellion againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> tam'd the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
and took <hi>Pignerol,</hi> (the Key of his Country) and other Places
from him, as alſo <hi>Briſac</hi> from the Empire, and <hi>Landreſhy</hi> and other
Places from the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Whereas <hi>Cromwel</hi> actually joined with
the <hi>French</hi> in an offenſive War againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> whereby he
firſt made the <hi>French</hi> ſo formidable, that it's a Queſtion, whether
it be in the Power of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> to reſtrain his boundleſs Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:60932:199"/>
by Land; for beſides the routing of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army near
<hi>Dunkirk</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> or rather by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>French,</hi> they took from the <hi>Spaniard, Winixburgh, Furnes,
Bourbock, Dunkirk, Mardike, Graveling, Montmeily, Ipre,</hi> and other
Places.</p>
                  <p>But the Land could put no Bounds to the <hi>French</hi> Ambition, and
therefore <hi>Mazarine</hi> made uſe of this Conjuncture to enlarge the
<hi>French</hi> Dominion by Sea, without which all the <hi>French</hi> Grandure
by Land could not protect <hi>France</hi> from the Inſults and Invaſions
which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> might make upon it by Sea: And
herein <hi>Mazarine</hi> wiſely conſidered, that the Dominion of the Sea
could not be attained but by Navigation, nor could Navigation be
had but by Trade to ſupport it.</p>
                  <p>Of all Trades the Fiſhing-Trade moſt increaſes Navigation both
my Mariners and Ships. For in other Trades by Navigation, as to
<hi>Turkey, Miſcovy,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> it may be we imploy a
thouſand Men in making Cloths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ten Mariners in the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Vent of them; whereas in the Fiſhing Trade every Man
becomes a Mariner: Add hereunto, in the Fiſhing Trade the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
are always at hand for the Publick Service of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and luſty, active and ſtrong; whereas in the long Sea Voyages,
eſpecially to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> the Mariners are long abſent, and
in the Diverſities of Climates, and by ſalt Meats and ſowr Drinks
become ſubject to infinite Diſtempers: ſo that it may be a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
Whether in theſe Voyages, we do not loſe more Men than
make Mariners? And of thoſe which ſurvive, one Fiſherman
ſhall by his Health and Strength beat three of them.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, in our Foreign Trades by Navigation, we employ only
Men in them, whereas in the Fiſhing Trade, we employ all ſorts
of People, Men, Women and Children, in curing and drying
Fiſh, and in making Cordage, Nets and Sails for the Fiſhing-Trade.
The Fiſhing-Trade upon the Coaſt of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the <hi>French</hi> could not hope to drive the <hi>Dutch</hi> out of; but
the <hi>New-found-land</hi> Fiſhery was too remote from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and
the <hi>French</hi> ſhould only have the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to conteſt with in it.</p>
                  <p>Here let's ſee how the Caſe ſtood between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>French</hi> in this Conteſt. The <hi>New-found-land</hi> Fiſhery was carried
on by the Inhabitants of the Port-Towns of <hi>Cornwal, Devon</hi> and
<hi>Dorſetſhire:</hi> theſe Ports were all Corporations, which excluded all
other Men from carrying on this Trade; and theſe Corporation-Men
being few and Beggars, could not enlarge their Fiſhing-Trade
beyound their Men and Stock.</p>
                  <p>Whereas <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> St. <hi>Malo's, Morlaix, Breſt, Blavet,
Rochford, Bayon,</hi> and other <hi>Weſtern</hi> Ports of <hi>France,</hi> are not only
manifoldly bigger and better peopled than the Ports of the Weſtern
and Southern Parts of <hi>England,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> King contributed
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:60932:199"/>
three hundred thouſand Piſtols for carrying on the <hi>New-found-land</hi>
Fiſhery; and for further Encouragement, gave half Pay to
luſty young Men above their Wages for two or three Voyages,
for the increaſe of Mariners; and in all the Ports of <hi>France</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
Schools for inſtructing Youth in Mathematical Learning
<hi>gratis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fiſh caught in the <hi>New-found-land</hi> Fiſhery coſt nothing but
the catching and curing, ſo that they who can catch and cure them
cheapeſt, are ſure of a Foreign Market in their vending: And
this creates another Navigation and Employment of Mariners.
And here let's ſee if the Act of Navigation be not as much a
Cauſe of enabling the <hi>French</hi> in carrying on this Fiſhery, as it is
eternally of fixing the Fiſhing-Trade upon the Coaſt of <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Green-land</hi> Trade, upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> have upon the Coaſt of <hi>France</hi> (I dare ſay) near
twenty-fold more Timber to build Veſſels for the <hi>New-found-land</hi>
Fiſhery, than can be had at like diſtance from the Ports of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal,
Devon</hi> and <hi>Dorſet;</hi> and, I believe, as cheap as the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
pay for the Carriage of theirs to the Ports: and when it comes
there, the <hi>French</hi> Timber is wrought much eaſier than the <hi>Engliſh;</hi>
and Veſſels made of <hi>French</hi> Timber draw leſs Water, and are ſailed
with fewer Hands: Beſides, the <hi>French</hi> encourage all Foreigners
to build their Veſſels more conveniently for this Trade, than the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> underſtand.</p>
                  <p>And as the <hi>French</hi> have much more manifoldly the Advantage
above the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in building Ships, ſo have they more in Plenty of
Hemp and Flax for fitting up Ships for this Trade (wherein, I
ſuppoſe, they do not reſtrain the <hi>French</hi> from curing Flax and
Hemp in ſtanding Waters) and in Proportion as much cheaper
than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> can fetch Foreign Hemp and Flax in <hi>Engliſh</hi>-built
Ships, and ſailed by <hi>three fourths Engliſh:</hi> So that to the Poverty
of theſe beggarly Corporations, this wiſe Law of Navigation ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to encounter the <hi>French</hi> in the <hi>New-found-land</hi>
Fiſhery, in Ships doubly as dear built, and ſailed by near double
the Charge, and ſo as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are like to come to a ſorry Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
abroad, if they can find none at home, for their Fiſh caught
in this Trade.</p>
                  <p>Add hereunto, that the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who cannot cure a White Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
Pilchard, or Cod-fiſh, are too wiſe to be inſtructed in this
Trade, but keep the Fiſh on Board till it becomes ſtale, and ſo
cannot be ſo well cured as when new caught; whereas the <hi>French</hi>
cure them on board; ſo, as they take them cheaper, ſo they cure
them better: The Succeſs hereof you will hear more hereafter.
So that from the Act of Navigation made by the <hi>Rump,</hi> and this
War by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> we may date the Fall or Decay of the beneficial
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:60932:200"/>
Trades of <hi>England,</hi> and alſo of the Value of the Lands of <hi>England,</hi>
being a neceſſary Conſequence.</p>
                  <p>Having ſeen <hi>Cromwel</hi> lay a Foundation for the Ruin not of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
only, but of the Weſtern Dominions of <hi>Europe</hi> abroad, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting
the <hi>French</hi> Grandure by Sea and Land; we'll ſee how he
behav'd himſelf at home, and how he eſtabliſhed his ill acquired
Dominion in himſelf and Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>He ſet up fourteen Major-Generals over <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi>
with an abſolute Power to enquire after all thoſe who had bore
Arms, or been ſequeſtred for being Malignants, and to make them
pay the tenth part of their Eſtates, and to be impriſoned till they
gave Security for their Good Behaviour to <hi>Cromwel.</hi> Theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-Generals
acted their Parts to the Life; and being an obſcure
company of mean Fellows (except <hi>Fleetwood)</hi> lorded it over
the Nobility as well as Gentry and Clergy, with an unheard-of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence.
Here I take liberty to tell, it may be, a not unpleaſing
Story.</p>
                  <p>My Father was a Member of the Long Parliament, and one of
the firſt Rate which was expell'd the Houſe, ſequeſtred and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
for Malignancy, firſt at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> after at <hi>London:</hi> And
whilſt he was a Priſoner there, the Committee at <hi>Haberdaſhers-Hall</hi>
ſent a Meſſenger to him, to pay 300 <hi>l.</hi> for the five and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
part of his Eſtate, for being reſident in <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Father was not forward to return an Anſwer, till the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
told him he muſt have an Anſwer: Then my Father told
him, that ſuch Reſidence as he had in <hi>London,</hi> he wiſhed to thoſe
who ſent him. Afterward Sir <hi>Anthony Weldon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> (Chair-man to the
Committee in <hi>Kent)</hi> ſent to him, that if he would ſend the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
his Court-Rolls, they would keep his Courts for him;
to which my Father anſwered, the Parliament had kept him Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
near three Years to prove him a Knave, but Sir <hi>Anthony</hi>
ſhould not beg him for a Fool.</p>
                  <p>My Father would never own the Parliament's Power, by peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
them, or paying any Taxes aſſeſſed by them; yet by
the Solicitation of my Mother, he was diſcharged of his Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
and Impriſonment.</p>
                  <p>Of all the Provinces of theſe Major-Generals, <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s was
the greateſt, being the Aſſociated Counties, which were <hi>Norfolk,
Suffolk, Eſſex, Cambridgſhire, Huntingdonſhire,</hi> and (I think) <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not remember <hi>Fleetwood</hi> ever acted of himſelf, but one
<hi>Haynes</hi> was his Deputy: But becauſe theſe Major-Generals were
Men of Action, and ſo could not always attend this Buſineſs, they
appointed Committees of their own Gang, mean and profligate
Fellows, who ſhould not vary one Tittle from their Inſtructions:
One <hi>Day</hi> an Attorney was Chair-man to tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </p>

                     <pb n="393" facs="tcp:60932:200"/>
In the Year 1656, one Major <hi>Rolſton</hi> (who ſerved under
Sir <hi>Richard Willis,</hi> when he was Governor of <hi>Newark</hi> for the King,
and who betray'd the Cavaliers Deſigns to <hi>Cromwel)</hi> came to me
and told me, the King was making great Preparations to land in
<hi>England,</hi> and that the Cavaliers were intending to riſe all over
<hi>England</hi> to aſſiſt him: This he aſſured me he had from Sir <hi>Richard
Willis,</hi> and told me I could not do the King greater Service, than
to provide ſome Horſe-Arms, Back, Breaſt, Pot and Piſtols.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon I went to <hi>London,</hi> and bought a Dozen of either, and
had them put up in two Hampers, and ſee them put on Ship-board,
and then returned into the Country, and took care upon the firſt
Arrival of the Ship to have notice of it: And when the Ship ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived,
I ordered the Buſineſs ſo, that in the Night I got them to
my Father's Houſe; this was upon a <hi>Friday;</hi> and that Night my
youngeſt Brother and I ſo diſpoſed of them, that I believe none
but we two knew where.</p>
                  <p>Upon <hi>Sunday,</hi> about Midnight, my Father's Houſe was broke into
by a Party of Horſe-Men ſent from <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and the Cellars, and
all ſuſpected places of the Houſe were ſearched for Arms, but
none found, but the Swords of me and my Brother, which hung
up in the Hall, which they carried away as well as my Father and
Brother: My Father was old, very fat and unweildy, my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
young, (about nineteen Years old) raw, and of little Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in Martial or any other Affairs; but whither they were
carried we could not tell.</p>
                  <p>The News of this Exploit was ſoon blazed all the Country over,
and this brought me a Ticket to meet <hi>Rolſton,</hi> and a Couſin Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of mine at a certain Place, for we had our Meeting-places.</p>
                  <p>We met with heavy Countenances, not one of us but expected to
be hanged, tho I had more reaſon to fear it than either of them:
The danger was, my Brother would diſcover all, they both wiſhed
I had been taken, ſo my Brother had not: I thanked them for their
good Wiſhes, but this availed nothing; what was to be done now
my Brother was a Priſoner, was to be adviſed of, they both could
not tell what to do, but hanging was the beſt we could expect.</p>
                  <p>At laſt I told them that theſe Fellows were <hi>Sancho Pancho</hi>'s
Stamp, <hi>Proud to the Humble, and Humble to the Proud,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
nothing was to be done with them but by Hectoring: they
both agreed, but neither of them would undertake it, but left it
to me.</p>
                  <p>The next day News came from my Father from <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> for
Drink and Diet; for he ſaid this Devil could be caſt out no other
way than by Faſting; and therefore would neither pay for any
Meat or Drink which was ſold there, nor give the Souldiers one
Penny who guarded him: And by this time I got ſome ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
that my Brother had diſcovered our Deſign of riſing to a
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:60932:201"/>
mean Fellow, whoſe Mother <hi>Hopkins</hi> the Witch-finder had been
hanged for a Witch, who had informed one of the <hi>Breſters,</hi> of
which there were three Brothers, <hi>Robert, Francis,</hi> and <hi>Humphry,</hi>
(all ſtiff <hi>Cromwelians)</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>The next Day I went to <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> where I found my Father
and Brother at Variance, for they were not at good Terms one
with the other, and Soldiers guarding them. At firſt I expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
with the Soldiers for taking away my Sword, which they
had nothing to do with; which they denied, or ſhifted from one
to another; which was all I cared for. Then I complained that
my Brother ſhould be hurried into Priſon upon the Story of a
Rogue, whoſe Mother was hanged for a Witch: This, my Father
ſaid, was too late now, for my Brother had confeſt all to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour;
it ſeems they had put burning Matches between his
Fingers to do it.</p>
                  <p>So I went to the Governour, and told him how unhappy my
poor Brother was, to be ſo hardly uſed upon the ſole Teſtimony
of ſo vile a Fellow. To which he anſwered, <hi>That it was paſt
now; and by that time his Examination was before the Protector.</hi>
But, ſaid I, if you have any thing againſt my Brother, it does
not appear you have any thing againſt my Father; and his Caſe
was not uſual heretofore, an aged unweildy Man to have his
Houſe invaded at Midnight, and his Perſon hurried into Priſon at
that ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>To which the Governour anſwered, That what the <hi>Protector</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
that my Father ſhould give Security to the <hi>Protector</hi> for
his Good Behaviour (which I was ſure he would never do) could
do my Father no hurt.</p>
                  <p>To which I replied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That no Man who is bound to his Good
Behaviour is taken for a Man of Good Behaviour; and that now,
as the <hi>Protector</hi> will have the tenth part of his Eſtate for having
been ſequeſtred, ſo he might take half or all his Eſtate for having
been bound to his Good Behaviour. To which the Governour not
anſwering, told me, <hi>He would not have taken the Language my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gave the Protector from any body elſe.</hi> I told him, <hi>My Father
always led a free Life, and the Governour could not expect he ſhould
be metamorphos'd upon his Appearance before him.</hi> So I left him,
and went to my Father, and asked him what he had ſaid which
gave the Governour ſuch Offence? He ſaid he knew nothing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it were that the Governour ask'd him if he knew the <hi>Protector?</hi>
he ſaid, yes, and his Father too, when he kept his Brew-houſe at
<hi>Huntington.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next Day the Soldiers carried my Brother for <hi>London:</hi> I went
part of the way with him, and, when I could get an Opportunity,
inſtructed him what to do: and about three Days after, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>er
returned to his Houſe in Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon</hi>'s Coach; for after
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:60932:201"/>
my Brother was gone, the Governour ordered my Father to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed;
who to get out of Town, not ſtaying to ſend for his own
Coach or Horſes, took one of the Carts (peculiar to the Town of
<hi>Yarmouth,</hi> which have two Wheels behind, and over them a place
to carry Goods from Shipboard to the Merchants Ware-houſes)
and in it went to Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon</hi>'s. It's ſtrange how ſuch an
odd thing ſhould be ſo long remembred; for, above twenty Years
after, I being at the South End of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and my Horſe ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
at the North (about three quarters of a Mile) and ſeeing
one of theſe Carts, I asked the Owner if he would carry me to
my Inn, and I would give him Six-pence; we agreed, and the
Fellow told me how before he had carried my L—to Sir <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas
Bacon</hi>'s in it.</p>
                  <p>My Father had not been long returned, but he received a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
from <hi>Haynes</hi> to appear at <hi>Bury,</hi> to give the <hi>Protector</hi> Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for his Good Behaviour, and ſhew Cauſe why he ſhould not be
decimated. My Mother was now dead, and Security I was ſure
my Father would not give, nor any that I knew would appear
for him: So I took up his Caſe, and appeared for him; I excuſed
his not coming for his Age and Unweildineſs, which was allow'd:
But I told the Committee, my Father was not in their Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for tho he had been ſequeſtred, yet no Charge was alledged
againſt him; and ſo, upon hearing his Caſe, the Parliament diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
his Sequeſtration: But 'twas to no purpoſe to talk Reaſon
to theſe Fellows, for they ſaid, he was in their Inſtructions, and
ſo order'd him to be decimated. I told them I would not ſubmit
to it, but proteſted againſt it, and appeal'd from them to the
<hi>Protector.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I was content to take this Occaſion to go to <hi>London,</hi> more to take
Care of my Brother than in hopes to get off my Father's Decima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And when I came to <hi>London,</hi> I knew not how to get a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
to be delivered to <hi>Cromwel.</hi> Major-General <hi>Skippon</hi>'s Father
was Servant to my Grand-father, and eldeſt Uncle, to whom I
went; but when I named my Father, and his Caſe, he went out
of the Room. I then applied my ſelf to Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Bacon,</hi>
who was one of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Maſters of Requeſts; who promiſed to
deliver my Father's Caſe to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and that I ſhould have an
Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>So I appear'd before <hi>Cromwel,</hi> (which was the only time I ever
ſaw him) in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Chamber in <hi>White-hall;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
ſtood at the further Door, and <hi>Cromwel</hi> and I at the Door
next the Cloſet: <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſeem'd to read the Petition, tho to my
Apprehenſion he read not one Line of it, but ſometimes look'd
upon me, then upon the Paper; and after ſome Pauſe told me,
Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> ſhould give me a ſatisfactory Anſwer: Then <hi>Cromwel</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>old me, <hi>He knew my Father very well, and that I had a very fair
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:60932:202"/>
Siſter;</hi> and I believe would have gone on at this rate, when I
humbly thank'd his Highneſs for his Favour to my Father, and ſo
went off.</p>
                  <p>I had heard enough of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> not to believe any thing he
ſaid; and therefore I told Mr. <hi>Bacon,</hi> that unleſs I ſaw the Order
of the <hi>Protector</hi> to the Major-General upon my Father's Appeal, I
would not take it out. Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> told me, it was not uſual, yet
I ſhould have it; which was as much as I could deſire. Yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſome private Queries between <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Paraſites, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
nothing as to my Father's Decimation; but whether the
conteſting his not being in the Major-General's Inſtruction, or the
Humour of giving Security being abated, my Father was not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proſecuted for giving Security, which was all I cared for;
and I believe my Father was the only Man who was ſequeſtred in
<hi>England,</hi> who eſcaped it without Impriſonment.</p>
                  <p>My Brother proved ſtanch (as we ſay) and would not make
any further Diſcovery, tho <hi>Cromwel</hi> proffer'd to prefer him in the
Army; and the Major-General's Power declining, and <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s
third Parliament coming on, at laſt, by my own proper Charges,
I got him releaſed.</p>
                  <p>About this time <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſent Colonel <hi>Overton</hi> (it may be
ſuſpecting <hi>Monk)</hi> with a Commiſſion to command in the North
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as Major-General. <hi>Overton</hi> being a <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-Man,</hi>
highly ſtomach'd <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Protectorſhip, anew ſets up Agitators in
their ſeveral Regiments, and had ſeveral Meetings with them at <hi>Abe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen:</hi>
They drew up a Declaration againſt <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Uſurpation;
of this <hi>Monk</hi> had Knowledg, but took little Care to diſturb them:
but when they agreed upon their Declaration againſt <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
they conſult how to aſſaſſinate or ſecure <hi>Monk;</hi> who thereupon
changes and encreaſes his Guards, ſeizes upon the Conſpirators,
tries ſeveral of them, caſhiers others, and ſends <hi>Overton</hi> Priſoner
to <hi>Cromwel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe Times a Rapſody of <hi>Socinianiſm, Pelagianiſm,</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm,</hi>
as ſprung from the Seeds of <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> was vented all
over the Nation, eſpecially in the Army: the Ringleaders of theſe
were <hi>Bidle, Cops, Fry, Erbury, Saltmarſh,</hi> &amp;c. But more blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
than theſe was one <hi>James Naylor,</hi> (I ſaw him when he ſtood
in the Pillory before <hi>Weſtminſter-hall)</hi> who perſonated our Saviour
(and was like his Picture) in his Words and Geſtures; and ſo mad
was he, and many of his Crew, that getting upon a Horſe-Colt
(an Aſs would have becom'd him better) he came riding to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,</hi>
his Sect ſtrewing his way with Leaves and Boughs of Trees,
crying <hi>Hoſanna, Bleſſed is he who cometh in the Name of the Lord.</hi>
Nor did he ſtay here, but imitated our Saviour in affecting his
Divinity; as, that he could Raiſe the Dead, Heal the Sick, and
Faſt 40 Days.</p>

                     <pb n="397" facs="tcp:60932:202"/>
In theſe Diſtractions without (to prevent which <hi>Cromwel</hi> took
little Care) <hi>Cromwel</hi> had little Peace within: He was obey'd by
none for Love; had no Title to his Greatneſs but by <hi>Barebone</hi>'s
<hi>Parliament,</hi> of his own making, his own Will, and the Flattery of
ſome of the Officers of his Army: yet the Body of the Army, and
a greater part of the Officers, look'd upon him as a Tyrant and
Uſurper; and with theſe the Generality of the <hi>Commonwealth
Party</hi> agreed: The <hi>Presbyterian Party</hi> hated him, and he knew
the <hi>Royaliſts</hi> would never obey him, if ever they could find an
Opportunity to get rid of him.</p>
                  <p>The Crown-Lands, and the eſtabliſhed Revenues, he reſerved
by his Inſtrument of Government, would not near maintain the
Charges of his Intelligence and Army, which in a manner lived
upon Free Quarter; and the <hi>Decimation</hi> of the <hi>Royaliſts</hi> bore no
Proportion to ſupport them. His Expendition to <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> from
which he expected Mountains of Gold, proved not only diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
but thereby he contracted ſo great a Debt, as he could
never live to overgrow.</p>
                  <p>In theſe Diſquietudes of Mind, his Looks were intent upon new
and unuſual Spectacles: He took particular notice of the Carriage,
Manners, Habit, and Language of all Strangers, eſpecially if they
ſeemed joyful: He never ſtirr'd abroad without ſtrong Guards,
wearing Armour under his Clothes, and offenſive Arms too; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
came back the common Road, or the ſame Way he went, and
always paſſing with great ſpeed; had many Locks and Keys for
the Door of his Houſes; ſeldom ſlept above three Nights in one
Chamber, nor in any which had not two or three Back-doors, and
Guards at all of them.</p>
                  <p>To theſe, Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> in the ſecond Part of his <hi>Elenchus,</hi> adds
this, That <hi>Cromwel</hi> being much troubled with the Stone, uſed
ſometimes to ſwill down ſeveral ſorts of Liquors, and then ſtir
his Body by ſome violent kind of Motion, as, riding hard on
Horſeback, jolting in a Coach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that by ſuch Agitation he
might disburden his Bladder. Wherefore one Day he took with
him his Secretary <hi>Thurlow,</hi> that they two might privately uſe this
Exerciſe in a Coach in <hi>Hide-Park.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they came thither, <hi>Cromwel</hi> got into the Coach-box,
drawn by ſix brave Horſes, lately preſented to him by Count <hi>Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenburg;</hi>
and ſo ſoon as <hi>Cromwel</hi> began to ſnap his Whip, the
Horſes ran away, and the Poſtilion was thrown off the Fore-horſe;
the Horſes fretting and growing unruly, toſt <hi>Cromwel</hi> from his
Seat upon the Pole, and falling from thence upon the Ground,
was intangled in his Coat, and dragged up and down till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
many Bruiſes, a Pocket-Piſtol in the mean time going off,

However <hi>Cromwel,</hi> to eſtabliſh his ill-acquired Greatneſs in his
Family, makes his Son <hi>Henry</hi> Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and fain would
have made his Son <hi>Richard</hi> Governour of <hi>Scotland;</hi> but <hi>Monk</hi>
would not budg there, which it may be was as great an Affliction
to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> as all thoſe he laboured under before.</p>
                  <p>Now was <hi>Cromwel</hi> driven to a Forc'd-put; if a Parliament could
not help him, he had loſt his Game: So he in <hi>September</hi> 1656
ſets up a new Bawble, call'd a Parliament. <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſet his Wits
upon Tenterhooks to have thoſe choſen for <hi>England</hi> to be for his
Turn; he cared not ſo much for thoſe ſent from <hi>Scotland</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> being ſure of them.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe, his Major-Generals uſed all their Endeavours
equally to hinder the Elections of <hi>Royaliſts</hi> and <hi>Republicans,</hi> for
neither would ſute with <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Deſigns: However, <hi>Cromwel</hi>
would not ſuffer any to enter the Houſe before he ſubſcribed to
the Authority of the <hi>Protector.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Men choſe Sir <hi>Thomas Widdrington</hi> Speaker, who <hi>June
1657</hi> begirt <hi>Cromwel</hi> in <hi>Protectorean Robes,</hi> for <hi>King</hi> he would not
be; and told him, That the <hi>Robe of Purple</hi> is the <hi>Emblem of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy,</hi>
which imports <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Juſtice;</hi> the <hi>Robe</hi> of
<hi>Mixt Colour, Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy;</hi> and a great deal more of ſuch
Stuff, which <hi>Cromwel</hi> regarded no more than he did <hi>Barebone</hi>'s
<hi>Parliament</hi> and his <hi>Inſtrument of Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To eaſe <hi>Cromwel</hi> of the Trouble, this Parliament put down the
Major-Generals, who were become troubleſome to <hi>Cromwel</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as well as the Nation in general; and made it Treaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
<hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Death; and that the <hi>Royal Family</hi> ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.
Theſe gave <hi>Cromwel</hi> the <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> and a <hi>Triennial Tax</hi>
upon all Houſes built upon New Foundations in <hi>London,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ten Miles round, that every one of them ſhould pay <hi>Cromwel</hi> a
Year's Rent: And to endear him the more, this Parliament gave
<hi>Cromwel</hi> Leave to name his ſucceeding <hi>Protector;</hi> which he kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accepted.</p>
                  <p>By this you may ſee the Nature of the Beaſt; for when <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s
former Parliament diſputed the Authority of his <hi>Inſtrument
of Government,</hi> he told them, <hi>It was the Foundation of Government
upon which they must build, and not deſtroy; and therefore it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable
by Act of Parliament: and by the Inſtrument his Council was
to chuſe a Succeſſor.</hi> But now 'tis for his Turn, the Parliament
may alter his Inſtrument, and give him Power to name his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor.</p>
                  <p>This Alteration of naming a Succeſſor, had another Effect too;
for <hi>Lambert,</hi> who expected to ſucceed <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and therefore
told <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s former Parliament, That unleſs they would confirm
it, they (the Officers of the Army) would call another, and a
third and fourth, till the <hi>Inſtrument of Government</hi> was confirmed.
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:60932:205"/>
Now his Hopes of Succeſſion were balk'd, he tack'd about, and
ſeem'd to join with the <hi>Republican Party.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Cromwel</hi>
took away <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Commiſſion, and made his Son-in-law <hi>Fleet-wood</hi>
Lieutenant-General in his place. So that tho <hi>Cromwel</hi> got a
Power after his Death, he diſtracted his Power whilſt he was alive.</p>
                  <p>And as <hi>Pedlars,</hi> which have not Gold, yet will ſhew ſomething
which may gliſter like it; ſo <hi>Cromwel,</hi> that his Parliament may
ſeem like a Parliament, will have a Houſe of Lords too: but
theſe are not Lords with Titles, but <hi>Lords of the Lord knows what.</hi>
If you'll take the Meaſures of the reſt, I'll give you a Liſt of ſome
of them: There was <hi>Pride</hi> the <hi>Brewer, Huſon</hi> the <hi>Shooe-maker,
Barkstead</hi> the <hi>Thimble-ſeller, Cooper</hi> an <hi>Haberdaſher of ſmall Wares,
Whaley</hi> a <hi>Broken Clothier,</hi> &amp;c. Yet theſe Lords muſt not be called
the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper,</hi> but <hi>The Other Houſe of Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nothing could have madded the</hi> Republicans <hi>more than this</hi>
Other Houſe of Parliament. What, <hi>ſaid they,</hi> have we fought to
Depoſe the <hi>Prerogative-Creatures,</hi> the <hi>Lords,</hi> thoſe <hi>Limbs of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
who ſo lorded it over the Free-born People of <hi>England;</hi> and ſhall
we ſubmit to theſe <hi>Creatures</hi> of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> to uſurp the ſame <hi>Tyranny</hi>
over us and the Free-born People of <hi>England!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor did this end in Words only, but the <hi>Republicans</hi> conſpire
to make an Inſurrection againſt <hi>Cromwel,</hi> but were diſcover'd and
diſperſed by <hi>Cromwel;</hi> for which, <hi>Cromwel</hi> committed <hi>Lawſon</hi>
(afterward Sir <hi>John) Harriſon, Rich,</hi> (Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s own Father)
<hi>Danvers,</hi> and ſeveral other Officers: And one <hi>Sundercome</hi> more
boldly attempted to have killed <hi>Cromwel,</hi> as he ſhould paſs from
<hi>White-hall</hi> to <hi>Hampton-Court;</hi> and to that purpoſe, had prepared
a Blunderbuſs loaded with twelve Bullets, to ſhoot him out of
an Arbour as he ſhould paſs in a narrow Way in <hi>Hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith:</hi>
but one <hi>Toop,</hi> who ſeemed to conſpire in it, diſcovered
this to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and ſo <hi>Sundercome</hi> was taken, and condemned
for High Treaſon by <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Law made this Parliament: but
<hi>Sundercome</hi> eſcaped the Execution, being found dead in his Bed
before.</p>
                  <p>Nor did <hi>this</hi> and the <hi>Other Houſe</hi> agree better than <hi>Cromwel</hi> and
the <hi>Commonwealth-Men; this</hi> ſcorned the <hi>Other Houſe,</hi> as having
no Authority from the People, and were as vain as uſeleſs: ſo
that to prevent further Heats, <hi>Cromwel</hi> adjourns them for ſix
Months.</p>
                  <p>I'll vie this <hi>Cromwel</hi> againſt <hi>Tarquin, Agathocles,</hi> either of the
<hi>Dionyſius</hi>'s, or any of the <hi>Roman, Athenian</hi> or <hi>Sicilian Tyrants,</hi> that
he was a more arrogant and boundleſs Tyrant than any or all of
them.</p>
                  <p>For if Tyranny be either <hi>Sine Titulo, viz.</hi> To arrogate a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over another, which he hath nothing to do with, or <hi>ab Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citio,</hi>
to be bound by no Laws; then both ways <hi>Cromwel</hi> was a
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:60932:206"/>
greater Tyrant; for <hi>Tarquin</hi> had a Title, and his Vices were rather
perſonal and particular, than tending to ſubvert the <hi>Roman Laws</hi> and
<hi>Conſtitutions:</hi> So were the Vices of <hi>Agathocles</hi> and both the <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>'s,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Title was only from ſome corrupted
Officers of an Army raiſed by his twice depoſed Maſters, and what
<hi>Widdrington</hi> begirt him with.</p>
                  <p>So tho <hi>Ceſar</hi> and his Succeſſors, did aſſume to themſelves an
<hi>Imperial Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> which did not well ſute with the <hi>Conſular</hi> and
<hi>Tribunitial Dignities;</hi> yet they never made a Pack of Senators to
do whatſoever they would have them; nor forced or corrupted
the Free Voices of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in chuſing ſuch Tribunes as the
Emperors pleaſed; and permitted the <hi>Roman Laws</hi> to have their
free Courſe.</p>
                  <p>Whereas <hi>Cromwel</hi> made a Parliament (as 'twas called) of his
own Nomination; and tho he called two more, yet they met by
Elections utterly unknown to our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions;</hi> and
when they met, he would ſuffer none to ſit, but ſuch as would
own his Authority.</p>
                  <p>By our Laws the King cannot tax the Subject, but by Conſent
in Parliament; whereas <hi>Cromwel,</hi> by his <hi>Inſtrument of Government,</hi>
of his own Will alone, taxed the Nation to maintain him an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of Twenty Thouſand Foot and Ten Thouſand Horſe, and after
taxed the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> a tenth Part of their Eſtates.</p>
                  <p>It's the Birth-right of every <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> not to be puniſhed
in his Perſon, Liberty or Fortune, but by Judgment of his Peers,
or the Law of the Land; and theſe to be done by Legal Officers;
whereas this <hi>Cromwel,</hi> without any Law, impriſoned, and took
away Mens Lives and Eſtates, by a new thing called <hi>A High Court
of Juſtice,</hi> never heard of in this Nation, before the <hi>Rump</hi> and
himſelf; the Judges whereof were of his own naming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his
<hi>Janiſaries,</hi> the Soldiers, his Military Executioners.</p>
                  <p>But it may be objected, <hi>Cromwel</hi> had reaſon for erecting his
<hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi> having been ſo ill uſed by <hi>Jurors:</hi> for he
had by them tried <hi>John Lilburn</hi> twice for High Treaſon, and Sir
<hi>John Stawel</hi> thrice, who were acquitted by theſe Juries; yet neither
of them could be diſcharged from their Impriſonment, which by
Law they ought to have been.</p>
                  <p>But that which madded <hi>Cromwel</hi> moſt, and made him utterly out
of love with Juries, was, that three Men, <hi>Daviſon, Holder</hi> and
<hi>Thorold,</hi> being apprehended, upon Suſpicion of endeavouring to
bring in the King, were committed Priſoners to a Provoſt Marſhal;
and theſe having obtained leave of the Provoſt to walk abroad
under the Guard of a Souldier, they would have wheedled the
Souldier to have made their Eſcape, which the Souldier refuſing,
they killed him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="401" facs="tcp:60932:206"/>
                     <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who before deſigned to have ſacrificed theſe Men by
a High Court of Juſtice, having, as he thought, a more plain
Proof of Murder againſt them, than he had for their endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to bring in the King, would now try them at <hi>Common Law</hi> by a
Jury.</p>
                  <p>When they came upon their Trial, they pleaded Not Guilty;
and upon their Trial the Queſtion was, <hi>Whether they were legally
committed;</hi> which if the Jury found, they were to find them guilty
of Murder; if not, they could find it but <hi>ſe defendendo,</hi> or at
higheſt but Manſlaughter; and the Jury found them not legally
committed, and ſo acquitted them of Murder. This put <hi>Cromwel</hi>
ſo out of conceit with Juries, that he never after made uſe of
them in Capital Caſes: However by this he might ſee, he was as
little regarded by the Body of the Nation, as by his diſcarded
Officers and the Commonwealth-Men.</p>
                  <p>Nor was <hi>Cromwel</hi> a better Governour in Church than State, for
he proſtituted all Orders of Chriſtianity; and ſo little regarded
things dedicated to Sacred Uſes, that he made St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church a
Gariſon for his Souldiers, and a Stable for Horſes: and his Want of
Money was as Great, as the Love of the Nation was little.</p>
                  <p>This being a forc'd-Put, he'll try once more what he can get
by a Parliament; and that it may be a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> it ſhould
be made up of the other Houſe, and <hi>Republicans</hi> were permitted
to ſit in this. Thus qualified, they met upon the twentieth of
<hi>January,</hi> 1657. Never was ſuch Brawling heard, the <hi>Republicans</hi>
brawling againſt <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Creatures in this Houſe; and both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Lords in the other Houſe: ſo that it may be truly
ſaid of this Parliament,
<q>
                        <l>That this did out-babble that of <hi>Barebone</hi>'s as far,</l>
                        <l>As theſe above thoſe Men in Number are,</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>viz.</hi> Above Three-fold more.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cromwel</hi> therefore, not able to endure their Jangling longer,
and having got not a Groat by them, ſuddenly diſſolved them, and
ſhall never call another.</p>
                  <p>To make this Tragedy a little comical, Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> was as
little a Slave to his Word as <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and endeavoured to enlarge
the <hi>French</hi> Dominions by as unworthy means as <hi>Cromwel</hi> did to
eſtabliſh his. About this time a Party of the Gariſon of <hi>Oſtend,</hi>
with the Privity of the Governour, held Intelligence with <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi>
and after with <hi>Cromwel,</hi> to betray the Town to the <hi>French,</hi>
wherein <hi>Cromwel</hi> was to have his Share: <hi>Mazarine</hi> was to ſend a
Land-Army, commanded by Marſhal <hi>d'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Aumont,</hi> and <hi>Cromwel</hi> was
to provide a Fleet to tranſport them; and the Articles of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were agreed upon between the ſuppoſed Conſpirators and
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:60932:207"/>
the Cardinal in <hi>April 1658:</hi> but here <hi>Cromwel</hi> was at greater Charge
for his Fleet, than <hi>Mazarine</hi> for his Army, and <hi>Cromwel</hi> had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
<hi>Mazarine</hi> for the Bargain, but little Money was to be paid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Town was ſurrendred.</p>
                  <p>The Agreement being made, upon the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1658, the
Fleet appeared before <hi>Oſtend,</hi> and the Gariſon in the Fort permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the <hi>French</hi> to paſs and land; but the Governour fearing if the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet ſhould enter, they might endanger the Town, with
his own Hands pulled down the white Flag, and ſet up the bloody
Flag: but before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet could tack about, it was ſore
galled by the Artillery planted upon the Fort, before it could get
out of their reach; and the <hi>French</hi> which landed were killed or
taken every Mother's Son, to the number of 1500; the Marſhal
was of the number of the Priſoners. This Story is pleaſantly
and particularly printed in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> by one of the Agents; tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
into <hi>Engliſh</hi> under the Title of <hi>Harm watch, Harm catch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mazarine</hi> with much ado got his Men again which were not
killed; but how ſhall <hi>Cromwel</hi> get his Money again, of which he
had more need than <hi>Mazarine</hi> had of his Men? nor would <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
part with one Groat, he had been out of Pocket too much to
redeem the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this time <hi>Cromwel</hi> was in ill Plight, hated of all <hi>Factions</hi>
as much as of the <hi>Royaliſts;</hi> he had nothing to truſt to but a
Mercenary Army, which he could not pay, and above half of
theſe would have been content to have his Throat cut: His Means
would not pay for the Intelligence he was forced to buy at home
and abroad, to diſcover the Practices which were every day hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt him: So as he had no Security, but in the general
Fear, which all the Factions, as well as he, had, that their Diſcords
might give an Occaſion of reſtoring the King, to the ruine of
them all.</p>
                  <p>Nor were their Fears without Ground, for at this time there
was an Inclination of the <hi>Royaliſts</hi> in all parts of <hi>England</hi> to riſe;
and the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> was ſent by the King to encourage it,
having gotten a Company of Men together beyond Sea, under the
Command of General <hi>Marſin</hi> to aſſiſt them.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Cromwel</hi> had his Spies every where, who betray'd all; the
principal of theſe Spies was Sir <hi>Richard Willis,</hi> (who was always
upon his Diſcovery of theſe Plots, one of the firſt committed
to the Tower) and one <hi>Corker</hi> (who had ſerved King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Firſt, and was one who aſſiſted in killing <hi>Rainsborough</hi> at <hi>Doncaſter)</hi>
ſo as <hi>Cromwel</hi> nipp'd all in the Bud before they moved: Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all his Diligence, <hi>Ormond</hi> made his Eſcape, only to
give the King an Account of the Diſcovery and Ruine of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>

Though the <hi>Royaliſts</hi> could draw no Blood from <hi>Cromwel,</hi> yet
he reſolved to take ſome from them; yet would not do it by
Juries, (having had ſuch ill Luck with them) but by a Court of
Juſtice of his own Creatures and Nomination, headed by <hi>Liſle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before theſe were haled my Lord <hi>Mordant,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Hewet,</hi> the two <hi>Staleys, Woodcock, Mallery, Rivers, Dike,</hi> and
many others.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Hewet</hi> denied their Juriſdiction, and was condemned for
Contumacy; Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> pleaded, yet was condemned; my
Lord <hi>Mordant</hi> was acquitted by the Majority of one Vote, when
<hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Woodcock</hi> behaved himſelf ſo well as he was acquitted: The
reſt were condemned, yet ſome for Money got their Pardons; and
others, who had not ſo much Money, for ſomewhat leſs, and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves out of the Plot, ſaved their Lives. Sir <hi>Henry
Slingsby</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hewet</hi> were beheaded, others hanged and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
                  <p>Yet this good Succeſs gave little Comfort to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> for to
all his former Diſturbances were added the Diſorders of his own
Family; his Son-in-law <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> and Brother-in-law <hi>Desborough,</hi>
caballing with the <hi>Republicans</hi> and <hi>Diſſenting Officers,</hi> ſo as they
rarely viſited him; tho <hi>Cromwel,</hi> to ſweeten <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> promiſed
to name him his Succeſſor; and to theſe, <hi>Lambert,</hi> ſince his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carding,
joined.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cromwel</hi> having ſo little Dependance on his Army, ſets up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

their Pay was little, ſo were their Horſes Jades and lean, and a
Troop of any Army-Horſe would beat ten of them; yet they ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Cromwel</hi> ſo far, as to ſeize Malignants whenever he ſent them;
and were Spies over all ſuſpected Perſons, and to inform him of
their Demeanour.</p>
                  <p>All the Joy <hi>Cromwel</hi> had in theſe Anxieties and Inquietudes,
was in his beloved Daughter <hi>Cleypole,</hi> who even to his Heart-breaking,
died the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1658, and upon the third of

                     <head>The Good Deeds of Oliver Cromwel.</head>
                     <p>THUS in ſome meaſure, and in <hi>Epitome,</hi> you have ſeen, if not
the Life, yet the Rage of <hi>Cromwel</hi> in his Uſurpation; in
which, as I have ſaid nothing of him for Spite, having never
done me any Wrong, but what was common to all the Nation;
ſo I think in Juſtice I ought to do him Right, wherein (as I
conceive) he deſerved well of the Nation.</p>
                     <p>1. By <hi>Blake</hi> he more humbled and ſubdued the <hi>Algerine, Tripoli</hi>
and <hi>Tunis</hi> Pirates, than ever any before or ſince did.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> was never repleniſhed with more learned
and upright Judges than by him; nor was Juſtice either in Law or
Equity in Civil Caſes more equally diſtributed, where he was not
a Party.</p>
                     <p>3. When the <hi>Norway</hi> Traders repreſented to him the Miſchief
and Inconveniences the <hi>Act of Navigation</hi> brought upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(which may be at large ſaid elſewhere) <hi>Cromwel,</hi> during
his time, diſpenſed with it, and permitted the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to trade to
<hi>Norway</hi> for Timber, Maſts, Pitch, Tar and Iron, as before the
Act: And by a Law made in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Third Parliament in <hi>June
1657,</hi> which was but five Years after the Rump's <hi>Act of Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
Licence is given to tranſport Fiſh in Foreign Bottoms. See
<hi>Whitlock</hi>'s <hi>Memoirs, f. 661. a.</hi> So little then was the <hi>Act of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation</hi>
regarded.</p>
                     <p>4. Tho <hi>Cromwel</hi> play'd the Fool in making War upon <hi>Spain,</hi>
and Peace with <hi>France,</hi> yet he made a more advantageous Treaty
of Commerce for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> than before they had: I
have not ſeen it, but had this from our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants who
traded to <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. Tho <hi>Cromwel</hi> joined Forces with the <hi>French</hi> againſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi>
yet he reſerved the Sea-Towns conquered from the <hi>Spaniard</hi>
to himſelf; ſo had <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and <hi>Mardike</hi> delivered up to him; and
would have had <hi>Oſtend,</hi> if the Gariſon had not cheated both <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine</hi>
and him; thereby to be Arbitrator over the <hi>French,</hi> as well
as <hi>Spaniard,</hi> when he pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Cromwel</hi> out-vied the beſt of our Kings, in rendring our
Laws to the Subject in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue; for tho <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third (the moſt Excellent of our Kings) permitted Pleading in
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, yet he went no further; whereas <hi>Cromwel</hi>
rendred, not only the Pleadings, but Practice, and Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue; and herein he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> imitated our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
common Juſtice, and the Practice of the moſt Learned and
Civilized Nations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="405" facs="tcp:60932:208"/>
I ſay, he imitated our Saviour, who after his Aſcenſion wrought
his firſt Miracle, by inſpiring his Apoſtles to ſpeak all Languages,
to teach the Goſpel to all Nations in their Native Tongue; and by
the ſame reaſon, all Nations ought to be inſtructed in their Laws
in their own Tongue.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, this is conformable to common Juſtice; for all Laws ought
to be <hi>a Priori:</hi> for where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and if Laws be rendred in a Tongue not underſtood, it's all one
to thoſe who underſtand not the Language, as if there had not
been Laws.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> who were the moſt Learned and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliz'd
of all Nations, would never endure a Foreign Word in any
of their Laws, leſt the Subject through Ignorance of it might be
unjuſtly puniſhed, when 'twas not his fault. When <hi>Caeſar</hi> was
murder'd in the Senate, and the Senators were ready to cut one
another's Throats, <hi>Cicero</hi> cried out, <hi>Let there be an</hi> Amneſtia, <hi>and
for the future the Power to reſide in the Senate:</hi> And you may read
in his ſecond <hi>Philippicks,</hi> the long Apology he makes for ſuddenly
uſing this Foreign Word in the Senate. And <hi>Tiberius</hi> asked leave
of the Senate to uſe <hi>Monopolion,</hi> becauſe 'twas foreign to the <hi>Latin.</hi>
And the <hi>Romans,</hi> as well as <hi>Grecians,</hi> not only inſtructed Youth
in their Laws, but in all Arts and Sciences in their Mother-Tongue,
and thereby became the moſt Learned of all Nations. But
theſe good Deeds of <hi>Cromwel</hi> you'll ſoon ſee will not long out-live
him.</p>

Council (which by the <hi>Inſtrument of Government</hi> had the

                     <hi>Richard</hi> thus ſeated, not only the <hi>Protectorian,</hi> but the Officers

promiſe to be true to him: and what <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly
obtained from the Mercenary Officers of the Army in
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> to congratulate him in his aſſuming the
Protectorian Dignity, and to aſſiſt him in it with their Lives and
Fortunes, is now voluntarily done by numerous Companies of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophants
from all Parts of the Nation, to the number of ninety
Congratulatory Addreſſes, which <hi>Richard</hi> had as little good of, as
King <hi>James</hi> II. had from thoſe above thirty Years after, <hi>When
they flatter'd that Prince in thoſe things which tended to the Subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Richard</hi>'s wandring Joys faded in the Bud: For after his
Father's Funeral, the Pomp whereof undid him, the Republican
Officers cabal and conſpire to depoſe <hi>Richard,</hi> and exalt <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood;</hi>
and in two reſpects they ſay <hi>Fleetwood</hi> ought to be <hi>Protector;</hi>
one, that he was truly Godly, and an expert Leader, and had
been tried to be ſo in many Difficulties: The other, <hi>Cromwel</hi> had
by his laſt Will, when he was <hi>Compos Mentis,</hi> deſign'd him his
Succeſſor; whereas <hi>Richard</hi> was ſubſtituted in a ſurreptitious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
by the Craft of ſome of the Council, when <hi>Cromwel</hi> had loſt
his Senſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lambert,</hi> after he had been diſcarded by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to <hi>Wimbleton-Houſe,</hi> where he turned Floriſt, and had the

                     </gap>owers that could be got for Love or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
yet in theſe outward Pleaſures he nouriſhed the Ambition
he entertain'd before he was caſhier'd by <hi>Cromwel:</hi> And in theſe
Diſſenſions, as Tortoiſes do upon the approach of the Spring, he
comes abroad, and becomes a prime Ring-leader in the Cabal, and
in due time ſhall be the Ruin of them all.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing they agree upon, was to reſtore the common
Souldiers to their former Pay, which <hi>Cromwel</hi> had retrench'd two
Pence a day: And herein they ſhew their good Will, as <hi>Dego</hi>
did; but how to pay the Souldiers they could no more tell, than
how <hi>Dego</hi>'s Executors ſhould pay his Legacies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In this Kindneſs to the common Souldiers, the Officers did not
forget themſelves, and charge the Memory of</hi> Cromwel, <hi>that he
ruled over them with a Tyrannical and Deſpotical Power, turning
out and putting in Officers by his own Will; therefore they peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
Richard, That for the future, no Souldier be turned out of his
place without a Council of War, nor any Action brought but by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Law: That no Souldier be tried in any Criminal Caſe, but in a
Court-Martial; and that the Souldiers have Power to chuſe their own
General.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richard</hi> was Head of no Faction as his Brother <hi>Fleetwood</hi> was,

                  <p>Therefore <hi>Richard</hi> ſummons a Parliament to meet at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
upon the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1658, of the Compoſition made by his
Father, <hi>of this</hi> and <hi>t'other Houſe;</hi> this to conſiſt of 400 <hi>Engliſh,

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This</hi> and <hi>t'other Houſe</hi> met accordingly, when <hi>this Houſe</hi> fell at
Variance with <hi>t'other Houſe,</hi> by what Right they ſat there: Nor did
<hi>this Houſe</hi> agree better with the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſitting there, having
no Right to ſit and vote with the free-born <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they being
conquer'd Slaves, and Creatures of the <hi>Protector:</hi> Nor did the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican</hi>
and <hi>Protectorian Factions</hi> agree better. However, all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to recognize <hi>Richard</hi> Protector of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and
<hi>Ireland;</hi> yet would not agree to <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s <hi>Inſtrument of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
but inveighed bitterly againſt it, as being extorted from a
lame Parliament that was neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<hi>Overton,</hi> who was impriſoned in <hi>Jerſey</hi> by the Arbitrary Will of
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> and made an Ordinance againſt the meeting of the
Officers of the Army to hold Conſultations; till the Parliament
ſhould determine Affairs.</p>
                  <p>This Ordinance ſtung the Caballing Officers to the quick, ſo
that they reſolved to be rid of <hi>Richard</hi> and his Parliament too;
but how to do this, or where to begin, admitted of great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate:
For to begin at <hi>Richard</hi> now the Parliament was ſitting
might be dangerous, ſince the Parliament had ſo lately recognized
him, and ſo many thouſands of the People had congratulated his
Aſſumption into the Protectorate. And to begin at the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might be as dangerous, for this they thought would diſguſt
the Nation in general; neither did they know whether the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would be disbanded by them: they therefore reſolve they'll
make <hi>Richard</hi> diſſolve them, and take the <hi>Odium</hi> upon himſelf;
and when that's done, they'll do well enough with <hi>Richard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this end the Officers urge <hi>Richard</hi> to make good their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals:
but the <hi>Protectorian</hi> Officers adviſed him to ſeize the Heads
of the Republican, which tho <hi>Richard</hi> durſt not come to, yet he
ſpake high, and threatned the Officers to caſhier them.</p>
                  <p>This had a double Effect, for the <hi>Protectorian</hi> Officers, the Lord
<hi>Falconbridg,</hi> Captain <hi>Philip Howard,</hi> Colonel <hi>Ingoldsby, Whaley, Goff,</hi>
and others, ſeeing the meanneſs of <hi>Richard</hi>'s Spirit in neglecting
their Advice, leave him, and the Republicans were not to be quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with Words, but exaſperated by them; ſo that upon the <hi>22d</hi>
of <hi>April</hi> they beſet <hi>White-hall,</hi> and ſent <hi>Desborough</hi> and <hi>Fleetwood,</hi>
to beſeech him to diſſolve the Parliament; and if 'twere not
ſpeedily done, they would ſet fire to the Houſe, and kill all who
ſhould reſiſt; which ſo frightned <hi>Richard,</hi> that he forthwith ſigns
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:60932:210"/>
a Proclamation for diſſolving the Parliament. The Parliament
thus diſſolved, <hi>Richard</hi>'s Turn was next to be depoſed, not one
of the manifold thouſands of the ninety Congratulatory Addreſſes,
who promiſed to ſtand by <hi>Richard</hi> with their Lives and Fortunes,
ſpeaking one word in his behalf; and ſo ſhall ſuch another Turn
about thirty Years after be ſerved on King <hi>James</hi> the Second.</p>
                  <p>Tho <hi>Richard</hi> and his Parliament were out, yet ſomething elſe
muſt be in; yet before they would put in any thing elſe, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican
Officers ſend <hi>Ingoldsby, Goff, Whaley,</hi> my Lord <hi>Falconbridg</hi>
and <hi>Howard</hi> (after Earl of <hi>Carliſle)</hi> after <hi>Richard</hi> and his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and take in <hi>Lambert, Harriſon, Rich, Parker, Okey,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
whom <hi>Cromwel</hi> turn'd out: But before they would ſet up
any thing inſtead of <hi>Protector,</hi> they make <hi>Fleetwood</hi> General by
Sea and Land, and <hi>Lambert</hi> Lieut. General.</p>
                  <p>To prepare the way for what was to be ſet up, the Officers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
a Remonſtrance, inveighing bitterly againſt the Malignants,
(for ſo they call'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

marked for Deſtruction the Godly (eſpecially the King's Judges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>);
and therefore they would revive the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> and reſtore
the Rump Parliament: but <hi>William Pryn,</hi> according to his rude way
of writing, anſwered them, <hi>That their Cauſe was neither Good nor
Old,</hi> and bitterly charges them with Treachery and Ingratitude.</p>
                  <p>But all to no purpoſe; for ſince no better was to be had, theſe
Officers awake the <hi>Rump</hi> out of their Lethargy, wherein they
had been above five Years aſleep, and now were become ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
lean, that none but the Officers could abide the ſight of
them; they could get but forty two together, and theſe looked ſo
wretchedly, that they had much ado to get <hi>Lenthal</hi> to be Head
again to it. But how naſty ſoever the <hi>Rump</hi> was, the firſt ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Members would have ſat with them, but the <hi>Rump</hi> would
none of that, but ſet Guards at the Door of the Houſe to keep
them out.</p>
                  <p>Thus got together, they again depoſe <hi>Richard,</hi> and ſend <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>
to do the ſame by <hi>Henry</hi> in <hi>Ireland:</hi> and thus you ſee what Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
can be had by relying upon a Mercenary Army, one part of

both the Sons.</p>
                  <p>But in <hi>Scotland</hi> they let <hi>Monk</hi> alone, who promiſed to be true

Officers expected by reſtoring the <hi>Rump;</hi> for the <hi>Rump,</hi> tho it had

<hi>Ireland,</hi> by Sea and Land.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Rump</hi> being contemptible to all the Nation, and the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the Army being thus divided and ſubdued, and like <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal-Jacks,</hi>
                     <pb n="409" facs="tcp:60932:210"/>
when one was up the other was down, raiſed the
Expectation of the Royaliſts, <hi>That a ſudden Change would be, which
could end in nothing but reſtoring the King:</hi> And the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi>
exaſperated by the <hi>Rump</hi>'s Repulſe, again reſolve not to ſit quiet
under it, and therefore a Correſpondence is held between them
and the Royaliſts, to depoſe the <hi>Rump</hi> whatever came of it.</p>
                  <p>To this end Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> riſes in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> with whom Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Middleton</hi> joined, but was ill ſeconded by the Royaliſts.</p>
                  <p>This alarm'd the <hi>Rump,</hi> for they expected no better from the
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> than the <hi>Royaliſts:</hi> And now the <hi>Rump</hi> not well
knowing the Man, had ſo little Wit as to ſend <hi>Lambert</hi> againſt
Sir <hi>George;</hi> and you'll ſoon ſee <hi>Lambert</hi> ſhall do that by the <hi>Rump,</hi>
which the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Royaliſts</hi> both together could not do.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Lambert</hi> having overthrown <hi>Booth,</hi> and taken him Priſoner,
tho the <hi>Rump</hi> were mightily joy'd at it, and voted <hi>Lambert</hi> a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity
of a Thouſand Pounds, yet this no ways alter'd the Deſigns
of <hi>Lambert,</hi> which ever ſince the Death of <hi>Cromwel</hi> he had been
hatching.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Lambert,</hi> after the Defeat of the <hi>Cheſhire-men</hi> (in his return
for <hi>London)</hi> at <hi>Derby,</hi> the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> procured a Petition
from the Officers to the <hi>Rump,</hi> that <hi>Fleetwood</hi> might be General of
the Army, and himſelf Lieutenant-General: He was content to give
<hi>Fleetwood</hi> the firſt Place, as <hi>Cromwel</hi> had given <hi>Fairfax;</hi> for he
knew himſelf to be too hard for <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> and a much better
Souldier, and ſo would do what he liſt: And the greater part of
the Officers in <hi>London</hi> join with <hi>Lambert</hi> in his Petition.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Rump</hi> was more alarm'd at this Petition, than at Sir <hi>George
Booth</hi>'s Inſurrection; ſo as all Proſecution againſt him and the
<hi>Cheſhire</hi>-Men was at a ſtand; nor were the <hi>Rump</hi> of one piece a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves: for Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerig</hi> (a hot-headed Man)
was violently againſt the Army, and ſaid, they made the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a precarious thing; and that <hi>Lambert</hi> trod <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Steps,
and his ſeeming Modeſty in preferring <hi>Fleetwood</hi> was but a Decoy:
But young Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> now become old Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> with much
more cunning, endeavour'd to carry on the Deſigns of <hi>Lambert</hi>
and his Faction.</p>
                  <p>However, the Majority of the Members, rather than be depoſed,
depoſe <hi>Lambert, Desborough, Berry, Kelſey, Aſhfield, Cobbet, Creed,
Parker</hi> and <hi>Barrow,</hi> and make a Council of War, without naming
a General, of <hi>Fleetwood, Monk, Haſlerig, Ludlow, Morley</hi> and <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
And to ſtarve <hi>Lambert</hi> and his Officers, the <hi>Rump</hi> vote, <hi>That
no Money ſhall be raiſed without Conſent in Parliament, and he that
ſhall do it, ſhall be guilty of High-Treaſon againſt the Commonwealth.</hi>
And the Nation, to whom the <hi>Rump</hi> and Army were alike hateful,
took this for a very good Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="410" facs="tcp:60932:211"/>
However, before this Infant Council of War ſhould be warm in
their Seats, <hi>Lambert</hi> reſolves to beat up their Quarters, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
directly to <hi>London:</hi> but the <hi>Rump,</hi> who had Intelligence of
<hi>Lambert</hi>'s Motion, would not tamely be turn'd out, but appoint
<hi>Moſs</hi> and <hi>Morley</hi>'s Regiments to guard the Houſe; yet <hi>Lambert,</hi>
upon the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> with a ſtronger Guard, haſtens to the
<hi>Old-Palace-Yard,</hi> and before the Members came, ſet Guards upon
all the Avenues to the Houſe, not permitting any Member to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and ſends the Speaker back into the City.</p>
                  <p>Now is the <hi>Rump</hi>'s Lethargy (from which they were recover'd
but five Months and ſome few Days) turned into a Convulſion;
and the next Fit you'll ſee will carry it quite off.</p>
                  <p>Inſtead of the <hi>Rump,</hi> the Officers ſet up a new thing, which
they call <hi>The Committee of Safety,</hi> which conſiſted of 22; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Vane, Fleetwood,</hi> and <hi>Ludlow,</hi> were prime Directors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lambert</hi> having thus turned out the <hi>Rump,</hi> his Turn ſhall be
next: But before we proceed, it's fit to ſee how things ſtood in
<hi>Scotland;</hi> where, at this time, all things (contrary to the <hi>Scotiſh</hi>
Temper) were in perfect Peace and Quiet: and to keep the
<hi>Scots</hi> ſo, the <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>Cromwel</hi> had built four Citadels upon the
four principal Paſſes in <hi>Scotland, viz.</hi> at <hi>Leith, Aire, St. Johnſtons,</hi>
and <hi>Inverneſs,</hi> which bridled the <hi>Scots</hi> from holding Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
within Land, and which coſt above 30000 <hi>l.</hi> being three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Fortifications on the North Sea, and one upon the Weſt, for
to relieve the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in caſe of Land-Sieges, or other Accidents.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Monk</hi> had perfectly ſubdued <hi>Scotland,</hi> he took Care for
conſtant Supplies out of <hi>England</hi> for the Payment of his Soldiers,
whereby he kept them in ſuch regular and ſevere Diſcipline, that
Diſorders rarely happen'd among them; and hereby <hi>Scotland</hi> did
never before abound in ſo much Wealth and Trade: and to theſe,
<hi>Monk</hi> duly obſerved all Articles made with the <hi>Scots,</hi> whereby the
common ſort of <hi>Scots</hi> enjoyed more Liberty and Wealth than ever
before they had under their Lords and Lairds: and now no Man
durſt oppreſs his poor Tenants and Neighbours. He likewiſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
all thoſe <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Feuds which before ſo often raged in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and compelled the Clergy to mind their own Function, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
meddling with Temporal Affairs. So as the <hi>Scots</hi> never lived
ſo free and happy under their Kings, Nobles, and Lairds, as in
that ſhort time they did under <hi>Monk</hi>'s Regency.</p>
                  <p>In this State <hi>Monk</hi> hired the Counteſs of <hi>Bucklough</hi>'s Houſe,
about five Miles from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which had fine Gardens, Orchards,
and a ſtately Park, walled about, belonging to it; and here he
fell into the Acquaintance of the principal Nobility and Gentry of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and by his Familiarity and Affability with them, he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Love and Friendſhip: And in this State <hi>Cromwel</hi> would
have found it a hard Task to remove him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="411" facs="tcp:60932:211"/>
After <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Death, and that his Son <hi>Richard</hi> became <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi>
he careſs'd <hi>Monk</hi> by frequent Letters, and great Proteſtations
of Kindneſs, intreating alſo his Advice and Aſſiſtance, letting him
know, that his Father did recommend to him, as an eſpecial
Command, to be chiefly ruled by his Prudence. <hi>Monk</hi> in return
anſwered, That he was very remote, and could not well tell
what to write at ſuch a diſtance; but adviſed him to call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which was the Wiſdom of the Nation, by whom he might
be beſt inſtructed: which <hi>Richard</hi> did, and if he had ſtood by
them, it's thought <hi>Monk</hi> would have ſtood by him; but <hi>Richard</hi>
ſpoil'd all by diſſolving the Parliament; and when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
had depoſed his Brother <hi>Henry,</hi> by frequent Meſſages and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
he invited <hi>Monk</hi> to appear, to give a Check to the mutinous and
ſeditious <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, which now courted <hi>Monk</hi> as well as he;
and ſo did the <hi>Rump</hi> after they were reſtored: So that in all
the Troubles and Alterations in <hi>England,</hi> both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>
too courted <hi>Monk,</hi> who ſat ſtill, and was quiet in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lambert</hi>'s firy Ambition burnt out that Prudence which <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
obſerved, in making ſure of <hi>Monk</hi> before he attempted to turn
out the <hi>Rump;</hi> which <hi>Lambert</hi> did not, nor ſo much as made his
Deſign known to <hi>Monk.</hi> The turning out the <hi>Rump,</hi> and erecting
a <hi>Committee of Safety</hi> to govern, being Sectaries, Republicans, and
Enemies to <hi>Monk,</hi> which he called <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> he knew no Good
was intended him by this Change; and therefore reſolved not to
ſubmit to it: But herein <hi>Monk</hi> proceeded with as much Caution
and Prudence, as <hi>Lambert</hi> did in Haſte and Folly. Here you may
ſee how Ambition and Intereſt change Mens Actions; for herein,
what <hi>Monk</hi> allowed in <hi>Cromwel,</hi> he diſclaims in <hi>Lambert.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For upon the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>October, Monk</hi> marched with his own
Guards from <hi>Dalkeith</hi> to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where his own Regiment of
Foot quartered, and ſeized all ſuch Officers as he ſuſpected would
not be true to him in his Deſign, and ſecur'd them; and drew his
Forces into the Field, and gave them an Account of his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>To adhere to a Civil Authority, and not to follow the</hi> Engliſh
<hi>Army in their mad Counſels and Fanatick Courſes;</hi> which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by the Soldiers, and generally by the <hi>Scots.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At his Return out of the Field, he received an Expreſs from the
Governour of <hi>Berwick,</hi> That he feared he ſhould not be able to
ſecure the Town for him, almoſt all the Officers in the Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Anabaptiſts:</hi> Whereupon <hi>Monk</hi> gave Order for a Troop of
Horſe to march to <hi>Berwick,</hi> to fetch away the ill-affected Officers,
and ſent alſo a blank Commiſſion to the Governour to put in what
Officers he pleaſed; but it was difficult to get a Troop to march,
being about 40 Miles from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the Days ſhort, and Ways
deep and bad: yet Captain <hi>Johnſon</hi> undertook the Journey, and
arrived at <hi>Berwick</hi> but the Night before Colonel <hi>Cobbet</hi> entered
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:60932:212"/>
                     <hi>Berwick,</hi> ſent from <hi>Lambert;</hi> whom <hi>Johnſon</hi> ſeized, and ſent <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet</hi>
and the ſuſpected Officers Priſoners to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Twas well <hi>Monk</hi> ſucceeded ſo well at <hi>Berwick,</hi> for otherwiſe he
had had a hard Game to play, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army in <hi>Scotland</hi> being
far off, in the more remote Northern and Weſtern Parts of it, and
<hi>Lambert</hi> upon his March from <hi>London,</hi> with (it may be) the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
Body of Horſe in <hi>Europe,</hi> againſt him, and could augment his
Foot in his March. But if <hi>Monk</hi> was fortunate in reducing <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
he was not leſs unfortunate in endeavouring to reduce <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle;</hi>
for having ſent Captain <hi>Dean</hi> upon that Account, his whole
Troop deſerted him, and joined with the Gariſon. Beſides, <hi>Monk</hi>
having ſent Letters to many of the Officers in <hi>Ireland</hi> whom he
thought he might confide in, and to the Officers in the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Fleet then riding in the <hi>Downs,</hi> they all refuſed to join with him.
Hereupon the Sectaries in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army grew inſolent, and
drew off from <hi>Monk</hi> in Diſcontent: whereupon <hi>Monk</hi> kept back
their Pay, and bid them ſeek their Arrears of them to whom they
were going; which they could not have done in a worſe time,
now the <hi>Rump</hi> had voted it Treaſon to raiſe any Money to pay
them: theſe Officers were above 140, and their Arrears <hi>Monk</hi>
kept, the better to pay the Officers he could confide in. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
this could not ſecure <hi>Monk</hi> of thoſe Soldiers which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided
in; for <hi>Robinſon,</hi> a Captain of <hi>Dragoons,</hi> having received his
Pay, and the Soldiers Back, Breaſt, and Pot, ran away with his
whole Troop to <hi>New-Caſtle;</hi> and moſt of <hi>Twiſleton</hi>'s Regiment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<hi>Monk</hi>'s Service. However <hi>Monk,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Troutbeck,</hi> received
ſecret Aſſurance from my Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> to be aſſiſting to him.</p>
                  <p>Now with inſincere Affections both ſides agree to a Treaty of
Accommodation to be at <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Monk</hi> named <hi>Wilks, Knight,</hi>
and <hi>Cloberry,</hi> his Commiſſioners: theſe had publick Inſtructions
from the General Council, and private from the General; to
which the <hi>Committee of Safety</hi> named three (whoſe Names I do
not find) to treat with them. Theſe agreed that a Committee of
19 ſhould be appointed; five for <hi>England,</hi> not Members of the
Army, <hi>viz. Whitlock, Vane, Ludlow, Salway,</hi> and <hi>Berry;</hi> five for
<hi>Scotland,</hi> viz. <hi>St. John, Warreſton, Harrington, Scot,</hi> and <hi>Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi>
the reſt for <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be Members
of the Army; they to determine the Qualifications of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>That two Field-Officers of every Regiment, and one Commiſſion-Officer
of every Gariſon, and 10 Officers of the Fleet, ſhall meet at a
General Council, to adviſe touching the Form of Government.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monk,</hi> as aſtoniſhed at this Agreement, and contrary to his
wonted Reſervedneſs, told the Meſſenger, <hi>That if the Honeſty of
ſome, certainly the Prudence of them all was to be ſuſpected,</hi> and
committed <hi>Wilks</hi> to Priſon for tranſgreſſing his Commiſſion; and
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:60932:212"/>
'twas obſerved, he never was ſo much out of Humour as upon his
Commiſſioners aſſenting to this Agreement: for by this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the <hi>Committee</hi> would conſiſt of threefold more for <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Ireland</hi> than for <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the General Council fourfold
more: ſo that <hi>Monk</hi> and all the <hi>Scots</hi> Officers would be at their
diſpoſing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Gumble, <hi>pag. 152, 153. ſays, While</hi> Monk <hi>was in this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
Mood, not ſpeaking, or permitting any to ſpeak to him;
one of</hi> Monk'<hi>s Acquaintance, who was of a pleaſant and free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
came where</hi> Monk <hi>was, who asked this Gentleman,</hi> What
he had to ſay to this Agreement? Truly Sir, <hi>ſays he,</hi> I am come to
make a little Request to you. What's that, I wonder, <hi>ſays</hi> Monk?
Even that, <hi>ſays he,</hi> you will ſign me a Paſs to go for <hi>Holland;</hi> yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is a Ship at <hi>Leith</hi> that is ready to ſail. What, <hi>ſays</hi> Monk, will
you leave me? <hi>He anſwers,</hi> I know not how you may ſhift for your ſelf
by your Greatneſs; but be confident, they will never be at rest till they
have torn you from your Command; and what they will do with you
then, it concerns you to conſider; but for my ſelf, tho I am a poor Man
I will never put my ſelf into their Power, for I know it will not be for
my Safety. What, <hi>replies</hi> Monk <hi>haſtily,</hi> will you lay the Blame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me? If the Army will ſtick to me, I will ſtick by them. <hi>The Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
gave him Aſſurance</hi> they would, for the Danger was common to
them all: <hi>And ſuch a Joy among them hereupon ſucceeded, that
ſome expreſſed it with Tears.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'<hi>Twas ſaid, That</hi> Fleetwood <hi>was as fearful of</hi> Lambert <hi>upon this
Agreement, as</hi> Lambert <hi>was of</hi> Monk, <hi>in caſe he would not agree
to it.</hi> Monk <hi>therefore wrote to</hi> Fleetwood, That the News of a
Pacification was very agreeable to him, but that he found ſome things
doubtful in the Conditions, and other Matters not rightly tranſacted by
his Commiſſioners; that therefore, that the Agreement might be more
ſolid, he deſires the Number of the Commiſſioners might be encreaſed,
and <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> as a more proper place for the Meeting. Fleetwood
<hi>(tho diſſwaded from it by</hi> Whitlock <hi>and others) agrees to this,
and ſo does</hi> Lambert, <hi>whereby he did not ſhew himſelf a great
Stateſman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monk</hi> now reſolved not to ſubmit to this preſent <hi>Committee of
Safety</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> ſent Circular Letters to every Shire in <hi>Scotland</hi>
to ſend to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> two Commiſſioners, and to every Burrough
to ſend one; who met at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where they granted <hi>Monk
30000 l.</hi> Sterling above the Aſſeſſments, and proffered to aſſiſt
him with 20000 Men if he pleaſed: <hi>Monk</hi> accepts of the firſt, and
demurs upon the ſecond; but only deſired of them to take Care
in his Abſence that no Diſturbances ſhould be; and that they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
King <hi>Charles</hi> and his Intereſt. I know Dr. <hi>Gumble</hi> denies this
latter; yet I cannot believe the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Writers about this time,
<hi>viz.</hi> two or three Years after, ſhould ſo poſitively affirm this,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:60932:213"/>
which all <hi>Scotland</hi> muſt know to be a Lie, if it were not ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monk</hi> having obtained this Aid in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was Treaſon
to impoſe in <hi>England,</hi> by this time <hi>Lambert</hi> being come to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi>
ſent three Regiments of Horſe, and one of Dragoons, into
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> to ſeize on my Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Werk</hi>'s Rents; but
<hi>Monk</hi> prevented the Deſign, having before done the Work, and
carried the Money into <hi>Scotland;</hi> which Dr. <hi>Gumble</hi> ſays, was after
reſtored. Hereupon <hi>Monk</hi> ſeizes Colonel <hi>Zanchy</hi> (who was ſent
from <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> with Letters to proceed in an additional Treaty)
for Breach of certain preliminary Articles, one whereof was, <hi>That
no Forces on either ſide ſhould advance forward during the Time of the
Treaty:</hi> And now <hi>Monk</hi> advances to <hi>Coldſtream,</hi> a poor Place upon
the <hi>Tweed,</hi> and there pitches his Tents; where he received Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
that the Forces in <hi>Ireland</hi> had declared for <hi>Monk,</hi> and
ſuch as oppoſed his Deſigns were all ſecured. This was managed
by the Earls of <hi>Orrory</hi> and <hi>Montrath,</hi> Sir <hi>Theophilus Jones,</hi> the
<hi>Warrens,</hi> and Captain <hi>Fitz-Patrick</hi> (who after did the King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Service in ſecuring <hi>Dublin</hi> for him) and others. And ſure
it's obſervable, that as our Civil Wars began firſt from <hi>Scotland,</hi>
then from <hi>Ireland;</hi> ſo firſt from <hi>Scotland,</hi> then from <hi>Ireland,</hi>
ſhould ariſe that Peace which after ſucceeded in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rubicon</hi> thus paſſed, all Terms of Accommodation ceaſed;
<hi>Monk</hi>'s Army conſiſted of four Regiments of Horſe (and thoſe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
ones) commanded by <hi>Morgan, Johnſton, Knight,</hi> and <hi>Clober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
and ſix of Foot, commanded by Major-General <hi>Morgan,</hi> (whom
<hi>Lambert</hi> had ſent to treat with <hi>Monk) Fairfax, Rede, Lidcot,</hi> and
<hi>Hubblethorn. Monk</hi> had this Advantage of <hi>Lambert,</hi> That his Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
were well fed, and his Souldiers lay in Tents; whereas <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>'s
Horſe had nothing but what they plunder'd, and his Foot
were diſpers'd into Quarters where they could get them: And at
this rate <hi>Lambert</hi> came to <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe things were doing, all was in a Hurlyburly in

too, tho they would be glad of their Pay when they could
get it, yet agreed among themſelves, <hi>That their Officers might fight
with one another if they pleaſed, but the Souldiers would fight for none

                     <hi>Robinſon</hi> (after Sir <hi>John)</hi> Major-General <hi>Brown</hi> (after
Sir <hi>Richard)</hi> and ſome others, came to Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi> (then one
of the Commiſſioners of the Broad Seal) and propounded to him
to go to <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> to adviſe him to ſend to the King at <hi>Breda</hi> (it
ſhould have been to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> for the King came not to <hi>Breda</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was adviſed to it by <hi>Monk)</hi> and to offer to bring him in
upon good Terms, and thereby prevent <hi>Monk</hi>'s Deſigns; which
<hi>Whitlock</hi> did, as at the Deſire of them and Sir <hi>William Fleetwood</hi>
his elder Brother; and ſhewed <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> unleſs he did it, he and
all the <hi>Parliament-Party</hi> would be left at the Mercy of the King,
whom <hi>Monk</hi> would bring in without any Terms, as he after did.</p>
                  <p>Whitlock <hi>therefore propounded to</hi> Fleetwood <hi>one of theſe two
things;</hi> Either to give Order to all his Forces to draw together, and
himſelf and Friends to appear at the Head of them, and ſo get what
Strength they could that would ſtand by them; and accordingly to take
further Reſolutions, if they found their Strength but ſmall (which he
doubted;) then with thoſe few which he had; to go to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and
take Poſſeſſion of it; and to ſend to the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Common-Council</hi>
that he would join with them to declare for a Free Parliament; which
<hi>he thought</hi> the City would willingly do, and furniſh him with Money
for his Souldiers, which would encreaſe their Numbers.</p>
                  <p>Fleetwood <hi>asked him,</hi> If he would go with him into the Field, and to
the <hi>Tower?</hi> Whitlock <hi>ſaid,</hi> He would. <hi>Then</hi> Fleetwood <hi>asked him,</hi>
What was the other Way he had to propound to him in this Exigency?
he <hi>ſaid it was,</hi> That <hi>Fleetwood</hi> ſhould immediately ſend away ſome
Perſon of Trust to the King at <hi>Breda (Bruſſels)</hi> to offer to him his and
his Friends Service to the reſtoring the King to his Right, and that upon
ſuch Terms as the King ſhould agree upon; and for this purpoſe, to give
Inſtructions to the Party whom he ſhould ſend upon this Affair. Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
<hi>asked him,</hi> If he would be willing to go himſelf upon this Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<hi>who anſwered,</hi> He would, if <hi>Fleetwood</hi> thought good to ſend
him. <hi>With this, and ſome other Diſcourſe,</hi> Fleetwood <hi>ſeemed</hi> fully
ſatisfied to ſend <hi>Whitlock</hi> to the King, and deſired him to go and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
himſelf forthwith for the Journey; and that he and his Friends
would prepare Inſtructions for him, ſo that he might begin his Journey
this Evening, or early next Morning.</p>
                  <p>Whitlock <hi>going away, met</hi> Vane, Desborow, <hi>and</hi> Berry, <hi>coming
to ſpeak with</hi> Fleetwood; <hi>and about a quarter of an Hour after,</hi>
Fleetwood <hi>returned, and, in much Paſſion, told</hi> Whitlock, I cannot
do it, I cannot do it: <hi>who deſir'd his Reaſons;</hi> Fleetwood <hi>anſwered,</hi>
I am engaged not to do any ſuch thing without my Lord <hi>Lambert</hi>'s
Conſent: <hi>then</hi> Whitlock <hi>told him,</hi> You will ruin your ſelf and Friends.
<hi>See his</hi> Memoirs, <hi>fol.</hi> 692.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee how Man propoſes, but God diſpoſes: <hi>Monk</hi> that
made the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nobility abjure the King and his Intereſt, brought
him in; and <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> who would have done it, could not do it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="416" facs="tcp:60932:214"/>
                     <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and his <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> ſeeing all things now
deſperate, ſent a humble Meſſage to <hi>Lenthal</hi> to beſeech him and
the <hi>Rump,</hi> to take upon them the <hi>Supream Government</hi> again, which
they graciouſly accepted, but came ſtaggering into the Houſe,
being miſerably ſhaken by their Convulſion, tho it laſted not 2
Months, a ſhrewd Sign they were not long liv'd.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing the <hi>Rump</hi> did now they were out of their Fit,
was to recal <hi>Lambert</hi>'s and <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s Commiſſions, tho they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not have done it, for their Souldiers which before would not
fight for them, now would not keep them Company, but deſerted
them; ſo that their Conditions were right lamentable: <hi>Lambert</hi>
had no body to fight for him, nor <hi>Fleetwood</hi> ſcarce any to condole
with him in his preſent Solitudes: However, the <hi>Rump</hi> committed
<hi>Lambert</hi> to the Tower.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monk</hi> now having broken off the Treaty of Accommodation
with the <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> marches on, and is every day addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to, <hi>That the Nation might have a full and free Parliament;</hi>
yet every one underſtood what was intended by it: and at <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth</hi>
he met with a Letter from the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of
<hi>London,</hi> by their Sword-bearer, promiſing the Concurrence and
Aſſiſtance of the City in it: And that the End for which a <hi>Free
Parliament</hi> was to be called, was interpreted by hanging out the
King's Picture, which was no leſs gazed at by them, than by the
<hi>Welch-men</hi> at King <hi>Taffy</hi>'s Effigies at the <hi>Welch-Gate</hi> at <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Monk</hi> came into <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> at <hi>North-Allerton,</hi> he was met
by the Sheriff of the County, and at <hi>York</hi> he was magnificently
treated by the City, and careſſed by my Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Gentry; and here he received into his Service ſome of
<hi>Lambert</hi>'s Regiments, and ſent back Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi> into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> to keep all quiet there.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Rump</hi> were ſcarce recovered out of their Convulſion, when
they fell into a terrible <hi>Quotidian Ague,</hi> which ſhaked them grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly;
and yet could get no Phyſician which could adminiſter
any Comfort: They were ſure they were no way concerned in the
Nation's and City's Addreſſes to <hi>Monk for a Full and Free Parliament;</hi>
they could not truſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, nor would the Army truſt
them; all their Hopes were in <hi>Monk</hi> and his Army, yet were afraid
of them; and tho they were ſo, yet could not tell to whom they
ſhould complain.</p>
                  <p>However not to be utterly wanting to themſelves, they ſent
<hi>Luke Robiſon</hi> and <hi>Scot,</hi> to congratulate <hi>Monk</hi>'s coming, and thank
him for the <hi>Rump</hi>'s Recovery; but not to ſpeak one Word of the
Ague the <hi>Rump</hi> were fallen into.</p>
                  <p>Theſe met <hi>Monk</hi> at <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and did their Errand, but <hi>Monk</hi>
underſtood their Meaning, as well as they; and was as cloſe in
concealing his Intentions, as they were of their Errand; which was
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:60932:214"/>
to obſerve, and to be a Spy upon him in all his Motions: And
<hi>Monk</hi> ſo far complied, as at <hi>Northampton</hi> he made the Officers of
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Brigade abjure the King and his Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Monk</hi> came to St. <hi>Albans,</hi> he ſent to the <hi>Rump</hi> to turn all
thoſe treacherous Souldiers who had been ſo unfaithful to them,
out of the City and Lines of Communication; which the <hi>Rump</hi>
conſented to: and the Day after, the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> in a Military
Pomp, led his Army through <hi>London,</hi> and lodg'd in <hi>White-hall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Rump</hi>'s Frights were without end, for now they dreaded
the Return of <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> (ſo they call'd the King) more than
Sir <hi>G. Booth</hi>'s Inſurrection, or the Officers Rebellion; and ſince they
could not fight him unleſs <hi>Monk</hi> help them, they'll try to ſwear
him out, and ſee if <hi>Monk</hi> will join with them in it. And therefore
the <hi>Council of State,</hi> next Day after <hi>Monk</hi> came to <hi>White-hall,</hi> tender'd
him the Oath of <hi>Abjuring the King and Royal Family;</hi> which <hi>Monk</hi>
thought not fit then to do, but ſaid, <hi>He would conſider ſome time of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Day after, <hi>Monk,</hi> attended by <hi>Robiſon</hi> and <hi>Scot,</hi> went
to the Houſe, where the <hi>Speaker</hi> careſs'd him in a florid Speech,
congratulating his coming to Town; and in the Name of the
Houſe, thank'd him for the great Service he had done them. To
which <hi>Monk,</hi> in a plain Soldier-like Anſwer, ſaid,</p>
                  <p>That amongst the many Mercies of God to theſe poor Nations, their
Reſtitution was not the least; that it was his Work alone, and to him
belongs the Glory of it; that he eſteemed it an Effect of God's Goodneſs,
that he was ſome ways inſtrumental in it; wherein he did no more than
his Duty, which did not deſerve the high Mark of Favour they put upon
it: That he would trouble them with no large Narratives, yet deſired
leave to acquaint them, That in his March from <hi>Scotland</hi> he obſerved
the People in most Countries earneſtly deſired a Settlement for a full and
free Parliament; and that they would determine their Sitting, a Goſpel
Miniſtry, Encouragement for Learning in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities; and that
the <hi>Secluded Members</hi> before 1648, might be admitted without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Oaths.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That he had anſwered,</hi> They <hi>(the Rump)</hi> were a free Parliament,
and if there were any Force upon them, he would remove it; that you
would fill up your Houſe, and then would be a full Parliament; and that
you had already determined your Sitting. And for the Miniſtry and their
Maintenance, the Laws and Vniverſities, you had declared largely
concerning them in your last Declaration. That for the Gentlemen ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
before 1648, you had already given your Judgment, and that
they ought to acquieſce therein: but to admit <hi>Members</hi> to ſit without a
previous Oath, was never done in <hi>England:</hi> yet begg'd leave to ſay,
That the leſs Oaths and Engagements were impoſed, your Settlement
would be ſooner attained; yet that neither the <hi>Cavalier</hi> nor <hi>Fanatick</hi>
Party have any ſhare in the Civil or Military Power. <hi>Then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to them the State of</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>which you
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:60932:215"/>
may read at large in the third Part of Dr.</hi> Bates'<hi>s</hi> Elenchus.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Rump</hi> were as little pleaſed with <hi>Monk</hi>'s Speech, as the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of State</hi> with his Refuſal to take the Oath of <hi>Abjuring the King
and Royal Family;</hi> therefore, ſeeing he would not Swear as the <hi>Rump</hi>
would have him, they'll try if he will Do as they will have him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Common-Council</hi> in <hi>London</hi> had paſſed an Order, <hi>That unleſs
they had a full and free Parliament, they would pay no more Taxes.</hi> This
ſo ſtartled the <hi>Rump,</hi> that the next day after <hi>Monk</hi> had been at the
Houſe, they ſent to him to ſend 12 of the forwardeſt Citizens to the
<hi>Tower,</hi> and to pull up the City-Poſts, Chains, and Portcullices.</p>
                  <p>In Obedience to the <hi>Rump</hi>'s Order, <hi>Monk</hi> marches into the <hi>Old
Exchange,</hi> and ſecur'd as many of the Citizens the <hi>Rump</hi> ordered, as
he found there; but when he iſſued out his Orders to pull down
the Poſts, Chains, Gates, and Portcullices, the Officers withdrew,
and conſulted what to do; and reſolved, <hi>They could not obey theſe
Orders, and offered to lay down their Commiſſions. Monk</hi> endeavour'd
to pacify them; and told them, <hi>The Orders of the Council were to be
obeyed;</hi> but they perſiſted, ſo as he was forced to ſet his leſſer Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
to do the Work, but did not pull down the Gates and Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullices,
thinking he had done enough to ſatisfy the <hi>Rump,</hi> but was
miſtaken, for the <hi>Rump</hi> ſent more peremptory Orders, <hi>to pull down
the Gates and Portcullices;</hi> which piece of Drudgery <hi>Monk</hi> perform'd.</p>
                  <p>Col. <hi>Herb. Morley,</hi> a Non-Abjurer of the King, at this time was
Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and took this Occaſion to come to <hi>Monk,</hi>
and aſſured him for the <hi>Tower,</hi> himſelf, and Sir <hi>J. Fagg</hi> his Brother-in-law,
whoſe two Regiments were in <hi>London,</hi> and were reſolved to
agree with him in any Matters that ſhould be for the publick Peace
and Settlement. This was a Preparative to what followed; and that
Night <hi>Monk</hi> returned to <hi>White-hall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the next Day, or a Day after, <hi>Praiſe-God Barebone,</hi> with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Water-men and others (who it may be could neither write
nor read) preſented a Petition to the <hi>Rump, for the excluding the
King and Royal Family, and that thoſe who refuſed ſhould not be capable
of any Imployment:</hi> for which the <hi>Rump</hi> thank'd them; but the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
ſhall be no better than <hi>Richard</hi>'s 90 Congratulatory Addreſſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This ſtruck directly at the Authority of</hi> Monk: <hi>whereupon he
called a private Council of his Confidents, to adviſe what to do:
where it was reſolved to take a General Muſter of his Army in</hi>
Finsbury-fields <hi>the</hi> 11th <hi>of</hi> Febr. <hi>From whence</hi> Monk <hi>wrote to the</hi>
Rump, That the Services he had done them were ſlighted, whilſt the late
Traitors, no leſs Enemies to them than the Commonwealth, had more
Eſteem than he: From whence elſe was their Kindneſs to <hi>Lambert</hi>
and <hi>Vane,</hi> and new Offences against him, and their Reſpect to that
leering Heretick <hi>Barebone</hi> and all his Rabble? And therefore demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that the filling up their Members be within a Week, and their Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
determined, and to give place to a new Parliament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="419" facs="tcp:60932:215"/>
From <hi>Finsbury, Monk</hi> ſent to the Mayor, That he would dine
with him at the <hi>Bull-head</hi> in <hi>Cheapſide;</hi> where he deſired the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,
in the Evening to call a Court of Aldermen at <hi>Guild-hall.</hi> This
was blown about the City, and thouſands came to <hi>Guild-hall</hi> (and
I amongſt the reſt) to ſee what the Meaning of it ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>About ſix <hi>Monk</hi> came, and all the way as he came, and quite
through the Hall, the Cry was, <hi>A Free Parliament.</hi> I ſaw him when
he lighted out of his Coach, and went leaning on Col. <hi>Cloberry</hi>'s
Shoulder, into the Mayor's Court, but not one word he ſaid; and
when he came into the Mayor's Court, he read a Letter he ſent
that Morning to the <hi>Rump,</hi> and then returned: the Cry was the
ſame, <hi>A Free Parliament. Monk</hi> ſaid nothing; <hi>Cloberry</hi> ſaid, <hi>You
ſhall have a Free Parliament.</hi> And it's not to be imagin'd, how
far this ſpread in ſo little time; for, I believe, in leſs than 2 Hours
all the Bells of <hi>London</hi> were ringing; and in all the Streets (to the
number, 'twas ſaid, of above 6000) Bonfires were made, and
<hi>Rumps</hi> of all ſorts roaſting. But that Night <hi>Monk</hi> did not return to
<hi>White-hall,</hi> but lay at the <hi>Glaſs-houſe</hi> in <hi>Broadſtreet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Rump</hi> were nettled at <hi>Monk</hi>'s Speech, they were now
ready to die for fear; but ſince they could not ſhew their Teeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they would ſhew their Back-ſides, and voted <hi>a Committee of Five;</hi>
to order the Affairs of the Army, whereof <hi>Monk</hi> to be one.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Monk,</hi> who but 4 Days before was ſo terrible to the City, is
now become their Darling; they let him have 30000 <hi>l.</hi> to pay his
Army in the City; whereas that without, <hi>was like a Herd of Goats
upon the Mountains, having no body to look after them, nor a Penny to
help themſelves.</hi> And <hi>Monk</hi> now having his Army entirely at his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
ſcorn'd, for all the <hi>Rump</hi>'s Vote, to ſuffer any other of their
Committee to partake with him in any part of his Authority over it.</p>
                  <p>And now <hi>Monk,</hi> with a better Authority, and more Applauſe than
<hi>Cromwel</hi> had, might have ſet up himſelf for <hi>Protector,</hi> or what he
pleas'd; but he ſaw the Genius of the Nation lay another way, and
that 'twas more ſecure to follow it, than to ſet up himſelf againſt it.</p>
                  <p>He held therefore private Intelligence with the Heads of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
Members about their Reſtoration on certain Conditions: The
Secluded Members were zealouſly diſpoſed to out the <hi>Rump</hi> upon
any Terms, whatever came of it; they had more to ſay againſt the
<hi>Rump,</hi> than the <hi>Rump</hi> had againſt the Officers of the Army, who
had twice depoſed them; and the <hi>Rump</hi> began the Game with the
Secluded Members before the Officers began with them. So upon
<hi>Feb. 21. Monk</hi> gave the Command of the Guard to Sir <hi>Anthony Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
Cooper</hi> (after Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury)</hi> to permit the Secluded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to enter the Houſe; the firſt whereof was <hi>W. Prynn,</hi> tied to
a great Basket-hilted Sword: yet the <hi>Rumpers</hi> were not excluded,
nor did the Secluded Members care for it, being four to one. And
ſo the <hi>Rumpers</hi> left the Houſe, and fell into a Relapſe of their
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:60932:216"/>
Convulſion, out of which they never recovered: nor did <hi>Barebone</hi>'s
Rabble afford them any Relief.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the <hi>Rump</hi> and Secluded Members were like <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-Jacks</hi>
too, when one was up, the other was down; for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
Members, who before would not have the Nation or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſafe, unleſs they were an Undiſſolvable Parliament, now,
to be revenged on the <hi>Rump,</hi> are content to meet only to do <hi>Monk</hi>
ſome Journey-work, and then diſſolve themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The Secluded Members, after they were in, repeal their own
Excluſion; then vote <hi>Monk</hi> General of all the Forces in <hi>England,
Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland; Mountague,</hi> Admiral of the Fleet; ſet Sir
<hi>George Booth,</hi> and thoſe in Priſon upon that account, at liberty;
and ſoon after ſent <hi>Lambert</hi> in his room; and grant a Tax for Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Army, which now no Man diſputed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> Monk'<hi>s Cares did not end here; the Army without were
more than fivefold to his within the City: he therefore ſent Letters
to all the other Regiments of the Armies in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland,
To certify the Reaſon of the re-admiſſion of the Secluded Members, that
without it there was no way to ſatisfy the Nation, or raiſe Money to pay
the Army; and with large Aſſurances of their Conſtancy in their old
Profeſſion and Principles.</p>
                  <p>The Souldiers in general were glad to be out of their ſtarving
and wandring ſtate, and therefore in ſhoals ſubmitted to <hi>Monk,</hi>
who yet would not receive them, unleſs they would ſwear to be
true to this Parliament (as 'twas called) which he could but little
truſt to, they having ſo often forſwore themſelves before; yet theſe
at preſent ſerv'd his turn, and thoſe who refus'd he caſhier'd.</p>
                  <p>Now had horrible Dread overwhelm'd the <hi>Rumpers,</hi> eſpecially the
<hi>Regicides;</hi> they ſaw themſelves hated by almoſt all the Nation, yet
at irreconcilable Variance one with another; the Body of the Army
which had raiſed them, turned now againſt them: they knew the
Secluded Members had but a limited time to ſit, and then to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
themſelves to make room for another, which would certainly
bring in the King, to their utter Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>In this Conſternation, <hi>Lambert</hi> eſcap'd out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and Col.
<hi>Rich</hi> refuſed to ſubmit: <hi>Lambert</hi> poſts to <hi>Warwick,</hi> where he met
<hi>Axtel, Okey, Cobbet, Creed,</hi> and ſome other disbanded Officers, to
whom many disbanded Soldiers joined, which made up a little Army.</p>
                  <p>Colonel <hi>Streater</hi> (a Confident of <hi>Monk</hi>'s) from <hi>Northampton,</hi> gives
<hi>Monk</hi> an Account of this; whereupon the <hi>Council of State,</hi> ſettled
by the Secluded Members, proclaim <hi>Lambert</hi> and all his Adherents
Traitors; and <hi>Monk</hi> ſent Col. <hi>Rich. Ingoldsby</hi> (a Gentleman of more
true Courage than 20 of theſe ſniveling Fellows, who was before ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhier'd
for adhering to <hi>Ric. Cromwel,</hi> when the Officers depos'd him)
with a ſtrong Squadron of Horſe, to join <hi>Streater</hi>'s Foot, againſt them.</p>
                  <p>When theſe were joined, upon <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi> near <hi>Daventry,</hi> both
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:60932:216"/>
Armies came within ſight of one another; when <hi>Lambert</hi> made an
Overture to <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> to reſtore <hi>Ric. Cromwel:</hi> but <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> knew
this Game was loſt, and that <hi>Lambert</hi> did not mean ſincerely; and
ſo they fought. <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> charged home, and <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Men could
not ſuſtain the Shock, but fled; and <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> (it's ſaid) took <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
Priſoner with his own hands, <hi>Lambert</hi> crying, <hi>Quarter, good my
Lord</hi> (for <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> was one of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Lords of the <hi>other Houſe) ſpare
my Life.</hi> With <hi>Lambert, Cobbet</hi> and <hi>Creed</hi> were taken Priſoners; <hi>Okey</hi>
and <hi>Axtel</hi> eſcaped now, but could not eſcape a greater Puniſhment
than befel <hi>Lambert, Cobbet,</hi> or <hi>Creed,</hi> for they were hang'd and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
for having been K. <hi>Charles</hi>'s Judges. Nor was <hi>Rich</hi>'s Fate much
better than <hi>Lambert</hi>'s, for Col. <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> at <hi>Bury</hi> in <hi>Suffolk</hi> caſhier'd
him, it's ſaid, at the Head of his Regiment, and disbanded it.</p>
                  <p>This was the End of that Invincible Army, ſubdu'd by not one
<hi>6th</hi> part of it ſelf; for <hi>Monk,</hi> when he came from <hi>Scotland,</hi> had but
4 Regiments of Horſe, and 6 of Foot, and (I believe) not 10 Men
killed in their Defence; and not one <hi>in the Reduction of the invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Armado.</hi> And now 'tis time to ſee what followed; the Secluded
Members, with much ado, having diſſolved themſelves, upon <hi>Mar.</hi> 17.
iſſued out Writs for another to meet, yet in the Name of <hi>the Keepers
of the Liberties of the Commonwealth of</hi> England, <hi>upon</hi> Apr. 25. the
Elections to be as they were before the Year 1640. The gazing
World eagerly expected the Succeſs of this wondrous Revolution.</p>
                  <p>If we look abroad, we ſhall ſee <hi>Mazarine,</hi> after <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Death,
not foreſeeing wherein the Confuſions and Diſorders in <hi>England</hi>
would end, unleſs in the <hi>Reſtoring the King</hi> (which, by Monſieur
<hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador in <hi>England,</hi> he diligently uſed his
utmoſt Endeavours to prevent) now ſets up a <hi>Treaty of Peace</hi> with
<hi>Spain,</hi> and to forward it, propounds a Marriage between the <hi>French</hi>
King and the eldeſt <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> the younger was after mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the now Emperor <hi>Leopold,</hi> and the now King of <hi>Spain</hi> not
born. This Treaty was called <hi>The Pyrenaean Treaty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as this Treaty was made in deepeſt Diſſimulation and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
ſo were the Preparations to it; for at the ſame time (the War
continuing between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal)</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King made an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
League with <hi>Portugal</hi> for 10 Years, not to treat with <hi>Spain,</hi>
unleſs the <hi>Portugueſe were entirely ſatisfied in all their exorbitant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of</hi> Spain; in which 'twas agreed, <hi>That all the Harbours the</hi>
Portugueſe <hi>ſhould take in</hi> Spain, <hi>either upon the one or other ſide of the
Sea, ſhall be put into the Power of</hi> France: which you may read in the
moſt excellent Treatiſe of the truly honourable and learned Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
the Baron <hi>d' Iſola, Of the Buckler of State and Juſtice,</hi> Chap. 1.
And in regard there is ſo great a Connexion of the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with that of the Life of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. we'll be more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
in it before we enter on the other.</p>
                  <p>The Baron, in the <hi>2d</hi> Article or Chapt. ſays, the moving Cauſe of
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:60932:217"/>
                     <hi>the Peace was,</hi> The Deſire of the Good, Quiet, and Eaſe of the Subjects of
both Kings. <hi>The Object was,</hi> To put a period to ſo many Miſchiefs; <hi>the
Effect,</hi> To forget and extinguiſh all the Cauſes and Motives of the Wars
paſt, and to eſtabliſh a ſincere, entire, and durable Peace between the
Kings and their Succeſſors. <hi>For attaining theſe</hi> Ends, <hi>the</hi> Spaniard <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
that theſe</hi> Points <hi>were neceſſary,</hi> viz. The <hi>Infanta</hi>'s diſclaiming
all her Right and Title to the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> or any of its Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould not directly or indirectly aſſist the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi>
in their War against <hi>Spain; and by the by,</hi> That the Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> ſhould be reſtored to all the Eſtate and Governments he enjoyed
before he joined with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> againſt <hi>Mazarine</hi> and his Faction;
and that the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> ſhould be reſtored to his Dutchy, with all the
places which he had poſſeſt in the Biſhopricks of <hi>Metz, Toul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Articles of the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s Renunciation were ſoon agreed to
reciprocally, but that of abandoning the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſtuck at preſent,
the <hi>French</hi> having ſo lately made an <hi>Offenſive League</hi> with the Prince
Regent: And that the Treaty might be agreed without the <hi>French</hi>
abandoning of <hi>Portugal,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> proffered the <hi>Reſtitution of all the
Places conquered from</hi> Spain <hi>during the War</hi> (but promiſed more than
they could perform, for <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and <hi>Mardike</hi> were not in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er)
<hi>and alſo other Countries, and entirely to reſtore the Prince of</hi> Conde.</p>
                  <p>But without abandoning <hi>Portugal</hi> nothing was to be done, and ſo the
<hi>French</hi> King did promiſe and oblige himſelf, upon his Honour, and in the
Faith and Word of a King, for himſelf and his Succeſſors, not to meddle
any more in the Affair of <hi>Portugal;</hi> nor to give to it, either in general,
or to any Perſon or Perſons of it in particular, of what Eſtate, Dignity or
Condition, at preſent or hereafter, any Aid or Aſſiſtance, publick or ſecret,
directly or indirectly, of Men, Arms, Ammunition, Victuals, Ships, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
under any Pretext, nor of any thing that is or can be by Land or
Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or any other faſhion; nor permit any Levy to be made in any part
of his Dominions; nor grant free Paſſage to thoſe who ſhall come out of
other Countries; which ſhall come to help the Realm of <hi>Portugal. And
was ſigned by the King,</hi> Mazarine, <hi>Clergy and Nobility of</hi> France.</p>
                  <p>Towards the End of this Treaty, K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. about the End of
<hi>November</hi> (the Differences between <hi>Monk</hi> and the Officers of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Army being in the higheſt Ferment) came to it, that his
Concerns might be concerted in it; he was received by <hi>Don Lewis
de Haro</hi> (that <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſter) with as much Honour and Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as if poſſeſt of all his Kingdoms, but negligently and ſlightly
by <hi>Mazarine</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters: And ſure the Indignity here
offer'd to his Perſon, and the Induſtry of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> in
endeavouring to keep him from being reſtor'd, would have made
another not to forget theſe about 5 or 6 Months after. But if the
King's Reſtoration came not from ſome other place, he might have
waited long enough for it here; for <hi>France</hi> would not, and <hi>Spain</hi>
could not aſſiſt him.</p>

                  <p>AS the Nation thought they could not be redeemed from
the Arbitrary Government of King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, but
by the Long Parliament it 1640, ſo they thought they
could not be redeemed from the Confuſions, Rage and
Diſtractions they labour'd now under, but by reſtoring King <hi>Charles</hi>
the Second.</p>
                  <p>To gratify this Expectation, the Convention who met on the
<hi>25th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1660, Hand over Head, without any Preliminaries
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:60932:218"/>
of aſſerting the Rights and Liberties of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſo manifeſtly
violated by his Father and Grandfather, reſtored the King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Contradiction.</p>
                  <p>Upon his Reſtoration there were but five of the Biſhops living,
<hi>viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Juxton,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London;</hi> Dr. <hi>Fruin,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter;</hi>
Dr. <hi>Wren,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely;</hi> Dr. <hi>Warner,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter;</hi> and
Dr. <hi>King,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter:</hi> Theſe three latter lived to die in
their Biſhopricks, and in the Interval between the beginning of
the Long Parliament, and the Reſtoration of the King (near
twenty Years) upon the matter, all theſe Leaſes of the Church
were expired, whereby incredible Sums of Money were raiſed
by the new-promoted Biſhops to their vacant Sees, without
any regard to the reſt of the poor ſequeſtred Clergy, their Wives
or Children: But the Jollity of the Convention for having got
their King, put ſuch mean Thoughts out of their Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>The Hopes of the happy Days to come under this King's Reign,
quite blotted out their Remembrance of the Days of his Father's
and Grand-father's Reign: On the contrary, to flatter him, they
ſtiled his Father, <hi>The Martyr for the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Church and State.</hi>
Now they had got him they would hold him, he might do what
he liſt for all them, and ſo he did; which the Nation ſubmitted
to, rather than return to the Confuſions and Diſorders of the Times
after his Father's Death: Nay, the Memory of theſe Times was
ſo odious, that if even the Parliament took notice of his Actions,
his Flatterers charged them with returning to the Parliament in
1640.</p>
                  <p>The Convention took terrible Vengeance on his Father's Judges;
for tho they did not all ſuffer in their Perſons, ſcarce any of them
but forfeited their Eſtates: So as theſe Men who would have his
Father's Life, and Crown-Lands for their Eſtates, loſt their own
Lives, and had their Eſtates added to the Revenues of the Crown:
tho this was but as Water poured into a Sive, yet it's obſervable,
that the Inſtruments who acted in the King's Death ſhould be thus
puniſhed, and <hi>Lenthal</hi> the Speaker, who granted the Commiſſion
to act, ſhould eſcape free.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were ſcarce wet with the Tail of this Storm,
none of them (except thoſe in ſequeſtred Livings) being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
either in their Perſons or Fortunes; and many of them
were preferred in high Places both in Church and State.</p>
                  <p>The poor Cavalier, or Loyal ſuffering Party, who hoped for a
Heaven upon Earth in this King's Reign, fell into a worſe State
that that they were in before: For as <hi>Meſſeray</hi> ſaid of the Reign
of <hi>Henry</hi> III. of <hi>France, It was the Reign of Favourites, wherein
the Subjects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> (it's ſaid) <hi>paid ſo much, yet never was any King ſo poor:</hi>
So it may be ſaid of this. And the Cavalier Party having before
mortgaged their Eſtates to redeem their Sequeſtration, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:60932:218"/>
paid the Taxes to the King, and the other Part the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
to the Mortgage; nor were they any ways countenanced by
the King.</p>
                  <p>For his Favourite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were a Generation of People who knew not
his Father, but who humoured him in his Senſual Pleaſures and
Prodigality; and were of the Female as well as Male Sex; who
were a ſort of Favourites his Father was not acquainted with, nor
do I find he ever regarded the Memory of his Father; but that
he induſtriouſly endeavour'd to have it believed, the Portraiture
of his Father's Sufferings, a Book of late ſo much controverted,
was none of his.</p>
                  <p>However, his Mother had a great Aſcendant over him, ſo that
ſhe being a Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> inclin'd him to embrace the <hi>French</hi>
Intereſt againſt his own: And ſhe living near ten Years after his
Reſtoration, ſo fixed this into a Habit in him, that in all his Life
after he could never get rid of it, notwithſtanding all the Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of the <hi>French</hi> King to the contrary. But it's time now to
take a View of this King's Actions.</p>
                  <p>The Deſires of the King to be reſtor'd were no leſs than thoſe
of the Nation, that he ſhould, tho upon any Terms; for upon
the Diſſolution of the ſecluded Members, the King left <hi>Bruſſels</hi> (as
you'll ſoon ſee he left <hi>Spain,</hi> who had harboured and relieved him
in the time of his Exile, to join with <hi>France,</hi> who had expell'd him
to join with <hi>Oliver,</hi> and by its Ambaſſador <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> at this time
was uſing all its Endeavours to keep him out) and came to <hi>Breda,</hi>
from whence he ſent Letters by Sir <hi>John Greenvile</hi> (after Earl of
<hi>Bath)</hi> to <hi>Monk, Mountague,</hi> (after Earl of <hi>Sandwich)</hi> and the
Mayor of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who thought to have had the ſame Power
they had when the ſecluded Members diſſolved themſelves, were
ſhrewdly miſtaken, for the Body of the Commons were <hi>Royaliſts,</hi>
who choſe Sir <hi>Harbottle Grimſton</hi> their Speaker, and upon the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Convention, the <hi>Royaliſt</hi> Lords, double more than the
<hi>Presbyterians,</hi> entred into the Lords Houſe, which the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
complained of to <hi>Monk,</hi> who anſwer'd, <hi>Now they were in, he had no
Power to turn them out;</hi> ſo the <hi>Royaliſts</hi> were double to the Factions
in both Houſes of this Convention, ſo as the King need not fear
his Reſtoration.</p>
                  <p>Now half <hi>England,</hi> of all ſorts (except the <hi>Rumpers)</hi> croſs the
Seas to <hi>Breda,</hi> to make their Bargains with the King before he
ſhould come into <hi>England:</hi> the King promiſes fair to all, which it
may be was impoſſible to perform, which cauſed Murmur after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
And the Convention after they had proclaimed him King
by inherent Birth-right, ſent him 50000 <hi>l. 10000 l.</hi> to the Duke
of <hi>York,</hi> and 5000 <hi>l.</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter;</hi> and the City of
<hi>London</hi> ſent the King and his Brothers 12000 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="426" facs="tcp:60932:219"/>
Upon the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> both Houſes ſent Commiſſioners to <hi>Breda,</hi>
to invite the King to return, and Admiral <hi>Mountague</hi> with a Royal
Fleet to convoy him over, who upon the <hi>25th</hi> landed him at <hi>Dover,</hi>
where <hi>Monk</hi> met him upon his Knees, the King embracing him and
kiſſing him, and next day at <hi>Canterbury</hi> created him Knight of the
Garter, the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter</hi> putting the <hi>George</hi> about
his Neck.</p>
                  <p>'Twas rather a Madneſs than Jollity, all ſorts of People ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the King's Paſſage from <hi>Dover</hi> to <hi>White-hall.</hi> The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was never ſo fine in Cloths, even the poor Cavaliers will be
as fine as the beſt, tho they never live to pay their Tailors; nor
ſhall the King take any care of them, his Favourites being of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Stamp than thoſe who ſerved his Father: Never were ſuch
Pageants, Triumphal Arches, and ſumptuous Feaſts ſeen in the
City before; for which the poor Orphans Money in the Chamber
of <hi>London</hi> muſt pay the greateſt part.</p>
                  <p>When the King was reſtor'd, the Nation was in a Martial Poſture,
and the Manners of the People generally more ſevere and ſober,
than in his Father's and Grand-father's Reigns.</p>
                  <p>The firſt that made Court to the King were the <hi>Dutch,</hi> when he
was at <hi>Breda,</hi> to enter into a League with them; but the King, by
the Advice of Sir <hi>Edward Hide,</hi> (it's ſaid) wiſely anſwered, <hi>That
this would look as if 'twere done by Reſtraint, the King being in their
Power; beſides, he was not yet poſſeſt of his Kingdoms, nor had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed his Privy-Council:</hi> Yet the <hi>Dutch</hi> were the firſt who ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs'd
him with a moſt rich and ſplendid Gilded Yatch, to prepare
him for a Treaty after his Acceſſion to his Crowns.</p>
                  <p>Nor were the reſt of the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> long after the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in
congratulating the King's Reſtoration, the <hi>French</hi> King being one
of the firſt: The <hi>Spaniard</hi> made not ſo much haſte, yet hoped for
a better Reception than the <hi>French;</hi> and that the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
might have a better Reception, he ſent the Prince <hi>de Ligny</hi> his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,
who in the Splendor of his Train much outvied the <hi>French.</hi>
It's true, the Prince got a Peace with the King for his Maſter the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> but he got as little good by it, as the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
did by that he made with the King's Grand-father, King <hi>James</hi>
the Firſt.</p>
                  <p>With better Succeſs came the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, tho I do not
find he made any League with the <hi>French</hi> againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> as
<hi>Oliver</hi> did; nor was there any need of it, the <hi>French</hi> having made
a deceitful Peace with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> at the <hi>Pyrenaean Treaty,</hi> yet you
ſhall ſoon ſee both Kings dealt as ill with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as if
he had been an open Enemy: And the more to endear himſelf
with his Brother of <hi>France,</hi> the King rejected the advantagious
Treaty of Commerce which <hi>Oliver</hi> made with <hi>France,</hi> as done by
an Uſurper, and never after (at leaſt that I ever heard of) made
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:60932:219"/>
any other inſtead of it, but left his Subjects to be uſed even as the
<hi>French</hi> King pleaſed in their Trades to <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh was the firſt of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings who uſed
Guards, and he ſet up the Yeomen of the Guard, which was
followed by all the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ſince: but tho the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had paid off and disbanded the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Armies, yet the King
beſides his Band of Penſioners, in imitation of the <hi>French,</hi> muſt
have Guards of Horſe and Foot, and the Parliament gave him
Revenue enough to encreaſe theſe to what Number he pleaſed:
But it had been better for him if he had imitated the <hi>French</hi> too,
in preferring Men who were qualified, but few of theſe were to
be found there: And tho he gave near double the Pay to theſe,
yet was he much worſe ſerved than if Men of Merit had been
there for half the Pay; for ſcarce one of the Officers but bought
their Places; and this was ſo common, that the Prices were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
ſo not he who deſerved, but he which gave moſt was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred;
and when he was in, he owed the King no Service, having
paid for what he had; and ſo his Buſineſs was how to improve
his Bargain, not ſerve the King. And herein too the poor Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers
had the worſt, they not having ſo much Money to buy as
others had.</p>
                  <p>I take it for granted, that the firſt League which the now <hi>French</hi>
King made after he came to Majority (I mean after twenty one
Years of Age) was that of the <hi>Pyrenaean Treaty,</hi> the Breach of all
the reſt before we will lay to the Charge of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine:</hi>
We will therefore ſee if the <hi>French</hi> King was not as little a Slave
to his Word in this League, as <hi>Mazarine</hi> was in any before; and
you'll ſee that in all the Leagues this King after made, he was as
little a Slave to his Word as in this Treaty.</p>
                  <p>We have in the former Book ſet down particularly the Article
whereby the <hi>French</hi> King, upon his Honour, and the Faith and
Word of a King, did promiſe neither directly nor indirectly
to aſſiſt <hi>Portugal</hi> againſt <hi>Spain;</hi> yet at the beginning of the Treaty
they ſecretly conveyed Troops into <hi>Portugal</hi> in ſeveral Bodies:
And when upon Complaint of the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente,</hi> they
ſent publick Orders to the Governours of their Ports, not to ſuffer
any Souldiers to embark for <hi>Portugal,</hi> they did not abſtain by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance
under-hand to let them paſs. Nay, when Marſhal <hi>Turene</hi>
made publick Levies to aſſiſt <hi>Portugal,</hi> it being complained of by
the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente,</hi> they anſwered, it was a particular Act
of the Marſhal, and the Court of <hi>France</hi> had no Hand in it. And
alſo continually ſupplied <hi>Portugal</hi> with Corn, and all ſorts of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition:
And <hi>France</hi> alſo fomented the Obſtinacy of <hi>Portugal</hi> to
continue the War, when <hi>Spain</hi> offered them advantagious Terms of
Peace. This, and much more you may read in the ſecond Article of
<hi>The Buckler of State and Juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>

Nor did the <hi>French</hi> King ſtay here, but (being become the
deareſt Confident with his Brother of <hi>England)</hi> almoſt as ſoon as
the King was ſettled, the <hi>French</hi> ſent Monſieur <hi>Courtin</hi> to move
the King not to abandon <hi>Portugal;</hi> nor did he yet ſtay here, but
<hi>Mazarine</hi> dying much about the latter end of Summer, having a
Stone in his Heart, (ſo the <hi>French Paſquils</hi> ſaid) in <hi>September</hi> or

treat with her Son for a Marriage between Monſieur of <hi>France,</hi> and
her fair Daughter <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> the King's beloved Siſter:
Yet it ſeems to me the Marriage of the King with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of

                  <p>As the Deſigns of the Queen's coming over were dark, ſo I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
I have not ſeen any of the Treaties or Tranſactions
concerning them, but muſt take Meaſures by what followed, and
ſo far as I had Light from what went before; yet in all of them
it ſeems evident to me, that the Queen ſhewed her ſelf to be more
affectionate to her Daughter than Son, and to be more a Daughter
of <hi>France,</hi> than Queen of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before I proceed, it will be convenient to take notice of
the deplorable State of <hi>Spain,</hi> which their Ambition in ſeeking ſo
many Foreign Dominions, and a Tyrannical Government had
brought it to: For before the Acceſſion of their <hi>American</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
which they acquired by unjuſt War, and unheard-of Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in all the ten Years War between <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> with
the <hi>Moors</hi> (who had ſeven hundred Years been poſſeſſed of the
Kingdoms of <hi>Granada, Murcia,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Andaluzia)</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Year the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> brought near a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Men into the Field to fight one with another; yet the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of <hi>Arragon, Navar</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> were Neutral in all the
War: Whereas now all the Kingdoms of <hi>Spain</hi> (except that of
<hi>Portugal)</hi> were united under this King <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth, yet out
of them all he could not raiſe an Army to fight the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi>
but truſting to the <hi>French</hi> Faith in the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Treaty, ſent the
Army in <hi>Flanders</hi> under the Command of the Marqueſs <hi>Caracene</hi> to
do it.</p>
                  <p>The King imbraced the Overtures of both Marriages; and now
the <hi>French</hi> King doubly, if not trebly, aſſured of his Brother of
<hi>England,</hi> as well by the Treaties of theſe Marriages as by his Meſſage
by <hi>Courtin,</hi> no longer acts covertly in aſſiſting the Prince Regent
of <hi>Portugal</hi> againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> but bare-fac'd ſent Marſhal <hi>Schomberg</hi>
with an Army and Fleet to their Aſſiſtance, yet this Army was not
ſufficient to make an Offenſive War againſt <hi>Spain;</hi> but <hi>Portugal</hi>
ſtood only upon the Defenſive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="429" facs="tcp:60932:220"/>
The Want of Money a little retarded the Marriage of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
with <hi>Monſieur;</hi> but this might be eaſily help'd, if the King
would give up <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> whereby he might pay
200000 <hi>l.</hi> for his Siſter's Portion (which was more than his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had with his Mother) and alſo receive 200000 <hi>l.</hi> more for
himſelf. Nor was this all, he might ſave the Charges of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a Gariſon there; yet the Parliament in the Hereditary
Exciſe, allowed him 60000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> for the Support of it.
I do not find this mentioned in the Body of the Act, yet ſeveral
Members aſſured me, it was ſo intended in the paſſing the Act.</p>
                  <p>All this the King agreed to, and ſo <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and <hi>Mardike</hi> Fort
were given up to the <hi>French,</hi> againſt all the Laws of <hi>Humanity,
Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Prudence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay it was againſt all the Laws of <hi>Humanity;</hi> for the <hi>Spaniard</hi>
entertained and relieved the King, when the <hi>French</hi> had expelled
him, and joined with <hi>Oliver</hi> the Uſurper of all his Dominions.
It was againſt <hi>Juſtice;</hi> for the Soveraignty of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was of Right
and Juſtice the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> And againſt the Rules of <hi>Policy</hi> and
<hi>Prudence;</hi> the <hi>French Nation</hi> being the Natural Enemies of the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the next Neighbour to it, and of all Nations the moſt
formidable.</p>
                  <p>It had been happier for the poor <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Nation, if the Unkindneſs of the King to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had ended
in his giving up <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to the <hi>French:</hi> but it ended not here;
for the King imployed the Army which ſhould have kept <hi>Dunkirk</hi>
againſt the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in <hi>Portugal;</hi> and with theſe and another Band
of the disbanded <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army joined to them; the <hi>French, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi>
and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or rather the <hi>Engliſh</hi> without them, routed
the whole united Army of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> at the Fight of <hi>Elvas:</hi> So
as now the <hi>French</hi> had a new Inlet into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniard</hi>
no Army to defend it. This was a foul Blot in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
by their King's truſting to the Faith of his Brethren of
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> But this will not ſtay here, as hereafter you
will ſee.</p>
                  <p>Here I take leave ſo well as I can, to vindicate the Memory of
my Lord Chancellor <hi>Hide,</hi> from two Aſperſions (as I conceive)
caſt upon him; one, That he was the Adviſer of the giving up
<hi>Dunkirk</hi> to the <hi>French:</hi> The other, That he was the Procurer of
the King's Marriage with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt, I was aſſured by a credible Perſon (tho a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of my Lord Chancellor's) that he was ſo far from adviſing
the King to give up <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> that only he and my
Lord Treaſurer <hi>Southampton</hi> (upon whoſe Honour my Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
relied more than any other) of all the Council, entred
their Proteſtations againſt it. The Truth of this may be reſolved,
by inſpecting the Privy-Council's Books.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="430" facs="tcp:60932:221"/>
It's true, I cannot prove negatively, that my Lord Chancellor
did not firſt propound the King's Marriage with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of
<hi>Portugal;</hi> yet it ſeems to me reaſonable he did not, for theſe
Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>I never heard of any Diſcourſe of this Match, before the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of the Queen-Mother in <hi>England;</hi> or if any were, it's probable
that Monſieur <hi>Courtin</hi> had this in his Inſtructions, as well as that
of moving the King not to abandon <hi>Portugal,</hi> for both theſe tend
to the ſame end; and the <hi>French</hi> King, all his Reign after, ſought
to attain his Ends by Women, as well as other Ways: Nor can it
be believed that the Prince of <hi>Portugal,</hi> now engaged in War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Spain,</hi> ſhould pay the Queen's Portion 400000 <hi>l.</hi> I believe
he did what he could, give up <hi>Tangier</hi> and <hi>Bombay</hi> to the King,
which laſt Place he leaſed to the <hi>Eaſt-India Company</hi> for 10 <hi>l. per
Annum,</hi> but the Money was paid by the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
                  <p>Though the Factions had ſuch ill Succeſs with previous Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which every one impoſed upon the Nation when it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt,
and which no Man regarded when another ſucceeded;
yet upon the Reſtoration of the King, the Oaths of Allegiance and
Supremacy (which latter was only impoſed upon certain Sorts of
Men; and, as my Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> ſays, ſinks deep into the Conſcience,
and was therefore interpreted by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in her Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which were after confirmed by Act of Parliament) were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon all ſorts of People, and the Refuſers looked upon as
Enemies to the King, and Favourers of the late Times.</p>
                  <p>And tho the Convention ſate but from the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1660,
to the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> following, yet by this time the outward
Face of almoſt all the Nation was quite changed; the <hi>Cavalier
Party,</hi> under the Perſecution of the late times, lived quietly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that part of their Eſtates which was permitted them after their
Compoſitions, and the Governing Factions put on a Countenance
of Godlineſs and Sobriety; whereas in the Jollity of the King's
Reſtoration, all ſorts of Men (even the Factions) endeavoured to
imitate the profuſe Prodigality and Luxury of the Court; which
ſcarce entertained any but upon thoſe Terms. To humour the King,
the Publick Theaters were ſtuffed with moſt Obſcene Actions and
Interludes, and the more Obſcene pleaſed the King the better, who
graced the opening of them with his Preſence, at the firſt Notice
of a new Play.</p>
                  <p>In this State the Convention was diſſolved, and a Parliament
met the eighth of <hi>May,</hi> 1661. where that they might outvy the
Convention in Loyalty, in the firſt Chapter they make Words to
compaſs or imagine any Bodily Harm, Impriſonment, or Reſtraint
upon the Body of the King, or to Depoſe him, or levy War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, to be High-Treaſon: And if any ſhall any ways affirm
the King to be a <hi>Heretick</hi> or <hi>Papiſt,</hi> ſhall be incapacitated to hold
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:60932:221"/>
any Eccleſiaſtical, Civil or Military Imployment: And that it
ſhall be a <hi>Premunire</hi> in any to ſay, The Long Parliament begun in
<hi>November</hi> 1640 is not diſſolved; or that there lies any Obligation
upon any one from any Oath to endeavour a Change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
either in Church or State; or that one or both Houſes of
Parliament have a Legiſlative Power: and declare the Oath, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>The Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> to be an unlawful
Oath, and impoſed upon the Subject againſt the Fundamental
Laws and Conſtitutions of the Nation: And Chap. 5. declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Tumultuary petitioning the King or Parliament: And Chap.
6. declare the ſole Right of the Militia to be in the King. This
Parliament, upon the thirtieth of <hi>July,</hi> was adjourned to the
twentieth of <hi>November.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This being but an Adjournment, and ſo the Act of the Houſes,
(for as yet the King did not exerciſe his Prerogative of Proroguing
them, which hereafter you will ſee him very prodigal of) I do
not find that this Adjournment was made, that the King might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
proceed in his Bargain and Sale of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to the <hi>French.</hi> Yet
I do ſay that before the Parliament met, it was (as I remember
in <hi>September)</hi> that the Bargain and Sale was perfected, and <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk</hi>
put into the Power of the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But neither the Sale of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> without, nor the keeping up a
ſtanding Army within (called the King's Guards) after it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded
and paid off by the Covention, nor the King's Manner of
Life, could any ways abate the Loyalty of this Parliament to the
King; and keep him they would whatever came of it: And to all
the Proviſions for Security of his Perſon and Power, they will add
that to keep him in, which the <hi>Rump</hi> in its laſt Breath did to
keep him out, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſwear to keep him out. And therefore
the Parliament, Chap. 2. made the Corporation-Oath to be taken
by all the Members of Corporations, <hi>viz. I</hi> A. B. <hi>do declare and
believe, that it is not Lawful, upon any Pretence whatſoever, to take
Arms againſt the King: And that I do abhor that Traiterous Poſition
of taking Arms by his Authority againſt his Perſon, or againſt thoſe
who are commiſſioned by him: So help me God.</hi> This I think is
one of the firſt Laws that ever was made, to ſwear to Opinions
and Belief: And ſure if Swearing would determine Controverſies
and Beliefs, all Learning, Reaſoning and Inſtruction would be at
an end; and he that ſwears moſt is the beſt Logician, and the
Godlieſt Man. We will therefore conſider the Nature of an Oath,
and thoſe who are to take this Oath.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider Man, and other Senſitive Creatures in their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
and Generation, they were all paſſive, and they were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
and generated without any Act of their own Will, or the
Counſel or Concurrence of any Creature, but of a Divine and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
Power; and by a Providence and Preſcience not leſs wiſe
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:60932:222"/>
and good, than the Power was Omnipotent, they had Food, and
other Means for their Continuance in this World provided before
they were created or generated.</p>
                  <p>But though God, without the Act of the Will of any Creature,
did make Man and other Senſitive Creatures, by an inimitable
Power, which he communicated to no Creature; and by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrutable
Wiſdom and Goodneſs did provide for them before they
were made or generated; yet did he not in vain make them Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Bodies, endued with Life, Senſe and Motion; ſo that after
they were made, they might ſeek food which God had before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for them, and preſerve themſelves from other Creatures
which might be hurtful to them.</p>
                  <p>As Senſation is naturally common to Man, and other Senſitive
Creatures, ſo are the Paſſions of Love, Fear, Hatred and Deſire;
<hi>viz.</hi> Love of thoſe things which conduce to their Welfare and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation;
Fear of thoſe things which are hurtful to them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with an Hatred of them; and a Deſire of generating
their Like in other Bodies.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe Attributes common to other Creatures, God endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Man with an Intellectual and Reaſonable Soul, which is proper
to Man, excluſive to other Creatures; and made all things in this
our Habitable World for the Uſe of Man, and therefore created
Man for a Nobler End than can be found in this World, <hi>viz.</hi> capable
of Eternal Happineſs in a better.</p>
                  <p>But though God made all things in this World for the Uſe of
Man, yet few things are uſeful to Man, but as they are made ſo by
Humane Labour, Induſtry and Art; yet no Art or Science in Man
is innate or connatural, or comes to paſs by Inſpiration, Fate, or
Chance, but by Education, Learning and Experience: We do not
read that God ever made a Houſe, Cloth, a Ship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without
Man; whereas Nature of her own Accord has provided Food and
all things neceſſary for other Creatures, without any Act or Care
of theirs: Thus Nature clothed Sheep and Beaſts with Wool and
Hair; Fowls with Feathers, and Fiſh with Scales: And tho Fowls
make their Neſts, and Conies and Badgers Berries, yet they do
theſe by an inſite connatural Power, not learned or taught by
any Creature.</p>
                  <p>Other Creatures live free and independent upon one another,
except the young ones of ſome Creatures, while they can ſeek
their Food and Preſervation; and are either Solivagous and Hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as Foxes, Wolves and Tigers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or live promiſcuouſly in
Herds and Flocks, and are innocent Creatures, as Sheep, Goats,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas Men live in Dependency one upon another, ſo as no
Man can ſubſiſt of himſelf; but depends upon another for things
which conduce to their Welfare and Preſervation; and are neither
Solivagous, nor live promiſcuouſly in Flocks and Herds, but in
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:60932:222"/>
Society and Converſation; and keep Company by Election or
Choice, as they ſtand in need of other Men, either for their
Neceſſity, Convenience or Pleaſure: and Men are diſtinguiſhed
from other Men by their Manners and Converſation, ſo as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
Scandalous to keep Company with Debauched and Vicious
Men.</p>
                  <p>As other Creatures live free and independent upon one another,
ſo have they all things which Nature had provided for them in
common; whereas Man lives upon thoſe things wherein he has
Property excluſive to other Men: So that it is wicked and unjuſt
for any Man who has no Property in a thing, without the Conſent
of him who has Property in it, to take it from him.</p>
                  <p>In this State of Society, out of which no Man lives, God did
not endue Man with Underſtanding and Reaſon in vain: for
whereas other Creatures purſue their Actions, being excited by the
Paſſions of Love, Fear, Hatred and Deſire; yet Man depreſſes
theſe, and governs his Actions by Underſtanding and Reaſon, ſo
that Humane Society may be preſerved.</p>
                  <p>Speech and Letters are neceſſary in Humane Society and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;
which wiſe Nature (which never acts in vain) hath
denied other Senſitive Creatures, which govern their Actions by
Senſe, and their Paſſions, theſe having no need of them. Speech
is the Mean or Inſtrument by which Men converſe to the Hearing of
one another; and Letters to the Sight: Other Creatures hear the
Sound of Speech, and can ſee Letters, but do not underſtand the
Power of the Words, or Conſtruction of them.</p>
                  <p>Man is born the moſt impotent of all other Creatures; being
naked and unarmed, yet can neither clothe nor defend himſelf
without the Help of another; he has nothing to feed himſelf with
but what he has from another; yet if he takes any thing from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
without the Conſent of that other, it will be Wickedneſs
and Theft: He is obliged to live uprightly and juſtly with other
Men; yet underſtands not how to live uprightly and juſtly, but as
he is inſtructed by Education, Learning and Experience; he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to ſpeak and write in Truth, but neither Speech nor Letters
are Inſite or Connatural, but acquired by Inſtruction and Learning
from others.</p>
                  <p>All Humane Learning, Reaſoning and Inſtruction in Religion,
Morality, and in every Art and Science, is begotten from the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
which God had before implanted in the Learner, and from the
Principles which were before underſtood by him: ſo that if a Man
be born blind, it will be in vain to inſtruct him how to be a Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
or if Dumb, to be a Muſician or Orator; or if he be not <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos
Mentis,</hi> ſo as to underſtand the Principles from which he is to
be inſtructed, Inſtruction will be as vain to him, as to teach a
Dumb Man to be an Orator, or a blind Man a Painter: So that it
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:60932:223"/>
is from thoſe Powers which God has implanted in Man, without
the Will of Man, that Man becomes capable of being inſtructed
by Man; and therefore Man is obliged to give God all Honour
and Praiſe before any other, that he endued him, without the
Help of any other, with an Intellectual and Reaſonable Soul,
capable of Inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The End of all Learning, Reaſoning and Inſtruction, is how
from Premiſes or Principles, which a Man before underſtood as
an Intellectual Creature, to govern his Intentions, Speech and
Actions from them in time to come rationally: So that as the
Underſtanding is of the Cauſes of things and Actions which were
before; ſo Reaſon is of the Conſequences of Speech and Actions
in time to come. The Underſtanding is from the Act and Power
of God, but Reaſon is from the Act or Power in Man. So that
though a Man may inſtruct another, who hath a competent Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
how to act Rationally in Conſequence, yet no Man can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
another who is a Fool or Madman, how to underſtand Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
from which he is to be inſtructed, ſo as to judg and act rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally.</p>
                  <p>As every Learner is preſumed to underſtand the Principles from
which he is to be inſtructed, ſo the Principles are aſſumed, not
proved, and are to be without Queſtion or Diſpute: For if the
Queſtion of any rational Propoſition be but probable or uncertain,
the Concluſion or Conſequence, will be leſs probable and more
uncertain.</p>
                  <p>For the better underſtanding an Oath, it will be very requiſite
to diſtinguiſh between Underſtanding and Knowledg; for Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
Intelligible Beings, as God, the Soul, a Law, Religion,
Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which can never be the Objects of Senſe, but may be
ſaid to know what he underſtands, ſenſibly, <hi>viz.</hi> of things and
Actions which are perceived by Senſe; as a Man, a Horſe, a Tree,
may be perceived by other Senſitive Creatures: But that theſe do
exiſt, is intelligible. So it is that Man is an Intellectual and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Creature; and that God has made all ſenſible things in the
World for the Uſe of Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and theſe can never be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Senſe.</p>
                  <p>As Man excels all other Creatures as he is an intellectual and
reaſonable Creature, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hereby he honours God, is helpful to other
Men, and preſerves Peace in Society; ſo on the contrary, Man
above all other Creatures abounds in Pride, Ambition, Arrogance,
Malice, Revenge, Covetouſneſs, and unlawful Luſt, whereby God
becomes diſhonoured, and the Peace of Humane Society diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
ſo as it is neceſſary in all Kingdoms and Countries, that theſe
be reſtrained and puniſhed by Civil and Coercive Laws.</p>
                  <p>Laws are twofold, Divine and Humane; Divine Laws are two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
<hi>viz.</hi> Natural, and Supernatural revealed in the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:60932:223"/>
Natural, which are preſumed to be alike engraven on the
Mind of Man: Supernatural are thoſe which Man obeys by God's
ſpecial Favour and Grace. Natural Laws are Affirmative and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative;
Affirmative, That Man honour God above all Creatures,
and that he converſe truly and uprightly with Man: Negative,
That he do not blaſpheme or diſhonour God, nor wrong, or deal
falſly or deceitfully with another, neither in his Intentions, Speech
nor Actions: ſo that Civil Laws do not forbid Blaſphemy, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral
Speech and Actions, but indifferently in divers Countries and
Places puniſh them.</p>
                  <p>I ſay the Law of Nature is alike inplanted in all Intelligible
Creatures; for where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion
nor Omiſſion: And therefore if all Men did not underſtand
that Blaſphemy, and Immoral Speech and Actions were wicked, it
would be Tyranny to puniſh them: So as Humane Judgment and
Juſtice are neceſſary for Preſervation of Humane Society; and the
End of Humane Judgment and Juſtice, is, as well to reſtore them
to Right who ſuffer Wrongfully, as to puniſh Wrong-doers.</p>
                  <p>It's fit here to diſtinguiſh between Knowledg and Belief;
Knowledg is immediate of thoſe things and Actions which fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Senſe of Man, and therefore not learned or taught, but
alike underſtood by all Men: And Verity and true Speech is what
a Man knows; whereas Belief is a Reliance upon what another
ſays to be true.</p>
                  <p>In all Legal Judgment upon which Juſtice is executed, Judges
in Civil Affairs aſſume two Premiſes, which are to be without
Queſtion or Diſpute, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome foreknown Law, and ſome Speech
or Act done; ſo that if the Law and Fact be but probable or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
the Judgment will be leſs probable and more uncertain:
But in giving Judgment, Judges do not ſwear to their Opinions,
but make ſome Laws to be their Reaſons of them.</p>
                  <p>A Promiſe is twofold, Affirmative and Negative, and is of time
to come, and is a Reſpecter of Perſons. An Affirmative Promiſe,
is a Speech or Writing, wherein one or more aſſure another or
more, upon their Truth or Faith to do ſuch an Act, in his or their
Power, in ſome certain Time and Place; or to be ſerviceable to
another or more, for ſome time, or during Life, as they ſhall be
able: a Negative Promiſe is when one or more, upon their Truth
or Faith, aſſure another, not to do ſuch an Act; and if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
mutually promiſe, this is a Contract.</p>
                  <p>A Promiſſory Oath, is when one or more affix God's Name
(which implies an Imprecation of God's Judgment upon them)
that they will do or not do, what they promiſe: But ſure Men
who give Promiſſory Oaths, ought to be well aſſured they can do
what they promiſe; and ought (conſidering the Frailty of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, and the infinite intervening Accidents which they
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:60932:224"/>
annot foreſee, or if they could, could not prevent) to implore
God's Aſſiſtance to enable them to perform their Promiſe. And
I do ſay, and verily believe, that of all Men, thoſe who ſooneſt
make Promiſſory Oaths, do moſt break them; and that Men who
are ſo forward to make theſe Promiſſory Oaths by them, cover
their Deſigns of deceiving the other, more than of performing
their Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>An Oath is ſo ſacred, that as God will not have Divine Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Worſhip, to be given to any other but himſelf, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will he have an Oath to be taken by any other Name; not
by the Sun, Moon, Earth, or all the Hoſt of Heaven. And if
he will not hold him Guiltleſs who takes his Name in vain, how
will he hold him Guiltleſs who ſwears in vain? Thereby not only
leſſening the Veneration due to his Name, but deſigning by it to
deceive another.</p>
                  <p>In all my Obſervations, I never knew any Man, who made no
Conſcience of Swearing, or taking God's Name in vain, but made
leſs in taking care to perform his Promiſes: And when I hear a
Man begin with Swearing, (not duly called unto it) I ſuſpect he
has either ſome Deſign in it, or that thereby he would create a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to that which is not true.</p>
                  <p>But how Legally or Illegally ſoever theſe Promiſſory Oaths are
impoſed, I never heard of any who was proſecuted for Perjury
upon them, except Mr. <hi>Long,</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Wilts,</hi> proſecuted in
the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> for that he had ſworn (as all Sheriffs do) not
to go out of the County without leave from the King; yet being
choſen a Parliament-Man, 3 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. came to ſerve in Parliament,
for which he pleaded the King's Writ, which was Leave from the
King; and the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> about the Interpretation of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible
<hi>Scotiſh Teſt.</hi> And I dare ſay, That if the <hi>Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance</hi>
to the King were but once taken, it would be held in
greater Veneration than by often taking it upon theſe Premiſes.
Let's ſee whether the Corporation-Oath be an Aſſertory, or Promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory
Oath, or neither: And in regard it is in two Parts, conſider
both. The firſt is,</p>
                  <p>I <hi>A. B.</hi> do declare and believe, That it is not lawful upon any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
whatſoever, to take up Arms againſt the King.</p>
                  <p>This Part of the Oath is not Promiſſory, and ſo an Aſſertory
Negative Oath: Here I will not diſpute whether there can be a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Aſſertory Oath; yet I do ſay ſuch an Oath can never extend
farther than to him who ſwears he does not know what he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to ſwear: But he can never ſwear that another does not
know it. <hi>So tho a Man may believe it's not Lawful for a Man to
take Arms againſt the King upon any Pretence whatſoever,</hi> yet he can
never extend it further than himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="437" facs="tcp:60932:224"/>
But I ſay this ſort of Swearing deſtroys the Religion and End of
an Aſſertory Oath, which is only to what a Man knows certainly
to be true; but no Man certainly knows that an Opinion or Belief
is certainly true: But tho by ſome apparent Reaſon, or the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of another, I may be of an Opinion, or Belief, yet upon
clearer Reaſon and better Authority, I may alter my Opinion and
Belief, which a previous Aſſertory Oath can never oblige me to.
In Juſtice therefore an Aſſertory Oath, That I Believe, or am of
Opinion, is not admitted, unleſs he that teſtifies ſwears the Ground
or Cauſe of his Belief or Opinion to be certain and true of his own
Knowledg.</p>
                  <p>I deſire to know what were the Grounds or Reaſons of this
Corporation-Oath, which every one ought to ſwear to be true of
his own certain Knowledg, before he <hi>believe it not to be lawful
upon any Pretence whatſoever to take up Arms againſt the King.</hi> Or,
admit there might be Reaſon for this Belief, yet if the Cauſes of
this Belief were not before known to the Taker of this Oath, ſo
as the Taker knows them to be true of his certain Knowledg, this
Oath, if any, is Perjury.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The other Part of this Oath is,</hi> And I do abhor that Traiterous
Poſition of taking Arms by his <hi>(the King's)</hi> Authority againſt his
Perſon, or againſt thoſe who are commiſſionated by him. So help me
God.</p>
                  <p>So that from ſwearing Negatively to Belief in the firſt part of
this Oath, we come to ſwear Affirmatively in this part of it: But
this part not being Promiſſory of Time to come, is an Aſſertory
Oath too, if any, beſides the taking God's Name in vain, or worſe.</p>
                  <p>An Aſſertory Oath is of what a Man knows to be certainly true,
and what was immediately the Object of Senſe. Here a Man ſwears
not that he knows, but abhors: and what does he abhor? <hi>That
Traiterous Poſition of taking Arms by the King's Authority againſt his
Perſon, or thoſe commiſſionated by him.</hi> Is Traiterous Poſition the
Object of Senſe, and immediate, ſo as the Swearer knows what
the meaning of Traiterous Poſition is? Which I believe not one
of twenty does: Or is not ſome Inference deduced from ſome Law
or Uſage, which cannot be the Object of Senſe, and ſo not to be
ſworn to?</p>
                  <p>The End of an Aſſertory Oath, is to inform the Judg and Jury,
ſo that Juſtice may be determined by it: but here is neither Judg
nor Jury to inform: What can be the end of this Swearing? Why,
'tis becauſe otherwiſe the Swearer cannot be a Member of the
Corporation; but if I cannot take his Word, I'll not take his
Oath: And he that ſwears moſt to get Places, is leaſt worthy of
them. And I dare ſay he ſo much leſs underſtands his Duty in
any Place, by how much the more he is ready to ſwear to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it: And you will ſee that thoſe Men who are ſo ready to ſwear
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:60932:225"/>
by this Oath which they did not underſtand, to get to be Members
of Corporations, ſhall be more ready to forſwear themſelves in
giving up their Charters, which they had ſworn to maintain and
keep, and which they underſtood they ought to do.</p>
                  <p>Religion, Piety, Judgment, Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, are the
ways by which God is honoured, and Peace and Happineſs eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
in Nations and Kingdoms: And will God inſtead of theſe,
ſuffer his Sacred Name to be proſtituted by vain Swearing, ſo as
to paſs unpuniſhed? Did not the Prophet <hi>Hoſea, Ch. 4. v.</hi> 3. of
old complain, That the Land mourned becauſe of Oaths? And
hath not our Land mourned ever ſince the Convocation, after the
Diſſolution of the Short Parliament 1640, did enjoin the Oath,
<hi>I</hi> A. B. <hi>ſwear that I approve the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church
of</hi> England, <hi>as containing all things neceſſary to Salvation, and will
not conſent to alter the Government in the Church, by Arch-biſhops,
Biſhops, Deans and Arch-Deacons,</hi> &amp;c. to be taken by all the Clergy?
Was God well pleaſed that his Sacred Name ſhould be affixed to
ſuch Stuff? Or did this eſtabliſh this Hierarchy? Did not the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
about a Year after expel the Biſhops out of the Lords
Houſe, and impriſoned their Perſons, and made them and all Deans
and Arch-Deacons uncapable of Temporal Juriſdiction? And did
not <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> about two Years after join in a Covenant,
and ſwear to extirpate Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, Deans, and Arch-Deacons?
Did not the Engagement expel the Covenant, and the
Recognition to <hi>Oliver</hi> out the Engagement, till Men neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
what they had ſworn, nor cared what they ſwore to? <hi>Monk</hi>
before he came out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> cauſed the <hi>Scots</hi> to abjure the
King and his Intereſt: So in his coming to <hi>London,</hi> he did by the
Officers of the <hi>Iriſh Brigade,</hi> and the <hi>Rump</hi> died abjuring the King
and Royal Family; yet in leſs than four Months after the King was
reſtor'd.</p>
                  <p>Before the <hi>Scots</hi> would admit the King to land in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the
<hi>23d</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1650, they made him, with his Hands lifted up,
ſwear in the Preſence of Almighty God, the Searcher of all Hearts,
his Allowance and Approbation of the <hi>National Covenant,</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
League</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> and Directories of Worſhip; and not
only to give his Royal Aſſent to Acts of Parliament enjoining the
ſame in all his Dominions, but to obſerve them in his private Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:
And upon his Coronation on the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1651,
repeated the ſame Oath. Yet how little did this avail him, or the
Covenanters? for in leſs than eight Months <hi>Cromwel</hi> drove him and
his Covenanters quite out of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And I dare ſay, the King
never after made uſe of them in his private Family, nor ever after
give his Aſſent to any Act of Parliament enjoining the Covenants,
tho he were reſtored to all his Dominions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="439" facs="tcp:60932:225"/>
                     <hi>From ſwearing the Corporation-Oath, the Parliament proceeds,
That all Members of Corporations declare againſt the</hi> Solemn
League <hi>and</hi> Covenant, <hi>in theſe words,</hi> I <hi>A. B.</hi> do declare, That I
hold there lies no Obligation upon me, or any other Perſon, from the
Oath commonly called the <hi>Solemn League</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> and that the
ſame was in it ſelf an unlawful Oath, and impoſed upon the Subjects
of this Realm againſt the known Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>This Declaration is as vain, and more wild than the Corporation-Oath;
for 'tis but matter of Belief or Opinion, and ſo no Iſſue
can be taken upon it: but if there could in him who declares, yet
none can be taken upon that part which declares there lies no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
upon another; and I'll put it upon this Iſſue, that ſuch a
Declaration was never before enjoin'd by any Law.</p>
                  <p>And if the Covenant be an unlawful Oath in it ſelf, becauſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by no lawful Authority, yet I ſay that no Authority under
Heaven can make the taking God's Name in vain lawful, much leſs
to take a vain or ſuperfluous Oath.</p>
                  <p>From new invented ſwearing, and declaring to keep the King in
the Kingdom, the Church makes many new invented Prayers for
him, eſpecially that for the Parliament, wherein they tell God
that the King is their moſt Religious and Gracious King; as if he
were ſo, and God did not know it; and if he were not ſo, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
God he was ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>De Jove quid ſentis?</hi> Will God be mock'd? Is not he Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient,
and knows the Secrets of every Man's Heart? Has he any
need to be informed what Man is? Or did this King's manner of
Life induce the Church to inform God that he was moſt Gracious,
or full of Grace? Or his devout Behaviour at his ſeldom Preſence
in Divine Service, declare him to be moſt Religious? This King's
Father and Grand-father's Flatterers went no higher than to flatter
them, that they were bound by no Laws, and accountable to none
but God for all their Actions, and that their Subjects were bound
to obey them in all, under Penalty of Damnation: They never
went about to perſwade God they were moſt Religious and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
in ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament chimed in with the Church, and by the <hi>Act of
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> enjoin, That every one who holds an Eccleſiaſtical
Promotion, ſhall publickly declare before his Congregation his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
Aſſent and Conſent to every thing contained and preſcribed
in the Book, entituled, <hi>The Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. Put
theſe together: <hi>I.</hi> A. B. <hi>do declare my unfeigned Aſſent and Conſent,
That the King</hi> (Charles II.) <hi>is my moſt Religious and Gracious
King:</hi> If he be ſo, how came you to know it? And if you
do not know it, how came you ſo unfeignedly to aſſent and
conſent that he is ſo? But tho to get your Living you tell the
Congregation ſo, when you do not know it; I think it's dreadful
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:60932:226"/>
for you to tell God Almighty he is ſo, if you be not very well
aſſured he is ſo. But you'll ſoon ſee what Care this King took of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which took ſuch Care for him.</p>
                  <p>Was God well pleaſed with theſe things? You ſhall ſoon ſee
unjuſt Wars and diſhonourable Peace: Such Judgments of Plague,
Fire and Invaſion into our Ports, as never before were heard of:
And tho God's Judgments were in the Land, the People did not
learn Righteouſneſs, but continued a divided and factious Nation,
and a People laden with Iniquity: The Honour of the Nation not
only loſt abroad, but a joining with a neighbouring Faithleſs,
Boundleſs and Ambitious Prince, to the endangering the Subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Religion, Conſtitutions and Liberties of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Nation. Now let's ſee what is doing in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a Man reads <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s and <hi>Drummond</hi>'s Hiſtory of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
they will better judg of General <hi>Monk</hi>'s prudent Government and
Conduct in it for eight Years together: For from the Conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Bruce</hi> and <hi>Baliol,</hi> for the Succeſſion to the Crown of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
about the Year 1280, till <hi>James</hi> VI. came to the Crown of
<hi>England,</hi> I ſcarce find five Years Peace together in any of the
Reigns between: And if for ſome time the <hi>Scots</hi> were freed from
open War, yet ſcarce at any time were they freed from Feuds
among the Nobility, or the Nobility at Diſcord and Variance with
their Kings.</p>
                  <p>After the Reformation of Religion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which began in
the firſt Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by her aſſiſting the Nobility
with an Army by Land, and a Fleet by Sea, whereby the <hi>French</hi>
ſent by <hi>Henry</hi> the Second of <hi>France,</hi> (Father of <hi>Francis</hi> the Dauphin,
who had married <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Queen) to ſubdue <hi>Scotland</hi> to
a Conformity to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, were outed; the Kirk of
<hi>Scotland</hi> ſet up a Juriſdiction as independent from the Civil as the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> was, and held it up during the Reign of <hi>Mary;</hi> and after
they had expelled her, and choſen her Son <hi>James</hi> King (about
fourteen Months old) in the Regency of <hi>Murrey,</hi> they got their
Church-Diſcipline eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament: This was in
the Year 1567.</p>
                  <p>The Kirk being poſſeſt of this Power during the Minority of
King <hi>James,</hi> and ſeveral of the Nobility having got a great ſhare
of the Crown-Lands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the King upon his Majority was
ſo poor, that he was not in a Condition to keep up the State of a
King, much leſs to curb the Inſolence of the Kirk, the Nobility
who had got the Crown-Lands joining with them.</p>
                  <p>Tho Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did not love the Kirk-Party, yet was ſhe
content to have <hi>Scotland</hi> in this State; for thereby ſhe preſerv'd
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Borders free from the Depredations which the <hi>Scots</hi>
uſually made upon them, and therefore ſecretly countenanced
both the King and Nobility, who had got the Crown-Lands; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:60932:226"/>
ever ſhe allowed the King a Penſion yearly, whereby ſhe kept the
King, as well as Kirk and Nobility, depending upon her.</p>
                  <p>In this State <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> ſtood till the Death of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth;</hi> but it was ill timed of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. to grant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
to enquire into the Crown-Lands uſurped in his Father's
Minority, and ſoon after to endeavour to ſet up <hi>Laud</hi>'s Injunctions,
and High-Commiſſion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which made the Nobility as well
as Kirk ſo fierce in oppoſing them.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Charles,</hi> offended at the Proceedings of the Parliament of
<hi>England</hi> in 1641, goes into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and eſtabliſhes the Kirk in all
their Pretenſions, and diſclaims all Title to the Crown-Lands uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in his Father's Minority, which no ways mollified either: But
next Year the <hi>Scots</hi> ſent an Army under <hi>Leſley</hi> (made an Earl by
the King) againſt him in Aid of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament: But tho
the Kirk and Nobility were thus inſolent againſt their Kings, they
patiently ſubmitted to <hi>Monk</hi> during his Government in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
except ſome few Diſturbances made by General <hi>Middleton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For neither <hi>Cromwel</hi> nor the <hi>Rump</hi> before him, truſted to the
<hi>Scotiſh</hi> Oaths, or <hi>Solemn League</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> but after they had
ſubdued them, bridled them with Forts built upon the principal
Paſſages of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and diſarm'd all the Nobility and Gentry,
and thereby kept them in Peace, which King <hi>Charles</hi> by all the
Condeſcenſions he ſubmitted to, could not procure. And hereto,
that the common ſort of <hi>Scots</hi> lived in more Freedom under <hi>Monk,</hi>
than under their Lords and Lairds; ſo that neither the Kirk or
Nobility could form the Body of an Army againſt the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before the King was reſtor'd, the Army which would have kept
him out was diſſipated the Year before by <hi>Monk,</hi> and after his
Reſtoration was disbanded, and ſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation was reſtored
to its former Government: But it was not ſo in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for not
only the Forts which bridled them, but the Army which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
them, was ſtill kept up. Nor had the <hi>Scots</hi> any hopes of
being freed from theſe Fetters, but by an intire Submiſſion to the
King.</p>
                  <p>Upon the King's Reſtoration, many Debates were in the Council
in <hi>England,</hi> about the calling a Parliament in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the
demoliſhing the Forts for keeping the <hi>Scots</hi> in Subjection; but
neither were ſo eaſily determined, for in all <hi>Scotland</hi> after <hi>Montroſs</hi>
was butcher'd, I do not find there was one of the Nobility, except
his Son, which were not <hi>Popiſh</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian;</hi> and the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Party</hi> had been ſo rigid againſt the King when he was in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and intolerable to his Father, that above a Year paſt before
any Reſolution was taken in either.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> as before ſaid, was taken Priſoner after the Fight at
<hi>Worceſter,</hi> and from that time kept Priſoner in <hi>Windſor-Caſtle,</hi> from
whence he was ſet free upon the King's Reſtoration, but became
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:60932:227"/>
ſo poor, that it's ſaid he could not meet the King, for want <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Money to pay for a Pair of Boots.</p>
                  <p>This Impriſonment was doubly happy to him: for during the
Reſtraint of his Body, he enlarged the Faculties of his Mind; and
being a Man of Parts, improved them by Contemplation and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
wherein he met with more Helps than it may be he could
have found in <hi>Scotland;</hi> whereby he became of greater Abilitie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to ſerve the King, than could be found in any other of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen;
and being in <hi>England,</hi> found better Opportunities to have
them known to the King, than any of his abſent Country-men
could.</p>
                  <p>In the late Wars between the King and Parliament, he, with
Sir <hi>John Cheeſley,</hi> were ordered Commiſſioners by the Kirk-Faction
to the Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> for propagating the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
Government: But this being moſt deteſtable at Court, <hi>Lauderdale</hi>
to raiſe himſelf, ſet himſelf with all his Skill to oppoſe it; and
by it, at firſt, got to be made Principal Secretary of State of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
and as Runnagadoes from Chriſtianity, become the greateſt
Perſecutors of Chriſtians, ſo was <hi>Lauderdale</hi> of the Kirk and <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi>
Government. However, <hi>Lauderdale</hi> ſeemed zealous for
calling a Parliament in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and demoliſhing the Forts tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

bridled the <hi>Scots,</hi> which <hi>Monk</hi> oppoſed: and hereby <hi>Lauderdale</hi>
became popular in <hi>Scotland;</hi> ſo that all Applications to the King
from thence was by <hi>Lauderdale.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this ſtate it was not eaſily determined who ſhould be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in caſe a Parliament ſhould be called; for
Affairs were not yet ripe enough to make a Popiſh one, nor would
the Court truſt a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> one: and <hi>Lauderdale</hi> would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
his Poſt at Court, where he govern'd all, but continue it
that all the Motions in Parliament might receive their Life from
him. At laſt it was agreed, That <hi>Middleton</hi> (who firſt ſerved the
Kirk againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and after changing Sides, made ſome
Buſtle in <hi>Scotland,</hi> after the King left it) ſhould be created an
Earl, and made Commiſſioner, and a Parliament ſhould be called
in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Scotland,</hi> clearly ſaw there was
no other way to redeem <hi>Scotland</hi> from being a conquered Nation,
and a Province to <hi>England,</hi> but by an entire Submiſſion to the
King. <hi>Lauderdale</hi> knew this as well as they, and therefore reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to make them pay dear for their Deliverance; and now you
ſhall ſee the Nobility and Gentry, which with the Kirk united
againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> I. divide under his Son, and ſacrifice the Kirk
and all their Diſcipline, to make an Atonement for themſelves.
The firſt Act which was ſhewed herein, was upon this Occaſion.</p>
                  <p>The firy Zeal of the Kirk-men burnt up all Rules of Prudence,
or the Conſideration of the preſent State of <hi>Scotland;</hi> ſo that even
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:60932:227"/>
in this ſtate, Crowns and Scepters muſt ſubmit to the Kirk. And
that the King might know his Duty, a Company of them met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and drew up a Supplication (as they ſaid) but in nature
of a Remonſtrance to the King, ſetting forth the Calamities they
groaned under in the Time of the Uſurpers, by their impious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments
upon the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Liberties
thereof; which of themſelves they were not able to ſuppreſs and
overcome: and the Danger of the Popiſh and Prelatical Party now
beginning again to lift up their Head, they preſs him to mind his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aths and Covenant with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Committee of Eſtates</hi> well knowing how ungrateful this
would be to the King, upon the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>August</hi> 1660. ſent a Party
and apprehended theſe Men, whereof one Mr. <hi>James Guthry</hi> was
the chief, (of whom you'll hear more hereafter) and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them Priſoners to <hi>Edinburgh-Caſtle,</hi> and from thence <hi>Guthry</hi> was
ſent Priſoner to <hi>Dundee,</hi> for treaſonable and ſeditious reflecting on
his Majeſty, and on the Government of <hi>England,</hi> and the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Committee of State,</hi> and tending to raiſe new Tumults,
and kindling a new Civil War among his Majeſty's good Subjects.</p>
                  <p>This was the firſt Spark, which ſoon burnt into ſuch a Flame,
as totally conſumed the whole Kirk-Party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and left
them in a much worſe plight than before, when they ſuffered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Uſurpation (as they called it) of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For during the late Uſurpations, the Kirk enjoyed a Liberty of
Conſcience: but it's the Nature of ſome Men, that unleſs they
may perſecute other Men, they'll exclaim they are perſecuted
themſelves; and therefore (ſince they were not able to do it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
they minded the King of his Covenant with God, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
Hereſy, Schiſm, and Profaneneſs, and to remove the
ſtumbling which the King had given them, in admitting Prelacy,
Ceremonies, and Service-Book in the King's Chappel, and other
Places of his Dominions.</p>
                  <p>But theſe Men were miſtaken in their Meaſures; for after the
King was expelled from <hi>Scotland</hi> by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> he little (I may ſay
never) obſerved the Directory of Worſhip, Confeſſion of Faith,
and Catechiſms in his Family, according to the <hi>National</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
League and Covenant,</hi> as he repeated in his Coronation-Oath,
and leſs the eſtabliſhing <hi>Presbyterian Government</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and leaſt of all in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For one of the firſt Acts of the firſt Seſſions, was an Anniverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Thankſgiving, to be obſerved on every <hi>May</hi> 29, with this Proem.</p>
                  <p>The States of the Parliament of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> taking
into their Conſideration, the ſad Condition, Slavery and Bondage, this
antient Kingdom has groaned under theſe twenty three Years <hi>(the
time when the Troubles aroſe in K.</hi> Charles <hi>the Firſt's Reign)</hi> in
which, under very ſpecious Pretences of Reformation, a publick Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:60932:228"/>
has been, by the Treachery of ſome, and Miſperſwaſion of others,
violently carried on against ſacred Authority, to the Ruin and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
ſo far as was poſſible, of Religion, this King's Majeſty, and his
Royal Government, the Laws, Liberties, and Property of the People,
and all the publick and private Intereſts of the Kingdom; ſo that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
it ſelf hath been proſtituted for the Warrant of all theſe treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Invaſions made upon the Royal Authority, and diſloyal Limitations
upon the Allegiance of the Subjects: Therefore upon the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>May</hi>
be ſet apart for an Holy Day, <hi>&amp;c. Yet ſoon after the King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration,
he wrote to the</hi> Presbytery <hi>of</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>promiſing to
countenance the Church as by Law eſtabliſhed: But</hi> Lauderdale
<hi>knew his Mind better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here it's obſervable, That in 1638, when the Kirk were ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
with lifted-up Hands in the Preſence of the Eternal God, to
ſwear to eſtabliſh their <hi>National Covenant,</hi> there was not one of
the Nobility (but the <hi>Popiſh)</hi> except the Marqueſs of <hi>Hamilton,</hi>
and the Earl of <hi>Traquair,</hi> but joined with the Kirk, expreſly againſt
the King's Command: <hi>Traquair,</hi> the Kirk-Party proceeded againſt
as an Incendiary; and after, <hi>Hamilton</hi> ſecretly joined with the
Covenanters, for which King <hi>Charles</hi> I. made him Priſoner in
<hi>Pendennis-Caſtle;</hi> from whence he was diſcharged when <hi>Fairfax</hi>
had it ſurrender'd: And not one of the Nobility (except <hi>Argile</hi>
and <hi>Caſſels)</hi> but declare this, and all the Kirk-Proceedings ſince,
Treaſonable Rebellion againſt the Laws, Liberties, and Property
of the People, and Proſtitution of Religion; and this Declaration
was celebrated with a double Sacrifice, the Marqueſs of <hi>Argile</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
executed as a Traitor, for holding Correſpondence with <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi>
and his Head ſet where <hi>Montroſs</hi>'s ſtood on the <hi>Monday</hi> before;
and Mr. <hi>Guthry,</hi> on <hi>Saturday</hi> after, for refuſing to own the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Judges in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, had his Head ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one of the Ports of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was a ſad Preſage to the Kirk of what followed: For as
they, without the King, would impoſe their <hi>Solemn League</hi> and
<hi>Covenant</hi> upon <hi>England;</hi> now, by the King and Parliament, an
<hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> (in the very Nature, if not the Words, of the
<hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi> in <hi>England)</hi> is impoſed upon them; wherein
they are to ſwear, <hi>That the King is the ſupreme Governour over all
Perſons, and in all Cauſes,</hi> &amp;c. and, <hi>That they will maintain, defend,
and aſſist his Majeſty's Juriſdiction aforeſaid, against all deadly Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and ſhall never decline his Majeſty's Power and Juriſdiction, as
they ſhall anſwer it to God.</hi> And all Perſons who refuſe to take this
Oath, to be uncapable of any publick Truſt, and to be look'd
upon as Perſons diſaffected to his Majeſty's Authority and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>11th</hi> Act of the firſt Seſſion ſays, That it is the inherent
Privilege of the Crown, and undoubted Prerogative of the Kings
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:60932:228"/>
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to have the ſole Power of chuſing Officers of State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and of holding and diſſolving Parliaments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and, That it is
High Treaſon in any of the Subjects, to make Leagues with Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
or among themſelves, without his Majeſty's Authority
firſt had, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore the League and Covenant, and all
Treaties thereon, are not obligatory; and that none preſume to
require, or renew the ſwearing the ſaid League and Covenant.</p>
                  <p>The next Act (I cannot ſay of Parliament, for it was purely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary)
was the total rooting out the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and upon this Occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>James Sharp,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Farwel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Leighton,</hi> (but
whether ſent for by the King, or ſent by the Kirk-Party, I do not
find) came in 1661 to <hi>London,</hi> and were ordained Deacons and
Presbyters, and after conſecrated Biſhops by the Biſhop of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
and two other Biſhops: The Acceptance of which was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation
of their <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ordination; nay, it was a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Invalidity of their former Ordination: and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the King, on the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1661, iſſued out a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
declaring his Royal Pleaſure to be for the reſtoring the
Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be by Arch-biſhops and
Biſhops, as it was exerciſed in the Year 1637; and that he had
nominated and preſented Arch-biſhops and Biſhops to their ſeveral
Biſhopricks, and to have the ſame Authority they had in the
Reign of his Grand-father. Thus you ſee the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which was ſet up by ſuch odd ſwearing, without the
King, is by his ſole Authority utterly ſubverted.</p>
                  <p>In Obedience to this Proclamation, the Privy-Council, the <hi>9th</hi>
of <hi>January</hi> following, did diſcharge all Eccleſiaſtical Meetings in
Synods, Presbyteries, and Seſſions, until they be authorized by
the Arch-biſhops and Biſhops, upon their Entry into the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their reſpective Sees; which was to be done ſpeedily.</p>
                  <p>Tho this Proclamation, and Intimation of the Privy-Council,
had prevented the Parliament, yet, to make ſure Work of both,
the Parliament, in their ſecond Seſſions, <hi>Redintegrated the Biſhops
to the Exerciſe of their Epiſcopal Function, and to all their Privileges,
Dignities, Juriſdictions, and Poſſeſſions, due, and formerly belonging
thereunto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And another Act did ordain</hi> all Miniſters to repair unto their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan
Aſſembly, and concur in all Acts of Church-Diſcipline, as they
ſhould be thereunto required by the Arch-biſhops, or Biſhops of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
under pain of being ſuſpended from their Office and Benefice till the
next Dioceſan Meeting for their first Fault: and if they amended not,
to be deprived, and the Church to be declared vacant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Year 1649, (when there was no King in</hi> Iſrael) <hi>the
Parliament, at the Inſtance of the Kirk, by the</hi> 39th <hi>Act,</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
all Patrons, and the King not excepted, from Preſentations to
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:60932:229"/>
Church-Benefices, for that the Eſtates of Parliament were ſenſible of
the great Obligations that lie upon them by the <hi>National Covenant,</hi>
and the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> and by many Deliverances
and Mercies from God, and by the late ſolemn Engagement unto Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to preſerve the Doctrine, and vindicate the Liberties of the Kirk
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and advance the Work of Reformation therein to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of their Power: And conſidering that Patronage and Preſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Kirks is an Evil and Bondage, under which the Lord's People,
and Miniſters of the Land, have long groaned; and that it hath no
Warrant in God's Word, but founded on the Common Law, and is a
Cuſtom Popiſh, and brought into the Kirk in time of Ignorance and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition;
and that the ſame is contrary to the <hi>2d</hi> Book of Diſcipline,
in which, upon ſolid and good Grounds, it is reckoned among the Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
that are to be reformed, and unto ſeveral Acts of the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly;
and that it's prejudicial to the Liberties of the People, and
planting of Kirks, and unto the free calling and entring of Miniſters
unto their Charge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This Act did not hold long, for next Year</hi> Cromwel <hi>enter'd</hi>
Scotland, <hi>and overturned all the Tables of</hi> Presbytery: <hi>nor was
this much mended after the King's Reſtoration; for in the ſecond
Seſſion of the firſt Parliament, 1662, the Parliament did ordain</hi>
All Miniſters who had enter'd to the Cure of any Pariſh, within Burgh
or Land, in, or ſince the Year of God 1649, to have no Right unto,
or up-lift the Rents of their reſpective Benefices, modified Stipends,
Marſh or Glebe, for this inſtant Year 1662, nor for the Year following,
unleſs they ſhould obtain a Preſentation from the lawful Patron, and
have Collation from the Biſhop of the Dioceſs where he liveth, before
the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> next.</p>
                  <p>Tho the High Commiſſion which <hi>Laud</hi> ſo zealouſly endeavour'd
to erect in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was put down by Act of Parliament 1641. in
<hi>England,</hi> yet the King, by the inherent Right of his Crown, and
by the Virtue of his Prerogative Royal, and ſupreme Authority in
Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, erected one in <hi>Scotland:</hi> The Commiſſioners
were partly Eccleſiaſticks, and partly Lay-men; who, or five of
them, whereof one to be a Biſhop, had a more arbitrary Power
over the Clergy, than was practiſed in <hi>England</hi> under <hi>Laud,</hi> and
more than <hi>Laud</hi> could have expected for a High Commiſſion for
<hi>Scotland</hi> in the King's Father's Reign.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the Kirk, which would be a diſtinct Table, and
independent upon the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> are by the Prerogative
of it committed to the arbitrary Mercy of the Prelates, whom, for
above 24 Years, they had been railing againſt, and by many Oaths
ſware to extirpate.</p>
                  <p>But the Tribulations of the Kirk, for the time to come, do not
end here; for the Parliament reſolve to ſtigmatize them for
their Actions paſt, and therefore upon the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1662,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:60932:229"/>
they form a Declaration to be ſubſcribed by all who ſhall have any
publick Charge, Office, and Truſt within the Kingdom, in theſe
Words.</p>
                  <p>I—do ſincerely affirm and declare, That I judg it unlawful
for Subjects, upon Pretence of Reformation, or any other Pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
to enter into Leagues and Covenants, or to take up Arms againſt
the King, or thoſe Commiſſionated by him; and that all theſe Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings,
Convocations, Petitions, Proteſtations, and erecting and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Counſel-Tables, that were uſed in the beginning, and for carrying on
the late Troubles, were unlawful and ſeditious: and particularly,
That thoſe Oaths, whereof the one is called the <hi>National Covenant,
(as it was ſworn and explained in the Year 1638, and thereafter)</hi>
and the other entitled, <hi>A Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> were, and
are in themſelves, unlawful Oaths; and were taken by, and impoſed
upon the Subjects of this Kingdom, againſt the Laws and Liberties of
the ſame; and that there lieth no Obligation upon me, or any of the
Subjects, from the ſaid Oaths, or either of them, to endeavour any
Change or Alteration of the Government, either in Church or State, as
it is now eſtabliſhed by the Laws of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the Parliament throw this upon the Son, which
his Father ſo zealouſly contended for, even to the Loſs of his
Life: and when they had done all they could, the Son little cared
for what they had done.</p>
                  <p>For the Year after, <hi>viz.</hi> 1663, the King granted a Toleration,
and Indulgence to Diſſenters from the Church. Thinking Men
thought this ſtrange, that the King ſhould the Year before paſs
the Act of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> as the beſt Means to ſecure the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Fanaticiſm,</hi> and in this grant a Toleration. It
could not be in Favour of them termed <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> who kept him
from his Crown; and laſt Year <hi>Venner</hi> with his Party, would have
expell'd him again: And this Year, Swarms of Pamphlets were
ſpread abroad, to defame his Perſon and Government: For print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome of which, <hi>Twyn</hi> the Printer was hanged.</p>
                  <p>Thinking Men conſidered too the time when this Indulgence
was granted: for as the King in the Sale of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> choſe to do
it in the Interval of the Sitting of the Parliament, ſo he did grant
this Indulgence (I think) in <hi>November,</hi> when the Parliament was
prorogued to <hi>February.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But tho the Parliament would take no notice of the Sale of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi>
they did of this; and therefore the Commons upon their
Meeting, entred into a ſerious Debate about it, and made an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
to the King, humbly repreſenting, <hi>How it would reflect upon
the Wiſdom of the Parliament, to have ſuch an Alteration made ſo ſoon,
and that for ought they could foreſee, would end in Popery:</hi> And ſure
the Commons were true Prophets herein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="448" facs="tcp:60932:230"/>
However, whether the King fearing the Continuance of the
Indulgence might retard the Commons in giving him Money, or
that time was not yet ripe enough to inſiſt upon it at preſent, he
recalled his Declaration: So that tho the King did eſtabliſh a High
Commiſſion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by his Prerogative Inherent in his Crown,
which the Parliament agreed to in <hi>Scotland;</hi> yet this Indulgence
had not the like Effect in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Indulgence may ſeem more ſtrange, if we look into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
where the <hi>Iriſh</hi> this very Year were contriving a Maſſacre
of the Proteſtants, and holding Intelligence with the <hi>French</hi> King,
which you may read at large in <hi>Plunket</hi>'s Trial, and this proved by
Popiſh Witneſſes. I do not find the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had any Countenance
herein by the King; nor do I believe the <hi>French</hi> King acquainted
his Brother of <hi>England</hi> with it: Yet the Inſincerity of the King's
Intentions of any Benefit the Proteſtant Diſſenters ſhould have by
this Indulgence, will appear by this, that when the Parliament,
ſeeing the Danger which the Proſecution of Proteſtant Diſſenters
might bring upon the Nation, had prepared Bills for the Eaſe of
Proteſtant Diſſenters, the King would not paſs them.</p>
                  <p>However the Memory of the Rage and Tyranny of the late
Times took deeper Impreſſion in the Parliament, than the Fear of
<hi>Popery,</hi> intended by the King's Toleration and Indulgence, and
therefore the Parliament from new invented Swearing, and new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
Declaring, proceed to new invented Laws againſt Diſſenters
and Conventicles; and the Act of the 16 <hi>Car. 2. c.</hi> 4. does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the 35 of <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. to ſtand in full Force, and ought to be
put in Execution: and did alſo enact, That if any Number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Five more than the Family ſhall meet in any Aſſembly or
Conventicle, upon Colour or Pretence of Religion, in any other
manner than is allowed by the Liturgy and Practice of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> he ſhall be committed Priſoner for the firſt Offence,
there to remain for a Term not exceeding three Months, unleſs
ſuch Offender ſhall pay a Sum of Money, not exceeding Five
Pounds; for the ſecond Offence, to be committed to Priſon for a
Term, not exceeding Six Months, or pay a Sum not exceeding
Ten Pounds; and for the third Offence to be tranſported beyond
the Seas for the Space of ſeven Years, unleſs he pay one hundred
Pounds.</p>
                  <p>I will not diſpute the Juſtice of theſe Laws; but I ſay, no
Human Laws can diveſt Men of Human Nature, but that Man as
well as all other Creatures, will endeavour by ſuch Means as they are
endued with, to preſerve their Being and Subſiſtence in this World.
And herein I again obſerve the unhappy State of this Nation in
the Education of Youth in the <hi>Grammar-Schools,</hi> and our <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Learning,</hi> (as 'tis called:) For tho a great Part of the Youth
of <hi>England</hi> have Means to maintain them, after they have loſt
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:60932:230"/>
their time of Youth, under this unprofitable Breeding, whereby
they are no way inſtructed how to live and converſe in this World;
yet double, if not treble Numbers of Youth, are thus bred, who
have little or no Means to maintain them after they become Men,
and more than can be maintained by the Revenues of the Church,
as they are eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>I ſay therefore, this kind of Breeding Youth, ſhall eternally
create Feuds, and a kind of Civil War, between thoſe who are
in Church-Preferments, and thoſe excluded from them; and theſe
for their neceſſary Subſiſtence, ſhall become Patrons of Factions
oppoſite to the Church, within the Kingdom, and to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Popiſh Intereſt without. In the late Times, when the
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> bare the Sway<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were there not enow of that Party to
ſupply the Vacancies of the Sequeſtred Clergy; beſides ſuch Swarms
of the Patrons of Independency, as were more numerous than
they, and who turned them out: Yet was there a large Relick
for to promote the Popiſh Faction. Upon the Reſtoration of the
King, when the Sequeſtred Clergy were reſtored, were there not
Multitudes of ſuch Clergy as would have conformed, yet could
not get any Preferment in the Church? Thus excluded, what other
means had they to ſubſiſt, but to become Nurſeries of Factions,
which were oppoſite to the Church? and tho theſe Laws were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
againſt Proteſtant Diſſenters, who had no other means of
living but diſſenting, yet you ſhall ſoon hear of another Sort of
Diſſenters; and theſe ſecretly countenanced by this moſt Religious
and Gracious King, which ſhall be much more dangerous to this
Church and State, than thoſe againſt whom theſe Laws were made.
And I ſay, <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonableneſs of Separation from the Communion of
the Church of</hi> England will no more prevent this, than <hi>Origines
Sacrae,</hi> by not only confounding, but inverting all Rules and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Reaſoning, prove a Deity, or the Authority of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scriptures, thereby making them the Creatures of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the Production of a Fantaſtick Brain.</p>

by Sea or Land, if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould oppoſe it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the outward Appearance ſeemed otherwiſe on the <hi>French</hi>
Part: for in the Favour of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> he made War upon the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> tho to no Benefit of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> other than by the influence
of his Party upon the <hi>Engliſh Counſels.</hi> But to return his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy,
the <hi>Dutch</hi> during this War built him ſix great Men of War;
and the <hi>Dane</hi> joining with the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
built the <hi>French</hi> as many more; ſo that whilſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
were fighting with one another to deſtroy their Men of War,
the <hi>French</hi> King looked on, and without fighting encreaſed his.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> had been above Eighty Years Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
in the <hi>Eaſt-India, African</hi> and <hi>American</hi> Trades; ſo that if
either had a mind to quarrel, it would not be hard to find an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
for it. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> kept ſo ſevere a Hand over the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> that they durſt not preſume to give the <hi>Engliſh</hi> any Cauſe
of Offence during her Reign; nor do I find the <hi>Engliſh</hi> gave them
any in King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign: Yet the <hi>Dutch</hi> gave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> a
moſt abominable one, in the Buſineſs of <hi>Amboyna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The World taking notice of the Vaſt Power at Sea, and Wealth
which the <hi>Dutch</hi> acquired by the Fiſhery upon the Coaſts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Scotland;</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> I. required a Tribute or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
from them about the Year 1630, as a Right belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
not to part with their Fiſhery, and unwilling to pay the
King any Acknowledgment for it; and inſtead of Payment, ſet
<hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> to work, with his Pen to diſcharge it: Which he did
in a little Treatiſe, called <hi>Mare Liberum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King to vindicate his Soveraignty, ſet Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> (then at
ill Terms with him, for I think he was a Priſoner in the Tower,
for not ſubmitting the Debates in Parliament to the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of the Council-Table and Court of <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Bench)</hi> to write
<hi>Mare Clauſum,</hi> in Anſwer to <hi>Grotius</hi>'s <hi>Mare Liberum:</hi> Yet this is
obſervable, how much the <hi>Dutch</hi> Intereſt governed their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
for ſoon after, (I will not ſay the certain time) in all their
Manifeſto's in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſtiled themſelves Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns
of the <hi>Southern</hi> Seas: And, as ſuch, you'll hear how they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
their Soveraignty over the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But King <hi>Charles</hi> (though he raiſed Ship-Money upon Pretence
of ſuppreſſing Pirates, and for Safety of the Nation) in <hi>May
1636,</hi> iſſued out a Proclamation, forbidding the <hi>Dutch</hi> and all Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Nations Fiſhing upon the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi>
which the <hi>Dutch</hi> little regarding, ſet out for this Fiſhery notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:
Whereupon the King commanded the Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi>
                     <pb n="451" facs="tcp:60932:231"/>
with a Fleet of ſixty Men of War, to take an Account
of their Diſobedience. The Earl with this Fleet, fell in upon
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and diſperſed them, and cut their Nets, ſo as the
<hi>Dutch</hi> were forced to ſeek for Shelter in the King's Harbours;
where they were detained till they made a Compoſition to pay the
King Thirty Thouſand Pounds ſterling yearly, for Licence to fiſh:
And this was all the Action done, by raiſing Ship-Money for the
Safety of the Nation, (whereof the King was ſole Judg) and for
Suppreſſing Pirates.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> in return, next Year, or the Year after, upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of taking in freſh Water, ſeize upon <hi>New-York</hi> in <hi>Long-Iſland</hi>
in <hi>America,</hi> and change the Name into <hi>New-Amſterdam.</hi> But
at this time things were in higheſt Ferment, both in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> about eſtabliſhing <hi>Laud</hi>'s <hi>Injunctions</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
a High Commiſſion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the King's Supreme
Eccleſiaſtical Power, which the King was ſo intent upon, that he
neglected to call the <hi>Dutch</hi> to an Account for the Surpriſal of <hi>New-York.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Year 1643, the <hi>Dutch,</hi> by Virtue of their Soveraignty
in the <hi>Southern Seas,</hi> by one <hi>Geland,</hi> in a Hoſtile Manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Goa</hi> and <hi>Maccao,</hi> in the Straits of <hi>Malacca,</hi> made Prey of
the <hi>Bona Eſperanza,</hi> and ſpoiled her of all her Tackle, Apparel, Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture,
and all the Goods and Lading in her, in her Return of a
very hopeful Voyage from <hi>China,</hi> and carried them to <hi>Batavia,</hi>
where without due Proceſs of Law, they were confiſcated: and the
ſame Year, the Ship called the <hi>Henry Bonadventura,</hi> being come on
Ground near the Iſland <hi>Mauritius,</hi> was ſeized with all her Goods
and Lading, by the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Company, and kept from the
Owners: And theſe Actions, both in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi>
were done in time of Peace between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Ships were ſet out by the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> Sir <hi>William
Courten,</hi> Sir <hi>Paul Pindar</hi> and others, by Virtue of a New Charter
granted by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, in the Year 1635, and had laid
the Foundation of a much more advantageous Trade for the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
than that of the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi> Company: For the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi>
and middle Parts of <hi>China,</hi> are cold or temperate, and ſo
our Woollen Manufactures would have been very acceptable to
them; whereas they are of little Uſe in the <hi>Southern</hi> Parts of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
and all the Iſlands in the <hi>Indian Ocean,</hi> which lie in the <hi>Torrid
Zone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> Sir <hi>Paul Pindar,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi>
being Royaliſts, took no Care for Satisfaction in the late times:
Nor do I find the <hi>Rump</hi> made any of theſe the Cauſes of the War
between the <hi>Dutch</hi> and them; nor did <hi>Oliver</hi> in the Peace he made
with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> take any Notice of theſe Violences uſed by the
<hi>Dutch</hi> againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or the Honour of the Nation; yet he would
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:60932:232"/>
not by his Peace, diſcharge the <hi>Dutch</hi> from the Buſineſs of <hi>Amboy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
but this was referred, 'twas ſaid, to the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to be determined by them; but was never after regarded.</p>
                  <p>But King <hi>Charles</hi> II. being at better Terms with his Parliament
and Subjects than his Father, the next Year after his Reſtoration,
<hi>viz.</hi> 1661, ſent Sir <hi>Robert Holmes</hi> with a Squadron of Men of
War, and ſome Soldiers to <hi>America,</hi> with which he reduced <hi>New
York,</hi> and all that which the <hi>Dutch</hi> had taken from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in
<hi>Long-Iſland:</hi> And from thence Sir <hi>Robert Holmes</hi> ſailed to <hi>Africa,</hi>
and took <hi>Cape Verd,</hi> and ſome other Places, where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had
Factories.</p>
                  <p>And about the ſame time, the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> with <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Courten,</hi> (Grandſon of Sir <hi>William)</hi> and the Executors and
Creditors of Sir <hi>Paul Pindar,</hi> repreſented their Caſe to the King;
who by Letters under the King's Signet Manual, demanded Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the States for theſe Depredations, by Sir <hi>George Downing</hi>
the King's Envoy, without any Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Thus things ſtood, when the <hi>Algerines</hi> being at War with the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> by their Ambaſſadour, deſired the
King in 1663, to join a Squadron of Ships with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the <hi>Algerines</hi> to better Terms, which the King did, and ſent a
Squadron under Sir <hi>John Lawſon</hi> to that end: And the <hi>Dutch</hi>
ſent another commanded by <hi>De Ruiter</hi> ſeemingly, but not deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
for to join Sir <hi>John</hi> againſt the <hi>Algerines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>De Ruiter</hi> after he had entred the <hi>Straits,</hi> abandoned Sir
<hi>John Lawſon,</hi> and ſailed to <hi>Cape Verd,</hi> and diſpoſſeſſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of
their Factories, nor did he ſtay there; but ſailing thence, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
<hi>Barbadoes,</hi> but was beaten off with loſs: But with better
Succeſs he ſailed to <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> where he made great Depradations.</p>
                  <p>This Double-dealing of the <hi>Dutch</hi> alarm'd the Parliament, ſo
as they petitioned the King to make War upon the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the
King was well diſpoſed to it; (having before deſigned it, as many
thought, and ſo took this Occaſion for it:) nor were the City of
<hi>London</hi> leſs forward than the Parliament for promoting this War;
and upon that Account furniſhed the King with ſeveral Sums of
Money, for which both Houſes gave the City Thanks, upon the
Twenty Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> 1665.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King the Day before, made this Speech to the</hi> Commons.
Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> and you Gentlemen of the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> I know
not whether it be worth my Pains to endeavour to remove a vile Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy
which ſome ill Men ſcatter abroad, and which I am ſure will never
ſink into the Breaſt of any Man who is worthy to ſit upon your Benches;
that when you have given me a Noble and Proportionable Supply for the
Support of a War, I may be induced by ſome evil Counſellors, <hi>(for they
will be thought to think very reſpectfully of my Perſon)</hi> to make
a ſudden Peace, and get all the Money for my own Private Occaſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="453" facs="tcp:60932:232"/>
But let me tell you, and you may be confident of it, That when I am
compelled to enter into a War for the Protection, Honour and Benefit of
my Subjects, I will (God willing) not make a Peace, but upon the
obtaining and ſecuring thoſe Ends for which the War is entred into; and
when that can be done, no good Man will be ſorry for the Determination
of it. <hi>But the War was not declared till the</hi> 22d <hi>of</hi> February <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:
But here I obſerve, that neither my Lord Chancellor</hi>
Hide, <hi>nor my Lord Treaſurer</hi> Southampton <hi>were preſent in Council
at it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may ſeem ſtrange to any Man converſant in our Government,
that the King in leſs than four Years and a half after his Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
ſhould be in ſuch a Neceſſity of borrowing ſuch Sums of
Money of the City; for the disbanding of the Army was paid by
the Convention and Parliament, and the Parliament had ſettled the
Exciſe on him, which was ceſſed at 500000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and
the Cuſtoms at 600000 <hi>l.</hi> and Chimney-Money worth 150000 <hi>l.
per Annum,</hi> and 12 <hi>Car. 2. c.</hi> 26. granted the King the Arrears of
twelve Months Aſſeſſment, commencing the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1659,
and <hi>(C. 29.)</hi> gave the King 70000 <hi>l.</hi> and <hi>(C. 34.)</hi> alſo the <hi>Poſt-Office,</hi>
worth 50000 <hi>l. per Annum;</hi> and in the 13 <hi>Car. 2. cap.</hi> 3.
veſted in the King the Arrears of the Exciſe and new Impoſts;
and in the ſecond Seſſion <hi>(Cap. 3.)</hi> the Parliament gave the King
1270000 <hi>l.</hi> and <hi>(Cap. 5.)</hi> a voluntary Contribution, and <hi>(C. 8.)</hi>
gave the poor Cavaliers 60000 <hi>l.</hi> that the King might never hear
more of them; and <hi>(C. 9.)</hi> granted a further Relief for the poor
and maimed Officers which had ſerved the King's Father; and
alſo <hi>(Cap. 15.)</hi> four intire Subſidies by the Laity and four by
the Clergy, beſides all the forfeited Eſtates both in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the Exciſe, Cuſtoms, Chimney-Money, Poſt-Office and
forfeited Eſtates, at a moderate Computation, may be computed
at 1600000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> a new Addition to the Crown which
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had not; only the <hi>Court of Wards</hi> was exchanged
for part of the Hereditary Exciſe. And, if you compute but ſix
Months Arrear of the twelve Months Aſſeſſment at 70000 <hi>l. per
Menſem,</hi> beginning at <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> 1659, this will amount to 420000 <hi>l.</hi>
and the Arrears of the Exciſe and new Impoſt at 300000 <hi>l.</hi> and
70000 <hi>l.</hi> granted the King, 12 <hi>Car.</hi> I. 29. and the 1270000 <hi>l.
13 Car.</hi> II. 3. and the voluntary Contribution at 300000 <hi>l.</hi> and the
four Subſidies granted by the Clergy and Laity at 400000 <hi>l.</hi> beſides
the new added Revenue of 1600000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to the Crown,
the King in leſs than four Years and a half received 2860000 <hi>l.</hi> or
two Millions eight hundred and ſixty thouſand Pounds.</p>
                  <p>Yet the King paid no Debts of his Father's, nor do I find he
built any new Men of War, nor made any War except that laſt
Year againſt the <hi>Algerines:</hi> It's true, he married his Siſter, but
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:60932:233"/>
had twice her Portion of the French King for the Sale of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi>
and alſo 400000 <hi>l.</hi> Portion with the Queen. Now let's ſee how
things ſtood in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During the Earl of <hi>Middleton</hi>'s Commiſſion, the Parliament of
<hi>Scotland</hi> granted the King ſo great a Revenue, that the King ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
his Pleaſure not to raiſe any more; but tho <hi>Middleton</hi> in the
general Opinion had done more in <hi>Scotland</hi> than could have been
expected, yet <hi>Lauderdale</hi> thought he had not done enough, and
therefore got the Parliament to be diſſolved, and a new one to be
called in 1663, and the Earl of <hi>Rothes</hi> (the Ring-leader of the
Presbyterians in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and was the firſt
that ſubſcribed the Letter to <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII<hi>th</hi> for his Aid, by the
Appellation of <hi>Au Roy)</hi> to be made Commiſſioner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King's Supremacy in all Eccleſiaſtial and Civil Matters, and
ſo great a Revenue as the King could ask being ſettled by</hi> Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
<hi>one would have thought no more could be done; yet another
Law muſt be paſſed, intituled the</hi> Humble Tender: Whereby the
Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> is obliged to raiſe the King twenty thouſand Foot,
and two thouſand Horſe ſufficiently armed, and furniſhed with forty
days Proviſion, to be in a readineſs at his Majeſty's Call: And alſo
that all Scots-Men from ſixteen to ſixty, if the King ſhould have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
uſe of them, ſhould hazard their Lives and Fortunes, as they ſhall
he called by his Majeſty, for the Safety and Preſervation of his Sacred
Perſon, Authority and Government, to march into any part of <hi>Scotland,
England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the ſuppreſſing any Foreign Invaſion, or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
Troubles, or any other Service wherein his Majeſty's Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
was concerned: <hi>And this Law it may be was the Equivalent for
which the Forts were demoliſhed. Tho</hi> Rothes <hi>was Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner
when the Act paſſed, yet</hi> Lauderdale <hi>aſſumed to himſelf the
Glory of it; and it's obſervable, this Act paſſed the ſame Year, and
about the ſame time the King iſſued out his Declaration of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to the Diſſenters in</hi> England.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, as the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> outrun the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England</hi> in Loyalty to the King, ſo at leaſt they went hand
in hand with them in grauting the King more Aids than he would
ask of the Subjects of his antient Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Never had Kings of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland</hi> their Debts ſo eaſily
paid, or was one tenth part ſo highly careſſed by their Subjects in
a time of Peace. Was it not ſtrange then that the King ſhould be
in ſuch Neceſſities for Money, as to borrow ſuch great Sums of
the City for carrying on this haſty War before the Parliament
ſhould meet to ſupply him?</p>
                  <p>Whereas when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to the Crown, her Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
beſides the Court of Wards, and the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi>
was but 188179 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and the Crown left in Debt by her
Father, Brother and Siſter (which ſhe afterwards paid;)
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:60932:233"/>
and for the four firſt Years of her Reign, the Parliament gave
her but one Subſidy and two Fifteens about 120000 <hi>l.</hi> Yet in
theſe Years ſhe fitted up her Navy Royal, ſo as it was not only ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
to thoſe of all the Neighbouring Nations, but of any
Prince in the World; and alſo ſent a Fleet and Land-Army into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> with which ſhe expelled the <hi>French</hi> out of it. And the
Parliament in the fifth Year of her Reign gave her but another
Subſidy, and two Fifteens, wherewith ſhe aſſiſted the Princes of
the Reform'd Religion in <hi>France:</hi> Whereas the Parliament in the
fifth Year of this King's actual Reign, gave him 2467500 <hi>l.</hi> for
carrying on the War againſt the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will not diſpute the Juſtice of this War, yet ſure never was
any made with ſuch Precipitancy and Inconſideration both abroad
and at home: for as the King entred into no Alliances or Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
abroad in it; ſo on the contrary, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi>
(our next Neighbouring Nations) join'd with the <hi>Dutch</hi> againſt
the King; and that tho the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſtood Neuter in it, yet the
King had little reaſon to expect any Benefit from him, having been
ſo uſed in the King's Sale of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> and joining
with the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> and <hi>French</hi> againſt the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as the King had made no Foreign Alliances abroad, ſo had
he not laid up any Naval Stores at home; and, which is worſe,
he had the Act of Navigation (tho made by the <hi>Rump,</hi> yet the
Parliament 13 <hi>Car.</hi> II. confirmed it, or ſet the Royal Stamp up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it) to ſtruggle with to ſupply himſelf with Naval Stores for
carrying on the War.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Rump</hi> were as haſty in making the Act of Navigation,
as the King was in entring into this War, and made it general,
without any Conſideration of Time, either in War or Peace: and
herein their Zeal to make this Law outrun their Wit or Memory;
for theſe very Men about ten Years ago, <hi>viz. 16 Car.</hi> I. 21.
(which yet ſtands unrepealed) taking notice of the manifold
Miſchiefs, tho in time of Peace, which happened by reaſon the
Importation of Gunpowder was prohibited, contrary to Law, <hi>viz.</hi>
That the Price of Gunpowder was exceſſively raiſed, many Powder-Mills
decayed, the Kingdom much weakned and endangered, the
Merchants much damnified, many Mariners and others taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
and brought into miſerable Captivity and Slavery, many
Ships taken by <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pirates, and many other Inconveniences
thereby enſued, and like to enſue: Therefore this Act made the
Importation of Gunpowder, Salt-petre, and Brimſtone free to
Strangers as well as Natives, and a <hi>Premunire</hi> to hinder it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in this War, if the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company ſhall ſet double or
treble the Price upon Salt-petre, or if their Ships ſhould miſcarry,
yet by this Act it is Confiſcation of Ship, Goods, Tackle, Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:60932:234"/>
and Ammunition, for the Subjects of any other Nation to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
Salt-petre, or Gunpowder.</p>
                  <p>The King, tho this were a Naval War, having laid up no Stores
for it; yet if the <hi>Swede</hi> from any Port of <hi>Norway</hi> but <hi>Gottenburg,</hi>
or if the <hi>Bradenburgher, Lubeker, Hamburgher,</hi> or <hi>Emdenber,</hi> ſhould
import any from any Port of <hi>Norway,</hi> or any rough Hemp or Flax
from <hi>Leifland</hi> or <hi>Pruſſia</hi> for making Cordage or Sails, this had
been Confiſcation of Ships, Goods, Guns, Tackle, Ammunition and
Apparel by this Act.</p>
                  <p>This Act reſtraining the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Trade, and to
the Plantations, to navigate their Ships by three fourths <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
the King was forced to man his Fleet with preſſed Men, the
greater part whereof were Land and Water-Men: Whereas, if it
had been free for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> during the War to have imployed
Foreigners in theſe Navigations, the King might have above twenty
thouſand of his beſt Sea-men more than he had to man his Fleet,
and the City of <hi>London,</hi> and other Parts of <hi>England</hi> throughly
ſupplied with Coals at half the Prices, and with more Security.</p>
                  <p>The King by reaſon of this Act, in the firſt Year of this War,
was forced in the dead of Winter to ſend Sir <hi>John Harman</hi> to <hi>Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenburg</hi>
with a Squadron of Men of War for Maſts, Pitch and Tar,
where by the Coldneſs of the Seaſon ſome of the Ships were
frozen up, and many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> loſt their Noſes, and were
benumm'd in other Parts with the Cold: Yet all agreed, if the
King had not been ſupplied with Naval Stores by this Fleet, he
could not have fitted out a Fleet next Year.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things, tho evident to any Stander-by, yet the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
took no notice of them: However, the King wiſely diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with the Act of Navigation, ſo far as it related to the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Naval Stores, and Hemp, and Flax, with this different
Succeſs, that tho the Parliament the Year before boggled at the
King's diſpenſing with the Penal Laws againſt Diſſenters, yet they
took no notice of the King's diſpenſing with the Act of Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Tho this War was thus haſtily begun, yet was it managed more
careleſly and prodigally than ever any was before: The Officers of
the Fleet, like thoſe of the Guards, bought their Places to ſell
their Lives; the poor common Sea-men not paid, and wanting
Money to pay their Quarters, were forced to take Tickets for leſs
than half their Wages: whilſt Favourites ſwelled into incredible
Riches by the Ruin and Spoil of the Nation. The innumerable
Prizes taken from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> were ſo far from contributing to
the Charges of this War, that many of them were given to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Favourites, and became a Charge to the King: no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
muſt be into the defraying the Monies given for the War,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:60932:234"/>
for this was to diſtruſt the King: The Officers who had bought
their Places in the Fleet, inſtead of minding their Buſineſs, made
it their Buſineſs how to be Gainers for the Purchaſe of their Places,
and caballed how they might improve their Intereſt at Court.</p>
                  <p>However, the King receiving no Satisfaction from the <hi>Dutch</hi> for
the Injuries done to Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul Pindar,</hi> upon
the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1665 granted Letters of Repriſal to Sir <hi>Edward
Turner</hi> and <hi>George Carew,</hi> their Executors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
till they ſhould be ſatisfied 151612 <hi>l.</hi> This Grant to ſtand in
force notwithſtanding any Peace to be made, till Sir <hi>Edward Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
&amp;c. were fully ſatisfied of the ſaid Sum, with all their Coſts
and Damages.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> opened the firſt Sea Campagn, by falling upon
the <hi>Dutch Smirna</hi>-Fleet, and took four of them richly laden; and
the third of <hi>June</hi> following, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet commanded by the
Duke of <hi>York,</hi> Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> Admiral of the White, and the Earl
of <hi>Sandwich</hi> of the Blue, fought the <hi>Dutch</hi> off the Coaſt of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
where the <hi>Dutch</hi> were put to flight; <hi>Opdam</hi> their Admiral
was blown up, and <hi>Cartinere, Stillingwolf</hi> and <hi>Stamp</hi> Flag-Officers,
killed, and eighteen of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet ſunk and taken; and if it
had not been for fear of diſturbing the Duke in his next Night's
Sleep, it's believed the whole <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet might have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd.
But in this Fight, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> loſt the renowned Earl of
<hi>Marlborough;</hi> who, tho Admiral in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's Reign,
died a private Captain in this Fight; Rear-Admiral <hi>Sanſon</hi> was
killed in it, and Vice-Admiral <hi>Lawſon</hi> ſoon after died of his
Wounds.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>York</hi> was of too eſtimable a Value to be ventur'd
any more in this War, for in his Perſon the Hopes of this War
and Declaration of Indulgence reſolved: So the Earl of <hi>Sandwich</hi>
was made Admiral, Sir <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> of the White, and Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Tiddiman</hi> of the Blue Squadrons.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> were ſo damaged in the firſt Fight, that they were
not in a Condition to ſet out another Fleet this Year. But the
<hi>Dutch</hi> having lodged their <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> and other Fleets in <hi>Bergen</hi> in
<hi>Norway,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet ſailed thither to attack them in it.</p>
                  <p>But Sir <hi>Thomas Tiddiman,</hi> who was ordered to do it, did not
ſail into the Harbour as he might have done upon his firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
but ſent to the Governour of the Caſtle to treat without;
the <hi>Dutch</hi> within, alarm'd at the Danger, ſet all hands on work
that Night, ſo that by the Morning they had ſo fortified the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
that it was impoſſible for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to force a Paſſage: and
the Weather growing boiſterous, it being towards the latter end
of <hi>September,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet was forc'd to return; nor could
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet ſtay in <hi>Bergen;</hi> and in their Return home, two of
their richeſt <hi>East-India</hi> Ships, and about 80 Sail of their other
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:60932:235"/>
Ships fell to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhare: but tho they were deep laden
when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> took them, they became much lighter before they
came into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Harbour.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems God was not pleaſed with theſe things; for this Year
he ſent a horrible Plague, which raged over almoſt all the Parts
of <hi>England.</hi> The greateſt Plague which happened ſince <hi>Edward</hi>
the Third's time in <hi>England,</hi> was in the firſt Year of this King's
Grandfather; yet a greater in the firſt Year of his Father's Reign;
and now a greater than either, in the ſixth Year of his actual
Reign. And as the Plague drove the Parliament to <hi>Oxford</hi> in his
Father's Reign, ſo did it now in his.</p>
                  <p>But neither the Mourning of the Land becauſe of Oaths, the
Plague, this <hi>Dutch</hi> War, nor the King's Declaration of Indulgence
for diſpenſing with the Penal Laws againſt Diſſenters, could abate
the Parliament's Zeal in proſecuting Proteſtant Nonconformiſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
but they made a Law, called the <hi>Five-Mile-Act,</hi> whereby
they were baniſhed five Miles from any Corporation, or Market
Town, and had this Oath impoſed upon them.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>A. B.</hi> do declare, That it is not lawful, upon any Pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
to take up Arms against the King; and that I do abhor that
traiterous Poſition, of taking up Arms by his Authority against his
Perſon, or any that are commiſſionated by him, in purſuance of ſuch
Commiſſion. And I do ſwear, that I will not, at any time to come,
endeavour the Alteration of the Government either in Church or State.
<hi>So help me God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The poor Non-conforming Miniſters did quietly ſubmit to this
in <hi>England,</hi> but the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> did not ſo to the High Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
erected in <hi>Scotland;</hi> for about this time they roſe in Arms at
<hi>Pentland,</hi> againſt the Perſecution of the Prelates who diſturbed
them in the Execution of their Miniſtry; but were ſoon broken,
and a terrible Execution follow'd upon them, as Traitors and
Rebels.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>England,</hi> the Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> granted the King 1250000 <hi>l.</hi>
for carrying on the War againſt the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and in the Spring 1666
the Plague ceaſing, the King ſet forth a Fleet under the Command
of Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
of the <hi>White,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Berkley</hi> of the <hi>Blue.</hi> But the
<hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> now try to do that by Craft which they could not
do by Force and Plain-dealing: And to this purpoſe it was given
out, that the <hi>French</hi> had fitted up a ſtrong Fleet to join the <hi>Dutch;</hi>
and this ſo prevailed upon the King and Council, that upon the
<hi>29th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> (a remarkable Day) when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the <hi>Downs,</hi> Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> in all haſte, was ordered with
the <hi>White</hi> Squadron to ſail to the Weſt, to fight the <hi>French</hi> Fleet
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:60932:235"/>
coming to join with the <hi>Dutch.</hi> I deſire to be particular in ſome
part of what followed, becauſe I had it from Sir <hi>John Harman</hi>
himſelf, who was Vice-Admiral of the <hi>Blue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the ſame time Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> ſailed from the Fleet, the
<hi>Dutch</hi> put out to Sea, the Wind at North-eaſt, a freſh Gale; this
brought the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet on the Coaſt of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and carried the
Prince to <hi>St. Helens,</hi> on the Iſle of <hi>Wight:</hi> but the Wind ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
turning into the South-weſt, blew a ſtrong Gale, which brought
the <hi>Dutch</hi> and Duke to an Anchor; when Captain <hi>Bacon</hi> of the
<hi>Briſtol,</hi> by firing of his Guns, gave notice to the Duke of the
Approach of the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Duke ſummoned all the Captains on board him,
not to conſult whether to fight the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but to order them to
weigh Anchor, and fight the <hi>Dutch.</hi> This was the <hi>1st</hi> of <hi>June,</hi>
the Wind at South-weſt blowing a ſtiff Gale, ſo that the <hi>Dutch</hi>
were forced to cut their Cables, not having time to weigh Anchor;
and tho the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had the Weathergage of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> yet the
Wind ſo bowed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, that they could not uſe their
loweſt Tire when they came up to fight the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>William Berkley</hi>'s Squadron led the Van: but the Duke,
when he came on the Coaſt of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> to avoid running on a Sand,
made a ſudden Tack, which brought his Top-maſt to the Board;
whereupon he was forced to lie by 4 or 5 Hours, till another was
ſet up: but the <hi>Blue</hi> Squadron knowing nothing of this, ſailed
on, fighting through the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, which were 5 to 1 of the
<hi>Blue.</hi> Here Sir <hi>William</hi> was killed, and his Ship (the <hi>Swiftſure,</hi>
a ſecond Rate, and all her Guns Braſs) taken, ſo was the <hi>Eſſex,</hi>
a Frigat of the third Rate, and Sir <hi>John Harman</hi> in the <hi>Henry</hi> got
among 9 Ships of the <hi>Zeal and Squadron,</hi> commanded by Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Everts;</hi> and theſe ſo diſabled the <hi>Henry,</hi> that <hi>Everts</hi> offered
Sir <hi>John</hi> Quarter if he would yield; but Sir <hi>John</hi> told him 'twas
not come to that yet, and gave him a Broadſide, and killed <hi>Everts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereupon this <hi>Zealand</hi> Squadron ſailed to aſſiſt their Fellows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
and only left Sir <hi>John</hi> to the Mercy of 3 Fireſhips; one of
which grappled the <hi>Henry</hi> on her Starboard Quarter: The <hi>Dutch</hi>
Fireſhips do not take Fire at firſt, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do, but firſt raiſe
a Smoak incredibly ſtinking, and ſo thick as nothing can be ſeen at
the leaſt diſtance, ſo as it could not be ſeen where the Fireſhip's
Grappling-Irons were fixed; but upon the Fireſhip's taking Fire,
Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Boatſwain ſwung himſelf into the Fireſhip, and by the
Light of the Fire found where the Grappling-Irons were fixed in
the Fireſhip, and let them looſe, and got on board again.</p>
                  <p>But another Fireſhip grappled the <hi>Henry</hi> on her Larboard Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Deck,
and took Fire, and Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Chaplain, and about 50
more, skipped into the Sea; whereupon Sir <hi>John</hi> ran among the
Mariners, and threatned to kill any other who did not aſſiſt in
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:60932:236"/>
quenching the Fire: whereupon Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Cabbin-Boy ſeeing the
Sails on fire, with wet Cloths encounter'd and put it out; but
the Cordage being burnt, the Croſs-beam fell upon Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Leg,
and broke it.</p>
                  <p>By this the third Fireſhip made towards the <hi>Henry,</hi> but 4 Pieces
of Cannon laden with Croſs-ſhot diſabled her; ſo that Sir <hi>John</hi> ſet
up Jury-Maſts, and brought the Ship into <hi>Harwich,</hi> and the next
Day after fitted her up, and tho his Leg was broke, went out to
Sea again to have fought, but the Fight was over before he could
come up to the Fleet.</p>
                  <p>In this Day's mad Fight, wherein the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could make no
uſe of their lower Tire of Guns (and therefore Sir <hi>Thomas Tiddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
Rear-Admiral of the <hi>Red,</hi> refuſed to engage) the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
were much damnified in their Rigging, yet next Day the Duke
engaged the <hi>Dutch</hi> again, tho above double his Number of Ships,
and the <hi>Dutch</hi> hourly receiving freſh Supplies; ſo he did the Day
after, the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> when the Duke cauſed ſeveral of his moſt
diſabled Ships, after he had taken out their Men, to be burnt,
and had but 16 Ships left able to fight, with which he retreated,
putting them between the <hi>Dutch</hi> and his unburnt diſabled Ships.</p>
                  <p>Towards the Evening, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> eſpied the <hi>White</hi> Squadron
making up towards them; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> engaged with the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> ſtriving to make their neareſt Way to meet the <hi>White</hi> Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron.
The <hi>Prince Royal</hi> (it may be the beſt Man of War in the
World, and beſt gunn'd) commanded by Sir <hi>George Askew,</hi> run
on a Sand, and was loſt, and Sir <hi>George</hi> made Priſoner; yet next
Day the Fleets fought again, and by the help of the <hi>White</hi> Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, with much ado, got into Harbour again;
leaving it a Problem, whether it were a greater Treachery to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the Fleet, or Madneſs to fight the <hi>Dutch</hi> with the reſt, when
they could not uſe their lower Tire of Guns.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> thus engaged at Wars at home, the <hi>French</hi>
King, inſtead of ſending his inviſible Fleet into the Channel to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> ſends a viſible Fleet to the ſubduing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in
their Plantations in the <hi>Leeward Iſlands,</hi> and almoſt totally expell'd
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>St. Chriſtophers,</hi> and interrupted them in their
Trade to their other Iſlands, and aſſumed a Soveraignty in thoſe
Seas: where, at preſent, we leave him, and return to <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Loſs and Damage which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuſtained in the laſt
Fight, gave the <hi>Dutch</hi> an Opportunity to put out to Sea, and ride
braving upon our Coaſts 3 Weeks, or a Month, before we could
repair, and fit out another Fleet: but upon the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> put to Sea again; whereupon the <hi>Dutch</hi> retreat to their
own Coaſts, where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> again engage them upon the <hi>25th,</hi>
and where they beat the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and forced them into their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
In the Fight, <hi>Everts</hi> (Brother to <hi>Everts,</hi> killed by Sir <hi>John Harman)</hi>
                     <pb n="461" facs="tcp:60932:236"/>
Admiral of the <hi>Zealand</hi> Squadron, <hi>Tirich Hides</hi> of the
<hi>Friezland</hi> Squadron, Vice-Admiral <hi>Conder,</hi> and 6 Captains, and
Vice-Admiral <hi>Banker</hi>'s Ship, and the beſt Ship of <hi>Harlem,</hi> were
taken and burnt. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> loſt but one Ship, commanded by
Captain <hi>Haiman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> thus driven in, gave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> an Opportunity to
burn the Village of <hi>Brandaris</hi> in <hi>Schelling,</hi> and fire above 150 Sail
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> within the <hi>Fly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> put to Sea again; and now
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had 10 or 12 Men of War more than the <hi>Dutch,</hi> (which
was the only time, in this and the other <hi>Dutch</hi> War, the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
had ſo many Men of War as the <hi>Dutch)</hi> and to the Amazement
of Standers-by, the <hi>Dutch</hi> forſook their own Coaſt, and ſailed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>French;</hi> for which no other Reaſon could be given,
but that the <hi>French</hi> King (who equally loved the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh)</hi>
had decoyed the <hi>Dutch</hi> to join that inviſible Fleet, which
we divided ours to fight with.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> purſued the <hi>Dutch</hi> through the Straits between
<hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Calice,</hi> and were ready to engage them, when by a
terrible Storm the Wind drove the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to an Anchor at <hi>St. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>'s
<hi>Point,</hi> where in the Paſſage the St. <hi>Andrew</hi> (a ſecond Rate
Ship) broke her Back upon a Sand, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> came to an
Anchor in the Bay of <hi>Bulloigne:</hi> and the Wind about the <hi>8th</hi> of
<hi>September</hi> turning, brought the <hi>Dutch</hi> home before the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
could engage them.</p>
                  <p>And in that inſtant, <hi>September</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> as near as could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured,
that this Storm aroſe which ſaved the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, the
City of <hi>London</hi> flew on Fire: nor did the Deſolation made by the
Fire end in it; but when it was over, by Order of Council, all the
Houſes upon the <hi>Tower</hi> Ditch, to the number of about 200, were
pull'd down, to preſerve the <hi>Tower</hi> from the Danger of another
Conflagration now the City was burnt.</p>
                  <p>The Firing of the City of <hi>London</hi> ſo ſoon ſucceeding the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Fleet, cauſed a ſtrange Conſternation, not only in
Mens Minds in <hi>London,</hi> but all the Nation over, That there were
Deſigns to ruin the Nation as well on Shore as at Sea; whereupon
infinite varieties of idle Tales and Stories were printed, as well as
ſaid; ſo as tho a general Fear of Plots againſt the Nation was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
yet in this Confuſion, the Cauſe from whence the City of
<hi>London</hi> became fired was not only ſmothered, but the Means of
ſearching into it prevented. Herein I will take notice of only two
Particulars, both which are mentioned in Sir <hi>H. C</hi>'s Speech in
the third <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Parliament, which met the <hi>21st</hi> of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
1680.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>April</hi> 1666, next before the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> ſeveral Perſons
confeſſed they had been treated with, and had treated with others
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:60932:237"/>
to burn the City of <hi>London</hi> in <hi>September</hi> following, tho the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were then ſitting, and this a Matter of State proper to be
enquired into by Parliament; yet theſe Men were hanged, ſo as no
further Enquiry could be made into it; and all thoſe who were
taken in carrying on the Work, diſcharged, except one <hi>Hubert</hi> a
<hi>Papist,</hi> who confeſſed that he and others ſet the City on Fire.</p>
                  <p>Upon this <hi>Hubert</hi> was condemned; but I do not find he was
examined who thoſe other were who joined with him in it, or
who ſet him on work: but this I find, that Mr. <hi>Hawles,</hi> in his
Remarks upon <hi>Fitzharris</hi>'s Trial, <hi>fol.</hi> 5. ſays, That the <hi>Commons</hi>
reſolving to examine <hi>Hubert</hi> upon the Matter, next Day <hi>Hubert</hi>
was hanged before the Houſe ſat, and ſo could tell no further
Tales.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who excuſed the firing of <hi>London</hi> to have been by Deſign,
or that <hi>Hubert</hi> had any hand in it, ſaid <hi>Hubert</hi> was mad, and knew
not what he did or ſaid: And why then would they let him be
tried upon it? For it is not only contrary to our Laws, but to
the Law of Nature and Humanity, to try and convict a Mad-man
of any ſuppoſed Crime, when he is incapacitated to make any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
as a Mad-man is. And tho the Statute of 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. in
High-Treaſon ordains, That if a Man fall mad after he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
High-Treaſon, yet he ſhould be tried for it and executed;
yet this extends only to High-Treaſon, upon which <hi>Hubert</hi> was
not tried; but even this Law being deemed inhumane and cruel,
was ſoon after repealed. But this Caſe of <hi>Hubert</hi>'s only led the
Van; you'll hear of others of like nature, which followed.</p>
                  <p>I remember very well, that when it was blazed about that <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
was mad, and the City in Ruin, <hi>Hubert</hi> was carried to ſhew
where he fired the City; and tho it was in its Ruin, <hi>Hubert</hi> ſhewed
thoſe who brought him, where it began. I confeſs I was not
preſent then; but ſuch was the Fame of it, which I never heard
to be contradicted.</p>
                  <p>This Year the Parliament, that they might not leſs contribute
to the <hi>French</hi> Grandeur by Sea, than the <hi>Rump</hi> had done by the
<hi>Act of Navigation,</hi> made a Law <hi>(18 Car.</hi> 2. cap. 2.) againſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattel; which, in regard it is the only Law ſince
the Creation which was ever made by any Prince or State, to make
things neceſſary for Preſervation and Convenience of Humane Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
ſcarce and dear, we will more particularly make theſe
Obſervations upon it.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon given for this Law was, That the Importation of
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattel had fallen the Rents and Value of the Lands of <hi>England,</hi>
and were like to fall more.</p>

                     <p>It's true, the Rents, and Value of the Lands of <hi>England,</hi> were fallen
at this time conſiderably, but not from the Importation of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel;
for Lands are valuable as Trade is more or leſs, and Money more
plentiful: And we have ſhewed, That the Severity uſed by the
Biſhops in 1636 had ſent many of our Woollen Manufacturers into
<hi>Holland,</hi> as much to their Enriching, as to our Impoveriſhment:
That by the Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi> in 1648, the <hi>Dutch</hi> became Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
with us in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade, whereby, above all others, we
were enriched: That by reaſon of the <hi>Act of Navigation,</hi> we have,
upon the matter, loſt the moſt beneficial Trades to <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> and
into the <hi>Sound,</hi> with our Woollen Manufactures. And beſides the
eternal fixing the Fiſhing-Trade upon the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> to the <hi>Dutch</hi> by this War, we have totally loſt the
<hi>Greenland</hi> Fiſhery, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> partake with us in the <hi>Iſeland</hi> and
<hi>Weſtmony</hi> Fiſhing Trades, and the <hi>French</hi> to the <hi>Newfound-Land:</hi>
That by <hi>Oliver</hi>'s breaking with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and joining with the
<hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> got all the Riches of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade, whilſt
we were bound to be Loſers by the <hi>French.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will add two more Reaſons of the Fall of the Lands of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
One, The advantageous Treaty of Commerce made by <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
with the <hi>French,</hi> was not eſtabliſhed by the King; but a much
worſe, if any, ſubmitted to: And after, the <hi>French</hi> ſet ſuch high
Impoſts upon our Commodities, that Sir <hi>John Trevor,</hi> in his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
takes notice that we did not vend one fourth of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
we before exported into <hi>France,</hi> whilſt we conſumed <hi>French
Wines, Brandies,</hi> and other <hi>French</hi> Wares, more than before: So
that about this time, or ſoon after, the Lords Commiſſioners for
a Treaty of Commerce with <hi>France,</hi> appointed a Committee to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
the Difference of the Ballance; which, beſides thoſe of
Gloves, Lace, Ribbon, and other Toys, did amount yearly to
965128 <hi>l. 17 s. 4 d.</hi> imported from <hi>France,</hi> more than exported
out of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other is, That the moſt gainful Trade the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have, is
that to <hi>Spain,</hi> which has no other Means to maintain it, but by
the Returns of their Fleet; which ſince we took <hi>Jamaica,</hi> the
<hi>Buccaneers</hi> ſo interrupted the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> that as
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Loſs and Returns were more difficult, ſo much was our
Trade to <hi>Spain</hi> damnified.</p>

                     <p>The Importation of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattel might fall the Rents of Lands,
yet not make them the leſs valuable; for if Landlords would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:60932:238"/>

that if they could buy their Commodities half, or one third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

one third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> more Rent, and they pay ſo much more for their
Commodities: beſides, many thouſands of People might ſubſiſt
by their Labours where Proviſions are cheaper, which could not, if
dearer; and the Charge of maintaining the Poor are ſo much
more, as Proviſions are dearer; and ſo much leſs muſt the foreign
Vent of our Manufactures be, as Proviſions are dearer whereon

                     <p>The Wools of <hi>Ireland</hi> are generally better than thoſe of <hi>England,</hi>
(I have it by very good Authority;) and by the 14 <hi>Car.</hi> II. 18.
it's Felony to export any out of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland:</hi> The Reaſon
given is, it would decay the Woollen Manufactures, ruin many
Families, and be the Deſtruction of the Navigation and Commerce
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And why would it decay the Woollen Manufactures, and ruin
many Families, to export Wool? The common Reaſon given is,
That the Natives of other Countries would work them cheaper
than the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whereby we ſhould loſe the Employment of our
People. If this be a Reaſon, this <hi>Iriſh</hi> Act was made in an ill time
to make Proviſions dearer, which will neceſſarily reſolve into a
further Dearneſs, becauſe thoſe who work our Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
muſt live by Food; and ſo much the dearer Food is, ſo
much dearer muſt Mens Labours be.</p>
                     <p>But I ſay this is not the Reaſon; for no People in the World,
in like Circumſtances, take ſo much Pains, for ſo little Profit, as
the <hi>Combers, Spinners,</hi> and <hi>Weavers</hi> do in our Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures;
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:60932:239"/>
and I'm ſure the Wools and Fullers-Earth in <hi>England</hi> are
cheaper here than can be had elſewhere; and an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man
or Woman hath a better Habit of Body, and as good a Wit, as a
<hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> Man or Woman; and that in <hi>Holland</hi> they pay as
much for Exciſe for Meat and Drink, as in <hi>England</hi> is paid for them.</p>
                     <p>I'll give the true Reaſon, why, if the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>French</hi> get our
Wools and Fullers-Earth, they may vend the Manufactures cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in foreign Trade than the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The Wools of <hi>Derbyſhire,
Nottinghamſhire, Leiceſtarſhire, Warwickſhire, Lincolnſhire, Rutland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,
Northamptonſhire, Huntingtonſhire, Hertfordſhire,</hi> &amp;c. are in the

and even the Wools of the Sheep killed in <hi>London,</hi> are
carried to <hi>Colcheſter</hi> to be wrought there; and then by another
Land-Carriage they are brought to <hi>London,</hi> as our <hi>Weſtern Cloths</hi>
are: And then none but the Free-men of <hi>London</hi> muſt buy them,
at, it may be, 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> cheaper than they might be ſold if the
Trade were free; then they muſt be vended abroad in <hi>Engliſh</hi>-built
Ships, double as dear by the <hi>Act of Navigation,</hi> and theſe
ſailed by near double the Hands of foreign Ships of like Dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and if any Returns be made, they ſhall pay twofold more
Duties than if they were imported into <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh:</hi>
And upon other Terms ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Poor muſt not be employed, working
Woollen Manufactures.</p>
                     <p>It's agreed, the vaſt Riches of <hi>France</hi> ariſe by the Trades which
the <hi>Engliſh, Dutch, Dane, Hamburgher, Embdener, Lubecker,</hi> and
<hi>Bremeners</hi> drive, trading into <hi>France</hi> for Wines, Brandies, Salt,
Paper, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> beſides theſe, for Linen, Cordage, and
Sails. Suppoſe then, the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould by Edict ordain,
that theſe ſhould be firſt brought by Land-Carriage to <hi>Paris,</hi> and
then none but the Free-men ſhould buy them at what Rates
they pleaſe, and then theſe ſhould vend them in foreign Trade
only in <hi>French</hi>-built Ships, and theſe ſailed by three fourth parts

our Practice?</p>
                     <p>At this rate we have in <hi>England</hi> more Wools than we can work;
and by this Act the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are forced to breed Sheep upon the
Grounds they bred their Cattel before the Act; and by the Act
of 14 <hi>Car.</hi> II. 18. it's Felony to export the Wools, ſo as the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> are neceſſitated to work them, where Proviſions are cheaper
than in <hi>England,</hi> and where they ſhall not be at the unneceſſary
Land-Charges of Carriage of their Wools, and Re-carriage of their

<pb n="467" facs="tcp:60932:239"/>
where their Ports are better and more convenient for foreign

Yet it had been the Intereſt of the <hi>Northern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Men to

Cattel they can make but one Return in five Years, whereas they

War againſt the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and therefore they gave the King

                     </p>
                     <p>Relying upon his Mother's Intelligence, the King, by the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

which all the World ſaw but the King, who would not ſee it;

                     <p>However, the King at this time was not pleaſed with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults

                     <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> having compleated their Fleet, upon the <hi>9th</hi> of

in St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Park,</hi> when a Gentleman whiſpered to me,
That the <hi>Dutch</hi> were enter'd the River. Then the King had fed
his Ducks, and was walking on the Weſt-ſide of the <hi>Park;</hi> and as
we walked, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> overtook us, and met the King at the

he had ſhot a Duck, and ſuch a Dog fetch'd it: and ſo they
walk'd on till the King came to St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Houſe,</hi> and there the
King ſaid to the Prince, <hi>Let's go ſee</hi> Cambridg <hi>and</hi> Kendall, (the

<hi>White-hall,</hi> he found all in an Uproar, the Counteſs of <hi>Caſtlemain</hi>
(as 'twas ſaid) bewailing above all others, that ſhe ſhould be the

                     <p>Hereupon the Duke of <hi>Albemarle</hi> was poſted down to <hi>Chatham,</hi>
where, in a Council of War, it was reſolved to ſink all the Ships;
but as they lay, there was not Water enough. The <hi>Dutch</hi> found
an eaſy Paſſage, after they broke the Boom which lay croſs the
River; for no Fort was then finiſhed at <hi>Sheerneſs,</hi> and that at <hi>

ruin'd for want of Repair: however, the Duke put ſome Guns
into it, which ſhooting high, little damaged the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage:
So the <hi>Dutch</hi> fired the <hi>Royal James, London,</hi> and <hi>Royal Oak;</hi>
and the <hi>Henry</hi> being afloat, run ſo violently upon <hi>Rocheſter-bridg,</hi>
the Tide forcing her, as endanger'd the breaking of it; and the

                     </p>
                     <p>I was then at <hi>London,</hi> and alſo in the Plague and Fire Years,
yet in neither did I obſerve ſuch Conſternation and Confuſion in
the Looks of all Men as at this time, and with great Cauſe: for if
the <hi>Dutch</hi> had then come up to <hi>London,</hi> they had found all open
to them; not one Gun mounted at <hi>Tilbury Fort,</hi> nor one Frigat
ready in the River; ſo as they might have forced all the Ships in
the River up to the Bridg, and there have burnt them; which
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:60932:240"/>
would certainly have fired the <hi>Tower,</hi> and all the Suburbs Weſt
to <hi>Black-wall,</hi> as well as <hi>Southwark,</hi> below Bridg.</p>
                     <p>Nor were the Ships at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> in more Safety; and the
<hi>Dutch</hi> had Ships enow to have made both Attempts at the ſame
time; but whilſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> lay loitering below <hi>Sheerneſs,</hi> the

or at any time before, upon any Cauſe or Pretence whatſoever, be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
expunged, and buried in Oblivion.</p>
                     <p>So that by this Article the Buſineſs of <hi>Amboyna</hi> is buried, and
never to be called in Queſtion; which <hi>Oliver,</hi> tho he made Peace
with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> would not do, but was referred to the <hi>Cantons</hi> of
<hi>Switzerland,</hi> who never did any thing in it.</p>
                     <p>By this Article the <hi>Dutch</hi> had <hi>Polloroon</hi> (out of which they had
expelled our <hi>East-India</hi> Company during this War) confirmed to
them, whereby they became ſole Proprietors of the Spice-Trade, as
well in <hi>Europe,</hi> as other Parts of the <hi>Indies, Arabia,</hi> and <hi>Perſia:</hi>
And by this Article they were to have the Plantation of <hi>Surinam</hi>
reſtored to them, becauſe taken by Sir <hi>John Harman</hi> after the
Treaty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> 4th <hi>Article is,</hi> That all Ships, Goods, and Moveables,
which at any time had come into the Power of either Party, or their
Subjects, ſhould remain in the preſent Poſſeſſors thereof, without any
Compenſation or Reſtitution for the ſame, without any Exception of
Place, Time, or Things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> 5th <hi>Article was,</hi> That all Actions, Ships, and Pretenſions
whatſoever for the ſame, ſhould remain void, obliterated, diſannulled,
and nothing moved thereupon hereafter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> 8th <hi>Article is,</hi> That under the foreſaid Renunciation, and Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation,
all Letters of Mart, Repriſals, or Counter-Mart, general or
particular, ought to be comprehended and revoked, by virtue of that
Article accordingly, notwithſtanding any Grant to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>This was the Succeſs of the King's Speech to the Parliament,
upon his declaring War againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that as he enter'd into
the War for the Protection, Honour, and Safety of his Subjects,
ſo without theſe he would not make a Peace: and this Benefit
Sir <hi>Edmund Turner</hi> and Mr. <hi>Carew</hi> had of their Letters of Repriſal,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:60932:241"/>
wherein the King granted, That they ſhould ſtand good, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
any Peace to be made with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> until they had
fully reprized their Debt of 151612 <hi>l.</hi> and Charges of Reprizal:
nay their Agents were tried by a Commiſſion out of the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for Piracy, for acting under the ſaid Grant, the Silver Oar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
carried before Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins,</hi> who was very zealous to have
hanged them; but the Common-Law Judges were of another
Opinion, and ſo they did not loſe their Lives, as Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Carew</hi> did their Debts: yet the <hi>French</hi> ſped not ſo well as the
<hi>Dutch</hi> in this Peace, being to reſtore all they had taken in the
<hi>Leeward Iſlands</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now the Steed is ſtoln, the Stable-door is ſhut: for after
the Peace, thouſands of People were preſſed in <hi>London</hi> to finiſh
the Fort at <hi>Sheerneſs;</hi> and it being a terrible aguiſh Time, in an
aguiſh Place, almoſt all fell ſick, and it was deemed by many, that
more died there than in all the <hi>Dutch</hi> War.</p>
                     <p>In this Conſternation, 'twas neceſſary to do ſomething to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
the Parliament and People, and ſo the King ſends for the
Seal from my Lord Chancellor <hi>Hide;</hi> which was no ſooner done,
but the Parliament were as fierce upon him as for the <hi>Dutch</hi> War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
One of his intimate Friends told me, he took Counſel with his
Friends, whether he ſhould ſtay or leave the Kingdom; they all
adviſed him not to ſtay; and ſo he left the Kingdom, yet fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
more Danger than if he had not: for at <hi>Diep,</hi> a Company of
rude Sea-men endeavour'd to have aſſaſſinated him. Thus fell this
great Chancellor and Stateſman, I do not ſay a Sacrifice for either
King or People, having followed the King's Father in all his Wars,
and himſelf in his Exile: yet he lived to ſee two Lord Chancellors
in <hi>England,</hi> and two Lord Keepers alive at the ſame time (no
Argument of the Steadineſs of Counſels after him:) Two were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
as well as he; and the third, with much ado, lived to die
in the Place. A little before his Depoſure (as if he had lived
long enough) that great Standard of Loyalty and true Nobility,
my Lord Treaſurer <hi>Southampton,</hi> died; but ſure ſo upright a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,
or two ſuch honourable Counſellors and Stateſmen, for
their Integrity to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt, and great Underſtanding in
State-Affairs, have not ſince ſucceeded: but they were but two to
too many others, and the King's Inclinations were towards the
other ſide; ſo as neither he, nor my Lord Treaſurer <hi>Southampton</hi>
were preſent at the Council when the War was declared againſt
the <hi>Dutch:</hi> But this Power was in the Wain, and the Torrent run
t'other way.</p>
                     <p>It was time for the <hi>Dutch</hi> to make Peace with <hi>England;</hi> for
this Summer the <hi>French</hi> King, with a mighty Army, was fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Flanders,</hi> and like a Torrent, had ravaged <hi>Artois, Hainault,</hi> and
other parts of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> and taken <hi>Charleroy, Oudenard,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:60932:241"/>
Aeth, Courtray</hi> and <hi>Liſle.</hi> But that we may take a better View of
this War we muſt look back.</p>
                     <p>In the Year 1612 there was a croſs Marriage between <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII.
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> IV. of <hi>Spain: Lewis</hi> married <hi>Ann, Philip</hi>'s
Siſter, and <hi>Philip</hi> married <hi>Elizabeth, Lewis</hi> his Siſter: By <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
Philip</hi> had <hi>Don Belthazar,</hi> and the <hi>Infanta</hi> married to the
<hi>French</hi> King by the Treaty of the <hi>Pyrenees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Year 1649 <hi>(Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>France</hi> being dead) <hi>Philip</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<hi>Ann</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Third, Emperor, <hi>Philip</hi>'s
own Niece, by whom he had <hi>Charles</hi> the now King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
I do not find whether <hi>Don Belthazar</hi> was dead before the <hi>French</hi>
King married his Siſter, but <hi>Charles</hi> the now King was born about
Nine Months after the <hi>Pyrenean Treaty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By the <hi>Pyrenean Treaty,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, by all that they call
ſacred in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by all the Clauſes the Wit of
Man could expreſs to avoid Evaſion, diſclaimed all Right or Title
to <hi>Spain,</hi> or any part of it, in the Right of the <hi>Infanta;</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
dying in the Year 1665, the <hi>French</hi> King did engage his
Faith and Royal Word to the Queen by the Marqueſs <hi>De la Fuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi>
that he would Religiouſly keep the Peace, and continue a
faithful Friendſhip with her and her Son during his Minority;
nay, after the Eruption by the <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Arch-Biſhop
of <hi>Ambrun</hi> did, <hi>in Verbo Sacerdotis,</hi> proteſt and vow to
the Queen, that his Maſter (the <hi>French</hi> King) would never break
with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or invade his Dominions during his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority.</p>
                     <p>By this time the <hi>Dauphin</hi> (I think) was about Six Years old,
and his Father, to cover his Hypocriſy and Perfidy, pretended
that the Women of <hi>Brabant,</hi> by the firſt Venter, inherit before
the Males of the ſecond: but you ſhall ſee <hi>Brabant</hi> flow over all
the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands;</hi> and therefore no Act of his could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> who was born of <hi>Elizabeth, Philip</hi>'s firſt Wife;
which vain Pretenſion was throughly confuted by the renowned
States-man, the Baron <hi>de Iſola,</hi> in his excellent Treatiſe termed
<hi>The Buckler of State and Juſtice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However, about four Days after the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Ambrun</hi>'s
Proteſtation, the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> had notice of a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
by the <hi>French</hi> King, that he had ſo fully proved his Son's
Title, that he did not think himſelf obliged to ſpend any time in
unprofitable Conteſts about it; yet not to make War, but to take
Friendly Poſſeſſion of what was ſo juſtly due to the <hi>Dauphin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Never was <hi>Spain</hi> at ſo low an Ebb, and unable to make Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the <hi>French,</hi> as at this time: for beſides our King's giving
up <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> and the breaking of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army at
the Fight at <hi>Elvas</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> which ſhould have defended <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
the War ſtill continued there, where the <hi>French</hi> by a Treaty
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:60932:242"/>
with <hi>Portugal,</hi> (contrary to the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty) were to have all
the Port Towns taken from the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> The Buchaneers at
<hi>Jamaica</hi> plagued the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the Returns of their Plate-Fleet,
and plundered and fired many of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Towns upon the firm
Land: And <hi>Don John</hi> (the King's Baſtard Brother) and the Queen,
were at higheſt Diſcord about her Confeſſor <hi>Nitard,</hi> ſo as <hi>Don
John</hi> refuſed to accept of the Government of <hi>Flanders</hi> again to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the <hi>French.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here 'tis obſervable how much the <hi>French</hi> King's Ambition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
beyond his Zeal to Religion; for in 1665 and 1666, the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
had been treating with him, to ſend an Army into <hi>Ireland</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in a deſigned Rebellion againſt the King, which this
Year was brought to Maturity; and the <hi>French</hi> King promiſed to
ſend them Forty Thouſand Men to land on St. <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Day, in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt:</hi>
But he kept his Promiſe no better with them to aſſiſt them,
than he did his Oath at the <hi>Pyrenean Treaty,</hi> not to aſſiſt the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe,</hi>
and to the Queen Regent in <hi>Spain,</hi> not to invade any of
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions during the Minority of the King.</p>
                     <p>The King either ſtung with the Succeſs of his Mother's Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that the <hi>Dutch</hi> would put out no Fleet this Year, or at
this time angry with his Brother of <hi>France,</hi> for the Ravages he had
made upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> whereby the King's
Cuſtoms were much leſſened; or it may be, having ſome Seeds
of the wholſome Counſels which the Chancellor <hi>Hide</hi> and Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
<hi>Southampton</hi> had infuſed into him, how dangerous it would be
to <hi>England</hi> as well as <hi>Holland</hi> for the <hi>French</hi> to make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
in <hi>Flanders;</hi> ſent to Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> his then Reſident
at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> to take joint Meaſures with the States for reſtraining
the Progreſs of the <hi>French</hi> Conqueſts in <hi>Flanders:</hi> This was in
<hi>January 1667/8.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> Progreſs in <hi>Flanders</hi> more nearly concerned the
<hi>Dutch</hi> than the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> being the Barrier
to ſecure the United <hi>Netherlands</hi> from ſinking under the Power of
<hi>France,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Dutch States</hi> readily complied with Sir
<hi>William</hi>'s Propoſals, and Sir <hi>William</hi> waited upon the King to give
him an Account of his Negotiation; and within 5 Days after was
ſent back with Powers to conclude a ſtricter Defenſive League than
that at <hi>Breda</hi> between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> either by Mediation or
Force, to ſtop the further Progreſs of the <hi>French</hi> Army in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Provinces: And becauſe the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſoon after entred into it, it was
called the Triple Alliance. This preſerved what the <hi>French</hi> had
left untaken, and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was forced to ſit down by the Loſs.</p>
                     <p>But whatever the <hi>Spaniard</hi> loſt by the <hi>French</hi> Ravages, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
gained this Benefit by it: That one <hi>Brewer</hi> (whoſe Parents
were ſaid to be <hi>Engliſh)</hi> with about fifty <hi>Walloons,</hi> who wrought
and died Fine Woollen Cloths, came into <hi>England;</hi> and the King,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:60932:242"/>
after the Example of two of his wiſeſt and moſt renowned Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
<hi>Edward</hi> III. and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> entertain'd them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our Barbarous Law, or rather Uſage, againſt Foreigners
partaking the Benefit of Natural-born <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and by them the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> in a few Years time were inſtructed to make and dye fine
woollen Cloths cheaper by 40 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> than they could do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
not only to the Benefit of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at home, but in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Vent abroad; which before the <hi>Dutch</hi> had.</p>
                     <p>I think it was this Year the <hi>French</hi> ſell into the <hi>Franche County</hi>
of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and took <hi>Dole</hi> and <hi>Beſanzon:</hi> but this being a Barrier
to the <hi>Swiſs</hi> againſt the <hi>French</hi> Power, as the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi>
are to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Swiſs</hi> recalled their Subjects out of the
<hi>French</hi> Service, and ordered the levying Sixty Thouſand Men to
expel the <hi>French</hi> out of the County of <hi>Burgundy:</hi> and now it was
not time for the <hi>French</hi> King to contend againſt the Triple League,
and the <hi>Swiſs</hi> too, ſo he gave up <hi>Dole</hi> and <hi>Beſanzon</hi> again to the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> and withdrew his Forces out of the County. Thus was
<hi>Spain</hi> ſaved by others when they could not help themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The baniſhing the Chancellour <hi>Clarendon</hi> did palliate, but the
Triple League reconciled all Difference between the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
as if no <hi>Dutch War,</hi> or Miſcarriages had been; and for the
Triple League, they granted the King a Treble Supply, <hi>viz. 20
Car.</hi> II. <hi>c. 1. 301000 l.</hi> upon Wines and Liquors: Secondly, an
additional Duty of 8 <hi>l. per</hi> Tun on <hi>French</hi> Wines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 12 <hi>l. per</hi>
Tun on <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wines for eight Years, which amounted to
560000 <hi>l.</hi> this was the 22 <hi>Car.</hi> II. And alſo, <hi>cap.</hi> 3. an Act for ſale
of the Fee Farm Rents to the Value of 1300000 <hi>l.</hi>

                     <p>However the Devil will play at ſmall Games rather than ſtand out:

<pb n="474" facs="tcp:60932:243"/>
and Treaty at <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> from taking more Towns in the
<hi>Spaniſh Netherlands:</hi> Yet he exacted great Contributions from the
Dutchies of <hi>Limburgh</hi> and <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> and confiſcated the Eſtates
of thoſe in his Conqueſts, who would not forſwear their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and endeavoured to ſurprize the Town
of <hi>Hainault.</hi> And tho by the <hi>Pyrenean Treaty</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
was to be reſtor'd to his Dutchy; yet the Duke, tho a Friend
to the King, was rejected from entring into the Triple League,
which he endeavoured, and therefore incurred the <hi>French</hi> King's
Diſpleaſure, who in the Year 1669, ſeized upon the poor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of his Country, and ordered one of his Generals to ſeize
his Perſon, and bring him either dead or alive. And tho by the
Treaty of <hi>Breda</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King was to reſtore the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to
their Plantations in St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> had taken
from them, yet hitherto he refuſed to do it.</p>
                     <p>In this trifling, which the Hector of <hi>France</hi> did only to keep his
Hand in ure, he did not ſleep otherways; the Triple League
ſtuck ſore in his Conſcience, which, unleſs broken, would ſet
Bounds to his boundleſs Ambition: In its infant State Monſieur
<hi>Colbert,</hi> in the firſt Year, had made ſome Steps towards it; but
the next Year made ſuch Advances, that he had almoſt brought
the Deſtruction of it to Perfection: To facilitate this hopeful
Project, <hi>Madam,</hi> the King's beloved Siſter, came in <hi>June
1670,</hi> to <hi>Dover,</hi> with full Powers to conclude this deſired Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
                     <p>The King was not long behind, but with equal Deſire, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Affection, meets his Siſter, where all things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
which, tho as dark as Hell, yet were as ſecret as Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,
which would have no Light, but by their Conſequences:
and that this well-laid Deſign might not be forgotten, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
left her Woman, Madam <hi>Carwel,</hi> after Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
with the King to put him in mind of it: but the Princeſs
was unhappy in this; for <hi>Monſieur</hi> her Husband entertained a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Jealouſy in his frantick Brain, that ſomething elſe beſides this
hopeful Project was deſigned by the Princeſs; ſo that though
ſhe were in perfect Health, and never more pleaſed than when
here, yet, upon her Return, ſhe in the Glory of her Age, but
Twenty ſix Years old, died ſuddenly, ſo that the Cauſe of her
Death was as dark as the Deſign ſhe came for.</p>
                     <p>But there is neither Siſter, Father or Mother with Kings and

both Kings Ratification of it.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon the <hi>French</hi> King deſcended from his Stiffneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> their Grounds in St. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> to Sir <hi>Charles
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:60932:243"/>
Wheeler,</hi> yet deſtroy'd all the Plantations, plundered and carried
away all that was portable, laid the whole Country waſte, and
left it in a much worſe Condition than if it had never been
planted.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> King by his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Penſioners, did not only keep
the Emperor and Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> out of being deſirous to enter
into the Triple League, but he enters into a ſtricter League with
the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Collen,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> (two Princes
of the Empire) againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and now began to ſit out a greater
Fleet of Men of War than ever any <hi>French</hi> King did before: Nor
were the <hi>Dutch</hi> behind-hand, but made proportionable Advances,
not doubting but the King would make good his Proportion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

                     <p>Upon the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1670, the Parliament met again, and

that beſides the triple Alliance, he had made many advantagious
Alliances, both for Security and Profit of Trade with the <hi>Swede,

keep equal Pace with them, which could not be done without
great Supplies, which muſt be ſpeedily granted; for the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to put an End of this Seſſion before <hi>Chriſtmas:</hi> but the

not permitted to be printed, yet you may read it at large in
Mr. <hi>Marvel</hi>'s <hi>Growth of Popery:</hi> But whatever Treaties of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
were made with other Princes, the Keeper finds none with
<hi>France,</hi> where neither the advantagious Treaty made by <hi>Oliver</hi> was
obſerved, nor any new one made, but the <hi>French</hi> King did uſe the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> with all imaginable Oppreſſions, without any Redreſs from
the King.</p>
                     <p>However, this Speech wrought ſo pathetically with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that they gave the King one Shilling in the Pound of the
real Value of all the Lands of <hi>England</hi> for one Year, and an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
Exciſe upon Beer and Ale for ſix Years, and the Law-Bill
for nine Years; which three Bills were computed at two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
and a half.</p>
                     <p>And now this dark Deſign, founded in ſuch deep Diſſimulation,
Hypocriſy, and Perfidiouſneſs, as <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> would have been
aſhamed of and bluſh'd at, begins to receive Light: For, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
having granted the King the Aids, were in Conſequence
prorogued, and did not meet to act till the fourth of <hi>February 167 1/2.</hi>
But in regard that not only the extirpating the Proteſtant Religion,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:60932:244"/>
but the Subverſion of the Weſtern Parts of <hi>Europe</hi> was now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,
which extended as far as the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, and the Bounds of
the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Tartar</hi> Empires, we will be a little particular in it.
But what is moſt amazing is, that the King, in appearance a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
and a free independent King, ſo uſed by the <hi>French</hi> King in
his Exile, and ſince his Reſtoration, ſhould be ſo forward in join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with a Faithleſs and Boundleſs Ambitious Neighbouring Prince,
which if his Deſign had ſucceeded, had involved the Kingdoms of
<hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> in the ſame Condition with the reſt
of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Vizard-Mask under which the Popiſh Party covered their
Hypocriſy, in propagating their Catholick Cauſe [for plain-deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
muſt never be expected in it] in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's
time, was <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> which then had the Aſcendant in <hi>Laud</hi>'s
Regency: but ſince the King's Reſtoration the Proteſtant Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
being ſo fiercely proſecuted by the Parliament, it was judged
that the diſpenſing with Penal Laws againſt Diſſenters from the
Church of <hi>England</hi> would conjoin the Proteſtant Diſſenters Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
with the Popiſh; and this not only appeared by Practice, but
by Deſign in <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters to Father <hi>Ferier</hi> and <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> the
<hi>French</hi> King's Confeſſors.</p>
                     <p>As before the firſt <hi>Dutch</hi> War, the King iſſued out his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Indulgence for diſpenſing with the Penal Laws in Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Affairs in the Interval of the ſitting of the Parliament, ſo
did he before the ſecond War. It ſeems to me that the Deſigners
of this War got ſome ſecret Oath or Promiſe from the King that
he ſhould not do the like again; for the King told the Houſe of
Commons he would ſtand by his Declaration of Indulgence, and
ſure nothing but Queen <hi>Money</hi> would have got him off.</p>
                     <p>However, theſe Conſpirators were more zealous than politick;
for before the King iſſued out his Declaration of Indulgence in
<hi>England,</hi> upon the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 1671, he iſſued out his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein he granted general Licence to all
Papiſts to live in Corporations, exerciſe Trades there, and enjoy
the ſame Privileges as other Subjects ought to do; which was a
greater Privilege than his Proteſtant Subjects had, for by their
Charter, all who were not free of the Corporations could not have
the Benefit of their Privileges.</p>
                     <p>But that the Catholick Deſign might take deeper Root and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Sons being dead, and the Princeſſes
his Daughters being bred up in the Proteſtant Religion, Care muſt
be taken to eſtabliſh the Popiſh for the time to come; for which it
was expedient the Duke ſhould marry ſome Popiſh Princeſs, and
to this end the Arch-Dutcheſs of <hi>Inſpruck</hi> was propounded, and a
Treaty entred into upon it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="477" facs="tcp:60932:244"/>
But tho the Princeſs's Religion pleaſed the <hi>French</hi> King, yet the
Intereſt this Marriage would bring with it did not: So that tho
the Treaty were far advanced, yet the <hi>French</hi> King (who ruled all
the Roaſt) propounded the Princeſs of <hi>Modena</hi> (the Daughter of
a little <hi>Italian</hi> Prince, and a Dependant of the <hi>French</hi> King's, yet
had a great Intereſt in the Court of <hi>Rome)</hi> and this, againſt all
Endeavours of the Parliament, and to the Diſhonour of the Treaty
with the Arch-Dutcheſs, prevailed, the <hi>French</hi> King having adopted
her a Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> and given her a Portion.</p>
                     <p>But while theſe Deſigns are laid in the dark here in <hi>England,</hi>
the <hi>French</hi> King, bare-faced by his Ambaſſador at <hi>Vienna,</hi> in a
ſolemn Speech declared, that his Maſter had undertaken the War
againſt <hi>Holland</hi> for propagating the Catholick Cauſe, and that all
good Chriſtians were bound to join with him to extirpate Hereſy,
and that he would reſtore all his Conqueſts to re-eſtabliſh the true
Worſhip baniſh'd out of the <hi>Holland</hi>'s (meaning the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands)</hi>
Territories, which you may read more at large in
Mr. Secretary <hi>Trevor</hi>'s Appeal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now let's ſee how agreeable theſe Mens Morals were to their
Religious Pretences in laying the Scene for this deſigned <hi>Dutch</hi>
War. The Treaſury, ſince the Death of my Lord Treaſurer
<hi>Southampton,</hi> was managed by Commiſſioners; and if the Aids
granted by the Parliament were not ſufficient for carrying on the
King's Deſigns, the <hi>French</hi> King is to ſupply him further: but
things were not ripe enough yet for theſe Monies to be returned
into the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> leſt they might give cauſe of Suſpicion; and
therefore between ſix and ſeven hundred thouſand Pounds were
received by Mr. <hi>Chiffins,</hi> he to have two Pence in the Pound, to
be diſpoſed of as the King ſhall order. If you doubt this, you
may examine Mr. <hi>Chiffins</hi>'s Accounts when he was adviſed to paſs
them, and take his <hi>Quietus</hi> out of the <hi>Exchequer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tho by the Defenſive League between the King and States
when the Triple League was entred into, the King and States
were mutually engaged to ſupply each other with a certain Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Men and Ships in caſe of any Foreign Invaſion upon either;
yet now the King hath Subſides given him by the <hi>French</hi> King to
join with him againſt <hi>Holland,</hi> which by the Defenſive Alliance the
King was obliged to aſſiſt.</p>
                     <p>The King who was ſo great in the Love of his Subjects and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
for the Triple League, and had received ſuch vaſt Sums
for it, now at the Inſtance of the <hi>French</hi> King ſends Mr. <hi>Henry
Coventry</hi> to the Court of <hi>Sweden</hi> to diſſolve it, which he did
ſo effectually, that that King not only ſtood Neuter at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but in it joined with the <hi>French</hi>
King againſt the Confederates; and this Succeſs Mr. <hi>Coventry</hi> had,
that for this Buſineſs which put all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> into a Flame, he
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:60932:245"/>
was by the King made principal Secretary of State, and it may be
preſented with his fine Ranger's Place in <hi>Enfield-Chaſe</hi> too, and
that perhaps with thrice more by the <hi>French</hi> King: Whereas
Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> who was the principal Inſtrument in the Peace
at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> loſt 2200 <hi>l.</hi> by it, and his only Recompence was to
be Secretary of State in Mr. <hi>Conventry</hi>'s Place, if Sir <hi>William</hi> would
give him 10000 <hi>l.</hi> for it.</p>
                     <p>The Triple League thus diſſolved, all Obſtacles which might
retard the Progreſs of this pious Work muſt be removed: And
now my Lord-keeper <hi>Bridgman</hi> having done by his Speech the
Conſpirators Work for Money, has done his own too, and is turn'd
out of his Place; and my Lord <hi>Aſhley Cooper,</hi> Chancellor of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi>
is made Lord Chancellor of <hi>England;</hi> and Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury;</hi>
Mr. <hi>Clifford,</hi> (after Lord <hi>Clifford)</hi> Lord High-Treaſurer of <hi>England;</hi>
and my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> Chamberlain to the King's Houſhold, and
Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Trevor</hi> diſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the Committee of Foreign Affairs; ſo as the <hi>CABAL,</hi>
viz. <hi>Clifford, Aſhley, Buckingham, Arlington</hi> and <hi>Lauderdale</hi> govern
all.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Reſult of this ſacred Conclave, was the ſhutting up of
the Exchequer, wherein the Bankers (who formerly had furniſhed
the King with mighty Sums of Money at extorſive Intereſt) had
lodged between 13 and 1400000 <hi>l.</hi> of the Subjects Money; this
was in <hi>January 167 1/2.</hi> One would think theſe Monies added to
the Aids granted in the laſt Seſſion of Parliament, with thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from <hi>France,</hi> might have carried on the War againſt the
<hi>Dutch</hi> on the King's Part; but to make ſure, the Fleet for which
the Parliament gave ſuch vaſt Sums, to be equal with the <hi>French</hi>
or <hi>Dutch,</hi> is ſet out under Sir <hi>Robert Holmes</hi> to ſurprize the <hi>Dutch
Smirna</hi>-Fleet, which he vainly attempted the thirteenth and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>March 167 1/2;</hi> and to ſanctify ſo Herotick an Act; at this
very time the Declaration of Indulgence was printed and publiſhed
the fifteenth.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> King having gotten the King into his Net<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let's ſee
how he uſed him: The <hi>French</hi> King openly declar'd, that 'twas
none of his Quarrel, and that he only engaged in it out of reſpect
to his Perſon, and therefore before any War was declared, the
King muſt firſt break the Peace, by the Attempt upon the <hi>Dutch
Smirna</hi>-Fleet.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Dutch,</hi> alarm'd at the Attempt upon their <hi>Smirna</hi>-Fleet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and being in no Condition to reſiſt both Kings, ſent Deputies to
both to know upon what Terms they would agree to Peace: Thoſe
ſent to our King were denied Audience, and kept at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi>
till it were known what the <hi>French</hi> King's Pleaſure was; but thoſe
ſent to the <hi>French</hi> King had Anſwer, That what the King had
was his own, and what he ſhould conquer ſhould be his without
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:60932:245"/>
an Equivalent, and declared the <hi>States</hi> might deal with <hi>England</hi>
as they pleaſed, and come off as cheap as they could, becauſe by
their Treaty they were not bound to procure them any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.
Yet, all this the King as patiently ſubmitted to now, as
before he ſuffered one <hi>Marſilly</hi> to be broken on the Wheel at <hi>Paris,</hi>
without one word from him in his behalf, for being his Agent to
the <hi>Swiſs,</hi> to invite them to join in the <hi>Guaranty</hi> of <hi>Aix;</hi> who
upon the Scaffold had twenty Queſtions asked him in relation to
his Majeſty's Perſon, and a ſtrict Enquiry of the Particulars that
paſſed between the King and him; all which you may read at
large in Mr. Secretary <hi>Trevor</hi>'s Appeal: And this pitiful Story
you may find in a little Treatiſe termed <hi>Colbert</hi>'s <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> printed
at <hi>Cologn,</hi> 1684.</p>
                     <p>I find little difference in the Cauſes of this War by theſe two
Kings. The <hi>French</hi> King's was, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> had acted in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
to his Glory, but ſays not wherein. The King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s
was, the <hi>Dutch</hi> had not yielded him the Honour due to his
Flag.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cabal</hi> ſought for a fourfold Cauſe of this War, the Inſults
upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, the detaining the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Planters in <hi>Surinam</hi> againſt the Treaty at <hi>Breda,</hi> and horrid
Pictures in Defamation of his Majeſty, and his Flag.</p>
                     <p>To this purpoſe the Committee for the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company was
ſummoned to ſhew Cauſe: who anſwer'd and gave it under their
Hands, That ſince the Treaty at <hi>Breda</hi> they knew no Cauſe, nor as
yet the <hi>Dutch</hi> could pretend to no more than was granted by it,
they having not as yet aſſiſted the young King of <hi>Bantam</hi> againſt
his Father, and made uſe of the young King's Name to expel the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Factories from the Pepper Trade, as before they had the
Spice Trade.</p>
                     <p>For detaining the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Planters in <hi>Surinam;</hi> it was anſwer'd,
the Planters were not willing to forſake their Subſiſtence, and be
turned into the wild World to ſeek it; and that the <hi>Dutch</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
their Part with Mr. Secretary <hi>Trevor,</hi> and therefore it was
no fault of theirs if it were not obſerv'd; nor did they hinder
them when they were tranſplanted to repair the Ruin of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Plantation in St. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> made by the <hi>French.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the Pictures the <hi>Dutch</hi> anſwered, they knew of none, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
one Medal, which might be liable to any ſuch Conſtruction;
but ſo ſoon as they knew of it, they cauſed the Stamp to be
broken.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For that of the Flag, the Caſe ſtood thus: the</hi> Dutch <hi>having fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up a Fleet of Men of War in jealouſy of the</hi> French, <hi>were riding
near their own Coaſt, when one of the King's Yachts diſcharged
a Gun at the Admiral to ſtrike Sail; which the Admiral not doing,
was the cauſe of the Breach for the War, tho the</hi> States <hi>diſown'd
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:60932:246"/>
the Refuſal, and offer'd to make any Satisfaction the King ſhould
require. But it is the End which crowns the Work in every Act,
and therefore the Declaration concludes,</hi> That notwithſtanding this
War, the King will ſupport the Treaty at <hi>Aix la Chapelle</hi> according to the
Scope and Intent of it, and preſerve the Ends of it inviolable: As if the
getting the <hi>Swede</hi> out of it, and joining with the <hi>French</hi> againſt the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> diametrically contrary to it, were the Support of that Treaty;
or that the ſubduing <hi>Holland,</hi> ſo that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould be Lord on
both ſides of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> could be to protect them againſt
the Power of the <hi>French.</hi> Good God! Did theſe Men believe Heaven
or a God! But all Moral Vertues, and whatſoever may be called ſacred,
muſt give way to the Advancement of the Catholick Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>By this time the <hi>French</hi> King by the Benefit of the Act of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,
<hi>Oliver</hi>'s Peace with <hi>France,</hi> and War with <hi>Spain,</hi> our King's
ſupine Negligence, and the Addition of twelve great Men of War
built by the <hi>Dane</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> in the former <hi>Dutch</hi> War, had got a
Navy equal to the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>Engliſh;</hi> yet how to damage or deſtroy
theſe, and to inſtruct his Men to fight, is the <hi>French</hi> Game now to
be play'd: And therefore for this time the <hi>French</hi> permitted the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
to have the Red Flag, and the <hi>French</hi> were content with the
White: Yet here it's obſervable, That in all the former Fights
with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> when the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dane</hi> joined againſt the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
except that when the Fleet was divided, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> put the
<hi>Dutch</hi> to flight; whereas in all the Fights (which were four) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>French</hi> joined the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came off with more
Loſs than the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Things thus order'd, the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was Admiral of the
Red, or the whole Fleet, Monſieur <hi>D'Eſtree</hi> of the White, and
my Lord of <hi>Sandwich</hi> of the Blue: And thus they rode at Anchor
in <hi>Sould-Bay</hi> the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1672, the Wind blowing at North-Eaſt,
a ſtiff Gale: And upon that day there was a mighty Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> on board the Fleet by the Flag-Officers;
and at the ſame time, the other Captains in imitation of their
Admiral, went on Shoar to perform the ſame at <hi>Alborough, Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
and <hi>Sould.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In their Jollity on Board, my Lord <hi>Sandwich</hi> (not at good Terms
either with the Duke or with the <hi>French)</hi> ſaid, that as the Wind
ſtood, the Fleet rode in danger of being ſurprized by the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
and therefore thought it adviſeable to weigh Anchor, and get out
to Sea: The Duke retorted upon him, as if this had been ſaid out
of Fear, which the next day 'twas thought was the loſs of the Earl,
and the brave Ship the <hi>Prince Royal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Sacrifice ended, and when all were <hi>Vino ſomno<expan>
                              <am>
                                 <g ref="char:abque"/>
                              </am>
                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan> ſepulti,</hi> the
Thunder of the Cannon of the Scout-Ships about two in the
Morning, gave Notice that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet was approaching to call
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to an account for their Yeſterday's Jollity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="481" facs="tcp:60932:246"/>
Now all things were in Confuſion, our drowſy Officers were in
no caſe to go to Counſel, nor had time for weighing Anchor, the
Cables therefore were cut to avoid being burnt by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fire-Ships,
and the Long-boats were ſent near the Shoar to wait upon
their ſleepy Officers. Here was no time to draw into a Line of
Battel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it happened that about four in the Morning a Calm
fell, which continued till after ſix, whereby the Captains had time
to get on Board, tho not to conſider how to fight: And I have
heard experienced Sea-men ſay, if this Calm had not happened,
the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet had been in danger to be ſtranded or
burnt.</p>
                     <p>The Coaſt of <hi>Sould-Bay</hi> lies near North and South, the North-moſt
part inclining into the Eaſt, called <hi>Eaſtonneſs;</hi> being the moſt
Eaſtern Part of <hi>England,</hi> but towards the South it inclines into
the Weſt.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> lay South, the Duke's Squadron in the midſt, and
my Lord <hi>Sandwich</hi> on the North; ſo as the <hi>French</hi> had moſt Sea-room,
and the Blue leaſt.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Dutch</hi> engaged the Fleets, the Wind was South-Eaſt;
and the <hi>Dutch</hi> did not fight cloſe with the <hi>French,</hi> yet the <hi>French</hi>
ſhot furiouſly, but their Shot fell ſhort: But with great Courage
the <hi>Dutch</hi> fell upon the Duke's Squadron, and more fiercely upon
the Blue, the <hi>Dutch</hi> having near one third more than the <hi>Engliſh;</hi>
and thus the Fight held till about 11, when the <hi>French</hi> by this
time might have weathered the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and diſingaged the <hi>Engliſh;</hi>
but did not: Now the Wind had got North-Eaſt, and <hi>Van Gent,</hi>
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Vice-Admiral, with three Men of War, whereof one lay
acroſs his Haulſer, ſorely diſtreſſed my Lord <hi>Sandwich,</hi> when
Sir <hi>Joſeph Jordan</hi> (Vice-Admiral of the Blue) who might have
diſengaged the Earl, ſailed to the Red to aſſiſt the Duke, and it's
believed the Earl might have done ſo too, if his great Spirit could
have digeſted his yeſterday's Taunt: So this noble Earl and his
brave Ship periſhed; with many young Gentlemen beſides Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
Towards two the <hi>Engliſh</hi> got the Weather-gage of the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> and then the Fight ended; nor did the <hi>French</hi> ſerve the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> better in any of the other Sea-Fights, which let others
tell, I have had enough of this.</p>
                     <p>Tho the <hi>Dutch</hi> could thus cope with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> at
Sea, yet they found another kind of Task of it by Land: And
let's look back a little, and ſee how this Calamity came upon them,
and ſome things we are neceſſitated to reſume here, tho men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before upon another occaſion, to make Matters more plain
and obvious.</p>
                     <p>There is no Man converſant in the Stories of thoſe Times, but
underſtands that the Foundation of the <hi>Dutch States</hi> was laid by
<hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (Father of <hi>Maurice,</hi> and <hi>Henry Frederick,</hi>
                        <pb n="482" facs="tcp:60932:247"/>
Grand-father of King <hi>William)</hi> who and his Brothers all loſt
their Lives in eſtabliſhing it, with the Aſſiſtance of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> however ſhe made uſe of the <hi>Dutch</hi> to curb
the aſpiring Dominion of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> knew their Nature ſo well
as never to truſt them, and therefore bridled them by keeping the
<hi>Brill, Ramakins</hi> and <hi>Fluſhing</hi> (the Keys of the <hi>Maeze</hi> and <hi>Scheld)</hi>
in her Dominion.</p>
                     <p>The Queen in aſſiſting the <hi>Dutch</hi> made one Article, That two
ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men as ſhe ſhould name, ſhould ſit and vote in their
States. But the <hi>Dutch</hi> growing mighty by her Aſſiſtance, and
withal ungrateful, formed a private Cabal at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where
they managed all the ſecret Affairs of their State; and in this
<hi>Barnvelt</hi> was the Head.</p>
                     <p>The Queen incenſed herewith, in the Year 1598 called the
States to an account for all the Monies ſhe had expended in their
Support, which was 8000000 Crowns, or two Millions Sterling;
the <hi>Dutch</hi> pleaded Poverty, and their Inability of Payment, and
beſeeched her, that as ſhe excelled all others in Glory and Power,
ſo ſhe would continue her Mercy and Pity to theſe diſtreſſed
States.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Queen anſwered them,</hi> She had been often deluded by their
deceitful Supplications, and ungrateful Actions, and pretences of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
and that they bare no Reverence to Superiors, nor took any Care
but for themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The States were confounded with this Anſwer, and to appeaſe
her, promiſed to pay her the whole Debt after the War, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the continuance of it to pay her 100000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and
that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gariſons in the <hi>Brill, Ramakins</hi> and <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> ſhould
be paid by the States.</p>
                     <p>The Queen, tho not much truſting the States, yet wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,
that if ſhe refuſed theſe Offers, the States might alter,
and put themſelves under the Protection of <hi>France,</hi> now at Peace
with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> by the Peace at <hi>Vervins</hi> the Year before, or
that they might make a Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> whereby ſhe might loſe
the whole Debt, and Dependance the States had upon her, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
their Terms: But I do not find they ever performed any
of them, except the Payment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in Gariſon in the
Cautionary Towns, which how well they obſerved this, when
they found it their Intereſt not to do it, has been ſaid before.</p>
                     <p>For in the Year 1609, the <hi>Dutch</hi> made a Truce with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi>
for eleven Years, when <hi>Barnvelt, Hugo Grotius,</hi> &amp;c. (Heads
of the <hi>Loveſtein</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> Faction) conſpired how to get rid
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (by whom the <hi>Dutch</hi> became
States.) It's ſaid before how eaſily in King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt's Reign
they got rid of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but their Attempt upon the Prince
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:60932:247"/>
not ſucceeding, <hi>Barnvelt</hi> loſt his Head, and <hi>Grotius</hi> had loſt his
too if he had not fled the Country.</p>
                     <p>But tho <hi>Barnvelt</hi>'s Head was cut off, the Faction did not die
with it; for after the <hi>Dutch</hi> had made Peace with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
at the Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi> 1648, tho in the Life of the then Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> (the King's Grandfather, and the moſt Renowned Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the Time) the <hi>Loveſtein</hi> Faction ſtirred not, yet he dying
within the Year after the Treaty, (I think) they began to play
their Game againſt his Son, a Prince of Lively and Active Courage,
about twenty two Years of Age; and after the Example of <hi>Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velt,</hi>
laid their Foundation by disbanding the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by whoſe
Blood and Valour, under the Conduct of three Princes of <hi>Orange,</hi>
they became States.</p>
                     <p>The Prince, if he ſuffered this, foreſaw his Authority was next
ſtruck at, therefore reſolved to prevent it, and to be before-hand
with the Conſpirators at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where the Scene was laid;
and in great Silence marched within three Hours march of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi>
but the Weather being dark and foggy, the <hi>Hamburgh</hi> Poſt
paſt by the Prince undiſcover'd, and gave the Burghers account of
the near Approach of the Prince, whereupon they opened their
Sluces, and by drowning the Country, ſtopt the Prince's March,
whereby he not only loſt his Deſign, but his Life; for upon the
<hi>24th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1650, he died, they ſay of the Small Pox, leaving
the Princeſs big with Child of the now King <hi>William.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now had the <hi>Loveſtein</hi> Faction a fair Field to play their Game
in, and ſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were disbanded; and having the <hi>Rump</hi> in
<hi>England,</hi> who would be accounted States as well as they, they
thought all cock-ſure; for they were ſure the <hi>Rump</hi> would take as
much Care to keep out the King, as they to ſuppreſs and depoſe
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> born after his Father's Death.</p>
                     <p>But tho the <hi>Loveſtein</hi> Faction thought they had a ſure Game
againſt the Infant Prince, they found they had a hard Task to
play their Game againſt the <hi>Rump,</hi> who next Year made War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; and tho the King offer'd to aſſiſt them againſt the <hi>Rump</hi>
with the Fleet Sir <hi>William Batton</hi> had brought over to him, yet
ſuch was their Averſion to any thing which they thought might
tend to the Benefit of the Prince, that they refuſed the King's
Aſſiſtance, and ſo had been rooted out from being a State, if
<hi>Oliver</hi>'s Deſign of keeping out the King, as well as the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> had not prevented it.</p>
                     <p>After the <hi>Dutch</hi> made Peace with <hi>Oliver,</hi> being before at Peace
with <hi>France, Spain</hi> and the Empire, they now ſet all their Wits
to work to eſtabliſh their Commonwealth without the Prince of
<hi>Orange;</hi> and to make ſure work, God's ſacred Name muſt be
proſtituted to eſtabliſh their Ambition, Perfidiouſneſs and Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
by ſwearing never to admit of a Stadtholder; nor did they
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:60932:248"/>
ſtay here, but impoſed the ſame upon the Prince: The Succeſs
you'll ſoon hear.</p>
                     <p>In this ſeeming Proſperity, they made <hi>John De Witt</hi> (a Fellow
as arrogant and inſolent as ungrateful, factious, and imitating <hi>French</hi>
Modes) Penſionary, or rather Dictator of <hi>Holland;</hi> whoſe chief
Buſineſs was to depreſs the Prince, thereby arrogating ſo much
more to himſelf as he debaſed the Prince and his Authority;
and ſo intent he was hereon, that he neglected to take care of the
Military Diſcipline which was exerciſed in the United Provinces,
whilſt they continued in War with <hi>Spain;</hi> and in all their Gariſons
(eſpecially thoſe upon the <hi>Rhine)</hi> inſtead of the old experienced
Governours, <hi>De Witt</hi> and his Faction put in Burgomaſters Sons, and
Favourites of their Faction oppoſite to the Prince.</p>
                     <p>Now you ſhall ſee <hi>De Witt</hi> and his Faction outwitted by the
<hi>French,</hi> and by the ſame Artifice, by which they had outwitted
our King and his <hi>French</hi> Counſellors.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>De Witt</hi> having lull'd the King into the Security of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
Peace, whereby the <hi>Dutch</hi> got the Opportunity of Firing
our Ships at <hi>Chatham,</hi> and then the Peace at <hi>Breda;</hi> and after
having gotten the King into the Triple Alliance, <hi>De Witt</hi> aſcribed
the Glory of all theſe to himſelf, and became ſo inſolent hereon,
that he became intolerable to all but his own Faction.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> King coop'd up by the Triple Alliance, uſed this
Fineſs to break it; his Penſioners in <hi>England</hi> repreſented to the
King the Inſolence of <hi>De Witt</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> upon the Treaty at
<hi>Breda,</hi> and it may be more than was true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how that the
<hi>French</hi> King had by the Treaty reſtored what he took from the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> in St. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> during the War, whereas the <hi>Dutch</hi>
ſtill detained <hi>Polloroon,</hi> and <hi>Surinam,</hi> though taken in the War;
and how diſhonourable it would be to the King not to vindicate
his Honour herein, and how ready his Brother of <hi>France</hi> would
be to aſſiſt him in it. Theſe Counſels had the Effects before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>In all this Time the <hi>French</hi> King entertained a Treaty with the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> to be a Mediator between the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and them, about
their ſettling Trade and Commerce, but eſpecially in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi>
and the <hi>Dutch</hi> embraced the overture, wherein the <hi>French</hi>
were no more ſincere, than the <hi>Dutch</hi> were with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the
Year 1667, before they fired our Ships in their Harbours.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> lull'd into Security by this Treaty, made no Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
by Land againſt the <hi>French,</hi> either by raiſing an Army, or
fortifying their Gariſons.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the <hi>French</hi> King was thus wheedling <hi>De Witt</hi> and his Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he corrupted one <hi>Mombas,</hi> (a <hi>French-man,</hi> and an Officer of
War in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Service) who betrayed all he could learn or
obſerve to the <hi>French</hi> King; and one <hi>Deſroches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> a Captain in the
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:60932:248"/>
Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Guards, and a Kinſman of <hi>Mombas,</hi> prevailed
with him the Winter before the War broke out, to take a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
into <hi>France,</hi> fully to inform the King of the State of Affairs
in <hi>Holland,</hi> and to take further Inſtructions from the King.</p>
                     <p>Thus the <hi>French</hi> King having made a ſtrict Alliance with the
Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Cologn,</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> (two implacable
Enemies of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> for having filcht ſome Towns from them)
utterly ſurprized the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and marched with a mighty Army to
<hi>Wiſe,</hi> a ſmall City upon the <hi>Maez,</hi> in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Liege,</hi>
where he ſtaid a Fortnight for further Inſtructions from <hi>Mombas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> now rouſed out of their ſtupid Security, to take
Counſel what to do, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s (though they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn
him St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dtholder, yet allowed him a Place among the States)
Counſel was, to put ten Thouſand Men into <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp
with the reſt at <hi>Bodegrave,</hi> whoſe Situation was moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to cover <hi>Holland,</hi> and to abandon the reſt of the Places
above the <hi>Rhine:</hi> Monſieur <hi>Opdam,</hi> and <hi>Celidreck,</hi> who ſpoke for
the Nobility, were of the ſame Opinion.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>De Witt</hi> and his Faction, (little verſed in Military Affairs,
yet ruled all the roaſt) would keep all or loſe all, (and ſo they
did;) and tho the Gariſons upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> were weak, and ill
provided, they made them much weaker, by detaching great
Numbers out of them to put into <hi>Maſtricht.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mombas</hi> gave the <hi>French</hi> King an Account of all this, and how
eaſily all the Towns upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> might fall into his Power.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> King nicks the Opportunity, and paſſed the <hi>Maez,</hi>
and eaſily put to flight ſome Troops which the <hi>Dutch</hi> had advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſly
poſted to oppoſe him, and came before <hi>Orſoy,</hi> which
next day was ſurrendred to him.</p>
                     <p>From thence he marched to <hi>Rhinburgh</hi> and <hi>Doſſery,</hi> both which
ſurrendred, and <hi>Doſſery</hi> without ſhooting one Cannon, for which
the Governour loſt his Head. <hi>Weſel</hi> was delivered to the Prince of
<hi>Conde,</hi> after the Trenches had been opened for a day or two; and
the Governour had a Sword paſſed over his Head by the Hangman,
for making ſo feeble a Defence. <hi>Barick</hi> at the ſame time was taken
by Marſhal <hi>Turenne;</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> advancing, took
<hi>Deudekom, Rees,</hi> and <hi>Emerick,</hi> with the ſame Facility as he had
done <hi>Weſel.</hi> Thus you ſee theſe <hi>De Witts,</hi> (or without Wits) after
their ſupine Negligence of preſerving their Country for twenty
Years, by their Ignorance, or ſtubborn Oppoſition to the Prince,
made the <hi>French</hi> King's Paſſage more eaſy to deſtroy their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                     <p>Here the <hi>French</hi> Arms ſeem to ſtop, for the <hi>Iſſel,</hi> by reaſon of
its Depth, not only forbad the <hi>French</hi> a farther Progreſs, but the
ſtrong Retrenchments on the other Side, where the River is more
fordable; when two Gentlemen of the Neighbourhood of <hi>Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huys</hi>
                        <pb n="486" facs="tcp:60932:249"/>
came to the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> at <hi>Emerick,</hi> and promiſed to ſhew
him a Paſſage over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where there were but one Hundred
Paces ſwimming. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> hereupon, ſent the Count
<hi>De Guiche,</hi> to try the Truth hereof, with the two Men, who
brought the Count oppoſite to the <hi>Tol-huys,</hi> where plunging into
the Water, the Count followed them, and found what they had
ſaid to be true.</p>
                     <p>The Prince hereupon acquainted the <hi>French</hi> King, who came
that Night and ſupped with the Prince, and ordered his Army to
march towards the <hi>Rhine;</hi> whither they came about half an Hour
before day.</p>
                     <p>You have ſeen how eaſy a Conqueſt the <hi>French</hi> King made of all
the Towns on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> by the Advice of theſe witleſs <hi>De Witts:</hi>
now you ſhall ſee how by their Advice, they gave him as eaſy a
Paſſage over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to the Ruin and Loſs of all their Up-land
Towns, and Country on this ſide of it.</p>
                     <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (who in this Exigence <hi>De Witt</hi>'s Faction
permitted to be General) not knowing the Man, ſent <hi>Mombas</hi>
with a Body of Horſe and Foot to guard the Paſſage over the
<hi>Rhine,</hi> thoſe of the <hi>Iſſel</hi> being already ſecured from the Paſſage
of the <hi>French;</hi> but <hi>Mombas</hi> ſeeing this might prevent the <hi>French</hi>
King's Paſſage, wrote to ſome of the Deputies of the States, that
there was no Likelihood of the <hi>French</hi> paſſing the <hi>Rhine,</hi> but if
they pleaſed, he would put himſelf into <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> where he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
they bent their March, which theſe Deputies ordered him
to do.</p>
                     <p>At this time the Prince was gone out from the Camp with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment,
and upon his Return was ſurpriſed with what <hi>Mom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
and the Deputies had done; and forthwith ſent <hi>Wartz</hi> with
ſome Troops to the <hi>Tol-huys,</hi> to intrench himſelf there; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
though <hi>Wartz</hi> made all the Haſte he could, the <hi>French</hi> appeared on
the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which cauſed him to intrench his
Infantry, and cauſed the Cavalry to advance along the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> King cauſed his Cannon to play upon <hi>Wartz</hi>'s Cavalry,
who ſheltered themſelves from the Shot, among the Trees upon
the River, whilſt the <hi>French</hi> paſſed it, though ſome were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in it; which <hi>Wartz</hi>'s Cavalry did not hinder: but when they
perceived ſome of the <hi>French</hi> Troops had come over, and began
to form a Squadron, they came from the Shelter of the Trees; but
inſtead of preſſing upon the <hi>French,</hi> they made a Halt, and made
their Diſcharge at ſo great a Diſtance, as did no Execution; and
thereby gave the <hi>French</hi> an Opportunity of joining thoſe who
were before come over.</p>
                     <p>The Foot divided from the Horſe, and diſcouraged by their baſe
Cowardiſe, and not having time to intrench themſelves, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Quarter, which the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> granted, in caſe they laid
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:60932:249"/>
down their Arms. But the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> advancing to the
Brink of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Retrenchment, fired his Piſtol, whereupon
the <hi>Dutch</hi> diſcharged a whole Volley upon the <hi>French,</hi> and killed
a conſiderable Number of them, whereof <hi>Longueville</hi> was one,
and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> wounded.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon the <hi>French</hi> ſtormed the Trenches, wherein they found
ſome Reſiſtance, and put all to the Sword, but thoſe who eſcaped
by Flight; and took and plundred the Caſtle of <hi>Tol-huys,</hi> and put
all the Iſle of <hi>Betue</hi> under Contribution.</p>
                     <p>The Diſaſter of the <hi>Dutch</hi> ended not here, for the <hi>Dutch</hi> which
guarded the <hi>Iſſel,</hi> fearing the <hi>French</hi> would fall upon them behind,
fled from their Poſts, and left the Paſſage free to the <hi>French;</hi> ſo
as the King in Perſon took <hi>Doesburg</hi> and <hi>Tureſune, Nimeguen, Swoll,
Daventer, Grave, Arnheim, Skinenſchon,</hi> and <hi>Creveceer;</hi> and the
Biſhop of <hi>Munſter, Coventer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whilſt the King beſieged <hi>Doesburg,</hi> the Burgomaſters of <hi>

ſurrendred the Keys to the King, who ſent the Marqueſs of

have bridled <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee what a deplorable State the Ingratitude and
Perfidiouſneſs of theſe Men had brought their Country to; and
you'll ſoon ſee that theſe Men who had ſworn to exclude the
Prince from being Stadtholder, ſhall themſelves be depoſed from
being States, and no other viſible Hopes left to free their Country
from the Calamities which they had brought upon it, but by exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Prince, which they had formerly ſworn never to do.
And 'tis more obſervable, that both the <hi>De Witts</hi> were maſſacred
by the Rage of the People, in whom the <hi>De Witts,</hi> and <hi>Barnvelt</hi>
before them, placed all Soveraignty, and might do as they
pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>To compleat the miſerable Condition of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Provinces,
the King had raiſed an Army commanded by Marſhal <hi>Schomberg,</hi>
(who had done what he could for the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> the
Queen Regent of <hi>Spain,</hi> upon the <hi>French</hi> Irruption into the
<hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> in 1667, having made Peace with <hi>Portugal)</hi>
and Col. <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi> an <hi>Iriſh Papiſt,</hi> Major-General: The Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this Army was, as the Vogue went, That ſince the <hi>French</hi>
King could not get that part of <hi>Holland</hi> which was drencht by
Freſh Water, to ſouſe it with Salt Water, by cutting down their
Sea-Banks; but <hi>Point Homo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Dutch Mob,</hi> aſtoniſhed and confounded with the Loſs
of their Country by Land, and oppoſed by Two the moſt Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

                     </p>
                     <p>The Prince being the King's Nephew, and having never offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<hi>French</hi> King, that the King would not ſuffer the Prince to fall into
a worſe State than the <hi>De Witts</hi> intended, by ſuffering the <hi>French</hi>
to conquer <hi>Holland,</hi> whereby the Prince's Authority muſt needs
be ſwallowed up. This the <hi>French</hi> King foreſaw, and therefore to
obviate it, the <hi>French</hi> King was the firſt who made Application to
the Prince, and propoſed to him the making him Soveraign of the

(ſuch a Protection was never heard of before) But the <hi>French</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>It's admirable to conſider, that notwithſtanding the Conqueſt
by the <hi>French</hi> of the other Provinces, and the Deſolation of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the long Prejudices, even from his Cradle, againſt him
by the <hi>Loveſtein</hi> Faction, this Generous Prince in his moſt florid
and ambitious Age, ſhould out of his vertuous, innate Love to
his Country, ſtand ſo firm to it, that his Anſwers were, <hi>That he
would never betray a Truſt repoſed in him, nor ſell the Liberties of his
Country, which his Anceſtors had ſo long defended, and God ſo bleſt him
herein.</hi> But out of theſe Ruins ſhall this limited Prince ariſe, and
put a check to the boundleſs and arbitrary Ambition of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
<hi>French</hi> Univerſal Monarch, as his Anceſtors before had to
the <hi>Spaniſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King it ſeems could not but ſee, that whilſt he got no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but blows by Sea, the <hi>French</hi> got all by Land; and therefore
ſent the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> my Lords <hi>Arlington</hi> and <hi>Hallifax,</hi> to
the <hi>French</hi> King, keeping his Court at <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> but with Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as ſecret and dark, as thoſe of making the War: Theſe when
they came into <hi>Holland,</hi> were informed of the <hi>French</hi> Deſigns;
and the King's Anſwer to their Deputies was, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the King
might treat as he pleaſed, but that what the</hi> French <hi>King had got,
was his own; and that what he ſhould get he would not reſtore without
an Equivalent.</hi> Which raiſed ſuch an Indignation in them that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would ſerve their turn but deſtroying, at leaſt maſtering
the <hi>French</hi> Fleet: And in this Humour they went to the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> and promiſed the ſame; and engaged to their utmoſt, to
bring the <hi>French</hi> King to be ſatisfied with <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> and of keeping
Gariſons in the Towns upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> belonging to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors

that the <hi>States</hi> muſt give Satisfaction to both Kings jointly, and that

know what the Kings joint and reſpective Demands were, and of
the new Agreement made by them, ſo contrary to their Promiſe

theſe Queries.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Whether they were ſent to promote the <hi>French Conqueſt?</hi>
If not, why, by making the Peace impoſſible, as far as in them lay,
would they force the <hi>Dutch</hi> to ſubmit to the <hi>French Dominion?</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. Whether they did not know that the <hi>French</hi> Demands alone
had been rejected by the <hi>States,</hi> and that the granting of them
would make it impoſſible for the <hi>Dutch</hi> to give the King any Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction?</item>
                        <item>3. Whether having received from the Prince and States all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
Aſſurances of their Deſigns to return to the King's Amity,
and to purchaſe it at any Rate they could, they could faithfully
neglect theſe, and enter into a new Engagement, ſo prejudicial to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. How far thoſe who were joined in Commiſſion, did concur in their
Judgment; and whether theſe Conſiderations with many others, were
not repreſented to them, and urged by ſome who deſired to ſerve the
King faithfully?</item>
                        <item>5. Whether or no it was for that Reaſon they oppoſed to fiercely my
Lord Viſcount <hi>Hallifax</hi>'s (whom came a Day or two after them) Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Acting jointly with them, tho in the ſame Commiſſion with them,
in as ample a Manner as themſelves?</item>
                        <item>6. Who were thoſe who (after my Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> could be kept out no
longer) went privately to the <hi>French</hi> Camp under Pretences, and had
Negotiations of their own on foot?</item>
                        <item>7. Whether they had order to call the <hi>French</hi> King King of <hi>France,</hi>
and to name him before their Maſter, as well in the <hi>French</hi> Demands,
as of his Majeſty's, in all their Agreements which they ſent to the Prince
of <hi>Orange?</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>8. Whether they had Inſtructions to ſtand in the Behalf of the
<hi>French</hi> upon the Publick Exerciſe of the Roman Catholick Religion
in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces, the Churches to be divided to the <hi>Roman
Prieſts</hi> to be maintained out of the Publick Revenue? And to bind
the King's Hands, ſo that the <hi>French</hi> King may be ſure of his Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
theſe Plenipotentiaries (Two of them) agreed with the <hi>French,</hi>
that the King ſhould not treat nor conclude a Peace with the <hi>Dutch</hi>
without them: But the <hi>French</hi> King ſhall find no more Security here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
than the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniard</hi> did in the King's joining in the
Triple League.</item>

For the Support of this holy Catholick Deſign, ſtood my Lord

                     <p>But whatever the Commons thought of the King's Diſpenſing
Power in <hi>England, Lauderdale</hi> (the fifth in the Cabal in <hi>England)</hi>
was of another Opinion in <hi>Scotland;</hi> for in the ſecond Parliament
<hi>c.</hi> 1. held by him, he gets an Act declaring, That by Virtue of the
King's Supremacy, the ordering the Government of the Church
does properly belong to his Majeſty and Succeſſors, as an inherent
Right of the Crown; and that he may enact and emit ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,

Diſſenters, not Popiſh Meetings, in the Exerciſe of their Worſhip,
upon Penalty of Fining, Impriſonment, Baniſhment, and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation,

                        <pb n="491" facs="tcp:60932:251"/>
The Execution of theſe Orders was not by legal Officers, but
by an Army of <hi>Highland Robbers,</hi> who quartered upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
ſo that it may be a Queſtion, whether the <hi>French</hi> King did
not take his Meaſures in his Dragoon-Reformation, by the ground-work
laid by <hi>Lauderdale.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But his Grace (which it ſeems did work irreſiſtibly) did not
ſtay here; for his <hi>Highland Army,</hi> which conſiſted of eight or
nine thouſand Men, not only lived upon Free Quarter, upon all
ſorts of the King's peaceable Subjects, but in moſt places levied
great Sums of Money, under the Notion of Dry Quarters: they
had only regard to the Duke's private Animoſities; for the moſt
part of the Places where they quartered and deſtroyed, had not
been guilty of Field-Conventicles. The King's Subjects were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
Rebels, and <hi>Captions</hi> iſſued out for ſeizing their Perſons,
for not entring into Bond, That neither they, nor any under them,
ſhall go to Field-Conventicles; and the Nobility and Gentry were
diſarmed, who had ever been faithful to the King, and aſſiſted in
ſuppreſſing Field-Conventicles. Indictments were delivered in by
the King's Advocate in the Evening, to be anſwered next Morning
upon Oath, otherwiſe they were to be reputed guilty. Theſe and
many more of this kind, in the Matters relating to <hi>Lauderdale</hi>'s
Adminiſtration of Affairs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> were repreſented to the
King, and that by his Command; and are in <hi>Lauderdale</hi>'s and his
Lady's Impeachment, which are all in Print. Notwithſtanding
all this, it was this <hi>Lauderdale</hi> who had procured an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to raiſe 20000 Foot, and 2000 Horſe, to march into <hi>England</hi>
to ſerve the King upon all Occaſions. And tho the Duke, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Fame of his Actions arriving in <hi>England,</hi> had by a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
forbid all Subjects to depart the Kingdom without Licence,
yet the Noiſe of his Actions flew every where in <hi>England,</hi> not leſs
than the Cenſures of the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> and <hi>High Commiſſion,</hi> in
<hi>Laud</hi>'s Regency, did in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and in due time the Duke ſhall
hear of them. Can any Man now believe, That the King, by his
Declaration of Indulgence, intended any Benefit to the Diſſenters
in <hi>England,</hi> whilſt <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> without doubt by his Order, was
acting theſe things in <hi>Scotland?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Houſe of Commons could not at firſt ſtep forget all the
Loyalty they before profeſt to the King, nor yet would they own
the <hi>Dutch</hi> War; and therefore they voted the King 1238750 <hi>l.</hi> to
ſupply the King's extraordinary Occaſions; but before they would
let this Bill ſlip through their Fingers, they tack'd a Bill to it, by
which no Papiſt ſhould have any publick Employment. This Bill
catch'd my Lord Treaſurer <hi>Clifford,</hi> the firſt in the Cabal, who was
forced to reſign his Treaſurer's Place, or renounce <hi>Popery,</hi> which he
would not do; his Penſioners not being againſt it, hoping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to get the Places which the Popiſh Party held; and even my

Lord Chancellor <hi>Aſhley,</hi> from <hi>Delenda Carthago,</hi> now ſets up for

are all Deſigns, which are not cemented in Juſtice and Honour.</p>
                     <p>The King having got the Bill for the Money, the further Sitting
of the Parliament became uneaſy to him; whereupon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was adjourned till the <hi>20th,</hi> and after to the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>October,
viz.</hi> 1673.</p>
                     <p>During this Receſs, there were three Sea-Fights between the
<hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> Admiral, in all which
the <hi>French</hi> ſtood aloof, looking on whilſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
battered one another; only Monſieur <hi>de Martell,</hi> for engaging,
was recalled, checked, and diſmiſſed.</p>
                     <p>As the <hi>Engliſh</hi> thrived no better by Sea, ſo neither did the
<hi>French</hi> by Land; for firſt the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> then the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,

of the Danger common to them all, of the <hi>French</hi> ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Provinces, entred into a mutual League for their
Defence: and by their Conjunction, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pland Towns,</hi> in almoſt as little Time as the
<hi>French</hi> had taken them.</p>
                     <p>In this ſtate the <hi>Swede</hi> now broke looſe from the Triple League,
whereby he opened the Gap to let in this Confuſion, and became a
Penſioner to <hi>France,</hi> and propoſes a Treaty of Peace to be held at
<hi>Cologn;</hi> and thither the King, the Emperor, the <hi>French</hi> King, and
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſend their Plenipotentiaries to treat of it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> King's Propoſitions were ſo inſolent, that if granted,
our King could have nothing; yet the King <hi>(pudet haec)</hi> inſiſted,
That tho he was contented with ſuch Propoſitions as he required,
ſo as accepted in ten Days, yet if granted by the <hi>States,</hi> they
ſhould be of no force: nor will he enter into any Treaty of Peace,
unleſs his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty ſhall receive Satisfaction from the
<hi>States</hi> in his Particular.</p>
                     <p>After the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould have all, the King's Demands were
a Regulation of the Trade to the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> a Settlement of the
Freedom of Navigation in <hi>Europe,</hi> the Arrears for the Fiſhing-Trade
upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſt, to aſſert a ſettled Revenue to the
Crown for every Buſs or Dogger-boat for the future; and to make
Satisfaction for the Damages ſuſtained by the Depredations upon
the Ships and Lading taken from Sir <hi>Paul Pindar,</hi> and Sir <hi>William
Courten,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In this Interval of the Parliament's Receſs, the King took the
Seals from my Lord Chancellour <hi>Aſhley;</hi> now made Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
and gave them to Sir <hi>Heneage Finch,</hi> a Perſon of ſingular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
Eloquence, and Veracity; who to thoſe inſite Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
which were natural to him, improved them, by the great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of his Uncle <hi>John Finch,</hi> likewiſe Keeper of the Great Seal
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:60932:252"/>
in the King's Father's Reign; yet with a different Fate, for the
Temper of the Times would not bear his Uncle's Integrity, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and Veracity; whenas the Nephew, with proſperous
Gales, continued his Courſe till he arrived at Lord Chancellour,
Lord <hi>Daventry,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and kept the Seals to his
dying Day; which not one of his three Predeceſſors could do: And
Sir <hi>Thomas Osburn</hi> ſucceeded Lord Treaſurer. So <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>A.</hi> are

                     </p>
                     <p>At laſt the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> came, and the Parliament met again,
when at the opening of the Seſſion, the new Lord Keeper, with
admired Eloquence and Veracity (which he retained to his dying
Day) made a large Deduction of the <hi>Dutch Averſeneſs</hi> to Peace;
their uncivil Demeanour to the King's Plenipotentiaries at <hi>Cologn,</hi>
and how indirectly they dealt with the King in all the Overtures
of Peace; and therefore a neceſſary Supply, proportionable to
the Greatneſs of the King's Affairs, was not only demanded, but
Care to be taken for Payment of the Bankers Debt, otherways
Multitudes of the King's Loyal Subjects would be undone.</p>
                     <p>But neither the Keeper's Eloquence nor his Veracity would
down with the Commons; for during this Receſs, the Terror of
the <hi>French</hi> Progreſs had alarm'd the Nation as well as the reſt of
<hi>Chriſtendom:</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Legerdemain at Sea was ſo much more
taken notice of as our Loſs was more, by their looking on whilſt
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> deſtroyed one another. The Commons
were frighted at the ſtanding Army in <hi>England,</hi> commanded by
a Foreigner, and an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſt, taking all Military Liberty as in
Time of War. It was more than whiſper'd, the Conditions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by the King's Plenipotentiaries at <hi>Cologn</hi> were impoſſible;
which tho granted, yet no Peace was to be had, unleſs the <hi>French</hi>
King was anſwer'd in his Demands: nor were the Commons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with their Prorogation, till the Marriage with the Princeſs
of <hi>Modena</hi> was paſt Cure.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon the <hi>Commons,</hi> on the <hi>31st</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by a Vote, That conſidering the preſent Condition of the
Nation, they will not take into further Conſideration any Aids
or Charges upon the Subject, except it ſhall appear that the Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhall render it neceſſary; nor before this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
be effectually ſecured from Popery and Popiſh Counſels, and
other Grievances redreſſed.</p>
                     <p>This early Vote of the Commons was ſo much more ſurprizing
to the Band of Penſioners, who as yet had not earned their Bread,
by how much they expected Mountains of Gold ſhould fall from
my Lord Keeper's Eloquence and Veracity. And now is the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
like his Father when he went to <hi>York</hi> to fight the <hi>Scots,</hi> reduced
to a fine ſtate, all the Monies received from the <hi>French</hi> King, like
Water ſpilt upon the Ground, never to be collected: Beſides the

Band of Penſioners, he had a Land Army to maintain, and a
Fleet at Sea, which the <hi>French</hi> Subſidies would not one fourth
maintain: He could not avoid the Clamours of his Subjects whoſe
Monies were ſhut up in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> nor the Merchants who had
ſupplied his Navy in this and the former <hi>Dutch</hi> War; yet their
Graces the Dutcheſſes of <hi>Cleveland</hi> and <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> muſt be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

Portions to be provided for many of his Off-ſpring of the other
Sex. He had already provided Titles for the Cabal, except <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi>
who could not be greater. However, you'll ſee this Vote
of the Commons will work powerfully, notwithſtanding the
Agreement at <hi>

                     </p>

Employment: and upon the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> moved,

                     </p>
                     <p>The Rump of the Cabal thus uſed, frighted the whole Band of
Penſioners into a Fear, their Turn would be next, at leaſt their
Penſions not paid; and therefore to undo all that was done, in a

not having ſat eight Days.</p>
                     <p>But the Commons needed not to have been ſo fierce upon <hi>B.
A.</hi> and <hi>L.</hi> for <hi>B.</hi> was now going off, and <hi>A.</hi> being the King's
Brother-in-law was ſpited that he was twice balked in being Lord
Treaſurer; and if he did not turn to t'other ſide, yet he would
never be reconciled with my Lord Treaſurer: Only <hi>L.</hi> now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
to be quit with the Commons, to get an Act of Parliament
in <hi>Scotland</hi> to raiſe 20000 Foot and 2000 Horſe, to ſerve the
King upon all Occaſions.</p>
                     <p>The King having ſo haſtily begun this War, by two ſuch Acts
as were without Precedent, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſhutting up the <hi>Exchequer,</hi>
and the Attempt upon the <hi>Dutch Smyrna</hi> Fleet, was now as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to make a Peace with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> even upon any Terms; tho
but laſt Year his Plenipotentiaries had agreed at <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> with the
<hi>French</hi> King, not to make Peace with the <hi>Dutch</hi> without him;
and this Year at <hi>Cologn,</hi> to grant no Peace unleſs the <hi>French</hi> King
be ſatisfied in his Particulars.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="495" facs="tcp:60932:253"/>
By this time the <hi>CABAL</hi> was degenerated into a <hi>Juncto,</hi> and
this was compounded too of five, <hi>viz.</hi> My Lord Keeper <hi>F—
L—Lauderdale, Arlington,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Coventry,</hi> in room of
Secretary <hi>Trevor,</hi> now dead.</p>
                     <p>It was agreed by the whole <hi>Juncto,</hi> That Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> was
the moſt proper Agent for making this Peace, not only for his
Abilities and great Reputation he had acquired in concluding the
<hi>Triple League,</hi> but for the Honour and Eſteem the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
and <hi>States of Holland</hi> held of his Integrity and Conduct: And in
order hereunto, my Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> from the King and <hi>Juncto,</hi>
complimented Sir <hi>William,</hi> and told him, He would not pretend
the Merit of having named him (Sir <hi>William)</hi> upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
or whether the King or my Lord Treaſurer did it firſt, but
that the whole Committee joined in it, and concluded, That ſince
a Peace was to be made, no other Perſon to be thought ſo fit for
it; and therefore the King, with many kind Expreſſions, gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to Sir <hi>William</hi> to prepare for his Journey, and the Secretary
to draw up his Inſtructions.</p>
                     <p>But how forward ſoever the <hi>Juncto</hi> were for Peace, the <hi>Dutch</hi>
out-run them, or at leaſt kept equal Pace with them: for tho
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> were victorious in <hi>Holland,</hi> and with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Prudence and Conduct, like another <hi>Scipio,</hi> carried the War
out of his Country, and thereby ſaved it; for in the dead of the
Year he joined <hi>Montecuculi</hi> the Emperor's General, and beſieged
and took <hi>Bon</hi> (the Reſidence of the Elector of <hi>Cologn)</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
cut off the Communication between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the <hi>French</hi> were forced not only to quit their conquer'd Towns
by heaps, but he opened a Paſſage for the Imperial Forces to join
the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh;</hi> yet the <hi>Dutch,</hi> having but newly recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their drowned Country, and loſt their Trade, the Charges of
maintaining their Land Army became ſo great, that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
this Year to ſet out a Fleet by Sea.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Dutch States</hi> therefore gave the Marqueſs of <hi>Frezno</hi> (the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador in <hi>England)</hi> Power to treat and conclude a
Peace with the King, which came in three Days after the <hi>Juncto</hi>
had ſent to Sir <hi>William:</hi> and this, by Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Advice, ſtayed
his Journey into <hi>Holland,</hi> it being more honourable for the King
to be ſought to, than ſeek a Peace; and that the King's Intereſt
might be better purſued at <hi>London</hi> than at the <hi>Hague.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King and <hi>Juncto</hi> agreed to it, and withal added, <hi>That tho
Sir</hi> William <hi>did not treat the Peace at the</hi> Hague, <hi>he ſhould at</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:
And when Sir <hi>William</hi> had received his Inſtructions, he at
three Meetings with the Marqueſs concluded the whole Treaty
with the Satisfaction of the King.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> ſays, the Articles being publick, need no Place
here; but the two Points of greateſt Difficulty were the Flag,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:60932:254"/>
and recalling the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Troops out of the <hi>French</hi> Service: But
that this laſt was compoſed by private Engagements to ſuffer thoſe
to wear out without any Recruits, or not to permit new ones to
go over; yet at the ſame time to give Leave to the <hi>Dutch</hi> to
raiſe ſuch Levies as they ſhould think fit in his Majeſty's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
                     <p>But this is an odd Equivocation to recal the <hi>French</hi> Troops,
which was to let them wear out, without Recruits, which was
not obſerved neither, for Men were not only encouraged, but
preſſed to this Service: and to theſe in the <hi>French</hi> Service does
Sir <hi>William</hi> and the <hi>Germans</hi> too aſcribe the Glory of all the
<hi>French</hi> Actions, who not only in <hi>Turenne</hi>'s Life, but at his Death,
ſaved the whole <hi>French</hi> Army. But if this be as Sir <hi>William</hi> ſays,
yet the King hereby, inſtead of being the Protector, becomes a
Murderer of his Subjects, in permitting them to kill one another
on both ſides; for it is impoſſible the War ſhould be juſt on both
ſides: Nor do I believe the like Precedent can be ſhewed, unleſs
by the King's Grandfather <hi>James</hi> I.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs, I have not ſeen the Articles of the Treaty at large;
but by ſo much as I have ſeen, I do not find that the Arrears for
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fiſhing upon the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> agreed
upon in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's Time (which was 30000 <hi>l. per
Annum)</hi> and a ſettled Revenue for that Fiſhery for the Time to
come, inſiſted upon at the Treaty of <hi>Cologn;</hi> nor the Damages
to the Executors of Sir <hi>Paul Pindar</hi> and Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> were
ſo much as mention'd in it. It may be the 800000 <hi>Patacoons</hi> to
be paid by the <hi>Dutch</hi> to the King by this Treaty, were intended in
Satisfaction of the Executors Demands, of which they denied they
ever received one Penny.</p>
                     <p>This haſty Peace thus huddled up, in leſs than 4 Days, <hi>viz.</hi>
between the <hi>5th</hi> or <hi>6th</hi> and <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> would not admit of
the Eſtabliſhment of a Marine Treaty, and Regulation of the <hi>East-India</hi>
Trade between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> and Treaty at <hi>Cologn:</hi>
And therefore it was agreed, That Commiſſioners on both ſides
were to meet at <hi>London</hi> to treat of theſe, and determine them in
three Months after ſuch Meeting: and in caſe any Differences
ſhould not be adjuſted, theſe to be referred to the Queen Regent
of <hi>Spain,</hi> who ſhould name 11 Commiſſioners, the greater part of
whom ſhould determine the Differences in 6 Months after, and
theſe to meet in 3 Months after the Queen Regent ſhall have taken
the foreſaid Arbitriment upon her ſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the</hi> States, <hi>as wiſe in this Treaty as the</hi> Engliſh <hi>were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident
and haſty, got the</hi> 7th <hi>Article agreed to,</hi> viz. That the
Treaty made at <hi>Breda</hi> 1667, as alſo other Treaties renewed by it, be
confirmed, and remain in full Force and Vigour, as far as they ſhall
not be contrary to this preſent Treaty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="497" facs="tcp:60932:254"/>
The <hi>Marine Treaty</hi> was agreed by the Commiſſioners; but the
firſt and fifth Articles ill obſerved by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as I have ſeen made
publick; but nothing was agreed for the Regulation of the <hi>East-India</hi>
Trade, nor any thing concerning it referred to the Queen
Regent of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is that honourable Peace, to his Majeſty's Satisfaction,
which ſucceeded this glorious War, to the Expence of ſuch vaſt
Treaſure and Charge to <hi>England,</hi> and involving <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> into
a War, wherein we taught the <hi>French</hi> to fight by Sea, while they
encouraged the <hi>Dutch</hi> and us to deſtroy one another, whereby we
got nothing but dry Blows, except the 800000 Patacoons: for the
Flag was ever given by the <hi>Dutch</hi> to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi>
and King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and by the Treaty to <hi>Oliver</hi> in 1654, and to
the King in 1666 and 1667, nor ever deſired by the <hi>States:</hi>
But the <hi>Dutch</hi> got confirmed the Iſlands of <hi>Amboyna</hi> and <hi>Polloroon,</hi>
which they had raviſhed from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> (whereby they not only
ſupply <hi>Europe,</hi> but <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> with Spice) and <hi>Surinam;</hi>
and alſo got diſcharged again from the Piracy or Robbery perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
upon the <hi>Bona Eſperanza</hi> and <hi>Henry Bonadventura</hi> in Time
of Peace, and all the Arrears of 30000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> for fiſhing
upon our Coaſts ſince 1636. So little Regard was had, in this
Treaty, either of the King's Honour, or of the Good or Intereſt
of the Nation.</p>
                     <p>However, 'twas the Intereſt of <hi>Spain</hi> to promote this ſeparate
Peace with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> for this Year the <hi>French</hi> King having brib'd
the <hi>Swiſs</hi> to a Compliance, took the <hi>Franche County</hi> from <hi>Spain,</hi>
the <hi>Swiſs</hi> keeping Gariſons in <hi>Dole</hi> and <hi>Beſanzon:</hi> And this Year

                  <p>TO mollify his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, highly exaſperated, you
muſt think, by this Peace, the King, 'twas ſaid, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, ſent his Ship-Carpenters to inſtruct the <hi>French</hi> how to
build his Men of War: and I ſay, Sir <hi>Anthony Dean</hi> told me, that
by Order of the King, he built the Model of a Man of War (as I
remember he ſaid of a hundred and fifty Tuns) and carried it
by Water to <hi>Roan,</hi> from whence the <hi>French</hi> King convey'd it by
hand to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> and had it launched into his great Pool he had
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:60932:255"/>
made there, where he came on board, and had much Conference
with Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> upon it.</p>
                  <p>And if the Service of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> commanded by <hi>Turenne</hi> in <hi>France</hi>
were not ſufficient for carrying on the War againſt the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
the King emptied his own <hi>Magazines</hi> to fill the <hi>French;</hi>
and that from <hi>June</hi> 1675 to <hi>June</hi> 1677, Granadoes were ſent
without Number, under colour of unwrought Iron; Lead-ſhot
twenty one Tuns, Gun-powder ſeven thouſand one hundred
and thirty four Barrels, Iron-ſhot eighteen Tuns ſix hundred
Weight, Match eighty eight Tuns and a thouſand Weight;
Iron Ordnance four hundred forty one, Quantity two hundred
ninety two Tuns, nine hundred Weight; Carriages, Bandaliers,
Pikes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> uncertain.</p>
                  <p>In return of theſe Kindneſſes, the <hi>French</hi> King not only exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly
enlarged his Impoſitions upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in their Trade to
<hi>France,</hi> but let looſe his Privateers upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as if there
had been no Peace, and plunder'd, murder'd, made Prize of their
Ships and Effects, and confiſcated them; block'd up our Coaſt,
and took our Ships out of their very Ports: and if Complaints
were made at his Soveraign Port, they were baffled, except
ſome which were redeemed by Sir <hi>Ellis Leighton</hi>'s Intereſt (a
moſt notorious—) who made a ſecond Prize of them.
Mr. <hi>Marvel,</hi> at the End of his <hi>Growth of Popery,</hi> gives an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of ſixty three of theſe, with the Maſters Names, their
Burden, Lading, and the Ports they belonged to, from 1674 to
the latter end of 1676.</p>
                  <p>Now the King, who by this War had ſet <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> in a Flame,
being himſelf got out of it, ſets up to be a Mediator for Peace; and
no Man ſo fit to be employed in it as Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obſerved how the Miniſters had deceived him or themſelves,
and adviſed the King to break Treaties ſo ſolemnly agreed upon,
would not take this Employment upon him before he had ſounded
the King's true Sentiment, and truſt no more to his Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> therefore, in a Conference with the King in his
Cloſet, and in a well compoſed Speech, reflected upon the <hi>Cabal,</hi>
how ill he had been adviſed to break Treaties ſo ſolemnly agreed
to, and how ill they had ſucceeded, how different the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>France</hi> were from thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> and how different the
State of the Crown now was from that when it had the Court of
Wards, and Knights Service, and large Revenues of Lands, and
Fee-Farms which now were alienated: ſo that <hi>Gourville</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that a King of <hi>England</hi> who will be the Man of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
is the greateſt King in the World; but if he will be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more, he is nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>The King heard Sir <hi>William</hi> attentively, yet impatiently at firſt,
but at laſt the King ſaid, <hi>Gourville</hi> had reaſon for what was ſaid, and
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:60932:255"/>
ſaid, <hi>And I will be the Man of my People:</hi> but you'll ſee the King
ſhall not long hold in this Mind; for Monſieur <hi>Barillon,</hi> the <hi>French</hi>
Ambaſſador, and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> by the Agency of a
<hi>French</hi> Monk, who had changed his Frock for a Petticoat, ſhall
unravel all Sir <hi>William</hi> had been weaving in the Treaty of <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Embaſſy was declared in <hi>May</hi> 1674, and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches
finiſhed in <hi>July</hi> following, when he went into <hi>Holland:</hi> But
it ſeems to me the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt was chiefly deſigned, even in
this Embaſſy; for tho Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Inſtructions were for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Peace, yet his Application was firſt to the States, and after to
the Prince, that they would accept of it, and after their Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of it, to endeavour it with their Allies; which looks as if
the King rather intended a ſeparate Peace with the <hi>Dutch</hi> and
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> than a general one: and this the King endeavoured during
the whole Treaty at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> as you may ſee at large in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Part of Sir <hi>William Temple</hi>'s ſecond Memoirs, and ſo ended
at laſt; and ſo the States underſtood it, who tho at firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of a ſeparate Peace, yet in Honour they could not leave
out the Confederates who had ſaved their Country: And if the
<hi>French</hi> King could have a ſeparate Peace with the <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi>
he little cared for the Empire, being in a Treaty with Count <hi>Teckely</hi>
to raiſe a Rebellion in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and to engage the <hi>Turk</hi> in a War
againſt the Empire.</p>
                  <p>Tho the King had got out of this War, yet this Summer the
<hi>French</hi> King got the <hi>Swede</hi> into it (and as juſtly as the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
this War by his Attempt upon the <hi>Dutch Smirna</hi>-Fleet, for
the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> had withdrawn a great Army out of
his Country, to aſſiſt the Confederates upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> againſt
Monſieur <hi>Turenne,</hi> who commanded the <hi>French)</hi> without declaring
War, the <hi>Swede</hi> made War againſt him in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> tho it had
like to have coſt the <hi>Swede</hi> all he had in <hi>Pomerania;</hi> for the Elector
returning at the latter end of the Summer, routed the <hi>Swediſh</hi>
Army, and after took <hi>Stetin</hi> (the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Pomerland)</hi> and
had kept it, if afterwards the <hi>Dutch</hi> had not made a ſeparate
Peace, and left him and the Empire too, who had ſaved them, to
the Mercy of the <hi>French:</hi> And this had been done a Year ſooner
if the Noble Conſtancy and Authority of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had
not oppoſed it, who this Year fought the great Battel at <hi>Seneff</hi>
againſt the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> with uncertain Victory.</p>
                  <p>You have ſeen how we got Peace abroad, now let's ſee how
things ſtood at home. Tho the Popiſh Party had been twice
balk'd in their Deſigns, I mean by the King's recalling the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and this Peace, yet were their Hopes and Deſigns by the
Marriage of the Duke with the Princeſs of <hi>Modena</hi> more heightned
than ever; for they knew the King being involved in all ſenſual
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:60932:256"/>
Pleaſures, and therefore hating the Cares and Troubles of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
might eaſily be prevailed upon by Importunity; and the
Dutcheſs being an adopted Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> and having her
Advancement and Portion from the <hi>French</hi> King, was obliged to
propagate the <hi>French</hi> Deſigns with the Duke, and he with the
King: And the Advancement of the Catholick Cauſe was the moſt

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us and glorious Work they could promote, and therefore <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
(the Duke's Secretary) now holds Intelligence with Father
<hi>Ferrier</hi> (the <hi>French</hi> King's Confeſſor) <hi>Ferrier</hi> with the Jeſuited
Faction in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Coleman</hi> with thoſe in <hi>England</hi> how to
manage the King in order to it.</p>
                  <p>The Bargain was ſoon made by <hi>Coleman</hi> and <hi>Ferrier,</hi> and his
Chriſtian Majeſty was fully ſatisfied of the Duke's good Intentions
towards him, ſo that he eſteemed both their Intereſts to be one
and the ſame: This Return was by Sir <hi>William Throgmorton,</hi> June 2.
<hi>S. N.</hi> 1674, to <hi>Coleman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Coleman</hi> communicates to the Duke, who commanded
<hi>Coleman</hi> to anſwer, That the Duke was very ſenſible of his moſt
Chriſtian Majeſty's Friendſhip, which he would cultivate with all
the good Offices he was capable of, and that the Duke was fully
convinced that their Intereſts were one, and the Parliament was
not only unuſeful, but dangerous both to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> and
that it was the Duke's Opinion, That if his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
would write his Thoughts freely to the King upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and make the ſame Offer of his Purſe to diſſolve this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as he made to the Duke to call another, he did believe it
very poſſible for him to ſucceed; and from this time to the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the Popiſh Plot, you ſhall ſee the Parliament call'd,
prorogu'd and adjourn'd, by Order from <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

                  <p>That this Deſign may be carried on in Maſquerade, the whole
Band of Penſioners make it their Buſineſs to poſſeſs whom they
could perſwade, that the Church is in danger, (truly ſaid, but
untruly intended) and that the Nation was running into <hi>Forty
One:</hi> All Countenance and Hopes of Preferment were promiſed to
thoſe who would ſupport the Church from the Danger of <hi>Forty
One.</hi> This was blaz'd abroad, and encouraged by all ſorts of
printed Pamphlets, and if they met with Oppoſition, the Authors
and Printers were perſecuted for publiſhing unlicenſed Pamphlets:
Mr. <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange</hi> was the Champion and Penſioner of the

                  <p>The Houſe of Commons had been ſullen theſe two laſt Seſſions,
and proceeded contrary to the Humour and Deſign of the Court,
and therefore a Bill was brought into the Houſe of Lords, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>An Act to prevent the Danger that may ariſe from Perſons diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
to the Government,</hi> which was the ſame impoſed upon the
diſſenting Clergy by the <hi>Oxford five-Mile-Act:</hi> this my Lord-keeper
ſaid was a moderate Security to the Church and Crown,
which no honeſt Man could refuſe, and who did, gave great ſuſpicion
of dangerous and Antimonarchical Principles: This Oath or Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence
or Teſt is mentioned before, and is now ſet on foot to be
taken by all who enjoy'd any Beneficial Offices, Eccleſiaſtical, Civil
or Military, to which were added Privy-Counſellors, Juſtices of
the Peace, and Parliament-Men.</p>
                  <p>It's ſtrange to me that Princes, or indeed other Men, who have
any Piety or Fear of God, ſhould think to be ſecure in unjuſt
Actions, by Mens ſwearing to obſerve them: For tho Human Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be voluntary, yet the End and Deſign by them is not in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Power: <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apollos</hi> water, but only God can
give the Bleſſing; with what reaſon then can Man expect a Bleſſing
from God, becauſe his Name is profaned, and made as a ſtalking-Horſe
to attain it? What Security had the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> by their
Covenant, or the <hi>Rump</hi> Parliament by their Engagement, or <hi>Oliver</hi>
or his Son by their Recognition? And more I think the King could
not expect hereby.</p>
                  <p>Whereas Princes whoſe Thrones are eſtabliſh'd by Juſtice and
Righteouſneſs, have a nobler Security than can be hoped for by
Mens previous ſwearing to get Offices and Employments; ſo that
<hi>Trajan,</hi> who was truly called the <hi>Juſt,</hi> put his Sword into the
<hi>Praetorian Prefect</hi>'s Hands, and bid him draw it againſt him, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he ſhould attempt any thing againſt the Publick Good.</p>

This King had a way, never gone by any of his Predeceſſors, to
be preſent in the Houſe of Lords at Debates, and would ſolicit
Lords for their Votes: This was firſt declaimed againſt by my Lord
<hi>Lucas,</hi> as an Awe upon the Peers in their Debates and Votes.
This Oath being the Gap to let in the Popiſh Deſigns, you cannot
think the King would now be away, but give all Countenance to
the paſſing of it; the Biſhops to a Man were for paſſing of it, ſo
were all the Court-Lords, or thoſe who hoped for Preferment, ſo
as theſe were the much greater Part: Yet the Country Lords when
they debated it in Paragraphs, made it inconſiſtent with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Conſtitution of the Nation, vain and ſuperfluous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
in it ſelf, which held for ſeventeen days together: But
the Debates were laid aſide by the Commons Votes againſt the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
of the Lords in Appeals from <hi>Chancery.</hi> Theſe Debates
you may read at large in Print in a Tract intituled, <hi>A Letter from
a Perſon of Quality to his Friend in the Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe my Lord-keeper <hi>will have an ill-meant Diſtinction
between the King's Natural and Politick Capacity,</hi> I'll put one Caſe
which I do not find in all theſe Debates: The one Part of the
Oath is, I declare, <hi>That it is not lawful upon any Pretence whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
to take up Arms againſt the King; and, that I do abhor that
Traiterous Poſition of taking Arms by his Authority againſt his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or againſt thoſe who are commiſſionated by him, in purſuance of
ſuch Commiſſion.</hi> Suppoſe Duke <hi>Lauderdale</hi> ſhould have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
from the King to bring his twenty two thouſand <hi>Scots</hi> into
<hi>England</hi> (and you cannot believe the <hi>Scots</hi> Law to do it was made
to no purpoſe) and plunder, and diſpoſſeſs the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of their
Eſtates; and the Sheriffs of the Counties ſhould raiſe the <hi>Poſſe</hi> to
ſuppreſs them, and compel them to keep the Peace, as the Sheriff
by his Commiſſion and Oath is bound to do: On which ſide does
the Abhorrence of the Traiterous Poſition of taking up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe commiſſionated by the King lie? But you'll ſay this
cannot be imagined; and I ſay, the Deſign of impoſing this Oath,
makes this not only imaginable, but believed to be intended.</p>
                  <p>In the Debates the Commons raiſe a Storm againſt the Lords
Juriſdiction in Appeals from <hi>Chancery,</hi> upon which the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued
the Parliament to the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1675.</p>
                  <p>Tho the Duke loſt Ground in the Houſe of Commons, and was
diſappointed in carrying the <hi>abhorring Teſt</hi> in the Houſe of Lords,
yet he gained ſo much upon the <hi>French</hi> King, that upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of <hi>June</hi> he offered the Duke his Friendſhip, the uſe of his
Purſe to the aſſiſting of him againſt the Deſigns of his and the
Duke's Enemies; and proteſted their Intereſts were ſo cloſe linked
together, that thoſe who oppoſed the one, ſhould be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as Enemies to the other, with much more, as you may read in
the Duke's Letter to <hi>Le Chaiſe,</hi> the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1675.</p>

Tho the <hi>French</hi> could not fight againſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> in Conjunction
with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> yet without the <hi>Engliſh</hi> they can fight the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi>
and <hi>Dutch:</hi> For the <hi>Spaniard</hi> (having block'd up <hi>Meſſina</hi> in
<hi>Sicily</hi> by Land, which laſt Year revolted to the <hi>French)</hi> agreed
with the <hi>Dutch</hi> to ſend a Fleet of Men of War to join the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi>
to block up <hi>Meſſina</hi> by Sea, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> this Year did under
<hi>De Ruyter;</hi> but were ſo niggardly in it, that the <hi>French</hi> beat both
<hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleets, and killed <hi>De Ruyter:</hi> This was a juſt
Reward returned to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> for building the <hi>French</hi> ſix great
Men of War ſix or ſeven Years before. Juſt ſo <hi>Richlieu</hi> ſerved
the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in 1637, for joining with the <hi>French,</hi> in expelling
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of the Iſle of <hi>Rhee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho the King were the firſt in the Triple League for the Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty
of the Treaty of <hi>Aix,</hi> for the Preſervation of <hi>Flanders;</hi>
and tho the King in his Declaration at the beginning of this War,
had engaged to ſupport the Peace made at <hi>Aix;</hi> yet the <hi>French</hi>
King this Summer took the City of <hi>Limburg,</hi> being the chief of
one of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Provinces: which the King not only takes no
notice of, but tells Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> (newly commanded out of
<hi>Holland</hi> by the King) that ſome warm Leaders in both Houſes
had a mind to engage him in a War againſt <hi>France,</hi> which they
ſhould not do, becauſe he was ſure they would make uſe of it to
the Ruin of his Miniſters. If the King were unhappy in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
he was not leſs in ſaying this to Sir <hi>William,</hi> to whom
the Year before he promiſed to be the Man of his People, but is
now of his Miniſters: And ſure he was the firſt Prince that ever
profeſt it.</p>
                  <p>Upon the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> the Houſes met, and the King asked a
Supply for building of Ships, and to take off the Anticipation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Revenue.</p>
                  <p>In the Interval of this Receſs, the Debates of the Abhorring
Oath became publick, which ſo nettled the Court and Church-Party,
being the more numerous, that ſince they could not prevail
by Reaſon, they would by Fire, and therefore ordered them to be
burnt, which made the Debates ſo much more to be enquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and hereby received a greater Light.</p>
                  <p>The Commons had before them ſeveral Bills for preventing fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Miſchief, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>

                  </q>
                  <p>Theſe Bills being ſo diametrically contrary to the <hi>French</hi> and
Popiſh Deſigns, and the Commons now more peremptorily than
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:60932:258"/>
before, oppoſing the Lords Juriſdiction in Appeals from <hi>Chancery,</hi>
ſo that they voted, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſolicite or proſecute any Appeal
againſt any Commoner of</hi> England <hi>from any Court of Equity before the</hi>
Houſe <hi>of</hi> Lords, <hi>ſhall be deemed and taken a Betrayer of the Rights
and Liberties of the</hi> Commons <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>and ſhall be proceeded
againſt accordingly:</hi> And the Commons having commanded the
Counſel (who pleaded before the Lords) to the <hi>Tower,</hi> (How
much is the caſe now altered?) the King took thereby an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to prorogue the Parliament from the <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 1675,
to the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 1676, which is above a Year; in which
time, by a Law in <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's time, a Parliament was to be
called; and as it was without Precedent, ſo it cauſed new Debates
and Heats in both Houſes when they met.</p>
                  <p>In this long Receſs, I find but few Motions of the <hi>French</hi> and
Popiſh Councils more than what appeared in Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoin</hi>'s
and other Trials: For <hi>Coleman</hi>'s laſt two Years Letters were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt,
as was his Book of Entries; and the Commotions raiſed in
<hi>Britany</hi> and <hi>Guiene,</hi> by the Impoſitions impoſed upon the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
hindred the <hi>French</hi> this Year from their uſually more early
opening their Campagn than the Confederates; ſo that every
where the Confederates prevailed againſt the <hi>French; Tureen</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was diſtreſſed by <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> and himſelf killed, yet the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
got on the <hi>French</hi> ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> by the Bravery and bold
Stands of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The Dukes of <hi>Lunenburg</hi> routed Marſhal
<hi>Crequy</hi>'s Army, and after took <hi>Triers,</hi> and made <hi>Crequy</hi> Priſoner;
and the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> alſo took <hi>Philipsburg;</hi> the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>
routed the <hi>Swedes</hi> in <hi>Pomerland,</hi> entred into a League with
the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who took <hi>Wiſmar</hi> from the <hi>Swede:</hi> and the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> took <hi>Binch</hi> from the <hi>French,</hi> and raſed it. But
the Progreſs of all theſe Victories were ſtopt, by the unaccountable
Retreat of <hi>Montecuculi</hi> out of <hi>Alſatia</hi> with his whole Army back
over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> it was ſaid by expreſs Orders from <hi>Vienna,</hi> thereby
leaving <hi>Alſatia</hi> in the Power of the <hi>French,</hi> to the breaking of the
old Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi>'s Heart; who at that time had, and never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſo fair a Proſpect of the Recovery of his Country.</p>
                  <p>If the Commotions in <hi>Britany</hi> and <hi>Guiene</hi> retarded the <hi>French</hi>
opening the Campagn laſt Year, the King ſhall make amends in
this: For having provided Stores for Horſe and Man in his Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
Gariſons, in <hi>February 167 6/7</hi> he block'd up <hi>Valenciennes</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi>
and committed ſuch Ravages, by burning and deſtroying
thoſe Parts of <hi>Germany</hi> which lay oppoſite to him on the other
ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> as if he made War not to conquer, but
to deſtroy, tho this were at a time whilſt they were in a Treaty of
Peace with the Empire and King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> he, notwithſtanding the extream
Coldneſs of the Seaſon, took <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> and from thence marched
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:60932:258"/>
to <hi>Cambray,</hi> and laid Siege to it and St. <hi>Omers;</hi> and after the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Trenches <hi>Cambray</hi> ſurrendred, but not the Citadel, our
King looking on, as if he had not been concerned in the Guaranty
of the Treaty of <hi>Aix:</hi> Nor could the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> prevent
this, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gariſons being ill provided, and the Confederates
being ſo ſlow in getting into Bodies to oppoſe the <hi>French;</hi> or if
they had been to be got together, they could not have kept the
Field for want of Proviſions for Horſe and Man.</p>
                  <p>However, tho the Prince could not come time enough to relieve
<hi>Cambray</hi> and <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> yet with the ſingle Forces of the <hi>States,</hi>
the <hi>Spaniard</hi> not ſo much as ſupplying him with Guides, marched
to the Relief of St. <hi>Omers;</hi> but the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> joining
with the Duke of <hi>Oleance,</hi> met the Prince at <hi>Mount-Caſſel,</hi> where
at firſt the Diſpute was brave, but the firſt Regiment of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Infantry breaking and falling into Diſorder, the Prince rallied them
ſeveral times, and renewed the Charge, but could not prevent
their plain Flight; yet made ſo brave a Retreat, which wanted lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of the Honour of a Victory; ſo both the Citadel of <hi>Cambray</hi>
and St. <hi>Omers,</hi> upon the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> fell into the <hi>French</hi> Hands,
and thereby the main Strength of the Frontier to the <hi>Dutch Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands</hi>
loſt: And by theſe Conqueſts the <hi>French</hi> King not only
delivered his own Subjects from the Contributions they paid to
theſe Cities, but enlarged his upon the Reſidue of the <hi>Spaniſh
Netherlands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>February 167 6/7,</hi> the Parliament met again,
and from the Variance between the Houſes about Appeals from
<hi>Chancery</hi> to the Lords, they fell at Variance in both Houſes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this long Prorogation were not a Diſſolution: The Conteſt
was higheſt in the Houſe of Lords, and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi>
the Earls of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> where
committed cloſe Priſoners to the Tower for their Reaſon alledged;
yet the Lords who voted their Commitment this Seſſion, were as
zealous the laſt to petition the King to diſſolve the Parliament, when
the Commons conteſted their Juriſdiction in Appeals from <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery:</hi>
But tho the Commons being in love with their ſitting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
the Parliament not to be diſſolved, yet they committed
none of their Members for debating whether the Parliament were
not; and granted the King an Additional Duty upon Beer, Ale and
other Liquors for three Years; for <hi>now was the time to ſecure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Property,</hi> ſaid my Lord Chancellor.</p>
                  <p>But whether the Parliament were diſſolved or not, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
were mightily alarm'd at the <hi>French</hi> Progreſs in <hi>Flanders,</hi>
and therefore upon the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>May</hi> reſolved, that an Addreſs be
made to the King to enter into a League Offenſive and Defenſive
with the States General of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> and make ſuch

Power of the <hi>French</hi> King, and for the Preſervation of the <hi>Spaniſh
Netherlands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems the Miniſters were as fearful of a War, as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

of the <hi>French:</hi> And ſure Princes have not ſuch a Prerogative, a
not to take Advice or Counſel, in leſs Actions than of War and
Peace.</p>
                  <p>If you look upon the King's former Actions, what Glorious
Wars, and Honourable Peaces he had made, you had little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to think it ſo dangerous to his Prerogative, to adviſe him:
For my part, I wonder the Commons ſhould make any Addreſs
to him about them, ſince they could have no Security in any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
he ſhould make to their Addreſs.</p>
                  <p>For was not the King a Guaranty in the Treaty of <hi>Aix,</hi> for the
Preſervation of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> before the <hi>Swede</hi> entred
into the Triple Alliance? And did not the King in the Beginning
of this War declare he would obſerve the Treaty of <hi>Aix,</hi> which
he might do, tho the <hi>Swede</hi> were out of it? And was not the
King by the laſt Peace with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> obliged to withdraw his
Subjects out of the <hi>French</hi> Service; yet did not only continue
them, but permitted, nay preſſed his Subjects to recruit and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
them?</p>
                  <p>In the firſt <hi>Dutch</hi> War, (which was deſigned for the Overthro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt) then the Commons Advice was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
and thankfully entertained; but in this, for the reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the boundleſs Ambition of the <hi>French</hi> King, is an unheard of
Uſurpation of the King's Prerogative.</p>
                  <p>However, by this the Commons might perceive what Thanks
they had from this King for their Reſtoration of him; and for the
manifold Millions they had poured upon him for the maintenance
of his Prodigality and Luxury; and how much he preferred the
Enjoyment of his Minions and Flatterers, above his own Honour,
the Safety and Welfare of himſelf, the Nation or Chriſtendom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="507" facs="tcp:60932:259"/>
The King to ſhew his further Indignation to the Commons,
and to take <hi>French</hi> Counſels for Reparation of their dangerous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion
of his Prerogative, ſignified to the Commons that they
ſhould adjourn till the ſixteenth of <hi>July</hi> following; which was
ſo abſolutely obeyed by the <hi>Speaker,</hi> then Mr. but now Sir <hi>E. S.</hi>
that without the Conſent of the Houſe, or ſo much as putting the
Queſtion, he adjourned them to the ſixteenth of <hi>July;</hi> though
Sir <hi>John Finch</hi> was impeached for the ſame thing of High Treaſon
in Parliament in 1640. So that if the Parliament were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
by the laſt long Prorogation, another Queſtion may now
ariſe, whether it was not ſo by their Separation, without either
Prorogation or Adjournment.</p>
                  <p>But in this time of War, it ſeems the <hi>French</hi> King was not at
leiſure to give Counſel; therefore when the Parliament met on
the tenth of <hi>July,</hi> Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi> ſignified, that it was
his Majeſty's Pleaſure they ſhould be adjourned to the Third of
<hi>December,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi> did again by his own Authority:
But before the Third of <hi>December,</hi> the King iſſued out his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
that he expected not the Members Attendance then,
but that thoſe about the Town might adjourn themſelves to the
Fourth of <hi>April, 1678;</hi> yet when the Houſe met the third of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi>
Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi> delivered the Houſe a Meſſage from
the King, that the Houſe ſhould be adjourned but to the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>January,</hi> 1677, which Mr. <hi>Seymor</hi> this third time did.</p>
                  <p>Thus did the Speaker make a threefold Invaſion upon the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of the Houſe, for the Houſe's once preſuming to invade his
Majeſty's Prerogative of making War and Peace.</p>
                  <p>In this Jumble of Adjournments, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> about
the End of <hi>September</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> and from <hi>Harwich</hi> rode
Poſt to <hi>New-Market,</hi> where the Court then was; his Buſineſs was
twofold, a Wife, and a Treaty with the King for the Preſervation
of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> terribly ſhaken by this laſt <hi>French</hi>
Campagn.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> was ſent into <hi>Holland,</hi> by the King, in <hi>July
1674,</hi> to mediate a Peace between the <hi>French</hi> King and <hi>States,</hi>
and after that to offer the King's Mediation for a general one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Confederates</hi> and <hi>French</hi> King. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of this, and the Prince jealous of it, ſo that the Governour
of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> refuſed Sir <hi>William</hi> a Guard to go to
the Prince, and the Prince declined Sir <hi>William</hi>'s coming to him;
ſo as Sir <hi>William</hi> was forced to return to <hi>Holland,</hi> and wait for the
Prince there till the Campagn was over.</p>
                  <p>After the Prince returned to the <hi>Hague,</hi> Sir <hi>William</hi> acquainted
him with the Powers the King had given him, and that the King
deſired to act in concert with the Prince, and therefore deſired,
ſo ſoon as might be, to underſtand the Prince's Opinion therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="508" facs="tcp:60932:260"/>
The Prince's Opinion was, That the <hi>States</hi> with any Faith
could not make a ſeparate Peace, and thereby expoſe the <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,</hi>
who had ſaved the <hi>States,</hi> to the Mercy of the <hi>French</hi>
King; nor could a general Peace be made unleſs <hi>Flanders</hi> was left
in a Condition to defend it ſelf: That it was in the King's Power
to induce <hi>France</hi> to what was juſt, and that the Prince muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
what his own Honour, as well as what the <hi>States</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to for their Allies, let it coſt what it would. This Anſwer
was coldly received by the King, ſo as he made no Reply to it.</p>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> poſſeſt the King, that it was Sir <hi>William</hi>'s ill
Management that the Prince was not pliable to the King's Deſires,
but if the King would imploy him in the Affair, by the Benefit
of his Lady's Relations, the Prince might be better diſpoſed: So
in <hi>November</hi> following the King ſent my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> upon this
Affair to the Prince, and my Lord <hi>Oſſery</hi> (who had married Madam
<hi>Beverwort,</hi> the Counteſs of <hi>Arlington</hi>'s Siſter.)</p>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> treated the Prince with that Authority, Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
and Inſolence, and ſo artificially, that the Prince, who
was of a plain and free Diſpoſition, could not bear it, but ſaid the
King never intended he ſhould treat him (the Prince) after that
manner: Sir <hi>William</hi> and my Lord too had Inſtructions to ſift the
Prince to a Diſcovery of Applications made to him by diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Perſons in <hi>England;</hi> and to enter into ſecret Meaſures with the
Prince, to aſſiſt the King againſt Rebels at home; and to ſweeten
all, my Lord <hi>Oſſery</hi> gave the Prince Hopes of a Match, with the
Princeſs <hi>Mary,</hi> the Duke's eldeſt Daughter: but the Prince would
not treat of a ſeparate Peace, was obſtinate againſt the ſecond,
ſaid that the third was a Diſreſpect to the King to think that he was
ſo ill beloved; and that his Fortunes were not in a Condition for
him to think of a Wife: ſo that my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> every way fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of his Expectation, loſt much of the King's Favour, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
diſſolved the Friendſhip and Confidence he believed he had
in the Prince.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, though my Lord <hi>Oſſery</hi> had above any other,
more bravely fought againſt the Prince's Intereſt by Sea in this laſt
War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> yet the Sympathy of their noble Natures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
a Friendſhip, which no Power leſs than Death could diſſolve;
and my Lord became Partaker with the Prince in that glorious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
againſt the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> upon the Relief of <hi>Mons,</hi>
the Succeſs of which was ſtopped by the unhappy ſeparate Peace
the <hi>States</hi> made with <hi>France;</hi> and the Propoſition which my Lord
made of the Match between the Prince and the Princeſs, made
ſuch an irreſiſtible Impreſſion in the Prince's Mind, that would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of no other Relief but Enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="509" facs="tcp:60932:260"/>
Though the Prince could not ſuppreſs, yet he concealed his
Deſires of matching with the Princeſs <hi>Mary,</hi> till a little before the
opening the Campagn 1676, when he diſcloſed them to Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Temple;</hi> but before he made any Paces towards the attaining
his Deſires, he deſired Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Opinion of the Perſon and
Diſpoſition of the Princeſs.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>William,</hi> who was glad to find the Prince's Reſolution to
marry, being a Debt due to his Family, and the rather becauſe
he was the only one of the Maſculine Line of it, replied, That he
knew nothing of his own Knowledg of the Diſpoſition of the
Princeſs, but had always heard his Wife and Siſter ſpeak with all
the Advantage that could be of what they could diſcern in a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
ſo young, and more by what had been told them by her
Governeſs.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Prince reſolved to write to the King and Duke,
and beg their Favours to him in it, and that my Lady <hi>Temple</hi> being
to go over into <hi>England,</hi> upon Sir <hi>William</hi>'s private Affairs, ſhould
deliver his Letters to both, and deſired that my Lady, during her
Stay in <hi>England,</hi> would endeavour moſt particularly to inform her
ſelf of all that concerned the Perſon, Humour and Diſpoſition of
the young Princeſs.</p>
                  <p>About two or three Days after the Prince brought his Letters to
my Lady <hi>Temple,</hi> he went to the Army; my Lady <hi>Temple</hi> into
<hi>England,</hi> and about the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> Sir <hi>William</hi> to <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi>
to aſſiſt with Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins</hi> as Mediators for a General
Peace.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>States</hi> were deſirous of Peace, yet durſt not break from
their Confederacy, not truſting <hi>England</hi> enough, nor <hi>France</hi> at all,
ſo as to have Dependency upon either after the Peace made: The
<hi>French</hi> knew the States were bent upon Peace, but the Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
any, but what was conſiſting with his Honour, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> ſo as to be a ſecure Barrier
to the <hi>States</hi> againſt the Power of <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Deſigns,
under the Covert of the general Peace to be treated at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi>
were to break the Confederacy, and therefore their Ambaſſadors,
the Marſhal <hi>D'Eſtrades,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> accoſted Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi>
and told him they had expreſs and private Orders from their
King to make particular Compliments to him, upon the Eſteem
their King had for his Perſon. They told him, they knew that
the States were bent for Peace, which could not be had unleſs the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> would interpoſe his Authority, which was ſo
great with the Allies that they were ſure the Allies would conſent
to whatever Terms the Prince ſhould propoſe for a Peace, and
therefore there was no Way to procure a happy Iſſue, but for the
Prince privately to agree with <hi>France,</hi> upon the Conditions, in
which the Prince might make uſe of the known Temper of the

                     <hi>States</hi> to bring it to a ſeparate Peace, in caſe the unreaſonable

                  <p>Sir <hi>William,</hi> in a well-compoſed Anſwer, acknowledged his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations

great Treaſure, and great Order of diſpoſing it: The <hi>French</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines
were always filled in the Winter, ſo as it enabled them to
take the Field as they pleaſed in the Spring, without fearing the
Weather for their Foot, or expecting Graſs for their Horſe. On
the other ſide, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> wanting Money and Order, left their
Troops in <hi>Flanders,</hi> neither capable to act by themſelves, nor in
Conjunction with others, upon any ſudden Attempt, nor to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with Proviſions, either <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>Germans,</hi> that ſhould come
to their Relief: and their Towns were ill fortified, and worſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;
ſo that the <hi>French</hi> King in <hi>April</hi> took <hi>Conde</hi> in four Days
and in <hi>May</hi> the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> took <hi>Bouchain,</hi> and the Prince of

                  <p>But neither the good Succeſs of the <hi>French</hi> this Campagn, nor
the ill Succeſs the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors had upon the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> to induce him to a ſeparate Peace, retarded the <hi>French</hi>
                     <pb n="511" facs="tcp:60932:261"/>
from purſuing of it; for the <hi>French,</hi> by their Emiſſaries in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but eſpecially at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> offer ſuch a Reglement of Trade
as the People could deſire; the Reſtitution of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and all
Satisfaction to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> he could pretend to upon his
Loſs, or their Seizures in the War. This put the Mob into a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of having a ſeparate Peace; nor could any thing have allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, but the noble Conſtancy of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> which ſtood
unſhaken, in oppoſing it in all theſe Difficulties.</p>
                  <p>However, this Campagn the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> in ſeveral
Encounters beat the <hi>Swede,</hi> and was in a hopeful State to have
expelled them out of <hi>Germany;</hi> and it had been juſt they had

Guarantees in the Triple League at <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> againſt the <hi>French</hi> King:
whereas the King of <hi>England</hi> ſtood ſtill, only looking on, whilſt
the <hi>French</hi> Arms by Piecemeals devoured them; and the King of
<hi>Sweden,</hi> in Conjunction with the <hi>French</hi> King, aſſiſting him in the
War. <hi>Put not your Truſt therefore in ſuch Princes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> however his Conſtancy in oppoſing a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
Peace was unſhaken, yet in the diſtracted State of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,
and the violent Humour of the Peoples running into it,
ſaw it was impoſſible to keep them out of it, unleſs the King of
<hi>England</hi> would interpoſe his Authority further, than by being a
bare Mediator, and acquainted the King with it: But the King, in
a long Letter under his own hand, inſtead of an Anſwer, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
That the Confederate Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> caballed with
Parliament-Men, and raiſed all Mens Spirits againſt Peace as high
as they could, ſo that it was difficult for him to make any Steps
with <hi>France</hi> towards a general Peace, unleſs the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſador
<hi>Van Beningham</hi> would put in a Memorial preſſing the King from
the <hi>States,</hi> to do it; and declared, that without it, all <hi>Flanders</hi>
would be loſt.</p>
                  <p>The Prince, to comply with the King, replied how willing he
was that <hi>Van Beningham</hi> ſhould put in ſuch a Memorial from the
<hi>States;</hi> and that if the King pleaſed to have a ſudden Peace, the
Prince thought it muſt be done upon the Foot of the Treaty of
<hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> which he would have the more Ground for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was a Peace which he both made and warranted.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> at this time was at the <hi>Hague,</hi> when his Colleague
Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins</hi> wrote to him, That there was a Negotiation of
a ſeparate Peace treating between the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning</hi>
(the <hi>Dutch</hi> Agent) at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> without any Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it to the Mediators; upon which Sir <hi>Lionel</hi> acquainted
the Court of <hi>England</hi> with it. Whereupon Orders were diſpatched,
That in caſe a ſeparate Peace was concluding, or concluded, the
Mediators ſhould publickly proteſt againſt it in his Majeſty's Name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="512" facs="tcp:60932:262"/>
This Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> wrote to my Lord Treaſurer, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
<hi>Coventry,</hi> That he could not underſtand the Reaſon of ſuch
a Proteſtation: for if a ſeparate Peace were thought ſo dangerous
at Court, as he knew it was in the Country, the King might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to prevent it, and had it ſtill in his Power, as he had
had a great while; but if it were once concluded, any other
Effect of ſuch a Proteſtation, unleſs it were to irritate both Parties,
and bind them the faſter, by our being angry at their Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
could not be expected: Nor did he know what Ground could
be given for ſuch a Proteſtation; for tho the Parties had accepted
the King's Mediation for a General Peace, yet none of them had
obliged themſelves to the King not to treat of a ſeparate one
without his Mediation; or if they had, he did not ſee why the
ſame Intereſts that could make them break through ſo many Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
to their Allies, ſhould not make them as bold with a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator:
That as to prevent the thing may be a very wiſe and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Counſel, ſo the King's Reſolution in it ought to be ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
as early as can be, where it is like to be of that moment to
<hi>France.</hi> But if the thing ſhould be firſt done, as he could not tell
how well to ground any Offence, ſo he could as little how to ſeek
Revenge, and it would be to ſtay till we were ſtruck, and then
truſt to crying out: That his Opinion was, it were better to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
one of the Parties before a ſeparate Peace, than both of them
after; and if we muſt ſtrain any Points of Controverſy with them,
to do it rather by making a fair and general Peace, than by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
and proteſting againſt a ſeparate one. But our Counſels
at Court, he ſays, were ſo in Ballance between the Deſires of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at leaſt fair with <hi>France,</hi> and the Fears of too much diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Parliament upon their frequent Seſſions, that our Paces
upon the whole Affair look'd all like croſs Purpoſes, which no
Man at home or abroad could well underſtand, and were often
miſtaken by both Parties engaged in the War, as well as by both
Parties in the Houſe of Commons, till the thing was wreſted out
of our hands.</p>
                  <p>Upon the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>January 1676-77,</hi> Sir <hi>William</hi> received Anſwer
from the King to his laſt Diſpatches by the Prince's Direction,
which conſiſted of two Parts; the firſt, an Offer of the King's En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the ſtrongeſt Alliance with the <hi>States,</hi> thereby to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them from all Apprehenſions from <hi>France,</hi> after the Peace
ſhould be made; the ſecond was, the King's Remarks rather than
Concluſions or Judgment upon the Terms propounded by the
Prince for a Peace; that he (the King) believed it might be
compaſſed with <hi>France,</hi> upon the Exchange of <hi>Cambray, Ayre,</hi>
and <hi>St. Omer,</hi> for <hi>Aeth, Charleroy, Oudenard, Conde,</hi> and <hi>Bouchain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Anſwer was ſo different from what the Prince propoſed,
ſo illuſive, and of ſo little Security to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that the Prince
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:60932:262"/>
told Sir <hi>William,</hi> that he would rather die than make ſuch a Peace;
and complained that the Offer of Alliance was wrote to him by the
King's own Hand, but this about the Terms of Peace from the
Secretary's Hand, which was in a Stile as if he thought the Prince
a Child, and to be fed with <hi>Whipp'd Cream:</hi> That ſince all this had
been before the foreign Committee, he knew very well it had been
with the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador too, and that the Terms were his,
and were a great deal worſe than if they had directly come from
<hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>French</hi> King's wheedling our King and the <hi>Dutch</hi> about
a ſeparate Peace, no ways abated the Vigour of his Proſecution of
the War whilſt Peace was mediating: for, in the beginning of the
Year he takes the Field with a huge Army, and block'd up <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi>
and <hi>Valenciennes</hi> about the End of <hi>February;</hi> and having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
ſufficient Magazines for Subſiſtence of his Forces, which
neither the <hi>Spaniard</hi> nor <hi>Germans</hi> had, broke into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and
into the Parts of <hi>Germany</hi> on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and with
the moſt cruel Ravages of burning and ſpoiling thoſe Parts of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
that could be exerciſed, and ſuch as had not been uſed on
either ſide ſince the War began. The Allies made Complaints of
this new manner of making War to his Majeſty (as Guarantee to
the Treaty at <hi>Aix la Chapelle)</hi> who employed his Offices towards
<hi>France</hi> to hinder ſuch Proceedings; but the Things was done, and
the Point gained, which was by an entire Ruin of thoſe Countries,
from hindring the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> from finding any Subſiſtence for
their Troops if they ſhould march into <hi>Alſatia,</hi> and thereby divert
thoſe Forces the <hi>French</hi> reſolved to employ in <hi>Flanders,</hi> before the
<hi>Dutch</hi> could take the Field and march to the Relief of thoſe Places
they intended to attack.</p>
                  <p>Before any <hi>Dutch, Spaniſh,</hi> or <hi>German</hi> Army could be brought
into the Field, the <hi>French</hi> took <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> and laid Siege to
<hi>St. Omer</hi> and <hi>Cambray:</hi> But before they had taken <hi>St. Omer,</hi> the
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> with the Forces of the <hi>States,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
him with no Forces, not ſo much as Guides, reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, tho with the hazard of a Battel. But the Duke of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
leaving a part of his Forces to defend the Trenches, and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> with all the Troops the <hi>French</hi>
King could ſend, met the Prince at <hi>Mount Caſſel;</hi> where, after a
ſharp Diſpute, the firſt Regiment of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Infantry began to
break into Diſorder: The Prince went immediately to that Place
where the Shock began, rallied them ſeveral times, and renewed
the Charge; but at laſt was born down by the plain Flight of his
Men, whom he was forced to reſiſt as Enemies, and fall in among
them with Sword in hand, and cut the firſt over the Face, and
cried out aloud, <hi>Raſcal, I'll ſet a Mark on thee at least, that I may
hang thee at last.</hi> But neither Voice, Action, Threats, nor Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:60932:263"/>
would give Courage to Men that had already loſt it: ſo he
was forced to recoil to thoſe Troops which ſtood firm, and made
ſo brave a Retreat, as was near equal to a Victory: So as <hi>Flanders</hi>
had only <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Namur</hi> for a Frontier by Land, and <hi>Newport</hi>
and <hi>Oſtend</hi> by Sea. However, the Prince made an Attempt upon
<hi>Charleroy,</hi> which did not ſucceed.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Prince ſeeing all Attempts againſt the <hi>French</hi>
would be in vain, unleſs the King came in to aſſiſt the Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Allies, ſent Monſieur <hi>Bentink</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> to deſire the
King's Leave to make a Journey into <hi>England</hi> ſo ſoon as the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagn
was over; to which he received this cold Anſwer, <hi>That the
Prince would firſt think of making the Peace, and rather defer his
Journey till that were concluded.</hi> Could any Man now believe any
other Prince ſhould be ſo ſupine as not to apprehend the imminent
Danger his Nephew ſtood in, and in conſequence his own Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions?
And tho all the World but he ſaw and dreaded this, yet
the King, as at the End of the firſt <hi>Dutch</hi> War, would not. This
was about the beginning of <hi>June;</hi> and about the middle of it, Sir
<hi>William Temple</hi>'s Son brought him Letters from my Lord Treaſurer,
That he ſhould come over and enter upon the Secretary's Place,
which Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi> had offer'd to lay down upon the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> and that the King would pay half the Money,
and the Treaſurer muſt lay down the reſt at preſent; but did not
doubt but the King would find a way of eaſing him of that too.</p>
                  <p>What could be expected in ſuch a Reign, where Secretaries of
State, who are the Eyes of the King and Kingdom, to take Care of
all foreign and domeſtick Affairs, which cannot be carried on
without Charges, ſhould purchaſe their Places, and thereby not
only diſable them in the Performance of their Office, but utterly to
neglect it, and make it their Buſineſs how they may be Gainers by
their Purchaſe they had ſo dearly bought? But Sir <hi>William</hi> excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it, as not being able to raiſe 5000 <hi>l.</hi> now his Father was
alive: And tho Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi> came cheap enough by the
Place, it ſeems he was either unwilling Sir <hi>William</hi> ſhould ſucceed
him in it, or that he would not truſt to the 5000 <hi>l.</hi> to be paid by
the King, unleſs he might chuſe his Succeſſor, who, it may be,
would have given him 15000 <hi>l.</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p>After Sir <hi>William</hi> came over, and the Bargain for the Secretary's
Place not ſucceeding, the King had often Conferences with him
about the Peace, and the Prince's coming into <hi>England:</hi> he had a
great Deſire for the firſt, but not for the other, till the firſt were
done. He ſaid his Parliament would never be quiet with him
while the War laſted, and then leave him in it, unleſs they might
have their Terms in removing and filling Places, which he ſhould
be very loth to be ſo much at their Mercy; and that the longer
the War continued, the worſe it would be for the Confederates,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:60932:263"/>
and worſe for <hi>Flanders,</hi> and therefore would have the Prince
make a Peace for them if they would not do it themſelves; and
that if the Prince and he would fall into Terms about it, he was
ſure it might be done; and deſired Sir <hi>William</hi> to make a ſhort
Turn to the Prince, and try if he could perſwade the Prince to it:
But Sir <hi>William</hi> excuſed it, and deſired Mr. <hi>Hide</hi> (now Earl of
<hi>Rocheſter,</hi> who was then at <hi>Nimeguen)</hi> might do it: but I don't
find any thing came of it.</p>
                  <p>About the latter End of <hi>September,</hi> as before noted, the Prince
took his Journey for <hi>England,</hi> and landed at <hi>Harwich,</hi> and from
thence came to <hi>New-Market,</hi> where the Court then was; where
he was kindly received by the King and Duke, who both invited
him often into Diſcourſe of Buſineſs, which the Prince avoided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly,
ſo as the King bid Sir <hi>William</hi> ask the Prince the
Reaſon of it: the Prince told him, he was reſolved to ſee the
young Princeſs before he enter'd into that Affair, and get to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in that before the other of Peace: whereupon the King, to
humour him, left <hi>New-market</hi> ſome Days ſooner than he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and came to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prince, at firſt ſight, was ſo pleaſed with her Perſon, and
all thoſe Signs of ſuch a Humour as had been before deſcribed to
him, that he immediately made his Suit to the King and Duke,
which was well received and aſſented to, but upon Condition the
Terms of Peace abroad might be firſt agreed to between them. The
Prince excuſed himſelf, and ſaid, he muſt end his firſt Buſineſs
before the other. The King and Duke were both poſitive other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
that that of Peace ſhould precede: but the Prince continu'd
reſolute for the former, and ſaid, His Allies were like to have hard
Terms of Peace as things ſtood, and would be apt to believe he
had made this Match at their Coſt; and for his part, he would
never ſell his Honour for a Wife: But the King and Duke conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in their Reſolution for three or four Days.</p>
                  <p>In the Obſtinacy of theſe contrary Reſolutions between the
King, Duke, and Prince, Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> chanced to go to the
Prince one Evening after Supper, and found him in the worſt Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
he had ever ſeen him in; and told Sir <hi>William,</hi> he repented
he ever came into <hi>England,</hi> and reſolved he would ſtay but two
Days longer, if the King continued in his Mind of treating upon
the Peace before Marriage; and that before he went, the King
muſt chuſe how they muſt live hereafter; for he was ſure it muſt
be like either the greateſt Friends or the greateſt Enemies: and
preſſed Sir <hi>William</hi> to let the King know ſo next Morning, and
give him an Account what he ſhould ſay upon it.</p>
                  <p>Next Morning Sir <hi>William</hi> told the King all the Prince had ſaid
to him, and the ill Conſequences of a Breach between them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the ill Humours of ſo many of his Subjects upon our late
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:60932:264"/>
Meaſures with <hi>France,</hi> and the Invitations made to the Prince by
ſeveral of them during the late War. The King heard Sir <hi>William</hi>
with great Attention; and when he had done, ſaid, Well, I was
never deceived in judging of a Man's Honeſty by his Looks; and
if I am not deceived in the Prince's Face, he is the honeſteſt Man
in the World, and I will truſt him, and he ſhall have his Wife,
and you ſhall go immediately and tell my Brother ſo, and that 'tis
a thing I am reſolved on.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> did ſo, and the Duke at firſt ſeemed a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd;
but when Sir <hi>William</hi> had done, the Duke ſaid, the King
ſhall be obey'd, and I would be glad all his Subjects would learn of
me to obey him.</p>
                  <p>From the Duke, Sir <hi>William</hi> went to the Prince, and told him
all this Story: At firſt the Prince ſeem'd diffident, but ſoon em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
Sir <hi>William,</hi> and told him he had made him a very happy
Man, and that unexpectedly; and ſo he left the Prince, to give
the King an Account of what paſſed, and in the Prince's Ante-Chamber
met my Lord Treaſurer, who undertook to adjuſt all
the reſt between the King and the Prince, which he did ſo well,
that the Match was declared that Evening at the Committee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any other in the Court knew any thing of it.</p>
                  <p>When the Match was known, the Nation entertained it with an
univerſal Joy: yet the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador and my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi>
were diſpleaſed at it; the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, becauſe he had not
given his Maſter an Account of it; and my Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
nothing of near ſuch moment had paſſed, and he not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with it: and within two or three Days after, the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
was conſummate.</p>
                  <p>The Prince having ſo happily gained the firſt part of his Deſign
in coming into <hi>England,</hi> the Terms of Peace were agitated imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
and Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> was admitted to be preſent at the
Debates. The Prince inſiſted upon the Strength and Enlargement
of a Frontier on both ſides of <hi>Flanders;</hi> otherwiſe he ſaid <hi>France</hi>
would end this War with the View of beginning another, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
<hi>Flanders</hi> in one Campagn.</p>
                  <p>The King was content to leave that Buſineſs a little looſer, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Confidence that <hi>France</hi> was ſo weary of the War, that if they
could get out of it with Honour, they would never begin another
in this Reign: that the King was paſt his Youth, and lazy, and
would turn to the Pleaſures of the Court and Buildings, and leave
his Neighbours at quiet.</p>
                  <p>But the Prince thought <hi>France</hi> would not make a Peace now,
but to break the preſent Confederacy, and to begin another War
with more Advantage and Surprize: that their Ambition would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
end till they had all <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and
thereby <hi>Holland</hi> in an abſolute Dependance upon them, and us in
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:60932:264"/>
no good one: and, that <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> could not be left ſafe by the
Peace, without a Frontier as he propoſed for <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of <hi>Lorain,</hi> as well as what the Emperour had loſt in <hi>Alſatia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> told the King, that in the Courſe of his Life,
he had never obſerved Mens Natures alter by Age or Fortune, but
that a good Boy made a good Man, a young Coxcomb an old Fool,
and a young Fripon an old Knave; that quiet Spirits were ſo, and
unquiet would be ſo, old as well as young; that he believed the
<hi>French</hi> King would have always ſome Bent or other, ſometimes
War, ſometimes Love, ſometimes Building; but was of the Prince's
Opinion, that he would ne'r make Peace but with a Deſign of a
new War, after he had fixed his Conqueſts by the laſt.</p>
                  <p>The King approved of what Sir <hi>William</hi> had ſaid, and the Points
of <hi>Lorain</hi> and <hi>Alſatia</hi> were eaſily agreed to by the King and Duke,
but they would not hear of the Reſtitution of the County of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi>
(tho it were part of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> which the
King was obliged to protect againſt <hi>France,</hi> by the Treaty of <hi>Aix)</hi>
as what <hi>France</hi> would never be brought to; yet the Prince inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much upon it; which the King imagined was by reaſon of the
Prince's own Lands in that Country, (which are greater and more
<hi>Seignurial</hi> than thoſe of the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> there) and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the King told the Prince, That for his Lands there, he would
charge himſelf, that the Prince ſhould enjoy them as ſafe under
<hi>France</hi> as under <hi>Spain;</hi> or if the Prince would part with them,
the King would undertake to get him what Price he would value
them at: to which the Prince generouſly reply'd, That he would
not trouble himſelf nor the Peace about that matter; and that he
would be content to loſe all his Lands there, to get one good
Town more for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> upon the Frontier of <hi>Flanders.</hi> So
here the King and Prince agreed.</p>
                  <p>But then another Debate aroſe between the King and Prince,
one pretending <hi>France</hi> would never be brought to this Scheme,
the other that <hi>Spain</hi> would never be brought to it; but at laſt
it was agreed, that the Peace ſhould be made upon theſe Terms:
All to be reſtored by <hi>France</hi> to the Emperor and Empire, that
had been taken in the War; and the Dutchy of <hi>Lorain</hi> to the
Duke, and all on both ſides between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland:</hi> and to
<hi>Spain,</hi> the Towns of <hi>Aeth, Charleroy, Oudenard, Courtray, Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,
Conde, Valenciennes, St. Gillain</hi> and <hi>Binch,</hi> which were nine
Towns: that the King ſhall endeavour to procure the Conſent of
<hi>France,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Spain:</hi> And to this purpoſe, the King
ſhould ſend ſome Perſon immediately over with the Propoſition,
who ſhould be inſtructed to enter into no Reaſoning upon it, but
demand a poſitive Anſwer in two Days; and after that term, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
return. And then the King ordered Sir <hi>William</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two Days to make himſelf ready to go and acquaint the <hi>French</hi>
with it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="518" facs="tcp:60932:265"/>
At this Agreement between the King and Prince none were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
beſides the Duke, my Lord Treaſurer, and Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi>
ſo as the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador was as much ſurprized in it, as before
he was at the Marriage of the Prince: but this could not be longer
conceal'd from him, than when it began to be put in Practice;
yet it ſeems to me he was acquainted with it before, and that the
King had taken other Reſolutions than what was agreed upon but
the Day before.</p>
                  <p>For Sir <hi>William</hi> having prepared all things in a Readineſs
to go, the Evening before, he met the King in the Park (St.
<hi>James</hi>'s) who call'd to him, and told him he had been thinking
upon Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Errand, and how unwelcome he ſhould be
in <hi>France,</hi> as well as the Meſſage; and that having a Mind to
gain Peace, he was unwilling to anger them more than needs:
beſides, the thing being not to be debated or reaſoned, any Body
elſe would ſerve the Turn as well as he, whom he had other
uſe of. Sir <hi>William</hi> was very glad of it, knowing how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
a Meſſenger he ſhould be upon this Account. Then
the King asked Sir <hi>William</hi> what he thought of my Lord <hi>Duras,</hi>
(a <hi>French</hi>-man, and a great Favourite of the Duke's, and ſince
Earl of <hi>Feverſham.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems the King asked Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Opinion only for Form
and Faſhion ſake, for the thing was the Morning before agreed
upon, at the Deſire of the Duke, upon pretence that <hi>France</hi>
would accept of the Terms, and that he had a Mind to have the
Honour of it by ſending a Servant of his own. So my Lord
<hi>Duras</hi> went immediately after with the Orders; and ſome few
Days after, the Prince and Princeſs embarked for <hi>Holland,</hi> where
Affairs preſſed his Return, beyond the Hopes of my Lord <hi>Duras</hi>
from <hi>France,</hi> the King aſſuring the Prince he would never part
with the leaſt part of the Scheme ſent over, and would enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a War with <hi>France,</hi> if they refuſed it. But <hi>(pudet haec)</hi> you'll
ſoon ſee another Face of Affairs after the Prince was gone; nay
before he went, it was a great Mortification to him, to ſee the
Parliament prorogued till the next Spring; which the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
had gained of the King, to make up ſome good Meen
with <hi>France,</hi> after the Prince's Marriage, and before the Diſpatch
of the Terms of a Peace to that Court. I ſhould not have ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to ſay this, if that honourable Gentleman Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi>
in his ſecond <hi>Memoirs,</hi> which are printed, fol. 302. had not ſaid
it before.</p>
                  <p>But how honourable and ſincere ſoever the Prince's Actions
were in the Management of this whole Affair, the outward Face
of things had another Appearance, which cauſed great Jealouſies
of him, not only among the <hi>Amſterdamers,</hi> and Common People
in <hi>Holland,</hi> but even among the Conſederates; for the Prince
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:60932:265"/>
ſending Monſieur <hi>Bentink</hi> privately over into <hi>England</hi> about the
beginning of <hi>June,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> ſo ſoon after follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the Prince's raiſing the Siege before <hi>Charl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y</hi> the next
day after my Lord <hi>Oſſory</hi> came to his Camp, and the Prince's go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>September</hi> following into <hi>England;</hi> theſe things thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring,
paſſed not without many Reflections, not only in <hi>Holland,</hi>
but among the Allies, as if there were Intelligences between the
King and him, which were heightned by the Marriage; the main
Buſineſs of the Treaty made by the King and Prince about the
Peace being yet in <hi>Embrio;</hi> ſo as the Prince and Princeſs were
coldly received in <hi>Holland</hi> upon the Prince's Return; and theſe
Jealouſies encreaſed more upon the Tranſactions between the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Court</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> But ſacred Truth, and the Integrity of the
Prince, ſhall vindicate his Honour, even among thoſe who moſt
ſuſpected him, and were ſo jealous of his Actions.</p>
                  <p>The Noiſe of a Peace with <hi>France</hi> ſo ſoon after the proroguing
the Parliament, raiſed a Ferment in the Nation, of ſome Deſign
of the Court, as dangerous to the Nation as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Jealouſies
that their Liberties were in by the Prince's Treaty and Marriage
with a Daughter of <hi>England.</hi> And now the Prince was gone, and
out of Sight, he was out of Mind too by the King, in reſpect to
the Terms of Peace agreed to, and the ſolemn Promiſe the King
made to the Prince upon his Departure, that he would never par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
with the leaſt Point in the Scheme ſent into <hi>France,</hi> and make
War upon it if it were refuſed.</p>
                  <p>For upon my Lord <hi>Duras</hi>'s Arrival at <hi>Paris,</hi> the Court were
ſurprized, at leaſt ſeemed ſo, both at the thing, and more upon
the manner of it; yet made good Meen upon it, took it gently,
and ſaid, <hi>The King (of</hi> England) <hi>knew very well he might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
Maſter of the Peace: but ſome few Towns in</hi> Flanders <hi>ſeemed
very hard, eſpecially</hi> Tournay, <hi>upon whoſe Fortifications ſuch vast
Treaſure had been expended; and that they would take ſome ſhort time
to conſider of the Offer.</hi> But my Lord <hi>Duras</hi> told them he was tied
to two Days ſtay, but when that was out, was prevailed upon to
ſtay ſome few Days longer, <hi>(which he durſt not have done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſecret Orders from our Court contrary to his Inſtructions)</hi> and at
laſt came away without any poſitive Anſwer. Hereupon the
King, inſtead of declaring War againſt <hi>France,</hi> as he ſo ſolemnly
promiſed the Prince, entred into a Treaty with the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
at <hi>London,</hi> which by <hi>French</hi> Artifice was ſo ſpun out in
length, without any poſitive Refuſal, that the Blow came to be
eluded which could not otherwiſe be avoided, as Sir <hi>William Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
ſays, <hi>tho I believe it was intended even when the Prince went out
of</hi> England.</p>
                  <p>However, about the latter end of <hi>December</hi> 1677, the King ſent
to Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> to the Foreign Committee, and told him he
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:60932:266"/>
could get no poſitive Anſwer from <hi>France,</hi> and therefore reſolved
to ſend him into <hi>Holland,</hi> to make a League there with the <hi>States</hi>
for forcing <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> into a Peace upon the Terms propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
if either refuſed. To which Sir <hi>William</hi> told the King, <hi>what
he had agreed was, to enter into a War with all the Confederates in
caſe of no direct and immediate Anſwer from</hi> France. <hi>That this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
would ſatisfy the Prince and Confederates abroad, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at home: But to make ſuch a League with</hi> Holland <hi>only, would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
none of them, and diſoblige both</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spain. <hi>Beſides, it
would not have ſuch an Effect or Force as the Triple Alliance had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great Original, of which this ſeemed an ill Copy:</hi> And therefore
excuſed himſelf from going. And ſo the King ſent Mr. <hi>Thyn</hi> with
a Draught of the Treaty to Mr. <hi>Hide,</hi> who was then come from
<hi>Nimeguen</hi> to the <hi>Hague,</hi> upon a Viſit to the Princeſs, which was
done, and the Treaty ſigned the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> (tho not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great Diſſatisfaction to the Prince.)</p>
                  <p>This Tergiverſation of the Court ſet fire to the Jealouſies in
<hi>Holland,</hi> eſpecially at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> that the Prince by this Marriage
had taken Meaſures with the King as dangerous to the Liberties of
<hi>Holland,</hi> and make it there believed, that by this Match the King
and Duke had wholly drawn the Prince into their Intereſts and
Sentiments. The <hi>French</hi> hereupon propoſed other Terms of Peace
to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> far ſhort of the King's, and leſs ſafe for <hi>Flanders,</hi>
reſtoring only ſix Towns to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and mentioning <hi>Lorain</hi>
but ambiguouſly, which would not have gone down in <hi>Holland</hi> but
for the Suſpicions raiſed by the Prince's Marriage among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
there, who had an incurable Jealouſy of our Court, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
not that Confidence in the Prince that he deſerved.</p>
                  <p>If we take this Reign as one thing, you'll find it made up of
almoſt infinite Confuſions and Diſorders, and ſcarce one regular
Act in it; and now we are come to one which is without any
Precedent, which was this: You heard before how the King to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador for not acquainting him with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with the Prince, had prorogued the Parliament to the <hi>8th</hi> of
<hi>April</hi> next, <hi>viz.</hi> 1678. And now Mr. <hi>Thyn</hi> had made this League
with the <hi>States,</hi> the King thought this a good occaſion to get
Money from the Parliament upon it, and was loth to ſtay till the
<hi>8th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> for it; and therefore by his Proclamation, commands
the Parliament to meet upon the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> before the <hi>8th</hi>
of <hi>April.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prorogations of Parliaments are new, and I think were never
heard of in <hi>England</hi> before the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, and are ſaid
to be the Acts of the King, but Adjournments the Acts of the
Houſe to a certain Time and Place, and both Houſes muſt be ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and in being when they are either ſo prorogued or adjourned.

                        </gap>leman</hi>'s Letters the Court
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:60932:266"/>
were mightily ſurprized at it, and the Parliament was to have met
ſome few days after upon a Prorogation, which the King in that
Surprize unwilling they ſhould, did therefore call a Council to
adviſe whether he might not prorogue them to a further day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Houſes meeting, and 'twas ſaid my Lord Chancellor <hi>Finch</hi> was
of Opinion he might; and thereupon Sir <hi>Edward Seymour,</hi> Speaker
of the Houſe of Commons, having Occaſions in the Country, went
out of Town: but ſome body acquainted the King of the
Doubtfulneſs of the Chancellor's Opinion, and deſired the King to
adviſe with old <hi>John Brown,</hi> who had been Clerk of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for near forty Years; the King did ſo, and <hi>John Brown</hi> was
poſitive, that in caſe the Houſes did not meet at the Time and
Place appointed, the King by his Proclamation could not prorogue
them, but it would be a Diſſolution of the Parliament: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Speaker was ſent for back again, and ſo many of both
Houſes met as would make a Parliament (which it's ſaid is forty
Commoners and ſeven Lords) and then the King prorogued them.
But this Conſideration was not (that I find) taken notice of
by either Houſe, tho both met according to the King's Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The Houſes thus met, the King acquainted them with the
League he had made with <hi>Holland,</hi> and demanded Money of them
to carry on the War againſt <hi>France,</hi> in caſe <hi>France</hi> did not comply
with the League; whereupon the Parliament granted him a Tex
by Poll, and otherways, which amounted to 1200000 <hi>l.</hi> not for
Peace, but to enter into an actual War with <hi>France:</hi> But this Tax
ſhall only beget another, to disband an Army raiſed upon that
Pretence, tho no War was entred into againſt <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſo far was the <hi>French</hi> King from giving up any Towns, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Agreement the King had made with the Prince,
or the League he had made with <hi>Holland,</hi> that about the latter
end of <hi>January</hi> he had made an Attempt upon <hi>Ipre,</hi> and threatned
<hi>Oſtend,</hi> and in <hi>March</hi> following, by open Force, takes both <hi>Ipre</hi>
and <hi>Gaunt;</hi> yet the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador here continued his Court
and Treaty with all the Fairneſs that might be.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> having now taken <hi>Ipre</hi> and <hi>Gaunt,</hi> were ſo far from
proceeding in any Treaty either with <hi>England,</hi> the Confederates, or
<hi>Holland,</hi> or in the Treaty at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> that about the firſt of <hi>April</hi>
the <hi>French</hi> King made publick Declaration of the Terms upon
which he reſolved to make Peace, which, tho very different from
thoſe agreed upon between the King and <hi>Holland,</hi> and more from
the Pretenſions of the Allies, yet this way of treating the <hi>French</hi>
purſued in the whole Negotiation afterwards, declaring ſuch and
ſuch were the Conditions, which they would admit, and no other,
and upon which the Enemies might chuſe either War or Peace,
and to which <hi>France</hi> would not be tied longer than the <hi>10th</hi> of
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:60932:267"/>
                     <hi>May,</hi> after which they would be at Liberty to change or reſtrain
as they ſhould think fit.</p>
                  <p>But how imperious ſoever the <hi>French</hi> were abroad, yet they
dreaded a Conjunction of <hi>England</hi> either with the <hi>Dutch</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,
and therefore thought fit to wheedle our Court till the
Affairs of the Confederates ſhould become ſo deſperate as to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to what Terms the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould impoſe upon them:
And to this purpoſe Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> (now Earl) ſent a Pacquet to
my Lord Treaſurer, giving an account of a large Conference Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Louvoy</hi> (the <hi>French</hi> King's grand Miniſter of State) had with
him by the King his Maſter's Order, wherein he repreſented the
Meaſures they had already taken for a Peace in <hi>Holland</hi> upon the
<hi>French</hi> Terms; and that ſince they were agreed there, they hoped
his Majeſty would not be againſt it: That however, <hi>France</hi> had
ordered him to make his Majeſty the Offer of a great Sum of
Money for his Conſent, tho the thing was already accepted by
<hi>Holland,</hi> and wherein his Majeſty was conſequently not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador at <hi>London</hi> (confident this Bait would
take the King) began to change his Language, <hi>That his Majeſty
ſhould be Arbiter of the Peace:</hi> But now being aſſured his Maſter
had agreed with <hi>Holland,</hi> he ſeem'd to wonder and expoſtulate why
the King ſhould pretend to obtain better Terms for the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
than the <hi>Dutch</hi> their Allies were content with.</p>
                  <p>You have heard the Agreement between the King and Prince
before he went into <hi>Holland,</hi> as well on the behalf of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
and Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> as of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and how it was
not obſerved by the King, and of the time when the Prince ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
in <hi>Holland,</hi> and of the unjuſt Jealouſies had upon the Prince
thereby, as well by the Confederates as by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and of the
ſeparate League the King made with the <hi>States,</hi> for enforcing the
<hi>French</hi> to come up to the Agreement between the King and Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> and how the King had got twelve hundred thouſand
Pounds of the Parliament for entring into an actual War with
<hi>France,</hi> and how the <hi>French</hi> King, in defiance of the King and
<hi>States,</hi> inſtead of giving up any Towns, had taken <hi>Ipre</hi> and <hi>Gaunt,</hi>
as well contrary to this Agreement and League as to the Treaty
of <hi>Aix:</hi> Now let's ſee how the King proceeded, after the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
contrary to the League with the King, had accepted the <hi>French</hi>
Terms.</p>
                  <p>Having got the Money of the Parliament for making the League
with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> upon the Terms agreed upon by the Prince, he
now ſaw no reaſon why he ſhould not get the Money the <hi>French</hi>
offer'd him if he would agree to the Terms he had made with the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> and to that purpoſe order'd Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> to treat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it with the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, who had Orders to that purpoſe:
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:60932:267"/>
Sir <hi>William</hi> would have excuſed it, but the King told him he could
not help ſeeing him, for the Ambaſſador would be at his Houſe
next Morning by ſeven a Clock, and then he came, but Sir <hi>William</hi>
told him he had been very ill in the Night, and could not enter
into Buſineſs; ſo the Ambaſſador was diſappointed of his Deſign
at that time: However the Bargain went on, not only for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
but ſomething elſe, ſo that Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 321.
There was one Article in this private Treaty the King took ſuch
Indignation at, that he would never forget it whilſt he lived.</p>
                  <p>There was but one Accident favourable to the Confederates in
all theſe Treaties, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>French</hi> apprehenſive of a Conjunction
between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who at this time were much more
powerful at Sea than <hi>France,</hi> thought they might block up <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
by Sea, while the <hi>Spaniard</hi> beſieged it by Land, and ſo might
loſe all the Cannon, Proviſions and Stores they had in it; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
which, they abandoned it while it was in their Power to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
their Effects there, and left the <hi>Meſſinians</hi> their Confederates
to the Mercy of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beverning</hi> was the Agent which managed this Treaty upon the
<hi>French</hi> Terms, and <hi>Beverning</hi> was ſent to the <hi>French</hi> Camp, where
the Terms of Peace were concluded about the latter end of <hi>June,</hi>
and a Ceſſation of Arms for ſix Weeks, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might
come into the Peace upon the Terms propoſed: But if they ſhould
not, his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty aſſured the <hi>States,</hi> that he would
always provide ſuch a Barrier in <hi>Flanders,</hi> as they thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for their Safety; and after the Peace ſhould be made, and
the antient Amity reſtored, he would be ready to enter into ſuch
Engagements with them as ſhould for ever ſecure their Repoſe and
their Liberties, <hi>viz. he would be the Fox that ſhould preſerve theſe
Geeſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indignation will not ſuffer this to paſs over without Reflection,
that the World may ſee what Truſt is to be given to <hi>French</hi> Faith.
Did not he make this War upon the <hi>Dutch, only becauſe of the ill
Satisfaction he had of the</hi> Dutch Behaviour <hi>toward him, being riſen
to that degree, that he could no longer, without Diminution of his
Glory, diſſemble his Indignation againſt them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to make War againſt them by Sea and Land?</hi> Did he not in
the beginning of this War, by all <hi>French</hi> Artifice, court the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> to take upon him the Soveraignty of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces?
Did not his Ambaſſadors court Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner
<hi>Fagel,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> themſelves, and that the Prince ſhould
make what Terms he pleaſed, ſo as to make a ſeparate Peace?
And now he is making a ſeparate Peace with a pack of factious
<hi>Dutch,</hi> of the <hi>Louveſtein</hi> Faction, oppoſite to the Prince, to
wheedle them, that after the Peace was made he would enter into
ſuch Engagements with them as ſhould for ever ſecure their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:60932:268"/>
and their Liberties, meaning to depoſe the Prince from
having any Power or Authority with them.</p>
                  <p>In this hopeful Security of this Faction relying upon <hi>French</hi>
Faith, the Marqueſs <hi>de Balbaces</hi> propoſed when the ſix Towns in
<hi>Flanders</hi> ſhould be given up to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> upon the <hi>French</hi> Terms

                     <hi>French</hi> take all <hi>Flanders,</hi> and impoſe what Terms they pleaſe upon
the reſt of the Confederates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beverning</hi> could not tell what to ſay to this, and acquaints the
<hi>States</hi> with it; the <hi>States</hi> were confounded at it, and could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tell what to do, nor to whom to complain: To the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
they were aſham'd to complain, who had ſo generouſly entred
into the War for their Preſervation, when otherwiſe they had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
under the <hi>French</hi> Tyranny without poſſibility of Relief, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had great reaſon to be offended at their endeavouring to make
a ſeparate Peace, thereby to expoſe them to the Fury and Tyranny
of the <hi>French</hi> Arms; and the Counſels of the Court of <hi>England</hi>
were ſo looſe that no Reliance could be had upon them: But it
was <hi>Hobſon</hi>'s Choice, that or nothing.</p>
                  <p>That we may take all fair before us, let's now ſee the Fruits the
<hi>Dutch</hi> had of their Ceſſation of Arms for ſix Weeks, to try if
they could bring in the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to comply with the Terms which
the <hi>French</hi> had impoſed upon <hi>Beverning</hi> and his Faction, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
ſix of the nine Towns to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> which was agreed
upon between the King and Prince, and alſo by the League which
the King made with the <hi>States:</hi> The <hi>French</hi> King after he had
taken <hi>Ipre</hi> and <hi>Gaunt, Luxemburg</hi> proceeded to block up <hi>Mons,</hi> and
<hi>Schomberg</hi> threatned to beſiege <hi>Cologn:</hi> and thus the <hi>Dutch</hi> bound
Hand and Foot had no body elſe to complain to, or expect any
Relief from, but the Court of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> had a little before ſent over one <hi>Van Lewen,</hi> who was
the chief of the Town of <hi>Leyden</hi> (who Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> ſays,
was a Man of great Honour and Worth) to treat with the King to
enter into a War againſt <hi>France,</hi> which the King was obliged to by
the League with them, and had received 1200000 <hi>l.</hi> of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
for carrying it on; and by <hi>Van Lewen</hi> the <hi>States</hi> acquaint
the King with the Terms upon which the <hi>French</hi> King would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
the ſix Towns in <hi>Flanders</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> the King at firſt
ſeemed not to believe it, but having ſent to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:60932:268"/>
                     <hi>(Barillon)</hi> to know the Truth of this; which the Ambaſſador
owning, he ſeemed ſurprized and angry at this proceeding of
<hi>France,</hi> and next Morning ſent for Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> to the Foreign
Committee, and there declar'd his Reſolution of ſending him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
into <hi>Holland</hi> with a Commiſſion to ſign a Treaty with the
<hi>States,</hi> by which they ſhould carry on the War, and the King to
enter into it in caſe <hi>France</hi> ſhould not conſent to evacuate the
Towns within a certain time limited; and the King took Pains to
preſs <hi>Van Lewen</hi> to go over with Sir <hi>William</hi> to perſwade the <hi>States</hi>
of the King's Sincereneſs and Conſtancy to purſue theſe Meaſures
to the utmoſt of his Power.</p>
                  <p>Armed with theſe Powers, away goes Sir <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Van
Lewen,</hi> and were received with all imaginable Joy by the <hi>Dutch;</hi>
and Sir <hi>William</hi> by the Prince, hoping by his Errand and Succeſs
of it, either to continue the War, or to recover ſuch Conditions
of Peace for his Allies as had been forced out of his Hands by
force of a Faction begun at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and after ſpread into the
reſt of the Provinces: All the Provinces, even thoſe which were
ſo forward for the Peace upon the <hi>French</hi> Terms, were ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in this Negotiation, that in ſix days the Treaty was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded;
by which <hi>France</hi> was obliged to declare within fourteen
days after the Date thereof, that they would evacuate the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Towns, or in caſe of Refuſal, <hi>Holland</hi> was engaged to go
on with the War, and <hi>England</hi> immediately to declare it againſt
<hi>France</hi> in Conjunction with <hi>Holland,</hi> and the reſt of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates.
Here obſerve, that tho Sir <hi>William</hi> was one of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators
of Peace at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> yet whilſt this Negotiation was
perfected, his Poſt was to be at the <hi>Hague,</hi> for a Tale depends
upon it.</p>
                  <p>The Wiſdom, as well as the Integrity of the Prince in the
whole Negotiation of this Affair, was now ſo conſpicuous, that
the <hi>States</hi> owned the Prince had made a truer Judgment than they
had done of the Meaſures which they were to expect either from
<hi>England</hi> or <hi>France;</hi> and if it happens that <hi>England</hi> in this Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
ſhall prove as fickle and looſe as before, yet this ſhall never
be aſcribed to the Prince, who was always the ſame he was before.
So now all Preparations were made for the Relief of <hi>Mons,</hi> and
ten thouſand <hi>Engliſh</hi> being arrived in <hi>Flanders,</hi> who were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to join the Prince, he reſolved to relieve <hi>Mons,</hi> or to die in
the Attempt.</p>
                  <p>After the Treaty concluded, and ſignified to <hi>France,</hi> all Arts
that could be were on that ſide employed to elude it by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Matter into a Treaty, or into greater length, which
had ſucceeded ſo well in <hi>England,</hi> that they offered to treat
upon it at <hi>St. Quintin</hi>'s, then at <hi>Gaunt;</hi> but the <hi>States</hi> were
firm, not to recede from their late Treaty made with the King,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:60932:269"/>
and ſo continued till about Five Days before the Term was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
                  <p>You heard before how the King had ſolicited <hi>Van Lewen</hi> to
accompany Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> to aſſure and perſwade the <hi>States</hi>
to purſue the Meaſures Sir <hi>William</hi> and he went upon to their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt:
but alas, now when Sir <hi>William,</hi> as well as the Prince, were
out of Sight, they were out of Mind too; and now Sir <hi>William</hi>
was gone, he forgot the Indignation which <hi>Barillon</hi> had put upon
him in the Treaty for the <hi>French</hi> Money he was to receive for join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the <hi>French</hi> Terms with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> which he then ſaid he
would never forget ſo long as he lived. But now you ſhall ſee how
abſolute a Dominion the <hi>French</hi> King had over him, and by what
Inſtruments he governed him, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Man, a <hi>French</hi> Woman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and a <hi>French</hi> Monk, who had changed his Frock for a Petticoat:
The <hi>French</hi> Man was <hi>Barillon,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Woman was the Dutcheſs
of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Monk was one <hi>Du Croſs:</hi> Theſe
three met the King in the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth</hi>'s Chamber, and
in one hour's time agreed, that <hi>Du Croſs</hi> ſhould carry Sir <hi>William
Temple</hi> a Pacquet, wherein the King commanded him to go im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and there endeavour all he could to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Ambaſſadors, as from the King, to let the
<hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors there know, That they would, for the Good
of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> conſent, and even deſire the <hi>French</hi> King no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to defer the Evacuation of the Towns, and conſequently the
Peace, upon the ſole Regard and Intereſt of the Crown of <hi>Sweden;</hi>
and Sir <hi>William</hi> was likewiſe commanded to aſſure the ſaid Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,
that after the Peace his Majeſty would uſe all the moſt
effectual Means he could for the Reſtitution of the Towns and
Countries the <hi>Swede</hi> had loſt in the War. This was to get Sir
<hi>William</hi> out of the way, who ſpirited the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the Action,
that <hi>Du Croſs</hi> might play his Pranks in the reſt.</p>
                  <p>But before <hi>Du Croſs</hi> had brought his Pacquet to Sir <hi>William,</hi> he
had gone about moſt induſtriouſly to the Deputies of the ſeveral
Towns, and acquainted them with it, and that the Terms of Peace
were abſolutely agreed upon between the two Kings: That he had
brought Sir <hi>William</hi> Orders ſtraight to get to <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and that
upon his Arrival there he ſhould meet with Letters from my Lord
of <hi>Sunderland</hi> (the King's Ambaſſador at <hi>Paris)</hi> with all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
concluded between them.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> followed his Inſtructions, and when he came to
<hi>Nimeguen</hi> there were but three Days of the Term fixed by the late
Treaty between the King and <hi>States</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> either for the
<hi>French</hi> Aſſent to the Evacuation of the Towns, or for carrying on
the War in Conjunction of <hi>Holland</hi> with <hi>England,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the reſt of the Confederates, but there found no Letters
from my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> of the Particulars of the Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:60932:269"/>
between the two Kings; but on the contrary a <hi>Manifeſto</hi>
to the <hi>Dutch</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, why their Maſter could
not conſent to it, without the previous Satisfaction of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
whoſe Intereſt he eſteemed the ſame with his own; but yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
he was willing to receive any Expedients the <hi>States</hi> ſhould
offer in this matter either by their Ambaſſadors at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> or
ſuch as the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould ſend his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty at <hi>St.
Quintin</hi> or <hi>Gaunt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors gave an Anſwer in writing, declaring it
was a Matter no longer entire, ſince upon the Difficulty raiſed
about the Evacuation of the Towns, the <hi>States</hi> their Maſters had
been induced to ſign a Treaty with <hi>England,</hi> from which they
could not recede, nor from the Day therein fixed for the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Fate of War or Peace; and as there was no Time, ſo
there could be no Deputation to <hi>St. Quintin</hi> or <hi>Gaunt,</hi> nor any
other Expedient beſides the Conſent of <hi>France</hi> to evacuate the

                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors having blown off his Chaff, the <hi>French</hi>
Ambaſſador then declared to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that they found the King
their Maſter was reſolved at the Deſire of the <hi>Swedes</hi> to retard
the Peace no longer upon their Conſideration, and would conſent
to evacuate the Towns, upon Condition the <hi>States</hi> would ſend
their Deputies to treat upon the Ways of ſecuring the future
Satisfaction to <hi>Sweden,</hi> which was by both intended: But the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Ambaſſadors continued peremptory, there could be no Deputation
made by their Maſters; and if the Term fixed by the late Treaty
with <hi>England</hi> ſhould elapſe, there was no remedy but that the
War muſt go on: to which the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors replied, <hi>That
their Hands were bound up from further proceeding without ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt the <hi>French</hi> were thus wheedling with the <hi>Dutch</hi> to elude
the Term fixed for the <hi>French</hi> evacuating the Towns, at the ſame
time <hi>Luxemburg</hi> preſſed <hi>Mons,</hi> and <hi>Schomberg</hi> ſeemed to threaten
<hi>Cologn;</hi> when the fatal Day came, whether a ſudden Peace or long
War were to be reckoned upon in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> when <hi>Boreel</hi> came
early that Morning from <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors at
<hi>Nimeguen,</hi> which were <hi>Beverning</hi> and one <hi>Haren;</hi> and then <hi>Boreel</hi>
went to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, and after ſome Conference with
them, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors and <hi>Boreel</hi> went immediately to
thoſe of <hi>Holland,</hi> and declared to them that they had received Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to conſent to the Evacuation of the Towns, and thereupon to
ſign the Peace; and that very Day at Night, tho late, <hi>Beverning</hi>
ſigned a Treaty of Peace and Commerce, Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> and
Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins</hi> refuſing to join in it, and the Confederates ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming

                     <pb n="528" facs="tcp:60932:270"/>
The next day after this Peace was thus ſigned, came an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
to Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> from our Court, with the Ratification<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
of the late Treaty between the King and <hi>States,</hi> with Orders im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to proceed to the Exchange of them; whereupon St.
<hi>William</hi> went from <hi>Nimeguen</hi> to the <hi>Hague,</hi> and the next Day after
his Arrival made an Exchange of the Ratifications.</p>
                  <p>Now was <hi>Holland</hi> in as much Diſorder as the Confederates
were at <hi>Nimeguen;</hi> the Penſioner and ſeveral of the Deputies were
as much diſſatisfied with <hi>Beverning</hi>'s Peace, as the Confederates
were, and ſaid he could not ſign the Peace before he had acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>States</hi> with it, and received new Orders there upon it; and
talked of calling him into Queſtion for it, and of diſavowing
what he had done, and thereupon of having recourſe to the Treaty
made with the King, which they now ratified.</p>
                  <p>But the Deputies of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> with whom others joined, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
their Satisfaction of the Concluſion of the Peace made by
<hi>Beverning,</hi> and argued the Weakneſs of their Confederates, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>Spain;</hi> and the Unſteadineſs, and Irreſolution of <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
had made the Peace abſolutely neceſſary to <hi>Holland:</hi> But however,
this Confuſion, and indeed the Fate of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> were the
Conſequences of <hi>Du Croſs</hi>'s Pacquet, and his acquainting the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
with a Peace made between the two Kings; yet how diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
ſoever this was to the King, he was not at all concerned
at it that I can find; but pleaſantly told Sir <hi>William Temple, Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the Rogue</hi> Du Croſs <hi>had outwitted them all.</hi> Could this be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
if the great Authority of Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> had not ſaid
it?</p>
                  <p>During theſe Brawls, both at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and all <hi>Holland</hi> over,
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> upon the Fourteenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> ſtormed
<hi>Luxemburg</hi>'s Camp before <hi>Mons,</hi> wherein the brave Duke of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
and the noble Earl of <hi>Oſſery</hi> were Partakers in the Glory
of it: and notwithſtanding the <hi>French Poſts</hi> were fortified with all
imaginable Art, and that the Prince's Army had undergone the
Fatigue of a hard March, attack'd them with a Reſolution and
Vigour that at firſt ſurprized them, and after an obſtinate-Fight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſo diſordered them, that though the Night prevented the further
Proſecution of the Action, yet it was generally concluded, That if
the Prince had been at Liberty next Day to have purſued the Action
with ſeven or eight Thouſand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who were ready to have
joined him, he might in all Appearance, not only have relieved
<hi>Mons,</hi> but have made ſuch an Impreſſion into <hi>France,</hi> as had been
often deſigned, but could not be done before: And I dare ſay,
if <hi>Luxemburg</hi> had had the like Advantage over the Prince, the
<hi>Dutch</hi> would have heard further of it; but the Prince was bound
up by a limited Authority, and ſo could not purſue the Advantage
he had acquired againſt the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>

The Succeſs of the Battel at <hi>Mons,</hi> though the Prince's Army
were withdrawn, gave new Life to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and Confederates,
that the War would go on according to the Ratification of the
Treaty at the <hi>Hague,</hi> exchanged the Day before the Fight, by Sir
<hi>William Temple</hi> and the <hi>States,</hi> whereas <hi>Beverning</hi>'s Peace at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meguen</hi>
was concluded without the <hi>States;</hi> beſides, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces
arrived daily in <hi>Flanders,</hi> as if the King were now reſolved to join
with the <hi>Dutch</hi> in carrying on the War purſuant to the League;
which made the Confederates as well as the <hi>Spainards</hi> refuſe to agree
to <hi>Beverning</hi>'s Peace.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, neither the <hi>French</hi> Pretenſions to the County of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
and the Town of <hi>Bovignes,</hi> nor in what Plight the ſix Towns
ſhould be delivered up, whether demoliſhed, or in the Plight they
then ſtood, nor the Dependences upon the Six Towns were adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Beverning</hi>'s Peace: But this Hope of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
ſhall coſt them dear, and only ſerve to advance the
<hi>French</hi> Terms, and intolerable Ravages of the <hi>French</hi> upon them.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>French</hi> cared little for the Confederates in Disjunction
with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and as little for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> when he had obtained
his Ends upon the Confederates; and therefore the <hi>French</hi> fall to
their wheedling Trade again with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King ſent
a Courier to <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> to ſatisfy the <hi>States</hi> in thoſe Clauſes of the
Treaty, wherein they ſeemed juſtly to except againſt <hi>Beverning</hi>'s
Conduct, thereby to cover the Credit of that Miniſter who had
been ſo affectionate an Inſtrument in the Progreſs of the Treaty;
and gave them (the <hi>States</hi>) Liberty a little to ſoften the Rigour
the <hi>French</hi> had as yet exerciſed in the ſmalleſt Points conteſted
with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and at laſt diſpatched an Expreſs to the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Ambaſſadors, with Power to remit all the Differences which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
or retarded the Concluſion of the Treaty between <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Spain,</hi> to the Determination of the <hi>States</hi> themſelves.</p>
                  <p>This Bait theſe Gudgeons ſwallowed as if no Hook had been in
it; ſo that ſeveral Towns and Provinces proceeded with a General
Concurrence to the Ratifications of the Peace, that they might lie
ready in their Ambaſſadors Hands to be exchanged, when that of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s ſhould be ſigned; and ſo diligent was <hi>Beverning</hi> in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the <hi>French</hi> Deſigns, now they were thus entertained in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that they huddled up the Treaty between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
and by the twentieth of <hi>September,</hi> the Ratifications of it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
with the uſual Forms, and now the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors
are become Mediators of (or Conſpirators in) this Treaty, whilſt
Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> the King's Mediator, only ſtood ſtill looking on
and having no Hand in it; and all the Ambaſſadors of the other
Allies, as well as the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> enraged and exclaiming againſt it.</p>
                  <p>During this Conſpiracy, the <hi>French</hi> Troops made Incurſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the rich Parts of <hi>Flanders,</hi> which had been covered in the time
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:60932:271"/>
of the War; and there exacted ſo great Contributions, and
made ſuch Ravages where they were diſputed, that the <hi>Spaniſh
Netherlands</hi> were more ruined between the ſigning of the Peace,
and the Exchange of the Ratifications, than they had been in
ſo much time during the whole Courſe of the War. At laſt the
Outcries and Calamities of the poor <hi>Flemins</hi> moved the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
out of their ſlow Pace, ſo that they were forced to accept of
the Terms the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> would give them.</p>
                  <p>And now the <hi>Dutch</hi> had done the <hi>French</hi> Work with <hi>Spain,</hi>
the will do the reſt without the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and piece-meal made
the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the Emperour and King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and
all the Princes of the Empire ſubmit to ſuch Terms as the
<hi>French</hi> pleaſed: The Particulars and manner of it, you may read
in the ſecond part of Sir <hi>William Temple</hi>'s Memoirs, which are
printed.</p>
                  <p>And now the <hi>French</hi> King had by the Help of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> made
his Market by the Peace at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> let's ſee how he improved
it after: The <hi>French</hi> King ſets up a Court of Claims in <hi>Alſatia</hi>
and <hi>Flanders,</hi> to determine the Dependences upon thoſe Towns,
which he kept by the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> both in <hi>Flanders</hi> and
<hi>Alſatia,</hi> where he is ſole Judg, and executes his Judgments by
Military Execution: It's ſcarce credible the Ravages he made
hereby, and what Titles he ſet up: I'll give but one Inſtance
herein, mentioned by Sir <hi>William Temple, p.</hi> 370. The Town of
<hi>Tournay</hi> was to have been given up to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> by the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made between our King and the Prince; this was left out
in the <hi>French</hi> Terms accepted by the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and <hi>Aeth</hi> was to be
one of the ſix Towns to be delivered up to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> by the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Terms with the <hi>French;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> had diſmembred
above ſixty Towns which were dependent upon <hi>Aeth,</hi> and added
them to the <hi>Chatellence,</hi> or Bailywick of <hi>Tournay;</hi> and were
thus belonging to <hi>Aeth,</hi> when the <hi>Spaniard</hi> transferred <hi>Aeth</hi> to
the <hi>French</hi> by the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapelle:</hi> but now <hi>Aeth</hi> muſt
be reſtored to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the Condition they left it, and not
what they found it: So that by theſe Acquiſitions which the <hi>French</hi>
got by this Treacherous Peace, he got more in Conſequence,
than by the War.</p>

                  <p>WHen the Parliament had given the King 1200000 <hi>l.</hi> for
carrying on an actual War againſt <hi>France</hi> in <hi>January</hi>
laſt, the Popiſh Plot was then in <hi>Embrio,</hi> and the Parliament were
ſo mortified by the Anſwer which the King made to them upon
the twenty eighth of <hi>May</hi> before, for adviſing him to enter into a
League with the <hi>States General</hi> of the <hi>

the Growth and Power of the <hi>French</hi> King, and Preſervation of

1200000 <hi>l.</hi> for carrying on the War againſt <hi>France,</hi> upon the
League which he had made at the <hi>Hague,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Thyn,</hi> though Sir
<hi>William Temple</hi> refuſed to have any Hand in it, as is ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>The Commons in Parliament for the firſt ten Years of this
Reign were <hi>Tories,</hi> and all their Buſineſs was againſt the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>
Diſſenters from the Church, ſcarce taking notice of the
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> till the Breach of the Triple Alliance; the ſecond Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> the ſecond Indulgence for Liberty of
Conſcience; the Attempt upon the <hi>Smirna</hi> Fleet; the ſhutting
up of the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> and the King's making War upon the <hi>Dutch</hi>
in Conjunction with the <hi>French:</hi> theſe thus ſucceſſively acted, opened
the Eyes of the greater part of the Commons, that for their own
and the Nation's Safety, they became more numerous in the Houſe
than the <hi>Tory</hi> Party; yet retained their Loyalty to the King, I verily
believe, as firm as any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men before them.</p>
                  <p>But out of the Houſe the Feuds of the <hi>Tories</hi> and <hi>Whigs</hi> were
as invenomed, as thoſe between the <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibelines,</hi> which
for three hundred Years involved <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> in inteſtine
Wars: The <hi>Tories</hi> cry'd up the Court, and the Court countenanced
them; and the <hi>Tories</hi> having the Dominion of the Preſs, printed
all Sorts of Irritating Libels againſt the <hi>Whigs,</hi> and if the <hi>Whigs</hi>
anſwered, they were proſecuted for printing <hi>Illicite;</hi> when the
<hi>Tories</hi> could make no other Reply, but that the <hi>Whigs</hi> were run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
back to 1641.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tories</hi> had got a new invented Doctrine of inconſiſtible
Terms, called, <hi>Paſſive Obedience:</hi> I would willingly be informed
in the Grammatical Conſtruction of theſe two Words, how a Noun
Adjective or Participle, can alter the Signification of a Noun Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantive;
for if any one be ſubject to another, and be commanded
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:60932:272"/>
or forbidden by this other, it is Diſobedience if he does not
the Command of this other: How therefore Paſſive joined to
Diſobedience, can make it Obedience, had need of a better
Interpretation than what the <hi>Tories</hi> give; which is, if you cannot
obey, you muſt ſuffer: But this is another Propoſition; and ſo
Diſobedience here is Diſobedience ſtill; and the true Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> is Diſobedience, and be hang'd for it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tories</hi> and <hi>Whigs</hi> in theſe Feuds, were apt to take Fire and

                     </gap>ry, which was blazed
by the <hi>Tories,</hi> That there was a Deſign by the <hi>Whigs</hi> of killing the
King: but it happened, Mr. <hi>Hawles</hi> ſays in <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Trial,
<hi>f.</hi> 3. to be in ſuch a Place and Manner, as afterwards <hi>Oates</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> intended to have done it.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon Mr. <hi>Cleypole (Oliver</hi>'s Son-in-law) was impriſoned in
the Tower, (the Place you'll ſee, where the Papiſts acted all their
Deſigns) for deſigning to kill the King; and in <hi>Trinity Term</hi> 1678,
Mr. <hi>Cleypole</hi> had an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> and was
brought up in order to be bailed, and produced Perſons of Worth to
bail him; but the Penalty of the Bail ſet by the Court was ſo high
that the Bail refuſed to ſtand, and Mr. <hi>Cleypole</hi> was remanded to the
Tower: But the Term after, when the Matter of which he was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
appeared to be the Deſign of other People, he was let go, for
fear the Examination of it ſhould go further in proving the <hi>Popiſh
Plot</hi> than any thing at that time diſcovered; and therefore no further
Inquiry was made on whoſe, or on what Evidence he was committed.</p>
                  <p>The firſt who gave Light to the <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> was <hi>Titus Oates,</hi>
which if it had depended upon his ſingle Teſtimony, had not like
to have gone any further, the Court and <hi>Tories</hi> being ſo induſtrious
to ridicule it, if ſome other Accidents ſhould not make <hi>Oates</hi>'s
Teſtimony more credible: <hi>Oates</hi> therefore refers himſelf to <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s
Papers, where the whole Deſign would appear to have been
carried on for the laſt five Years.</p>
                  <p>The Court could not but inquire into the Truth of this, but
proceeded ſo ſlowly in it, that <hi>Coleman</hi> had time enough to convey
away all the Papers of his laſt 2 Years, with his Book of Entries
of them, tho his Servant <hi>Boatman</hi> upon his Examination depoſed,
he ſaw <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Book of Entries but two Days before <hi>Coleman</hi> was
made Priſoner, and that had uſually Letters every Poſt from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Sea: However the Letters which were found, amazed the
greater Part of the Council.</p>
                  <p>But tho theſe Letters began this Plot in the Year 1673, yet it is
evident by the Teſtimony of <hi>Florence Wyer,</hi> who was a Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:60932:272"/>
that a Popiſh Plot was carried on in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the Year
1665 and 1666, and brought to Maturity in the Year 1667. For
Col. <hi>Kelly</hi> and Col. <hi>Bourn</hi> were ſent into <hi>Ireland</hi> from the <hi>French</hi>
King, with a Commiſſion to muſter as many Men as they could,
the <hi>French</hi> King promiſing to ſend an Army of Forty Thouſand
Men, to eſtabliſh the Roman Catholick Religion, upon St. <hi>Lewis</hi>'s
Day in <hi>Auguſt:</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> King, as before noted, had other
Deſigns in his Head, and at that time was engaged to make good
the Dauphin's Title to <hi>Brabant</hi> and the other <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Territories,
and ſo kept his Word no better with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> than he had done
his Faith in the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty: the <hi>Iriſh</hi> hereupon complained
to the Cardinal of <hi>Bovillon,</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> King's Breach of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to them, and that he ſhould turn his Army againſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
King, and not redeem <hi>Ireland</hi> from its Heretical Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
which you may read at large in <hi>Plunket</hi>'s Trial, and how it
was carried on till the Diſcovery of that in <hi>England;</hi> and all this
proved by Roman Catholicks.</p>
                  <p>If thoſe Counſellors which were not engaged in the Popiſh
Plot were amazed at this Diſcovery of <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters, thoſe
who were ingaged in it were not leſs ſurprized; and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being to meet ſome few Days after, I think the <hi>1ſt</hi> of
<hi>October;</hi> the King hereupon, as aforementioned, took Counſel
whether he might not prorogue it to a further Day; and 'twas
ſaid Chancellour <hi>Finch</hi> was of Opinion he might, whereupon Mr.
<hi>Seymour</hi> (now Sir <hi>Edward)</hi> then Speaker of the Commons, went
out of Town: but upon Advice of <hi>John Brown</hi> Clerk of the
Parliament, that ſo many Members of both Houſes muſt meet
and ſit when a Prorogation was made, Mr. <hi>Seymour</hi> was recalled,
and the Houſes met, and were prorogued accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Between this Prorogation and the meeting of the Parliament,
Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> was murdered <hi>Oct.</hi> 12. and if the Council
were amazed at <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters, the whole Nation was not leſs
at the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmund,</hi> and the time ſet for the meeting
of the Parliament being about 9 or 10 Days after, the Court
thought not fit to make another Prorogation, to take new Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
upon the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here I think fit to relate one Story concerning the Murder of
Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> which I find no where in Print, and the
rather for that Sir <hi>R. S.</hi> ſo ridicules <hi>Prance</hi>'s Evidence, becauſe
he recanted before the King in his Cloſet all that he had been
examined and ſwore to about Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey</hi>'s Murder, which
he again recanted after he came to Priſon; a <hi>Papiſt</hi> he was, and
by Profeſſion a Silver-Smith, and wrought for the Prieſts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> and was aſſiſting at the Murder of Sir
<hi>Edm. Godfrey,</hi> and alſo at the carrying the Body out of <hi>Somerſet-houſe;</hi>
and ſometime after the Murder of Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:60932:273"/>
ſome of <hi>Prance</hi>'s Neighbours having obſerved that <hi>Prance</hi>
did not come to his Houſe for ſeveral days, they repreſented it to
ſome Members of the Houſe of Commons, that they had a great
Suſpicion that <hi>Prance</hi> had a Hand in the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmund;</hi>
and thereupon they got an Order to ſeize <hi>Prance,</hi> and bring him
before the Houſe, which they did, and the Houſe ordered Sir
<hi>Rich. Everard</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Harboard</hi> to examine him.</p>
                  <p>Before the Murder, <hi>Le Faire, Pritchard</hi> and other Prieſts treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Bedlow,</hi> to be aſſiſting in the Murder of Sir <hi>Edm.</hi> but
<hi>Bedlow,</hi> tho he promiſed it, relented, and did not come; but the
<hi>Monday</hi> after the Murder, <hi>viz. Oct.</hi> 14. he met <hi>Le Faire</hi> in <hi>Red-Lyon
Court,</hi> who charged him with not keeping his Word, but
charged <hi>Bedlow</hi> to meet him at 9 a Clock in <hi>Somerſet-houſe,</hi> and
there told <hi>Bedlow</hi> that tho he was not aſſiſting as he promiſed in
the killing of Sir <hi>Edm.</hi> yet if he would be aſſiſting in the carrying
him off, he ſhold have 2000 <hi>l. Bedlow</hi> then deſired <hi>Le Faire,</hi> if
he might not ſee the Body, who told him, yes; which <hi>Bedlow</hi> did,
and then they adviſed about the Diſpoſal of it, and <hi>Bedlow</hi> adviſed
the ſinking the Body in the River with Weights, which was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to; thus far <hi>Bedlow</hi> depoſes: but in ſeeing the body, <hi>Bedlow</hi>
ſaw <hi>Prance</hi> there in the Company too, but did not know him before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bedlow</hi> ſays, he was troubled in Conſcience, having twice taken
the Sacrament to conceal the Buſineſs, and went to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> where
God put it into his Heart, that ſome Murders were paſt, and
greater to come, for Prevention whereof he was convinced it was
his Duty to come to <hi>London</hi> to reveal this Wickedneſs, which he
did, and came into the Lobby of the Houſe of Lords to make a
Diſcovery, where I then ſaw him.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time Sir <hi>Charles Harboard</hi> and Sir <hi>Rich. Everard</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
examined <hi>Prance,</hi> and the Houſe being ſet, left <hi>Prance</hi> to the
Care of the Conſtable of <hi>Covent-Garden;</hi> who brought him into the
Lobby of the Houſe of Lords, where <hi>Bedlow</hi> ſeeing him, but never
before he ſaw him in <hi>Somerſet-houſe, Bedlow</hi> charged the Guards to
ſeize him, for that he was one of thoſe he ſaw at <hi>Somerſet-houſe,</hi>
where the Body of Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey</hi> lay: and by the ſame token he
had then a black Peruke, but now none; hereupon Search being
made, the Peruke was found. Here I make a twofold Remark, one of
the Strangeneſs of the Diſcovery of <hi>Prance</hi> by <hi>Bedlow</hi> who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
but once ſeen <hi>Prance</hi> before, and that by Candle-light, and in
a Peruke, ſhould yet upon the firſt Sight of him know him again
without Peruke; the other, is the Clearneſs of Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey</hi>'s
being murdered, and the Body's being in <hi>Somerſet-houſe,</hi> upon <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
after the Murder the <hi>Saturday</hi> before; and from hence it was
that <hi>Prance</hi> became an Evidence in this Diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>Now let's ſee how things ſtood upon the Meeting of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the <hi>21ſt</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1678, both abroad and at home.
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:60932:273"/>
And herein both Houſes were as warm in Enquiry into them, as
the Court was cold.</p>
                  <p>It was but in <hi>January</hi> before, that the Parliament had given the
King 1200000 <hi>l.</hi> for carrying on a War againſt <hi>France,</hi> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and their Allies: and upon their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they found a treacherous ſeparate Peace made by a Faction
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> with the <hi>French,</hi> and upon <hi>French</hi> Terms, wherein
the King had taken Money of the <hi>French</hi> to join with this <hi>Dutch</hi>
Faction in it. Beſides the King's Guards, which he might encreaſe
as he pleaſed, as well as keep up thoſe he had, there was now
another Army raiſed, which now it was of no further Uſe abroad,
they dreaded as much as they did the <hi>French</hi> Arms now he had
ſubdued the Confederates, by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Disjunction from them;
and the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot carried on at home, whilſt
theſe things were thus agitated abroad, was to them a Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the ſame Councils which governed abroad did ſo at home.</p>
                  <p>And if the Parliament were thus amazed at their Sitting, it was
no way leſſened when as they found that in this very Month no
leſs than 57 Commiſſions were diſcovered for raiſing Soldiers,
granted to ſeveral Romiſh Recuſants, with Warrants to muſter
without taking the <hi>Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy</hi> and the <hi>Test,</hi>
counterſigned by Sir <hi>J. W.</hi> Secretary of State; whereupon, the
Commons committed him to the <hi>Tower;</hi> yet the King next Day
diſcharged him, with a Reprimand to the Commons: but upon
the Commons Addreſs to the King about it, the King, as before
in his Declarations of Indulgence, promiſed to recal them.</p>
                  <p>However, the Commons appointed a ſecret Committee to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
to the Bottom of the Popiſh Plot; who having made ſome
Progreſs in it, upon <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>1st</hi> of <hi>November</hi> came to this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
<hi>Nemine contradicente, That upon the Evidence that has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
appeared to this Houſe, this Houſe is of Opinion, That there hath
been, and ſtill is, a damnable helliſh Plot, contrived and carried on by
Popiſh Recuſants, for aſſaſſinating and murdering the King, ſubverting
the Government, and rooting out and deſtroying the Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
Which being the ſame Day communicated to the Lords, they una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
and readily concurred with the Commons in it; and
upon the <hi>5th,</hi> the Commons impeached the Earl of <hi>Powis,</hi> the
Viſcount <hi>Stafford,</hi> and the Lords <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Warder, Petre,</hi> and
<hi>Bellaſis,</hi> of High Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>The Commons having proceeded thus far in ſearching into the
Popiſh Plot, upon the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> proceeded in their next
Fear of the Army raiſed, and now indeed in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where the
<hi>French</hi> Army raged, after the <hi>Dutch</hi> had made their ſeparate Peace,
without Oppoſition, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army only a Burden to the
Country, and of no Uſe to reſtrain the <hi>French</hi> Ravages; and
Voted,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="536" facs="tcp:60932:274"/>
1. That it is neceſſary, for the Safety of his Majeſty's Perſon,
and preſerving the Peace of the Government, That all the Forces
which have been raiſed ſince the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1677, and all
others which have been ſince that time brought over from beyond
Seas from foreign Service, be forthwith disbanded.</p>
                  <p>2. It is the humble Opinion of this Houſe, That the Forces
which are now in <hi>Flanders</hi> may be immediately called over, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to their disbanding.</p>
                  <p>3. That the Houſe would to Morrow Morning reſolve it ſelf
into a Committee of the whole Houſe, to conſider the Manner of
disbanding the Army.</p>
                  <p>The five Popiſh Lords had been impeached by the Commons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a Fortnight, and no Articles exhibited againſt them, when
the King gave the Commons an Account, that he had given Order
for ſeizing Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi>'s Papers, upon Information that he had
held ſeveral Correſpondences, whilſt he was Ambaſſador in <hi>France,</hi>
with the Pope's Nuncio, without any Direction or Order of his
Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> the ſame Day, produced two Letters from
my Lord Treaſurer, whilſt he was Ambaſſador in <hi>France,</hi> which
being read, the Houſe reſolved to impeach the Treaſurer, and the
ſame Day ordered a Committee to draw up Articles againſt him;
which on <hi>Saturday</hi> the Committee did, and on <hi>Monday</hi> following
impeached the Treaſurer upon them: whereas the Commons had
not yet exhibited any againſt the Popiſh Lords. This was upon
the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>December.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the Treaſurer was conſtant to himſelf, I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
how the Commons Impeachment of him in the <hi>4th</hi> Article
could conſiſt with the King's Diſpleaſure againſt him for the quite
contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſuppreſſed the Evidences, and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
diſcountenanced the King's Witneſſes in Diſcovery of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Plot: And Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> ſays, pag. 391. <hi>That the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
was fallen into the King's Diſpleaſure for bringing the Popiſh Plot
into Parliament against the King's abſolute Command.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, the Parliament granted the King 693388 <hi>l.</hi> to disband
the Army, and alſo an Additional Duty upon Wines for 3 Years:
but no more Money being like to come this Seſſions, upon <hi>Monday</hi>
the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> he prorogued the Parliament to the <hi>4th</hi> of
<hi>February</hi> next, and then told them, <hi>That it was with great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs
that he was come to tell them that he intended to prorogue
them; that all of them were Witneſſes he had not been well uſed, the
Particulars of which he would acquaint them with at a more ſeaſonable
time,</hi> (but when will that be? for he never ſaw them after:) <hi>In
the mean time, he would immediately enter upon the disbanding the
Army, and do what Good he could for the Kingdom, and Safety of
Religion, and that he would proſecute the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot,
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:60932:274"/>
to find out the Inſtruments of it, and take all the Care that is in his
Power to ſecure the Proteſtant Religion as it is now eſtabliſhed.</hi> How
well this was performed you'll ſoon ſee; and before the <hi>4th</hi> of
<hi>February</hi> he diſſolved this Eighteen-year-old Parliament. The
Vogue went, It was upon the Account of my Lord Treaſurer,
tho I believe, upon ſeverer Thoughts, it will ſeem rather to have
been done upon the Account of the Popiſh Lords and Popiſh Plot.
Theſe Feuds in the Nation, and Jealouſies between the King and
Parliament, ſtifled the Apprehenſions of the dreadful growing
Power of the <hi>French</hi> King, and made fair Weather for him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
his boundleſs Ambition, without any Regard of his Faith
or Honour, where-ever he could extend it.</p>
                  <p>Never did one Parliament ſucceed another ſo early as the next
did this long Parliament; for the King, by his Proclamation, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
the Long Parliament upon the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> and the
ſame Day iſſued out Writs for a new one to meet at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> following; which was juſt 40 Days between the
Teſt and Return.</p>
                  <p>In this Interval, the Blaze of the Parliament's Vote of their
Apprehenſions of <hi>a damnable and helliſh Popiſh Plot</hi> had taken
deep Impreſſions in the Minds of Men in general; and the <hi>Whigs</hi>
taking Advantage of it, in this ſhort Interval run down the <hi>Tories</hi>
without Oppoſition: nay, even the King himſelf apprehended
there could be no Hopes of attaining his Ends in the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but by ſeeming zealous in the proſecuting the Diſcovery of
the Popiſh Plot, and that he would not longer be governed by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
and ſingle Councils.</p>
                  <p>There had been ſeveral Debates in the Houſe of Commons, of
the dangerous Conſequences in reference to the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s
Succeſſion to the Crown, and that the Bottom of the Popiſh Plot
centred in the Duke's being a Papiſt, and the preſumptive Heir to
the Crown; but I do not find they came to any Vote upon it,
yet reſolved upon the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> to make an Addreſs to the
King, That the Duke might withdraw himſelf from his Perſon and
Councils; and in Conformity therewith, the Duke went, or was
ſent into <hi>Holland:</hi> and upon the meeting of the Parliament, the
King acquainted them how great things he had already done for
the preventing the Progreſs of the Popiſh Plot; as the Excluſion
of the Popiſh Lords from their Seats in Parliament, and the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of ſeveral Men upon the Score of the Plot, as well as the
Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey;</hi> but above all, that he had
commanded his Brother from him, becauſe he would not leave
malicious Men room to ſay, he had not removed all Cauſes which
could be pretended to influence him toward Popiſh Counſels; and
tells, <hi>That as he had not been ſlack in putting the preſent Laws in
Execution against</hi> Papiſts, <hi>ſo he was ready to join in making ſuch fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                     <pb n="538" facs="tcp:60932:275"/>
Laws as may be neceſſary for the ſecuring the Kingdom againſt
Popery; <hi>and then demands a Supply, and concludes with his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to have this a healing Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Houſe choſe Mr. <hi>Seymour,</hi> the Speaker of the laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to be their Speaker in this, but the King rejected him,
which was no good Preſage of a healing Parliament; and ſo the
Commons choſe Mr. <hi>Serjeant Gregory,</hi> and the King accepted him.</p>
                  <p>The Commons began where the laſt Parliament left, in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Impeachments againſt the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> and the Popiſh
Lords in the <hi>Tower;</hi> but who ſhould be firſt tried, and what were
the Juriſdiction of the Biſhops Right of Voting in their Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and their Judgments in Caſes of Blood, run quite through
this Seſſions, wherein the Lords and Commons ſeldom agreed.
There were two things which made the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>'s Caſe more
favourably ſpoken of; one, That tho he was proſecuted ſeveral
Weeks after the Popiſh Lords were committed, yet the Commons
would not proceed in their Impeachments againſt the Popiſh Lords
before the Lords had given their Judgments upon the Earl's Plea;
The other was a Vote of the Commons upon the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>May, That
no Commoner whatſoever ſhould preſume to maintain the Validity of the
Earl of</hi> Danby'<hi>s Pardon without Leave of the Houſe firſt obtained, and
that the Perſons ſo doing ſhall be accounted Betrayers of</hi> England:
and there was no Nobleman a profeſt Lawyer; ſo that tho the
Earl's Plea upon his Pardon was Matter of Law, yet no Commoner
muſt preſume to plead his Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The King, beſides his ſending the Duke of <hi>York</hi> beyond Sea,
that the World might now ſee how otherways he was become a
new Man for the future, upon the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1679 made this
Declaration in Council, and in Parliament, and after publiſh'd it
to the whole Nation, how ſenſible he was of the ill Poſture of his
Affairs, and the great Diſſatisfaction and Jealouſies of his good
Subjects, whereby the Crown and Government were become too
weak to preſerve it ſelf, which proceeded from his uſe of a ſingle
Miniſtry, and of private Advices; and therefore profeſſed his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to lay them aſide for the future, and be adviſed by thoſe
whom he had then choſen for his Council in all his weighty and
important Affairs, together with the frequent Advice of his great
Council in Parliament: and indeed in this Council were many
worthy Members; my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was Preſident of it,
and the then Sir <hi>Henry Capel,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> Members
of it.</p>
                  <p>But this Declaration of the King's, added to the ſending the
Duke of <hi>York</hi> into <hi>Holland,</hi> had not the King's deſired Effect; the
Commons, (beſides the Dread of the Popiſh Plot as well at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
but more in conſequence) after the King had declared he
would not alter the Succeſſion of the Crown in the right Line,
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:60932:275"/>
were no ways ſatisfied with the Disburſements of the Money, nor
the disbanding the Army, yet were reſolved it ſhould be done,
and voted another Sum of 26462 <hi>l.</hi> for it; but it was not carried
without ſome Difficulty, that theſe Monies ſhould be paid into the
<hi>Exchequer,</hi> but <hi>Chamber</hi> of <hi>London:</hi> however, the Commons car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
That the Money ſo raiſed ſhould be appropriated to that
Uſe, and to that End appointed Commiſſioners to disband the
new-rais'd Army, and ſo voted, <hi>That the Continuance of any ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Forces in this Nation, other than the</hi> Militia, <hi>to be illegal, and
a great Grievance and Vexation to the People,</hi> hereby meaning the
King's Guards. They alſo ordered a Bill to be brought in, for
annexing <hi>Tangier</hi> to the Imperial Crown of <hi>England;</hi> and voted,
<hi>That thoſe who did adviſe the King to part with</hi> Tangier <hi>to any fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Prince or State, or were inſtrumental therein, ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
Enemies to the King and Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But how jealous ſoever the Commons were of the King, yet
they conceived it was his Life which ſecured them from the
Fears they dreaded of the Duke's coming to the Crown; and
therefore upon the</hi> 11th <hi>of</hi> May <hi>voted,</hi> Nemine contradicente, That
in Defence of the King's Perſon and the Proteſtant Religion, this
Houſe does declare, that they will ſtand by his Majeſty with their
Lives and Fortunes; and that if his Majeſty ſhall come to an untimely
End (which God forbid) they will revenge it upon the Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems the Commons had more Care of the King than he had
of himſelf; for he not only countenanced the Plotters, but ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed
the Plot. In his Speech at the opening this Parliament, he
told them he had not been idle in diſcovering the Plot; and in the
laſt, he told Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> he was diſpleaſed with the Earl of
<hi>Danby</hi> for bringing the Popiſh Plot into Parliament, againſt his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Command. <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Profeſſions and Actions never appeared
ſo hypocritical and deceitful as this King's; and all this after the
Parliament had voted <hi>there was a helliſh Conſpiracy by the Papists
against his Life:</hi> and this proved by a Cloud of Witneſſes, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Manner and Circumſtances of it, as <hi>Oates, Bedlow,
Prance, Dangerfield, Bolron,</hi> and <hi>Mowbray,</hi> many of which had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſeen one the other before they gave their Teſtimonies.</p>
                  <p>Objection. <hi>Theſe were Witneſſes of ſuſpected Fame, therefore no
Credit ought to be given to them.</hi> But admit this were true, which
is not, for except <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> and while <hi>Prance</hi> was frighted with
Terror, there was no Objection againſt <hi>Oates, Bedlow, Mowbray,</hi>
and <hi>Bolron,</hi> it will admit of a twofold Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>1. Truth is one, and conſiſts in entire parts, whereas Error and
Falſhood is infinite; and therefore it had been impoſſible that
<hi>Mowbray</hi> and <hi>Bolron,</hi> who had never ſeen <hi>Oates</hi> or <hi>Bedlow</hi> before
they gave their Teſtimonies, and <hi>Bedlow</hi> who had never known
<hi>Mowbray, Bolron,</hi> nor <hi>Oates,</hi> ſhould concur not only in the Deſign
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:60932:276"/>
of killing the King, but in the Manner, Place, and Circumſtances
of it.</p>
                  <p>2. Admit theſe Mens Evidence might not have been credited
in other Caſes, yet it's fit to conſider Witneſſes in civil or cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
Caſes; in civil Caſes Men may make Elections of what
Witneſſes they pleaſe, and it is their Fault if they make not
uſe of Men of know Integrity and Repute, that more Credit
may be given to their Evidence: and the End of civil Actions and
Contracts is, that they may be known; but immoral and wicked
Actions are Deeds of Darkneſs, and contrived ſo as that they may
not be known; ſo that the Knowledg of them comes to paſs either
by Accident, or from the Conſpirators themſelves: as if only one
Man ſees a Murderer or a Thief kill or rob another, if his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
ſhall not be taken becauſe otherwiſe an ill Man, Multitudes
of Murders and Thefts might paſs unpuniſhed. So if <hi>Cicero,</hi> when
<hi>Fulvia</hi> firſt diſcovered <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Conſpiracy to him, had told her
ſhe was a Whore, and no Credit could be given to any thing ſhe
ſaid, <hi>Rome</hi> might have been in a Flame as <hi>London</hi> was, and all the
Senators Throats might have been cut.</p>
                  <p>But admit no Credit could be given to any or all theſe Mens
Teſtimonies, who were all <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> I would know what
Objection could be againſt Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> (a Gentleman of Birth and
Quality) who gave no Evidence at <hi>Ireland</hi>'s, <hi>Wakeman</hi>'s, <hi>Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

heard that <hi>Ireland,</hi> who was his Father Confeſſor, at his Death
denied that he was in Town, but in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> when <hi>Oates</hi> and
<hi>Grove</hi>'s Maid ſaid he was in <hi>London</hi> in <hi>August</hi> 1678, and printed
it, and the Reaſons of it; and alſo at my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Trial in
open Parliament depoſed, That <hi>Ireland</hi> told him there was but one
that ſtood in the way, and that it was an eaſy thing to poiſon the
King, and that Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> might eaſily and opportunely
do it; and that in <hi>August 1678, (when</hi> Ireland <hi>at his Death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
he was in</hi> Staffordſhire) <hi>Ireland</hi> told Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> in <hi>London,</hi>
when he was newly returned from <hi>Windſor,</hi> how eaſily the King
might be taken off, and asked Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> if he would be one of
them who ſhould go to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and aſſiſt at the taking off the
King, and proffered Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> to remit 200 <hi>l.</hi> which he owed
<hi>Ireland,</hi> if he would: Then <hi>Ireland</hi> asked if he knew any ſtout
<hi>Iriſh</hi>-men; who anſwer'd he knew Captain <hi>Levallian,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kerney,
Brohal</hi> and <hi>Wilſon. Ireland</hi> told him he knew <hi>Levallian</hi> and <hi>Wilſon;</hi>
and then <hi>Ireland</hi> asked him if he would go with them, and aſſiſt

Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> deſiring a new Commiſſion in the new rais'd Army,
his Brother told him he would procure him one from the Duke
of <hi>York,</hi> and that there was another Army to be raiſed, but this
was not to be till the King was taken off; and this I ſay, that
about this time there was a general Rumour of a Page being kill'd
upon a Couch in the Night at <hi>Windſor,</hi> where the King was laid
but a little before; and that the King, upon the Fright of it,
came next Morning to <hi>London;</hi> and that it was Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> who,
with much Importunity, got the King (having been drinking hard
before) from the Couch, and put him to Bed; and that the Page
who was killed aſleep upon the Couch, was wrap'd up in the Cloak
the King was in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Commons likewiſe reſolved</hi> Nemine contradicente, That the
Duke of <hi>York</hi> being a Papist, and the Hopes of his coming as ſuch to
the Crown, have given the greatest Countenance and Encouragement to
the preſent Conſpirators, and the Deſigns of the Papiſts against the
King and Proteſtant Religion.</p>
                  <p>But the Deſigns of the King was, how to get Money for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
a Fleet for our common Security now in time of ſuch a
Peace as the <hi>French</hi> King had granted <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> after the King
had taken his Money to join in it, and after he had taken the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament's
Money to enter into an actual War againſt <hi>France;</hi> and
after the Parliament had twice given Money for disbanding this
Army, which not ſucceeding, the Commons dreading how Monies
given at this time of Day might be employed, took no more
Care in it than the King did in the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot;
ſo he prorogued the Parliament upon the Twenty ſeventh of <hi>May</hi>

                  <p>This barbarous Act was a Prelude to what followed; for upon

                  <p>The other was,
<q>We the Officers of the Covenanted Army, do require and command the
Magiſtrates of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> to extend and baniſh forth thereof all Arch-biſhops,
Biſhops, and Curates, their Wives, Berns, Servants, and

                  </p>
                  <p>And then they publiſhed a long Declaration of their taking up
Arms for a free General Aſſembly, and free and unlimited Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to redreſs the manifold Grievances there enumerated, and
humbly to requeſt his Majeſty to reſtore all things as he found
them when God brought him home to his Crown and Kingdoms;
that was, <hi>to the Dominion the Rump-Parliament in</hi> England <hi>had over
them:</hi> which you may read at large in the aforeſaid Author, from
<hi>pag.</hi> 67 to 74.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="543" facs="tcp:60932:277"/>
To theſe Declarations the ſaid Author, <hi>p.</hi> 17. adds, they barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
treated the dead Body of one <hi>Graham,</hi> whom they had killed
at a Conventicle: They committed inſufferable Inſolencies in the
Houſes of the regular Miniſters and Loyal Gentlemen as they
marched along to <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> ſtabbing and gaſhing his Majeſty's Picture
where-ever they found it: They behaved themſelves barbarouſly
in the Houſe of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> where they burnt
his Books, cut in pieces his beſt Furniture and Hangings, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
kill'd a Gentlewoman with Blows who was left to keep the
Houſe, for ſaying, <hi>Gentlemen, I hope you'll remember you are in an
Arch-biſhop's Houſe.</hi> They ſacrilegiouſly entred the Cathedral of
<hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and finding a Tombſtone over two of the Children of
the Biſhop of <hi>Argile,</hi> with an Inſcription of a Modern Date, they
digged up their Bodies, run them through with their Swords, and
left them lying above Ground.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Council of <hi>Scotland</hi> were not idle, but
raiſed an Army, and quartered it at a place called <hi>Blackborn,</hi> to
prevent the Covenanters Approach to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and gave the
King an Account of theſe things, and expected his Majeſty's further
Orders: And now I'll tell a wonder which will ſcarce be believed in
future Generations. The King ſent the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> from
<hi>London</hi> upon the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> and the Duke rode above three
hundred Miles upon that day and the two next days, and upon
the <hi>23d</hi> ordered and diſpoſed the King's Army raiſed by the
Council, that he fought the Covenanters and routed them, killing
about ſeven hundred of them, and took above eleven hundred of
them Priſoners; and now it may be you will hear of a Wonder
in Conſequence after this Fight as great as the Fight, and the
Duke's Journey before it.</p>
                  <p>I do not queſtion but the Deſign of the Court in ſending the
Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> into <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſuppreſs the Covenanters, was
by it to make him odious to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and other Diſſenters
from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in caſe he ſuppreſſed the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which tho the Duke did, yet the End deſigned by the Court
in it did not ſucceed.</p>
                  <p>For the dreadful Apprehenſion of the Duke's Succeſſion to the
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> had taken a deep Impreſſion in another ſort of
Men beſides Diſſenters: and where Men are fearful of Danger,
they will ſeek all means how to prevent the Danger, eſpecially
where the Power of doing ill is greater; and therefore another
ſort of Men, no <hi>Whigs,</hi> might have their Eyes upon the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth,</hi> as the only means to prevent the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
to the Crown; his Title to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> if he
could get an Act of Parliament for it, being as good as that of
<hi>John,</hi> alias <hi>Robert Stuart,</hi> the Son of <hi>Elizabeth Moore,</hi> from whom
the King and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> were both deſcended, and in whoſe
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:60932:278"/>
Right they claimed the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> if not thoſe of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, this gave the Lie to the <hi>Tories,</hi> that all thoſe were
Commonwealths-Men who would not ſubmit to the Illegal and
Arbitrary Will of the King, and their Doctrine of Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
and that Kings, <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> may do what they liſt, tho
God has ſet Laws and Bounds to all the created Bodies of Heaven
and Earth, and all other Creatures in them. But how miſchievous
theſe Doctrines have proved to theſe three Kings of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi>
Nation has been already ſaid, and I ſay it has been ſuch flattering
Doctrines as thoſe that ruined all theſe Kings and Kingdoms (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the <hi>Gibeonites, Joſhua</hi> 9. the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> and that of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi>
for <hi>Du Salez</hi> was a juſt and vertuous Prince) from which
Commonwealths aroſe. Who ever, before King <hi>James</hi> and King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's Reign in <hi>England,</hi> heard of talking of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
in <hi>England,</hi> and the ſeveral ſorts of Governments, <hi>viz.</hi>
Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, Democracy, which two latter, tho they
have the ſame Names, yet no two of either in their Conſtitutions
were like one the other? And as theſe Commonwealths took their
Riſe from the Tyrannies of Kings and Princes; ſo the exploded
Government of the <hi>Rump,</hi> if it were a Democracy or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
gave Life to all thoſe Confuſions, Perjuries, Breach of
Leagues, and deviliſh Practices of this Reign, which would have
been intolerable in any other, and would have been oppoſed, if
not by riſing in Arms againſt them, yet at leaſt in not ſo profuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pouring out Money for not continuing and carrying of them
on.</p>
                  <p>The Popiſh Faction were more jealous of the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
than the <hi>Tories</hi> were of a Commonwealth, and the rather
becauſe there was a Pamphlet printed, that the King was married
to the Duke's Mother, and rumoured abroad that Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerrard</hi>
had a Black Box, in which the Marriage of the King with the Duke's
Mother was fully proved and made out; and the fear of the Duke
of <hi>York</hi>'s Succeſſion was ſo fix'd in Mens Minds, that the Story
of the Black Box was generally divulged, and for ought I know,
believed by thoſe who were fearful of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
                  <p>If this could be made out, the Popiſh Faction would loſe the
<hi>Tories</hi> and <hi>Paſſive-Obedience-Men,</hi> who at preſent were their <hi>deareſt
Joys,</hi> and without them they had not Means to carry on their
Deſign of propagating the Catholick Cauſe; they were ſure of the
King (tho it's believed he loved not the Duke of <hi>York)</hi> and
therefore the King made three Declarations, the firſt of the ſecond
of <hi>June</hi> 1679, wherein he calls the Report of his Marriage or
Contract with Mrs. <hi>Walters,</hi> alias <hi>Barrow,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>'s
Mother, falſe and ſcandalous; and upon the ſixth of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi>
                     <pb n="545" facs="tcp:60932:278"/>
following, declared, that they who ſhould ſay he was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
or contracted to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Mother, were neither
his nor the Duke's Friends, and declared in the Preſence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, that he was never married nor contracted to any other
Woman but his Wife Queen <hi>Catherine;</hi> and upon the third of
<hi>March</hi> following, declared in Council, and entred it into the Council-Books
in the Preſence of Almighty God, that he was never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
or married to any other Woman but his Wife Queen <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine:</hi>
and the Popiſh Party were ſure enough no Iſſue would
ſpring from thence to the Prejudice of their Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>And that the King might gratify this Faction, as well as he had
done the Nation in ſending the Duke of <hi>York</hi> out of it, he ſends
the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> after him; but the Duke being informed
that Baniſhment is a Puniſhment which the King cannot inflict
upon any Man unleſs he be convicted of ſome Crime, the Duke
of <hi>Monmouth</hi> returns again, and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> followes him,
with this different Succeſs, that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> had all
his Places of Profit and Truſt taken from him, and the Duke of
<hi>York</hi> was ſent High Commiſſioner into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Victory at <hi>Blackborn</hi> had left a clear Field in <hi>Scotland</hi>
for the Duke of <hi>York</hi> to play what Game he pleaſed; but how
well this agreed with the King's Speech at the opening of the
Parliament, <hi>That he had commanded his Brother to abſent himſelf
from him, becauſe he would not leave malicious Men room to ſay that
he had not removed all Cauſes which could be pretended to influence
him to Popiſh Councils,</hi> a little time will ſhew: but before we take a
View of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Actions in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it's fit to ſee how
things were carried on in <hi>England,</hi> between the Diſſolution of the
Parliament and the meeting of the next, or third <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Parliament
of this Reign.</p>
                  <p>The King by Proclamation diſſolved the Parliament upon the
<hi>12th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1679, and iſſued out Writs for the meeting of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> following; but like the uſual Methods of
other things in this Reign, when they met, he prorogued them
to the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> following, and then prorogued them to
the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> following, <hi>viz.</hi> 1680, and from thence to the
next <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>May:</hi> And when they then met, prorogued them to
the firſt of <hi>July,</hi> and from thence to the <hi>21ſt</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> when he
graciouſly declared they ſhould then ſit. And now let's ſee what's
doing in the mean while for the diſcovery and ſuppreſſing of the
Popiſh Plot.</p>
                  <p>To humour the Court the Tory Party ſet their Wits to work
to ridicule the Popiſh Plot, and <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange,</hi> as Penſioner of
the Party, comes weekly, or oftner out in defiance of it, who is
Party, Judg, Licenſer, and Rifler of the Preſs, whilſt his Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt
<hi>Care</hi> (who wrote <hi>The Weekly Packet of Advice from</hi> Rome,
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:60932:279"/>
wherein he diſcovered the Frauds and Superſtitions of that Court
and Church) is not only thereupon arraigned, convicted and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced,
for printing <hi>illicite,</hi> or without Licence; but by an Order
of the Court of <hi>King's Bench,</hi> it was ordained, <hi>That the Book</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

The Weekly Advice from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the
Hiſtory of Popery, <hi>ſhall not from thenceforth be printed or publiſhed
by any Perſon whatſoever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then a Deſign was ſet on foot to throw the Popiſh Plot upon
the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> by leaving Papers of a Plot in the Lodgings of
the principal Perſons, who were active in the diſcovery of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Plot, and then to ſearch their Houſes, and proſecute them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and theſe Papers to be given in Evidence againſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> was a principal Agent herein, and <hi>Dangerfield</hi> as her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
at firſt made an Attempt herein upon Colonel <hi>Manſel,</hi>
who was proſecuted upon it, but the Examination of it was refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to Sir <hi>William Jones,</hi> then Attorney General, upon whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of it to the Council, they thereupon voted Colonel <hi>Manſel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
and</hi> Dangerfield <hi>guilty, and that this was a Deſign of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
to lay the Plot upon the Diſſenters Charge, and a further Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
of the Popiſh Plot.</hi> But this was ſuch a Crime in Sir <hi>William Jones,</hi>
that he was ſoon after put out of his Place, and Sir <hi>Robert Sawy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi>
put in, who would not venture the loſs of his Place for ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Report.</p>
                  <p>By this time my Lord Chief Juſtice's Zeal, which he profeſſed
for diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, was inverted into the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and he was not of the Opinion of the Council: For after
this <hi>Dangerfield</hi> procured his Pardon, and then diſcovered the
whole Plot, which he printed; hereupon Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> was proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and tried before my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> upon the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
of <hi>June</hi> 1680. and Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> excepting againſt <hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s
Evidence, he having his Pardon, the Caſe was ſent to the Court of
<hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> for their Judgment upon it; who gave it, that
<hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s Evidence was good: yet let any Man read the Trial,
and ſee how the Chief Juſtice rated and vilified him, ſo as Mrs. <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
was quit; and after the Trial committed <hi>Dangerfield</hi> to Priſon,
upon the account there was a Defect in his Pardon, though it was
not then before him, whether there was any Defect in his Pardon
or not.</p>
                  <p>Then the Popiſh Party ſet another Deſign on foot, to ſuborn the
Diſcoverers of the Popiſh Plot, for which Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> was tried and
committed, and alſo to ſuborn, defame and ſcandalize the King's
Evidence in the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot: for which <hi>Thomas
Knox</hi> and <hi>John Lane</hi> were convicted upon the twenty fifth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember
1679,</hi> and <hi>John Tasborough</hi> and <hi>Ann Price</hi> upon the third
of <hi>February</hi> following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="547" facs="tcp:60932:279"/>
Another Step towards the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of Popery, was to diſcharge thoſe in Priſon upon it; and in
order to it, you may read in the Trial of Sir <hi>George Wakeman, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
and <hi>Marſhal,</hi> what a Streſs my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> put
upon <hi>Oates</hi> his not accuſing Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> upon his Letter
before the Council, when <hi>Oates</hi> was ſo tired, weak and confounded
with his other Evidence, that he was ſcarce able to ſtand; and how
the Chief Juſtice repeats this, and bids the Jury weigh it well,
and not be amazed or affrighted at the noiſe of Plots, and that
Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi>'s, <hi>Corker</hi>'s and <hi>Marſhal</hi>'s Blood lie at Stake, as
did his and the Juries Souls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi>'s
Trial, how he undervalued <hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s Evidence, and told the
Jury that Treaſon muſt be proved by two Witneſſes, and if they
doubted upon one, it was his Opinion it was but a ſingle Evidence.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Priſoners thus diſcharged, the next Deſign to crown the
Work, was to make a Precedent, That no future Proſecution ſhould
be made for convicting <hi>Roman Recuſants;</hi> and to that end, in <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
Term</hi> 1680, before the Parliament met, the Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi>
diſcharged the great Inqueſt of <hi>Oſwaldston,</hi> before they had given
in their Preſentments of ſeveral Bills of Indictments againſt the
Duke of <hi>York</hi> and other <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not find that in all theſe Tranſactions, the King made uſe
of the Council which he choſe the twentieth of <hi>April</hi> 1679, where
my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was Preſident, and Sir <hi>Henry Capel,</hi> Sir <hi>William
Temple,</hi> and many other noble Perſons were Members of it, when
he declared in Council, and Parliament, and to the whole Nation,
<hi>How ſenſible he was of the ill Poſture of his Affairs, and the great
Diſſatisfaction and great Jealouſies of his Subjects, whereby the Crown
and Government was become too weak to preſerve it ſelf, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from a ſingle Miniſtry, and of private Advices; and therefore
profeſs'd his Reſolution to lay them wholly aſide for the future, and to
be adviſed by thoſe able and worthy Perſons whom he had then choſen for
his Council; and by the frequent Advice of his Parliament in all his
weighty Affairs.</hi> I do not find when he diſſolved this Council, yet
I am confident none of theſe things were done by their Advice:
yet this I find that none of theſe were preſent, when the King
in Council the third of <hi>March</hi> 1679, declared againſt his Marriage
with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Mother, and this was within the
Year after the twentieth of <hi>April</hi> 1679. How the Duke of <hi>York</hi>
carried on the Deſign of the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
the Suppreſſion of Popery in <hi>Scotland</hi> at this time, is not
yet ripe to be declared; but in this Poſture things ſtood in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
when the Parliament met the twenty firſt of <hi>October</hi> 1680.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Upon the opening of the Parliament, the King told them,</hi> The
ſeveral Prorogations he had made, had been very advantagious to our
Neighbours, and very uſeful to him; for he had employed that time
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:60932:280"/>
in making and perfecting an Alliance with <hi>Spain,</hi> ſutable to that which
he had before made with the States of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces, and they
alſo had with <hi>Spain,</hi> conſiſting of mutual Obligations of Succour an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Defence.</p>
                  <p>So then it was not for the Tranſactions aforeſaid, and the ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Duke of <hi>York</hi> High Commiſſioner into <hi>Scotland,</hi> which no
doubt but the Parliament, if they had been ſitting, would have
boggled at, but for making and perfecting Alliances with the
<hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland;</hi> and if any ſuch Alliances were making, or
made, what would the ſitting of the Parliament have hindred them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I'm ſure they might and would have advanced them.</p>
                  <p>It was in <hi>November</hi> 1677, that by the Agreement between the
King and Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> ſhould deliver up to the King
of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Towns of <hi>Aeth, Charleroy, Oudenard, Courtray, Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,
Valenciennes,</hi> St. <hi>Gillain,</hi> and <hi>Binch; Lorain</hi> to that Duke, and
the Towns which the <hi>French</hi> had taken in <hi>Alſatia</hi> to the Emperor:
and in caſe of Refuſal within two days after by the <hi>French</hi> King
our King was to declare War againſt the <hi>French</hi> King, and join with
the <hi>Dutch</hi> States and Confederates to compel the <hi>French</hi> to it; and
at the Prince's Departure promiſed him never to depart from the
leaſt Point of it.</p>
                  <p>It was not two Weeks before the King brake this Promiſe, and
to amuſe and raiſe a Jealouſy among the Confederates by Mr. <hi>Thy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi>
(Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> refuſing to have any hand in it) about the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of <hi>December</hi> following made a ſeparate League with the
<hi>Dutch</hi> States upon the Parliament's giving him 1200000 <hi>l.</hi> to enter
into an actual War againſt <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>May</hi> following, <hi>viz.</hi> 1678. the King took <hi>French</hi> Money to
join with a Faction in <hi>Holland,</hi> to make a ſeparate Peace with
<hi>France,</hi> upon delivery of ſix of the nine Towns to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
whereof two of the three not to be delivered to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> were
<hi>Tournay</hi> and <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> worth all the reſt; and the Duke of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
and the Emperor left looſe and uncertain.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>July</hi> following, upon the <hi>French</hi> refuſal to deliver up theſe
ſix Towns to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the King would declare War againſt
<hi>France,</hi> and join with the <hi>Dutch</hi> and the reſt of the Confederates
in it.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon Sir <hi>William</hi> was ſent to the <hi>Hague,</hi> and in ſix days
time concluded a League with the States, that if within fourteen
days after the Date of it, <hi>France</hi> did not declare to evacuate theſe
ſix Towns, <hi>Holland</hi> engaged to proceed in the War againſt <hi>France,</hi>
and Sir <hi>William</hi> ſent over the Conditions to be ratified by the King.</p>
                  <p>During theſe Tranſactions in <hi>Holland,</hi> and it may be before the
League came over to be ratified by the King, the King ſent <hi>Du Cres</hi>
with Inſtructions to Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> to remove from the <hi>Hague</hi>
to <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and to divulge that the King and <hi>French</hi> King had
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:60932:280"/>
abſolutely agreed and conſented to a Peace, and that he had
brought Orders to Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> to go ſtraight to <hi>Nimeguen,</hi>
where he ſhould meet with Letters from my Lord of <hi>Sunderland</hi>
the King's Ambaſſador at <hi>Paris,</hi> with all the Particulars concluded
between them: The Fourteen Days for the <hi>French</hi> Agreement
to evacuate the Towns, running ſo faſt away in the mean time,
that <hi>Beverning</hi> and his Faction, upon the laſt of the Fourteen Days,
pleaded a petty Neceſſity of huddling up that treacherous Peace
which left Chriſtendom to the Mercy of the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Would not one think it ſtrange now, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> and poor
<hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhould have ſuch a mutual Confidence in our King's Faith,
and to truſt to his mutual Obligations of Succour and Defence?
Or that the King ſhould be ſo ſtaid in making this League? for it
was above eighteen Months after the Prorogation of the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
to the Meeting of this, and above Fifteen Months from
the Diſſolution of it; and yet ſo haſty in all his other Leagues.</p>
                  <p>After the Benefits which <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> as well as <hi>England,</hi> may
reap by theſe Alliances, if our Diviſions at home do not make our
Friendſhip leſs conſiderable, the King thought fit to renew all
Aſſurance that can be deſired for Security of the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which he is reſolved to maintain againſt the Conſpiracies of
our Enemies: <q>Can any Man who reads the Tranſactions between
the Prorogation of the laſt Parliament, and the Meeting of this,
force a Belief of this?</q> And concur with any new Remedies
which ſhall be propoſed, which may conſiſt with preſerving the
Succeſſion of the Crown in its due and legal Courſe of Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;
<q>That is, Let the Wolf be Shepherd, and let the Sheep
make what Laws they pleaſe for their Preſervation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Was it not known that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was a Jeſuited <hi>Papiſt;</hi>
whoſe Maxims are, That no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks,
which he eſteemed all others in <hi>England</hi> but thoſe of his own
<hi>Romiſh</hi> Faction to be? Could the King believe that the Duke's Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
could be any Security to the Proteſtant Religion (as the
King calls it) which the Duke eſteemed Hereſy, and to be rooted
out by Fire and Sword? or that any other but the Duke's Faction
could be protected by him, when he eſteemed them Hereticks,
Schiſmaticks, Church-Robbers, and no Chriſtians?</p>
                  <p>It's true, at this time the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> was made a Priſoner,
to reſtrain him from his immoral and wicked Actions, whilſt
his Brother in his Impriſonment acted as Regent of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in
his Brother's Name: But upon the Duke's Succeſſion, how could
a Regent act when the King was not a <hi>Minor,</hi> but of full Age
double, and at large, in the King's Name, and contrary to his
Will and Pleaſure, and this to conſiſt with the Security of the
Proteſtant Religion or Laws?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="550" facs="tcp:60932:281"/>
In the Debates in the Houſe of Commons, many Expedients
were propounded, how the eſtabliſhed Government in Church and
State could be preſerved, and none could be found in caſe the
Duke ſucceeded: ſo the Country Party moved, that the Court
Party would propound Expedients herein; but either they could
not, or had no Inſtructions from the Court to warrant ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients
as they ſhould propound.</p>
                  <p>But if the due and legal Deſcent of the Crown muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
though to the Deſtruction of the Church and State; they
who adviſed the King to be ſo poſitive herein, ſhould have done
well to have declared what Law in <hi>England</hi> declares the Deſcent
of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> or how this becomes due. I am ſure
the Act of the firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the IV intailed the Crown upon the
King, and the Heirs of his Body; and ſo did that of the firſt of
<hi>Henry</hi> VII. before he married the Lady <hi>Elizabeth, Edward</hi> the
Fourth's Daughter; and if <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh's Title to the Crown
had been good by inherent Birth-right, yet he had been an Uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
For his Mother, under whom he claimed, lived all his Reign,
and ſo ſhe did ſome time after <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII became King, as
you may read in <hi>Stow</hi>'s Hiſtory, <hi>p.</hi> 487. And how was the due and
Legal Succeſſion of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> obſerved in the Reign
of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII, when by his Will he might name what Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
he pleaſed, as has been ſaid; or in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign,
when it was in Parliament declared Treaſon to affirm the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might not diſpoſe of the Succeſſion of the Crown in her
Reign, and a <hi>Premunire</hi> at this Day? And let any Man ſhew that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
there were three Kings before theſe of the <hi>Scotiſh Race,</hi> in
the <hi>Saxon, Daniſh,</hi> or <hi>Norman</hi> Race, which ſucceeded ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by inherent Birth-right, I will ſubmit that all I have ſaid is not
true: and why then muſt ſuch a Streſs be put for the preſerving the
Deſcent of the Crown in its due and legal Courſe, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
what is that due and legal Courſe, to endanger the Subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Church and State of <hi>England?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the King recommends to the Parliament, a Strict Enquiry
into the Popiſh Plot, and that the Lords in the Tower be brought
to a ſpeedy Trial, without which he did not think himſelf or the
Parliament ſafe. The conſtant Vogue was, <q>That the King diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
the two laſt Parliaments to preſerve the Lords in the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
from being brought to Trial;</q> and I am ſure that you will
ſoon hear that the King did not believe his and the Nation's Safety
did conſiſt in the Trial of the Lords in the Tower.</p>
                  <p>Then the King tells the Parliament what Danger <hi>Tangier</hi> was in,
and what vaſt Expence he muſt be at to keep it: <q>And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
laſt Parliament drew up an Act to ſettle it upon the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and that they who did adviſe the King to
part with <hi>Tangier</hi> to any Foreign Prince or State, or were inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:60932:281"/>
therein, ought to be accounted Enemies to the King and
Kingdom.</q> And what Care the King took to keep it, will ſoon
appear, tho 'twas ſaid, the Parliament (I think it was out of the
Chimney-Bill) gave him 40000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> towards the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of it to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King goes on and ſays, That above all the Treaſure in
the World, which he was ſure would give him greater Strength
both at home and abroad, than any Treaſure can do, is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Union among our ſelves, <hi>yet ſays not wherein we ſhould unite.</hi>
                     <q>Truth and Unity are one, and conſiſt in intire Parts; but Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood
and Diſcord are infinite: What Truth or Unity could be
in the King's looſe and irregular Actions, ſo confounding, and
every day varying from what he had promiſed before? Or how
is it poſſible for the Nation to unite under Terms which are
inconſiſtible and impoſſible, <hi>viz.</hi> Unite to preſerve the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of the Kingdom, and yet be at no Diſcord with the
King, who they were morally certain, would make it his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
to ſubvert them?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we ſhould be ſo unhappy (the King ſays) as to fall into ſuch
Miſunderſtanding among our ſelves as would render our Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
unſafe to truſt to, it will not be wondred at if our Allies
ſhall begin to take up new Reſolutions, and perhaps ſuch as may
be fatal to us; and adviſed them not to gratify our Enemies, and
diſhearten our Friends by any unreaſonable Diſputes, <hi>viz.</hi> to take
all by an implicit Faith. <q>I do not underſtand what the King means
by Miſunderſtanding among our ſelves, which may render our
Friendſhip to our or his Allies unſafe; nor does he ſay wherein
ſuch Miſunderſtanding conſiſts; I'm ſure the Parliament miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood
him when they gave him 1200000 <hi>l.</hi> to enter into
an actual War againſt the <hi>French</hi> King, in the Defence of theſe
Allies; and when he had got the Money, to make a ſeparate
Peace with a Faction of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to the Ruine of his Allies;
and take <hi>French</hi> Money for it: and to get the Parliament twice
over to disband this Army, for fear he ſhould turn it againſt them
and the Nation; and now 'twas disbanded, to give Money to
raiſe another, upon Pretence of aſſiſting theſe Allies, now they
were forced to ſuch a diſhonourable Peace with the <hi>French;</hi> or
that our Allies, as the King calls them, would ever truſt to any
more of his Alliances.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any ſhould ſo happen (the King ſays) the World will ſee it
is no Fault of his, for he had done all that was poſſible for him
to do to keep us in Peace while he lived, and to leave us ſo when
he died.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Can any Man believe the King believed himſelf herein? Or
that any Man will be his Voucher for it? Even my Lord <hi>C. F.</hi>
out of the Field of his ſweet liſping Eloquence, could not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:60932:282"/>
one Rhetorical Flower to make a Flouriſh upon this Speech;
nor aſſure the Parliament upon his Veracity, that Now, Now
was the time to ſecure their Religion and Properties: nay, the
Commons gave ſo little Credit to this Speech, that they would
not deign to debate it,</q> or one Paragraph in it.</p>
                  <p>Neither the Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t of <hi>Tangier,</hi> nor the King's making Alliances
with the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniard</hi> (if any ſuch were in his Ramble of
Prorogations of this Parliament) would make the Commons give
more Money: This Parliament met in a contrary Humour to that
of the Long Parliament, and that from contrary Cauſes; for that
Parliament adored him as their Deliverer from the Rage and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of the late times, whereas this Parliament met in Dread
and Terror of the Nation at preſent, and were frighted at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the Conſequence of it after the King's Death.</p>
                  <p>The Commons heated by the Diſſolutions of the two laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
when they were ſearching into the Diſcovery of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Plot; and exaſperated againſt the <hi>Tories,</hi> for ridiculing the
Popiſh Plot, and for abhorring petitioning the King to let the
Parliament ſit, in order to proſecute and ſecure the Nation againſt
it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proceeded in another Temper, I think, than any other ever
before: and in Truth I do not deſire the Proſecution of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in the Long Parliament in the firſt ten Years againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Diſſenters, and of the Commons of this Parliament againſt
the <hi>Tories,</hi> ſhould be taken for Precedents by any Parliament in
time to come.</p>
                  <p>When Parliaments met annually, or at leaſt frequently, I think
a Complaint cannot be found againſt any Man for Breach of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege:
but when there were long Intervals of Parliaments, from
whence the Conſequence reſolved into long Sittings of Parliaments,
which began in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, then the Inconvenience
(I may ſay) of Privilege of Parliament firſt began; nor do I find
any before the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, nor does Mr. <hi>Petit,</hi> in his
<hi>Precedents from Arreſts,</hi> and other Privileges of Parliament-men,
cite any before the Thirty fourth of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, in Caſe of Mr.
<hi>George Ferrers,</hi> Burgeſs for the Town of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> being arreſted for
Debt; and this was taken for ſuch a Novelty, that he takes up
near ſeven Pages to recite the Proceedings of the Commons upon
it; and how the King being advertiſed thereof, called the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour,
the Judges, the Speaker of the Commons, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
Perſons of them, wherein he commended the Wiſdom of
the Commons in maintaining their Privileges (which he would not
in any Point have infringed) and that the Privileges of Parliament
extend to the Servants of the Commons from Arreſts, as well as to
the Perſons of the Commons. It's worthy Obſervation with what
Sobriety and Juſtice the Commons proceeded herein: They or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:60932:282"/>
their Serjeant forthwith to repair to the Compter in <hi>Bread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi>
wherein Mr. <hi>Ferrers</hi> was committed, with his Mace to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his Delivery, which the Serjeant did to the Officers of the
Compter, who notwithſtanding refuſed to do it, and beat and hurt
ſome of the Serjeant's Officers, and broke his Mace; and during the
Brawl the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> came in, who countenanced the Officers
of the Compter, and refuſed to deliver Mr. <hi>Ferrers,</hi> and gave the
Serjeant proud Language, and contemptuouſly rejected his Meſſage:
Hereupon the Commons commanded the Serjeant to demand the
Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> to deliver Mr. <hi>Ferrers,</hi> by ſhewing them his
Mace, which was his Warrant for ſo doing; whereupon the
Sheriffs delivered him accordingly; but then the Serjeant having
further Command from the Commons, charged the Sheriffs to
appear perſonally on the Morrow by eight of the Clock, before
the Speaker in the nether Houſe (or of the Commons) to bring
thither the Clerks of the Compter, and ſuch other of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
as were Parties in the Fray, and to take into Cuſtody one <hi>White,</hi>
who had wittingly procured the ſaid Arreſt, in contempt of the
Privilege of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The next day the two Sheriffs, with one of the Clerks of the
Compter, and the ſaid <hi>White,</hi> appeared in the Commons Houſe,
where the Speaker charging them with their Contempt and Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour,
they were compelled to make immediate Anſwer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being admitted to Counſel; and in concluſion the Sheriffs, and
the ſaid <hi>White</hi> were committed to the Tower, and the Clerk (which
was the Occaſion of the Fray) to a place called <hi>Little Eaſe,</hi> and
the Officer which did the Arreſt, called <hi>Taylor,</hi> with four other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where they remained from the Twenty eighth
to the Thirty firſt of <hi>March,</hi> and then were delivered at the humble
Suit of the Mayor and their other Friends.</p>
                  <p>The next Breach of Privilege reported by <hi>Petit,</hi> is eight Years
after, <hi>viz.</hi> the fourth of <hi>Edward</hi> VI, by one <hi>Withrington,</hi> who
made an Aſſault upon the Perſon of one <hi>Brandling,</hi> Burgeſs of
<hi>New-caſtle;</hi> but the Parliament drawing towards an End, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
ſent <hi>Withrington</hi> to the Privy Council; but the Council
would not meddle in it, and ſent the Bill of Mr. <hi>Brandling</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
back again to the Commons according to the antient Cuſtom
of the Houſe; whereupon the Bill was ſent to the Lords from the
Commons, when <hi>Withrington</hi> confeſt he began the Fray upon Dr.
<hi>Brandling,</hi> upon which he was committed to the Tower. This was
in the Year 1550.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Petit</hi> finds not another Breach of Privilege, till the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> twenty one Years after, which was done by
one <hi>Arthur Hall,</hi> for ſundry lewd Speeches uſed as well in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
Houſe, as abroad; who was warned by the Serjeant to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:60932:283"/>
before the Bar of the Commons to anſwer for the ſame, and
upon his Speech, upon the humble Confeſſion of his Folly, he was
remitted, with a good Exhortation given him by the Speaker.
Here I obſerve theſe three Particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. The Rarity of theſe Breaches of Privileges of Parliament in
former times.</p>
                  <p>2. The Juſtice of the Commons in their Proceedings of Breach
of Privilege, to cite the Perſon or Perſons to appear before them,
to anſwer for themſelves before the Houſe paſſed any Cenſure upon
them.</p>
                  <p>3. That in none of theſe Cenſures they enjoined the Delinquent
to pay their Fees to their Serjeant, for the Serjeant is the King's
Officer, and by the <hi>26th Weſt.</hi> 1. no Officer of the King's ſhall
take any Fee or Reward for doing his Office, but what he receives
from the King, upon Penalty of rendring double to the Plaintiff,
and be further puniſhed at the Will of the King. And Sir <hi>Edward
Coke</hi> in his firſt <hi>Inſt. Lib. 3. Sect. 701. Tit. Extortioners,</hi> ſays, this
was the antient common Law, and the Penalties added by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute;
and that tho ſome Statutes ſince have allowed the King's Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
in ſome Caſes to take Fees for executing their Offices, yet
none other can be taken but what ſuch Statutes allow; and that
all Officers of the King, who take Fees otherwiſe, are guilty of
Perjury. I would know by what Law the Commons Serjeant takes
his Fees, and how the Commons can abſolve him from Perjury for
taking ſuch Fees.</p>
                  <p>Whereas in this Parliament rarely a Day paſſed wherein Men
upon bare Suggeſtions, and abſent, were not judged, and Execution
ordered for high Breaches, and notorious Breaches of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
Privileges, yet moſt of theſe not foreknown, and ordered to
be taken into Cuſtody, tho in <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Yorkſhire:</hi> and
rarely I think any of them were diſcharged without paying their
Fees, but what Fees was what the Serjeant pleaſed; nay, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
outrun all which was ever thought of before: For on <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> having voted one Mr. <hi>Herbert Herring</hi> to
be taken into Cuſtody, and Mr. <hi>Herring</hi> abſconding from being
taken, the Houſe reſolved, <q>That if he did not render himſelf
by a certain Day, they would proceed againſt him by Bill in
Parliament for endeavouring by his abſconding to avoid the
Juſtice of the Houſe.</q> Though I doubt the Lords, in the
Temper they were in, nor the King neither, would have paſſed
ſuch a Bill.</p>
                  <p>It was ſtrange methought that the Commons ſhould be ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
againſt any Arbitrary Power in the King, and take ſuch a
Latitude to themſelves; which puts me in mind of a Story I
have heard of an old Uſurer, who had a Nephew, who had
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:60932:283"/>
got a Licence to preach, and the Uncle having never done any
thing for his Nephew, he reſolved to be revenged upon his Uncle
in a Sermon which he would preach before his Uncle in the Pariſh
where he lived, and made a moſt invective Sermon againſt Uſury
and Uſurers; but after the Sermon was done, the Uncle thank'd
his Nephew for his good Sermon, and gave him 2 Twenty-ſhilling
Pieces: the Nephew was confounded at this, and begg'd his Uncle's
Pardon for what he had done, for he thought he had given him
great Offence; <hi>No,</hi> ſaid the Uncle, <hi>Nephew, go on and preach other
Fools out of the Conceit of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury, and I ſhall have the better Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of putting out my Money.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet ſo zealous were the Commons againſt Popery and Arbitrary
Power, that upon the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> they reſolved that one
Mean for the Suppreſſion of Popery is, That a Bill be brought in
to baniſh immediately all conſiderable Papiſts out of the King's
Dominions.</p>
                  <p>And that a Bill be brought in for an Aſſociation of all his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Proteſtant Subjects, for the Defence of his Majeſty's Perſon,
the Defence of the Proteſtant Religion, and for the Preſervation
of his Majeſty's Proteſtant Subjects, againſt all Invaſions and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
whatſoever, and for preventing the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> or
any other Papiſt, from ſucceeding to the Crown.</p>
                  <p>And upon the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> the Commons read another Bill
the firſt time for exempting his Majeſty's Proteſtant Subjects diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
from the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the Penalties impoſed
upon the Papiſts; and upon the <hi>18th</hi> ordered a Bill to be brought
in to unite his Majeſty's Proteſtant Subjects.</p>
                  <p>In this Ferment of the Commons this Parliament, they run
counter to the Commons of the laſt Parliament; for then they
choſe Mr. <hi>Edward Seymour</hi> to be their Speaker, and when the
King refuſed him, they were much diſguſted: but in this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Commons the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> impeached him upon
four Articles, and a Motion was made for an Addreſs to be made
to remove him from his Majeſty's Council and Preſence. And in
the laſt Parliament the Commons would not proceed to the Trial
of the Popiſh Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> before the Lords ſhould give
their Judgment upon the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>'s Plea; whereas in this
Parliament they proceeded to the Condemnation of my Lord
<hi>Stafford,</hi> without taking any notice, that I can find, of having the
Lords Judgment upon the Earl's Plea.</p>
                  <p>The Commons took Care alſo to proſecute and impeach all
thoſe that countenanced the Popiſh Plot, or were Abhorrers of
petitioning the King for the Meeting of the Parliament in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
Prorogations of it; and voted, <hi>That it is, and ever hath
been, the undoubted Right of the Subjects of</hi> England, <hi>to petition the
King for the Calling and Sitting of Parliaments, and Redreſs of Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="556" facs="tcp:60932:284"/>
And that to traduce ſuch petitioning as a Violation of Duty, and to
repreſent it to his Majeſty as tumultuous and ſeditious, is to betray the
Liberty of the Subject, and contributes to the Deſign of ſubverting the
antient legal Conſtitutions of this Kingdom, and introducing Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Power.</p>
                  <p>The firſt that fell under theſe Votes was Sir <hi>Francis Withens</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
made a Judg) a Member of the Commons, whom they voted
to be a Betrayer of the undoubted Rights of the Subjects of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and ordered him to be expelled the Houſe for this high
Crime, and to receive the Sentence at the Bar of the Houſe kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
which he ſubmitted to.</p>
                  <p>The next was Sir <hi>George Jefferies,</hi> then Recorder of the City;
and ordered that an humble Addreſs be made to the King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
him out of all publick Offices, and that the Members which
ſerved for the City ſhould communicate this Vote to the Court of
Aldermen.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Account (tho the Commons diſcriminated the Crime)
they ordered Sir <hi>Giles Philips</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> to be ſent for into
Cuſtody of the Serjeant at Arms, for deteſting and abhorring the
petitioning for ſitting of the Parliament, and voted it a Breach
of Privilege of Parliament: the like the Commons did by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>William Caſtle,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Hutchinſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry Walrond,</hi>
Mr. <hi>William Stavel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Herbert,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Holt</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
at Law, and Mr. <hi>Thomas Staples:</hi> and becauſe Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
North</hi> (Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Common Pleas)</hi> adviſed, and was
aſſiſting in drawing up a Proclamation againſt petitioning for the
ſitting of the Parliament; the Commons voted, <hi>That it was a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Ground for the Houſe to proceed against him for high Crimes and
Miſdemeanours.</hi> The like Vote paſſed againſt Sir <hi>Thomas Jones,</hi> one
of the Judges of the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Weſton</hi> one of
the Barons of the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> I do not find theſe Votes went fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but the Commons actually impeached Sir <hi>William Scroggs</hi> of
High Treaſon, for diſcharging the Grand Jury of <hi>Middleſex</hi> before
they had finiſhed their Preſentments, and for the Order made in
the <hi>King's Bench</hi> againſt <hi>Care</hi>'s <hi>Pacquet of Advice from</hi> Rome, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>the Hiſtory of Popery,</hi> that it ſhould be no more printed or publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by any Perſon whatſoever. I do not find the Articles particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
recited, but they were ingroſſed upon the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi>
and the Impeachment carried up to the Lords by my Lord <hi>Cav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh,</hi>
and received by the Lords.</p>
                  <p>Note, in this common Danger the Commons ordered Leave to
bring in a Bill <hi>for a general Naturalization of all Proteſtant Aliens,</hi>
giving them Liberty to exerciſe their Trades in all Corporations.
Now it's time to ſee wherein the Lords and Commons did agree,
and wherein they ran counter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="557" facs="tcp:60932:284"/>
The Lords agreed with the Commons in repealing the Act of
35 <hi>Elizabeth, viz.</hi> for Payment of 20 <hi>l. per menſem</hi> for every Man
who reſorted not to his Pariſh-Church, being ſo terrible a Law,
that it lay <hi>dormant</hi> above 80 Years, and in the Feuds between the
<hi>Tories</hi> and <hi>Whigs,</hi> it was begun to be put in Execution; which the
Commons apprehending would make a Breach ſo wide as to let in
Popery, which would make no Diſtinction between Diſſenters and
the Sons of the Church, they brought in a Bill for repealing the
ſaid Act of 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which paſſed the Commons upon the <hi>26th</hi>
of <hi>November,</hi> and was ſent up to the Lords, who agreed to it.</p>
                  <p>As the Lords joined with the Commons in paſſing this Repeal,
ſo did the Commons join with the Lords in their Vote the <hi>4th</hi> of
<hi>January,</hi> viz.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
That they do declare that they are fully ſatisfied, that there now
is, and for divers Years laſt paſt there hath been, an horrid and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Plot and Conſpiracy, contrived and carried on by thoſe of the
Popiſh Religion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for maſſacring the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſubverting
the Proteſtant Religion, and antient eſtabliſhed Government of that
Kingdom. <hi>To which the Commons added,</hi> That the Duke of <hi>York</hi>
being a Papiſt, and the Expectation that Party had of his coming to
the Crown, hath given the greatest Encouragement to the Popiſh Plot,
as well in <hi>Ireland</hi> as here.</p>
                  <p>But the Lords ran counter to the Commons in the Bill intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>An Act for ſecuring the Proteſtant Religion,</hi> by diſabling <hi>James</hi>
Duke of <hi>York</hi> to inherit the Imperial Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
and Territories thereunto belonging; for after the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it the firſt time in the Houſe of Lords, and the Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put, whether it ſhould be read a ſecond time, it was reſolv'd
in the Negative by above a double Majority of Votes.</p>
                  <p>If the Lords and Commons ran counter in ſome things, the King
and Commons ran counter almoſt in every thing. The King's
main End in calling this Parliament, was to get Money for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of <hi>Tangier,</hi> and in perfecting the Alliance he had made
with <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Commons would not give any Money upon the Account of
<hi>Tangier,</hi> for three Reaſons: One was, For that as the ſtate of the
Nation ſtood, it might augment the Strength of the Popiſh Party,
and encreaſe the Danger of the Nation: Another was, There were
ſeveral Regiments beſides the Guards in pay in <hi>England,</hi> which
might be tranſported to <hi>Tangier</hi> with little Charge, and be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
there as cheap as here: And the third was, That that Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
was the Nurſery of Popiſh Officers and Soldiers.</p>
                  <p>The Commons would not give Money for the pretended Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of mutual Obligations of Succour and Defence with <hi>Spain,</hi>
for three Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="558" facs="tcp:60932:285"/>
1. The Jealouſy they had of the King's Sincerity in this Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and the more becauſe the King did not declare to them what
manner of Alliance this was, and it might be more to the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
than Benefit of this Kingdom; or if it ſhould have been to the
Benefit of the Kingdom, they could have no more Aſſurance of
the Performance of it, than they had of the Triple League, that
made with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> or that made between the King
and <hi>States of Holland</hi> by Mr. <hi>Thyn</hi> on the King's Part, which were
all broken almoſt as ſoon as made.</p>
                  <p>2. The Impoſſibility of any Benefit which could ariſe to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Spain</hi> by ſuch an Alliance: for if all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> after
the ſeparate Peace which the King joined with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Faction
in, could not uphold <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
under the Dominion of the <hi>French,</hi> how could the King, in
the feeble and diſtracted ſtate of the Nation, be in a condition to
ſupport it without them?</p>
                  <p>3. The Unreaſonableneſs of giving Money upon this Account;
for tho oftentimes the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have demanded Supplies
for maintaining vaſt Wars, yet never any King of <hi>England</hi> before
demanded Supplies for making Alliances, and not declare what
ſuch Alliances were.</p>
                  <p>But if any ſuch mutual Alliances of Succour and Defence were
made between our King and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> I'm ſure they were
ill obſerved by the King; for two Years after, <hi>viz.</hi> 1682, the
<hi>French</hi> blocked up the City of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> and the next Year took
<hi>Courtray</hi> (one of the ſix Towns delivered back to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
by <hi>Beverning</hi>'s ſeparate Treaty from the Confederates) and keeps
it to this Day; and ſo the <hi>French</hi> King does <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> which
he took by plain Force from the <hi>Spaniard</hi> the next Year after, <hi>viz.
1684.</hi> I wiſh I could find any mutual Succour of Defence the
King gave the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in any of theſe, either by this Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
or as the King was Guarantee in the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle,</hi>
which in his Proclamation againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in the ſecond
<hi>Dutch</hi> War, he declared he would maintain.</p>
                  <p>Nor did the Commons only run counter to the King's Deſigns
of getting Money, but conſidering the dangerous and weak ſtate of
the Kingdom, as by the Debt the King had contracted by ſhutting
up the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and his ſquandring away almoſt all the antient
Revenues of the Crown; and to prevent the like upon the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
ſettled upon the King ſince his Reſtoration, upon the <hi>7th</hi> of
<hi>January</hi> reſolved.</p>
                  <p>1. That whoſoever ſhall lend or cauſe to be lent, by way of Advance,
any Money upon the Branches of the King's Revenue, ariſing by Cuſtoms,
Exciſe, or Hearth-money, ſhall be adjudged a Hinderer of the Sitting
of Parliaments, and be reſponſible for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="559" facs="tcp:60932:285"/>
2. That whoſoever ſhall accept or buy any Tally or Anticipation upon
any part of the King's Revenue; or whoſoever ſhall pay ſuch Tally here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to be ſtruck, ſhall be adjudged to hinder the Sittings of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and be reſponſible therefore in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Now let's ſee wherein the King run counter to both Lords and
Commons. After the Lords had agreed with the Commons in the
Repeal of 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Bill was taken from the Lords Table, and
never heard of after, which no Man durſt have done without the
King's Command, at leaſt Privity. Herein you may obſerve the
Inſincerity of the King's Indulgences, for diſpenſing with the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Laws againſt Diſſenters, when he nouriſhed thoſe Ends by
them which the Parliament dreaded; and now the Parliament
would have legally eaſed them, the Bill muſt be raviſhed away.</p>
                  <p>Here is a greater Wonder yet to be told of this Parliament; for
notwithſtanding all theſe Diſcords between the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and the King and the Lords and Commons, yet they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
in making the Act againſt the Importation of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> perpetual, thereby to perpetuate the Diſcords between
the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as much as thoſe between
<hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory.</hi> And in this poſture of Affairs the King prorogu'd
the Parliament from the <hi>10th</hi> to the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1681, and
upon the <hi>18th</hi> diſſolved them. This Diſſolution cauſed a great
Amazement in the Nation; but in ſome meaſure to allay it, the
King ſummons another to meet the <hi>21st</hi> of <hi>March</hi> following, at
<hi>Oxford.</hi> This rais'd a Jealouſy in the Nation and many of the
Nobility, that there was ſome hidden Deſign nouriſhed in the
Court, which might have dangerous Influences upon the Nation
and the Parliament too.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon 16 of the Nobility petitioned the King againſt the
Meeting of the Parliament at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Delivery of it, made a ſhort Speech, which I believe was
not forgotten afterwards.</p>
                  <p>The Lords in their Petition ſet forth, <q>That the King, by
divers Speeches and Meſſages to both Houſes of Parliament, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to them the Danger which threatned his Perſon and the
whole Kingdom, from the miſchievous and wicked Plots of the
Papiſts, and the ſudden Growth of a foreign Power, from
which no Remedy could be provided, unleſs by Parliament,
and the uniting the King's Proteſtant Subjects.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That upon the <hi>21st</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1679, his Majeſty having cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
a Council of many honourable Perſons, declared to the
Parliament and whole Nation, That being ſenſible of the Evil
of a ſingle Miniſtry or private Advice, for the future he would
refer all things to that Council, with the frequent Advice of
his great Council of Parliament.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="560" facs="tcp:60932:286"/>
                     <q>That to their unſpeakable Grief, that Parliament was ſoon
after prorogued, and diſſolved before it could perfect their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Relief and Security to the Nation; and tho another
were called, yet they were not permitted to ſit till the <hi>21st</hi> of
<hi>October</hi> laſt, when his Majeſty declared, That neither his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
nor the Kingdom could be ſafe till the Plot was gone
through; yet upon the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> following it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued,
whereby all their pious Endeavours to ſave the Nation
were overthrown, and the good Bills for uniting his Proteſtant
Subjects brought to nought, the Diſcovery of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Plot ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled,
and the Witneſſes to prove the ſame diſcouraged, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Strength and Courage of our Enemies both at home and
abroad, are encreaſed, and our ſelves and Country left in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be loſt and brought to Deſolation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That in theſe Extremities, under God they had nothing to
comfort them but the Hopes of the Parliament's meeting at the
Day to which they were prorogued; but that not only failed by
their Diſſolution, but to call another at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where neither
Lords nor Commons can be in Safety, but expoſed to the Swords
of Papiſts and their Adherents, of whom too many were crept
into his Majeſty's Guards; the Liberty of Speaking deſtroyed,
and the Validity of their Acts left diſputable: That the Strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Place could not admit of the Concourſe of People
which follow the Parliament: That the Witneſſes to give Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
againſt the Popiſh Lords and others would be put to
great Charges, which they cannot bear, nor truſt themſelves
under the Protection of the Parliament, which it ſelf is under
the Power of Guards and Souldiers; and therefore pray that
the Parliament may meet and ſit at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
                     </q> Sir <hi>W. J. adds
another Reaſon,</hi> 
                     <q>That the Meeting of the Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi>
would have the Inconvenience of making uſe of the Journals
of the Houſes, and other Records.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not find what Anſwer the King gave the Lords, but
he expreſſed his Diſpleaſure by a Frown: and how looſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he was in all his Promiſes to the Parliament, you'll ſee
him ſteddy in this of the Parliament's meeting at <hi>Oxford,</hi> yet
not forget the Lords that petitioned him, whereof the Duke
of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Bedford, Eſſex,</hi> and <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> were
four. But before we proceed to diſcover what was done in
this ſhort Interval between the Diſſolution of this laſt <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>
Parliament and the meeting of that at <hi>Oxford,</hi> it will
not be amiſs to take the Reſemblance which was between the
<hi>Tories</hi> and <hi>Whigs</hi> at this time, with the Prerogative-Men and
Puritans during <hi>Laud</hi>'s Regency in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi>
the Firſt.</p>

In thoſe Times the Prerogative and high-flown Church-men,
however they were countenanced and preferred by the Court,
yet of all Factions were the leaſt conſiderable in the Nation,
and had the leaſt Intereſt in it, even leſs than the Papiſt; and
when they had by their Extravagancies and tyrannical Dominion
given ſuch a Reputation to the Puritan Party, as by Contradiction
or Oppoſition of them to be able to raiſe a War in the Nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they were not only leſs aſſiſting the King in it than the Papiſts,
but generally ran counter, and they and their Sons joined with
the Puritans againſt the King: So that the King being aſſiſted
in the War by the Nobility and Gentry, who deſired to preſerve
the Conſtitutions of the Church and State, and by the Papiſts,
the Storm fell upon them without Diſtinction; ſo that theſe
equally exaſperated againſt the Factions, upon King <hi>Charles</hi>'s
Reſtoration were eaſily reconciled to join againſt them: and
thus it continued not only in the Body of the Nation, but
in the Parliament for the firſt ten Years after the King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration.</p>
                  <p>But then the Popiſh Deſigns at Court beginning to appear
almoſt bare-fac'd, the Commons began to tack about, but ſo
did not the Lords, eſpecially the Lords Spiritual, who could
not forget the Injury done, not only to their Perſons, but their
whole Order, as well in throwing them out of the Lords Houſe,
as extirpating Epiſcopacy: and the King having multiplied a
Nobility of his Favourites, theſe joined with the Biſhops (who
yet maintained the King's abſolute Power, under a new Title
of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> to it) had a great Majority oppoſite to the
Commons.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Laud</hi>'s Inſtruments had the Dominion of the Preſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they vented all their Spight againſt the Puritans, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them if they made any Anſwer, ſo did the <hi>Tories;</hi> and as
<hi>Laud</hi>'s Faction ſtigmatized all others (except Papiſts) which were
not of their Faction, with the Name of <hi>Puritans,</hi> ſo did the <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
all other but Papiſts, with the Name of <hi>Whigs.</hi> But herein
the <hi>Tories</hi> in this Reign had a great Advantage above the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive-men
in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's Reign; for this Prince was
of a more parſimonious Nature, not at all becoming ſo great
a Prince, and had not one third of the Revenue which his
Son had, who profuſely ſcatter'd it amongſt his Minions and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites:
and ſure it will ſet an ill Character upon his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to have it left upon Record by what ſtrange ways to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Juſtice, he made himſelf a Drudg to his Favourites
to get Money from his Subjects to ſupport them; whilſt he
became a Penſioner to the <hi>French</hi> King himſelf, and was ſo
looſe in all his Leagues which he made with all other Princes
and States.</p>

After the Popiſh Plot broke out, and the King had diſſolved
the Long Parliament, the whole <hi>Genius</hi> of the Nation became
quite altered, as plainly appeared in their Election of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

their Quality were equal to any Houſe of Commons that ever was

                  <p>However the <hi>Tories</hi> were balked of the Expectation of their

                     <hi>Everard</hi> acquaints ſeveral with what <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> had ſaid, and

                  <p>Upon the <hi>22d</hi> Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> came to the Place appointed, but
Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> did not: there <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> gave <hi>Everard</hi>
Inſtructions, That the King and all the Royal Family muſt be
traduced to be Popiſhly and Arbitrarily affected from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
that King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt had a hand in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion;
and that King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second did countenance the
ſame by preferring <hi>Fitz-Gerald, Fitz-Patrick,</hi> and <hi>Mont-Garret,</hi>
who were in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion; that the Act forbidding the
calling the King a Papiſt, was to ſtop Peoples Mouths, when he
ſhould encline to further Popery, which appeared by his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſo cloſely to the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Intereſt, and hindering him
from being proceeded againſt in Parliament, and hindering the
Officers put in by the Duke, to be caſt out; and for that the
Privy-Counſellors and Juſtices of the Peace which were for the
Proteſtant Intereſt, were turned out of all Places of Truſt; and
that it was as much in the Peoples Power to depoſe a Popiſh Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor
as a Popiſh Succeſſor; and ſeeing there were no Hopes the
Parliament, when they ſhould meet at <hi>Oxford,</hi> could do any Good,
the People were bound to provide for themſelves.</p>
                  <p>After this, <hi>Everard</hi> and <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> agreed to meet there the
next Day; and in the mean time <hi>Everard</hi> ſent a Letter to Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Waller</hi> to meet there, and be concealed, to take notice of the
Paſſages: Sir <hi>William</hi> came, and was ſecretly placed by <hi>Everard;</hi>
but before Sir <hi>William</hi> was ſo placed, <hi>Everard</hi> gave him two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of the Inſtructions which <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> gave <hi>Everard</hi> to draw
up into a Libel, which Sir <hi>William</hi> marked.</p>
                  <p>Soon after <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> came and enquired of <hi>Everard</hi> what he
had done; who anſwered, he had drawn two Copies of the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and prayed <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> to ſee how he liked them: <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>
altered one of them, yet thought it not full enough, but
would have it fair wrote out for the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador's Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.
After that, <hi>Everard</hi> deſired <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> to give him his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
in Writing, in which Paper <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> wrote, <hi>That it
was in the Peoples Power to depoſe a Popiſh Poſſeſſor as well as Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor,</hi>
and other treaſonable Heads. And next Day <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>
came to <hi>Everard</hi> for a Copy fair written out, which was delivered
to <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> who promiſed <hi>Everard</hi> a Recompence, which was
to be the Entrance into the Buſineſs; but <hi>Everard</hi> ſhould be
brought into the Cabal, where ſeveral Proteſtants and Parliament-Men
were to give an Account to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador of what
was tranſacted. But before <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was to receive the Libel
back, he was to go to my Lord <hi>H</hi>—of <hi>Eſcrick.</hi>

Before this, <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> had received of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth

Mrs. <hi>Wall</hi> ſaid; which <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> purſued ſo well, that my Lord
waited ſeveral times upon the Dutcheſs, and found the King there;
and the Night before my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Sentence, <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>
came to my Lord from the King, and told him, that the King
would take it as a great Reſignation of my Lord to the King's Will

had three Months before his Apprehenſion been with the
King, and acquainted him that he was in Purſuit of a Plot, which
much related to his Majeſty's Perſon and Government; which the
King did countenance, and gave him ſome Money.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> acquainted the King with the Particulars he

                  <p>But Sir <hi>William</hi> was no ſooner gone, but Sir <hi>William</hi> ſaid he

                  <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> was as forward in taking <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> as before

                  <p>The Commons ſpent the three firſt Days in chooſing their Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

ſo that it was <hi>Thurſday</hi> the twenty fourth of <hi>March</hi> before they
entred upon any Buſineſs, and being diſſolved upon the <hi>Monday</hi>
following, they could make but little Progreſs upon the four
Particulars aforeſaid; and each of them was ſo green, that
the Court would not endure much Enquiry into any one of
them.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Debate of <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Buſineſs, one of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
reported how that one <hi>Hubert</hi> had confeſſed that he had
fired the City of <hi>London,</hi> upon which the Houſe reſolved to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
him next Morning, but before the Houſe ſat next Morning,
<hi>Hubert</hi> was hanged to prevent it; and they remembred there was
a Deſign to have tried the Popiſh Lords in the Tower by Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to prevent which the Commons exhibited general Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
againſt them, with that Succeſs that the Lords were never
tried upon Indictments, and the Judges gave their Opinions they
could not.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Commons ordered an Impeachment of <hi>Fitz-Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
upon <hi>Friday</hi> the twenty fifth of <hi>March,</hi> and ordered Sir <hi>Lionel
Jenkins</hi> to carry it up to the Lords, who at firſt refuſed it, ſaying,
<hi>The ſending of me upon this Meſſage reflects upon my Maſter the King,
and do what you will I will not go.</hi> Hereupon ſeveveral moved to
call him to the Bar, and ſeveral Speeches were made of his Offence;
but at laſt he relented, and carried up the Impeachment to the
Lords, but the Lords threw it out.</p>
                  <p>But the Lords having thrown out the Impeachment, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
the next Day being <hi>Saturday</hi> the twenty ſixth, ran high in
their Debates upon it: One ſaid, this was to have no further uſe
of a Parliament, but to ſerve a preſent Purpoſe: Another ſaid,
Indictments were brought againſt the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> yet
that was no Impediment againſt their Impeachment in the
Lords Houſe; and the laſt Day of the laſt Seſſions of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Lords accepted an Impeachment of the Lord Chief
Juſtice <hi>Scroggs;</hi> and that this Denial of Juſtice by the Lords,
was greater than my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi>'s Denial of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Preſentments from the Grand Inqueſt of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> by how
much the Commons of Parliament are the great Inqueſt of

of which <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> is accuſed, and the Commons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
him, and the Lords ſay, <hi>We will not hear it;</hi> and that if it
were not for the Lords, <hi>Fitz-Harris might have diſcovered all the
Conſpiracy, and the Proteſtant Religion might have been ſaved;</hi> and
therefore moved, <hi>That the denying this Impeachment, tends to the

Subverſion of the Conſtitution of the Parliament, and of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another ſaid, That this was a Confirmation of the Deſign to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the King, and the Duke conſenting to deſtroy his own Brother,
and our King; and therefore moved, <q>That if any Judg, Juſtice
or Jury proceed upon <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> and he be found Guilty,
That the Houſe would declare them guilty of his Murder, and
Betrayers of the Rights of the Commons of <hi>England:</hi>
                     </q> to which
was added upon the Motion of Sir <hi>W. J.</hi> 
                     <q>or that any Inferiour
Court ſhall proceed,</q> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was paſſed.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon of theſe Votes were, That if <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> were tried
upon an Indictment, he muſt have been tried ſingly upon the Fact,
whether he were guilty or not of contriving and diſperſing the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
but upon an Impeachment the Commons might enquire into
the whole Conſpiracy.</p>

the Parliament, and immediately took Coach and drove to <hi>Windſor,</hi>
leaving both Houſes in an Amaze, and the City of <hi>Oxford</hi> in a Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If it were Sir</hi> William Jones <hi>who wrote the</hi> juſt and modeſt Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of the two laſt Parliaments, <hi>viz. the laſt</hi> Weſtminſter Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>and this at</hi> Oxford, pag. 393. <hi>he ſays,</hi> The Peers at <hi>Oxford</hi>
were ſo wholly ignorant of the Council, that they never thought of a
Diſſolution, till they heard it pronounced; <hi>yet the Dutcheſs of</hi> Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
<hi>publiſhed the News at St.</hi> James'<hi>s many hours before it was
done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Nation, as well as the Parliament and City of <hi>Oxford,</hi>
were amazed at this Diſſolution and Manner of it; they were not
leſs with the Declaration that followed it, which though the King
did not communicate to the Council till <hi>Friday</hi> the eighth of
<hi>April,</hi> yet the next Page ſays, <hi>Monſieur Barillon,</hi> the <hi>French Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,</hi>
read it to a Gentleman upon the fifth of <hi>April</hi> before,
and demanded his Opinion of it, which the <hi>Embaſſador</hi> might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
remember becauſe of the great Liberty the Gentleman took in
ridiculing it to his Face.</p>
                  <p>It's obſervable that that Declaration was printed in <hi>French</hi> as well
as <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and many <hi>Galliciſms</hi> in it, and particularly, <hi>That it
was a Matter extreamly ſenſible to us,</hi> which was a Form of ſpeaking
peculiar to the <hi>French,</hi> and unknown to any other Nation.</p>
                  <p>The Subſtance of the Declaration contained the Diſſatisfaction
the King took at the two <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Parliaments, that they gave
him no ſutable Return to ſupport the Alliances which he had made
for the General Peace of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> nor for the further Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
into the Plot; nor for the Preſervation of <hi>Tangier;</hi> and for
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:60932:289"/>
their Votes, <q>That no Man ſhould lend any Money upon any
Branches of the Revenue, or buy, or pay any Tally of Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
upon any part of the King's Revenue. (This was not
ſo, for the Commons reſtrained them to the Cuſtom, Exciſe,
and Chimney-money given for other Ends; ſee the Votes) that
they paſſed a Vote, <hi>That the proſecuting of Proteſtant Diſſenters
was a Grievance to the Subject,</hi>
                     </q> &amp;c. by which they aſſumed to
themſelves a Power of ſuſpending Laws; <q>So the Commons
might do any other Law found by Experience to be grievous
and dangerous to the Subject, and muſt do ſo in order to repeal
ſuch Laws; and did not the King do ſo twice before by his
Declaration of Indulgence, though to a contrary End to what
the Commons intended?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That theſe Proceedings cauſed him to diſſolve that Parliament,
and to aſſemble another at <hi>Oxford,</hi> who had warning given them of
the Errors of the former, and were required to make the Law of
the Land their Rule; and adding, that he would not depart from
what he had formerly declared concerning the Succeſſion, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
he was ready to hearken to any Expedients by which the
Religion eſtabliſhed might be preſerved, yet the Monarchy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;
<hi>viz. How to preſerve Fire and Water mingled together:
and was not the Monarchy of</hi> Scotland <hi>preſerved, though his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
reigned twenty Years in</hi> Scotland <hi>while his Mother was alive,
without her, and ſo continued after her Death?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That no Expedient would be entertained but a total Excluſion;</hi>
nor could be, nor did the King ever propound any, how otherwiſe the
eſtabliſhed Religion might be preſerved.</p>
                  <p>That the Buſineſs of <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was carried to that Extremity,
that there were no hopes of a Reconciliation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and put the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
out of a Capacity of tranſacting Buſineſs: it was upon <hi>Friday</hi>
the twenty ſixth of <hi>March,</hi> the Commons ſent up the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> and there were but <hi>Saturday</hi> and <hi>Sunday</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this and the Diſſolution of the Parliament, and the Houſes
ſat not on <hi>Sunday,</hi> ſo that the King's no Hopes (or indeed Fears)
of a Reconciliation were very ſudden; <q>Why might not the
Lords, if they had been permitted to have ſat upon Conferences
with the Commons, and hearing their Reaſon, have altered their
Reſolutions, which is uſual? and it ſeems this Reſolution of the
Lords was very ſudden, and admitted of no great Debate, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Impeachment of <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> and the ſame Day to throw
it out,</q> which cauſed him to put an end to that Parliament.</p>
                  <p>However the King ſays, that notwithſtanding the Malice of ill
Men, who laboured to perſwade the People that he intended to
lay aſide the Uſe of Parliaments, he declared that no Irregularity
in Parliament ſhould make him out of love with them, and that
he was reſolved to have frequent Parliaments <hi>(yet lived near four
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:60932:290"/>
Years after, and never called another)</hi> and in the Intervals would
uſe his utmoſt endeavours to extirpate Popery, and redreſs the
Grievances of his Subjects (the truth of this will beſt appear
hereafter.</p>
                  <p>This Declaration, <hi>which carries the Title of his Majeſty's Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to all his loving Subjects,</hi> was ordered to be read in all the
Churches of <hi>England;</hi> but if the Matter of it were ſo ſurprizing
and amazing to the Nation, the Manner of it was not leſs. For
never any King of <hi>England</hi> before, as King, no not this King's
Father or Grandfather, ever ſpake to his Subjects, but either perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
in Parliament, or under the Broad Seal of <hi>England:</hi> Whereas
this Declaration is only Signed <hi>Francis Gwyn,</hi> it might have been as
well <hi>Edward Coleman,</hi> and the Subjects as much obliged to have
taken notice of the one as of the other.</p>
                  <p>And the Reaſon is twofold, one, That the Chancellor or Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is reſponſible if he puts the Seal to any Declaration or Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not warranted by Law; and therefore my Lord Chancellor
<hi>Finch</hi>'s <hi>Sagacity,</hi> in not putting the Seal to this Declaration, was as
apparent as his <hi>Veracity,</hi> which he would not expoſe in ſeconding
the King's Speech at the opening the laſt <hi>Weſtminſter Parliament:</hi>
And the other is to avoid all Impoſtures and Cheats, which might
otherwiſe be impoſed upon the Nation, under the Name of the
King.</p>
                  <p>That we may take a better View of the reſt of this King's
Reign (if it be worthy to be called ſo) it's fit we look into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and ſee what's doing there for the Diſcovery of the Popiſh
Plot; but it's fit to look a little back, and take notice that the King
in his Speech at the opening of the Second <hi>Weſtminſter Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
told them that to take away all room for any Jealouſy of his
not proſecuting the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, he had ſent his
Brother beyond Sea; but having by the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuppreſſed the <hi>Kirk Party</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he fairly ſends for the Duke
of <hi>York</hi> back again, and from an Exile made him Vice-Roy or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where all things lay open for him to proſecute
his Deſigns as he pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>When the Duke came into <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> was one
of the firſt that waited upon him: The Earl's Story will better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
if firſt you take his Character.</p>
                  <p>He was Son of the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> after made Marqueſs by
King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, who ſo preferred him, to take him off
from heading the <hi>Kirk Party,</hi> and thereby to oblige him to become
of the King's ſide; which had no Effect, for the Marqueſs, above
any other of the <hi>Scotiſh Nobility,</hi> was a moſt zealous Aſſertor of
the <hi>Kirk's</hi> Power, and was the Head of them when <hi>Montroſs</hi> took
up Arms againſt them; but though the Marqueſs was moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
in it, yet it no ways abated his Zeal to the <hi>Kirk,</hi> nor was
he leſs eſteemed by them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="569" facs="tcp:60932:290"/>
When <hi>Cromwel</hi> had overthrown Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and taken him
Priſoner, who came into <hi>England,</hi> not to eſtabliſh the National
League and Covenant, but to deliver King <hi>Charles</hi> out of Priſon:
The zealous <hi>Kirk Party</hi> were highly offended at it, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
of <hi>Argyle</hi> was the principal Agent to call <hi>Cromwel</hi> into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to ſuppreſs the <hi>Hamiltonian Faction,</hi> and to eſtabliſh the <hi>Kirk;</hi>
which <hi>Cromwel</hi> then did (though he undid it ſoon after) and for
this the Marqueſs was, the firſt Year after the King's Reſtoration,
condemned and executed for High Treaſon, upon which he loſt all
his Honours as well as his Eſtate.</p>
                  <p>But in all the Marqueſs's Actions, his Son, the Lord <hi>Lorn,</hi> run
counter to him, and when this King <hi>Charles</hi> was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he
was of all others the moſt obſequious to him; and afterward when
<hi>Middleton</hi> made ſome Incurſions into <hi>Scotland</hi> for the King, <hi>Lorn</hi>
was moſt aſſiſting in them: Hereupon, after the Marqueſs was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
and executed, King <hi>Charles</hi> reſtored his Son to all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Eſtate and Honours except that of Marqueſs.</p>
                  <p>Afterward the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> continued conſtant in his Integrity
to the King in all his Civil Affairs, and was moſt zealous and
forward in ſuppreſſing Tumults, and Field-Conventicles; ſo that
before the Duke came into <hi>Scotland,</hi> the King had ſo entire a
Confidence in the Earl, that he gloried that in thirty Years (which
muſt be computed from the King's going into <hi>Scotland</hi> in 1650)
he never received one Frown from the King: how he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſuch a prejured Traitor after the Duke's coming into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
is now to be enquired into.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> was one of the Lords of the Articles,
and by the Duke made one of the Committee for the Articles of
Religion, which by the Cuſtom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by the King's
Inſtruction, was to be the firſt thing treated of.</p>
                  <p>In this Committee, an Act was prepared for ſecuring the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, which approved the Confeſſion of Faith; and
alſo the Act containing the Coronation Oath, to be taken by all
the Kings and Regents of <hi>Scotland,</hi> before their entry to exerciſe
their Government.</p>
                  <p>This Act, as drawn, was leſs binding to the Succeſſor of the
Crown, as to his own Profeſſion; yet did oblige as ſtrongly the
Maintenance of the Proteſtant Religion in the publick Profeſſion
by all others, as before, and added a Teſt to be taken by all in
publick Emploiments, to exclude the Popiſh Party out of them:
and becauſe in caſe of a Popiſh Succeſſor, all Fines and Forfeitures
by Papiſts would be inſignificant, <hi>viz.</hi> remitted, this intended
Act did ordain, that ſuch Fines and Forfeitures, one half ſhould
be to the Informers, the other to charitable Uſes.</p>
                  <p>But this Act being ſo contrary to the Duke's Deſign, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of Religion was diſcharged from meeting again; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:60932:291"/>
ſhort Act was brought into Parliament, ratifying all former
Acts for ſecuring the Proteſtant Religion: ſo that in this firſt Act
the Duke purſued not his Inſtructions, but went contrary to them,
and to the Cuſtom of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the paſſing this Act the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> propoſed that all Acts
againſt Popery might be added, which was oppoſed by the King's
Advocate, and ſome of the Clergy; yet ſeconded by Sir <hi>George
Lockhart,</hi> and the Preſident of the Seſſions, it paſſed without a
Vote: but ſuch was the Jealouſy of the Parliament, that this did
not ſecure the eſtabliſhed Religion, that ſeveral of the Members
deſired other Additions and Acts, which the Duke in open Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
promiſed, when Time and Opportunity offered, ſhould paſs;
but when at any time this was propoſed, the Teſt was obtruded.</p>
                  <p>If the Parliament were ſo zealous to ſecure the eſtabliſhed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the Duke was not leſs to ſecure the Succeſſion of the
Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhrewdly ſtruck at in <hi>England,</hi> in the very
Perſon of the Duke; and to that end a Bill was brought in and
paſſed, wherein it was declared High Treaſon to affirm that the
Succeſſion of the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> can be altered from the next
of Proximity of Blood: but how agreeable this was to the Title
of the <hi>Bruces</hi> and <hi>Stuarts,</hi> who had no Title to the Succeſſion of
the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> but by Act of Parliament, has already been
ſhewed; and how diſagreeable this Act was to the Duke's Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's
Succeſſion to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> without any Act of
Parliament, let any Man judg.</p>
                  <p>This Act was not only thus contrary to the Laws and Uſages of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> but the Act is equivocal, if not contradictory to the
Duke's Deſign: for there is a difference between the next Heir and
the next in Proximity of Blood; as if a Man had ſeveral Sons, and
the eldeſt has a Son or Daughter, his Father living, and after his
Father dies, his eldeſt Son's Son is Heir, and his other Sons and
Daughters are next in Proximity of Blood; the Heir being a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in Blood further removed from the common Anceſtor, than
his Uncles or Aunts: and this was the caſe of <hi>Richard</hi> II. of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
Son of the Black Prince, <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's Eldeſt Son,
who ſucceeded to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> though his Uncles, the
Dukes of <hi>Clarence, Lancaſter, York</hi> and <hi>Cambridg,</hi> were nearer of
Blood to <hi>Edward</hi> the Third.</p>
                  <p>This Act for the Succeſſion of the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by another called the Teſt, as contradictory to it ſelf, as
contrary to the Act of Succeſſion, to be taken by all Perſons in
publick Truſt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> wherein they ſolemnly Swear, in the
Preſence of the Eternal God, whom they invoke as Judg and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their ſincere Intention of this their Oath,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That they own and profeſs the true Proteſtant Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Confeſſion of Faith, recorded in the firſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:60932:291"/>
of King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth, and believe the ſame to be
founded on, and agreeable to the Written Word of God: That
they will adhere thereto, and endeavour to educate their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
therein, and never conſent to any Change or Alteration
contrary thereto; and renounce all Popiſh and Fanatical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
inconſiſtent with the ſaid Proteſtant Religion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Faith. And by this their ſolemn Oath they Swear,
That King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second is the only Supream Governour
of this Realm, over all Perſons, and in all Cauſes, as well Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
as Civil; and renounce all Foreign Juriſdiction of the
Pope, or any other Perſon: and promiſe to bear true Faith and
Allegiance to the King, his Heirs and Lawful Succeſſors, and to
their Power to defend all their Rights and Prerogatives. And
by this their ſolemn Oath they Swear, They judg it unlawful
for Subjects, upon pretence of Reformation, or any Pretence
whatſoever, to enter into any Covenants or Leagues, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in any Council to treat of any Matter of State Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
or Civil, without his Majeſty's ſpecial Command, or
expreſs Licence; or to take up Arms againſt the King, or thoſe
commiſſionated by him: That they will never riſe in Arms, or
enter into ſuch Covenants or Aſſemblies: That there lies no
Obligation upon them by the National Covenant, or the ſolemn
League or Covenant, or any other way to endeavour any Change
or Alteration of the Government, either of Church or State,
as by Law eſtabliſhed: and promiſe and ſwear to the utmoſt of
their Power, to maintain the King's Juriſdiction againſt all dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and as they ſhall anſwer it before God: and that they took
this Oath in the true and genuine Senſe and Meaning of the
Words, without any Equivocation, Mental Reſervation, or Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and never to accept of any Diſpenſation from any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
So God help them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe two Acts you may obſerve the <hi>Scotiſh Temper,</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were natural, or in contradiction to the <hi>Kirk-Party,</hi> I will
not ſay, nor how much higher it flew than the <hi>Tory</hi> in <hi>England)</hi> but
becauſe of the extraordinarineſs of theſe two Acts, it's fit to make
ſome Reflections upon them. Such another Law as that of the
Succeſſion, was made the twenty firſt of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, in
the Caſe of <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> which laſted not longer than the next
Year after, when the Law was not only repealed, but <hi>Henry</hi> the
Fourth ſucceeded contrary to it; whereas this Law continued for
above eight Years after, when it not only loſt its Force, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Face appeared in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſo continues in ſpight of this
Law. Now from this treaſonable Law, let us make ſome Remarks
upon this ranting, ſwearing Law, called the <hi>Teſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have ſaid elſewhere, that all Oaths are aſſertory of the
Truth of Things, Speech and Actions in time paſt, or promiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:60932:292"/>
to do or forbear to do ſome Act in time to come: and now let's
conſider what is Truth, and the End of an aſſertory Oath.</p>
                  <p>Truth is proper to intellectual and reaſonable Creatures; and is
either the apprehenſion of intelligible Beings, as God, a Law, the
Soul, Time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which can never be the Objects of Senſe, and
of the Cauſes and Conſequences of Intentions, Speech and Action,
for Senſe is not of Futurity, but of preſent Things and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
the Conſequence or Inference will be whether good or bad,
juſt or unjuſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> However all intelligible Beings, and the
Cauſes of Things and Actions are ever aſſumed, not ſworn to; and
if another does not nor will aſſent to them, ſwearing to the Truth
of them will be to no purpoſe: So it is of the Conſequence of
Speech and Actions; if another be not convinced from the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of ſuch Conſequence or Inference, ſwearing it to be ſo will
never do it.</p>
                  <p>But though ſenſible Things, Speech and Actions, are perceived
by the Senſes, and underſtood to exiſt or be, yet theſe are known
to be by ſome, and not by others; and in Juſtice and Judgment,
the end of an aſſertory Oath is to inform the Judg of the Truth
of what a Man knows, which otherwiſe might be concealed: and
here I ſay, that as God's Name in Religion, Piety and Juſtice, is
to be invoked, when it is not in vain, but for God's Honour; ſo
otherwiſe to uſe or abuſe his ſacred Name in vain, is diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God, and makes it vile and contemptible. Now let's ſee
how the ranting Swearing of this <hi>Teſt</hi> agrees with the Religion and
Obligation of an Oath, and obſerve it in its Particulars or Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It begins,</p>
                  <p>I ſolemnly ſwear in the Preſence of the Eternal God, whom I invoke
as Judg and Witneſs of this my ſincere Intention of this my Oath,
that I own and profeſs the true Proteſtant Religion contained in the
Confeſſion of Faith, recorded in the firſt Year of King <hi>James</hi> the
Sixth.</p>
                  <p>So that here is a moſt horrible Swearing, and Invocation of God's
ſacred Name, and yet neither an aſſertory nor promiſſory Oath;
for an aſſertory Oath, is of ſome Act or Speech in time paſt,
which was tranſient, and not when the Oath was taken; and a
promiſſory Oath is of time to come: whereas in this Oath the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
ſwears in the preſent time he does own the Proteſtant Religion
recorded in the Confeſſion of Faith in the firſt Year of King <hi>James</hi>
the Sixth. I believe there is ſuch a Record, intituled, <hi>The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Faith,</hi> in the firſt Year of King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth, becauſe
<hi>Spotiſwood</hi> and other <hi>Scotiſh Authors</hi> ſay ſo: but to ſwear by the
Eternal God, that it contains the true Proteſtant Religion (when
the Name is not in it) is ſuch an implicite Faith as can ſcarce be
found in the moſt ſuperſtitious in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Chriſtian
Faith is a Belief of God's Revelations in the Scriptures; to which
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:60932:292"/>
if any add or dimniiſh, his Name ſhall be blotted out of the Book
of Life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18, 29. But where the <hi>Scots</hi> found their Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Faith in the firſt Year of King <hi>James, Knox</hi> no where tells,
tho he was the Founder of it.</p>
                  <p>And I believe the ſame to be agreeable to the Written Word of God.</p>
                  <p>But what need you ſwear by the Eternal God you do ſo? If
you demonſtrate or give the Reaſon of your Belief, which you
do not, this might convince another, which your Swearing never
will.</p>
                  <p>That I will adhere thereto, and endeavour to educate my Children
therein.</p>
                  <p>The more obſtinate Man you, and ſo much the worſe for your
Children.</p>
                  <p>And never conſent to any Change or Alterations thereto.</p>
                  <p>This might have been left out, for if you adhere to it, you
cannot conſent to any Change or Alteration.</p>
                  <p>And renounce all Popiſh and Fanatical Doctrines inconſiſtent with the
ſaid Proteſtant Religion, and Confeſſion of Faith.</p>
                  <p>I take a Renunciation to be a Diſclaimure of what was before;
ſo that if you renounce all Popiſh and Fanatical Doctrines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it
ſeems before you owned them: yet you neither tell what theſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
and Fanatical Doctrines are, or wherein they are inconſiſtent
with the Proteſtant Religion and Confeſſion of Faith; or how
you come to know ſo: and if you do not, it ill becomes you to
proſtitute God's ſacred Name, to ſwear to what you do not know.</p>
                  <p>And by this my ſolemn Oath I ſwear that King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second is
the only Supream Governour of this Realm, over all Perſons, and in
all Cauſes, as well Eccleſiaſtical as Civil.</p>
                  <p>By which of your Senſes do you know this, by your ſeeing,
ſmelling, touching or taſting? Or if it be by another's having told
you ſo, will you ſwear to whatever another tells you? Or if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Supream Governour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will you ſwear by the Eternal God he is
not ſo? or if King <hi>Charles</hi> ſhould be dead when you are ſwearing
this, which he may for ought you know, how long will you hold
of this Mind?</p>
                  <p>And that I renounce <hi>(what, again?)</hi> all foreign Juriſdiction of the
Pope, or any other Perſon.</p>
                  <p>If I cannot take your Word, I'll not think the better of it for
your ſwearing to it.</p>
                  <p>And promiſe to bear true Allegiance to the King, his Heirs, and
Lawful Succeſſors.</p>
                  <p>'Tis well if you hold long in this Mind; but before you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced

                  </p>
                  <p>Yet you neither declare what theſe Rights and Prerogatives are,

                  <p>And I judg it unlawful for Subjects, upon Pretence of Reformation,

                  <p>That I will never riſe in Arms, or enter into ſuch Covenants or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.</p>
                  <p>For all your ſwearing to this, yet I believe my Lord Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
will not truſt to your Oath, and the rather becauſe you were
ſo looſe to it in obſerving your ſolemn League and Covenant,
which you ſware with as ſervent Affection, as you now ſeem to
do to this, and with Hands and Heart lifted up to the moſt high
God.</p>
                  <p>That there lies no Obligation upon me by the National Covenant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Does there lie no Obligation upon you by the ſolemn League
and Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to endeavour any Change or Alteration in
Church or State? why, you as ſolemnly ſware that as this; and
by that you ſware to extirpate Prelacy, and here you ſwear ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to endeavour any Change of it. Or do you think you pleaſe
his Highneſs my Lord Commiſſioner herein, whoſe Buſineſs it is,
not only to make Alterations, but to ſubvert your Church and
State? And if you will make no Alterations in either, it will not
be long before you ſhall ſee Alterations made in both without
you.</p>
                  <p>And I promiſe and ſwear to maintain the King's Juriſdictions againſt

                     <pb n="575" facs="tcp:60932:293"/>
Why this again? For before you ſware to maintain all the
King's Rights and Prerogatives, and what does the King's Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
add to them? However you are very prodigal of your
Swearing; and if his Highneſs will not believe you for your Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before, you'll try how far he'll believe you now.</p>
                  <p>And that I take this Oath in the plain and genuine Senſe and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Words, without any Equivocation, Mental Reſervation, or
Evaſion, and never to accept of any Diſpenſation from any Creature.
<hi>So God help me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is well ſworn to interpret your Truth and Sincerity,
eſpecially when the whole Oath is Confuſion, Equivocation, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
and not one plain and intelligible Sentence in it.</p>
                  <p>In the Debates in Parliament for paſſing this Teſt, the Earl of
<hi>Argyle</hi> declared his Opinion, That as few Oaths as could be ſhould
be impoſed; and that the Oath of Allegiance and Declaration had
effectually debarred all Fanaticks of getting into any Places of
Truſt; and though ſome Papiſts had ſwallowed the Oath, yet a
Word or two of Addition to guard againſt them, was all he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>The Earl oppoſed the diſpenſing with the King's Sons and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
taking the <hi>Teſt,</hi> for that the King and People were of one
Religion, and hoped the Parliament would do nothing to looſe
what was faſt, nor open a Gap for the Royal Family to differ in
Religion; for their Example, if it once appeared to the People
to be honourable, would have more Followers than a Thouſand
others would have; and therefore wiſhed, if any Exception were,
it might be particular to his Highneſs: which the Duke oppoſing,
the Earl concluded, if it did paſs, it would do more hurt to the
Proteſtant Religion, than all the reſt of the Acts and many other
Acts would do good.</p>
                  <p>This Plainneſs of the Earl was the Cauſe of all that befel him,
as he was afterwards told by the Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> but the firſt
Appearance of the Duke's Diſpleaſure, was two Bills given in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, one by the Earl of <hi>Errol,</hi> the other by the King's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,
who acknowledged it to be done by Commandment, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
it was without his Line. Theſe ſtruck at the Earl's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
and Honours; only that of <hi>Errol</hi> was, that the Earl's Eſtate
might be liable to pay him and others for the Debts contracted
by his Father: The Advocate's Claim was to all his Heritable
Offices.</p>
                  <p>But the Duke being informed that a Judgment in this Caſe,
would have expoſed the Marqueſs of <hi>Huntley</hi>'s Eſtate, (who was
a zealous Papiſt) the Duke of his own Accord put a full Stop to
it; for he found, he ſaid, it did plainly impugn the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
and might be of ill Conſequence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="576" facs="tcp:60932:294"/>
After this the Parliament was adjourned, and a new Deſign
was to get a Commiſſion from the King, to review all the Earl's
Rights and heritable Offices, and to charge his Eſtate for more
than 'twas worth: Hereupon the Earl applied himſelf to the Duke
againſt ſuch a Commiſſion, and intreated him, that if any quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Right, his Caſe might be remitted to the ordinary Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories
according to the eſtabliſhed Laws of the Land; but this
was not granted, yet the Duke was pleaſed to allow the Earl time
to go into the Country to bring his Evidence, with a Promiſe no
Commiſſion ſhould paſs till the Earl's Return. But you'll ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than the Earl's Eſtate was deſigned.</p>
                  <p>For the Earl was no ſooner gone, but he and the Preſident of
the Seſſions were turned out of it: Hereupon the Earl wrote to
the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> the King's Secretary, praying leave to wait
upon the King, which he was pleaſed readily to grant; and upon
his Return to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> begg'd the ſame Favour of the Duke,
who told him he might not kiſs the King's Hand till he had taken
the <hi>Teſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here you may obſerve, the Teſt was not to be taken by any but
thoſe who bear Office, nor to be impoſed upon any before the Firſt
of <hi>January</hi> 1680, and this was about the Beginning of <hi>November</hi>
before: and the Earl being acquainted that one of the Clerks of
the Council was appointed to ſummon the Earl to the Council the
next Day, which he conceived to be to take the Teſt, he asked
the Duke, if with his Favour he might not have the Allowance
by the Act? The Duke told him no; and the Earl urged it again
in vain; all the Delay he could obtain was but till <hi>Thurſday</hi> the
third of <hi>November,</hi> the next Council-Day of Courſe: Then the
Earl ſaid, he was the leſs fond of the Teſt, becauſe he found ſome
who had refuſed it, were ſtill in Favour, and others, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter,
who had taken it, were turned out; at which his <hi>Highneſs
laught.</hi> But how comes your Highneſs, ſaid the Earl, to preſs
the Teſt ſo haſtily? Sure there are ſome things in it which your
Highneſs does not overmuch like. To which the Duke anſwered
angerly and in a Paſſion, moſt true, that the Teſt was brought
into Parliament <hi>without the Confeſſion of Faith;</hi> but the late Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
cauſed put in the <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> which makes it ſuch as <hi>no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Man can take it</hi> (which is a greater Contravention and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Teſt, than the Perjury and Treaſon charged upon the
Earl for them;) then the Earl replied, he had the more Reaſon to
adviſe.</p>
                  <p>In this Interval the Earl ſpake with the Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and
ſaw his Explanation of the Teſt, and that of the Biſhop of <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen,</hi>
and the Synod's Explanation of the Teſt, and the Explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it by the Synod and Clergy of <hi>Perth,</hi> and that of the Earl of
<hi>Queensberry;</hi> which as they differ all from one another, ſo were
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:60932:294"/>
they printed and made publick, and which you may read at large
in the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It's obſervable, that tho by the Teſt they ſwear the Confeſſion
of Faith, recorded in the firſt of King</hi> James <hi>the ſixth,</hi> To be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon and agreeable to the Word of God, and that they will never
conſent to any Change or Alteration thereto, and at laſt ſwear they
take it in the plain and genuine Senſe and Meaning of the Words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Equivocation; <hi>yet the Biſhop of</hi> Aberdeen, <hi>and the Synod,
in the</hi> 2d <hi>Article of their Explanation ſay,</hi> We do not hereby prejudg
the Churches Right to, and Power of making an Alteration in the ſaid
Confeſſion, as to the Ambiguity and obſcure Expreſſions thereof, or of
making a more unexceptionable Frame: <hi>and having made ſeveral
other Exceptions, the Sixth Article concludes,</hi> When we ſwear
that we take the Teſt in the plain and genuine Senſe of the Words,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> we underſtand it only ſo far as it does not contradict the Exceptions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Synod of</hi> Perth <hi>makes four explanatory Exceptions
to the Teſt, and the fifth concludes, When we ſwear in the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
and literal Senſe, we underſtand it</hi> ſo far as the Teſt is not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
or contradictory to the aforeſaid Exceptions; <hi>and before they
ſubſcribed this, they were allowed to inſert after the Oath,</hi> We
underwritten, do take this Oath, according to the Explanation made
by the Council, approved by his Majeſty's Letter, and do declare we
are no further bound by it.</p>
                  <p>Thus things ſtood with others, when the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> upon
Wedneſday the Second of <hi>November</hi> waited upon the Duke, and
humbly beſought him to decline his preſent taking of the Teſt:
but if his Highneſs would have a preſent Anſwer, he begg'd that
he would accept of the Earl's refuſing it in private, which the Duke
denied; then the Earl deſired he might go home and conſider,
and he would either give Satisfaction, or the time preſcribed by
the Act of Parliament would elapſe, and then he would go off in
Courſe and without Noiſe, which the Duke abſolutely refuſed:
upon which the Earl asked what good his appearing in Council to
refuſe (I think it ſhould have been reſide) there would do? to
which the Duke anſwered, he need not appear, but imploy ſome
Friend to ſpeak for him, and named one.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Earl drew a Letter to the Perſon the Duke named,
wherein he expreſt his conſtant Reſolution to continue a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
and loyal Subject, which were the true Ends of the Teſt:
but the Letter concluding a Delay of taking the Teſt <hi>(which no
honeſt Man,</hi> the Duke ſaid, <hi>could do)</hi> and the Duke having given
ſome Indication how little pleaſing that Office would be to him;
neither the Perſon named by the Duke, nor any Friend of the
Earl's would by any means accept of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="578" facs="tcp:60932:295"/>
But the Earl being adviſed that an Explanation of the Teſt
would be more acceptable, the Earl drew a ſhort one, and put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Pocket, but would not offer it till he knew the Duke's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
and being told by the Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> it would be very
kindly accepted, the Earl went into the Council-Chamber, and
with an audible Voice, read his Explanation of his taking the
Teſt, cloſe by the Duke, whereupon it was adminiſtred to him,
which the Duke accepted with a Smile, and commanded him to
take his Place, which at that time was next the Duke, and the
Duke ſpake ſeveral times privately to him, and always pleaſantly:
However the Earl was ſo cautious, that after he had made the
Explanation of the Teſt in Council, he would not communicate
it to any other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Earl's Explanation was,</hi> I have conſidered the Teſt, and I
am deſirous to give Obedience as far as I can. I'm confident the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
never intended any contradictory Oaths, therefore I think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
Man can explain it but for himſelf; accordingly I take it as far as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
is conſiſtent with it ſelf, and the Proteſtant Religion: And I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that I mean not to bind up my ſelf in my Station, and in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Way, to wiſh and endeavour in a lawful Way, any Alteration I
think to the Advantage of the Church and State, not repugnant to the
Proteſtant Religion and my Loyalty; and this I underſtand as part of
my Oath.</p>
                  <p>And as the Earl was ſo cautious in not communicating his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation
of the Teſt, ſo was it never ſo much as charged upon
him that he ever diſparaged the Teſt, or diſſwaded any other from
taking it: However this muſt be the Grand Work for his, and
only his Deſtruction; for, as was ſaid, many others had explained
their taking the Teſt, much more contradictory than the Earl had
done, and printed and publiſhed their Explanations.</p>
                  <p>Next Morning the Earl waited upon the Duke, expecting his
Yeſterday's Countenance, and beginning to ſpeak, the Duke inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
him, and ſaid he was not pleaſed with his Explanation:
the Earl anſwered he did not give it till the Duke allowed him:
the Duke acknowledged the Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> had told him, that
he intended an Explanation, but the Duke ſaid, he thought it
would have been a ſhort one, ſuch as the Earl of <hi>Queensberry</hi>'s:
to which the Earl anſwered, he heard what he ſaid, and that the
Earl ſaid the ſame thing in private to him; and the Earl going on
to ſay more, the Duke interrupted him, ſaying, <hi>It's paſt with you,
but it ſhall paſs ſo with no other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Day after the Earl was ſummoned again to the Council,
to take the Teſt as one of the Lords of the Treaſury, and an
extraordinary Council was held at the Abbey: Where, ſo ſoon as
they were met, the Teſt was tendred to the Earl, ſaying as before,
when the Earl of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> ſtanding behind the Duke, and never
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:60932:295"/>
heard to ſpeak in Council before, with Clamour asked what the
Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> had ſaid? which the Duke told him; upon which
<hi>Roxburgh</hi> deſired that what the Earl had ſaid the Day before
might be repeated, which at firſt he declined, till he was peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily
commanded by the Duke; the Earl then ſaid, he had a Note
of what he had ſaid in his Pocket, which the Duke commanded him
to produce, which he did, and was willing to ſign it; but the new
Lord Preſident (now made Chancellour) and the new made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter,
did not agree whether the Earl ſhould then ſign it, the
Treaſon not appearing, as when they talked of it in private: So
the Earl was bid to withdraw, and when he was called in, he was
poſitively required to ſign the Paper he had given in; to which
the Earl anſwered, that if the Words did pleaſe them, as when
they were given in, he would; but if there were the leaſt Matter
of Diſpleaſure in them, he would forbear: whereupon he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
and being called in, he was told he had not given the
Satisfaction required in the Act of Parliament in taking the Teſt,
and therefore could not ſit in Council: to which the Earl anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he judged all the Parliament meant was to exclude the
Refuſers of the Takers of the Teſt from their Places, to which he
ſubmitted, and that as he had ſerved his Majeſty faithfully within
doors, ſo he was reſolved to do without doors, and ſo made his
Obeiſance and went out. But now the Earl ſaw his Eſtate, Life
and Honour were ſtruck at, he communicated theſe Secrets to
ſome for his own Vindication.</p>
                  <p>Upon Saturday the fifth of <hi>November,</hi> the Earl waited upon
the Duke again, and told him he was ſtrangely ſurprized that the
ſaying <hi>he could not bind himſelf up in a lawful way,</hi> &amp;c. as contained
in the Paper, was looked upon as a Crime, when as he had ſaid
the ſame to him before without any Offence, and that the Duke then
ſaid <hi>they were unneceſſary Words, that the Earl ſcrupled needleſly, and
that he was not tied up by that Oath as he imagined;</hi> and that, after
a little Pauſe, the Duke told him, <hi>you have cheated your ſelf, you
have taken the Teſt:</hi> to which the Earl anſwered, then he hoped his
Highneſs was ſatisfied; but the Duke, after ſome other Expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
told the Earl, <hi>That he and ſome others had a Deſign to bring
Trouble upon a Handful of poor Catholicks that would live peaceably
however they were uſed, but that it ſhould light upon others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Deſign appears barefac'd: for, would you think it,
the Earl having delivered the Explanation of his taking the Teſt
by the Duke's peremptory Command, this is interpreted a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
of it; and upon Tueſday the eighth of <hi>November,</hi> a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
was called without calling the Earl to it, and an Order was ſent
by one of the Clerks of the Council to the Earl, that before 12
a Clock next Day, he ſhould enter himſelf a Priſoner in the Caſtle
of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and a Warrant was ſent to the Deputy Governour to
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:60932:296"/>
keep him Priſoner, wherein the Word <hi>Sure firmance,</hi> tho fairly
writ, was ſtruck out: The Earl obeyed, and by himſelf alone, in
a Hackney Coach, rendred himſelf a Priſoner accordingly: And
now you'll ſee how abſolutely in this deputed Authority the Duke
demeaned himſelf without Reſerve; what then might be expected
from him in Caſe he ſhould become King?</p>
                  <p>The Earl ſome Days after he had rendred himſelf Priſoner, wrote
to the Duke, telling him how he had obeyed his Highneſs and
Council's Order in rendring himſelf a Priſoner, and how that he
wrote no ſooner, leſt he might be thought too impatient of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
which appeared to be the Effects of high Diſpleaſure,
which he hoped he no ways deſerved, and was reſolved to continue
all Duty and Obedience to his Majeſty and Highneſs, and begg'd to
know what Satisfaction was expected, where and how he might
live in his Highneſs's Favour: to which no Anſwer was returned,
but a Summons charging the Earl with <hi>leaſing making, and depraving
of Laws:</hi> And after another Summons came out, and publiſhed,
with Sound of Trumpet, charging the Earl with Perjury and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
but when it was told the Duke that ſuch a Proceſs threatned
the Earl's <hi>Life and Fortune,</hi> the Duke ſaid, <hi>Life and Fortune! God
forbid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The very Day, <hi>November</hi> the eighth, that the Council ordered
the Earl to render himſelf a Priſoner, the Council ſent a Letter to
the King, wherein they ſent the Earl's Explanation of his taking
the Teſt, and how they had commanded his Majeſty's Advocate to
raiſe a Purſuit againſt the Earl upon it; yet expecting his Majeſty's
Commands for their further Proſecution of it.</p>
                  <p>But the King might command what he pleaſed, his Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and Council would do what they would with it: for before
any Return of their Letter, they cauſed the King's Advocate to
exhibit an Indictment againſt the Earl, upon the Points of <hi>ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and depraving:</hi> And after the Return of the King's Letter,
they ordered a new Indictment againſt the Earl, containing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the former Points, the Crimes of <hi>Treaſon and Perjury,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they acquainted the King with it.</p>
                  <p>The Earl thus mewed up, that he might not give any Offence,
twice petitions the Duke and Council, that Sir <hi>George Lockhart</hi>
might be his Advocate to plead his Defence, yet both times refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
the Reaſon of theſe Petitions were, that without Leave none
would dare to plead the Earl's Cauſe, for fear of the King's Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
However, by the Act, 11 <hi>Jac. 6. Cap. 90. It is the undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Privilege of all Subjects accuſed for any Crimes, to provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Advocates, to defend their Lives, Honours, and Lands, againſt
whatſoever Accuſation:</hi> So by the 11 <hi>Jac. 6. c.</hi> 90. it is declared,
<hi>That in caſe Advocates refuſe, the Judges may compel them.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Earl drew up a Letter of Attorney, conſtituting <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:60932:296"/>
Dunbar</hi> to require Sir <hi>George Lockhart</hi> to plead for him, which
the Duke no ſooner heard, but ſaid, <hi>If Sir</hi> George Lockhart
<hi>plead for the Earl, he ſhall never plead for my Brother nor me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Earl might ſet his Heart at reſt, for whatever Counſel
he had, his Caſe was fore-judged, before heard: However, for
forms ſake, upon the Twelfth of <hi>December</hi> 1681, the Earl was
brought by a Guard of Soldiers before the Juſtice Court, where
the Earl of <hi>Queensberry</hi> was Chief Juſtice General, and the Lords
<hi>Narin, Collingtoun, Newtoun,</hi> and <hi>Hirkhouſe,</hi> Lords Juſticiary ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in Judgment. It is inconſiſtent with the Deſign of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
to ſet down the Earl's Speech at large, and the long and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Pleadings of Sir <hi>George Lockhart,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Dalrymple,</hi>
for the Earl's Defence, and the King's Advocates pleading againſt
the Earl, and their Doubling's and Tripling's; yet it's fit to ſay
ſomething of them, and leave the Reader at Liberty to read them
at large in the Earl's Caſe, which is printed.</p>
                  <p>The Earl in his Defence only claims the Privilege of the meaneſt
Subject, tho under an ill Character, to explain his own Words in
the moſt benign Senſe, and how ſtrange and impoſſible it would
be to believe he intended any thing but what was ſutable to the
Principles of his Religion and Loyalty, though he did not expreſs
himſelf at all.</p>
                  <p>Then he enlarged, how from his Youth he had made it his
Buſineſs to ſerve his Majeſty faithfully, conſtantly, and to his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
eſpecially in all times of Difficulty, and never joined or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with any Intereſt or Party contrary to his Majeſty's Authority,
and ſo, that he never received a Frown from his Majeſty theſe
thirty Years; and that even in this Parliament, how he had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Readineſs to ſerve the King and Royal Family in ſo vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
aſſerting the Lineal Succeſſion of the Crown, and in offering
Supplies to his Majeſty and Succeſſor; and that he had always
kept his Tenants in Obedience to his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>How ſtrange then is it, that Words ſpoken for the clearing his
own Conſcience, ſhould be wreſted into Treaſon, eſpecially where
the ſame was done before by many <hi>Orthodox Clergy,</hi> whole Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
Synods, and ſome Biſhops? ſo that an eminent Biſhop took
the Pains to write a Treatiſe that was read over in Council,
and allowed to be printed, and a Copy given to him, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
all the Expreſſions he is charged for, and many more may be
ſtretched to a worſe Senſe; and having wiſhed all Happineſs to
the King, and a Continuance of the Lineal Succeſſion, left his
Defence to his Advocates, Sir <hi>George Lockhart</hi> and Sir <hi>John Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rymple:</hi>
then ſeveral Letters from General <hi>Middleton</hi> and the
Earl of <hi>Glencarn</hi> were read, teſtifying the Earl's Loyalty and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
to the King.</p>

The Treaſon charged upon the Earl in the Indictment conſiſts of
theſe ſix Heads.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That the Earl conſidered the Teſt, and was deſirous to give Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to it as far as he could; <hi>clearly inſinuating thereby he was not
able to give full Obedience.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>That he was confident the Parliament never intended contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Oaths;</hi> thereb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> to inſinuate to the People that the Parliament
did impoſe contradictory Oaths.</item>
                     <item>3. That every Man muſt explain for himſelf, and take it in his own
Senſe; <hi>whereby that excellent Law loſt its Obligations.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. That he took the Teſt ſo far as it was conſiſtent with it ſelf and
the Proteſtant Religion; <hi>which depraved the Teſt, and miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the King's Parliament's Proceedings in the higheſt Degree.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>5. That he did not mean, by taking the Teſt, to bind up himſelf
from wiſhing and endeavouring any Alteration in a lawful Way which
he ſhall think fit, for advancing the Church and State: <hi>where, by
his Example, he invited others to be looſe from the Teſt, to make
Alterations.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>6. <hi>That he underſtood this as part of his Oath;</hi> which was Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Invaſion upon the Royal Legiſlative Power, as if it were
lawful for him to make to himſelf an Act of Parliament.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the better underſtanding the Earl's Caſe, it's fit to conſider,
firſt, the Teſt was not to be impoſed upon any but thoſe who bear
Office; and the Earl was deſirous to have laid down all his Offices,
which was denied him. Secondly, it was not to be impoſed before the
firſt of <hi>January,</hi> whereas all theſe Proceedings againſt the Earl upon
the Teſt, were not only unwarrantable, but the Council uſurped the
Royal Legiſlative Authority by impoſing the Teſt upon the Earl
before. Thirdly, that this Explanation of the Teſt by the Earl,
was by the Duke's Command and Allowance of the Council
one Day, and the next Day made Treaſon for publiſhing it, the
Earl being peremptorily commanded by the Duke to deliver the
Explanation he had drawn in Writing to the Council.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The Earl's Counſel inſiſted, that the Earl having before
always dutifully and loyally behaved himſelf to the King, his
Words and Intentions ought to be interpreted in the beſt Senſe,
and in his Favour.</item>
                     <item>2. That the Act againſt Leaſing-making, and depraving the
King's Laws, were for plain Words and Speeches, tending to make
Diſcords between the King and People, and were never intended
againſt a Perſon in Judicature, required to give the true Senſe of
a Law to the beſt of his Skill and Conſcience; and that it would
be ſtrange in ſuch a Caſe, that this ſhould be a Crime, if one
Man differ from another; whereas oftentimes not only learned
Lawyers, but the Judges themſelves differ about the Interpretation
of Laws.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="583" facs="tcp:60932:297"/>
3. That the Act of Parliament does not impoſe the Teſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
but as a Qualification for thoſe who ſhall bear publick Office;
and therefore it is juſt and commendable in any Perſon who has
a Scruple of Conſcience upon him, to declare his meaning in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of it how he underſtands it; it matters not whether he errs
or not, for <hi>Conſcientia etiam erronea obligat,</hi> eſpecially where a
Man's Conſcience is oppoſite to his Intereſt, as in this Caſe, to loſe
his Preferment; nor was this any Reflection by the Earl upon the
Act of Parliament, nor their Prudence in impoſing the Teſt.</item>
                     <item>4. Tho the Earl could not take the Teſt, otherwiſe than he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
it; yet by the Act, there was no greater Penalty than that
<hi>Habetur pro recuſante,</hi> he ſhould not hold his Places of Truſt.</item>
                     <item>5. That the Counſel allowed the Earl's Explanation, by bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him take his Place, after he had made his Explanation.</item>
                     <item>6. The Earl's Explanation could not be treaſonable, <hi>viz. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
defamandi,</hi> whenas he only made it to the Council when requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
whereas ſome Biſhops, whole Presbyteries and Synods had made
Explanations of the Teſt, and in downright Terms charged it with
Inconſiſtencies and Contradictions, and theſe allowed to be printed,
before the Earl made his; and even the Council themſelves had
made an Explanation of it, before the Earl was tried, tho the
Parliament was then in being, and this made publick. <hi>Q. If this
were not more Treaſon than the Earl's, tho his Counſel durst not ſay ſo.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>7. <hi>That the Earl by making his Explanation, has aſſumed a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power:</hi> to which it was anſwered, The Legiſlative Power
extends to all, but the Earl's Explanation refers only to himſelf,
how he underſtood he might take the Teſt; and this was done
without any Diminution to the Legiſlative Power of making or
interpreting Laws; and if the Legiſlative Power be not ſatisfied,
it cannot extend any further than that the Earl ſhall be a Refuſer of
the Oath, which is neither Treaſon nor Perjury, as was charged
upon the Earl.</item>
                     <item>8. <hi>That the Earl was ready to give Obedience as far as he could,</hi>
did not import the Parliament had impoſed an unlawful Oath: for
here is no Impeachment of the Juſtice or Prudence of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver;
nor can any Law be ſo plain, eſpecially affirmative Laws, as
this is, that every Man ſhall underſtand it alike; and if one Man
declare one Senſe of it, and another otherwiſe, how does this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Treaſon in one or the other, or import the Injuſtice or Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality
of the Law?</item>
                     <item>9. <hi>That the Earl was confident the Parliament never intended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
Oaths;</hi> which was ſo far from being treaſonable, that,
conſidering the plain downright Objections ſpread abroad of the
Inconſiſtencies and Contradictions of the Teſt, it was a high
Vindication of the Parliament.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="584" facs="tcp:60932:298"/>
10. <hi>Therefore he thinks no Body can explain it but for himſelf;</hi>
which having no reference to any other, this cannot be taken for
any diminution of the Parliamentary Authority, or depraving of
the Law.</item>
                     <item>11. <hi>That he takes it ſo far as it is conſiſtent with it ſelf, and the
Proteſtant Religion:</hi> if this be a Crime, the Earl is neither the
Beginner nor Promoter of it; ſo many Biſhops, Synods, and
Presbyteries having before printed it with Allowance from the
Council: nor the Promoter of it; for the Earl ſaid this only for
himſelf, and was paſſive in it, being required by the Council to
make his Explanation, and if they divulged it, 'twas their Fault.</item>
                     <item>12. <hi>That he did not bind up himſelf in his Station, and in a lawful
way, to wiſh and endeavour any Alteration, he thinks to the Advantage
of the Church or State, not repugnant to the Proteſtant Religion and
his Loyalty.</hi> This has reference to the Earl in his Station, as he is
a Peer of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who has not only a Right in Parliament to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
freely of any Law in being, but is a Member which has a
Legiſlative Right and Vote to repeal as well as make Laws; and
herein can no more bind up himſelf, than one Act of Parliament
can bind another Parliament.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Note, the Earl does not ſay this is part of the Teſt-Oath, but
part of his Oath in the Senſe he takes the Teſt, which makes no
alteration of the Teſt.</p>
                  <p>The King's Advocate, Sir <hi>George Mackenzy,</hi> being one of the
Conſpiracy in contriving the Earl's Deſtruction, you need not
fear but he'll ſtrain his Wit to make good his Indictment of the
Earl.</p>
                  <p>He begins with a long Invective againſt the jugling Covenant; and
this excellent Law, the Teſt, was eſtabliſhed to prevent the like for the
future: and that no Law is of private Interpretation, and if it were,
Men would be looſe from Obedience to all Law; and concludes with a
Lie, that there was no force upon the Earl to take the Oath, that he
took it for his own Advantage.</p>
                  <p>It's true, no private Interpretation of any Law is of force to
bind another; and whatſoever Interpretation another makes of
any Law, it makes no Alteration in the Law: but if a Man be
asked his Opinion of any Law, or Point in Law, and he gives
it according to the beſt of his skill, ſhall this be taken for Treaſon
and depraving of the Law, and a Man be in danger of his Life
for it? This was the <hi>Earl's</hi> Caſe, he was called upon by the
Duke to take the Teſt, with his Explanation before he did it; and
whereas <hi>Mackenzy</hi> ſays there was no Force upon the Earl, I'm ſure,
if my Author ſays true, the Earl refuſed to give in the Paper,
whereof he is indicted, and proffered to lay down his Offices up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, till the Duke peremptorily commanded him to do it: if
this were not Force, I would know what is; I'm ſure there
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:60932:298"/>
was no Force, but Corruption and Bribery upon the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
to enter into this villanous Conſpiracy againſt this Noble Earl,
to murder him under the Pretext of Juſtice, which is to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſacred. And let any Man read his whole Harangue, and ſee if
there be any thing in it but forced and ſtrained Inferences; or
any one Proof againſt the Earl, within the Act 60 <hi>Parl. 6. Mary,</hi>
or the 9 <hi>Act. Par. 20. Jac.</hi> 6. which makes it Treaſon to make falſe
Conſtruction of Laws to others, with a Deſign to raiſe Sedition
and Diſſenſion among the King's Subjects; ſo that ſome Overt Act
or Speech to others with a Deſign to raiſe Sedition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be
proved; and not what is ſaid in the Council, or any Court of
Judicature.</p>
                  <p>However, as was the Advocate, ſuch were the Aſſizers, whereof
the Marqueſs of <hi>Montroſs</hi> (the Earl's Father's moſt bitter Enemy)
was the Fore-Man, and the reſt of the Pack of the ſame Stamp;
who, with one Voice, found the Earl guilty of <hi>Treaſon, Leaſing-making,
and Leaſing-telling;</hi> but like conſcientious Men, having
made the Earl to have forfeited his Life, Honour and Eſtate, by
a Majority they find the Earl innocent of Perjury, which they
could get nothing by.</p>
                  <p>So that the Noble Lord <hi>Lorn</hi> is become the <hi>Forlorn</hi> late Earl of
<hi>Argyle;</hi> yet the Earl, not to be wanting to himſelf in this deplorable
State, next day but one, <hi>viz. December</hi> the <hi>15th,</hi> by a Friend humbly
intreated to ſpeak with the Duke: who returned Anſwer, <hi>It was
not ordinary to ſpeak with Criminals, except with Rogues on ſome Plot,
where Diſcoveries might be expected.</hi> By this you may ſee what Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
governed this Prince, and what might be expected from him,
if he became King.</p>
                  <p>The next Day after the Earl's Sentence, <hi>viz. December</hi> the <hi>14th,</hi>
the Council gave the King notice of it, and expected his further
Pleaſure, now the Work is done to his Hand: but it ſeems his
Highneſs was very impatient till he had the Earl's Blood; for he
ſaid, <hi>If the Expreſs from the King came not timouſly, he would take
upon himſelf what was to be done;</hi> by which you may ſee what an
Aſcendency the Duke had over the King: However, the Earl upon
the ſixteenth, petitioned the Duke, that he might ſend a Petition
to the King, which was refuſed.</p>
                  <p>Things brought to this Extremity, and the Earl hearing that
ſome Troops, and a Regiment of Foot were to be brought down
from the Caſtle to the Common Goal, from which Criminals were
uſually brought to Execution, he reſolved to try to make his Eſcape;
and the rather, becauſe about ſeven at Night, he had notice that
new Orders were given for further ſecuring him, and that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
Guards were to be doubled, and that none were ſuffered to go
out without ſhewing their Faces, and therefore a Friend adviſed
him not to attempt it; <hi>No,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Earl, now is the Time,</hi> and ſo
he attempted it, and it pleaſed God he eſcaped.</p>

                     <hi>Hereupon the Lords of Aſſize, upon the twenty third of</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,
<hi>pronounced the</hi> Earl <hi>guilty of the</hi> Crimes of Treaſon, Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing-making
and Leaſing-telling, <hi>for which, being detained in the
Caſtle of</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>out of which, ſince the Verdict, having made
his Eſcape, therefore they adjudged the ſaid Earl to be executed
to Death, and his</hi> Name, Memory and Honours to be extinct; and his
Arms to be riven forth, and delete out of the Book of Arms, ſwa that

                  </p>
                  <p>But tho the Earl be eſcaped out of Priſon, whereto ſhall he flee?
For <hi>Terras (I'am ſure</hi> Britannicas) <hi>Aſtraea reliquit;</hi> he had ſome
thoughts of caſting himſelf at the King's Feet, but thoſe ſoon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,

                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Hawles</hi> in his Remarks upon <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Trial, <hi>F.</hi> 18. out
of <hi>Tully</hi>'s Offices, lays this down for a Rule, <hi>That nothing is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
but what is honeſt;</hi> for which <hi>Tully</hi> gives many Reaſons, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo convincing as the Examples he brings in publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
matters; and tho the Empire was vaſt, and he bore a great Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
in it, and was very knowing in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman Hiſtories,</hi>
yet was he not able to bring a hundredth Part of Examples to
prove his Poſition, as had been in this little Iſland in the ſpace of
eight Years: And in his Preface, gives ſix Reaſons for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection
to the late Government, <hi>viz. Exorbitant Fines, cruel and
illegal Proſecutions, outragious Damages, diſpenſing with the Teſt and
penal Laws, and undue Proſecutions in criminal, but more eſpecially
in capital Matters.</hi> But theſe I take to be the Effects of thoſe
Councils which governed in <hi>England</hi> ever after the King's Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
tho they did not ſo manifeſtly appear till the Duke was ſent
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and after the Diſſolution of the Parliament at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi>
and for theſe firſt ſix Years after the Diſſolution of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the <hi>Tories</hi> in <hi>England</hi> as well as in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
were the Tools which the Popiſh Faction made uſe of for carrying
on their Deſigns, then they were laid by, and the <hi>Whigs</hi> ſet up, as
they thought, to finiſh the Work.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tories</hi> were ſo far from being ſuppreſſed by the Proceedings
of the Commons againſt them laſt <hi>Weſtminſter Parliament,</hi> that they
only ſo much more irritated them againſt the <hi>Whigs</hi> after the Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of the laſt <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and <hi>Oxford Parliaments,</hi> and this was
what the Popiſh Party deſired.</p>
                  <p>The King's Declaration, ſigned <hi>Francis Gwyn,</hi> was not only obeyed
by the <hi>Tories,</hi> but entertained with unexpreſſible Joy, and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with manifold Returns of Thanks to his Majeſty; and now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>Halcyon Days</hi> were expected, and an abſolute Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:60932:299"/>
the <hi>Whigs:</hi> and the King, to gratify the <hi>Tories</hi> in their Jollity,
and after the Bill for repealing the Act of 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> was taken out
of the Houſe of Lords before it was paſſed, which little ſorted
with the King's Declarations of Indulgence, has this Law now
put in Force againſt the Diſſenters, and proſecuted with that Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
that many thouſands of Families were undone by it, yet little
of the Money levied upon them was brought into the <hi>Exchequer,</hi>
and you may be ſure the Proſecutors would take their own ſhare,
and it was no difficult Matter to get a Grant, or at leaſt a Pardon
for the King's. Among the reſt of the Worthies in this pious Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
one <hi>Jenner</hi> a Lawyer was one, who for this and other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
Acts, was after knighted and made one of the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Barons of the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> and Sir <hi>Dudly North,</hi> the Keeper's own
Brother, was another: and though theſe Men were excepted out of
the Act of Indemnity made by this King, and Informations againſt
them in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and among the reſt, againſt this <hi>Jenner,</hi>
yet upon pleading their Pardons, I do find no great matttr came of
them. And now ſince the Meal-Tub Plot, and that of <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>

and the antient Government of that Kingdom, to which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the Concurrence of this Houſe, to which the Commons agreed.</p>
                  <p>The Evidence by which the Lords diſcovered this Plot, were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> and of the Popiſh Religion, and it's probable, were
Partakers of the Deſign of this Maſſacre, and had not their Pardons;
or if they had, they were poor, and had no means to ſubſiſt, now
the <hi>Oxford Parliament</hi> was diſſolved and no Proſpect of another,
eſpecially having now loſt their Friends and Dependance for having
given their Evidence of the Diſcovery of the Plot, and were in a
ſtrange Country. In this ſtate the Court imployed a ſort of Men,
partly by Terror, and partly by their Neceſſities, to work upon the
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> to pervert their Evidence another way.</p>
                  <p>And the Cauſe being the ſame, it had the ſame Effect upon
others as well as the <hi>Iriſh:</hi> for the <hi>Oxford Parliament</hi> being diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and all Hopes of Enquiry further into the Popiſh Plot, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:60932:300"/>
deſperate; <hi>Dugdale, Turbervile</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> not having (that I
can find) gotten their Pardons, and having loſt their Dependances
upon their having given their Evidence, and being reduced to the
ſame Neceſſities the <hi>Iriſh Witneſſes</hi> were, were eaſily wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſmother the Popiſh Plot, and to ſwear another upon the
principal Inquirers into the Popiſh; nay, even my Lord <hi>H</hi>—(tho
not in the like Circumſtances) could not procure his Pardon
till his Drudgery of Swearing was over.</p>
                  <p>The Foundation thus laid, now we proceed to ſhew how the
King made good his Declaration for calling frequent Parliaments,
and in uſing his utmoſt Endeavours of extirpating Papacy; and it
is without any Precedent, that ever any King before did truckle
to ſuch vile and mean things, to invert his Declaration, and his
manifold repeated Promiſes to the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> the Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> was diſſolved, and
upon the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> following, an Indictment of High Treaſon
was preferred againſt <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris</hi> to the Grand Jury at
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> for the Hundred of <hi>Oſwalst;</hi> but the Grand Jury having
the Vote of the Commons of the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> ſo freſh in their
Memories, deſired the Opinion of the Court, whether they might
ſafely proceed upon it: and you need not doubt but the Court gave
their Opinion they might. So the Grand Jury found the Bill.</p>
                  <p>From the time that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was removed from <hi>Newgate</hi> to
the <hi>Tower,</hi> which was 10 Weeks before this Indictment, he was
kept ſo cloſe Priſoner, that his Wife, nor any others, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to come at him; whereas the Lords impeached in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had the Liberty of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and for any Man to viſit them.</p>
                  <p>Yet <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Wife, foreſeeing the Deſign of the Trial of
her Husband, had gone to Counſel, and had a Plea drawn to the
Juriſdiction of the Court; to which the Attorney-General demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Counſel joined in the Demurrer.</p>
                  <p>It were Vanity and extream Arrogance in me, to judg of the
nice Pleadings on both ſides, concerning the Form and Subſtance;
or to give a Reaſon why the Court over-ruled <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Plea,
ſince
the Court did not.</p>
                  <p>Yet, I ſay, the Reports of <hi>Coke, Dier, Plowden,</hi> and others,
would have proved dry Buſineſſes, if the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi>
had given ſuch Judgments as the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Bench</hi> did in <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s
Caſe.</p>
                  <p>And I ſay alſo, That no Man lives out of Society and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;
and that in every Country there are Laws for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mens Lives, and to protect them in Society and Commerce;
and that in every Country there is a Power which is looſe from
theſe Laws, and gives Laws to all the Subjects of thoſe Countries.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe all Laws are vain unleſs they be executed, every
Country has Judicatories wherein theſe Laws are executed, which
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:60932:300"/>
differ in different Countries. The ſupreme Power of this Nation
reſides in a Parliament, whereof the King is the Head; and the
Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Repreſentatives of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
are the Body.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Courts of Judicature have their diſtinct Juriſdictions, and
are reſtrained to certain Rules and Methods: the higheſt of theſe
Courts are the Body of the Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lords Spiritual
and Temporal, and the Commons, which have diſtinct Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but are not bound up in their Judicatories by ſuch ſtrict Rules
as other Courts are.</p>
                  <p>Other Courts take Cognizance of civil and criminal Caſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
particular Men; but theſe Courts of Parliament take Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of the State and Grievances of the Nation, where only they
find Relief: and tho no other Courts take Cognizance of Matters
tranſacted in Parliament, yet either of theſe Courts take Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of all Proceedings in other Courts, and not only reverſe all
illegal Proceedings in them, but puniſh the Judges of all other
Courts for any Errors or Abuſes committed by them: ſo if any
Perſon or Perſon ſhall grow ſo great as to be dangerous to the
Publick, tho they be out of the Reach of other Courts, yet they
are ſubject to theſe Courts of Parliament; and by theſe Courts the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation have preſerved their Liberties and Laws, now
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> have loſt them, which before had their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
of the States (all one with our Parliaments) and in loſing
them have loſt their Liberty and Laws, to the Arbitrary Will of
their Princes.</p>
                  <p>The Juriſdiction of Parliaments hath been in all Ages in <hi>England</hi>
eſteemed ſacred, ſo that other Courts rarely preſumed to take
Cognizance of Caſes which were in the Juriſdiction of, or depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Parliament; for this was to depoſe the Parliament, and
uſurp their Juriſdiction: nor do we read that ever any other
Court aſſumed this Authority, but in the Reigns of Kings affecting
Tyranny and Arbitrary Power.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Judges which (I think) gave their Opinion, That the
Courts in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> might take Cognizance of Cauſes deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
in Parliament, were <hi>Treſilian</hi> and <hi>Belknap,</hi> in 11 <hi>Rich.</hi> II.
for which they were impeached by the Commons in Parliament, of
no leſs than High Treaſon; and for which, by Judgment of the
Lords in Parliament, <hi>Treſilian</hi> was hanged, and <hi>Belknap</hi> baniſhed.
Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> in his Pleadings for <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> cites another Caſe
in 20 <hi>Rich.</hi> II. of a Perſon who exhibited a Petition in Parliament,
which ſuggeſted ſomething which amounted to High Treaſon
(which it may be was determinable by Common Law.) This Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was after indicted at Common Law, found guilty, and pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but becauſe the Buſineſs was depending in Parliament, the
Proſecution and Judgment were made void in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="590" facs="tcp:60932:301"/>
The next Caſe, I think, (but of an higher Nature, for <hi>Treſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
and <hi>Belknap</hi> only gave their Opinion) was that of Sir <hi>John
Elliot,</hi> my Lord <hi>Hollis,</hi> &amp;c. 5 <hi>Car.</hi> I. when an Information was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
againſt them in the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Bench,</hi> they pleaded to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
of the Court, being for Matters tranſacted in Parliament:
the Court over-ruled their Plea, and gave Judgment againſt them,
and Reaſons (ſuch as they were) for their Judgment: but in
the 19 <hi>Car.</hi> I. upon a ſolemn Debate in the Commons Houſe, and
upon their Reaſons given at a Conference with the Lords, the
Judgment of the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Bench,</hi> Reaſons and all, were reverſed by
a Writ of Error in the Lords Houſe; and after, the Judges who
gave the Judgment were impeach'd of High-Treaſon by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
for endeavouring to ſubvert the fundamental Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>This Caſe of <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> I take to be the fourth of this kind,
yet ſhall open a Gap for a fifth: but that this Caſe may be better
underſtood, it will be neceſſary to diſtinguiſh between an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Information, and an Indictment by the Commons in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                  <p>An Indictment or Information is at the Suit of the King, and
the Judges and Jury are tied up to ſome ſingle Iſſue; as in this
Caſe of <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> the Trial was, whether he was guilty or not
of the Treaſon whereof he was indicted.</p>
                  <p>But an Impeachment of the Commons is at their Suit, and of all
the Commons of <hi>England;</hi> nor are they tied up to one ſingle Iſſue,
but impeach for Treaſon, and other Crimes and Miſdemeanours in
the ſame Impeachment; they aſſume to themſelves, That all the
Commons in <hi>England</hi> have a Right in the King, and all the Laws
and Conſtitutions of the Nation, and therefore can impeach where
none of the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> can take any Cognizance at
the Suit of the King, either by Indictment or Information.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> he was examined
by the Earls of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> and She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff
<hi>Corniſh,</hi> who found in him a Diſpoſition to diſcover the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Popiſh Plot, and alſo to make a further Diſcovery of
the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey;</hi> but the next Day <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>
was carried to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and kept cloſe Priſoner, and out
of their Power, to whom <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> promiſed to make a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
                  <p>The Commons conceiving themſelves and all the Commons of
<hi>England</hi> concerned in this Plot (wherein the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador,
his Confeſſor, my Lord <hi>H</hi>—, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and
her Woman <hi>Wall,</hi> and even the King himſelf, for <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> had
ſeveral times acquainted the King with it, and the King gave him
Money, and countenanced it, were Agents) impeached <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi>
thereby to enquire into the Bottom of this Buſineſs,
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:60932:301"/>
which no Court in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> could do; and this I take to
be the Reaſon of the Commons Vote of the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>March 1681,
That if any inferiour Courts ſhall proceed upon</hi> Fitz-Harris, <hi>and he be
found Guilty, the Houſe will declare them guilty of Murder, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers
of the Rights of the Commons of</hi> England: And ſo it fell out,
that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> being indicted upon the ſingle Iſſue of contriving
and publiſhing the Libel, was convicted and executed upon it,
tho he deſired to proceed upon the Diſcovery of this Plot to the
Earls of <hi>Eſſex, Shaftsbury,</hi> and to Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> and to make
an End of his Evidence againſt my Lord <hi>H</hi>—, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.
So that whether <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was murder'd in his Perſon or
not, it's no Queſtion but his Evidence for further Diſcovery of
this and the Popiſh Plot was murder'd by this Trial.</p>
                  <p>I will make theſe Remarks more upon this Trial, that in the
Caſe of <hi>Treſilian</hi> and <hi>Belknap,</hi> the Nation was in no other Danger
than the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi>'s invading the Juriſdiction of
Parliament; and the Caſe of my Lord <hi>Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>John Elliot,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Selden, &amp;c.</hi> was only for Miſdemeanour; whereas the King's
Perſon, and the Safety of the Nation, were concerned in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
which <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> might have made, (ſee Mr. <hi>Hawles</hi>'s
fine Remarks upon the Practices and Illegalities of the Judgment
of the Court not warranted by the Common or any Statute Law)
and that the Conſequences of this Trial were manifoldly more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
to the Nation than if <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Deſign had taken
Effect.</p>
                  <p>The Fright of <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Diſcovery of this new Popiſh Plot
being ſeemingly allayed by his Death, Revenge, with winged
Haſte purſues the Diſcoverers of the old. It was in <hi>Trinity-Term</hi>
that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was tried and executed; and after this Term, an
Indictment of High Treaſon was exhibited to the Grand Jury of
<hi>London</hi> againſt <hi>Stephen Colledge,</hi> a mean Fellow, but a great Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
againſt the Popiſh Plot, who was more known by the Name
of <hi>Proteſtant Joiner</hi> than <hi>Stephen Colledge.</hi> The Fore-man was one
<hi>Wilmer:</hi> This Indictment would not down, but the Grand Jury
returned an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> upon it, for which <hi>Wilmer</hi> was forced to
fly his Country.</p>
                  <p>The Deſign not ſucceeding in <hi>London,</hi> the Scene againſt <hi>Colledge</hi>
is laid at <hi>Oxford;</hi> the Judges were Chief Juſtice <hi>North,</hi> Juſtice
<hi>Jones,</hi> Juſtice <hi>Raimond,</hi> and Juſtice <hi>Levins:</hi> To make ſure of a
Bill to be found there againſt <hi>Colledge,</hi> the King's Counſel had
prepared Witneſſes at the Aſſizes to poſt thither; and there, to
make ſure Work, the King's Counſel are privately ſhut up with
the Jury till they had found the Bill, which Mr. <hi>Hawles</hi> ſays was
a moſt unjuſtifiable and unſufferable Practice.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe things were contriving, <hi>Colledge</hi> had the Honour,
as well as <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> to be committed and continued a cloſe
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:60932:302"/>
Priſoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi> yet the Lords impeached in Parliament had
the Liberty of it, and free Acceſs was permitted to them: it's true
indeed, <hi>Colledge</hi> was permitted to have a Solicitor and Counſel,
which was Mr. <hi>West,</hi> I think a Plotter or Setter in the <hi>Rye</hi>-Plot,
as dark as <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s, and as like it as two Apples are one to
the other.</p>
                  <p>But this was not out of Favour to <hi>Colledge,</hi> but to betray him;
for when the Bill againſt <hi>Colledge</hi> was found at <hi>Oxford, Murrel</hi> a
Goaler, and <hi>Seywel</hi> a Meſſenger were ſent to bring <hi>Colledge</hi> to Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;
who, after they had taken him out of Priſon, run him into
a Houſe, and by Order of the King's Counſel, took from him all
his Inſtructions for his Defence, and carry'd them to the King's
Counſel, as well to diſable him to make his Defence, as to enable
the King's Counſel how to proceed againſt him by ſome way he
was not provided to make his Defence.</p>
                  <p>Upon <hi>Colledge</hi>'s Arraignment, he demanded his Papers taken
from him by <hi>Murrel</hi> and <hi>Seywel,</hi> which were denied by the Court
till he had pleaded guilty or not to his Indictment. Here take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that Sir <hi>Francis Pemberton,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Jones,</hi> and Juſtice
<hi>Raimond,</hi> having done the Court's Job in <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Trial, a
new Set of four is made to do this of <hi>Colledge</hi>'s; the chief of theſe
was Sir <hi>Francis North</hi> (a Man cut out to all Intents and Purpoſes
for ſuch a Work, and as if born to do it, his Father was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee-Man
in all the late Times againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and his
Grandfather one of the ſeven who condemned Arch-biſhop <hi>Laud)</hi>
it's no matter who were the other three, for <hi>North</hi> was the Mouth
of the Court.</p>
                  <p>This was the firſt time that ever any Priſoner had his Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
taken from him to make his Defence, and at a time when there
were ſuch Contrivances to take away his Life. My Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
told <hi>Colledge,</hi> he took not away his Papers; but <hi>Colledge</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
they were taken from him upon pretence of bringing them
to his Lordſhip.</p>
                  <p>The Court and Counſel had a twofold Deſign upon <hi>Colledge</hi> in
ſeizing his Papers; one, to trapan <hi>Colledge</hi> to plead guilty or not
before they deliver'd the Papers; which having done, it was too
late to plead either to the Juriſdiction of the Court, or that the
Indictment was erroneous, as it was, it being of different Natures,
as, for Treaſon and Miſdemeanours.</p>
                  <p>Here I leave it to the Learned to judg whether the Court and
King's Counſel did not in this Indictment endeavour to depoſe the
Parliamentary Authority, and uſurp it themſelves; for tho the
Commons may impeach generally for Treaſon and Miſdemeanours
in the ſame Impeachment, yet neither by the Common, or any
Statute Law, any ſuch Indictment can be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="593" facs="tcp:60932:302"/>
The other Deſign was to diſable <hi>Colledge</hi> to make his Defence
after his pleading not guilty: <hi>Colledge</hi> finding himſelf thus beſet
tho a mean Man, yet with a <hi>Roman</hi> Courage ſaid, <hi>This was a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Conſpiracy, not only againſt his Life, but againſt all the Proteſtants
of</hi> England: And herein he proved a true Prophet.</p>
                  <p>The Courage of the Man put the Court and King's Counſel to
the Whiſper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was never before done in any Court of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law; and now the Court muſt be adjourned, the Pretence
being for Dinner, tho they had breakfaſted but a little before: and
before their Return, the King's Counſel altered their Method of
proceeding againſt the Priſoner from that they before deſigned;
and ſo ſorted their Evidence that they might not contradict one
another, and ſo would not examine ſome of his Evidence.</p>
                  <p>Yet upon the Return of the Court, the Attorney, Sir <hi>R. S.</hi> for
fear his Inſtructions might not well be remembred or underſtood,
moved, the King's Evidence might be examined in the hearing of
one another; which tho over-ruled, yet 'twas not obſerved: and
to ſatisfy the Jury, the Court (Sir <hi>F. N.)</hi> told them in ſumming
up the Evidence, they would inform the Jury what part of it was
Treaſon, and what Miſdemeanor, which they did not. Mr. <hi>Hawles</hi>'s
learned Remarks herein, as well upon Law and Practice, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the Conſideration of the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The Court and Counſel thus armed <hi>Cap-a-Pe,</hi> and the Priſoner
bound Hand and Foot, you need not doubt of a glorious Victory
over him: And now let's ſee by what valiant Combatants they

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>chiev'd it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Champion againſt <hi>Colledge,</hi> but whether to prove Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or Miſdemeanour is not yet determined, was <hi>Stephen Dugdale,</hi>
That in a Barber's Shop and a Coffee-houſe he had ſpoken vilifying
Words of the King; that <hi>Colledge</hi> had ſhew'd him ſeveral ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Libels and Pictures, of which he was the Author; that <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
had a ſilk Armour, a Brace of Horſe-Piſtols, a Pocket-Piſtol,
and a Sword; that he had ſeveral ſtout Men would ſtand by him,
that he would make uſe of them in Defence of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and that the King's Party were but a handful to his.</p>
                  <p>To paſs over the Improbability of <hi>Colledge</hi>'s deſigning Treaſon
againſt the King, and truſt the Management of it to Papiſts, and
none of them ever diſcovered the thing they ſwore, till after the
Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> tho moſt, if not all, were pretended to be
tranſacted or done before; let's ſee what Credit could be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
given to any of the Evidence againſt him.</p>
                  <p>1. Dugdale'<hi>s Evidence was confronted by Dr.</hi> Oates, <hi>who teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that</hi> Dugdale <hi>ſaid,</hi> He knew nothing against any Proteſtant in
England; <hi>and being taxed by</hi> Oates, <hi>that he had gone againſt his
Conſcience in the Evidence he gave to the Grand Jury at</hi> London
<hi>againſt</hi> Colledge, Dugdale <hi>ſaid,</hi> It was long of Colonel <hi>Warcup
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:60932:303"/>
(a worthy Perſon, who, for this and ſuch like Services, is ſince
Knighted)</hi> for he could get no Money elſe. Elizabeth Hunt <hi>teſtified,
That after</hi> Colledge <hi>was in Priſon,</hi> Dugdale <hi>told her,</hi> He did not
believe <hi>Colldge</hi> had any more hand in conſpiring against the King,
than the Child unborn; and that he had as live have given an 100 <hi>l.</hi>
he had never ſpoken what he had; and that he had nothing to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Colledge</hi> which would touch his Life: <hi>and</hi> Yates <hi>teſtified,</hi> that
when he ſaid <hi>Colledge</hi> was an honest Man, and ſtood up for the King
and Government; Dugdale <hi>anſwer'd,</hi> I believe he does, and I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Haynes <hi>ſwore</hi> Colledge <hi>ſaid,</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs the King would let the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſit at <hi>Oxford,</hi> they would ſeize him, and bring him to the Block;
<hi>and that he ſaid,</hi> The City had fifteen hundred Barrels of Powder, and
ten thouſand Men ready at an hour's warning.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>To confront this Evidence,</hi> Hickman <hi>teſtified that</hi> Haynes
<hi>ſwore,</hi> God damn him he cared not what he ſwore; for it was his
Trade to get Money by Swearing. <hi>Mrs.</hi> Hall <hi>ſaid ſhe heard</hi> Haynes
<hi>own,</hi> That he was employed to put a Plot upon the Diſſenting Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.
<hi>And Mrs.</hi> Richards <hi>ſaid,</hi> She heard him ſay the ſame thing.
Whaley <hi>ſaid,</hi> Haynes ſtole a Silver Tankard from him: <hi>And</hi> Lun <hi>ſaid,</hi>
Haynes <hi>ſaid,</hi> The Parliament were a Company of Rogues for not giving
the King Money; but he would help the King to Money enough out of
the Fanaticks Eſtates. Everard <hi>teſtified that</hi> Haynes <hi>ſaid,</hi> His Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
and hard Pay drove him to ſay any thing against the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.
Turbervile <hi>ſwore,</hi> Colledge <hi>ſaid at</hi> Oxford, That he wiſhed the
King would begin; if he did not, they would begin with him, and ſeize
him; and that he <hi>(Colledge)</hi> came to <hi>Oxford</hi> for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>3. Oates <hi>ſaid,</hi> Turbervile <hi>ſaid, a little before the Witneſſes were
ſworn at the</hi> Old-Baily, That he was not a Witneſs againſt <hi>Colledge,</hi>
nor could give any Evidence against him; and that after he came to
<hi>Oxford,</hi> he had been ſworn before the Grand Jury against <hi>Colledge;</hi>
and that the Proteſtant Citizens had deſerted him, and God damn him
he would not ſtarve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Smith</hi> ſwore, <hi>Colledge</hi>'s ſpeaking ſcandalous Words againſt
the King, and of his having Armour, which he ſhewed <hi>Smith,</hi>
and ſaid, <hi>Theſe are the things that will deſtroy the pitiful Guards of
Rowley;</hi> and that he expected the King would ſeize ſome of the
Members of Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which if done, he would be one
ſhould ſeize the King: that <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> had made his Noſe bleed,
but before long he hoped to ſee a great deal more Blood ſhed for
the Cauſe: that if any, nay <hi>Rowley</hi> himſelf, came to diſarm the
City, he would be the Death of him.</p>
                  <p>4. To confront this Evidence, <hi>Blake</hi> teſtified that <hi>Smith</hi> ſaid,
<hi>Haynes</hi>'s Diſcovery was a Sham-Plot, a Meal-Tub-Plot. <hi>Bolron</hi> ſaid,
<hi>Smith</hi> would have had him ſwore againſt Sir <hi>John Brooke,</hi> my
Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and <hi>Colledge,</hi> things of which he knew nothing,
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:60932:303"/>
and told him what he <hi>(Bolron)</hi> ſhould ſwear, leſt they ſhould
diſagree in their Evidence. <hi>Oates</hi> teſtified, <hi>Smith</hi> ſaid, <hi>God damn
him, he would have</hi> Colledge'<hi>s Blood:</hi> and <hi>Mowbray</hi> teſtified that
<hi>Smith</hi> tempted him to be a Witneſs againſt <hi>Colledge</hi> and Sir <hi>John
Brooke,</hi> and ſaid, if the Parliament did not give the King Money,
and ſtood on the Bill of Excluſion, that was Pretence enough to
ſwear a Deſign to ſecure the King at <hi>Oxford:</hi> And <hi>Everard</hi> and
others teſtified, <hi>Smith</hi> ſaid he knew of no Presbyterian or Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Plot; and ſaid, Juſtice <hi>Warcup</hi> would have perſwaded him
to ſwear againſt ſome Lords a Presbyterian Plot, but he knew of
none.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the material Evidences thus confronted, which
ſhould prove <hi>Colledge</hi>'s Treaſon and Miſdemeanour for taking away
his Life: But this Evidence was ſo baffled, that for Shame the
King's Counſel never play'd them after againſt any other but my
Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> but were forced to ſet up for new againſt my
Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>Objection.</hi> In criminal Caſes, eſpecially of Treaſon, if Evidence
did not ariſe from the Conſpirators, who are ſuppoſed to be ill Men,
ſcarce any other means can be found for preventing or puniſhing theſe;
and that <hi>Dangerfield</hi> was of an ill Fame, and <hi>Dugdale, Smith,</hi> and
<hi>Turbervile,</hi> were Witneſſes in Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, and ſo
their Evidence is to be credited as well in this as in the Popiſh Plot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Nor would the Popiſh Plot have been believed, if it
had no Foundation but the Credit of the Witneſſes; but <hi>Coleman</hi>'s
Letters, Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi>'s Murder, and <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Letters
of it that Night to <hi>Evers</hi> my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Confeſſor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> gave
more than ſufficient Evidence of the Popiſh Plot: beſide, the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the Popiſh Plot did ariſe from the Evidence of their
own Accord, not hired and ſought to give it, as in this. And
can any Man believe that <hi>Colledge,</hi> ſo zealous a Proteſtant, ſhould
deſign the Deſtruction of the King, and contrive it by Papiſts, to
whom he was ſo averſe? And it were Madneſs to think <hi>Colledge</hi>
could do this alone; for none of all the Evidence ſwear any other
to be concerned with him in it.</p>
                  <p>There were other Evidence againſt <hi>Colledge, viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sir <hi>William Jennings,</hi> about Words which <hi>Colledge</hi> ſhould ſpeak;
and <hi>Atterbury, Seywel,</hi> and <hi>Stevens,</hi> concerning finding Pictures in
<hi>Colledge</hi>'s Poſſeſſion when they ſeized him: but, as Mr. <hi>Hawles</hi>
obſerves, theſe, by no Law in <hi>England,</hi> could be made Treaſon,
admitting all they ſaid to be true: But tho at <hi>Colledge</hi> this Scene
began, and he was executed as a Traitor, it did not end in him,
as he propheſied.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="596" facs="tcp:60932:304"/>
For <hi>Colledge</hi>'s Blood was too mean a Sacrifice to appeaſe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
Ghoſts of the martyred <hi>Roman</hi> Saints, and was but an Inlet
to ſpill nobler Blood; therefore upon the <hi>31st</hi> of <hi>August</hi> he was
executed, and upon the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> following, 1681. the
Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had a Bill of High Treaſon at the Seſſions of the
<hi>Old-Baily, London,</hi> preferred againſt him.</p>
                  <p>I will not here curtail any of the Remarks which Mr. <hi>Hawles</hi> has
made upon this Bill, or the Trial of my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi>'s,
Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi>'s and <hi>Wilmer</hi>'s Trials, but leave them entire to the
Reader; it's enough for me to ſhew how well the King, by theſe Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
made good his Declaration of preſerving the Proteſtant Religion,
and his utmost Endeavour to extirpate Popery: yet I ſhall make ſome
Remarks upon my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Caſe which Mr. <hi>Hawles</hi> either
has not, or not ſo fully.</p>
                  <p>Upon the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1679, the King, after he had ſent the
Duke into <hi>Holland,</hi> diſſolved his old Privy Council, and choſe a
new one, whereof the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was Preſident; and in
Parliament declared the ill Effects he had found of ſingle Councils
and Cabals, and therefore had made Choice of this Council, which
next to the Advice of his great Council of Parliament (which he
would often conſult in all his weighty and important Affairs) he
would be adviſed by this Privy Council: and to take away all
Jealouſy that he was influenced by Popiſh Councils, he had ſent his
Brother beyond Sea.</p>
                  <p>But now, <hi>quanto mutatus!</hi> No more Parliaments ſo long as this
King lives. The Council, whoſe Advice, next the Parliament, he
would take, is now diſſolved, and the Preſident's Life is ſought
for; the Duke of late ſent away, that he might not influence the
King's Councils, is now returned, and governs all, and made High
Commiſſioner of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where, at this time, he is contriving
the Deſtruction of the noble Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> whilſt his Brother is
doing that of my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and both act their Parts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Vail of ſacred Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>But how to bring the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> upon the Stage, was
Matter of great Inquiry; other Evidence beſides <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and thoſe
<hi>Colledge</hi> had ſo baffled, could ſcarce be found; and this Evidence,
'twas feared, would no more prevail upon a <hi>London</hi> Grand Jury,
than before it did when the Bill was preferred againſt <hi>Colledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Captain <hi>Henry Wilkinſon</hi> was a <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Gentleman, who having
ſerved King <hi>Charles</hi> I. in his Wars, and been very inſtrumental
in the Reſtoration of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. being fall'n into Decay (a
Fate uſually attending the Cavaliers who ſerved either of thoſe
Kings) was for his Sufferings, Integrity, and Honeſty, preferred
by the Earls of <hi>Craven</hi> and <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> to be Governour of <hi>Caroli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
and one of his Sons to be Surveyor-General of it, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Regiſter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="597" facs="tcp:60932:304"/>
Captain <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> made uſe of the little Stock he had left, and
ſuch Credit as he could procure, to fit himſelf upon this Account,
and hired a Ship called the <hi>Abigail,</hi> of a hundred and thirty Tuns,
and victualled her for the Maſter and ten Men, and ſuch other
Paſſengers as he ſhould take in.</p>
                  <p>In this Number, one Mr. <hi>John Booth</hi> deſired that he and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
might accompany the Captain to <hi>Carolina,</hi> which was agreed
to; but the Captain being under ſeveral Diſappointments, and the
charges of the Ship of four Months lying in the River, inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the Captain was arreſted and thrown into the <hi>Compter;</hi> from
whence he removed himſelf to the <hi>King's Bench.</hi> The Captain's
Neceſſities were equal, or more than thoſe of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Evidence,
but the Captain (at leaſt as he ſuppoſed) had no need of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for any thing deſigned againſt the King or Government, as the
<hi>Iriſh Evidence</hi> had; ſo the firſt Attempt upon the Captain was
to hire him to give Evidence againſt my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudly</hi> were ſo zealous to fill <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th</hi>'s Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
by ſtraining the Penal Laws to utmoſt Rigour, as the Vogue
went, <hi>Graham, Baynes</hi> and <hi>Burton,</hi> were as zealous to pack Juries,
and procure Evidence for carrying on this black Deſign; but I do
not find <hi>Burton</hi> was in this upon Captain <hi>Wilkinſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the eighth of <hi>October, Baynes</hi> made his firſt Attack upon
the Captain, and told him, that he had been lately with Mr. <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
who had a great Intereſt with my Lord <hi>H.</hi> and that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
could not but know much of my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Deſigns,
and that he had now a deſired Opportunity to diſcover them; and
urged the Captain not to deny the proffer, and that he need not fear
his getting a Pardon: but the Captain was conſtant that he knew
nothing of any ſuch Deſign. By this time <hi>Booth</hi> was a Priſoner
in the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> as well as the Captain; and upon the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
<hi>Booth</hi> attack'd the Captain, and told him he might have
500 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> or 10000 <hi>l.</hi> if he would diſcover what he knew
of my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Deſign againſt the King, and that the
Captain ſhould appear at Court, and have Aſſurance of it from
Perſons of Honour; but this wrought not upon the Captain nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Upon the thirteenth <hi>Baynes, Booth</hi> and <hi>Graham</hi> renewed the
Promiſes <hi>Baynes</hi> and <hi>Booth</hi> had made, and that he ſhould have the
King's Promiſe for the ſame, and his Royal Word for a Reward
for his Sufferings; and that <hi>Graham</hi> was ſent by ſome of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to bring the Captain to the King, and that he had an Order for
it: but all would not do; for the Captain was reſolved not to go
to <hi>White-Hall</hi> if he could help it. Upon the fourteenth <hi>Booth</hi> told
the Captain, that Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> my <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Secretary (who was
a Priſoner in the <hi>Gate-houſe)</hi> had ſent to the Council, that he
would come and diſcover all he knew; and therefore he urged the
Captain to have the Honour of being the firſt Diſcoverer, and that

to the former Promiſes the Captain ſhould have 500 <hi>l. per Annum</hi>
ſettled on him in <hi>Ireland</hi> by the D. of <hi>York:</hi> but all to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Upon the fifteenth, <hi>Booth</hi> and <hi>Baynes</hi> attackt the Captain again:
the Captain asked <hi>Baynes</hi> why he was ſo urgent for his Teſtimony;
<hi>Baynes</hi> anſwered, That as yet they had none but <hi>Iriſh Evidence,</hi>
which would not be believed, but if the Captain came to it, he
was not blemiſhed in his Credit; and then <hi>Baynes</hi> told him, if he
would not go, he <hi>(Baynes)</hi> had a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> from my Lord
Chief Juſtice <hi>Pemberton,</hi> to carry him to <hi>White-Hall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Afternoon the Captain was carried by his <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>
to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and examined in the Secretary's Office by my Lord
<hi>Conway,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Jenkins;</hi> and in his Examination, in comes
the King into the Office, as before he had done into the Dutcheſs
of <hi>Portſmouth</hi>'s Chamber, when my Lord <hi>H</hi>—came to kiſs
her Hand, and there the King told the Captain he had ſerved his
Father and him faithfully, and hoped he (the Captain) would
not now decline his Obedience; to which the Captain anſwered,
he never deſerved to be ſuſpected: then the King told him he had
not the Opportunity to ſerve his Friends, but hoped he might:
then the King examined him what he knew of my Lord <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s
having a Deſign againſt his Perſon; but the Captain upon
his Oath denied he knew any thing, ſo the King left him to the
further Examination of Secretary <hi>Jenkins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this Buſineſs did not ſtay here; for the Captain was carried
into another Room, where were preſent the King, my Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,
the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Pemberton,</hi> and ſeveral other of the
Nobility, with <hi>Graham, Baynes</hi> and <hi>Booth;</hi> where my Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
was very ſharp upon the Captain, and put ſeveral Queſtions
to the Captain, which he could not anſwer, and told the Captain,
there were two ſorts of Advancements, and that the Captain was
like to come to his Trial before the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Buſineſs was, <hi>Booth</hi> had ſworn that the Captain had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> for a Troop of fifty Men, to
be my Lord's Guards againſt the King, and that <hi>Booth</hi> was liſted
in it: This <hi>Booth</hi> had ſworn, but was ſo unfortunate in it, as to
ſwear, this was when the Parliament was at <hi>Oxford,</hi> at which
time the Captain was making his Preparations for his intended Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Carolina:</hi> but whether the King believed the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
or <hi>Booth,</hi> is unknown, but it ſtop'd here, and the Captain was
no higher advanced upon <hi>Booth</hi>'s Oath, nor could be prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be a Witneſs againſt my Lord <hi>Shaftbury,</hi> though his Wife was
as much tempted to have it ſo, as the Captain was; ſo the Captain's
only Advancement was, to be remanded to Priſon.</p>
                  <p>However, it was reſolved that my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſhould be
proſecuted, and ſo upon the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> a Bill of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was preferred againſt him to the great Inqueſt at the <hi>Seſſions-Houſe</hi>
                     <pb n="599" facs="tcp:60932:306"/>
in the <hi>Old-Baily:</hi> and <hi>Baines</hi> proved a true Prophet, though
<hi>Booth</hi> ſware to the Captain's Command of Fifty Men, to be a
Guard to my Lord; for the Jury neither believed him nor the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
ſo baffled at <hi>Colledge</hi>'s Trial, nor the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Evidence ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to that, and ſo returned an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Suetonius,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> ſays, he could never have
made ſuch Ravages upon the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and exerciſed ſuch
Cruelties, if he had not been backt by an Officious and flattering
Senate, which carried the Face of Juſtice in it: and tho it be
evident, that for near Eighty Years, theſe three Kings of the
<hi>Scotiſh</hi> Race had been endeavouring to eſtabliſh an Arbitrary and
Tyrannical Government over this Nation, yet except King <hi>James</hi>
the Firſt, who, if his Neceſſities had not forced him, would have
never had a Parliament after the firſt, and who by his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
created ſo many Monopolies, and Benevolences, and in
the Parliament of the <hi>12th</hi> and <hi>18th</hi> Years of his Reign, without
any Colour of Juſtice, impriſoned ſo many worthy Gentlemen,
without the Benefit of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>'s, for their Debates in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
yet theſe other two pretended to raiſe their Tyrannies
under the Form of Juſtice, and therefore <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt after he
for Fifteen Years together, had not only exceeded his Father in
granting Monopolies, and raiſing Money by Loans, Benevolences,
Coat and Conduct Money, but alſo in taking the Cuſtoms without
Grant of Parliament, and ſuch as were never granted by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in further raiſing Ship-Money, and impriſoning the
Members of Parliament without Benefit of their <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>'s;
yet he thought beſt to do it by ſuch Judges as he ſhould make:
So this King, in the Executions of <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> and <hi>Colledge,</hi> would
have the Colour of Juſtice by a Form of Law, for which there
was no Law.</p>
                  <p>But as the Knights of <hi>Malta</hi> could make Knights of their Order
for eight Pence a-piece, yet could not make a Soldier of Sea-man:
So theſe Kings, tho they could make what Judges they pleaſed
to do their Buſineſs, yet could not make a Grand-Jury, from whom
the Judges in all criminal Caſes between the King and Subject
muſt take their Meaſures: theſe Grand-Juries in <hi>London</hi> are return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Sheriffs, and the Sheriffs are choſen by the Livery.</p>
                  <p>This Difficulty after my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Caſe, put the Court
to their Trumps, and at preſent a Stop to their Proceedings: The
Aſſiſtance of the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was neceſſary, but at this time he
was as buſy in <hi>Scotland</hi> about my Lord of <hi>Argyle,</hi> as his Brother
was in <hi>England</hi> about my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The City upon the Diſſolution of the Four laſt Parliaments,
were aware of the Deſigns of the Court, and choſe Sheriffs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly;
when <hi>Colledge</hi>'s Bill was preferred, Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi>
were Sheriffs, and now another ſuch was preferred againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Pilkington</hi> and Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> were She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs;
who, tho at other times Sheriffs would rather fine than
ſerve, yet at this time none refuſed to ſerve, ſo that unleſs She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs
of another Stamp were choſen, all would be to no Purpoſe.
It's ſcarce credible what a Noiſe the not finding my Lord <hi>Shaftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s
Bill made; all Juſtice, now the <hi>Tory Party</hi> cried, was ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
if theſe <hi>Ignoramus Juries</hi> were not ſet aſide: <hi>R. L. S.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
Forty one would inevitably return; and this countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the Court, flew out of the City, all the Country over, ſo
that ſcarce any other thing was to be heard but of <hi>Ignoramus Juries,</hi>
and what would follow from them.</p>
                  <p>It was the latter End of <hi>Michaelmas Term,</hi> the great Inqueſt
returned an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> upon the Bill of High Treaſon preferred
againſt my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and in the Vacation all Wits were ſet
on work how to take the Election of the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> out of
the Power of the City, and no other Expedient could be found out
but by taking away their Charter, which if it could be done, would
not only entitle the Court to making of Sheriffs, but open a Gap
to their making a Houſe of Commons; for near 5/6 of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
are Burgeſſes and Barons of the Cinque Ports, who would
not dare to conteſt their Charters, if the City of <hi>London</hi> could not
hold theirs. So that in <hi>Hilary Term</hi> following, a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi>
was brought againſt the City for two hainous Crimes, <hi>viz.</hi> That
they had made an Addreſs to the King for the Parliament to ſit
for Redreſs of Grievances, and to ſettle the Nation, (yet King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt thought the Parliament's Vote of <hi>non-Addreſſes</hi>
to him, was a Depoſing of him) and that the City had raiſed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
towards repairing <hi>Cheapſide</hi> Conduit, ruined by the Fire of
<hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The City pleaded their Right, and the King replied, upon which
there was a Demurrer, but Judgment was not given upon it till
<hi>Trinity Term</hi> 1683. However the Novelty of the thing cauſed an
Amuſement upon the Generality of the City and Nation too,
whereto this tended. In the mean time the Duke having done
his Work in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was returned to <hi>London,</hi> and his Zeal for
promoting the <hi>Catholick</hi> Cauſe, outwent his Patience for the Court's
Judgment upon the Demurrer to the <hi>Quo Warranto;</hi> ſo that
Courtiers of the Firſt Magnitude appeared barefaced for the next
Election of Sheriffs, and Sir <hi>Dudley North</hi> (Sir <hi>Francis</hi>'s own Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
and Sir <hi>Peter Rich</hi> were returned, one by a ſhameleſs Trick,
the other by open Force. Tho the Court had gained this Point,
they thought not fit to puſh it further till the Demurrer to the
City Charter were determined, in which ſuch Haſte was made,
that only two Arguments were permitted on either Side, one in
<hi>Hilary Term 1682-83,</hi> and the other in <hi>Eaſter Term</hi> following, and ſo
Judgment was given in <hi>Trinity Term</hi> next after, againſt the City.</p>

                     <pb n="601" facs="tcp:60932:307"/>
The Judgment againſt the City was as ſtrange as the Election
of the Sheriffs, for it was without any Reaſon, and by two Judges
only; one was Sir <hi>Francis Withens</hi> (who had heard but one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
and I believe underſtood but little of that) and who after,
in the Abſence of Sir <hi>Edward Herbert,</hi> delivered that for his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> when preſent, diſowned; and Sir <hi>Thomas
Jones.</hi> However, they ſaid Juſtice <hi>Raimond</hi> was of their Opinion,
and ſo was <hi>Saunders,</hi> the Chief Juſtice, tho he was paſt his Senſes,
and only had Senſe enough to expoſtulate with them for then
troubling him, when he had loſt his Memory.</p>
                  <p>But the Court of <hi>Kings Bench</hi> were not ſo ripe for this haſty Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as that at <hi>White-Hall</hi> was for Diſcovery of Plots againſt the
Government and Juſtice of the Nation; of which they ſet three
on Foot: <hi>viz.</hi> A Plot to ſurprize the Guards; the Rye-Plot, to
murder the King and Duke as they ſhould come from <hi>New-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket;</hi>
and the <hi>Black-Heath</hi> Plot, for the People to riſe upon a Foot-Ball
Match: if thoſe Sheriffs would not do the Court's Work, you
may be ſure the next ſhould, where the King ſhould have the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
but theſe were as truſty as any the King could make,
and it was now <hi>Graham</hi> and <hi>Burton</hi>'s Work to find Good <hi>Jury-Men,</hi>
and then the Sheriffs would be ſure to return them.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe Plots, for ought I can find, the Fox was the Finder;
my Lord <hi>H</hi>—and <hi>Rumſey,</hi> in that of the Guards; <hi>Lee</hi> and
<hi>Goodenough</hi> in that of <hi>Black-Heath; Keeling</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> in that of
the Rye-Plot. <hi>Lee</hi> was ſet to trapan <hi>Rouſe</hi> and <hi>Baker</hi> in the <hi>Black-Heath</hi>
Plot. <hi>Rumball</hi> (at whoſe Houſe 'twas ſaid the Rye-Plot was
to be acted) upon his Death denied he ever knew of any. But
the Great Deſign was upon my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi>
one the moſt eminent of the Nobility, for his great Honour, and
all eminent Vertues; the other of the Commons; and both zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Proteſtants, and Opponents to the Deſign of introducing
Popery and Arbitrary Power.</p>
                  <p>I will not again curtail Mr. <hi>Hawles</hi>'s learned Remarks upon my
Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Trial, on the Thirteenth of <hi>July,</hi> 1683. yet I muſt
obſerve, how that that Day, whether my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
or was to be killed, the King and his Brother were both in
the Tower when the Act was done, and immediately Notice was
ſent to the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> to give Notice of it to the Court, that in the
worſt Senſe, Uſe might be made of it by the King's Counſel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
my Lord <hi>Ruſſel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Blaze of the Earl's having murdered himſelf, having had
its deſigned Effect upon my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Trial, the next Step
was to ſatisfy the Nation the Earl murdered himſelf; and to this
Purpoſe the Coroner's Inqueſt muſt neceſſarily ſit, and give their
Verdict; but ſo the Buſineſs was ordered, that before the Jury
was impannelled, the Earl's Body was taken out of the Cloſet
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:60932:308"/>
(where 'twas pretended he murdered himſelf) and ſtript of his
Clothes which were carried away, and the Cloſet waſht; and
when one of the Jury inſiſted upon ſeeing my Lord's Clothes in
which he died, the Coroner was ſent for into another Room, and
upon his Return, told the Jury, it was my Lord's Body, not his
Clothes, they were to ſit upon: and when it was moved that the
Jury ſhould adjourn, and give my Lord's Relations Notice, Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The King had ſent for the Inquiſition, and would not riſe from the

                     </gap>
the Coroner's Inqueſt found Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> died a Natural
Death in the <hi>Tower,</hi> that two Years after, when <hi>Reves,</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary's
Servant, made the firſt Diſcovery of Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his being
poiſoned, that <hi>Reves</hi> was proſecuted for flying in the Face of the
Government, and queſtioning the Juſtice of the Nation, as Mr.
<hi>Speke</hi> and Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> were for endeavouring to diſcover the
Murder of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> I'm ſure their Inducement for the
Proofs of it, were manifoldly more than <hi>Reves</hi>'s were of Sir <hi>Thomas
Overbury</hi>'s; and I wiſh I underſtood what their Crimes were more
than <hi>Reves</hi>'s: but that being for the King and <hi>Juſtice of the Nation,</hi>
they ought to have been encouraged, if there had been no foul
dealing in the Earl's Death.</p>
                  <p>After the Death of theſe Noble Perſons, the reſt of the Game
was plaid without ſcarce any Rub: Colonel <hi>Sidney, Bateman, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot,
Hone</hi> and <hi>Rouſe,</hi> followed for Treaſon all, and all of different
Complexions; and where Treaſon could have no Colour, actually
to take away the Lives of the Opponents of Popery and Arbitrary
Power, Miſdemeanours are ſet on foot to take away their Means of
living; Fines from 10000 to 100000 <hi>l.</hi> for words againſt the Duke;
though by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> a <hi>Salvo Contenemento</hi> is reſerved for
Miſdemeanors againſt the King. <hi>Graham</hi> and <hi>Burton</hi> would find
Juries for all, and the Sheriffs would return them to do the
Work.</p>
                  <p>But the Rage and Tyranny againſt the Opponents of Popery and
Arbitrary Power, was not more illegal than the Indulgence to the
Lords impeached by Parliament; for the King reſolving to have
no more Parliaments, upon the preſent Conſtitution, made Judges
to take Bail for them to appear next Parliament: Hereby as much
invading the Rights and Juriſdiction of Parliament, as the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
againſt <hi>Fitz-Harris, Colledge,</hi> my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Colonel <hi>Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
&amp;c. were illegal; which though at Common Law they might
have been Treaſon, yet by the Statute of the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi>
the Third, the Judges in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> were prohibited to
take Cogniſance of them, and by the Act of 13 <hi>Car. 2. c.</hi> 51.
wherein the Proſecution ought to be within Six Months
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:60932:308"/>
after the Fact, and the Indictment within three Months after.</p>
                  <p>Though the City of <hi>London,</hi> and many other Cities in <hi>England,</hi>
thoſe their Sheriffs; yet the Sheriffs of all the other Shires and
Counties of <hi>England</hi> were named by the King: ſo that the
King's next care was how to ſubvert the Conſtitution of <hi>Parliament,</hi>
and like <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> have a Houſe of Commons of his own
making: For the Houſe of Commons is compunded of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and thirteen Members, whereof but ninety two are Knights
of Shires; ſo that near 5/6 are Burgreſſes, Citizens and Barons of
the Cinque Ports: The Generality of the Corporations which ſend
theſe Members are poor decayed places, and ſo not able as the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>London</hi> to conteſt their Charters, or if they could, they had
little hope to keep them, now <hi>London</hi> could not hold theirs. Yet
this would coſt the Court a great deal of time to bring <hi>Quo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto's</hi>
againſt above two hundred Corporations; and now all
Hands are ſet at work to prevail upon theſe poor Inhabitants, and
mighty Rewards are promiſed to thoſe who ſhould ſurrender
them: but becauſe Money was ſcarce, Bargains were made with
Multitudes of them, to have Grants of Fairs for ſurrender of their
Charters, and thoſe which refuſed had <hi>Quo Warranto's</hi> brought
againſt them.</p>
                  <p>To humour the Court, and in perfect hope that in time the
Mountains would bring forth, a Multitude of Corporations (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſome looſe vain Men, who aſſumed the Names of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations)
by heaps ſurrendred their Charters; and at exceſſive
Rates (I cannot ſay renewed, but) took new ones, whereby the King
reſerved to himſelf the Power of diſpoſing of all Places of Profit
and Power, which at preſent was intruſted in their Hands who had
betrayed their former Truſt: nor did theſe Men care for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of purchaſing their new Charter, tho it were to the ſtarving
the Poor of their Corporations, who ſhould have been fed with the
Monies expended in the Purchaſe.</p>
                  <p>But a Multitude of lewd Fellows, who in meaner Corporations,
were all as willing to betray their Charters as the Richer, yet had
not Money to purchaſe new ones, and without it nothing could
be had, and never was King furniſhed with ſuch a Lord Keeper
(for by this time <hi>North,</hi> who had drawn the King's Declaration
againſt petitioning for a Parliament, and for which he was impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Parliament, and had ſo highly merited in <hi>Colledge</hi>'s Trial,
was made Lord Keeper) and Attorney General for taking Money
with both Hands; though by their Oaths they ought to have, to
the beſt of their Skill, informed the King of the Juſtice and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of all thoſe things which were to paſs the Seals: and this
put ſome ſtop to the hurry of the ſurrender of Charters.</p>
                  <p>But in theſe Corporations there were ſome Members, who
made a Conſcience of their Oaths, and betraying their Truſts,
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:60932:309"/>
and according to the Obligation to both, performed their Duties;
but theſe were proſecuted as Rioters and Tumultuous Perſons, and
fined extravagantly, even to their undoing, and impriſoned till
payment, and bound to their good Behaviour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe things were not carried on with that Security, but ſome
Umbrages of fear there were, that ſome Diſturbances might ariſe
before they could be brought to Perfection: to quell them, if
they ſhould happen,</hi> The Duke had ſecured <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had 20000
Foot and 2000 Horſe, and a Year's Pay, to be aſſiſting upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;

thoſe which humour'd them in their Pleaſures, and were of free

Unlike his Father, who while he did what he would, was

in profuſe Prodigality to his Favourites, but unlike his Father

War, whereby he was enabled to continue the War againſt
the <hi>Dutch</hi> two Years longer than he did, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> otherwiſe
might have fired the Ships in our Harbours a Year ſooner, and
forced the King to a more inglorious Peace than that he made in
the Year 1667, whilſt the Parliament, in the Temper it was in,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Objection.</hi> If the King has Power to diſpenſe with the Act of
Navigation, by the ſame Reaſon he may diſpenſe with other Laws;
and ſo the Laws of the Nation will be looſe, and ſubject to the King's
Will at his Pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer</hi> I. I wiſh all Legiſlators in paſſing Laws would be of
another Temper than when the <hi>Rump</hi> made this Law, which was
in ſpight of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> without any Conſideration of the dreadful
Conſequences it has brought upon the Nation both within and
without; or in another Temper than the Parliament was in in the
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:60932:310"/>
twelfth Year of the King, when they paſſed or confirmed this Law
without any conſideration of Times, whether in War or Peace.</p>
                     <p>II. If the Act of Navigation had been in general a good Law,
yet Times muſt be diſtinguiſhed; and in War, Civil Laws are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent:
ſo that for the Preſervation of the Publick, the King may
deſtroy particular Mens Intereſt, as in caſe of firing the Suburbs
of a City to preſerve the City, and deſtroy the Fruits of the
Ground rather than theſe ſhall ſuſtain an Enemy to the endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the whole Nation: but it was much more reaſonable for the
King to grant Liberty, without any Deſtruction or Wrong to his
Subjects, to diſpenſe with the Act of Navigation, and give all Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
Liberty to import Gunpowder and all ſorts of Naval
Scores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Nation's Preſervation in the time of War with
the <hi>Dutch.</hi> And, I ſay, it was Prudence in <hi>Oliver,</hi> tho in time of
Peace, to diſpenſe with the Act of Navigation in reference to the
Trade to <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> after the <hi>Norway</hi> Merchants had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to him, how grievouſly the <hi>Norwegians,</hi> by this Act im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon not only the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, but upon <hi>Oliver</hi> himſelf,
in building and fitting up his Men of War.</p>
                     <p>2. The ſecond better Act of King <hi>Charles,</hi> was his diſpenſing
with the Law againſt Foreigners partaking the Benefits of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-born
Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> by permitting <hi>Brewer</hi> and his <hi>Walloons</hi>
(tho Papiſts) after they fled from the Rage of the <hi>French</hi> Ravages
in <hi>Flanders</hi> in 1667, to plant and ſettle themſelves in the <hi>West;</hi>
whereby the <hi>Engliſh</hi> became inſtructed how to make and dye fine
Woollen Cloths 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi> cheaper than they could before: and
herein the King imitated two of his moſt glorious Predeceſſors that
ever reigned in <hi>England,</hi> I mean <hi>Edward</hi> III. and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
Princes who no ways affected Tyranny or Arbitrary Power.</p>
                     <p>I ſay the King might juſtly and legally do this; for tho the King
cannot diſpenſe with Laws which have a complicated Intereſt with
himſelf and Subjects, to the Wrong of his Subjects; yet the King
may diſpenſe with thoſe Penalties which properly belong to him,
even in criminal Caſes, as to the Life and Eſtate of an Offender,
and therefore much more where there is no Offence, and the End
for the publick Good: as in this Caſe of <hi>Brewer,</hi> and all other
Foreigners, the Penalty is, if they trade, they ſhall pay Strangers
Duties; but this is to the King; and if he pleaſes, he may take
to other Duties than his natural-born Subjects pay, whereby the
Foreign and Fiſhing Trades which are carried on in <hi>Holland</hi> might
not be carried out of <hi>England,</hi> and thereby the Navigation of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
become double or treble to what it now is, and the ruined
and even deſolate Coaſt-Towns of <hi>England</hi> flouriſh, as <hi>Hamburgh,
Amſterdam, Gottenburgh, Diep, St. Maloes,</hi> and other Ports. Would
not this be not only for the enriching, but ſtrengthning the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:60932:311"/>
and that in a double Proportion? for we ſhould be ſo much
more rich and ſtrong here, as other Nations would be leſs, and in
a worſe ſtate to make War upon us. Nay, ſhould we only make
our Ports free, as <hi>Leghorn, Marſeilles,</hi> and as of late the Pope has
<hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi> would not the Nation be ſo much more enriched as
the Goods imported are more? I would know from whence elſe it
was that <hi>France</hi> became ſo enriched above all other Countries (for
Mines they have none) but from the vaſt Trades the <hi>Engliſh,
Dutch, Swedes,</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> drove in <hi>France?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſuppoſe the King ſhould diſpenſe with Foreigners purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Lands in <hi>England,</hi> and not take them, as he may do if he
pleaſes, whereby Millions of Money would be brought into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the Lands we ſhall have ſtill; and would not the Nation be
ſo much more enriched hereby as the Purchaſe-Monies are more?
And would not the Nation be ſo much more peopled and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
as the Purchaſers are more? and the King's Revenue by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
and Cuſtoms ſo much more encreaſed, as the Conſumption of
theſe and their Deſcendants ſhall be more? Merchants, to enrich
themſelves and the Nation, run great Hazards, and are often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
in their Merchandizing; whereas the Nation, nor any Man
elſe, runs any Hazard by Foreigners purchaſing Lands in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ambitious Princes, to acquire more Subjects, run great Hazard,
and deſtroy and make Men miſerable, and ruin Countries, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
their Deſigns; whereas none of theſe attend the Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Foreigners to trade and inhabit among us: and when they
are once ſettled, theirs and the Nation's Intereſt will be the ſame,
and both alike obliged to defend them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Xenophon,</hi> in <hi>Cyropaedia,</hi> ſays, That by reaſon of the Goodneſs
and Juſtice of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Reign, many Nations became his Subjects.
Will any ſay <hi>Cyrus</hi> was leſs a King hereby? Or ſhould we be leſs a
Nation, if by the Benefit of our many Advantages in Trade we
ſhould by others encreaſe our Trade, which we cannot of our
ſelves? Nay, ſhould we not ſo much more enrich and ſtrengthen
our ſelves? When I conſider theſe things, I wonder Foreigners
ſhould be at ſuch Charges to purchaſe their Freedom by an Act of
Parliament, whenas the King may do it if he pleaſes; unleſs it be
that their Poſterity ſhall not inherit: but if the King may permit
Foreigners to purchaſe without taking the Forfeitures, or grant
them a Licence to purchaſe, he may grant them a Licence to ſettle
their Eſtates as they pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>3. The third good Act of K. <hi>Charles,</hi> was his marrying the late
Queen to his preſent Majeſty, tho by the manner of it, it ſeems
to me he did it by Surprize; and I'm apt to believe, if he could
well have come off from it again he would, as appears by the Story.</p>
                     <p>4. We may add this fourth, That he bred up the late Queen
and her Siſter after the Religion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

DETECTION
OF THE
Court and State of England,
DURING THE
REIGN
OF
King JAMES II, &amp;c.</head>
               <head type="sub">BOOK V.</head>
               <p>WHAT before King <hi>Charles</hi> II. acted in Maſquerade,
King <hi>James</hi> did bare-fac'd; and here you'll ſee
how plain and eaſy a Paſſage the <hi>Abſolute Will and
Pleaſure-Men,</hi> and <hi>Paſſive Obedience-Men</hi> had made
for this King to overthrow the whole Church and State of <hi>England,</hi>
and by what ſteps he proceeded in it; the King's Speeches looking
one way, and he going quite contrary.</p>
               <p>Upon the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> in 1684/85. the Day of his Brother's
Death, the King declared in Council, That ſince it had pleaſed
God to place him in that Station, to ſucceed ſo good and gracious
a King, as well as ſo kind a Brother; that he thinks fit to declare
his Endeavours to follow his Brother's Example, more eſpecially
in that of his great Clemency and Tenderneſs to his People, and
make it his Endeavour to preſerve the Government both in Church
and State, as it is by Law eſtabliſhed; Commends the Church of
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:60932:312"/>
                  <hi>England</hi>'s Principles and Members; knows likewiſe, that the Laws
of <hi>England</hi> are ſufficient to make the King as great a Monarch as he
can wiſh; and therefore, as he will never depart from the juſt
Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown, ſo he will never invade any
Man's Property.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>Sunday</hi> after his Brother's Death, the King went pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
to Maſs, and that Week (I think) he order'd his Brother's
dying in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and before his
Death, his receiving his <hi>Viaticum,</hi> and other Ceremonies of that
Church, and atteſted by Father <hi>Huddleſton,</hi> to be printed; and
alſo the Papers taken out of the King's Strong-box, ſhewing, that
however he outwardly appeared otherwiſe in his Life, yet in his
Heart he was ſincerely a true <hi>Roman Catholick:</hi> So that however
he promiſed to preſerve the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as by Law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
yet his Profeſſion was of the Church of <hi>Rome, which cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and declares them Hereticks, Schiſmaticks,
and Sacrilegious Perſons, with whom no Faith is to be kept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King's Father, <hi>Charles</hi> I, took the Cuſtoms before granted
by Parliament; this King took both Cuſtoms and the Exciſe, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
only for the Life of his Brother, before they were given him
by Parliament: How this correſponded with the King's Promiſe
but the Week before, that he would never invade any Man's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
I do not underſtand; for tho in every Government no Man
has Property againſt the Supream Power, yet by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
the Supream Power of the Nation is in the Parliament,
in Conjunction with the King: and the King's taking both the
Cuſtoms and Temporary Exciſe for his Brother's Life, by his only
Will and Pleaſure, was as much a Violation upon the Property of
the Subject, as if he had taken the reſt of their Goods and Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances.</p>
               <p>To the King's Promiſe of preſerving the Church and State of
<hi>England</hi> as by Law eſtabliſhed, he adds, That he will imitate his
kind Brother in his great Clemency, and Tenderneſs of his People.</p>
               <p>The firſt Act of the King's Clemency and Tenderneſs to his
People, was extended to Dr. <hi>Oates;</hi> but tho the Act was compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this King's Reign, the Scene was laid in his good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Brother's, when <hi>Oates</hi> was Fined 100000 <hi>l.</hi> for <hi>Scandalum
Magnatum</hi> againſt the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> in ſaying, <hi>The Duke was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to the Church of</hi> Rome, and to be kept cloſe Priſoner till
the Fine was paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oates</hi> being thus mew'd up, upon the King's coming to the
Crown an Indictment of Perjury is contrived againſt him upon
two Points; one, That <hi>Ireland</hi> was not in <hi>London</hi> from the <hi>3d</hi> of
<hi>August</hi> in 1678, till the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> next following; when
<hi>Oates,</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Trial, ſaid, <hi>He was in a Conſult concerning the
killing the King, about the middle of</hi> Auguſt: The other was, That
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:60932:312"/>
                  <hi>Oates</hi> was at St. <hi>Omers</hi> all <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> in 1678; when <hi>Oates,</hi>
in <hi>Harcourt</hi> and <hi>Whitebread</hi>'s, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Trials ſwore, <hi>They were at a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
the</hi> 24th <hi>of</hi> April, <hi>concerning killing the King, and eſtabliſhing
the Popiſh Religion.</hi> But that a better View may be had of this
Trial of <hi>Oates,</hi> it's fit to look back into King <hi>Charles</hi> II's Reign.</p>
               <p>It ſeems evident to me, That after the Diſſolution of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
at <hi>Oxford,</hi> (and I believe it will to any other that ſhall
read King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Hiſtory) that he deſigned never after to have
another Parliament, until he ſhould get the Corporations to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
their Charters, ſo as they ſhould elect no other Members
than pleaſed him; and in the mean time to take off the Heads of
thoſe who were zealous in proſecuting the Popiſh Plot.</p>
               <p>Upon the Diſſolution of the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Feuds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Whigs</hi> and <hi>Tories</hi> were in higheſt Ferment; ſo that
whatever was done againſt the <hi>Whigs,</hi> was cried up by the <hi>Tories,</hi>
and Addreſſes made by them to the King, that they would live
and die with him, in them. And becauſe the <hi>Whigs</hi> (as they
were called) would not find Bills againſt my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>
and <hi>Colledge,</hi> they reſolved to carry the Election of Sheriffs in 1682,
wherein Mr. <hi>Dubois</hi> and Mr. <hi>Papillon (Whigs)</hi> ſtood Candidates
againſt Sir <hi>Peter Rich</hi> and Sir <hi>Dudley North (Tories);</hi> but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
by Right or Wrong <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>North</hi> ſhould carry it, and ſo
they did; but by what Right, you may judg by the Prints.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tories</hi> having gained this Point, Sir <hi>R. S. Gra.</hi> and <hi>Burt.</hi>
are Inſtruments for packing Juries; the Judges, <hi>North, Pemberton,</hi>
and <hi>Saunders,</hi> &amp;c. ſhall do their parts for declaring Charters void,
and for Trying <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi>
Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But the taking off the Heads of the <hi>Whigs</hi> was but half this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;
the impeached Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> muſt be let looſe, or the
Game was but half play'd: This was ſo tickliſh a Point, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Pemberton</hi> nor <hi>Saunders</hi> could be brought up to it; but <hi>Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
dying, and <hi>Pemberton</hi> removed to the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> Sir <hi>Geo.
Jeffries</hi> was ſet up to do this Work, which he did to content, and
ſo was initiated to do what other Journey-work the Court ſhould
order. And now before him <hi>Oates</hi> is to be tried for Perjury, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the two Points aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ireland</hi> was tried above ſix Years before, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>December</hi> 1678,
before a Jury of Judges in the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> and ſo was <hi>Whitebread</hi>
and <hi>Harcourt</hi> within about a Month leſs than ſix Years, <hi>viz.</hi> in
<hi>June 1679. Ireland</hi> pleaded he was not in <hi>London</hi> from the <hi>3d</hi> of
<hi>August</hi> till the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>September;</hi> and <hi>Whitebread, Harcourt,</hi> &amp;c.
pleaded that <hi>Oates</hi> was at St. <hi>Omers</hi> all <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> in 1678; ſo
that if their Witneſſes ſaid true, 'twas impoſſible <hi>Oates</hi>'s Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Whitebread</hi>'s being at the Conſult in <hi>April,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>'s in
<hi>August,</hi> could be true.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="612" facs="tcp:60932:313"/>
That <hi>Oates</hi> was in Town in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> in 1678, was proved
by Sir <hi>Richard Barker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> a Miniſter, Mr. <hi>Clay</hi> a <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Prieſt, Mrs. <hi>Mayo, Sarah Ives,</hi> Mr. <hi>Smith (Oates</hi>'s Schoolmaſter,
with whom <hi>Oates</hi> dined about the Beginning of <hi>May)</hi> Mr. <hi>Page,</hi>
and <hi>Butler</hi> (Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s Coachman.) But beſides <hi>Oates</hi>
and <hi>Bedlow</hi>'s ſwearing <hi>Ireland</hi> was at the Conſult in <hi>August,</hi> only
<hi>Sarah Pain</hi> (who had been Servant to <hi>Grove,</hi> one of the Jeſuits)
ſwore <hi>Ireland</hi> was in Town in <hi>August.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oates</hi> thus mew'd up, the <hi>St. Omers</hi> Boys are ſent for over in
all haſte (and you need not doubt had new Inſtructions) and the
Crew of <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> Witneſſes: the Boys to ſwear <hi>Oates</hi> was at
<hi>St. Omers</hi> all <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May;</hi> the <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> Witneſſes, that <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> or thereabouts, in <hi>August</hi> and <hi>September.
Jeffries</hi> was the Judg, and you need not doubt of a Jury, to chime
into <hi>Jeffries</hi> ſumming up the Evidence.</p>
               <p>Things ſtanding in this Poſture, <hi>Oates</hi> is tried upon the <hi>9th</hi> of
<hi>May</hi> upon Perjury, upon theſe two Points. At the Trial, <hi>Oates</hi>
could get only four Witneſſes to appear, (and 'twas a Wonder he
could get any) <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> the Miniſter, who after ſo long
time, durſt not truſt to his Memory, to ſwear poſitively <hi>Oates</hi>
was in Town, unleſs he ſhould have the Minutes of his Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before; and ſo Mr. <hi>Page;</hi> but <hi>Mayo</hi> and <hi>Butler</hi> both ſwore
<hi>Oates</hi> was in Town: but unleſs <hi>Sarah Pain</hi> could be found, 'twas
impoſſible for <hi>Oates</hi> to prove <hi>Ireland</hi> was in Town in <hi>August,</hi> for
<hi>Bedlow</hi> was dead, and <hi>Oates</hi> could not ſwear for himſelf.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Ex tempore verum naſcitur. Ireland</hi> was Confeſſor to Mr.
<hi>John Jeniſon,</hi> Father of Mr. <hi>Thomas Jeniſon,</hi> (a Jeſuit in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy,
and who died in <hi>Newgate)</hi> elder Brother of Mr. <hi>Robert
Jeniſon:</hi> This Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> having been at <hi>Windſor</hi> in <hi>August</hi> 1678,
came from thence to <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Chamber the <hi>19th,</hi> and found him
pulling off his Boots on the Frame of a Table, being newly come
from <hi>Staffordſhire. Ireland</hi> ask'd him from whence he came? who
told him, from <hi>Windſor. Ireland</hi> enquired about the Diverſions of
the Court; <hi>Jeniſon</hi> ſaid, His Majeſty's chief Delight was in Hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Fiſhing, accompanied only with two or three, early in the
Morning: How eaſily then might he be taken off! anſwer'd <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Then <hi>Ireland</hi> asked Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> if he would be aſſiſting in
taking off the King? which if he would, <hi>Ireland</hi> ſaid he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
him 20 <hi>l.</hi> which he owed <hi>Ireland.</hi> Afterwards <hi>Ireland</hi> ask'd
him if he knew any <hi>Iriſh</hi>-men, who were courageous and ſtout?
<hi>Jeniſon</hi> told him he knew Captain <hi>Levallian, Kerney, Broghall,</hi> and
<hi>Wilſon:</hi> then <hi>Ireland</hi> ask'd him if he would go along with theſe,
and aſſiſt in taking off the King? which he refuſing, <hi>Ireland</hi> ſaid
he knew <hi>Levallian</hi> and <hi>Kerney,</hi> and ſet down the other two Names
in writing, and ſaid he was going to the Club to Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Levallian,</hi> and <hi>Kerney;</hi> and dunn'd Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> for the 20 <hi>l.</hi>
                  <pb n="613" facs="tcp:60932:313"/>
which he owed <hi>Ireland:</hi> but <hi>Ireland,</hi> at his Death, denying he
was in Town, from the third of <hi>Auguſt</hi> till the fourteenth of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> changed his Religion upon it, and printed
the Reaſon; and after upon his Oath at my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Trial
declared this, and a farther Account of the Conſpiracy againſt the
King, and for introducing the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion.</p>
               <p>If living Teſtimonies ſhall be doubted, yet I conceive I ſhall put
it out of doubt, that <hi>Ireland</hi> was in Town, when his <hi>Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>
Witneſſes ſaid he was in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> by a Proof which
could not be bribed or corrupted.</p>
               <p>One Mr. <hi>Benjamin Hinton,</hi> a Goldſmith in <hi>Lombard-ſtreet,</hi> was <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s
Caſhier; and Mr. <hi>Hinton</hi> going out of Town at that time in
<hi>Aug.</hi> 1678, met <hi>Ireland</hi> at or about <hi>Barnet,</hi> coming for <hi>London,</hi>
when <hi>Ireland</hi> told him, that he had extraordinary Occaſions for
Money, and urged <hi>Hinton</hi> to go back with him; but <hi>Hinton</hi> told
him, his Man could do <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Buſineſs as well as he, and his
Occaſions would not permit him to go back. I asked Mr. <hi>Hinton</hi>
the Truth of this, to which he would not give me any Anſwer;
but be this true or falſe, it's entred into <hi>Hinton</hi>'s Book of Accompts,
<hi>paid to Mr.</hi> Ireland'<hi>s own Hands,</hi> whereas the other Entries are,
<hi>paid by his Order:</hi> and 'tis ſaid Mr. <hi>Hinton</hi>'s Man would depoſe he
paid theſe Monies to <hi>Ireland</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hinton</hi> afterwards failing, a Commiſſion of <hi>Bankrupt</hi> was
ſued againſt him, and his Book of Accompts was delivered, and
kept at the Widow <hi>Vernon</hi>'s Coffee-houſe in <hi>Bartholomew Lane,</hi> on
the back ſide of the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> where any Man may ſee the
Truth of this Entry. I am aſſured Mr. <hi>Hinton</hi> was in Court at
<hi>Oates</hi> his Trial, to have teſtified this, but was terrified from it
for fear of being undone.</p>
               <p>However <hi>Oates</hi> was found guilty of Perjury upon both Points
in this Trial, before <hi>Jefferies</hi> and his Brethren; and his Sentence
was to be whipt from <hi>Aldgate</hi> to <hi>Newgate,</hi> the next <hi>Wedneſday</hi> after,
and the <hi>Friday</hi> after (but a Day between) from <hi>Newgate</hi> to <hi>Tyburn,</hi>
which was put in Execution with the utmoſt Rigour; the Stripes
of the firſt Whipping being ſo ſore and green upon the ſecond,
that few other Men could have undergone the ſecond; to ſtand in
the Pillory five times in the Year, and to be a Priſoner during
Life, which was as cloſe as his Whipping was ſevere. This was
the firſt Act of this King's Clemency and Tenderneſs to his People,
in Imitation of his good, gracious and kind Brother, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any general Pardon (as is uſual upon Kings coming to their
Crowns) or the Parliament had met: but it might be eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaged
whereto this tended; and tho it began with <hi>Oates,</hi> yet <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerfield</hi>
underwent as ſevere a Puniſhment, with a worſe Fate, for
diſcovering the <hi>Meal-Tub</hi> Plot, to have thrown the Popiſh Plot
upon the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="614" facs="tcp:60932:314"/>
Theſe were the Preparations which King <hi>James</hi> made before
the Parliament met, to demonſtrate to the World and them, how
ſincerely he had made good his Promiſe to his Privy Council, That
he would never invade any Man's Property, and imitate his good
and gracious Brother in his great Clemency and Tenderneſs to his
People; and make it his Endeavours to preſerve the Government
both in Church and State, as it was eſtabliſhed by Law: By Law;
no new Laws can be made, nor old ones repealed, or the Subject
taxed, but by Parliament. But Flatterers in this King's Father,
and Grand-father's Reign, aſcribed theſe Powers to the King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Conſent in Parliament, and that Obedience was due to their
Abſolute Will and Pleaſure; and the Paraſites of this King and
his Brother did the ſame, but under a new Doctrine, termed
<hi>Paſſive Obedience:</hi> but theſe Princes not truſting to this, would
make a Parliament <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> and by corrupting them in their
Principles, ruin the Being of them, and ſo to be at the ſole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
of the Prince.</p>
               <p>The Houſe of Commons is made up of 513 Members, whereof
92 are Knights of Shires and Counties, the reſt are Citizens, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes,
and Barons of the <hi>Cinque Ports,</hi> ſo as the Knights of the
Shires are not near one Fourth of the Houſe of Commons. The
King creates the Temporal Lords in Parliament, and names the
Spiritual: ſo that if the King can make the Members of Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to give up their Charters, and take ſuch as he ſhall grant,
it will be in his Power to make above ⅘ of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
               <p>The Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> being diſſolved, the Contrivance of
the Court was to play this Game; but becauſe <hi>Quo Warranto</hi>'s
againſt all the Charters in <hi>England,</hi> tho the King had made Judges,
and the Sheriffs would be ſure to return ſuch Juries as ſhould be
ſure to do the Work, would take up ſo much time, as King <hi>Charles</hi>
ſhould never live to enjoy the Fruits of his Deſign;</p>
               <p>'Twas therefore contrived, that after the Court had got <hi>North</hi>
and <hi>Rich</hi> Sheriffs to return ſuch Juries as ſhould do their Work,
to begin at the City of <hi>London;</hi> and if the Court could have Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt their Charter, few or none of the other Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
would preſume to abide the Conteſt.</p>
               <p>So ſaid, ſo done; for in <hi>Trinity-Term,</hi> in 1682, Judgment was
given againſt the City Charter, yet there were three remarkable
Obſervations upon it: Firſt, It was without any Precedent. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
It was by two Judges only, and but two Arguments upon
it, and no Reaſon given of it: And Thirdly, it was uſhered in
but two Days before, by pretending the diſcovering of a Plot to
amuſe the Nation; ſo as no Man preſumed to take notice of the
Legality of this Judgment, for fear of being proſecuted for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigning
the Juſtice of the Nation, and flying in the Face of the
Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="615" facs="tcp:60932:314"/>
Hereupon Swarms of the richer Sort of Corporations ſurrendred
their Charters, and took new ones, as the King pleaſed, and paid
dear for them, and the King in return of their Kindneſs granted
them new Fairs and Markets; but tho the richer Sort of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations
could pay the Keeper <hi>North,</hi> and Attorney <hi>Sawyer</hi> ſound
Fees for their Purchaſe, yet a Multitude of the meaner Sort could
not come to their Price, and without Money no <hi>New Charters</hi>
could be had, which put a Rub to the compleating this Work in
King <hi>Charles</hi> his time; yet the good Will of the Members of theſe
petty Corporations was not leſs.</p>
               <p>The King's Care for the Knights of Shires, was leſs than for the
Corporations; for the Sheriffs, Lords, and Deputy-Lieutenants,
and Juſtices of Peace being of the King's Nomination, and the
<hi>Tory</hi> Party having perfectly ſubdued the <hi>Whigs,</hi> the King by the
ſame Power which made <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Rich</hi> Sheriffs, could have what
Knights of Shires he pleaſed.</p>
               <p>King <hi>James</hi> made good his Word he promiſed his Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
that he would never depart from the juſt Rights and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the Crown; (of which no Queſtion is to be made, but
thoſe which his good and gracious Brother had left him poſſeſt of,
were the principal) and how haſty ſoever he was after in his
Actions, yet he took great Care how to exerciſe the Prerogative his
Brother aſſumed in modelling Corporations, to improve it to his
utmoſt Advantage; and therefore, though his Brother died upon
the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1684-85, yet no Parliament met till the <hi>19th</hi>
of <hi>May,</hi> and then they did not ſit to act before the <hi>28th,</hi> which
is much more than threefold the time from the iſſuing out of the
Writs, and the 40 Days of their Meeting.</p>
               <p>In the mean time all Hands are ſet on work to chuſe ſuch
Members as ſhould do the Court's Work; they were ſure enough
of ſuch Corporations as had ſurrendred their Charters, and bought
new ones; the beggarly ones, which could not come up to the
Price of renewing their Charters, were graciouſly promiſed to have
new ones <hi>Gratis,</hi> as they after had, if they behaved themſelves
well in the Choice of their Members: The Lords and Deputy-Lieutenants
were as imperious in the Choice of Knights of the
Shire, as my Lord Mayor was in the Choice of <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Rich</hi> for
Sheriffs. But that we may take a better View of the Acts of the
Parliament of King <hi>James,</hi> it's fit to conſider how the Caſe ſtood
with the King.</p>
               <p>King <hi>James</hi> while he was Duke of <hi>York,</hi> was obſerved to be
conſtant to his Word, and a true Friend, which made him more
courted than his Brother; he had a Revenue of near 150000 <hi>l.
per An.</hi> and was a frugal and careful manager of it; and this he
brought as an Acceſſion to the Crown, when he became King: K.
<hi>Charles</hi> had more built, and better furniſhed his Royal Palaces
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:60932:315"/>
(which he had not given away) than any King of <hi>England</hi> before;
and the Parliament about ſix Years before his Death, had given
him 600000 <hi>l.</hi> for building thirty new Men of War, to make his
Fleet more formidable than that of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or <hi>French</hi> King,
and the Nation in Peace unleſs among our ſelves; ſo that it might
have been reaſonably expected a much leſs Revenue than what
King <hi>Charles</hi> had, added to that of the Duke's, might have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
the ordinary Expence of the Crown, if no extraordinary
ſhould happen.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all this, the King upon the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> told
the Members (ſuch as they were) the ſame things he told his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Council, that he might not ſeem to have ſaid it by chance; and
in return thereof, he expected they ſhould ſettle his Revenue
<hi>(becauſe he had taken it without them)</hi> during his Life, as it was
in the time of his Brother, for the Well-being of the Government,
which he muſt not ſuffer to be <hi>precarious,</hi> which I believe was
the firſt time any King of <hi>England</hi> ſo careſſed a Parliament; but
theſe (if they were worthy to be called a Parliament) being
made to his Hand, the King might do and ſay to them what he
pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Before the Kings of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Race came to bear rule over us,
the Methods of Parliaments were to repreſent the Grievances of
the Nation; and upon Redreſs of them the Parliament gave the
King a Gratuity, which before the <hi>35th</hi> of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> did
never exceed one Subſidy, and two Tenths of Fifteenths; and the
King in return, granted an Act of Pardon to his Subjects: Thus a
mutual Correſpondence was entertained between the King and
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But when King <hi>James</hi> the firſt came to the Crown, the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
the Grievances of the Nation, by his diſorderly Reign,
was Language intolerable to him, ſo that of four Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
(which were all he had in his Reign) in the laſt he boaſted, <hi>He
had broke the Neck of three of them;</hi> and his Son broke the neck of
the four firſt Parliaments of his Reign: yet ſuch was the Temper
of thoſe Times, that to humour th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe Princes, the Parliament of
18 <hi>Jac.</hi> I. and the <hi>1ſt Car.</hi> I. altered the Methods of Parliament,
and that of the <hi>18th</hi> gave King <hi>James</hi> two entire Subſidies; and
that of the <hi>1ſt Car.</hi> I. gave King <hi>Charles</hi> two entire Subſidies
before Grievances were redreſſed. King <hi>James</hi> I. in return of
their kindneſs, not only brake the Neck of the Parliament, but
committed many of the worthieſt Members cloſe Priſoners to the
Tower, for pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ming to debate them: King <hi>Charles</hi> did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any Members of this Parliament (tho he did in his <hi>3d</hi> and <hi>4th</hi>
Parliament) but brake the Neck of the Parliament rather than they
ſhould enquire into the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Actions, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezelling
the Monies given by the Parliament for the Support of
the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="617" facs="tcp:60932:315"/>
Heretofore Grievances were in the Nation, whereas at the
Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. the whole Nation was in a moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and dangerous State, which the Parliament of King <hi>James</hi>
(if it be worthy to be ſo called) took ſo little notice of, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of repreſenting the State of the Nation to King <hi>James,</hi> they
without redreſſing any, gave him a Revenue, to enable him to
ruin Church and State, upon the Foundation which his Brother
had laid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> 1ſt <hi>Act was to ſettle the Cuſtoms and temporary Exciſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the King as it was ſettled before upon his Brother;</hi> but the King
had little reaſon to thank them for that, for he took both before they
gave them, and called them by that Title, <hi>His Revenue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>3d</hi> Act was an Impoſition upon Wines and Vinegars, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
between the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1685, until the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1693,
towards a Supply for Repairs of the Navy, and providing Stores
for the Navy and Ordnance, and other his Majeſty's weighty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Occaſions: <hi>They ſhall ſoon find the weight and importance of
his Majeſty's Occaſions.</hi> But this was not the only Reaſon; the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
which were 800000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> as granted to his Brother,
and a greater Revenue than any King of <hi>England</hi> (except the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Houſes, granted to <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII.) had before, would have done
this: They add their thankful Acknowledgment of his Majeſty's
favourable and tender regard of his Commons; <hi>They had but little
experience of it yet, and ſhall find leſs afterward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>4th</hi> Act grants in Impoſition upon all Tobaccos and Sugars,
from the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1685, to the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1693, for the
Repairs of the Navy, and providing Stores for the Navy and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dnance,
and the payment of Debts due to his late Majeſty's Servants
and Family, and other the King's weighty and important Affairs:
But this Act being repreſented to be dangerous to the Trade of
our Plantations, ſome of the Members ſaid for the King, if it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
ſo, the King promiſed not to collect them, ſo the Act paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
<hi>But the Plantations being ſore oppreſſed by this Act, claimed the
Benefit of the King's Promiſe, but were anſwered, It was Inſolence in
any Subject to challenge the King of his Promiſe, which was all the
Benefit they reaped by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>5th</hi> Act granted the King an Impoſition on all <hi>French</hi> Linens,
and all <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Linen, and ſeveral other Manufactures of <hi>India,</hi>
and <hi>French</hi> wrought Silks and Stuffs, and all Brandies imported
from the firſt Day of <hi>July</hi> 1685, to the firſt day of <hi>July</hi> 1690.
The reaſon of this Act was, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Rebellion,
and the Acknowledgment of his Majeſty's favourable and tender
regard of his Commons.</p>
               <p>And that there might be a nearer Conjunction between the King
and his dear Brother of <hi>France,</hi> for carrying on their great and
important Affairs, the Parliament repealed the Prohibition of
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:60932:316"/>
                  <hi>French</hi> Wine, Vinegar, Brandy, Linen, Cloth, Silks, Malt, Paper,
or any Manufactures made or mixed with Silk, Thread, Wool,
Hair, Gold or Silver, or Leather, being of the Growth and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture
of <hi>France,</hi> by the <hi>29th</hi> and <hi>30th</hi> of King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Second.</p>
               <p>The <hi>9th</hi> Act enables the King to make Grants, Leaſes and Copies
of Offices, Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments of the Dutchy
of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> or annexed to the ſame; and if this were not enough,
it confirms the Grants already made: ſo that all the ſacred Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Crown, which was not ſquandred away by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this King is intituled to do by Law.</p>
               <p>Yet after all this, that this good King might be at no unneceſſary
Charges, the <hi>10th</hi> Act makes proviſion for neceſſary Carriages for
him in his Royal Progreſs and Removal, how grievous ſoever to the
Subject.</p>
               <p>The <hi>11th</hi> Act provides Carriages by Land and Water, for the
uſe of his Majeſty's Navy and Ordnance.</p>
               <p>And after all this, the <hi>12th</hi> Act grants the King five Shillings
<hi>per</hi> Tun extraordinary upon every Voyage, which any Foreign
Ship ſhall make from Port to Port in <hi>England,</hi> and twelve pence
<hi>per</hi> Tun for every Voyage which a Foreign built Ship, not free,
ſhall make.</p>
               <p>I have heard this Revenue with the Hereditary Exciſe, and the
other Revenues of the Crown, computed at 2400000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi>
to which Revenue if you add 150000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> which the King
had when he was Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the whole will amount to two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
five hundred and fifty thouſand Pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> which was
threefold more than ever any King of <hi>England</hi> (except <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII.)
had before this King's Brother.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Quorſum haec?</hi> for except the Tumult which the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth</hi> raiſed, the Nation was at Peace abroad; ſo that by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King this Revenue, one of theſe two Conſequences would
neceſſarily follow: either the King might maintain an Army of
forty thouſand Men, to ride the Nation as he pleaſed; or if he
would contract his Expence to 700000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> which, I ſay,
was a greater Revenue than ever King of <hi>England</hi> (except <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII.)
had before his Brother, he might in leſs than ſeven years time,
hoard up more Money in his Exchequer (allowing ten Millions to
be in <hi>England)</hi> than was in the Nation; and thereby render the
Nation in as bad a State as <hi>Egypt</hi> was in the Reign of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in
the ſeven Years Famine, when the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were forced to ſell the
King their Land to buy them Bread. Now let's ſee to whom this
Revenue was given, and who gave it.</p>
               <p>This King was a <hi>profeſt Jeſuited Papiſt,</hi> whoſe Principles are,
That not only the Givers of this Revenue, but the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(except the Popiſh Faction) are Schiſmaticks, Sacrilegious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:60932:316"/>
and Hereticks, with whom no Faith is to be kept; and could
any Man believe this profuſe Donative which theſe Men gave, who
called themſelves a Parliament, could change the King's Nature,
and the Principles of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> which forſooth muſt be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
ſo that the King ſhould neglect theſe, and imploy this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
for the benefit of Schiſmaticks, Hereticks and Sacrilegious
Perſons?</p>
               <p>And if in all free Aſſemblies, a Violence or Contempt upon any
one, who hath a Right of Suffrage, invalidates all the Acts of that
Aſſembly; what then ſhall be deemed of this Houſe of Commons,
where ſuch Violences were offered in the Election of the Knights
of Shires, and where ſo many Corporations were either over-aw'd
to ſurrender their Charters, or had perfidiouſly againſt their Oaths
given them up to take new ones, as the King pleaſed? And if the
firſt Act of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. repealed all the Acts of the 21 <hi>Rich.</hi> II. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they intrenched upon the fundamental Rights of the Nation,
I'm ſure there is more Reaſon for the Parliament to repeal the Acts
of this pretended Parliament, where ſo many Violences and Frauds
were done before their Aſſembly, which we do not read were
done before the Parliament of 21 <hi>Rich.</hi> II. met.</p>
               <p>And as this grave Aſſembly heaped ſuch a Revenue upon the
King without redreſs of one Grievance, ſo they took no care to
ſecure the Nation by a general <hi>Act of Grace or Pardon</hi> for time
paſt, but left all to the King's good Nature, who had promiſed to
imitate his good and gracious Brother, but eſpecially in his great
Clemency and Tenderneſs to his People. And now the Parliament
had done the King's work, they had done their own too; and for
the time to come, he will do what he pleaſeth without them: yet
at preſent, he only prorogued them till <hi>November</hi> following,
when they ſhall hear more of his Mind. And now 'tis time to ſee
what the King acted between.</p>
               <p>The firſt Act of Gratitude which the King teſtified to the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his good and gracious Brother, was his obſcure and mean
Burial of him, as you have heard before.</p>
               <p>And after the King had defeated the Tumult raiſed by the Duke
of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> his next Act of Gratitude to his kind Brother, was
to ſign a Warrant of Execution for the Duke (his Brother's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Son) without any Trial or Proceſs of Law againſt him: But
his Grandfather <hi>James</hi> the Firſt had either done the like, or at
leaſt not unlike it, when he came to <hi>Newark</hi> upon <hi>Trent,</hi> in his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to <hi>London,</hi> at his firſt coming to the Crown; one was ſaid to
cut a Purſe, whereupon the King without more ado ſigned a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for his Execution to the Sheriff, and the poor Fellow was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
accordingly.</p>
               <p>The Duke ſuffered upon the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> but the Iſſue of Blood
did not ſtanch with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for towards the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> a
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:60932:317"/>
Special Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> was granted to Sir <hi>George
Jefferies,</hi> and four other Judges, to try the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s
Adherents in the <hi>Weſt:</hi> But as the Duke ſuffered without any Trial,
and ſo was unjuſtly put to Death, ſo I believe, this Commiſſion
was initiated by ſuch a Trial as can ſcarce be parallel'd by any
other; and this was the Caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alicia Liſle,</hi> a Woman of extream Age, was Wife of <hi>Liſle,</hi>
(one of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's Judges, and who was Preſident of
the High Court of Juſtice, as 'twas then called, in the Trials of
Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Capel;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in the Trial of Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hewet,</hi> &amp;c.) and had
entertained after the Defeat of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> one <hi>Hicks</hi>
(a <hi>Non-Conformiſt</hi> Miniſter) who was with the Duke, not in any
Proclamation that he was ſo; and one <hi>Richard Nelthorp</hi> (a Stranger
to Mrs. <hi>Liſle)</hi> who was in the Proclamation, and Out-lawed of
High Treaſon; for which ſhe was tried at <hi>Wincheſter</hi> for High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
for comforting and aſſiſting Rebels.</p>
               <p>It appears by the publick Prints, the Jury were ſo unſatisfied
by the Evidence, <hi>(Hicks</hi> not being in any Proclamation, and <hi>Nel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi>
unknown to Mrs. <hi>Liſle)</hi> that they thrice brought her in <hi>Not
Guilty;</hi> at laſt, upon <hi>Jefferies</hi> Threats, they brought her in Guilty
of <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> and ſo had Sentence paſſed upon her accordingly,
which in Women is to be burnt, but the Execution was by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading
of her; ſo that whether the Sentence was juſt or not, the
Execution was unjuſt; for though the King may pardon or miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the Puniſhment of any Crime againſt him, as to pardon Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or to mitigate the Execution to beheading, which is part of
the Sentence, yet he cannot alter the Puniſhment into any other
than the Law preſcribes: but the Convention after King <hi>William</hi>
came in, were ſo diſſatisfied in her Caſe, that though they could
not reſtore her to Life, yet they reverſt the Judgment for her
Death.</p>
               <p>From this uncertain Juſtice, <hi>Jefferies</hi> and his Brethren make
haſte to proceed in their Commiſſion <hi>Summo Jure,</hi> and from <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi>
by <hi>Salisbury,</hi> upon the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>September</hi> (a day fam'd for
<hi>Oliver</hi>'s Victory over the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> over King <hi>Charles</hi> the II.
at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and for his Death) arrives at <hi>Dorcheſter;</hi> and becauſe
time was precious, the next day <hi>Jefferies</hi> contrives this Stratagem
to ſhorten his Work.</p>
               <p>Thirty Perſons being found by the Grand Inqueſt to have
aſſiſted the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> when they came upon their
Trials, and before they had pleaded, <hi>Jefferies</hi> told them, that
whoſoever pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> and was found ſo, ſhould have
little time to live, and if any expected Favour, he muſt plead
<hi>Guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="621" facs="tcp:60932:317"/>
But the Priſoners truſted little to what <hi>Jefferies</hi> ſaid, and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Not Guilty,</hi> yet 29 were found <hi>Guilty,</hi> and immediately Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was paſſed upon them, and a Warrant of Execution ſigned
upon <hi>Monday</hi> following; after which a couple of Officers were
ſent to the Goal, to take the Names of all the Priſoners, who told
the Priſoners, if they confeſt, they might expect Mercy, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
none was to be hoped for: theſe wretched Men thus wheedled,
pleaded <hi>Guilty,</hi> and ſo at one Sentence <hi>Jefferies</hi> condemned 292,
whereof 80 were executed.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Dorcheſter Jefferies</hi> proceeded to <hi>Exeter,</hi> and uſed the
ſame Stratagem as at <hi>Dorcheſter:</hi> for one Mr. <hi>Fower Acres</hi> being
arraigned, and pleading <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> yet being found ſo, had imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
Sentence paſſed upon him, and Execution awarded upon it;
whereupon 243 pleaded <hi>Guilty,</hi> and by one Sentence had Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
paſſed upon them.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Exeter Jefferies</hi> marched to <hi>Taunton,</hi> where ſome few
pleaded <hi>Not Guilty;</hi> but being found, had immediately Sentence
and Execution awarded; the reſt terrified, pleaded <hi>Guilty,</hi> and had
Sentence paſſed upon them: and thence <hi>Jefferies</hi> marched to <hi>Wells,</hi>
where he finiſhed his bloody Aſſize, where and at <hi>Taunton</hi> he
condemned above 509, whereof 239 were executed, and had
their Heads and Quarters ſet up in the principal Places, and High
Roads of <hi>Somerſet</hi> and <hi>Dorſetſhires,</hi> to the terror of Paſſengers,
and annoyance of thoſe Parts. In theſe Executions I find one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Story; it's printed in a Treatiſe, called <hi>The New Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rology,</hi>
fol. 478.</p>
               <p>Colonel <hi>Holmes,</hi> and 11 more of thoſe condemned at <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi>
were carried from <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> to <hi>Lime</hi> towards their Execution, by
ſix in a Coach, and ſix in a Cart; and at <hi>Lime</hi> they were put in
a Sledg prepared to carry them to be executed; but the Horſes
could not be driven to go, but turned backward: whereupon the
Coach-horſes were taken from the Coach, and put to draw the
Sledg, but then the Sledg broke; ſo the poor Men were forced
to go on their Feet to their Execution.</p>
               <p>I will not diſpute the Juſtice of theſe Executions; but I ſay,
Juſtice ought to look forward, <hi>viz.</hi> to terrify others from commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
like Crimes, never backward to take Pleaſure in puniſhing;
and a black Brand is ſet upon the Reigns of thoſe Princes which
ſhed much Blood: nor do we read in any Story, ſuch a Sea of
Blood flowed from Juſtice as did in leſs than eight Months after
this King began his Reign: and that which rendred it more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
was the King's Profeſſion to his Privy Council, and after
to the Parliament, That he would imitate his good and gracious
Brother, but above all, in his great Clemency and Tenderneſs to
his People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="622" facs="tcp:60932:318"/>
But if Juſtice look'd forward in <hi>Jeffries</hi>'s Executions, it did not
in <hi>Kirk</hi>'s, (who was one of King <hi>James</hi>'s Major-Generals in the
Expedition againſt the Duke of <hi>Monmouth)</hi> who when after the
Duke's Defeat he came to <hi>Taunton,</hi> cauſed 90 wounded Men, who
had been taken Priſoners, not permitting their Wives or Children
to ſpeak with them, to be hang'd, with Pipes playing, Drums
beating, and Trumpets ſounding; and after, their Bowels to be
burnt, their Quarters to be boiled in Pitch, and hang'd in ſeveral
parts of the Town: and I have heard, that when afterwards <hi>Kirk</hi>
was charged with this Inhumanity, he excuſed it, that he could
do no leſs, it being but part of the Inſtructions he had from the
Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>F</hi>—, General in this famous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</p>
               <p>As yet no Pardon could be hoped for to any one, but by thoſe
which could purchaſe it by the Ruin of their Eſtates; and thoſe
which could not purchaſe one, were ſold for Slaves to the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>When Juſtice could take no further place, then out comes a
Pardon, but ſo ridiculouſly cruel, as will ſcarcely be believed;
for not only thoſe who eſcaped were excepted, but a Company
of Girls, ſome of 8 or 9 Years old, who had made ſome Colours,
and preſented them to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> while he was at
<hi>Taunton,</hi> theſe were excepted by Name; and no Pardon could
be purchaſed for this Treaſon, till the Girls Parents had paid
more for it than would have provided a Marriage Portion when
they ſhould come of Age.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe the King did imitate his good and gracious Brother
in his great Clemency and Tenderneſs to his People, and that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
only looked forward in theſe Executions; yet we will give
Inſtances wherein this King did not imitate his good and gracious
Brother in his great Clemency and Tenderneſs to his People.</p>
               <p>Alderman <hi>Corniſh,</hi> tho he had committed two horrible Crimes
in the Reign of King <hi>Charles;</hi> one, in preſuming to examine
<hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> while he was a Priſoner in <hi>Newgate,</hi> before he was
hurried from thence to the <hi>Tower,</hi> to prevent his further Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
the other, that he teſtified at <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Trial, that
King <hi>Charles</hi> told Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> that the King did countenance
<hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> in his Deſign, and had given him Money; yet King
<hi>Charles</hi> was ſo good and gracious, as not to take away Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi>'s
Life.</p>
               <p>But the offended Ghoſts of <hi>Coleman, Ireland, Harcourt,</hi> &amp;c. were
no ways appeaſed by the Blood which flowed from the Stripes of
<hi>Oates</hi>'s Sentence; nothing leſs than a Sacrifice of humane Blood
muſt be offered to them, and this to be performed by affixing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Juſtice to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="623" facs="tcp:60932:318"/>
Upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> the—of <hi>October,</hi> Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> having no dread
of any Accuſation upon him for any Crime, but freely following
his Profeſſion, was clapt up cloſe Priſoner in <hi>Newgate,</hi> without
uſe of Pen, Ink, or Paper, till <hi>Saturday</hi> Noon, when he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of an Indictment of High Treaſon againſt him on <hi>Monday</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
and could get no Friend to come to him till 8 a clock at
Night: Next Day Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi>'s Children petitioned the King to
have his Trial put off, which was referred to the Judges (who
you may be aſſured had their Inſtructions) who denied it, tho
he knew not whether his Trial were for Treaſon againſt this or
the late King, and his moſt material Witneſs was above 140
Miles off, and was alſo denied a Copy of the Pannel of his Jury.</p>
               <p>The Charge of High Treaſon againſt him was, That in the Year
1682, he had promiſed to be aſſiſting to <hi>James</hi> late Duke of
<hi>Monmouth, William Ruſſel</hi> Eſquire, and Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> in
their Treaſons againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> II.</p>
               <p>The only Witneſs to prove this was Colonel <hi>Rumſey;</hi> who ſwore,
That about the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> or beginning of <hi>November,</hi> at
Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi>'s Houſe, <hi>Ferguſon</hi> told Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> that he had read a
Paper to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> which they deſired ſhould be read to Mr. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh;</hi>
that Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> held the Candle while it was reading, and
afterward they asked him how he liked it, who ſaid he liked it
very well. He remembred two Points in it very well; one was for
<hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> the other was, <hi>That all who would aſſiſt in that
Inſurrection who had had Kings Lands, or Church Lands, ſhould have
them reſtored to them. Rumſey</hi> did not hear all the Paper, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
only theſe two Points; it was a Declaration on a Riſing,
and when the Riſing was to have been, it was to have been diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
abroad: there was a Riſing intended at that time, and Mr. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
ſaid, <hi>He liked the Declaration, and what poor Interest he had he
would join in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rumſey</hi> had ſworn at my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Trial, that Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi>
was not at the Reading or the Declaration by <hi>Ferguſon;</hi> and being
tax'd for it in this, ſaid it was out of Compaſſion to the Priſoner;
and Mr. <hi>Sheppard,</hi> who was <hi>ſubpoena'd</hi> for the King, teſtified
Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> was not there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard Goodenough</hi> was the other Witneſs, which was about
Words foreign to <hi>Rumſey</hi>'s Teſtimony, about ſeizing the <hi>Tower,</hi>
and a Riſing in the City; which if what <hi>Goodenough</hi> ſaid had been
true, yet Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> could not have been found Guilty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
for tho by the firſt Act of Parliament after the Convention
of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. Words were made Treaſon againſt the King
during his Life, yet were they to be proſecuted within ſix Months,
and the Perſon to be indicted in three Months after; whereas theſe
Words were pretended to be ſpoken in <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term in 1683,
which was two Years and a half before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="624" facs="tcp:60932:319"/>
Add hereto, the Words were imperfectly ſaid by <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and
might be applicable to a pretended Riot, wherein Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> was
concerned; and that <hi>Goodenough</hi> was upon ill Terms with Mr. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi>
becauſe he would not truſt <hi>Goodenough</hi> to be his Under-Sheriff.
You may read the Trial at large, with Mr. <hi>Hawles</hi> his
fine and learned Remarks upon it; and how rudely Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> and
his Witneſſes were uſed at his Trial, and how notwithſtanding his
Quality, after Conviction he was tied, as if he had been a boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and dangerous Rogue, and that by Order, and executed with
the utmoſt Rigour of the Law for this far-fetch'd and ill-proved
Treaſon. But theſe <hi>Tories</hi> ſhall ſoon ſee they labour for others,
not for themſelves; and theſe whom they now perſecute ſhall
have the Aſcendant over them. And I obſerved this of Sir <hi>Thomas
Jones,</hi> who was Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> and moſt active
in this Trial, that he was one of the firſt, if not the firſt, who was
turned out of his Place for giving his Opinion, the King could not
diſpenſe with the <hi>Test</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Deſign thus deep ſtained in humane Blood, firſt budded in
<hi>Ireland;</hi> but whether it was in Affirmance of the King's Promiſe
to his Privy Council, and after repeated by him in Parliament,
that he would make it his Endeavour to preſerve the Church and
State of <hi>England</hi> as by Law eſtabliſhed, let any Man who reads the
following Story judg.</p>
               <p>The Book ſtiled the <hi>State of the Proteſtants in</hi> Ireland, ſaid to
be written by Biſhop <hi>King,</hi> fol. 58. ſays, That King <hi>James</hi> was no
ſooner ſettled in his Throne, but he began to turn out ſome Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
who had been moſt zealous for his Service, and had beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
of him, meerly becauſe they had been counted firm to the
Proteſtant Religion and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt, ſuch as my Lord
<hi>Shannon,</hi> Captain <hi>Robert Fitz-Gerald,</hi> Captain <hi>Richard Coote,</hi> Sir
<hi>Oliver St. George;</hi> and put in their places, <hi>Kerney</hi> (one of the
Ruſſians deſigned to murder <hi>Charles</hi> II.) <hi>Anderſon</hi> (a mean Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low)
<hi>Sheldon</hi> (a profeſt Papiſt) and one <hi>Graham:</hi> and <hi>fol.</hi> 59.
ſaith, the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> was ſent for abruptly, and diveſted of
the Government; and immediately the modelling of the Army was
put into the Hands of Colonel <hi>Richard Talbot,</hi> a Man of all others
moſt hated by the Proteſtants, and who had been named by Mr.
<hi>Oates,</hi> in his Narrative, for this very Employment; ſo that many
who believed nothing of the Plot before, gave Credit to it now,
and ſaid, <hi>That if</hi> Oates <hi>were an ill Evidence, he was certainly a
good Prophet.</hi> Now let's ſee the Character the Biſhop gave <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,</hi>
and the manner of his reforming the Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Talbot</hi> knowing how neceſſary it was to have the Army fitted
for his purpoſe, proſecuted it in ſuch manner as might be beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from a Man of ſo inſolent a Temper. He exerciſed at the
ſame time ſo much Barbarity and Falſhood, that if the Army had
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:60932:319"/>
not been the beſt principled with Loyalty and Obedience in the
World, they had mutiny'd, or at leaſt diſpatch'd him. In the
Morning he would take an Officer into his Cloſet, and with all
the Oaths, Curſes, and Damnations, which were never wanting
to him, he would profeſs Friendſhip and Kindneſs to him, and
promiſe him the continuance of his Commiſſion, and in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon
caſhier him with all the Contempt he could heap upon
him; nay, perhaps while he was thus careſſing him, he had actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
given away his Commiſſion: As for the Souldiers and Troop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
his way with them was, to march them from their uſual Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to ſome diſtant place, where he thought they were leaſt
known, where they ſhould be put to the greateſt Hardſhips, and
where he ſtripped them; the Foot of their Clothes, for which
they had paid, and the Troopers of their Horſes, Boots, and Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture,
bought with their own Money; and ſent them to walk
barefooted 100 or 150 Miles to their Homes or Friends, if they
had any: ſometimes he would promiſe them ſomething for their
Horſes, but then they muſt come to <hi>Dublin</hi> for it; if any came
to demand the ſmall Pittance he had promiſed them for their
Horſes, or Arrears of Pay, he contrived it ſo, that they muſt be
obliged to wait till they had ſpent twice ſo much as they expected,
and moſt of them, after all, got nothing: by which means 2 or
300 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen, who had laid out all, or a good part of
their Fortunes, and contracted Debts on Commiſſions, were left
not worth any thing, but were turned out without Reaſon, or any
Conſideration, and 5 or 6000 Souldiers ſent a begging. Yet
this <hi>Talbot,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Tyrrel,</hi> ſo early as in <hi>July</hi> 1685, (in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval
of King <hi>James</hi>'s Parliament) recommends to the King as
the moſt fit Man to be Lord-Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as you may
read in his Letter to the King in Biſhop <hi>King</hi>'s Appendix, <hi>fol.</hi> 295.
So that what-ever the King ſaid, either to his Privy-Council or
Parliament, he was proceeding on his Deſign he had been long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
contriving.</p>
               <p>I do not find the Parliament, at their next Meeting in <hi>November,</hi>
took notice of any of theſe things; but the King, in his Speech
to them at their Meeting, made it (to me it ſeems) plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
he deſigned the ſame in <hi>England</hi> which he was practiſing in
<hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He told them, That the <hi>Militia,</hi> ſo much before depended on,
was not ſufficient for his Occaſions, and that nothing could do but
a good Force of well-diſciplined Troops in conſtant Pay to defend
as from ſuch, as either at home or abroad are diſpoſed to diſturb
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>: That in Truth his Concern for the Peace and Quiet of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
as well as for the Safety of his Government, made him think
a neceſſary to encreaſe the Number as he had done. This he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wed as well to the Honour and Security of the Nation, whoſe
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:60932:320"/>
Reputation was ſo infinitely expoſed to all our Neighbours, by
having been laid open to the late wretched Attempt <hi>(Monmouth</hi>'s)
that it is not to be repaired without keeping ſuch a Body of Men
on foot, that none may ever have the Thoughts again of finding
us ſo miſerably unprovided: That it was for the Support of this
great Charge, which is now more than double what it was, that
he asked their Aſſiſtance, in giving him a Supply anſwerable to
the Expence it brings along with it: That he could not doubt,
but what he had begun, ſo much to the Honour and Defence of
the Government, would be continued by them with all Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Readineſs, which is requiſite for a Work of ſo great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
               <p>Then he goes on, and ſays, Let no Man take Exception that
there are ſome Officers in the Army not qualified according to the
late Teſts for their Employments; theſe Gentlemen (he ſaid) he
muſt tell them, are moſt of them well known to him, and having
formerly ſerved him on ſeveral Occaſions, and always approved
the Loyalty of their Principles by their Practice, he thinks them
now fit to be employed under him; and that he would deal plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with them, that after having had the Benefit of their Services
in ſuch a time of Need and Danger, he will neither expoſe them
to Diſgrace, nor himſelf to the want of them, if there ſhould be
another Rebellion to make them neceſſary to him.</p>
               <p>Then he cajoles them, and tells them he is afraid ſome Men
might be ſo wicked to hope and expect that a Difference might
happen between them and him: but when they conſider what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
had ariſen to him and them, in a few Months, by the
good Underſtanding they have hitherto had, what wonderful Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
it had already produced in the Charge <hi>(Change)</hi> of the whole
Scene of Affairs abroad, ſo much to the Honour of the Nation,
and the Figure it ought to make in the World, and that nothing
can hinder a further Progreſs in this way to all their Satisfactions,
but Jealouſies and Fears among our ſelves; he will not apprehend
that ſuch a Misfortune could befal him and them, as a Diviſion,
or but Coldneſs between them, nor that any thing could ſhake
them in their Steadineſs and Loyalty to him, who (by God's Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing)
would always make them all Returns of Kindneſs, with a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
even to venture his own Life in the Defence and true Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of this Kingdom.</p>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e let us ſee how this King's Speech correſponded with that
to his Privy Council, and that of the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> before, and his
Actions between the Prorogation and Meeting of the Parliament;
and I will ſpeak it in the Perſon of the King.</p>
               <p>At my firſt coming to ſucceed ſo good and gracious, as well as
ſo kind a Brother, I then promiſed to endeavour to follow his
Example, and more eſpecially in his great Clemency and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:60932:320"/>
to his People; his Kindneſs to me I have endeavoured to
ſhew in his ſolemn Burial, and the Execution of his Son, without
any legal Trial or Proceſs: and ſure none of you but muſt needs
take notice how I have endeavoured to imitate him in his great
Tenderneſs and Clemency to his People, not only in the Mercy I
extended to thoſe who aſſiſted in <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Rebellion, but in the
Trials of <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Corniſh,</hi> tho my good and gracious Brother
thought it not fit ſo to do.</p>
               <p>I then told you, as I would never depart from the juſt Rights
and Prerogatives of the Crown, ſo I would never invade any Man's
Property: but this muſt be only underſtood in <hi>England;</hi> for ſince
that I have given Colonel <hi>Richard Talbot</hi> (whom I intend to make
Lord-Lieutenant in <hi>Ireland)</hi> an independent Commiſſion to reform
the Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to take the Troopers Horſes, Piſtols,
Swords and Boots, and the Arms and Clothing of the Foot, which
they had bought and paid for, without paying for them.</p>
               <p>I then told you, I would endeavour to preſerve the Church and
State of <hi>England,</hi> as eſtabliſhed by Law; but now I tell you, that
I have employed ſome Officers in the Army, not qualified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the late Teſts; and will deal plainly with you, I will
neither expoſe them to Diſgrace, nor my ſelf to the want of
them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Militia</hi> is not ſufficient for my Occaſions, nothing but a
good Force of diſciplin'd Troops, in conſtant Pay, will do it; and
to that purpoſe, I think it neceſſary to encreaſe the Number to the
proportion I have done, <hi>viz.</hi> double, for which I ask your Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
in giving me a Supply anſwerable to the Expence it brings
along with it.</p>
               <p>Tho I have disbanded the Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which were as true
<hi>Paſſive-Obedience-Men</hi> as could be got for Love or Money, yet were
they not fit for my Occaſions; and tho I have encreaſed my Army
in <hi>England</hi> to ſuch a Proportion as you now ſee, and officer'd with
ſuch Officers as are not qualified by the late Teſts, yet they are not
fit for my Occaſions, and for which I ask your Aſſiſtance, in giving
me a Supply anſwerable to the Expence it brings along with it:
yet let no Man be ſo wicked, as to hope this may put a Difference
between you and me; but conſider what Advantages have ariſen
to us in a few Months by the good Underſtanding we have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
had, and the wonderful Effects it hath already had. Now let's
ſee what Influence this King's Speech had upon the Members.</p>
               <p>The Lords, hand over head, ordered Thanks to the King for his
good and gracious Speech; but it did not paſs ſo haſtily with the
Commons, but they debated it Paragraph by Paragraph: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the <hi>Militia</hi> had not been ſo forward as the King would have
them, they voted, that they would take into their Conſideration
how to make it more uſeful in time to come, in caſe ſuch dangerous

a Way which tends to the Nations as well as their Deſtructions, they
tell the King ſuch Ways may give Apprehenſions and Jealouſies in
the Hearts of His Majeſty's good and faithful Subjects. Did not
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:60932:321"/>
the Commons in all the four Parliaments in King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>2d</hi>'s
Reign, declare what would be the Conſequences of the Duke of
<hi>York</hi>'s coming to the Crown? and did the Duke's Actions, while
he was Regent in <hi>Scotland,</hi> any ways alleviate thoſe Parliaments
Fears? Could this Parliament (as 'twas called) now they were
got together again, and ſaw Colonel <hi>Talbot</hi> with an independent
Commiſſion from the Lord Lieutenant, ſo barbarouſly disbanding
the Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe guilty only of being Proteſtants,
yet believe the King would admit of no Papiſts in his Army in
<hi>England?</hi> Could they believe that once profeſſing of the King,
who was a <hi>Jeſuited Papiſt,</hi> that he would maintain the Church
and State as by Law eſtabliſhed, would waſh out all the Jeſuit
Principles which had taken ſuch deep root in him, that no Faith is
to be kept with Hereticks, which the King eſteemed theſe, who
had proſtituted him with ſuch a vaſt Revenue, and all the Nation
beſides who were not of his Faction, to be; but that by Fire,
Faggot, and all other ſuch means they were to be rooted out, and
grow no more upon the Face of the Earth?</p>
               <p>The Biſhops retained freſh in memory, during the Reign of
King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> the Indignities the Factions in the late times
had ſhewed to their Perſons and Revenues, ſo that they were not
only oppoſite to the Commons in paſſing the Bills which the
Commons had prepared for uniting the King's Proteſtant Subjects,
when they perceived the Danger the Nation was in by the <hi>Popiſh</hi>
Deſigns; but ſtifly oppoſed the paſſing <hi>The Bill of Excluſion</hi> againſt
the Succeſſion of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and all along King <hi>Charles</hi> his
Reign, countenanced the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves, and their Order moſt ſecure under it; but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Politicks failed them.</p>
               <p>For now the Biſhops perceived a more terrible Storm coming
upon them, by a Faction who never ſhewed Mercy to any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to them whenever it came in their Power; and the Doctrine
of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> had made a plain and eaſy Paſſage for the <hi>Popiſh</hi>
Faction to take Poſſeſſion of this Power: The Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>
therefore, after the Lords had voted an Addreſs of Thanks to the
King's Speech, moved in the name of himſelf and all his Brethren,
that the Houſe would debate the King's Speech, which, as it was
extraordinary and unuſual in the Houſe, ſo was it not leſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
to the King and Court, who now dreaded the Lords would
concur with the Commons in their Addreſs; to prevent which,
the King firſt prorogued, and then diſſolved the Parliament, and
never called another in all his Reign: And thus the King made
good to the Parliament, in his Speech to them the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>May,
That the beſt Way to engage him to meet them often was, to uſe him well,
and did expect that they would comply with him in what he deſired,
and that they would do it ſpeedily, that it might be a ſhort Seſſions,
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:60932:322"/>
and that he and the Parliament might meet again to all their Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions:</hi>
and for the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> the King ſhall remember
his Motion in due time, when he ſhall plead no Privilege of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>The King having ſo ill performed his Promiſe to the Parliament,
of often meeting of them, where he might hear of it again, which
by no means he would endure; after he had diſſolved them, had
a fair Field without any Rub to do what he pleaſed; and to petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, or repreſent the Grievances of the Nation out of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
ſhall be a great Crime, next to High Treaſon: And now
'tis time to obſerve the Steps the King proceeded by, to maintain
the Church and State of <hi>England,</hi> as by Law eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>His Brother had laid the Foundation of making a Parliament
<hi>felo de ſe,</hi> by hectoring and making Bargains with Corporations to
ſurrender their Charters, and taking new ones from him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he reſerved a Power, that if they did not ſend ſuch Members
as pleaſed him, he would reſume the Charters he granted them:
and herein he made a great Progreſs, till his Keeper and Attorney
General refuſed to grant Patents to ſuch poor Corporations as could
not pay their Fees, ſo as a new Keeper or Chancellor, and Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-General
muſt be had, who would grant Patents <hi>gratis,</hi> or a
Stop would be made in the Progreſs of ſo noble a Deſign.</p>
               <p>In a lucky Hour my Lord Keeper <hi>N</hi>—died at <hi>Aſtrop-Wells,</hi>
I think when <hi>Jeffries</hi> was in his March to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of my Lord <hi>Jeffries</hi>'s Clemency that he ſhewed, had the Seals
given him, with the Title of Lord Chancellour; but the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
was not ſo lucky, but lived to be turned out, and another
put in his Place, which would perform his Office more charitably
to theſe indigent Corporations, which could not pay their Fees in
taking new Patents, after they had perfidiouſly betrayed their old.</p>
               <p>But this was but one Step towards this Holy Work; the King, to
make a thorow Reformation, will make the Judges in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Hall</hi>
to murder the Common Law, as well as the King and
his Brother deſigned to murder the Parliament by it ſelf; and to
this end, the King, before he would make any Judges, would
make a Bargain with them, that they ſhould declare the King's
Power of diſpenſing with the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſts</hi> made againſt
Recuſants, out of Parliament.</p>
               <p>However herein the King ſtumbled at the Threſhold; for it's
ſaid he began with Sir <hi>Thomas Jones,</hi> who had merited ſo much
in Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> his Trial, and in the <hi>Weſt;</hi> yet Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> bogled at
this, and told the King, <hi>He could not do it:</hi> to which the K. anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>He would have Twelve Judges of his Opinion;</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>
replied, <hi>He might have Twelve Judges of his Opinion, but would
ſcarce find Twelve Lawyers of his Opinion.</hi> The Truth of this I have
only from Fame; but I'm ſure the King's Practice in reforming
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:60932:322"/>
the Judges, whereof all (except my Lord Chief Baron <hi>Atkins,</hi> and
Juſtice <hi>Powel)</hi> were ſuch a Pack as never before ſat in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi>
gave credit to it.</p>
               <p>But if the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Thorp,</hi> for taking a Bribe of 100 <hi>l.</hi>
was adjudged to be hanged, and all his Lands and Goods forfeited,
in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> becauſe thereby as much as in him
lay, he had broken the King's Oath made unto the People, which
the King had intruſted him withal; and if Juſtice <hi>Treſilian</hi> was
hanged, drawn and quartered, for giving his Judgment that the
King might act contrary to one Act of Parliament; and if <hi>Blake,</hi>
the King's Counſel, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>sk,</hi> the Under-Sheriff of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and
five more of Quality, were hanged in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th</hi>
for but aſſiſting in <hi>Treſilian</hi>'s Judgment; What then did theſe
Judges deſerve, which made Bargains with the King before-hand,
to break the King's Oath he had made to the People, and
entituled the King to a Power to ſubvert the Laws, and gave Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before-hand to act contrary to them? <hi>Andrew Horn</hi> in his
<hi>Mirror of Juſtice</hi> tells us, That King <hi>Alfred</hi> (the Mirror of Kings)
hanged <hi>Darling, Segnor, Cadwine, Cole,</hi> and 40 Judges more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they judged in particular Cauſes contrary to Law: But ſure
this was not more to <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Honour, than it was to the Diſhonour
of King <hi>James,</hi> to make Bargains before-hand with Judges, to
give Judgment contrary to the Laws themſelves; and unleſs they
would break the King's Oath to his People, they ſhould not be his
Judges.</p>
               <p>The Laws and Conſtitutions of this Nation, as has been already
noted, make it a Kingdom, whereof the King is Head, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Body; ſo that if you take away the Laws and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Kingdom, there is neither King nor Kingdom. Did
not the King then deſcend from his Majeſty, in rending himſelf
from his Kingdom, by breaking Laws, whereby he ceaſes to be a
King, and the Nation to be a Kingdom? And what was it for that
the King would not be content with the Soveraignty he had over
the Nation, wherein his Majeſty conſiſted, but would ſtrain it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Tyranny over the Nation? It was to introduce a foreign ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded
Dominion of the Pope, denied by our Saviour, and aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Devil; whereby how abſolute ſoever the King would be
over his Subjects, yet himſelf and Kingdom muſt be at the Pope's
Diſpoſal, to be depoſed and deſtroyed, as the Pope pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Biſhop <hi>King</hi> in the State of the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland, fol.</hi> 18.
gives this Account of one <hi>Moore</hi> a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt, who preached
before the King at <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s-<hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> in the Beginning of
the Year 1690, where he told him to his Face, that he did not do
Juſtice to the Church and Churchmen; and amongſt other things
ſaid, <hi>That Kings ought to conſult Churchmen in Temporal Affairs, the
Clergy having a Temporal, as well as Spiritual Right in the Kingdom;
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:60932:323"/>
but Kings had nothing to do in the Management of Spiritual Affairs,
but were to obey the Orders of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thinking Men could not conceive this diſpenſing with the Penal
Laws and Teſts againſt Diſſenters, was any ways intended in favour
of the Proteſtants; for notwithſtanding the Slaughter <hi>Jeffries</hi> had
made of them in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> the reſt all over <hi>England</hi> were impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and forced to give Security for their good Behaviour. Nay,
my Lord D. of <hi>Albermarle,</hi> who had done the K. ſo ſignal Service, in
keeping the <hi>Devonſhire</hi> Men from joining with the D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi>
muſt be ſent out of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Jamaica;</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi>
and others, who had been ſo active in ſuppreſſing <hi>Monmouth,</hi> were
ſcarce thanked, and but coldly entertained at Court.</p>
               <p>If things were acted with this (indeed bare-fac'd) diſſimulation
in <hi>England,</hi> they were not leſs in <hi>Ireland;</hi> for the King having
revoked the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> from his Lieutenancy, and given
<hi>Talbot</hi> an independent Commiſſion, to make ſuch a reform of the
Army there, as is aforeſaid, made my Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi> Deputy-Lieutenant,
and Sir <hi>Charles Porter</hi> Chancellour, who arrived
there the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>January 1685-86,</hi> with a Charge to declare that
the King would preſerve the Acts of Settlement and Explanation
inviolable, and to aſſure all his Subjects, he would preſerve theſe
Acts as the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of <hi>Ireland:</hi> but this Declaration com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with <hi>Talbot</hi>'s reforming the Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſeemed as
ſtrange, as that the King's diſpenſing with the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and
<hi>Teſts,</hi> was in favour of the Proteſtant Diſſenters in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In</hi> Scotland <hi>the King had ſo ſettled Affairs there, when he was
Commiſſioner, that after the cutting off the Earl of</hi> Argyle, <hi>he did
not doubt to carry on his Deſigns more bare-fac'd there than in</hi>
England <hi>or</hi> Ireland; <hi>and therefore tho he did not call a Parliament
till</hi> April 1686, <hi>yet in his Letter to them of the</hi> 12th <hi>he takes
no Notice of the</hi> Proteſtant Diſſenters, <hi>but recommends to them his
innocent</hi> Roman <hi>Catholick Subjects,</hi> Who had with their Lives and
Fortunes been always aſſiſtant to the Crown in the worſt of Rebellions
and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations, tho they lay under Diſcouragements hardly to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
Theſe he heartily recommended to their Care, to the end, that
as they have given good Experience of their true Loyalty, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Behaviour, ſo by their Aſſiſtance they may have the Protection of
his Laws, and that Security under his Government, which others of
his Subjects had; not ſuffering them to lie under Obligations which
their Religion cannot admit of: by doing whereof they will give a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of the Duty and Affection they had to him, and do him moſt
acceptable Service. This Love he expected they would ſhew to their
Brethren, as they ſaw he was an indulgent Father to them all.</p>
               <p>The King having ſettled his Prerogative in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> by
diſpenſing with the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſts,</hi> in the Beginning of the
Year 1686 granted a Commiſſion of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Affairs;</hi> but
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:60932:323"/>
it was not opened to act till the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following: why it
lay ſo long dormant I do not find, but only gueſs, that the King
might the better ſettle his <hi>Diſpenſing Power</hi> in the Country, by
ſuch Judges as he had made, as well as in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall;</hi> and
that he might be more at leiſure to carry on the Deſign for ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
of Charters, (wherein one <hi>Robert Brent,</hi> a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi>
was a prime Agent) and great Care was taken, that the beggarly
Corporations might ſurrender their Charters, and take new ones,
without paying Fees: and if any ſhould be ſo honeſt, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
upon their Oaths and Truſt repoſed in them, for Preſervation
of their Charters, to be proſecuted as riotous and ſeditious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
But in regard the Commiſſion of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Affairs</hi> was
not printed that I can find, nor is in the <hi>State Tracts,</hi> I thought
fit to inſert it here, as I had it in Manuſcript from a learned Hand.</p>

               <p>Here I make theſe Remarks upon this Commiſſion: Firſt, That
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who was firſt named in it, refuſed
to act in it; ſo the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> was put in, tho not in the
firſt place. Secondly, How unwarily it was drawn; for though I
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:60932:326"/>
believe every one underſtands the Deſign of this Commiſſion was
to introduce a <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy, which aſſumes a Power over the
<hi>temporal</hi> in order to the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Good; yet here this Commiſſion
grants the <hi>temporal Power, (viz.</hi> the Chancellor, and any other
two, <hi>viz.</hi> my Lord Treaſurer, Preſident, or Chief Juſtice) a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Excommunication, which is a pure <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Act. But whilſt
this Commiſſion was thus in <hi>Embrio,</hi> 'tis fit to obſerve what was
done before its coming into Act.</p>
               <p>You have heard how ſeverely <hi>Oates</hi> was treated for diſcovering
the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot, <hi>Thomas Dangerfield</hi>'s turn comes now to be as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
treated, but with a worſe Fate, for diſcovering the <hi>Meal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tub</hi>
Plot, which was to have thrown the <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> upon the
<hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dangerfield</hi> in his Depoſitions before the Parliament had reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that he was imployed by the <hi>Popiſh Party</hi> (chiefly by the Lords
in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and Counteſs of <hi>Powis)</hi> to kill the King, and was
encouraged, and promiſed Impunity and Reward, and part of it
given him by the Duke of <hi>York</hi> for that end: Upon this he was
tried in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> in <hi>Trinity,</hi> I think, or <hi>Eaſter-Term,</hi> in
1686, upon a <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> and as Juries went, was found
Guilty, and had the ſame Sentence of Whipping which <hi>Oates</hi> had,
and in his return from his Whipping from <hi>Tyburn</hi> towards <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi>
was run into the Eye with a Tuck at the end of a Cane,
by one <hi>Robert Francis</hi> (a fierce Papiſt) of which, with the Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his Whipping, he ſoon after died; but his Body was ſo ſwoln
and martyr'd with his Whipping, that 'twas a queſtion whether he
died of the Whipping, or Wound in his Eye. You may read
the Information at large, which was ordered to be printed by the
Commons, <hi>Novem.</hi> 10. 1680. and after the Speaker <hi>Williams</hi> was
fined 10000 <hi>l.</hi> for Licenſing it (tho by Order of the Commons)
to be printed.</p>
               <p>The ſame Term (I think) Mr. <hi>Samuel Johnſon,</hi> (commonly
known by the Name of <hi>Julian Johnſon)</hi> was ſentenced by the
Court of <hi>King's Bench,</hi> (Sir <hi>Edward Herbert</hi> Chief Juſtice) to ſtand
three times in the Pillory, and to be whipped from <hi>Newgate</hi> to
<hi>Tyburn,</hi> which was ſeverely executed, for making this humble
and hearty Addreſs to all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants in the Army raiſed

Care of Men of your Profeſſion, (eſpecially becauſe you carry your

wherein you drew your firſt Breath, and breath a free <hi>Engliſh</hi> Air.
Now I deſire you to conſider how well you comply with theſe two main

Is it in the Name of God for his Service, that you have joined your

the <hi>Bible,</hi> and who ſeek to extirpate the Proteſtant Religion with your

and Deſolation amongſt us, and to train up all our Children in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery?
How can you do theſe things, and call your ſelves Proteſtants?</p>
                     <p>And then what Service can be done your Country, by being under the
Command of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, and by bringing the Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a foreign Yoke? Will you help them to make forcible Entry into the
Houſes of your Countrymen, under the Name of <hi>Quartering,</hi> contrary to
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>Petition of Right?</hi> Will you be aiding and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to all the Murders and Outrages, which they ſhall commit by their
void Commiſſions? which were declared Illegal, and ſufficiently blaſted by
both Houſes of Parliament, (if there had been any need of it) for it
was very well known before, that a Papiſt cannot have a Commiſſion,
but by Law is utterly diſabled and diſarmed. Will you exchange your
Birth-right of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws and Liberties, for <hi>Martial</hi> and <hi>Club-Law,</hi>
and help to deſtroy all others, only to be eaten up at laſt your ſelves?
If I know you well, as you are <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, you hate and ſcorn theſe

Papiſts: Be valiant for the Truth, and ſhew your ſelves Men.</p>

               <p>The firſt Lightning, which the dormant Commiſſion of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Affairs</hi> produced, fell upon the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> a Perſon
of Exemplary Vertue and Loyalty, and who, beſides the Nobility
of his Birth, had his Father ſlain in the late Civil Wars, in defence
of the King's Father's Cauſe, and had himſelf, and all his Brothers,
freely and valiantly expoſed their Lives in defence of it: The
Crime alledged againſt him was, that by the King's Letter he did
not ſuſpend Doctor <hi>Sharp</hi> (then Dean of <hi>Norwich,</hi> now Archbiſhop
of <hi>York)</hi> for preaching a Sermon againſt the Frauds and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by a Power as Arbitrary, as that by
which the Commiſſioners acted; and for this theſe Commiſſioners
ſuſpended the Biſhop, tho every one underſtood the true Cauſe
was the Biſhop's Motion in the Houſe of Lords to have debated the
King's Speech. <hi>Tantum Religio potuit ſwadere malorum.</hi>

               <p>I'm perſwaded King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. to make a <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> made the Biſhops out of the moſt obnoxious of the
Clergy, who beſides their profligate Lives, run the King's Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
there to a higher pitch, than <hi>Laud</hi> in the King's Father's
time did in <hi>England:</hi> And that towards the latter end of his Reign
he laid the ſame deſign here; for the Biſhopricks of <hi>Oxford, York,</hi>
                  <pb n="640" facs="tcp:60932:327"/>
St. <hi>David</hi>'s and <hi>Cheſter,</hi> becoming void about the latter end of his
Reign, or beginning of King <hi>James</hi>'s, (I'll not name the Biſhoprick
of <hi>Litchfield</hi> and <hi>Coventry,</hi> for the Petticoat governed in that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
Dr. <hi>Samuel Parker</hi> (whom Mr. <hi>Marvel</hi> in his Rehearſal tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed
calls <hi>Bays)</hi> a Man of a virulent Diſpoſition, and who by
railing againſt the Church got into Preferment, and when he was
in, became a zealous Railer againſt them without, was made Biſhop
of <hi>Oxford;</hi> Dr. <hi>Cartright,</hi> (as high for the Prerogative as <hi>Parker)</hi>
was made Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter:</hi> and the Succeſſion to theſe two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks
was the more obſervable, becauſe <hi>Parker</hi> ſucceeded
Dr. <hi>Fell,</hi> and <hi>Cartright</hi> Dr. <hi>Peirſon,</hi> Men of Piety and Learning,
equal to any in their time: and one <hi>Watſon</hi> (an obſcure Man) was
made Biſhop of St. <hi>David</hi>'s; but the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>York</hi> was
reſerved for a Perſon of another Temper, whom theſe Biſhops
were making way for.</p>
               <p>The Preſidentſhip of <hi>Magdalen</hi> College in <hi>Oxford</hi> becoming void,
and the Fellows fearing a <hi>Mandamus</hi> would be impoſed upon them
for ſome Perſon not qualified by the Statutes, and whom by their
Oaths they could not ſubmit to, choſe Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> for Preſident, a
Perſon qualified by their Statutes for that Place.</p>
               <p>As the Fellows feared, ſo it came to paſs; for the King ſent
them a peremptory <hi>Mandamus</hi> to chuſe the Biſhop of <hi>Oxford
(Bays)</hi> their Preſident; but he being a Perſon not qualified by
the Statutes of their College, which the Fellows were ſworn to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
they in a humble Anſwer excuſed themſelves, as being
otherways obliged, as well by their Oath as Statutes. I will not
repeat the Anger the King expreſs'd hereupon, 'tis in Print; but
ſure ſuch Language was never uſed by any Prince before.</p>
               <p>But if the King's harſh Language will not work the Fellows to
his Will, he will ſend the Commiſſioners of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Affairs</hi>
among them to turn them out of their Fellowſhips, (wherein they
had as much Property, as any other had to any real or perſonal
Eſtate) nor ſhall theſe Commiſſioners ſtay here, but by a new ſtrain
of Tyranny, never practiſed but by Abſolute Tyrants, they make
the Fellows uncapable of any other Eccleſiaſtical Preferments.</p>
               <p>The Fellows thus expelled, the Statutes of the College are
thrown out of Doors, to make room for a Seminary of Jeſuits
and Popiſh Prieſts, as much tending to the Subverſion of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the Statutes of the College.</p>
               <p>But ſee how God in his Providence blaſted theſe things; for the
Biſhop of <hi>Oxford</hi> had ſcarce taken poſſeſſion of his thus new-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
Preſidentſhip, when he died; and you'll ſoon ſee the
Fellows reſtored again in ſpite of theſe Commiſſioners, and
Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> made Biſhop of <hi>Oxford;</hi> as well as Preſident of <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
College.</p>

If the King were zealous in advancing his <hi>Prerogative Royal</hi> both

               <p>The firſt Proclamation which <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> iſſued out was dated <hi>Feb.
21.</hi> 1687. wherein he promiſed to defend the Laws, Liberties,

the Acts of <hi>Settlement and Explanation,</hi> being reſolved firſt to out

did he not ſtay here; and Biſhop <hi>King</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe of the State of

how he proceeded in the deſtroying the Church and State of

               <p>
                  <hi>When the Judges had been above a Year propagating the King's

with the</hi> Penal Laws <hi>and</hi> Teſts <hi>againſt Diſſenters from the Church,
upon the</hi> 25th <hi>of</hi> April 1687, <hi>out comes the King's Declaration to
all his Subjects for</hi> Liberty of Conſcience, <hi>wherein the King declares,</hi>
That it had been a long time his conſtant Senſe and Opinion, that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
ought not to be reſtrained, nor People forced in Matters of meer
Religion; and that it was contrary to his Inclination, as he thought it

Countries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sure no Prince ever acted ſo in Extreams, yet his Actions ſo dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically

ſuch a ſort of Men, whom but little before he had ſlaughter'd, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
and impriſoned, as if he had deſigned to extirpate the
whole Race of them. If to reconcile theſe to Truth, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality,
be not as great a Miracle, as is in any of the Popiſh Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends,
I'll believe them all, and be reconciled to the <hi>Roman</hi>
                  <pb n="642" facs="tcp:60932:328"/>
Catholick Church, how inconſiſtible ſoever the Terms be.</p>
               <p>The generality of the Proteſtant Diſſenters having for near ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
years together, been ſo ſeverely treated by the <hi>Tories,</hi> were as
forward to congratulate the King for his Indulgence in manifold Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes,
as the <hi>Tories</hi> were in King <hi>Charles</hi> his time, in their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
of Abhorrence to petition the King to call a Parliament to
ſettle the Grievances of the Nation: However this Declaration was
ſo drawn in the ſight of every Bird, that (of my knowledg) many
of the ſober thinking Men of the Diſſenters, did both dread and
deteſt it.</p>
               <p>That this Declaration might be more paſſable, <hi>Popiſh</hi> Judges
were made in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Juſtices of the Peace,
and Deputy-Lieutenants all <hi>England</hi> over; the Privy Council was
repleniſhed with Popiſh Privy Counſellors; the <hi>Savoy</hi> was laid open
to inſtruct Youth in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and Popiſh Principles;
and Schools for that purpoſe were encouraged in <hi>London,</hi> and all
other Places in <hi>England:</hi> Four Foreign Popiſh Biſhops, as <hi>Vicars
Apoſtolical,</hi> were allowed in Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction all <hi>England</hi>

<hi>Benediction;</hi> yet I do not find that he beforehand ſent for Leave to
enter the Kingdom, as was obſerved by Queen <hi>Mary, Henry</hi> VIII,
and before.</p>
               <p>The Judges in their Circuits had their private Inſtructions, to
know how Men were affected with the King's <hi>Diſpenſing Power;</hi> and
thoſe who were diſaffected to it, were turned out from the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
and Commiſſion of the Peace.</p>
               <p>Juſtice, Judgment, and Righteouſneſs ſupport the Thrones of
Princes, but theſe were Strangers to this King's ways, other Means
muſt be found out to ſupport and carry them through; a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Army is judged the beſt Expedient: and as the King told the
Parliament at their ſecond Meeting, he had encreaſed his Army
to double what it was before, ſo he made his Word good, that he
would employ Men in it not qualified by the late <hi>Teſts;</hi> and to this
end, <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> having disbanded the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified

               </p>
               <p>This Army thus raiſed againſt Law, committed all manner of
lawleſs Inſolences, though the King by ſeveral Orders would have
had their Quarters reſtrained to Victualling-Houſes, Houſes of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Entertainments, and ſuch as had Licences to ſell Wine and

               <p>And though the King had no other Wars, but againſt the Laws
and Conſtitutions of the Nation, yet he would have the Act of the
<hi>1, 2 Edw.</hi> 6. 2. which makes it Felony, without Benefit of the
Clergy, for any Souldier taking Pay in the King's Service, in his
Wars beyond Sea, or upon Sea, or in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to deſert from his
Officer, to extend to this Army thus raiſed by the King: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> Sir <hi>J. H.</hi> would not expound this
Law to the King's Deſign, he was put out of his Place, and ſo was
Sir <hi>Edward Herbert</hi> from being Chief Juſtice of the <hi>King's Bench,</hi>
to make room for Sir <hi>Robert Wright,</hi> to hang a poor Souldier upon
this Statute; and afterward this Statute did the Work without any
further diſpute.</p>
               <p>Thus this Prince did not only aſſume a Power to controul the
Laws of the Nation at his pleaſure in Civil Affairs, but when he
pleaſed made them bend to his Will to eſtabliſh an illegal Army,
and countenance the Effuſion of Chriſtian Blood: but you'll
ſoon ſee God will blaſt theſe ungodly Ways; and that not the
Arm of Fleſh, but Judgment, Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, eſtabliſh
the Thrones of Princes.</p>
               <p>Thus Affairs ſtood in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> in the year
1687. wherein I ſuppoſe no Hiſtory mentions ſo great and violent
Alterations in ſo little time, as in this King's Reign, all tending to
introduce a Foreign Power, and to enſlave the Nation, yet ſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
endured by it; but the Dangers of theſe Deſigns were not
circumſcribed within the bounds of this Nation, but extended into
<hi>France,</hi> where for above twenty years, a Conſpiracy was carried on
for promoting theſe Deſigns thus far advanced; ſo that the Year
1688 had a much more terrible Aſpect upon <hi>England,</hi> than the
Year 1588 had, when <hi>Philip</hi> the II. deſigned the Conqueſt of it:
for then the Nation was firm and intire for its own Intereſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
this Year it was not only torn in pieces by internal Diſcords, but
had an Army and Fleet deſigned to join with the <hi>French</hi> King, in
propagating his boundleſs Ambition, not only upon <hi>England,</hi> but
upon the Empire of <hi>Germany, Spain, Holland,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
and other Princes of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the beginning of the year 1688, a Gentleman of High
Jeſuited Principles told me, The States of <hi>Holland</hi> were Rebels
againſt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and that I ſhould ſoon ſee the King of
<hi>France</hi> would call them to an Account for it, and humble them;
and that the <hi>French</hi> King would aſſiſt our King with Men of War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I took more heed to this, becauſe I knew that he was frequently vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
by ſeveral Jeſuits, in whoſe Counſels I believe the <hi>French</hi>
King's Deſigns this Year were locked up; for my Lord of <hi>Sunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in his Letter, recited in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Deſertion,</hi> fol. 32.
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:60932:329"/>
proteſts he knew nothing of a League between the King; yet
you will ſee it come out another way. But my Lord of <hi>Sunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
ſays, that <hi>French</hi> Ships were offered to join with our Fleet,
which was refuſed; however this ſhews there was a Deſign contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by theſe Princes; yet at preſent the Affairs of <hi>France</hi> ſeemed
to look another way, and a <hi>French</hi> Fleet and Souldiers in them are
ſent to <hi>Canada;</hi> the Deſign and Succeſs you will ſoon hear of.</p>
               <p>The King having thus, as he thought, laid a Foundation (tho
it proved a very Sandy one) of his Deſigns; and to ſhew how Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
he would be in them, upon the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> paſſed an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in Council, that his Declaration of <hi>Indulgence</hi> ſhould be read
in all Churches and Chappels in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> in time of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service, and that all the Biſhops in their reſpective Dioceſſes
ſhould take care to have this done accordingly.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops who knew the Declaration of <hi>Indulgence</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to conjoin the Proteſtant Diſſenters with the Popiſh, to
ruin the Eſtabliſhed Church, eaſily foreſaw that the Order to them
was to pick a Quarrel with them; for the King might have ordered
it to be read without, as well as by them: And, beſides the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of it, it was deemed an undecent thing, that the Fathers of
the Church, in time of Divine Setvice, ſhould be the Inſtruments
to give a Liberty to all whether they ſhould come to Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
or not.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> who ſtood ſuſpended, theſ Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Bath</hi> and
<hi>Wells, Ely Peterborough, Chicheſter,</hi> St. <hi>Aſaph,</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> were in
or about the Town; and this Order of Reading the Declaration in
Churches was ſerved upon them.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops in a humble Petition to the King gave their Reaſons
in Writing, (but ſo cautiouſly, that after it was drawn up, they
would let no other Man ſee it before they preſented it) why they
could not comply with the Order of Council.</p>
               <p>The Chancellor, tho he thought his Commiſſion big enough to
ſuſpend the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and Vice-Chancellor of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> and
expel the Maſter and Fellows of <hi>Magalen</hi> College in <hi>Oxford,</hi> yet it
ſeems did not think it ſufficient to ſuſpend theſe Biſhops, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
adviſed the King ('twas ſaid) to try them upon an Information
of <hi>High Miſdemeanour</hi> in the <hi>King's Bench;</hi> and in order to it they
were committed Priſoners to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Accordingly the Biſhops were tried in the <hi>King's Bench</hi> in <hi>Trinty</hi>
Term following, upon an Information of <hi>High Miſdemeanour,</hi> for
their Petition to the King: but how ſecure ſoever the King and
Chancellor thought themſelves of the Judges, and tho Sir <hi>Robert
Wright,</hi> who was Chief Juſtice, and Sir <hi>Richard Allibone</hi> (a known
Papiſt) were two of them, yet they were not all of a Piece, for
Mr. Juſtice <hi>Powel</hi> both learnedly and ſtoutly defended the Biſhops
Cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="645" facs="tcp:60932:329"/>
If we look down to the Bar, we ſhall ſee as ſtrange a mixture
as in the Bench; for the late Attorney-General <hi>Sawyer,</hi> and Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor
<hi>Finch,</hi> who were ſo zealous to find my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Colonel
<hi>Sidney,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> &amp;c. guilty of High Treaſon, and for Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
of Charters, now they are turned out, are as zealous for
the acquittal of the Biſhops; and the then Solicitor-General, of a
moſt zealous Proſecutor of Abhorrers, and Searcher into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> as zealous for finding their Miſdemeanour.
However the Jury acquitted the Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Unleſs it were when <hi>Monk</hi> came into the City the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,
1659-60.</hi> and Colonel <hi>Cloberry</hi> told the Citizens at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi>
they ſhould have a free Parliament, or when King <hi>Charles</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>London</hi> the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> following, never were ſuch loud Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of Joy expreſt, as upon the Acquittal of the Biſhops; nor
did the Bounds of the City terminate this Joy, but it flew like
Lightning to <hi>Hounſlow Heath,</hi> where the King would be preſent to
ſee the Army exerciſed, wherein he truſted (more than in Juſtice
and Righteouſneſs) to accompliſh his Deſign: It ſeems the King
was treated that Day by my Lord of <hi>Feverſham.</hi> (General of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my)
in his Tent, when the News of the Biſhops Acquittal arrived
at the Army, which entertained it with a general Shout; the King
('twas ſaid) was ſtartled at it, and ſent the Earl to enquire the
Cauſe; the Earl in return told the King, 'twas nothing but the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
Joy for the Acquittal of the Biſhops: <hi>And call you that nothing?</hi>
replied the King, who was much diſcompoſed upon it; and well
he might, for now he ſaw how little Confidence was to be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the Army he ſo much relied upon.</p>
               <p>It's a Duty incumbent upon Mankind, to honour and worſhip
God, and give him Thanks for the Benefits received from him, and
to petition and pray to him for continuance of them: Next after
God, it's the Duty of all Subjects to honour the King, for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
they receive by his Juſtice and Protection, and to petition
and pray Relief from him for Oppreſſions and Injuries, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be redreſſed by the ordinary Courſe of Law, or where the
Miniſters of the Law either cannot, or refuſe to do Juſtice.</p>
               <p>It's therefore the Wiſdom of our Conſtitution, that Parliaments
frequently meet, not only to receive Petitions againſt Oppreſſions
or Injuries received, which were not or could not be redreſſed by
the King's Miniſters of the Law, but alſo to correct and puniſh the
King's Miniſters themſelves, if they tranſgreſſed or neglected their
Duty.</p>
               <p>But tho frequent Parliaments are the moſt proper Expedients
for the Subjects herein, yet oftentimes Accidents may be, which
will not ſtay for relief by Parliament, as in Caſe of the Biſhops.
In <hi>May</hi> they are ordered to have the King's Declaration of <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi>
read in all Churches and Chappels of their reſpective Dioceſſes;
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:60932:330"/>
and to do it, and to give no Reaſons why they could not do it,
would have been a manifeſt Contempt of the King's Authority;
they could not do it either in Honour or Conſcience; and by an
humble Petition and Addreſs, repreſent this to the King; and for
ought appeared then, the King never intended to call another
Parliament, till he had modelled them as much to his Will, as <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
did <hi>Praiſe-God Barebone</hi>'s Parliament.</p>
               <p>This Petition is made a <hi>High Miſdemeanour,</hi> and the Biſhops com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
upon it, and Father <hi>Petre,</hi> the Club of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney
and Solicitor-General, <hi>Graham, Burton,</hi> &amp;c. are all plotting
how to make it ſo: So as now the Kingdom is without all hopes of
a free Parliament, and yet it is a <hi>High Miſdemeanour</hi> to addreſs to,
or petition the King.</p>
               <p>And that this Order upon the Biſhops to enjoin the Reading of
the King's Declaration for <hi>Indulgence,</hi> was a Deſign upon their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
as well as upon the Church, is apparent; for after their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittal,
Orders from the Commiſſioners of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Affairs</hi> were
ſent into all parts of <hi>England,</hi> to return an Account to the Lord
Chancellor, of thoſe that refuſed to read the Declaration of <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi>
that they might be proceeded againſt for their Contempt:
but the Reign and Rage of theſe Commiſſioners was too hot to laſt
long; and now let's ſee what return of Praiſes and Thankſgivings
the Biſhops can make to God for their Deliverance.</p>
               <p>God requires Truth in the inward Parts, and that it ſhould go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
all the Intentions, Speech and Actions of every Man, in his
Converſation with Man, yet more in his Prayers and Petitions to
God; and if it be an High Crime of Hypocriſy to ſpeak or act
contrary to a Man's Knowledg or Belief, for the end deſigned
thereby is to deceive another, though God cannot be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it's a greater Crime to approach his <hi>Omniſcience</hi> with Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Petitions contrary to a Man's certain Knowledg or firm
Belief.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted, that the Biſhops underſtood the King's
Declaration of <hi>Indulgence</hi> was an unlawful Act, and that if they had
ſubmitted to the King's Will to have enjoined it to have been read
in all Churches and Chappels of their reſpective Dioceſſes, it had
been an unlawful Act, which was one Reaſon they could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the King's Will; and that this Declaration was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
a Favour to the <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters,</hi> but a Deſign to ruin
the eſtabliſhed Religion, and Church of <hi>England;</hi> and the enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Biſhops to have read; was a Deſign upon their Perſons,
as well as the Declaration was upon the Church; and that the King
profeſſed himſelf to be of the Popiſh Religion, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
and declared to be Idolatry, in the worſhipping Images,
and derogatory to God's Honour by Invocation of Saints, whereby
they grant to Creatures an Omniſcience, which is inſeparable from
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:60932:330"/>
God, and only to be aſcribed to him; and that the King had owned
the <hi>Papal Power,</hi> (which not only claims a Dominion over all Kings
and Kingdoms to be at the Pope's diſpoſal, and who had declared
the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be Heretical, Schiſmatical and Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Perſons, with whom no Faith is to be kept, but had aſſumed
a Power equal or ſuperiour to God himſelf, in diſpenſing with
God's Laws, and ſetting its own above them) by ſending his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
to the Pope, and receiving his <hi>Nuncio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With what Conſcience then could the Biſhops approach God's Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
in their higheſt Acts of Devotion, and in the Prayer for the
Parliament, declare to God that he is their moſt religious King;
and in the <hi>Litany</hi> to pray to God to keep and ſtrengthen the King
in the Worſhip of God, or Religion which the King profeſt?</p>
               <p>And how could they delare to God, he is their moſt gracious
Sovereign, when he had impriſoned them for not ſubmitting to
his unlawful Will, and had owned a Power which had declared
them Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, and Sacrilegious Perſons; who were
by all ways and means to be extirpated from the Face of the Earth?
Yet the Biſhops by their Canonical Obedience were as much oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hereto, and to enjoin the Clergy in their reſpective Dioceſſes to
offer theſe Praiſes to God, as they were not to obey the King's
Will by enjoining the King's Declaration of <hi>Indulgence</hi> to be read
by all the Clergy in their Dioceſſes. To this <hi>Dilemma</hi> had the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Church and State in King <hi>Charles</hi> the II's Reign (tho intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it againſt the <hi>Presbyterians)</hi> by their Act of <hi>Vniformity,</hi> brought
the Church and State too in the Reign of King <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But leſt this eſtabliſhing of <hi>Popery</hi> ſhould have no longer ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
than in the King's Life, a new Miracle is to be added to the
Legend; for the next day after the Biſhops were committed to
the <hi>Tower,</hi> the Queen was brought to Bed of a Prince of <hi>Wales:</hi>
ſo that now they had got a Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Queen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Conſecrated Clouts, and the Pope by his <hi>Nuncio</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
God-father, a Foundation ſo infallible is laid for exalting the
Papal Chair, and extirpating the Peſtilent Northern Hereſy, that
it's Hereſy to doubt it.</p>
               <p>But Man purpoſes, and God diſpoſes; and in truth, without
God's ſpecial Aſſiſtance, not only theſe Dominions of <hi>England,
Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but all the Weſtern Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> were not
to be retrieved out of (I may ſay) even a deſperate State; for in
<hi>England</hi> the King had a ſtanding Army of above 20000 Men, and
the <hi>Whigs</hi> were but too forward to congratulate the King in his
Deſigns, and in humouring him, in giving him up their Charters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as the <hi>Tories</hi> in King <hi>Charles</hi> his Reign, in their Abhorrences of
the King's calling a Parliament, and as forward then, as the <hi>Whigs</hi>
now in ſurrendring their Charters: The Proteſtant Army in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
not only disbanded by <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> and a Popiſh Army ſet up.
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:60932:331"/>
but the Proteſtants diſarmed; and <hi>Scotland</hi> ſo perfectly ſubdued,
that there the King's <hi>Abſolute Will</hi> without reſerve, muſt paſs for
Law: The King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſo weak, as not able to defend himſelf,
much leſs relieve others; the Empire engaged in a War againſt
the <hi>Turks</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> ſo as the Weſtern Parts were in no Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to repel the Impreſſion the <hi>French</hi> ſhould make upon it: The
Kingdoms of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> remote, and at ſuch natural
Enmity with one another, that if one ſhould ſide with <hi>France</hi> or
<hi>England,</hi> the other would engage againſt it; and tho <hi>Holland</hi> were
conſiderable elſewhere at Sea, yet their Strength at Sea was infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but much more in Conjunction of the <hi>French</hi>
with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However ſomething muſt be done, for Modeſty in this State
had been the higheſt Crime; and of all Foreign Princes, the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> was moſt immediately concerned, not only in the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the <hi>French</hi> King upon his Principality of <hi>Orange,</hi> and
the Dangers which threatned the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> by the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Grandeur of the <hi>French,</hi> but by the King's Arbitrary Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in <hi>England;</hi> for the Princeſs was the Preſumptive Heir to the
Crown of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> And ſince it is the Laws and
Conſtitutions which erect theſe Nations into Kingdoms, whereof
the King is the Head, then if the King deſtroys the Laws and
Conſtitutions, he is neither King, nor the Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive
Heir to them; beſides, ſince the King had aſſumed a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Diſpenſing with the Laws, he might as well in Diſpenſing with
the Succeſſion; and the Prince was well aſſured, neither thoſe
about the King, nor the Pope, would much favour his, or his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's
Title to the Crown; nor was the introducing the Prince of
<hi>Wales</hi> into the World intended, to have either the Prince or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
come to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> thus injured by both theſe Kings, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
denied the Benefit of any Humane Laws, for redreſs has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to God and his Sword for relief, and oppoſes the Juſtice of
his Cauſe againſt the Potency of his Adverſaries: Nor does he
take up his Sword to vindicate his own Rights only, but for reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Rights, Laws and Privileges invaded by King <hi>James,</hi> and to
put a ſtop to the <hi>French</hi> King's boundleſs Ambition and Tyranny,
in Murdering, Ravaging and Deſtroying, rather than making a War
upon all his neighbouring Princes, not diſpoſſeſt and ruined by
him. A Deſign ſo great, by ſo little a Prince, as no leſs than a
Divine Power could inſpire him to ſuch an Undertaking!</p>
               <p>The Prince theſe two laſt years had ſeveral Conferences with the
Electors of <hi>Brandenburg, Saxony,</hi> and the Princes of the Houſe of
<hi>Lunenburg,</hi> and other Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> it's believed in concert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Meaſures how to behave themſelves againſt the Deſigns of
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:60932:331"/>
theſe two Kings; but the Reſults were ſo ſecret, that I find no
mention of them.</p>
               <p>But how ſecret ſoever theſe Reſults were, yet the Preparations
to put them in Execution could be no Secret, eſpecially the Naval
Preparations by Sea; though the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſador aſſured the
King, they were not intended againſt him, yet refuſed to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
the Deſign.</p>
               <p>At this time there was not only a high Ferment in all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt the King's Proceedings, but in the Army againſt its
mixture with <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers and Soldiers; which put the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

perſwade the King my Maſter, with reaſon, that this Arming
threatens <hi>England.</hi> Wherefore His Majeſty hath commanded me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to the States, on his Part, that the Bonds of Friendſhip and Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
between him and the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> will oblige him
(the <hi>French</hi> King) not only to aſſiſt him, (the King of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain)</hi>
                  <pb n="650" facs="tcp:60932:332"/>
but alſo to look on the firſt Act of Hoſtility that ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by your Troops, and your Fleet, againſt his Majeſty of <hi>Great
Britain,</hi> as a manifeſt Rupture of the Peace, and a Breach with his
Crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though the</hi> Dutch <hi>made no Anſwer to this Memorial, yet they
made no Bones to make this Anſwer to the Marqueſs</hi> d' Albeville's:
That they had armed in Imitation of his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty, and
other Princes, and that they had thereby given no juſt Cauſe of Offence
by arming, when all other Princes were in Motion; and that they were
long ſince convinced of the Alliance which the King, his Maſter, had
treated with <hi>France,</hi> and what had been mentioned to them by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>le Count d' Avaux</hi> in his Memorial.</p>
               <p>This Anſwer King <hi>James</hi> took all one, as if the <hi>Dutch</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
War againſt him; and all the Eyes of <hi>England</hi> are now
turned toward <hi>Holland,</hi> as if from thence they expected Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from the Deſigns of King <hi>James,</hi> and his Popiſh Crew; and
the Fathers and Sons too of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are at as much
Variance in their private and publick Prayers to God, as <hi>Whig</hi> and
<hi>Tory</hi> were in their Humours; for in their private Prayers they pray
for Proſperity to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and in the <hi>Liturgy</hi> they
pray that God would be King <hi>James</hi>'s Defender and Keeper, giving
him Victory over all his Enemies.</p>
               <p>God was pleaſed to prefer the private Prayers of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
before thoſe of the Church, and to have granted both, had
been impoſſible, and to put a hook into the <hi>French</hi> King's Noſe,
who turned thoſe Forces which he had raiſed (not for the Peace
and Tranquillity of <hi>Europe,</hi> as <hi>d' Avaux</hi> ſaid in his Memorial to the
<hi>Dutch</hi> States) upon the Empire, where without any Declaration
of War, or Cauſe alledged, he firſt fell upon <hi>Philipsburg,</hi> which
he took, and after <hi>Heydelberg</hi> and <hi>Mainheim;</hi> and while he was thus
engaged, he left the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> free to vindicate his Cauſe
againſt King <hi>James:</hi> whereas if the <hi>French</hi> King had turned thoſe
Forces which he employed againſt the Empire upon the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Netherlands,</hi> (and he might as juſtly have done this as that)
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> would have had little Force, and leſs Leaſure
to have made any Attempt upon King <hi>James:</hi> Thus God is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
often to turn the Wiſdom of the Crafty (I will not ſay Wiſe)
into Folly and Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>You have heard before how the <hi>French<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> King in the beginning of
the Year had ſent out a Fleet to <hi>Canada;</hi> whereupon the Company
of <hi>Hudſons-Bay</hi> repreſented to the King their Apprehenſions, it
was a Deſign upon their Factories and Plantations, and ſo it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded;
for the <hi>French</hi> ſeized upon a Fort and Plantation of theirs,
called Fort <hi>Charles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="651" facs="tcp:60932:332"/>
Towards the latter end of the Summer, the King, without the
Knowledg of <hi>Hudſons-Bay</hi> Company, entred into a Treaty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with his Brother of <hi>France,</hi> in reference to the Trade of
<hi>Canada,</hi> wherein it was concluded, that the Forts and Factories
ſhould be reciprocally enjoyed in the ſame ſtate they were at the
Concluſion of this Treaty, the <hi>French</hi> having taken the Fort and
Factory of <hi>Charles</hi> about three Months before. So little did this
King regard the Safety and Welfare of his Subjects, wherein his
Majeſty and Honour was founded, for to pleaſure and endear his
Brother of <hi>France,</hi> from whom he expected mighty things for the
Advancement of his Prerogative without reſerve, in <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have I brought down the Hiſtory of this King's Reign, to
the Hiſtory of the <hi>Deſertion,</hi> where at large and particularly you
may read, how by a Wonder, equal to King <hi>Charles</hi> his Coming
in, King <hi>James</hi> went out: And if no human Proſpect could have
foreſeen where the Tyranny of King <hi>Charles</hi> the I's Reign would
have ended, if the <hi>Long Parliament</hi> in 1640 had not put a full Stop
to it; ſo no unintereſted Perſon was ſo purblind, as not to ſee if
the Heroick Magnanimity of this King in his Queen's, his own
and the Nation's Right, and for the common Safety of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi>
had not put a Stop to King <hi>James</hi> his Deſigns, but the <hi>Popiſh</hi>
Superſtition, and <hi>French</hi> Tyranny, would have been impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe Kingdoms, and have overſpread <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We admit theſe four Kings of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Race had an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
Title to have governed <hi>England,</hi> by the Laws and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of it; yet no Hereditary King hath any higher Title, nor any
Man a Right to do Wrong; and for an Hereditary King to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
otherways, is a greater Tyranny, than if an Uſurper does,
by how much he adds Perfidiouſneſs, and Breach of his Truſt to
it.</p>
               <p>Yet ſo it was, that theſe four laſt Kings of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Race,
which ſhould have been the Guardians of <hi>England,</hi> in preſerving
the Laws and Conſtitutions of it, and to have maintained the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of it abroad, made it their Buſineſs to have ſubverted them;
and being thereby always at Variance and Contentions with their
Subjects, loſt their own and the Nation's Honour abroad; and by
taking no Care of the foreign Concerns of the Nation, became
contemptible to other Nations: Nay, the laſt three Kings, inſtead
of reſtraining the <hi>French</hi> Ambition and Tyranny, joined with them
in advancing of them; as if they deſigned to make the <hi>French</hi>
King an Univerſal Monarch, as well as to deſtroy the Conſtitutions
of <hi>England.</hi> And I would know a Reaſon why, now his Majeſty
King <hi>William</hi> has, by God's Bleſſing, redeemed this Nation from
the imminent Danger which the <hi>French</hi> King, in conjunction with
King <hi>James,</hi> deſigned upon the Weſtern Parts of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> as
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:60932:333"/>
well as theſe Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> any

               <p>MY Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> compares Times to Ways, ſome more plain

               <p>In theſe Treatiſes we have given an Account of the manifold
Varieties of Accidents which have hapned for above 80 Years

and <hi>Grecian</hi> Hiſtories may give Inſtances of the like by Land, yet
none of them can ſhew the like of the <hi>French</hi> Grandeur by Sea,
in little more than forty Years; but more eſpecially, in that this
was acquired in the Face of two neighbouring Nations, either of
which could have preſcribed Laws to all the World beſides here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
the one claiming the Dominion of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas, the other
of the <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>Southern</hi> Ocean.</p>
               <p>On the other Side, <hi>Spain,</hi> which in the Reign of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
was both the Envy and Dread of theſe Weſtern parts of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,</hi>
is now fallen into that abject State, as it is ſcarce in the
Power of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> to uphold it from falling under the Dominion
of the <hi>French;</hi> and this Hiſtory in ſome Meaſure hath ſhewn the
Cauſes both of the Grandeur of <hi>France,</hi> and the Cadency of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the natural Advantages which the <hi>French</hi> had above other
Nations, after the Death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was added, that
<hi>James</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Intereſt it
was to have reſtrained the ambitious and aſpiring Humour of the
<hi>French,</hi> were degenerous Princes, wholly given up to be governed
by Flatterers and Favourites, and made it their Buſineſs to uſurp
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:60932:333"/>
another Juriſdiction over the Nation, than they could claim by
their Inherent Birth-right; ſo that if the <hi>Long Parliament</hi> in 1640
had not put a Stop to <hi>Charles</hi> his Career, no mortal Creature could
have foreſeen where it would have ended.</p>
               <p>King <hi>James,</hi> not to diſturb his licentious and voluptuous Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
ſtood only ſtill, and looking on, whilſt <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>13th</hi> had
near broke the Intereſt of the Reformed in <hi>France;</hi> but <hi>Charles</hi> in
the firſt Act of his Reign lent the <hi>French</hi> a Fleet to ſubdue the
<hi>Rochellers,</hi> at that time ſuperior to <hi>Lewis</hi> by Sea; and as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately
in the ſecond Year of his Reign made War with <hi>France,</hi>
having in the firſt Year made War againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> whereby
both <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> joining againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> brought that
Loſs and Diſhonour upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in the Expedition of the Iſle
of <hi>Rhee;</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> being as looſe in his Reſolutions, as inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
in his Actions, after the Death of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi>
who had engaged him in both theſe Wars, made a ſecret Peace
with the <hi>French,</hi> and left the <hi>Reformed</hi> out of it, though he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
them to join with him in the War, whereby the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the <hi>Reformed</hi> was rooted out: So that the Original of the
<hi>French</hi> Grandeur by Sea and Land, may be truly aſcribed to theſe
two Hereditary Princes, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Charles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Tyranny of <hi>Charles</hi> his Reign had degenerated into
the Uſurpations of the <hi>Rump,</hi> they thinking to prejudice the <hi>Dutch</hi>
made the Act of <hi>Navigation,</hi> which crampt up all the foreign Trades
of <hi>England,</hi> and the fiſhing Trade (which above all others is the
Nurſery of Seamen, and encreaſe of Navigation) to <hi>Engliſh</hi>-built
Ships, and ſail'd with ¾ <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whether there be Ships, or Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
or not, and without any Conſideration of Times, whether
of War or Peace.</p>
               <p>Though we have in this Hiſtory, and in <hi>The Reaſons of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
of the Strength, Wealth and Trade of</hi> England, and alſo in the
<hi>View of the Act of Navigation,</hi> in reference to the Laws which yet
ſtand unrepealed, to the Trades for Maſts, Rafters, Boards, foreign
Oak, Timber, Pitch and Tar, and to the Trades for rough Hemp
and Flax, and to the fiſhing Trades, and alſo to the Safety of the
Nation againſt Foreign Powers, at large demonſtrated the Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this Law, and the dangerous Conſequences of it; yet it is
fit even here to take ſome Notice of it, and of the Navigation of
the Nation before the Act, and how the Caſe ſtands now by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of it.</p>
               <p>Before the <hi>Rump</hi> contrived the Act of Navigation, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
as the Traders told me, alone fiſhed upon the Coaſts of <hi>Iſeland</hi> and
<hi>Weſtmony</hi> for <hi>Ling,</hi> and the Cod-fiſh called <hi>Haberdin;</hi> and at that
time the Town of <hi>Alborough</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> as I was informed, fiſhed
yearly to thoſe Seas with 35 Sail of Veſſels, called <hi>Iſelands-Barks;</hi>
and the Town of <hi>Sould</hi> or <hi>Southold,</hi> with 15; and <hi>Great Yarmouth</hi>
                  <pb n="654" facs="tcp:60932:334"/>
with manifold more, the Number I cannot tell: but this I can tell,
That beſides <hi>London,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> which
they ſupplied with this ſort of Fiſh, as alſo the Navy Royal, and
other Ships, with this ſort of Proviſion, the Town of <hi>Yarmouth</hi>
yearly exported to <hi>Calice, St. Valery, Diep, Havre de Grace, St. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes,
Breſt,</hi> and other parts of <hi>France, 150000 Haberdin</hi> and <hi>Ling;</hi>
and by their Trades with theſe, returned Sails and Nets for their
Navigation and Fiſheries. <hi>Wells</hi> and <hi>Lyn</hi> in <hi>Norfolk</hi> too, drove
Trades into theſe Seas, but I am not informed in how many Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels;
but I have heard the Inhabitants of <hi>Wells</hi> complain, that they
have almoſt loſt their Trades, and I belive <hi>Lyn</hi> wholly.</p>
               <p>Before the Act of Navigation, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from the Weſtern
Ports drove threefold a greater Trade in the <hi>Newfound-Land</hi> Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
than the <hi>French;</hi> whereas the <hi>French</hi> now drive above twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
more the Trade to <hi>Newfound-Land</hi> Fiſhery than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do:
And I have heard Sir <hi>William Booth</hi> ſay, he had ſeen in one Year
above 100 Sail of great <hi>French</hi> Veſſels, of 20 and 30 Guns, ſail in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Straits</hi> from their <hi>Newfound-Land</hi> Fiſhery, beſides ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
<hi>France</hi> with them, and alſo their Trades to <hi>Spain</hi> and
<hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before the Act of Navigation, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
drove conſiderable Trades to <hi>Greenland</hi> for Whales; which
Trades, as they are wholly loſt to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſo are they driven
by the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Hamburghers,</hi> and in a great meaſure carried on
by the <hi>French.</hi> I remember, that the next Year after this Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> took 14 of theſe <hi>French</hi> Veſſels, in their Return
from the Whale Fiſhery: and as this Fiſhery is wholly loſt to the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> (which will never be retrieved by making it a Monopoly)
ſo is that of the Town of <hi>Great Yarmouth</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> upon the
account of the <hi>Iſeland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmony</hi> Fiſhery, and the reſt of the
Trades of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in that Fiſhery, not one tenth of what it
was before the Act of Navigation; nor from the Weſtern Ports to
the <hi>Newfound-Land</hi> Fiſhery, one fifth of what it was before the
Act of Navigation: and I wiſh the Parliament, at their next ſitting,
would enquire into the Truth hereof, to prove me a Liar. I ſay,
That the Fiſhing Trades, above all others, encreaſe Navigation
and Mariners; and if the Cauſes of the Cadency of our Fiſheries
and Navigation be not removed, the Loſs of both will be inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
the Conſequences whereof will be ſo dreadful to the Nation,
that I tremble to think of them: for as we decline, both <hi>French</hi>
and <hi>Dutch</hi> will raiſe themſelves out of our Ruin.</p>
               <p>Every Ship is made of her Hull, Maſts, and Rigging, which are
her Sails and Cables: Timber for the Hull (or Hulk) of a Ship
we have in <hi>England;</hi> but I have ſhewed elſewhere, how impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Timber is in all our Navigations, except the <hi>New-Caſtle</hi>
Trade, and ſo dear in the Carriage and Working, that the
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:60932:334"/>
                  <hi>Dutch</hi> build the Hulks of Ships, of like Dimenſions, for leſs than
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> can; and by their great Experience in Building, build
Ships for all ſorts of Trades more conveniently; ſo that a Ship of
like Dimenſions, <hi>Dutch</hi> built, ſhall carry near one ſixth more
Fraight than an <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pitch, Tar, and Maſts, we have not of our own, but trade ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
to <hi>Norway</hi> for them; and as we order the curing of our
Hemp in <hi>England,</hi> it's not only dearer here than it may be had
from <hi>Liefland</hi> and <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> but ſo ſpalt (as they call it) that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
made of it will not endure the Streſs of Weather, when Ships
ride at Anchor, as foreign Hemp will.</p>
               <p>Before the Act of Navigation, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> traded to <hi>Norway</hi> in
<hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſels, or Bottoms, and then imported Maſts, Raff, Pitch,
Tar; and this the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might do by the Act of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 13.
and then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> imported them ſo cheap, that the <hi>Norwegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
could build but ſix ſmall Veſſels to trade into <hi>England:</hi> but
after the Act of Navigation, when the <hi>Norway</hi> Trade was reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the <hi>Norwegians</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> in their inconvenient dear-built
Ships, in little more than two Years the <hi>Norwegians</hi> encreaſed their
Ships from ſix to above ſixty, and thoſe of double Dimenſions
than the former were: but after <hi>Oliver</hi> diſpenſed with the Act of
Navigation, the <hi>Engliſh Norway</hi> Merchants imported Goods ſo
cheap, that the <hi>Norwegians</hi> were forced to ſell their Veſſels for
want of Employment. This Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smith, Norway</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
were ready to have teſtified before a Committee of the
Commons, when Endeavours were uſed in 1667 for the free Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of Timber, Board, and Raff, after the burning of the
City of <hi>London:</hi> Tho theſe be dead, yet I am aſſured Sir <hi>William
Warren</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Hammond, Norway</hi> Merchants, know this to
be true.</p>
               <p>But the Inhabitants of <hi>Liefland</hi> and <hi>Pruſſia</hi> trade not with us,
and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> by the Cheapneſs of their Navigation, and full
Fraight of their Veſſels, import rough Hemp and Flax from <hi>Lief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Pruſſia</hi> one third cheaper than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> can; and when
theſe are converted into Manufacture of the Cordage and Sails, it's
free for the <hi>Dutch</hi> to import them into <hi>England</hi> by the Act of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation;
whereby we do not only loſe the Employment of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
thouſands of poor People, and depend upon the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but
pay one fourth more for theſe than if rough Hemp and Flax were
freely imported.</p>
               <p>From hence it was, and I ſpeak this of my own Knowledg,
that in the Year 1651 I was part Owner of a Veſſel, built at <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſwick,</hi>
before the Act of Navigation; and of another, built by
the ſame Builder in 1655; and this latter coſt near one ſixth in
proportion more than the former; and the Reaſon the Builder
gave was, the Dearneſs of Maſts, Cordage, and Sails: and I have
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:60932:335"/>
no Reaſon to believe the Caſe is now any better, the Reaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame, and our Timber much dearer, and Carriage farther;
ſo that I do believe the Carriage of our Timber to the Rivers
where Ships are built, coſts more than the <hi>Dutch</hi> pay for their
Timber where they build Ships. Add hereto, That our Fiſhing,
and other Veſſels in Navigation, require one third more Hands to
navigate them, than the <hi>Dutch</hi> (and for ought I know than the
<hi>French)</hi> of like Dimenſions.</p>
               <p>Now conſider, the Fiſh, in all Fiſheries, coſts nothing but the
Catching and Curing; and that Nation which can catch them
cheap, and cure them beſt, are ſure of a foreign Trade for them
againſt any other: and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by the Act, being obliged to
fiſh in double dearer Veſſels, and more inconveniently built, and
ſail'd by one third more hands than the <hi>Dutch</hi> (or <hi>French</hi> either,
for ought I know) have eternally fixed the Fiſhing Trade upon
the Coaſt of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> loſt the <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
Trade, and retain not one fifth of the Trades we had to
<hi>Iſeland</hi> and <hi>Newfound-Land</hi> before the Act of Navigation.</p>
               <p>After the Diſſolution of the <hi>Rump, Oliver</hi> ruled; and tho for
about two Years before his Death he gave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſome Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
in building Veſſels, by diſpenſing with the Act of Navigation,
in reference to the <hi>Norway</hi> Trade, yet he took no care to relieve
them by diſpenſing with it, for the free Importation of rough
Hemp and Flax from <hi>Liefland</hi> and <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> for fitting up our Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
and Employment of our poor People, Men, Women, and
Children; and tho he did well in ſo far diſpenſing with the Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
I'm ſure he did ill by his frantick breaking with <hi>Spain,</hi> and
joining with the <hi>French</hi> againſt it, to the irreparable Loſs of the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> and not only to the endangering the Safety of <hi>England,</hi>
but of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>

               <p>It is not foreign to this Deſign, if Notice be taken, that after
King <hi>James</hi> I. became King of <hi>England,</hi> to the Reſtoration of King
<hi>Charles</hi> II. only <hi>Philip</hi> III. and <hi>Philip</hi> IV. were Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
both zealous bigotted Princes to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Superſtition, and both
weak and effeminate Princes, wholly govern'd by Favourites; and
<hi>Philip</hi> IV. a luxurious and vicious Prince; and that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> II.
after the Victory at <hi>Prague,</hi> endeavoured to ſubject the Freedom
of <hi>Germany</hi> by force, which brought the <hi>Swedes</hi> into <hi>Germany;</hi> and
the <hi>French</hi> ſiding with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> took <hi>Philipsburg</hi> and <hi>Briſac</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which opened the two Paſſages into the Empire, by
which this preſent King has been enabled to make thoſe Wars and
Ravages in the Empire which have ſince ſucceeded.</p>
               <p>After the Reſtoration of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. the whole Series of his
Reign was employed in aſſiſting the <hi>French</hi> in all their ambitious
Deſigns; ſo did the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Dane,</hi> when he had engaged them
in a War with <hi>England;</hi> and the <hi>Oxford</hi> Parliament firſt made the
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:60932:335"/>
Act againſt the Importation of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattel, whereby they disjoin'd
the Intereſt and Dependency of <hi>Ireland</hi> upon <hi>England,</hi> and fixt it
upon <hi>France</hi> and other Countries which traded with them, and
enabled the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> to victual Ships cheaper in their
Fiſheries, and other Trades, than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could, as much to
their Benefit, as Prejudice to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How King <hi>James</hi> II's Conjunction with the <hi>French</hi> had brought
theſe Nations and <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> to the Brink of Deſtruction, was ſaid
in his Reign. In this ſtate theſe Kingdoms ſtood, when God was
pleaſed to give them Deliverance by the Interpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Majeſty; and now all the neighbouring Nations upon <hi>France,</hi>
I mean <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Empire, Savoy,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as well as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
were alarmed at their common Danger, by the <hi>French</hi> Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Grandure; and all their Eyes were upon <hi>England,</hi> as if
from thence they expected Safety: and now was the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
again become the Arbitrator of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> after the four
former Kings were ſo contemptible, and neglected by it. But in
two things the <hi>French</hi> King's Ambition, or rather Madneſs, put
ſome Check to his aſpiring Deſigns, <hi>viz.</hi> his Conteſts with the Pope
about his Franchizes at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Regalia</hi>'s of <hi>France;</hi> and by
the Extream on the other ſide, in his revoking the Edicts of <hi>Nants;</hi>
and his Dragooning and Reforming the Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi>
whereby he loſt innumerable of his Subjects, to the weakning of
his own Power, and that in double Proportion; for his Enemies
(as he made them) became ſo much the more numerous and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
for thoſe which became Exiles, being an induſtrious ſort of
People, had contributed highly to the Encreaſe of the Wealth of
<hi>France:</hi> ſo that now the Charge of the War muſt have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by thoſe he left; yet in this ſtate <hi>France</hi> alone, for above
ſix Years, made an offenſive and victorious War by Land againſt
<hi>Germany, Spain, Holland,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> and the Duke
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> tho all theſe were aſſiſted by the Power of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho <hi>England</hi> embraced their Deliverance by the King, <hi>Ireland</hi>
did not, nor was it their Intereſt; for why ſhould the <hi>Iriſh</hi> join
with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who would have no Trade with them againſt the
<hi>French,</hi> upon whom the <hi>Iriſh</hi> depended by their Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce?
And it's obſervable, That tho the <hi>French</hi> aſſiſted the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
above three Years in their Wars againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> yet it may be
a Queſtion, Whether the <hi>French</hi> did not gain more by their Trade
with <hi>Ireland</hi> for Wools, Tallow, Raw Hides, and Proviſions for
their Fleet, than their Expence for carrying on the War againſt
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did amount to; whereas the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in the War, were
at a foreign Expence; and being a Naval War, were forced to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
their Fleets at one third greater Expence than the <hi>French</hi>
could do from <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="658" facs="tcp:60932:336"/>
Another Advantage the <hi>French</hi> had over the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
War, was, that <hi>Brest</hi> lying South of <hi>Ireland,</hi> every Wind, not
North, in one Courſe carries their Fleet to <hi>Ireland;</hi> whereas <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi>
from whence the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſent their Fleet to oppoſe them,
lies fivefold more remote from <hi>Ireland</hi> than <hi>Brest</hi> does: nor can
the Ships from <hi>Chatham</hi> be carried to <hi>Ireland,</hi> but by different
Winds, and ſteering different Courſes, almoſt from all the Points
of the Compaſs; for it muſt be (after the Ships are come within
the <hi>Buoy</hi> of the <hi>Nore)</hi> a South or South-weſt Wind to carry them
to the <hi>Buoy</hi> of the <hi>Gunfleet,</hi> before they turn into the <hi>Deep Waters;</hi>
then a quite contrary Wind brings them into the <hi>Downs</hi> and <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel;</hi>
and when they have ſailed above a hundred Leagues, another
Wind carries them to <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence it was principally, that the <hi>French</hi> for above three
Years together (ſo long as the War laſted) ſent out their Fleets
upon the Coaſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> did their Buſineſs, and returned to
<hi>Brest,</hi> before we could get out our Fleets to oppoſe them. Yet
<hi>Falmouth</hi> and <hi>Milford-Haven</hi> are much better Ports, and lie bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and more conveniently than <hi>Breſt; Milford</hi> much more to have
relieved <hi>Ireland,</hi> and oppoſe the <hi>French</hi> Deſigns at <hi>Brest;</hi> yet from
neither did we ſend one Ship to do it.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe if the Reaſon hereof be asked, it will be anſwered,
That there were no Docks, Shipwrights, or Naval Stores in either,
to have ſupplied our Men of War in thoſe Ports. But from whence
comes this to paſs? There were two Reaſons hereof, from within,
and from without; from within, <hi>Foy</hi> and <hi>Haverford-Weſt</hi> (and the
Port Towns generally of <hi>England)</hi> are Corporations, and the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
poor, yet proud of their Prerogatives, in excluding the
reſt of the Nation, and ſo have ſo much leſs means for building
Ships, Docks, or carrying on the Fiſhing, or any foreign Trades,
as the Inhabitants are fewer and poorer, and generally they are all
Beggars.</p>
               <p>The other Reaſon, from without, is the Act of Navigation againſt
Foreigners partaking equal Benent in Trade with the Natives of
<hi>England;</hi> ſo that tho God and Nature have endowed this Nation
with more excellent and noble Ports than any Nation in the World
of like Bigneſs (except <hi>Ireland)</hi> for the Benefit and Convenience
of the Nation, yet by the Iniquity and Folly of our Laws, we
have made them vain, and of no uſe to our ſelves, nor any other
Nation; whereas I am confident the <hi>French</hi> King would give any
of his new conquered Provinces in the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> to have
one ſuch Port as either <hi>Falmouth</hi> or <hi>Milford Haven,</hi> upon the
Coaſt of <hi>Normandy</hi> or <hi>Bretaign,</hi> within the Channel. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe Obſtacles, the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> is again reduced to
the Dominion of the Kingdom of <hi>England:</hi> But, I ſay, tho we
ſhould deſtroy the <hi>French</hi> Fleet of War, yet if we do not redreſs
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:60932:336"/>
the Oppreſſions which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in their Trades and Navigation
lie under, the Nation will be no ways ſecured from the growing
Greatneſs of either <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dutch;</hi> for the ſame Cauſes will have
the ſame Effects.</p>

               <p>WE have epitomized the Cauſes of the declining of the

that they may be more obvious to the Reader than if he ſhould

and I am conſcious to my ſelf of the Difficulties I labour under in
theſe Expedients: For a Reformation of State Affairs cannot be
made, but to the Hinderance of many particular Men, whoſe Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
it may be, has placed them in their Stations; theſe are
known, and by theſe I am ſure to meet with all poſſible Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
whereas in contending for the Benefit and Security of the
Nation, every body's Buſineſs is no body's Buſineſs, and not one
in ten thouſand will concern themſelves in it: however, Truth is
ſacred, and a divine Air attends it, and what is neglected in the
preſent time may prevail in ſucceeding Generations. And I will
beg but one thing of my Opponents, <hi>viz.</hi> That they will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
me by Clamour, but by Reaſon, and not Reaſon in Extremes;
for thereby we ſhall differ and wrangle in the Means without end:
and let this ſtand for a Maxim, <hi>That the Publick, in all Buſineſs of
this Concern, is to be preferred before the Private, and the Safety of
the Nation before any Man's particular Intereſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Security of every Country depends upon the Strength of
one Country againſt another, in caſe of War between them; and
herein Countries are to be conſidered as they are placed in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to each other: The Bounds of <hi>Inland</hi> and <hi>Mediterranean</hi>
Countries, are Rivers, Lines, and Forts, which are eſteemed ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred;
and a Violence done to them, is eſteemed a juſt Cauſe of
War; and ſo long as theſe are preſerved, the Countries within
are ſecured from foreign Wars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Britain</hi> is an Iſland which knows no Bounds but the Ocean, and
the Kings of it are Soveraigns of thoſe Seas which beat upon the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Shores; and in preſerving this Soveraignty, <hi>Britain</hi> is more
ſecure from foreign Invaſion than any other Kingdom in the
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:60932:337"/>
World (how great ſoever) which is on the <hi>Terrene</hi> Continent.</p>
               <p>But this Dominion hath been of late diſputed by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and
is at preſent by the <hi>French;</hi> nor ſhall the King of <hi>Britain</hi> be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
of the Soveraignty longer than he is able to defend it againſt
the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> whereas at preſent the <hi>French</hi> contend for
this Soveraignty againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in Conjunction with the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
But ſuppoſe by an Accident of the Times, in theſe Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the <hi>French</hi> had joined the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as they did in the firſt <hi>Dutch</hi>
War in King <hi>Charles</hi> II's Time, not 30 Years ſince, what a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
had theſe Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
been in? And I ſay, the King of <hi>England</hi> ſhall never be able to
maintain the Dominion of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas, and thereby ſecure
the Safety of the Nation, unleſs he be able to defend it againſt
the <hi>French</hi> in Conjunction with the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I'm a Lover of Mathematical Learning, becauſe it premiſes its
Principles before Men begin to learn or reaſon from them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
otherwiſe, where Men begin Diſputing, they proceed and end
in Contention and Wrangling: and, I ſay, that Trade is a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to Navigation, but above all, the Fiſhing Trades; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as you encreaſe your Trades, ſo you may infinitely encreaſe
your Navigation: and as Trade is a Principle to Navigation, ſo is
Navigation a Principle to maintain the Dominion of the Seas;
and therefore ſo much as the Trades of <hi>England</hi> be leſſened, ſo
much will the King be leſs able to maintain the Dominion of the
Seas upon the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> and this will be in
a double proportion; for ſo much as we loſe in either, the <hi>French</hi>

for the Employment of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Natives, Foreigners continue
to be excluded from our <hi>American</hi> Plantations: and herein neither
<hi>French</hi> nor <hi>Dutch</hi> have any Reaſon to complain; for the <hi>Dutch</hi> do
the ſame in their <hi>Spice Trade,</hi> and ſo do both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> in
their <hi>African</hi> and <hi>American</hi> Plantations: but herein it's not fit for
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:60932:337"/>
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to be reſtrained to <hi>Engliſh</hi>-built Ships, as well for the
Inconveniences which have been ſhewed before, as for that we may
want <hi>Engliſh</hi> Timber for this and our other navigating Trades, and
the King for building and repairing his Navy Royal, wherein our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Men of War, built of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Timber, excel all other,
being more tough, and leſs liable to ſplinter, whereby the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Men of War, built of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Timber, will endure a Battery, which
Ships built of foreign Timber will not.</p>
                  <p>2. That the home-vent of our <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and <hi>Sunderland</hi> Trades
in times of Peace, be driven by the Natives of <hi>England,</hi> excluſive
to Foreigners; as alſo our other Trades, from Port to Port in
<hi>England,</hi> and alſo to <hi>Ireland;</hi> tho theſe be impoveriſhing Trades
to the Nation: for the Pitch, Tar, Maſts, Cordage and Sails, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
uſed in theſe Trades, are foreign Commodities to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and for acquiring which, we return very little of our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures;
and the digging the Coals out of the Pits, and burning
them in <hi>London,</hi> and other Places, no ways enriches the Nation to
ſupply the foreign Expence for Pitch, Tar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> uſed in them;
nor are either old Men, Women, or Children, employed in theſe
Trades, but only young and luſty Men, and that but half the
Year: ſo that <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> and other Coaſt-Towns, which depended
upon theſe Trades, are almoſt quite unpeopled, by reaſon the reſt
of the Inhabitants find no Employment in them. However, I'm
confident that this <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and <hi>Home-Trade,</hi> and that to our
<hi>American</hi> Plantations, employ above four fifths of all the Ships in
all the Trades we drive by Navigation; and therefore we'll take
care to keep theſe, by excluding Foreigners out of them in times
of Peace: and unleſs Foreigners beat us out of theſe Trades, they
cannot get them from us.</p>
                  <p>For ought I know, the <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and <hi>Sunderland</hi> Trades are
better carried on in <hi>Engliſh</hi>-built Ships than foreign, becauſe Coals
being a bulky Commodity, and lying looſe in the Hold of the
Ships, in ſtormy Weather and rolling Seas batter the ſides of the
Ships; and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Timber being tougher than the foreign, it
better endures this than thoſe foreign built: but it were Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
for any to ſay, becauſe of one Convenience no other Ships
ſhall be employed in this Trade; for hereby the King may want
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Timber to build and repair his Men of War: beſides, all
Arts and Sciences are infinitely progreſſive; and if the means for
carrying on Arts be reſtrained or denied, this will not only cramp
the Improvement of this Art, but make the preſent Performance of
it more difficult; and no Man that is leſs converſant in any Art or
Buſineſs, underſtands how to manage them ſo well as thoſe Men
who make it their Buſineſs, and are more converſant in them.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore extream Arrogance and Injuſtice in any one, to
preſcribe to another, how, and by what means, he ſhall manage his
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:60932:338"/>
Buſineſs, and by no other: every Man in his Profeſſion ought to
uſe ſuch juſt means for carrying on his Buſineſs as he ſhall find moſt
convenient, and not be reſtrained to ſuch means as another ſhall
impoſe upon him; and therefore whatever my Opinion, or any
Man's elſe be of carrying on the <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> Trade in <hi>Engliſh</hi> built
Ships, yet it's not fit to impoſe it ſo upon others Negatively, that
they ſhall uſe no others, Trade and all Arts flouriſhing moſt
where they are more free, and have more means to improve them:
and tho I believe our <hi>Turkey</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Trades are better carried
on in <hi>Engliſh</hi> built Ships than others, becauſe they being more
Warlike, and double better Mann'd than Foreign, they will fight
their Paſſage againſt the <hi>Algerin, Tunis</hi> and <hi>Tripoli</hi> Pirates, when
other Foreign Veſſels eaſily become a Prey to them; yet I think it
unjuſt to forbid the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to trade in any other Ships into the
<hi>Straits.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> All Men by the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> are obliged to get their
Livings by honeſt Callings, and to be helpful to other Men; and
Humane Laws ought to aid the Law of Nature herein, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
thoſe who hinder Men from their Labour and Imployment;
and whenever Humane Laws are contrary to the Law of Nature,
the Execution of them is practiſing Iniquity by a Law: If a
Man has been bound Apprentice ſeven Years to any Profeſſion, it
may be he has thereby a Benefit above another not bound ſeven
years; but ſhall this other therefore not ſubſiſt, or be of any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
to the Nation, becauſe that was bound Apprentice? This is
ſuch a Topick in Reaſoning, as I never deſire to be converſant in.</p>
                  <p>But why muſt being bound Apprentice ſeven Years entitle a
Man to a Freedom of working in any Art or Myſtery? Suppoſe
one is bound, and is a Block-head, and another more ingenious in
it not ſo bound, is there any Reaſon that ſhall be free, and this
other not imployed? I am aſſur'd it is otherwiſe in <hi>Holland,</hi> where
Men in purchaſing their Freedom are not queſtioned how long
they have been bound Apprentice, but how well they can work in
any Art or Myſtery.</p>

                     <pb n="664" facs="tcp:60932:339"/>
I agree there are ſome Profeſſions which depend chiefly upon
bodily Labour, as <hi>Black-ſmiths, Carpenters, Shipwrights, Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
&amp;c. which cannot be well acquired but by being bound Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices
to them for ſome Time or Years; but I ſee no reaſon
why in others which do not ſo much depend upon bodily Labour,
Youth ſhould be bound Apprentice at all, but may be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
without it: for as in all ſcientifical Learning, Youth bred
up together will better be inſtructed in Company, and learn by one
another, than where one ſingle Youth is inſtructed by one Man;
ſo in the Arts of <hi>Combing, Spinning, Weaving</hi> and <hi>Knitting</hi> in Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Manufactures, and <hi>Silkthrowing, Weaving,</hi> and in many others,
Youth will be much better inſtructed in Conſort and Company,
than when alone.</p>
                  <p>There is one Mr. <hi>Robert Cooke,</hi> who is a more rigid <hi>Pythagorean</hi>
than any (I think) of the Antients, for he will not drink any thing
but Water, nor eat any thing which had Senſitive Life; nay, he
will not wear any thing which came of any living Senſitive Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but his Hat, Clothes, Shooes and Stockings, are all made of
Linen, and ſo is the Bed he lies in.</p>
                  <p>After the Natives of <hi>Ireland,</hi> upon the Act againſt importing
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattle, had converted their feeding Grounds of great Cattle
into Sheep-folds, and the Wools of <hi>Ireland</hi> being generally better
for Woollen Manufactures (as he told me) than thoſe in <hi>England;</hi>
this Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> ſet up a Woollen Manufacture in the County (as I
remember) of <hi>Wexford,</hi> wherein he ſet on work either 40 or 80
Looms, and I think each Loom imployed ten poor Children in ſort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
combing and ſpinning of Wool; and would entertain none but
poor married People and their Children in working, for whom he
firſt provided a Habitation, and all ſorts of Inſtruments for their
Work, and Materials to work on; they needed no great Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
how to work, but were inſtructed by one another in Conſort,
till they had learnt how to comb and ſpin; and in working in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
as they could improve themſelves, ſo he preferred them. I
asked him why he took only poor People and their Children? he
told me, <hi>Becauſe he was ſure of them when he had moſt Benefit of
them, whereas if he took young ſingle People which lived of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they would leave him when they could ſubſiſt without him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereby Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> holding Correſpondence with Merchants in
<hi>Holland</hi> for theſe Woollen Cloths, acquired great Riches; and a
little before (I think the Year before) the Revolution of <hi>England,</hi>
was made Sheriff of the County (I think) of <hi>Wexford:</hi> but being
zealous againſt the Superſtition of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon King <hi>James</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> and would have
ſet up his Trade in <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> if the Town would have permitted
him, tho <hi>Ipſwich</hi> be ſcarce half inhabited, which they would not;
ſo he ſet up ſome Looms without the Town: but he told me, he
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:60932:339"/>
could not get any Children to work, tho he proffered them a Penny
in a Shilling more than was given either at <hi>Colcheſter</hi> or <hi>Norwich.</hi> I
never ſaw him but once, and this was four Years ſince, and now I
hear he is returned back to <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But admit binding of Apprentices were neceſſary in learning of
Arts or Myſteries, I would fain know what is the Art and Myſtery
of Wholeſale or Retail Traders, or of Vintners, that Youth ſhould
be bound Apprentice to them, or of what uſe are they to the
Publick, but an unneceſſary ſort of People? And becauſe theſe are
bound Apprentice, which noways contributes to the Benefit of the
Publick, therefore other People which do, ſhall reap no Benefit of
their Labours, becauſe theſe labour not at all.</p>

and <hi>Lieſland</hi> for Pitch, Tar, Maſts, Raff, Boards, Timber, and

to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> which at a moderate Eſtimate amounts to a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
Sterling yearly; and we have little to ſupply for theſe, but by
our Trade to <hi>Spain</hi> for Woollen Manufactures, which if we loſe,
the Nation could not ſupport the Foreign Expence in theſe.</p>
                  <p>Now let's ſee the State of our Woollen Manufactures in <hi>England,</hi>
compared with that in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in caſe Foreigners be permitted to
trade into <hi>Ireland</hi> for them. In <hi>England</hi> the Wools of moſt of the
Counties on this ſide <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> are brought by a Land-Carriage
to <hi>Norwich</hi> and <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> to be manufactured there, and after that
by another Land-Carriage brought up to <hi>London,</hi> as generally your
<hi>Weſtern</hi> Cloths are, where only the Free-men of <hi>London</hi> muſt buy
them at their own Prices; and then in Foreign Vent they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
by the Act of Navigation to Ships doubly as dear built,
and ſailed with near double the Hands Foreign Ships of like Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
are; and all the Weſtern Cloths in their Vent to <hi>Spain, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,
Italy</hi> and <hi>Turkey,</hi> by a much longer Voyage, than if they had
been exported from any of their Ports.</p>
                  <p>Whereas <hi>Ireland</hi> is ſeated better than <hi>England</hi> for the Trades of
<hi>France, Spain, Portugal, Italy</hi> and <hi>Turkey,</hi> and the Ports equally
good, or better than thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> I'm ſure much better than
from <hi>London:</hi> The <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſhall have no need to carry the Wools of
<hi>Leinſter</hi> and <hi>Munſter</hi> to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> by a Land-Carriage; and when they
are wrought there, to bring the Cloths to <hi>Dublin</hi> by another,
where none muſt buy them but the Free-men at their own Rates,
and theſe bound to vend them in double as dear-built Ships, and
ſailed with near double the Hands of other Nations: but if Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
be permitted to trade, they may have the Cloths from the
next Ports where they are wrought, and where the Artificers can
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:60932:340"/>
live much cheaper than in <hi>England.</hi> The ſame Reaſon will be to
the prejudice of our Leather made of Hides, Calves and Sheep-skins
in our Foreign Vent; and if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> want Artificers, you
need not fear the <hi>Dutch</hi> will furniſh them: and at this rate, how

Fiſhing upon the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> what does this
hinder them in building Ships for our other Trades? nor does this
hinder the Imployment of Mariners in them, for we have imployed
none in it theſe 30 Years: So that this Trade is like a great Man
that is Lord of a great Lake, out of which his Neighbours grow
rich and powerful by the Fiſh they take out of his Lake; but this
Man is ſo in love with his Family, that he will not permit any of
them to fiſh but by ſuch Means or Inſtruments, as others of his

                  <p>In the <hi>New-found-land</hi> Fiſhery the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do, and always did

I ſay it was abſurd, for it ſets the Cart before the Horſe,
for Trade is a Principle to Navigation, and Navigation a Mean in
carrying on Trade; ſo that as you encreaſe your Trades, you
may your Navigation, if your Hands be not bound up from it:
but if you begin at Navigation, and tie your ſelves only to one
ſort of Ships, it will be impoſſible to encreaſe your Trades beyond
it, whereby all thoſe Peoples Labours which are reſtrained to this

                  <p>I ſay, this Reſtraint is as impolitick, as abſurd and unjuſt; for
hereby you ſacrifice not only the Navigation, upon which the

hath ſo waſted the Timber of <hi>England,</hi> that in convenient Diſtances
for building, the King will not find Timber in <hi>England</hi> to build and
repair his Navy Royal, if this Reſtraint be continued; and then in
what a Condition will the Nation be? I will give ſome particular
Inſtances hereof, which I know of my own Knowledg.</p>
                  <p>Having obſerved the Scarcity of Timber upon the Coaſt of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi>
(which I take to be the beſt of <hi>England</hi> for building Men of
War) cauſed by the Act of Navigation; about 20 Years ſince,
when I was at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> one Captain <hi>Baily</hi> was building the <hi>Oxford</hi>
Frigat; out of Curioſity I went to ſee it, and found the Captain
on Board; and falling into diſcourſe with him, among other things,
I told him how ſcarce Timber was in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> but I hoped it was
not ſo in the <hi>Weſt;</hi> he told me it was much leſs there than in the
<hi>Eaſt,</hi> and that he was forced to get Timber for building the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
from beyond <hi>Worceſter,</hi> which was above fifty Miles from the
Place, yet the Foreſt of <hi>Dean</hi> between, which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
called one of the Nurſeries of her Navy Royal.</p>
                  <p>About five Years ſince, one Captain <hi>Frame</hi> undertook to build
two Men of War for the King, and he bought Timber for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> near 20 Miles from <hi>Great Yarmouth,</hi>
from whence it was carried to <hi>Hull</hi> by Water to him: and I have
a Tenant in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who contracted about three Years ſince with
Timber-Maſters to be paid Sixteen Shillings a Load, or Tun, for
carrying of the Timber for the Dock at <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> to build their Ships,
which is, I am confident, more than the <hi>Dutch</hi> pay for their Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
delivered at their Docks down the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Maes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection.</hi> But if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> buy Ships for the Foreign Vent of

of Imployment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> So here the Intereſt of Ship-Carpenters is oppoſed to
the Intereſt and Safety of the Nation; but if theſe built Ships as
good and convenient as other Nations, the Merchants would not
look further: but is there any reaſon becauſe they cannot do it,
the Nation muſt be undone? let them continue building Ships
for <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> ſtill, and they know no better; yet this is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
that though our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Builders in this Trade have had a

Skill in it, and being too wiſe to be inſtructed, at laſt about ſix
Years ſince they found out, that it was better to build them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
longer; yet theſe are the Artiſts our Merchants muſt truſt to,
and no other. I am confident that the <hi>French</hi> King underſtands
the Advantages <hi>France</hi> reaps by the Act of Navigation, and that

                  <p>That the foreign Vent of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures, and the
Product of our Plantations, be as free to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in all Trades,

                  </p>
                  <p>When any Man ſhall give a rational Anſwer to any of thoſe
manifold Reaſons given by 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 6. for the Freedom of Trade to
<hi>Spain,</hi> &amp;c. I will recant all which hath been ſaid in any of theſe
Expedients; or that there are not the ſame Reaſons for the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in venting our Manufactures and Product of
our Plantations in all our foreign Trades, as well as to <hi>Spain,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
to <hi>Holland,</hi> who by the Cheapneſs of their Navigation may
vend them again cheaper in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> all the Countries and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
within the <hi>Sound,</hi> and alſo to <hi>Spain, Portugal, Italy</hi> and <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,</hi>
than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> can by their Navigation; but this is yet but
problematically ſaid, not granted: But in caſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
were as free and eaſy as it is in <hi>Holland,</hi> then the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
would be at an End.</p>
                  <p>I do not ſpeak this againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> trading in Conſort or
Companies, for I know many Trades may be better carried on in
Companies than by particular Men, but againſt the Uſurpation
and Tyranny of Companies, who becauſe they trade, therefore no
other <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhall; and this I ſay, that if Companies, as the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key</hi>
Company (which of all others is leaſt liable to Exception)
carry on their Trades beſt for the Intereſt of the Nation, no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Merchant could ſet up in competition with them; but if they
leave Room enough for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> to trade
to <hi>Turkey</hi> with their Woollen Manufactures, why ſhould any <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Merchant not of the <hi>Turkey</hi> Company be excluded herein, yet
theſe Trades free to other Nations? The <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company by
their Charter claim a Liberty of Trade excluſive to the reſt of the
Nation, from the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> to the North of <hi>China;</hi>
which if you take in both ſides of the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and Gulph of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi>
and the Circuits of the Iſlands between the Cape of <hi>Good Hope</hi>
and the North of <hi>China,</hi> is above half the Circumference of the
Earth: So do the <hi>African</hi> Company from the Kingdom of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco,</hi>
to the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> which if you take the Coaſt of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi>
as it lies, is more than a Quadrant of the Circumference of the
Earth; ſo that theſe two Companies claim a Trade excluſive to the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> of above 3/4 of the Circumference of the Globe of the
Earth; and if they had Power as great as their Claim, they might
give Laws to all the Princes of the World, as well as their poor
fellow Subjects; and it may be a Queſtion whether they would
uſe them better. And is not the <hi>Hamburgh</hi> Company broke? And
have not the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-Country Company upon the matter loſt our
Trade into the <hi>Sound,</hi> which within theſe ſixty Years was the beſt
Trade the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had for Woollen Manufactures in the World?</p>

by the 4 <hi>Jac.</hi> 2. the additional Duties upon Tobaccos and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars
are paid by the firſt Buyers; and by charging the whole Cargo,
theſe are damned to a Conſumption here in <hi>England;</hi> and if you
did not, the King ſhall be paid for all that is conſumed. On the
contrary, I ſay, the King is more ſecured of his Duties hereby, than
if the whole Cargo be charged; for let the Penalty ſtand, that the
Merchant ſhall forfeit his Cargo if he make a falſe Entry, and
who then will run the danger, when he is like to get nothing by
it? whereas if the whole Cargo be charged, if a Merchant ſcapes
but once, he will be no loſer; if he be diſcovered the next time,
he runs his Goods.</p>

                  <p>That it be free to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to import Salt, Wines and Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in any Veſſels.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon of this is, becauſe our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navigation is ſo dear,
that the <hi>Dutch</hi> import theſe much cheaper than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> can,
and therefore can export them into other Countries cheaper;
whereby the <hi>Engliſh</hi> cannot ſo well compound their Fraight in

Veſſels, all the Manufactures of <hi>England</hi> might be vended from their
next Ports, and not by a tedious and chargeable Land-carriage
brought up to <hi>London,</hi> to be fraighted from thence. And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
the Nation has naturally above the <hi>Dutch</hi> herein, that as our
Woollen Manufactures are better than thoſe in <hi>Holland,</hi> and may
be cheaper than there, ſo we can compound Fraights with Lead
and Tin, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> have not, and can ballaſt the Ship with

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould freely import Salt, Wines and

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> What this again, and at large? So that unleſs you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
the Nation, you cry out, <hi>You are undone;</hi> but if you will do as
well as other Men, you need not complain, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would
imploy you before any other: But muſt the Nation be undone,
becauſe you are either ignorant, and will not, or have not means
to ſerve the Nation?</p>
                  <p>Now let us ſee how far theſe Men would be undone, if the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of Salt, Wines and Brandy were free for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in
any Veſſels. If Salt were freely imported, we ſhould be ſo much
better enabled to cure Fiſh in all our Fiſheries, and alſo in ſalting
Proviſions in all our Navigations, as well as the Navy Royal, upon
Occaſions; and be enabled to refine Salt ſo much cheaper, as
Salt imported is cheaper: And what are the Ship-Carpenters
hereby hindred? for they never built one Ship for this Trade, nor
know how to build any other way than for the <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> Trade,
which is free both to imploy their Shipping and Mariners; and
therefore neither would be undone, if the Trade to import Salt
by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were free to do it in any Veſſels.</p>
                  <p>For the Trade for <hi>French</hi> Wines, it is but three Months in the
Year, <hi>viz. October, November</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> and theſe the moſt
perillous of all the Year for Navigation, and in the moſt rude and
boiſterous Seas in the World, and the outward Vent to <hi>France</hi> no
ways proportionable, but leſs by the Returns of the Wines; and
what would be the Loſs to the Nation, if theſe Ships were not
thus endangered by this Voyage, or the Mariners not imployed
in it?</p>
                  <p>The Reaſons for the Import of <hi>Portugal, Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi>
Wines, are not the ſame with the <hi>French;</hi> but if it were lawful for
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to buy Ships for the foreign Vent of our Manufactures,
and the Product of our Plantations, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hereby might in
Return of their Trades, import Salt, Wines and Brandies cheaper
from thence than the <hi>Dutch</hi> can; and if theſe were free to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
and exported, I ſee no Reaſon why we might not reduce
the <hi>Dutch</hi> to as low a Trade to the <hi>Sound,</hi> and to <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> as they
were before the Year 1635, and in a great Meaſure recover the

                  <p>The Reaſon hereof is, that the Manufacturing of any Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities

the People, as the thing manufactured is more valuable than the
Principals; as it may be Wool, which is the Price but of one Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
if made into Cloth, may be of eight Shillings value, then
ſeven Shillings will be Advantage to the Nation, by Imployment of
the People; and if otherwiſe it were not wrought, theſe People
might be a Burden to it. And the dying of Woollen Cloths, and
ſilken Manufactures, is the beſt Imployment for our Midland
People, next the making of them; and by withdrawing half the
Duties upon dying Stuffs, we entitle the <hi>Dutch, Hamburgher</hi> and
<hi>French</hi> to dye Woollen Cloths and Silks cheaper than we can. The
ſame Reaſon is of withdrawing half the Duties upon unwrought
Sugars, for hereby the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> may refine them cheaper

poor People at home, in making Ropes, Sails, and Nets for it.</p>
                  <p>If ever theſe Fiſheries be retrieved, it will be with great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
and a Work of Time, conſidering the Poverty of the Coaſt-Towns
of <hi>England,</hi> and the Potency of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
us, who are poſſeſſed of them; and it is more difficult to
retrieve a loſt Game, than not to be able to play it before it be
loſt: yet this Benefit we have by it, that we have diſcovered how
we loſt our Game, and how the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> won theirs.</p>
                  <p>In the Fiſheries upon the Coaſt of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> beſides
the King's indubitable Right, whatever <hi>Grotius</hi> in his <hi>Mare Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>
ſays to the contrary, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> may take in freſh Water and
Proviſions, and dry their Nets upon the Shore, which the King
may forbid Foreigners to do in their Fiſheries, which may be of
great Advantage to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for the <hi>Dutch</hi> begin their Fiſheries
of <hi>White Herring</hi> upon the Coaſt of <hi>Schotland</hi> or <hi>Schetland,</hi> upon
the <hi>Riſing Grounds</hi> (as they call them) and follow that Fiſhery
four Months in the Year, before the <hi>Herrings</hi> come to the Coaſt
of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> where we begin ours, which Fiſhery we
enjoy no longer than while the <hi>Herrings</hi> paſs to the South of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk;</hi>
ſo as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> enjoy this Fiſhery but about a Fortnight or
three Weeks: and I am told, the <hi>Dutch</hi> in this Fiſhery are three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
more than the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> tho the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by Men of War, force
the <hi>Dutch</hi> to fiſh farther from the Coaſt than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do: yet
this Advantage the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have above the <hi>Dutch</hi> in this Fiſhery,
that they can cure <hi>Red Herrings,</hi> which the <hi>Dutch</hi> cannot, for
<hi>White Herrings</hi> cannot be cured into <hi>Red,</hi> but when new taken:
ſo that the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as ſoon as they take them, bring them to <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,
Leſtolf</hi> and <hi>Pakefield,</hi> where they make them <hi>Red;</hi> whereas
the <hi>Dutch</hi> fiſhing a Fortnight or three Weeks before they return
to their own Coaſts, the <hi>Herrings</hi> become too ſtale to be made <hi>Red.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the Employment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Natives in making Cordage,
Nets, and Sails, for the Fiſhing Trades, it's requiſite that Work-houſes
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:60932:345"/>
be erected in every Port-Town for poor Children to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in Spinning and making Nets; and that rough Hemp,
Flax, Pitch, and Tar, be bought at a publick Charge, and laid up
in publick Ware-houſes, and delivered to thoſe who work, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
Officers, ſo that theſe be not bought up by Wholeſale People,
and by them ſold to Retailers, to be ſold to poor working People.
Theſe publick Stores, tho they be renewed, yet there need be no
further Charge to the Corporation or Port after the firſt, becauſe
the firſt being paid out of the Labours of the working People, the
Profit may buy more.</p>
                  <p>I think it were fit an Account were given to the Juſtices of the
Peace of the next Diviſion, of every Port-Town, in their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
Seſſions, of the ſtate of the Stock of the Port, as well as the
poor People employed hereby.</p>
                  <p>And for encreaſe of Work-men in theſe Manufactures, it is fit
that all Vagabonds and wandring Perſons ſhould not be ſent back
to the places of their laſt Habitation, but to the Ports of <hi>England,</hi>
to work in them; for bunching Hemp, and winding Ropes, require
but little Skill beſides bodily Labour, and Spinning and making
Nets is ſoon taught: and that People which are puniſhed by
Whipping and Branding, and then let looſe, ſhould be puniſhed
with more than ordinary Labour in theſe, for ſome time, more or
leſs, as the nature of their Crimes are, inſtead of thoſe Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
So that tho our Timber be not ſo cheap and convenient
for building Veſſels for the Fiſhing Trade, yet when one is bought,
we may fit it up for the Fiſhing-Trade as cheap as the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and
cheaper than the <hi>French,</hi> and our deſolate Coaſt-Towns be ſo much
more peopled, as People ſhall be employed in making Ropes, Nets,
and Sails, for the Fiſhing-Trade.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh an Experiment were made of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hemp, cured
in running Streams, whether it would not take Tar, and endure a
Straint, and not break, as well as foreign: I am ſure, of my own
Knowledg, the Wretting and Curing it in running Streams will not
kill the Fiſh; and if for that time it makes the Water bitter, ſo
as Cattel will not drink it, Men, for as little Charge, may make
Pits for their Cattel to drink in them, as to cure their Hemp in
them: and if, by this means, our Hemp ſhould make as good
Cordage as foreign, I am ſure above 20000 Acres might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to planting Hemp in the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> the <hi>Fen-Lands</hi> in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire,</hi>
and manifold more in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which at preſent are of
little uſe to the Nation; and if Hemp and Flax could be cheaper
hereby than they are imported from <hi>Liefland</hi> and <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would ſave the foreign Expence. But if Hemp and Flax
ſhould be planted, it is fit they ſhould be exempted from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Tithes, for by it, it may be, foreign Hemp and Flax
might be cheaper imported. But then where ſhould People be
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:60932:346"/>
got to theſe? It muſt be by Foreigners or <hi>Scots.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Hereby you would undo the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not at all, for they have no Tithe-Hemp and Flax before
they be planted, and ſo the Church and Church-men cannot loſe
or be undone, in not having that they never had; and why ſhould
the Intereſt of twenty or thirty Men be preferred to that of the
Nation?</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe 10000 <hi>l. per An.</hi> ſhould be given for binding 2000 Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices
in the Fiſhing-Trade, and theſe, one with another, earn
20 <hi>l. per An.</hi> this would be 40000 <hi>l.</hi> a year Benefit to the Nation;
and in 10 years this would be 400000 <hi>l.</hi> Benefit to it. I would
know which way Money could otherways be better employed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> King, at his own Charge, erects Schools in all the
Sea-port Towns of <hi>France,</hi> to inſtruct Youth in Mathematicks in
the <hi>French</hi> Tongue <hi>gratis,</hi> and gives half Pay to all young luſty
<hi>French,</hi> for two Years, who will employ themſelves in the <hi>New-found-Land</hi>
Fiſhery: and is it not fit the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould give equal
or more Encouragement to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for carrying on our
Fiſheries?</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe a Tax were given for this end, that all ſuch Foreigners
as would bring in any Fiſhing-Veſſels into any of the Ports of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the Foreigner ſhould be paid the full Value of his Veſſel,
provided he laid out Money in purchaſing a Tenement or Land in
<hi>England,</hi> to ſecure him and his Intereſt in <hi>England.</hi> By this means
the Nation exports no Money, which it muſt do in buying a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Veſſel; the Houſe and Land we ſtill have, and gained a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
and Maſter and Family, which we had not before; whereby
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> may be inſtructed to cure <hi>White Herring</hi> and <hi>Cod-fiſh</hi> as

improved the Whale-Fiſhery, as much to their Benefit and Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
as our Loſs.</p>
                  <p>It will be neceſſary, if the Nation deſigns to ſet up a Fiſhery
from the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> that the Returns of Fiſh be imported
Cuſtom free; for otherwiſe it will be impoſſible to encreaſe the
Foreign Trade for Fiſhing beyond the Returns which ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
in <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not at all, for the King has none in any of theſe Trades,
ſo cannot loſe by Goods imported in Return of them; but I ſay,
the King will be a Gainer by the Exciſe of Beer, Brandies, and
Wines, in victualling Veſſels in this Trade; and by the Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of theſe, by theſe and their Families at home, which are

The Reaſon hereof is, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had better furniſh themſelves

thoſe as theſe.</p>
                  <p>I am ſure the Principals of building Veſſels in <hi>New-England,</hi> viz.
Timber, Maſts, Pitch, and Tar, may be cheaper had in <hi>New-England</hi>
than the <hi>Dutch</hi> can acquire theſe out of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi>
and little Iron need be uſed in building them, eſpecially if

                  <p>But this building Veſſels for the Fiſhing and other Trades in
<hi>New-England,</hi> muſt for ſome time be done by foreign Carpenters,
for our <hi>Engliſh</hi> know no other Modes in building but for the
<hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Trade; and theſe are the Ships which the Act of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
calls our <hi>Engliſh</hi>-built Ships, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are obliged
to trade in, in all their other as well as <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Trade.</p>
                  <p>If the Parliament ſhould give 2000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> for ſome time,
as five or ſix Years, to twenty Ship-Carpenters, which build Buſſes,
and other Veſſels in other Trades, to be paid above the Wages
given in <hi>Holland,</hi> to each one hundred Pounds a Year more; I do
not believe but that they may be had upon theſe Terms: and the
Inhabitants of <hi>New-England</hi> are an induſtrious and numerous Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

               <p>I Have done, and I do not know but that I am the firſt
that ever began a Work of this Nature; and I was the
rather induced to it, becauſe tho the Employment of People,
and the Freedom of Trade, be the two great Principles of the
flouriſhing and happy State of any Country, yet the Nobility,
Gentry, and Clergy, whoſe Intereſt it is to have theſe, make
it not their Buſineſs to underſtand them: and our Merchants,
who are as underſtanding a ſort of Men as any are in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Country, tho they underſtand that Freedom of Trade
and Employment of People be the greateſt Happineſs of any
Country, yet theſe (eſpecially thoſe who act in Companies
excluſive to the reſt of their Fellow-Subjects) underſtand it
to be their Intereſt in continuing the State of Affairs, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to Trade, as they now ſtand; for hereby they have
the Employment of the Natives in their own Power, to take
what they pleaſe off their Hands in foreign Trade, and at
their own Prizes (beyond which the Natives cannot be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the foreign Vent of our Manufactures) and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers

others ſeek their Subſiſtence (for all Creatures deſire to

our Manufactures, ſo the reſtraining the Import of foreign
Commodities to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants (eſpecially thoſe who
trade in Companies excluſive to their Fellow-Subjects) is not
leſs injurious than the Export of our Manufactures; for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Merchants impoſe what Rates they pleaſe upon our
poor Artificers, and thoſe which cannot come up to their
Terms muſt not be employed.</p>
               <p>Nor is it better in the Domeſtick Trades of our Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
for few Manufactures can be managed but in Towns,
and frequented Places, where the Workers may be aſſiſted by
others, and with thoſe things which they ſtand in need of
in their Employments; yet all our great and frequented
Towns in <hi>England</hi> are Corporations and Market Towns, which
exclude thouſands of Artificers out of them, for not being free
of them, or not having been bound Apprentices in them,
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:60932:348"/>
whilſt theſe Free-men, by the Prerogative of their Freedom,
impoſe what Rates they pleaſe upon the poor Artificers, and

who buy of them.</p>
               <p>He that begins any Work, labours under manifold more Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
and is more ſubject to Error than another who builds
upon his Foundation. This is my Caſe, and therefore am more
excuſable for the Frailties and Errors I may have committed
in this Deſign; but upon the Diſcovery of any, I promiſe to
