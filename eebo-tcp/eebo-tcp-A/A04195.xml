            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and to an innumerable company of Angels.</hi> What manner of vnion is betweene holy men and Angels, let it be defined by Angels themſelues, or at leaſt by men that are their conſorts in the bliſſefull viſion of God and of his Chriſt. The ſubiect of our inquirie, was and muſt be, <hi>That Church,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts onely of men, and of men conſidered in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, which they now haue by God, being made man. Now albeit ſuch men and Angels may bee in ſome reſpect truely ſaid one Societie; and <hi>though</hi> both may be comprehended vnder ſome generall notion (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vniuocall or Analogicall:) yet without all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they doe not vniuocally agree in thoſe attributes, by which the Church, in its prime and principall ſenſe, is vſually ſet forth in Scriptures. Wee cannot ſay that the Angels are of Chriſts <hi>fleſh</hi> and of his <hi>bones,</hi> as euery one is, that is a liue member of his true Church. Yea though <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, and all ſuch as had perfect vnion with them in holineſſe of doctrine, life, or diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, were after death, as well as liuing, liue mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the holy Catholique Church; yet had they not, whileſt they liued on earth, no not alwaies ſince they liued in bliſſe, ſuch perfect vnion, (for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at leaſt) with Chriſt, as the S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi>. haue which haue liued ſince Chriſts Incarnation, Paſſion, and Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſince which time the Patriarches and Prophets vnion with Chriſt, hath beene perfected.

And to this we anſwer, that each of theſe vnions in part reſemble it, all of them doe not fully expreſſe it; becauſe it is more reall, more firme and ſolid, than any vnion can be betwixt the parts of bodies, ciuill, artificial, or naturall. For this <hi>Church</hi> is a true and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all body, conſiſting of many parts, all really, (though myſtically and ſpiritually) vnited vnto one head; and by their reall vnion with one head, all are truely and really vnited amongſt themſelues. The vnion is wrought betweene both, by a power ſupernaturall, by a skill ſuper-artificiall, by a wiſedome infinitely ſurmounting the higheſt reach of humane policie. That this <hi>Church</hi> is a true bodie, the Apoſtle (who in his life time was a liue member of it, and (vnder Chriſt the head) a chiefe maſter builder for his skill, and yet withall a moſt painefull labourer in faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or ſquaring the parts or materials of this ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,) hath left regiſtred. <hi>I reioyce in my ſufferings for you, and fill vp that which is behinde of the affliction of Chriſt in my fleſh, for his body ſake which is the Church.</hi>

Now there is no vnion betwixt the parts of bodies artificiall, or made by hands, ſo firme and ſtrong, as the vnion betwixt the parts or materials of a Temple or ſtone building; no vnion againe betwixt the parts of the body naturall ſo perfect, as the vnion of life.

Secondly, the Lawes by which this one Kingdome is gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are more excellent in themſelues, and more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, then the Lawes of any other Common weale or Kingdome. Againe, the Lawes of this Kingdome be not onely the dictates of the eternall
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7910:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God (for ſo were the ceremoniall or iudiciall Lawes of the Iewes:) but more then thus, they are the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable copies or expreſſions of his immutable and moſt holy will; by whoſe due obſeruance the true members of this kingdome become like vnto him. Thirdly, the obligements or conformity of euery Citizen or ſubiect vnto theſe Lawes, are farre more ſtrict, than in any other Common weale or Kingdome: for of many priuiledges and gracious promiſes, which the Citizens of this Kingdome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy, it is not the leaſt, that their euerlaſting Lawgiuer and gouernor, vouchſafes to write his Lawes, not in tables of ſtone or pillars of braſſe, but in the hearts of them, that are to bee gouerned by them. Now what bond or vnion betwixt men can bee imagined ſo great as that, which the fundamentall Law of this Kingdome once written in the hearts of men, doth neceſſarily induce or effect, to wit, that euery one ſhould loue his Lord &amp; King aboue all, and loue his fellow Citizens as himſelfe. And the execution of this Law is the accompliſhment of the felicitie and proſperity of this Kingdome: who ſo hath once attained to this perfection, doth ioy as much in the good things which his fellow citizen poſſeſſeth, as in his owne good; ſo that the ioy of each one is the ioy of all, and the ioy of all, is the ioy of each one.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Againe, this Church or Kingdome of Chriſt herein hath the preheminence for vnity aboue all bodies naturall or artificiall, in that it is truly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſolubly one, not by vnity onely of the <hi>forme,</hi> or by the continued identity of the head, or of ſome or more of the principall members, but by true vnitie
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7910:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and indiuiduall identitie of euery integrall or mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall part once perfectly vnited to the whole. And albeit theſe parts before their vnion were Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneall &amp; moſt diſlike, yet after their vnion they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vniforme &amp; moſt homogeneall to each other. Though ſome were Scythians, others Iſraelites, or Arabians, though ſome were ſlaues, &amp; other Lords, yea Kings and Princes, ſome Lay-men, ſome Prieſts, ſome altogether illiterate, others learned, ſome old, ſome yong: yet all of them vpon their admiſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Church or Common weale, become a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all generation, Kings and Prieſts. The leaſt, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, or loweſt member of this <hi>vniuerſall</hi> Church, or houſe of God, is himſelfe a <hi>Temple</hi> of God. Thus the vniuerſality doth no way impeach, it doth rather ſet forth and commend the vnity of this Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 That which giues this Church or Kingdome preheminence for <hi>vnitie</hi> doth giue it likewiſe prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence for <hi>holineſſe</hi> before al other Kingdomes or ſocieties whatſoever, and that is the participation of the ſpirit of Chriſt, or (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) the participation of the <hi>diuine nature,</hi> which wee haue through the operation of the ſpirit as agent, but which formally conſiſteth in, or immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulteth from that immediate vnion which we haue, through the ſpirits agency, with our Lord and King, who is both God and man.

Now euery thing in ſcripture is termed holy, that hath any ſpeciall reference to the producing of this temperature or quality of the ſoule, whether as a cauſe, meanes, or circumſtance. So we ſay the word preached is <hi>Holy,</hi> becauſe it is the ſeed or meanes of begetting this <hi>holineſſe,</hi> and

The reaſon why all muſt either dye or be changed, is, becauſe <hi>fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdome of heauen,</hi> and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this is, that fleſh and blood is not capable of that purity or conſummation of <hi>holineſſe:</hi> which is as the wedding garment, without which none may enter into thoſe Courts of the Temple, within which the mariage of the Lambe and his Spouſe be ſolemnized.

For all Gods promiſes to the Church principally belong to the principal members of it, who are diſtinctly and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidually knowne to himſelfe onely, not ſo to vs. To whom notwithſtanding their perſons are viſible, the profeſſion of their faith is likewiſe viſible. The ſinceritie of their hearts, or faith is to vs inuiſible, and therefore inuiſible it is to vs, whether they bee liue-members of the <hi>holy Catholike Church or no.</hi> If his meaning be, that many Indiuiduals which are no <hi>true</hi> liue-members of the myſticall body of Chriſt, be literally comprized vnder the name and title of the Church; the allegation, though moſt true, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry idle and impertinent. For thus the Iew is able to make proofe, as direct and full, as can bee required by any ingenuous and learned Chriſtian, that moſt of thoſe types and propheſies which we alledge to euince Ieſus the ſonne of <hi>Mary</hi> to be the Chriſt and promiſed Meſſias, are literally and hiſtorically meant and verified, either of the ſacrifice of the Law, or of Gods people; of <hi>Dauid,</hi> of <hi>Salomon,</hi> or of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. Al this notwithſtanding being granted, doth no way diſproue, but rather ratifie our application of the ſame propheſies or ſacred paſſages vnto Chriſt, of whom they are alwaies, in the intention of the holy Spirit, principally meant, and in whom alone
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7910:22"/>
they are exactly fulfilled, not onely according to the myſticall, but (for the moſt part) according to the moſt exquiſite literall ſenſe. Not that either all or moſt paſſages of Scriptures, which are firſt lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally verified of ſome other, and after exactly fulfil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led in Chriſt, haue (as ſome great Diuines thinke) two literall ſenſes (albeit this may ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, though very ſeldome) but that of one and the ſame litterall ſenſe, there may be, and vſually are, two or more obiects; one more principall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; the other, either leſſe principall, or leſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Thus it alwaies, not onely is, but of neceſſitie muſt be, whereſoeuer the tearmes, wherein it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Spirit of God to expreſſe himſelfe, containe in them a multiplicitie of ſignifications or importan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whether <hi>aequiuocal, analogicall,</hi> or <hi>ad vnum.</hi> Now of all tearmes vſed in Scripture, this word <hi>Church,</hi> as was obſerued before, hath the greateſt varietie of ſignifications or importances.

Anſwerable to this repreſentation, we ſay that all the glorious preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, titles, or promiſes, annexed to the Church in Scriptures, are in th firſt place, and principally meant of Chriſts liue-myſticall body. But being in abundant meaſure beſtowed on it, they deſcend by <hi>analogie</hi> or <hi>participation,</hi> vnto all and euery one, (that hath put on Chriſt by profeſſion) without reſpect of perſon, place, or dignitie.

The viſible Church in their language is a Societie or Body Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtique notoriouſly knowne by the ſite or place of its reſidence, or by their dignitie, order and offices, which are the perpetuall gouernours of it. <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bellarmine, eſt tam viſibilis quam eſt Regnum Galliae, aut Reſpublica Venetorum.</hi> And againe, that <hi>Church whereof Chriſt is King, is as viſible in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, by the preſence of his Vicar generall, as the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Naples in the abſence of the King, is by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Viceroy.</hi> Vnto the attributes or preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues beſtowed on the Church, in the Apoſtles or Nicene Creede, or vnto the promiſes annexed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it in the Scripture, the viſible Church, as we ſay, taken in the Romaniſts ſenſe, hath no claime or title, ſaue onely in reuerſion or by reflection: that is, The true myſticall body of Chriſt, is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtated in the bleſſings, prerogatiues, or promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made vnto the Church: from <hi>this Body,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Chriſt, which is the head of it, the ſaid bleſſings immediately and ſucceſſiuely deſcend in different meaſure vnto the ſeuerall members of it: or vnto ſuch as are no ſolid members of Chriſt in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice or conuerſation, yet true Catholiques in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſpeciall points which wee are in this article to beleeue, are theſe. Firſt, that as Chriſt, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt he liued on earth was a King, albeit his Kingdome was not earthly, nor of this world: ſo he hath ſtill a Kingdome, or at leaſt a great part of his Kingdome here on earth; the members or Citizens of which Kingdome, whileſt liuing in this world, are not of this world: their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (as our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeakes) is in heauen, that is, the Societie or Corporation, whereof they are actuall and liue-members, is tranſlated from earth to heauen, and their demeanour or conuerſation here on earth muſt be celeſtiall, and ſuch as becomes the ſonnes of God.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, that God or Chriſt in the choyce or admiſſion of Citizens into this celeſtiall Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth not tye himſelfe to any one Kingdome, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Prouince, to any viſible Societie or Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration here on earth. But as heauen it ſelfe is alike diſtant from euery part of the earth; ſo euery Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Kingdome of the earth are alike free to <hi>ſtand</hi> for, or ſolicite their election or admiſſion into this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7910:25"/>
heauenly ſocietie, which wee tearme the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church. Of theſe two branches of beliefe this third is a neceſſary conſequent, that God hath not beſtowed ſuch priuiledges vpon any viſible Church or Eccleſiaſticall Societie whatſoeuer vpon the face of the whole earth, as diuers Founders of Colledges in our Vniuerſities, haue done vpon ſome Grammer Schooles founded likewiſe by them. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haue beene choſen and admitted for perpetuall Fellowes of the celeſtiall Academie, which neuer were trained vp in the doctrine or diſcipline of the Grecian, Engliſh or Romiſh Church. God is the ſole Founder of the vniuerſall Church, and of euery particular true Church. As for particular viſible Churches, all are alike free, all their ſonnes alike ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of admiſſion into the holy Catholique Church; or if any ods there be, it is in the different meaſure of their obſeruance of the lawes preſcribed to all, eſpecially the Law of louing God aboue all in Chriſt, and of louing others as our ſelues for Chriſts ſake.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The laſt point is, that of all ſuch as are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, or authentiquely admitted into this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, none euer reuolt againe to the Synagogue of Satan or to the world. Their effectuall calling and ſolemne admiſſion, makes them ſuch pillars in the houſe of their God, that they cannot bee remoued; <hi>Him that ouercommeth, will I make a pillar in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of my God, and he ſhall goe no more out, and I will write vpon him the name of my God, and the name of the Citie of my God, which is new Ieruſalem, which commeth downe out of heauen from my God. And I
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7910:25"/>
will write vpon him my new Name,</hi> Rev. 3.12. So he had ſaid before, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Hee that overcommeth, the ſame ſhall be cloathed in white rayment, and I will not blot out his name out of the booke of life, but I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his name before my Father, and before his Angels.</hi> Wherein this victorie conſiſts, and how in this life it may be obtained, are points belonging to another Argument, and haue beene elſewhere diſcuſſed at large. That their names who thus ouercome, are whileſt they liue on earth, written in the booke of life, is euident out of the 20. <hi>chapter, ver.</hi> 12. <hi>the dead were iudged out of thoſe things which were written in the bookes, according to their workes.</hi> The difference betweene that part of Chriſts Church, which is tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, and that which is militant here on earth, may be reſembled by the eſtate of a viſible Societie or Corporation, of which the greater part or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall members liue at home in wealth, in peace and quietnes, whileſt others of the ſame ſocietie ſoiourn as Factors, or Apprentices in forraigne lands, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of their admiſſion to the ſame priuiledges which the other enioy, after they haue ſerued out their Apprentiſhip and performed all duties and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices required by the lawes of their Corporations.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Two queſtions, or rather two branches of one and the ſame queſtion yet remaine, which euery one that ſincerely mindeth matter of ſaluation, will often make with himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, whether every one that ſincerely profeſſeth beleife of this article of the <hi>Holy Catholike Church,</hi> be bound to beleeue, that he himſelfe is a true liue-member of the ſame Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:7910:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>The ſecond, whether euery one which profeſſeth this article, be bound to beleeue, that there is a true poſſibilitie left him by the founder of this Church or Kingdome, that hee may in good time become a true and liue-member of it.</p>
                  <p>Vnto the latter queſtion, my anſwer ſhall be out of the words of a woman to her husband diſtruſting Gods loue and fauor towards them, whoſe words became Canonicall Scripture; <hi>We ſhal ſurely die,</hi> ſaith <hi>Manoah</hi> vnto his wife, <hi>becauſe wee haue ſeene God. But his wife ſaid vnto him, If the Lord were pleaſed to kill vs, he would not haue receiued a burnt offring, and a meat offering at our hands, neither would hee haue ſhewed vs all theſe things, nor would at this time haue ſhewed vs ſuch things as theſe.</hi> Iudg. 13. verſ. 22, 23. All and euery one ought to bee aſſured that if the Lord had any purpoſe to exclude them from being liue-members of this <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> he would not ſo often, ſo louingly inuite them by the preaching of the Word, and exhibition of his holy Sacraments; all which he mightily prophanes, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer otherwiſe receiues them, then as vndoubted pledges of Gods loue and fauour vnto him in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 To the former queſtion, the anſwer is nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. All are not bound to beleeue that they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall or reall members of the Catholike <hi>Church.</hi> For none can truly beleeue thus much of himſelfe, but he that hath made his election ſure, and is certaine, <hi>that his name is written in the booke of life.</hi> Now though it be moſt true, that whoſoeuer is elect, was elected fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al eternity; whoſoeuer is reprobated, was
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7910:26"/>
reprobated from all eternity: yet will it not hence follow, that every man is at all times either in the abſolute ſtate of election and ſalvation, or in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſtate of reprobation and damnation. This is too deſperate a diuiſion, to put Nouices in faith vpon it, a cruell racke for tender conſciences. The beſt aduice which I can in this point giue, is that no man, eſpecially no nouice in faith, how ſtrong a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant ſoeuer he be, ſeeke to winde himſelfe into this Catholike Church, by ſtrength of ſyllogiſme, leſt Sathan thence take occaſion to wreſt his hopes out of his hands, by the ſame or like engine. The iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader is to take further notice that many ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſmes, which goe currant amongſt ſome good Diuines, haue many foule, though ſecret flawes, as hard to bee eſpied in this ſubiect of reprobation, election, and the like, as in any other, for theſe are hardly faſhioned into ſyllogiſticall forme. Many propoſitions are often in vulgar matters, taken for vniuerſall, when they are but indefinite. Firſt, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in a ſubiect wherin the fallacie is more groſſe and more eaſie to be diſcerned:
<q>
                        <l>Quicunque dicit Alexandrum fuiſſe animal ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſum, is verum dicit.</l>
                        <l>At quicunque dicit Alexandrum fuiſſe Bucephalum, dicit Alex <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap> Ergo,</l>
                        <l>Quicunque dicit Alexandrum fuiſſe Bucephalum, is verum dicit.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whoſoeuer ſaith <hi>Alexander</hi> the great was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous creature, ſaith true: but he that ſaith <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> was <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> ſaih <hi>Alexander</hi> was a generous
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7910:27"/>
creature: Therefore whoſoever ſaith <hi>Alexander</hi> was <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> ſaith true.</p>
                  <p>Others perhaps may anſwer otherwiſe; but the onely flaw in this Syllogiſme, if wee examine it by the rules of Art, is that the Major propoſition is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite, although it beare in front, a goodly ſhow of an vniuerſall note. But how large ſoeuer the <hi>note</hi> of <hi>vniuerſality</hi> be, vnleſſe it do <hi>plene afficere medium ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum,</hi> it leaues the propoſition as indefinite, as it found it. Now the <hi>medius terminus</hi> in the former ſyllogiſme is <hi>animal generoſum.</hi> And to make the former propoſition vniuerſall, the note of vniuerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould haue beene added to <hi>animal generoſum</hi>; as thus: <hi>Quicun<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> dicit Alexandrum fuiſſe animal quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis generoſum, is verum dicit. At qui dicit Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drum fuiſſe Bucephalum, dicit Alexandrum fuiſſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal quoddam generoſum.</hi> Here had beene <hi>dictum de omni, quodvis animal de quodam animali:</hi> the Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme for its <hi>forme</hi> had been true, but the major pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition had beene apparantly falſe; for <hi>Alexander</hi> was not euery generous creature, or a generous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of euery kind. The fallacie is the ſame though not ſo eaſily diſcerned in theſe two ſyllogiſmes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:
<q>
                        <l>Whoſoeuer mortifies the deedes of the body by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is certaine of life:</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>But</hi> I mortifie the deeds of the body by the ſpirit.</l>
                        <l>Therefore I am an actuall and liue-member of the holy Catholike Church; aſſured of ſalvation.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vniuerſall note [<hi>whoſoeuer</hi>] doth not <hi>plene af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficere medium terminum,</hi> which is <hi>mortification,</hi> which is in it ſelfe a terme indifinite, and hath many
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7910:27"/>
degrees or parts. To make the propoſition vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall or concludent, we ſhould ſay thus:
<q>
                        <l>Whoſoeuer doth in any ſort mortifie the deeds of the bodie, is a liue member of the Catholike Church:</l>
                        <l>But I doe in ſome ſort mortifie the deeds of the bodie:</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Ergo,</hi> I am a liue-member of the Catholike Church.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The forme of this ſyllogiſme is <hi>true,</hi> but now the Major is apparantly falſe, otherwiſe hee that would admit of this propoſition or concluſion in time of proſperitie, or in ſpeculations abſtracted from cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſins, paſt or preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the ſame party in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of actuall ſin or grieuous temptations would yeeld to the premiſſes and concluſion following:
<q>
                        <l>Whoſoeuer liues after the fleſh ſhall dye, and is vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excluded from being a liue-member of the holy and Catholike Church.</l>
                        <l>But I haue liued and doe liue after the fleſh: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>I am but dead and loſt, I ſhall neuer be a liue-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the holy and Catholike Church.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe two propoſitions, <hi>Whoſoeuer lines after the fleſh ſhall dye; whoſoeuer doth mortifie the deedes of the body by the ſpirit, ſhall liue</hi>; if we reſolue them right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are in value thus much:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>There is a degree or meaſure of mortification, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto whoſoever doth attaine, is forthwith tranſlated from death to life, and becomes a liue-member of the holy Catholike Church, a perpetuall Citizen of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem which is aboue without all danger of diſinfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>There is a degree or meaſure of fleſhly or carnall liuing, which who ſo doth in this life reach vnto, doth thereby without Gods extraordinarie mercy exclude
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7910:28"/>
himſelfe from the Communion of Saints, or ſociety of the holy Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that both propoſitions are vniuerſall in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the perſons, both indefinite in reſpect of the thing it ſelfe, to wit, <hi>mortification</hi> or <hi>carnall liuing.</hi> This degree or meaſure of mortification may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in this life. But who they bee, that haue attained to this perfect mortification, or when they attaine thereunto; muſt bee left to the iudgement of God, and information of their owne conſciences. The ſafeſt rule for rectification of our conſciences in this point, is that of Saint <hi>Peter: Brethren giue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to make your calling and election ſure.</hi> 2 Pet. chap. 1. verſ. 10. The meanes to make our electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſure are there at large preſcribed by him. The briefe or abſtract of it, is this; to follow thoſe practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which our conſcience enlightned by the light of Gods Word, ſhall approue. For a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is the mouth of the Spirit, and will one time or other ſpeake words of comfort to euery one that hath it, and ſeekes to keepe it. And one voluntarie teſtimonie of it grounded vpon experience or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of good thoughts, good deeds, or reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is worth a thouſand teſtimonies or confeſſions rackt from the ſpeculatiue vnderſtanding by force of Syllogiſme.</p>

                  <p n="6">6 Though the Church bee ſometimes by good Writers inſtiled as well <hi>inuiſible,</hi> as <hi>viſible</hi>; wee are not from this oppoſition of words or tearmes to conceit an oppoſition or diſtinction of Churches, as if ſome were viſible, others altogether inuiſible.

Ordinarily the liue-members of the <hi>Holy Catholike Church,</hi> or of that part of it which is to vs inuiſible, are members of ſome viſible Church, but not <hi>é con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra.</hi> For neither all nor moſt part of any viſible Church in latter ages, are true and liue-members of the Holy and Catholike Church, part of which wee beleeue to be here on earth, though it be to vs inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Finally, to be <hi>viſible</hi> or <hi>inuiſible,</hi> are denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations meerely accidentall, no true differences of the Church. Betweene a viſible Church, and a Church inuiſible, there is a meane. Many there bee, or may be in moſt ages, which are no members of the viſible Church, and yet better members of the

true Church, then the members of the Church vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the preſent are. For the true and orthodox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Church, might be truely viſible in its members ſo diſperſed and ſcattered, as they cannot rightly be ſaid to make one true viſible Church.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 The inuiſibilitie of the holy Catholike Church here militant on earth, hath not beene in all ages the ſame. The members of this diuiſion (if ſo it pleaſe any man to conceit it) were, in the Apoſtles time, in a manner, coincident. Few there were (eſpecially of the Iewiſh nation) which did aſſociate themſelues vnto the then viſible Church, which were not euen in this life aſſociated to the holy and Catholike Church militant, &amp; made liuing ſtones in the houſe of God. That ſaying of the holy Spirit, (<hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 47.) was more peculiarly verified of thoſe times, and of that people, then of any other times or people: <hi>The Lord added to the Church daily ſuch as ſhould bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</hi> This ſaying includes thus much, That all, or moſt of thoſe that profeſſed themſelues members of the then viſible Church, became liue-members of the holy Catholike Church. And no wonder, for the temptations or dangers, which then hindred the Iewes or Gentiles, but eſpecially the Iewes from conſociating themſelues to the then viſible Church, were more and greater, then ſuch as hinder the members of later viſible Churches, from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Kingdome of heauen, or from reſolute profeſſion of that doctrine, without which, no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of any viſible Church this day extant vpon earth, can enter or be admitted into that one, holy, and Catholike Church.</p>

The Apoſtle therefore expreſſeth his meaning not to be, that <hi>they ſhould not keepe company with the Fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with Idolaters; for then muſt ye needs goe out of the world.

                  <p>Concerning the firſt point, <hi>Whether there bee any Iudicature Eccleſiaſticke altogether the ſame with that which the Apoſtles had:</hi> I am not of opinion with <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that great Phyſition and good Diuine, that the exerciſe of Excommunication, was then onely needfull, when no viſible Church had any legall or ciuill remedie to preſerue its vnitie, or purge it ſelfe of groſſe offenders. Or that the right or power of Excommunication, which the Apoſtles and their immediate ſucceſſors had, did vtterly expire and vaniſh, after once whole Cities or Common weales became Chriſtian, and the Churches which before had onely ſoiourned amongſt them, were incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into them as liue principall members; enabled by full authority deriued from the ſupreame Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie or ſoueraigntie of States or Kingdomes, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict corporall puniſhment vpon offenders, to enact coerciue or penall Lawes or other meanes neceſſary for diffuſing the doctrine of life throughout the whole body politike, without lett or incumbrance of any particular part or member.

made it more then probable, that after the Churches and Common weales, were ſo mutually interwrapt and lincked together, that euery member of the Common weale was inforced to become a member of the Church, and to bee ſo admitted by Church Gouernours: the edge of the ſpirituall <note n="*" place="margin">Vide An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draeam Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentium in Libello de Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicatione.</note> ſword was much abated, the force of former ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ordinances became ſtifeled with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of perſons againſt whom they were directed.

                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:7910:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>The militant Church, ſaith the Author of the Antidote, <hi>is a ſociety or company of men, linked and combined together in the ſame profeſsion of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, and vſe of Sacraments vnder lawfull Paſtors, chiefly vnder one Head, and Vicar of Chriſt the Pope of Rome.</hi> the 3. part of the Antidote, cap. 1. p. 17. §. 5.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 The Church triumphant is more beholding to, or rather leſſe iniured by this Cardinall and his followers, then it was by ſome former Popes or Councels, which as the <note n="*" place="margin">Raynold in Theſ.</note> Doctor of famous and bleſſed memorie long ſince obſerued, haue made the Pope head of the Church triumphant. Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his Epitomiſts, in making the Pope ſuch an head of the vniuerſall Church militant, make him an eſſentiall head of all Chriſts actuall liue and indeficient members here on earth. And thus to doe, is an indignitie to Chriſt, not literally or fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſable by any tearmes which the tongue or pen of men can inuent. It may notwithſtanding, be thus typically repreſented or ſhadowed. Suppoſe a man ſhould put a <hi>Gorgon</hi> or <hi>Saracens</hi> head made of ſtraw or clouts, taken out of a ſinke, or ſome other place not fit to be named, vpon the Kings ſtatue or image made by publike authority, of pure gold, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing firſt ſtricken off, or ſtollen away the true head, which the Artificer had framed of matter homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall and correſpondent for forme or proportion to the reſt of the body.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 Contradictorie to Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the Author of the Antidotes definition, wee may for the preſent conclude, and the rules as well of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reaſon, as of lawes ſupernaturall and diuine,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7910:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will ratifie our concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, that ſince the Churches and Common-weales abſolutely diſtinct each from other, and independent one of another, haue beene thus wedded together as ſoule and body, as man and wife; there haue beene as many ſeuerall viſible Churches independent each on other, for matter of iuriſdiction or ſubiection to one viſible Head, as there be ſeuerall free States or Chriſtian Kingdomes independent one of another. Secondly, that the ſubordination of Church to Church, is in proportion the ſame, with the ſubordination of the ſeuerall ſtates, wherein the Churches are planted. The beſt vnion that can be expected betweene viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chuches ſeated in Kingdomes or Common-weales independent one of another, is the vnitie of league or friendſhip. And this may be as ſtrict as it ſhall pleaſe ſuch Common-weales, or Churches to make it. Thirdly, to make the Church ſeated in one abſolute State or Kingdome, liue in ſubiection to another Church ſeated in another Kingdome, or to any member of another Church or Kingdome (head or branch) is to erect a Babell, or ſeat for Antichriſt, not to build vp one holy Church to Chriſt. This pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice or vſurpation of the Romiſh Church, hath been the reaſon why the chriſtian world for theſe many yeeres, hath beene more confuſed and diſordered, then the Synagogue of Mahomet. Nor is there any poſſibilitie that chriſtian States or Kingdomes ſhould euer be ſo vnited in faith and loue, as that their ioynt prayers ſhould be acceptable vnto God againſt the Turke or other profeſſed enemie of Chriſt, vntill they haue caſt off this heauy yoke of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7910:39"/>
Satanicall ſlauery. But of theſe points hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 Laſtly, ſince the Church hath beene diffuſed throughout all and euery part of Kingdomes and Prouinces, it is impoſſible that euery member ſhould perſonally meete to make lawes and orders. And yet all lawes are preſumed to bee made by vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall conſent, and in this regard, the Churches haue beene inforced to haue as well <hi>Churches</hi> as <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> politike, <hi>repreſentatiue.</hi> And inaſmuch as the practice and cuſtome hath beene, to admit none but Cleargie or Church-men, as members of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Eccleſiaſtike or Church repreſentatiue: the name of the Church hath beene in a manner appropriated to the Cleargie, Church-men, or Spiritualtie.</p>
                  <p>The Church or body Eccleſiaſtike repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, that is, the Church inabled to make lawes or canons Eccleſiaſtike, (of what members ſoeuer, it doth, may or ought to conſiſt, for their qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as whether onely of Clarkes, or whether it may admit ſome mixture of the Layetie) is either perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently <hi>exiſtent,</hi> or <hi>exiſtent</hi> onely by viciſſitude or turnes.

neither <hi>Scholar,</hi> nor <hi>Maſter,</hi> nor <hi>Church</hi> viſible or repreſentatiue, can be any other then equiuocall or dead members of the true Church.

To the former obiection, the anſwer on our part is eaſie. For true faith receiues its infallibilitie, not from any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilitie in our immediate and ordinary teachers, but from the infallibility of the truths themſelues, which they propoſe vnto vs out of the <hi>rule</hi> of truth, and from the infallibilitie of that internall and ſecret Teacher, without whoſe impreſſions of truths infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in mens hearts, no true faith can bee conceiued by the Church it ſelfe in what ſenſe ſoever taken, or by any member of it. But this point likewiſe hath beene fully diſcuſſed throughout our ſecond booke vpon the Creed. Concerning this glorious title of <hi>not erring,</hi> wherewith he ſeekes to inveſt the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, the caſe is eaſie, and the iſſue ſhort.

For this time it ſhall ſuffice in a word to aduertiſe, that the old Teſtament and the new, are ſometimes compared and conſidered by ſacred Writers, <hi>tanquam includens &amp; incluſum,</hi> as the <hi>Huske</hi> and the <hi>Graine.</hi> The Goſpell before Chriſts time, was in the Law as the corne new ſet in the eare. And the Law and the Goſpell, or the two Teſtaments, thus conſidered, are rather one the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two, at leaſt there is an vnity of ſubordination betwixt them. Vnto ſuch as vſed the old Teſtament as they ought, onely as an Introduction to the new, there was indeed but one Teſtament. For, as the Schooles ſpeake, <hi>vbi vnum propter aliud, ibi vnum tantùm.</hi> The ſame Teſtaments may be ſometimes conſidered as abſtracted or ſeuered each from other. Thus the Goſpell or new Teſtament ſince our Sauiours death and reſurrection, is become as pure corne, threſhed and winnowed. The old Teſtament or the Law (thus ſeuered from it) remaines onely as the chaffe or huske. If we thus conſider the Law or old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Iewes imbrace it, that is, altogether ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the new, to which alone wee Chriſtians adhere by faith; they are not onely two, but two oppoſites or contraries. The Iewes <hi>appetitus cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> or <hi>womaniſh longing</hi> after the Law, and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant adherence to the Goſpell (thus oppoſed vnto
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7910:51"/>
the Law, as pure corne vnto the putrified chaffe or huske) breeds a kinde of Antipathie betweene vs. For ſuch as is our ſeuerall food and nouriſhment, ſuch our ſeuerall diſpoſitions are. Wee feed vpon the pure corne, or rather vpon the bread of life it ſelfe cleanſed from all branne; the Iew onely vpon the chaffe or huske; and his religion is as loathſome to vs, as ſwines fleſh is to him. See <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 This oppoſition or ſubordination betweene the legall or Euangelicall Teſtament will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare from our ſecond inſtance which was in the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14. <hi>If the blood of Bulls and of goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the vncleane, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh: How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternall Spirit, offered himſelfe without ſpot to God, purge your conſcience from dead workes to ſerue the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God.</hi> The <hi>termes</hi> of proportion likewiſe in this <hi>inference</hi> are <hi>foure.</hi> The firſt, not fully expreſſed but implyed, and it is a ſin or treſpaſſe meerly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the Law of ceremonies. The ſecond, which is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> to this, is a legall or proper ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſuch a ſinne, to wit, the <hi>blood of Bulls and of goats, and the ſprinkling of the aſhes of an Heifer.</hi> The third terme typified by the Ceremoniall <hi>ſinne,</hi> is mans naturall corruption, ſinnes originall or actuall, or ſinne of what kind ſoeuer committed againſt the morall Law of God. The fourth <hi>terme</hi> is the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by God appointed, to purifie and clenſe vs from ſuch ſinnes, and that was the bloody ſacrifice of our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt, whereof the legall ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7910:52"/>
were types or ſhadowes. So that the legall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices had two vſes or references, the one expiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (for their offring did expiate ſins meerly cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall:) the other <hi>ſacramentall</hi> or <hi>prefiguratiue,</hi> for they did picture out or repreſent the eternall ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, whereby our redemption was fully wrought, as the Apoſtle proues at large in the 10. chapter to the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> His argument in this place is in effect thus; The ſame <hi>efficacie</hi> which ſacrifices meerly legall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred by the Prieſt had in cleanſing men from ſinnes meerly ceremoniall [<hi>as from touching of the dead, or ſome creeping thing &amp;c.</hi>] the ſame, but much greater efficacy, hath the <hi>blood of Chriſt</hi> being offred by the eternall Spirit (that is, by the Godhead perſonally dwelling in him) to cleanſe vs from all ſinnes againſt the morall Law of God, and to purifie vs from ſuch dead workes, as, not expiated by his blood, would bring forth euerlaſting death. Now the Apoſtle takes it as granted, that the legall ſacrifices did not onely ſufficiently cleanſe men from ſuch ſinnes, but withall did legally ſanctifie them: and ſo in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Chriſts blood was not onely the full price of our redemption, but is withall the fountaine of our ſanctification, by which we are qualified for admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the heauenly Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The firſt originall of the Iewes hypocrifie and malice, was their ignorance in the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for they thought, theſe legall ſacrifices were ſufficient to clenſe them from all ſins whatſoeuer. And if ſuch ſacrifices could haue freed from ſinne, the Iew had beene moſt free from ſin, of any people liuing. Moſt of thoſe that preſecured our Sauiour Chriſt, might

for this function by the ſpirit of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> So much that place of S. <hi>Peter</hi> proueth in his 1. Epiſtle, 3. chapter, verſe 18, 19, 20. <hi>For Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for ſinnes, the iuſt for the vniuſt, that hee might bring vs to God, being put to death in the fleſh, but quickened by the Spirit. By which alſo he went, and preached vnto the ſpirits in priſon, which ſometime were diſobedient, when once the long-ſuffring of God waited in the dayes of Noah, while the Arke was a preparing.</hi> Yet <hi>Noah</hi> had but his portion, though a large one of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: <hi>ſed Chriſto Deus non admetitur ſpiritum, God giueth not the Spirit by meaſure to Chriſt, Ioh.</hi> 3. <hi>verſe</hi> 34. <hi>He ſpake but the word, and great was the number of Preachers,</hi> and from his inexhauſtible fulneſſe, wee <hi>all receiued grace for grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Againe, <hi>Noah</hi> built an <hi>Arke</hi> by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the ſafetie of all ſuch as were obedient to his preaching, into which, whoſoeuer would not enter, was deſtroyed by the Floud, for diſobedience to his preaching. All this was fulfilled of the Church, which Chriſt builded: for whoſoeuer doth not enter into it, ſhall be deuoured by the euerlaſting flames, for diſobedience to this authentique Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of righteouſneſſe. The iſſue then betweene vs and the Romaniſts is, vnto <hi>what Church Noahs Arke</hi> anſwers as a figure? to the viſible Romiſh Church, or onely to the Church before defined, which is one, Holy, and Catholike Church <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> Wee ſay of this later onely, not of any viſible Church, ſaue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo farre as it is an introduction to this Church. Our reaſon is this: Although it be true that none of the ſonnes of men, beſides ſuch as entred into <hi>Noahs</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:7910:54"/>
Arke, were ſaued from the deluge; yet is not this negatiue more vnqueſtionably true, then the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue; That whoſoeuer entred into the Arke, were ſaued from the deluge. This is ſo expreſly and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately ſet downe in the Scripture, that no Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt can queſtion the meaning or extent of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, wherein it is ſet downe. <hi>In the ſelfe ſame day,</hi> (ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. <hi>verſe</hi> 11.) <hi>entred Noah and Sem, and Ham, and Iapheth, the ſonnes of Noah, and Noahs wife, and the three wiues of his ſonnes with them, into the Arke.</hi> And in the 8. chap. and the 18. verſe. <hi>Noah went forth, and his ſonnes, and his wife, and his ſonnes wiues with him.</hi> So that eight ſoules came into the Arke, and eight went forth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 So then for concluſion, <hi>Noahs Arke</hi> was a type of that <hi>Church,</hi> into which whoſoeuer enters, ſhall be ſaued; but ſuch a Church is not the viſible Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church in what ſenſe ſoeuer it be taken. Firſt, it is not true of the vniuerſall Church conſiſting of the Layetie and Cleargie, nor of the Church repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatiue; to wit, their generall or prouinciall Councels. For none will affirme, that all and euery one of their Biſhops, or ſuch as giue ſuffrage in their Councels, ſhall haue the ſuffrage of Chriſt, or their names written in the booke of life. They will not <hi>aſtipulate,</hi> that whoſoeuer is graced with a red hat in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall bee ſure to weare a Saints or Martyrs crowne in heauen. Euen the Pope himſelfe, whom they make their <hi>vertuall Church,</hi> may bee a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vicious man, and dye the death of the wicked: and therefore neither liuing was the head, nor at his death any member of that Church, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7910:54"/>
by <hi>Noahs Arke</hi>; becauſe hee can neither ſaue himſelf, nor ſuch as haue committed their ſoules to bee wafted ouer to the new Ieruſalem, by this preſumed Pilot of <hi>Peters</hi> pretended ſhip. So that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Peters</hi> ſhip was not ſuch a type of Chriſts Church, as <hi>Noahs Arke</hi> was, or elſe the Pope is no Pilot of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Doe wee ſpeake this as men? doth not the Scripture ſay the ſame? doe wee make theſe colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as ſectaries, or hath not S. <hi>Peter</hi> made them vnto our hands? For, ſpeaking of the <hi>Arke, wherein few, that is, eight ſoules were ſaued by water</hi>; he ſaith, <hi>The like figure whereunto, euen baptiſme, doth alſo now ſaue vs, (not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God) by the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>cap. verſe</hi> 20, 21. His meaning is, that as <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke was the type of that Church <hi>extra quam nulla ſalus, intra quam ſalus certiſsima,</hi> out of which there is no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, in which ſaluation abounds: ſo the waters by which the Arke was conſecrated or hallowed to be the receptacle of ſafetie to mankinde, was a type or figure of that ſacred Lauer by which the Church is conſecrated or hallowed to bee as the wombe or breaſt of ſaluation to the faithfull. Baptiſme it ſelfe anſwereth in proportion to the doore or window of <hi>Noahs Arke.</hi> But of what baptiſme was the water, by which ſuch as entred into the Arke were ſaued, a type? A type of externall Baptiſme? No, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Baptiſme, and the waters of <hi>Noah,</hi> were types of the ſame <hi>ranke,</hi> both were types or ſhadowes of that internall Baptiſme, which is wrought by the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7910:55"/>
Holy Ghoſt, by which we are incorporated into the body of Chriſt, and become more vndoubtedly ſafe from the euerlaſting fire, then ſuch as entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, were from the deluge of water.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The Apoſtles argument, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. holds as truely of <hi>Chriſts Church,</hi> as of his <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> If the Arke which <hi>Noah</hi> built, did ſaue all ſuch from the deluge, as entred into it; how much more ſhall that <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> which Chriſt hath built, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by his moſt precious blood, giue life eternall to all ſuch as in this world become liue-members of it? Such members they are made, not by externall Baptiſme, or by becomming members of the viſible Church, but by internall grace or ſanctification. But neuer did the Iew doat halfe ſo much on externall circumciſion and legall ſacrifices, or the Aaronicall Prieſthood, as the moderne Romaniſt doth on the Sacraments of the Goſpell, and on his imaginarie Prieſthood after the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> or other like notes or ſenſible cognizances of the viſible Church. Now it were more then wonder, if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of this his blinde zeale vnto theſe externals, did not draw him to much greater, more direct diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trall oppoſition vnto Chriſt, vnto an higher pitch of inueterate malice againſt the members of his <hi>Holy Catholike Church,</hi> or Kingdome ſpirituall, then the high Prieſt or Elders exerciſed againſt his perſon, whileſt he was preſent in the fleſh. Thus much for this time of the allegorie or argument of proportion drawne from <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke.</p>
                  <p>As for the generall Maxime, <hi>extra Eccleſiam non eſt ſalus, [There is no ſaluation out of the Church,</hi>] al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

                  <p>In reſpect of the firſt ſort, that is, of all ſuch as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer were members of any viſible Church, the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime <hi>extra Eccleſiam non eſt ſalus, there is no ſaluation out of the Church</hi>; is not vniuerſally true: yea, taken vniuerſally, it is vniuerſally falſe in reſpect of time; that is, it could neuer be verified of all and euery one that was <hi>extra Eccleſiam viſibilem, out of the viſible Church</hi> in any age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:7910:56"/>There was a time, wherin Gods viſible Church was confined to one people or nation, to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now it were an hereſie to ſay, that no ſonnes of men, beſides the ſonnes of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> or ſuch as did aſſociate themſelues vnto the viſible Church then reſident onely in <hi>Abrahams</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, were ſaued: during the time of the Law, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law was giuen, righteous <hi>Iob</hi> was no ſonne of <hi>Iacob,</hi> yet the ſonne of God. And it were vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſſe, though no hereſie to ſay, that <hi>Iethro, Rechah,</hi> or <hi>Ionadab,</hi> were all ſonnes of perdition, or were ſonnes (as our Sauiour ſaid of the Iewes) of their father the Deuill; becauſe they were not the ſonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or had not the viſible Church of Iſrael for their mother.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect of this preſent time, to ſay, Wee know no meanes, by which any Inhabitant of <hi>China,</hi> or of <hi>Terra incognita</hi> can be ſaued, is a great deale more ſafe, then to thinke God hath no meanes vnknowne vnto vs, by which he may and doth ſaue ſome, euen in thoſe countries wherin there is no viſible Church or Chriſtian Congregation; or whoſe Inhabitants haue no commerce with any Chriſtians. Wee ſee by experience, that God teacheth ſuch as are borne deafe and dumb, many things by the eye or other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſuggeſtion, which ſuch as haue the vſe &amp; bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of eares &amp; tongue, could not learn either by ſight or other externall ſenſe.

and dumbe can be ſaued. The Apoſtles ſaying then, <hi>that faith commeth by hearing,</hi> muſt bee limited by its proper ſubiect; that is, men to whom God hath giuen the gift of hearing. So muſt the Maxime now in queſtion, <hi>extra Eccleſiam non eſt ſalus, out of the Church there is no ſaluation,</hi> bee limited or reſtrained to its proper ſubiect. Howbeit, the exact limitation of it might beſt bee made or taken by ſuch as haue occaſion to diſpute with the Iewes or Heathens. It is onely or eſpecially true, in reſpect of ſuch Iewes, Turkes, or heathens, and their ſeuerall progenies, as haue commerce with Chriſtians. The former Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime, with reference to ſuch men, is vniuerſally true; if we take the viſible Church vniuerſally or indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, vnleſſe ſuch men aſſociate themſelues to ſome viſible Church or other, they cannot be ſaued. And in ſome caſes it may be vndoubtedly true, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſome particular viſible Church; but ſo, true onely, <hi>ex accidenti,</hi> or <hi>hypotheſi, by accident or vpon ſuppoſition.</hi> As if a Iew or Mahumetan by profeſſion and birth, ſhould liue in this kingdome, hauing no poſſible meanes of aſſociating himſelfe to any other congregation of Chriſtians, than ſuch as conforme themſelues to the doctrine and diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> it were both ſafe and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe to lay the former Law or Goſpell as hard vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as the Papiſts doe vnto vs; to tell him in plaine and peremptory tearmes, that there were no meanes for him to eſcape the horrors of hell, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of the world to come; vnleſſe hee would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a member of Chriſts Church, planted here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs. Or in caſe he and other more, ſuch as he

                  <p n="4">4 From this truth, ſome excellent writers againſt the vſurped power of the Romiſh Church in the vſe or exerciſe of <hi>Peters</hi> keyes; ſome I ſay, aſwell before

                     <hi>Luthers</hi> time as ſince, haue gathered this generall doctrine; <hi>That the viſible Church hath only power to declare, who are ſeparated or excommunicated</hi> ipſo facto <hi>from the holy Catholike Church; ſhe hath no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ſo to ſeparate or excommunicate any</hi> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catione majori, <hi>by the greater excommunication, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they haue firſt excommunicated themſelues, or voided their hopes or intereſts in the holy Catholike Church, by hereticall poſitions, or opinions, or by lewd and ſcandalous miſdemeanours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this opinion was that famous <hi>Weſelius,</hi> which was intituled <hi>lux mundi</hi> before <hi>Luther</hi> aroſe, or the light of the Goſpell which we now enioy, did break forth. But though the doctrine be true, yet he and ſuch as follow him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> extend the truth of it a little too farre, and beyond its proper ſubiect. There is a meane betweene this opinion, and the contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame of the <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> which cannot be found out, without ſome diuiſion of ſuch errours, or other cauſes, as either iuſtly deſerue, or at leaſt may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to deſerue excommunication, or vtter ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the viſible Church.</p>
                  <p>Some errors in Diuinitie as we ſay, are <hi>hereſies ex ſpecie</hi>; of ſo deadly a nature, that they induce a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the <hi>Holy, Catholike Faith,</hi> euen in their very firſt degree. Of this ranke are all ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in Religion, as are directly oppoſite or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to thoſe fundamentall points, whoſe poſitiue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe is neceſſary to ſaluation; which he that beleeues not, is <hi>infidelis ſecundùm infidelitatem purae negatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> that is, ſuch an Infidell as they are, which cannot ſay the Lords Prayer, the Creed, or ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements

by heart, or know not the generall conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of them: and which peremptorily to deny, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict, doth argue <hi>infidelitatem prauae diſpoſitionis,</hi> an infidelitie of contradiction. We ſay in Logicke, <hi>Euery contrarietie</hi> if it be direct and full, doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily include a contradiction, as he that ſaith <hi>nix eſt alba, Snow is white</hi>; doth as fully contradict him that ſaith, <hi>nix eſt nigra, Snow is blacke,</hi> as hee that ſhould ſay, <hi>nix non eſt nigra, Snow is not blacke.</hi> For <hi>album eſſe, to be white,</hi> is ſomewhat more then <hi>non eſſe ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum, not to be blacke.</hi> The rule is applyable in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and of good vſe in this preſent argument.

If it be <hi>infidelitas purae negationis,</hi> an infidelitie priuatiue, not to beleeue the incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt (as certainly it is; for all ſuch as doe not beleeue it, are Infidells:) then to bee but poſitiuely perſwaded, that Chriſt is not truly man, is an errour <hi>ex ſpecie,</hi> hereticall, a deadly hereſie, <hi>infidelitas prauae diſpoſitionis,</hi> an infidelity of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety. Againe, if not to beleeue, the Sonne of God is truly God, or if not to beleeue, that this true Son of God was incarnate for vs, neceſſarily argue a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of life ſpirituall, and be, (as we ſay) <hi>infidelitas purae negationis, a priuatiue infidelity,</hi> then if any

man which acknowledgeth Chriſt, bee of opinion, that he is not as truly God as he is man, this man by entertaining ſuch an opinion, doth vndoubtedly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate and diſunite himſelfe from the holy bond of Catholike faith, and by conſequence ſtands excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> from the <hi>Holy, Catholike</hi> Church, and depriued of the communion of Saints; whether the viſible Church doth her duty or no, in depriuing him of all communion with her ſelfe, or with her members: yea, though the Paſtors or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors of the viſible Church could by bribery, or other ſiniſter reſpects be miſ-ſwayed, if not to abett or maintaine him in it, yet to vſe conniuence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.</p>
                  <p>Now of all ſuch errours as are <hi>ex ſpecie</hi> hereticall, and neceſſarily induce a ſeparation or diſunion from the holy, Catholike Faith or Church; the former aſſertion of <hi>Weſelius</hi> is true, to wit, <hi>That the viſible Church doth not by her authoritie cut them off from being members of the holy, catholike Church, but onely declare them to be no members of that Church.</hi> And of all perſons excommunicated by the viſible Church, or that ſeparate themſelues from the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church for feare of being cenſured vpon theſe cauſes or occaſions; the former Maximes are vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally true. There is no hope of ſaluation for them vntill they returne againe into the boſome of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church by vnfaigned ſorrow, and by true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and repentance. Yet ſuppoſe they neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe to the viſible Church; they are not therefore depriued of ſaluation becauſe they are <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Eccleſiam viſibilem,</hi> out of the viſible Church;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7910:60"/>
but becauſe they were <hi>caſt</hi> or went out of it, vpon ſuch cauſes or occaſions, as did firſt make them to be <hi>extra Eccleſiam ſanctam &amp; catholicam,</hi> out of the Holy, and Catholike Church. Or, in caſe by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance they returne againe into the viſible Church, whence they were caſt out, and obtaine ſaluation: yet are they not therefore ſaued, becauſe they are in the viſible Church, ſaue onely as it is the meane, or an inſtrument of reuniting them vnto the <hi>Holy, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike</hi> Church, or of ingraffing them into Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Other opinions or errors in religion there be, that be <hi>ex ſpecie</hi> very dangerous, yet not deadly, vnleſſe they be in a high degree; or perhaps in the higheſt degree not deadly in themſelues, vnleſſe they be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with ſome ſpice of ſome other pertinacie or diſobedient humor, more then ariſeth meerly from the ſtrength or habit of the errour, or from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the obiect, about which the errour is. To be perſwaded that the bleſſed Virgin did not continue ſo pure a virgin (all her life time) after our Sauiours birth, as ſhe was before, is certainly an errour <hi>ex ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> very dangerous; yet nothing ſo deadly as the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> which held that our Sauiour Chriſt did not, after his reſurrection and glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, continue as truly man, as he was before.</p>
                  <p>So long as a man holds errours of this ſecond ranke onely to himſelfe, being not ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by the meſſengers of truth, to diſcern their danger, nor admoniſhed by paſtorall authority to abandon them: as it cannot bee denyed that hee is <hi>ſoule-ſicke</hi>; ſo it is not ſafe to affirme that hee is ſicke of them vnto death, no not after the ſecond or third

monition, vnleſſe his monitions be ſeaſoned or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with a large meaſure of fatherly and louing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, grounded vpon perſpicuitie of truth. Frequent contempt or neglect of ſuch admonitions, though it be in matters not altogether deadly, may induce a ſeparation from the holy, Catholike faith, vnto which nothing is more oppoſite then diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in caſes wherein obedience by the Law of God is due.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Euery one that is not rooted in faith, and not truly ingraffed in Chriſt, although for ſpeculatiue opinions, he be an Orthodoxe, yet is he in reſpect of ſaluation but as an <hi>Embryon,</hi> or as the ſeed or homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneall Element, from which vegetables or liuing bodies ſpring.

Now every errour (as was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated before) in matters of Religion, is a tainting, or an infection or ſickneſſe of the ſoule, and of errors
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7910:61"/>
ſome are ſo deadly, that neither the boſome of the Church, nor all the benefits of Chriſts death committed to her cuſtodies, (though imparted in as ample manner, as ſhe can diſtribute,) can reuiue or quicken the parties tainted with them. Other errors againe there be not ſo dangerous in their kind, or not ſo ful grown, but that the parties tainted with them, may retaine or recouer life; ſo they may continue in the viſible Church, and enioy the communion of Saints, and participate with them in the word of life, in deuout prayers, and in the ordinary vſe of Sacraments. Howbeit, even theſe errours alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come deadly, if the parties in whom they ſettle, bee with <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Iſmael</hi> caſt out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the wilderneſſe, or be conſtrained to dwell in <hi>Meſech,</hi> or to haue their habitation amongſt the Tents of <hi>Kedar.</hi>

                  <p>Now in reſpect of ſuch as are caſt out of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, becauſe they will not abandon or caſt out ſuch naughty, though not deadly opinions, out of their ſoules; the former rule of <hi>Weſelius</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning excommunication failes, if it bee extended as farre as ſome haue done it. For ſome haue taught or by their ſpeeches giuen others iuſt occaſion to conceiue their meaning to bee, That the viſible Church hath onely a declaratiue ſentence in all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications: whereas this rule is to be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto excommunications onely of the former ranke, that is, ſuch as are directed againſt manifeſt hereſies, <hi>ex ſpecie</hi> hereticall and deadly. To kill a man already dead in hereſie, the Church cannot, but onely declare him to be dead. The viſible Church
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7910:61"/>
notwithſtanding hath power ſimply and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to excommunicate ſome of her members, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it doth not fully appeare vnto her, whether the opinions wherewith their ſoules are tainted, doe either neceſſarily induce or argue a ſchiſme or ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the holy Catholike faith. Yea though this point be doubtfull, or though it be more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the opinions as held by them, doe not induce a ſeparation from the holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church or Faith: yet may the viſible Church vſe her authoritie of binding them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue bound themſelues, and depriue them of all communion with the ſound and orthodoxe members of the Church; leſt happily they might by their vicinitie infect others.

What particular opinions did induce or argue a defection fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith, or diuorce from the Catholike Church, was neuer conſented vpon by the ancient Fathers, nor could their ioynt authoritie in this caſe be ſo great, as in the former. The latter ages of ſuch, as in reſpect of vs are ancient, are in this point various and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious. But of the vſe &amp; effects or iuſt cauſes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, we ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeak more particularly hereafter. The rules moſt pertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to our preſent buſines, &amp; which ſerue as an entry to the main controuerſie betwixt vs &amp; the Romaniſts, are two.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The former immediately concernes Prelates or Church Gouernours. They are alwaies to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that this power is giuen them, not for deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or to ſhew their owne greatneſſe, but for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of others; and therefore neuer to be vſed but vpon ſpeciall and weighty occaſions. Hee that ſtrikes fiercely, with his ſpirituall ſword, at feathers, doth alwaies either wound himſelfe, or wreſt his arme: neither is it ſafe to meaſure the iuſtice of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates proceedings, by the euent; or to collect, that God doth approue their ſentence, becauſe the partie ſentenced by them, may often come to a wofull or feareful end. They may dye in their ſinnes, and Gods iuſtice may be manifeſt in the manner of their death,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7910:64"/>
and yet for all this their blood may bee required at their hands, which did thus <hi>rule them with a rod of iron, or feede them,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>with the ſword, when they ſhould haue nouriſhed them with the milke of the Goſpell,</hi> or at leaſt haue vſed <hi>ſalutari ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate,</hi> wholeſome ſeueritie towards them. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond caueat concernes priuate men; and it is, that they be more vnwilling to ſeparate themſelues from the viſible Church, then to be cut off from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth wherein they liue. The occaſions of voluntary ſeparation ought to be more weighty and hainous, in reſpect of the parties from whom they voluntarily ſeparate themſelues; then are the cauſes of excommunication, for which inferiours are vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, yet iuſtly ſeparated from the Church by their Gouernours. <hi>Cato,</hi> as one ſaith, could not haue committed ſo hainous a murther by killing another man, as by killing himſelfe: for I thinke it had ſcarce beene poſſible for him to haue killed any Romane that had leſſe deſerued death than himſelfe did: yet not in this reſpect onely, but ſimply and abſolutely, it was a greater ſinne in him, and is more vnlawfull for any man to kill himſelfe, then to kill another. The rule is as true in this point of ſpirituall murther; that is, of vnlawfull ſeparation (actiue or paſſiue) from the viſible Church. Though it be a grieuous ſinne in Gouernours to depriue their inferiours of all communion with the viſible Church vpon light and vnneceſſarie occaſions; yet it is a greater ſinne in inferiours to depriue themſelues of the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion vpon the ſame or like occaſions, eſpecially if they bee not certaine elſewhere to inioy the like
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7910:65"/>
or equiualent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion without diſturbance. Such as intend a ſeparation, muſt alwaies reſpect, as well <hi>terminum ad quem,</hi> as <hi>terminum à quo,</hi> whom they goe to, as from whom they depart. It is a motto better befitting Chriſtians in violent perſecutions, by heathens, then in voluntary ſeparation from Chriſtian Churches: <hi>Quos fugiam habeo, quo fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am non habeo: I know from whom I flye, but whither to flye, I know not.</hi> To forſake the Church wherein wee haue beene baptized, for the foule abuſes that wee know by experience to bee committed in it; before we be certaine in what other Church we may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, in which there is not in ſome kinde or other, the like or worſe abuſes, or more vnſufferable grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances: were as deſperate a madneſſe, as for a paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to leape into the Sea, becauſe hee knew the ſhip wherein he ſayled, and the company with whom he muſt neceſſarily conuerſe, were deepely infected with a deadly peſtilence. And thus to doe, were a deſperate pranke, vnleſſe the partie aduenturing, had very great skill in ſwimming, and were withall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ken of ſome comfortable ſhore or harbour.</p>
                  <p>All this may ſeeme to make for our Aduerſaries, or at leaſt againſt our forefathers, which were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times members of the viſible Romiſh Church, but did either voluntarily ſeparate themſelues from it, or ſuffer themſelues to be thruſt out of it; when as they might haue retained communion with it, ſo they would haue imbraced their doctrine. Beſides the danger of ſeparation from it, both they and we haue felt the ſeuereſt ſtrokes of the ſpirituall ſword of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, which the Gouernours of the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7910:65"/>
Romiſh Church could reach vs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The branches of the maine controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that Church and ours, are two. The firſt, [whether the reaſons which moued our forefathers to depart from that Church, or not to imbrace her doctrines, were iuſt and neceſſary.]</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, [Whether our forefathers, being howſoeuer ſeparated from it, had commiſſion, full power and iuſt authority from God to vnite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into a true viſible <hi>Church</hi>; whether they did rightly purſue ſuch warrant or commiſſion as they had, and whether they and we haue beene and are a true viſible <hi>Church.</hi>] The iuſt and neceſſary reaſons, for which men (whether few or many) may and ought to ſeparate themſelues from any viſible <hi>Church,</hi> are in generall two. The firſt, becauſe they are vrged or conſtrained to profeſſe or beleeue ſome points of doctrine, or to aduenture vpon ſome prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, which are contrary to the rule of faith, or Law of God; and are either <hi>ex ſpecie,</hi> or <hi>ex gradu &amp; cumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> either for their ſpecificall quality, or for their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then or number, ſo hereticall and deadly, that they neceſſarily induce a ſeparation from the <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike</hi> faith, without which the Church can neither be <hi>holy</hi> nor <hi>Catholike.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond, in caſe they are vtterly depriued of freedome of conſcience in profeſſing what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly beleeue, or bee bereft of ſome other meanes either altogether neceſſarie or moſt expedient to ſaluation, both which may be had in ſome other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>Church.</hi> In this later caſe, that rule of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle giuen vnto ſeruants, is true; <hi>Let every man
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7910:66"/>
abide in the ſame calling,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen we debate the lawfulneſſe of our Forefathers ſeparation from the Romiſh Church; we meane the then Romiſh Church as viſible.</p>
                  <p>Now vnto the conſtitution of an entire and compleat viſible Church, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7910:66"/>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> an vnity of faith and doctrine: <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> an vnitie of diſcipline or coactiue Lawes, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially an vnitie of ſubordination to one indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Iudicature.</p>
                  <p>Vnity in points of faith and doctrine, is more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall to the Church as it is holy and Catholike, that is, as it is Orthodoxall.</p>
                  <p>Vnity of Lawes or diſcipline, or of independent Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature is more eſſentiall, and more neceſſary to the Church, as <hi>viſible.</hi> Hence as wee ſaid before, there be as many diſtinct viſible Churches, as there be independent Iudicatures, or ſupreame Tribunalls Eccleſiaſticke. Vnto a Catholike Church or vnto a Church viſibly Catholike, ſuch as the Romaniſts beleeue their Church to be, both kinds of vnity are neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Whether this vnitie of diſcipline, full power of Iuriſdiction, or independent <hi>Iudicature,</hi> be ſeated in one perſon or more, that is, whether the forme of eccleſiaſticall gouernment be <hi>Ariſtocraticall</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall,</hi> is in our Diuinity all one. The vnitie or conformitie may be as compleat and perfect the one way, as the other. But the Romaniſts, the Engliſh Prieſts, and Ieſuits, doe not onely hold this vnity of independent Iudicature to be neceſſary to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the viſible, Catholike Church; but that it muſt of neceſſity be <hi>radically</hi> in one perſon, to wit, in the <hi>Pope,</hi> on whom as vpon the head and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the vnity of the Holy, Catholike viſible Church, doth depend: and for this reaſon they put his Holineſſe in the definition of the Holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, as you heard before out of Cardinall
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7910:67"/>
                     <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and the Author of the Antidote. So that the Popes <hi>ſupremacie</hi> hath the ſame place in the whole viſible <hi>Church,</hi> as euery <hi>ſummum genus</hi> in his proper predicament. As nothing can bee truly ſaid to be in the predicament, vnleſſe it participate the nature or definition of the <hi>ſummum genus:</hi> ſo none by this doctrine, can be a true member of the holy Church, vnleſſe he be ſubordinate to the Pope: Or, as <hi>no man can come to the Father, but by the Sonne</hi>; ſo none can come vnto the ſonne, but by this Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>Pope.</hi> Euery one muſt be viſibly vnited vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him and to his Lawes, before he can be myſtically or ſpiritually vnited vnto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit by putting the Pope in the definition of the Holy, Catholike Church, with intention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to exclude vs from it, who denie his authority; they intangle and fetter themſelues in another point of great conſequence betwixt vs &amp; them: of which aduantage we ſhall make ſome better vſe hereafter. The ſumme of our preſent diſpute is this.</p>
                  <p>As profeſſing of vnitie with the Romiſh Church in all points of faith which that Church teacheth, doth neceſſarily induce a diſunion or ſeparation from the holy Catholike Faith and Church: ſo the acknowledgment of ſuch ſubordination as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the head of it, in matters of diſcipline or iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, induceth flat rebellion or high treaſon, againſt all free States or Kingdomes Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The reaſons which moued our forefathers to forſake the viſible Romiſh church, or to ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be forſaken by it, and withhold vs from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, were and are in two reſpects moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7910:67"/>
and iuſt. Iuſt they were, and are neceſſary; Firſt on the behalfe of euery priuate man that had or hath a care of conſcience and Religion. Secondly, on behalfe of Prince and State, in reſpect of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and religious policie. And firſt of the reaſons in behalfe of King and State: Their poſitions which induce rebellion againſt free States &amp; Kingdomes, and which, were they ioyntly admitted, would leaue ſupereminent or royall Maieſtie onely a naked title, without any realtie of ſoueraignty or iuriſdiction, are two.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the ſpirituall power is aboue all ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or ciuill power. And this aſſertion, were it right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly limited, is in it ſelfe orthodoxall. But the more orthodoxall it is in it ſelfe, the more deadly it makes the ſecond poſition, vnto which they ſeeke to wed it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond poſition is, That this ſupreame and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power is totally ſeated in the Clergie, as in a body diſtinct from the body politike: Yea the moſt of them hold the plenitude of this power, to bee in the Pope, from whom all ſpirituall power of iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is deriued to the reſt of the Clergie, after the ſame manner, as iuriſdiction in cauſes temporall is deriued to inferiour Magiſtrates from the Monarch or ſupreame Maieſtie in euery Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>The Regiment of the Church, as they ſay, is <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimen monarchicum,</hi> a viſible Monarchy, of which the Pope is the viſible Monarch. As the ſpirituall power, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or Pope vſurpeth is intenſiuely moſt abſolute &amp; independent: ſo is the obiect of it for extenſion moſt tranſcendent and illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7910:68"/>
Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third by vertue of this ſuppoſed plenary power did challenge to bee ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Iudge in cenſuring or puniſhing mortall ſins: <hi>Intendimus decernere de peccato, cuius ad nos pertinet ſine dubitatione cenſura, &amp;</hi> (or <hi>vt) nullus qui ſit ſanae mentis ignorat quin ad officium noſtrum ſpectet de quocunque peccato mortali corripere quemlibet Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> cap. nouit. de Iudicijs. <hi>We intend</hi> (faith he) <hi>to determine concerning Sinne, the cenſure whereof ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably appertaines to vs, that no man well in his wits can be ignorant, that it is a part of our power or office to chaſtiſe or correct euery Chriſtian man for any mortall ſinne of what kind ſoeuer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if in this Cathedrall conſtitution hee did not erre; the Chriſtian world might haue as infallible a perpetual rule for guiding Millers hands and Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors ſheeres, and for preuenting or puniſhing all co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zenage in Trades or Crafts, as it hath for ending controuerſies in matters of faith or diuinity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It is an idle and friuolous diſtinction which ſome Canoniſts haue framed to ſolue the truth of this Popes ſentence. <hi>Aliud eſt de re, actione aut contractu iudicare, &amp; aliud iudicare de peccato: It is one thing to determine of the action or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract, another to determine or iudge of the ſin committed.</hi> For as Father<note n="*" place="margin">See this point ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently handled by father <hi>Paul,</hi> whoſe Apologie for the ſtate of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> (as I now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue) is tranſlated into the Engliſh tongue.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently obſerues, <hi>quod inſeparabile eſt diſtinguunt: they put a diuerſity without a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</hi> For if the pope may iudge of euery matter or contract as it is a ſin, I hope he would prohibit it, if it were a ſin, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell men to obſerue his Edicts or prohibitions. And doing thus, what remaines to bee done by any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power, whether ſupreame or ſubordinate, but
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7910:68"/>
onely to looke on, or to be as Sheriffes to ſee his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees put in execution, or to be his hangman or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner. No Magiſtrate doth puniſh but vpon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall of ſome fault or ſinne committed. <hi>Lex non eſt iuſt is poſita,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ſed iniuſtis. The Law punitiue is not giuen againſt the iuſt, but againſt the vniuſt.</hi> And if the Pope might be ſupreame Iudge of euery mortall ſinne, euery malefactor might haue the benefit of appeale vnto him in all matters crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. He might puniſh Princes for making vniuſt Lawes, or for not executing ſuch Lawes, as they themſelues haue made or haue found made vnto their hands by their Predeceſſors, or as hee ſhall make or appoint them to make.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Againe, all of them agree in this, that the Pope hath a ſupreame independent power to make coac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Eccleſiaſticke Lawes for the welfare of the Church; &amp; in as much as all temporall power is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the power ſpiritual, which, as his ſubiects ſay, is originally and plenarie in himſelfe; hee may by vertue of this ſupreame ſpirituall power, diſanull all ſuch Lawes as any temporall State or Kingdome ſhall make, if theſe to his Holineſſe vnerring ſpirit, ſhall ſeeme contrary to the Lawes of God, or to the Lawes Eccleſiaſticke, made by himſelfe, or by his predeceſſors.

                  <p>The exerciſe of this terrible power hath beene within theſe 400. yeeres, frequent in many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7910:69"/>
and famous of late againſt the <hi>Venetians.</hi> That ancient and renowned State for wiſedome and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity, and of all States profeſſing Romiſh faith, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies moſt venerable for deuotion, had made ſuch a Law, as the Law of Mortmaine here in <hi>England,</hi> for repreſſing the exceſſe of <hi>Leuies</hi> portion, which was become like a huge deformed wen in a faire and comely body: and being admoniſhed by the Pope to repeale this Law, and another edict ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the preſeruation of peace; whereby the vnruly Cleargie within their territories were <hi>ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> to the cenſure of the State; becauſe the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> would not obey his monitions, and betray their ancient liberties, the Duke and Senate were excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by his Holineſſe. I doe not well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whether that State had made a decree, that no prouiſion ſhould be carried out of their territories to <hi>Ancona:</hi> but put the caſe, they had made ſuch a Law, in as much as <hi>Ancona</hi> is a Citie which belongs to <hi>Peters</hi> patrimony, a ſegniorie or Lordſhip of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> this Law muſt be controleable by the Pope, becauſe it is preiudiciall to the Church.

For an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man to haue receiued any title of Iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7910:69"/>
from the Pope, or any forraigne Prelate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto him, was by the ancient Lawes of this land, a <hi>praemunire.</hi> I will onely touch ſo much of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Churches practice in this State,<note place="margin">See Sir <hi>Edward Cokes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi> in <hi>Lailors</hi> caſe.</note> as forraigne Writers haue taken notice of, which was enough to giue our Kings iuſt occaſion to make ſuch Lawes of <hi>praemunire,</hi> as the forecited Author produceth.</p>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third (preſuming vpon his former rule, that it belonged vnto him, <hi>de quocun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que peccato mortali corripere quemlibet chriſtianum,) to cenſure or puniſh euery man, for any mortall ſinne</hi>;) charged <hi>Iohn,</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King, to keepe the Churches peace, vnder paine of his curſe. And in the proceſſe, excommunicates the <hi>French</hi> King, for taking armes againſt King <hi>Iohn.</hi> After, the ſame <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, (vpon what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure I know not) excommunicates King <hi>Iohn,</hi> armes the <hi>French</hi> King with the ſpirituall ſword, to make warre, authorizing King <hi>Iohns</hi> owne naturall ſubiects to rebell againſt him; vntill the poore King was brought ſo low, that he was content to become the Popes Farmer of his owne Kingdome: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once admitted his Tenant, and become Farmer to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> his priuiledge was greater, and his perſon more ſacred, than it had beene by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods Vicegerent. For the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> excommunicated all ſuch as did or ſhould moleſt or vexe him; ſo long as hee remained the Churches <hi>Rent-gatherer.</hi> This ſtrange ods, hath the holineſſe of that Church, of other things, which by Gods Law were counted holy; that whatſoeuer doth but touch it, nay whatſoeuer hath but vicinitie with it,

and relation or reference to it, ſtraight way becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Holy, and capable of greater priuiledges, then Princes or the Lords anointed are.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 From this ſuperexcellent Holineſſe of their Church, they now pretend that euery Cleargie or Church man is exempt from all Iuriſdiction tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; as if their perſons, on whom the Pope or his Biſhops lay their holy hands, become more holy and ſacred, then royall power it ſelfe, which as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>is from God:</hi> ſo ſacred and holy, that no temporall ſword may touch them, leſt their <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> ſhould be polluted. Some profeſſed reformers of their Schoole Diuinitie, ſince the light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell brake forth, haue not beene afraid or aſhamed to plead that this exemption of the Cleargie from ſecular Iuriſdiction, is <hi>de iure diuino, by diuine Law,</hi> and ratified by that Text, <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 2. cap. verſ. 15</note> 
                     <hi>Spiritualis homo diiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat omnia, ipſe autem à nemine iudicatur, Hee that is ſpirituall, iudgeth all things, yet he himſelfe is iudged of no man.</hi> But were the allegation true or pertinent, either there ſhould be no ſpirituall men beſides the Pope, and ſo the ſubiect of the propoſition, ſhould be <hi>homo ſingularis, one man onely</hi>; or, if there be more ſpirituall men, they ſhould all of them bee Popes to iudge all others, and be iudged of none, no not of the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> himſelfe, vnleſſe hee be no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. For theſe are conuertible; <hi>Qui omnes dicit, nemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem excipit, Qui neminem dicit, omnes excipit. He that ſaith all, excepteth none; and hee that ſaith none, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But howeuer, if all Cleargie men may by the Pope be exempted from all Iuriſdiction temporall,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7910:70"/>
and he may make as many Cleargie men as hee liſt, or liſt to be made by him, and make ſuch Lawes for them as it pleaſeth him: who ſees not how eaſily he may bereaue Princes of their naturall ſubiects. The caſe betwixt them is on the Popes ſide, like a game at draughts or Cheſts, wherein the one partie hath gotten the ſtart or aduantage to make as many Kings as he liſt, and the other hauing loſt his opportunitie of taking the like aduantage, muſt bee ſure to looſe the game, if the play hold.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Againe, ſeeing they make the Pope to bee the ſupreame <hi>head</hi> in al cauſes Eccleſiaſticke or ſpirituall, and ouer all Eccleſiaſticke perſons: I ſee no reaſon but that euery Prieſt and Ieſuite of the <hi>Engliſh, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation, ſhould bee indited for mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſacred Maieſtie, as often as they inſtile him their Soueraigne Lord. For euery one that in good earneſt cals the King his Lord, is preſumed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himſelfe to be the Kings Subiect. Now euery Subiect, is a Subiect in reſpect of Iuriſdiction. To be the Kings Subiect, and not to be ſubiect to the Kings Iuriſdiction, implyes a contradiction. So that in finall concluſion, for <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prieſts to call the King their Lord, and yet to profeſſe and beleeue, that their perſons belong not properly to his Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, but to the Popes; is all one, as if they ſhould ſay: <hi>Noah</hi> indeed was <hi>Iaphets</hi> Father, and <hi>Iaphet</hi> did well ſo to call him; but <hi>Iaphet</hi> was not <hi>Noahs</hi> ſonne, nor did he owe him any filiall obedience: as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he did not, if he had beene exempted from <hi>Noahs</hi> paternall Iuriſdiction, after the ſame manner, as the Romiſh Prieſts are from Iuriſdiction temporall. But
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7910:71"/>
to ſubmit the whole temporall power and lawes made by it, to the ſpirituall power, as it reſideth in the Pope; is to make all Princes and Monarchs more ſubiect vnto him, then inferiour or ſecular Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are to them: not ſo much as <hi>meane</hi> Lords in <hi>fee,</hi> but meere Tenants at <hi>will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet is this ſubiection of all temporall power vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Popes ſpirituall power, not the opinion onely of the Romiſh Cleargie or flattering Canoniſts: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen their Ciuilians are infected with this hereticall and trayterous doctrine. Witneſſe that otherwiſe learned and ingenuous <hi>Ciuilian, Balthazar Ayala,</hi> ſometimes chiefe Iuſtice of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Prince of <hi>Parma, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de iure et officijs belli, cap.</hi> 2. ſect; 27.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 If wee put both theſe poſitions together, to wit, That the Pope hath power to exempt all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticke perſons from Iuriſdiction temporall, and to ſubiect all temporall lawes to ſpirituall lawes of his making; we may <hi>repeale</hi> or antiquate an ancient and vſuall diſtinction of the ſword ſpirituall and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. For by theſe deuices, they haue put ſuch a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <hi>handle</hi> vpon the temporall ſword, and giuen the <hi>Pope</hi> ſo faſt hold of it, that if hee and Chriſtian Kings ſhould at any time fall at variance, his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (ſo long as this doctrine ſtands authentique) may bee ſure to haue the drawing of it, and poore Chriſtian Princes, to whom the ſword by right (more ancient then the Popedome is) properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, muſt bee contend to defend themſelues with the ſcabbard.</p>
                  <p>For theſe and many like reaſons, our forefathers
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7910:71"/>
departure from the viſible Romiſh Church, was moſt iuſt and neceſſarie on the behalfe of Prince and State, and in reſpect of lawfull and Chriſtian policie.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 The reaſons on the behalfe of euery priuate man, were in two reſpects, againe moſt neceſſary. Firſt, becauſe that Church did and doth vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, euen to her owne children, the free vſe of means, either altogether neceſſary, or moſt expedient to ſaluation. Theſe ſhe will not giue vnto her own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; no, nor ſel them at any lower rate, then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſets vpon his wares; that is, <hi>they muſt fall downe and worſhip her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly and principally, becauſe the Church did and doth rigidly and peremptorily exact our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe and profeſſion of many doctrinall points, and vpon ſuch beliefe inioyne many practices; of both which ſome are <hi>ex ſpecie,</hi> for qualitie ſo hereticall and diabolicall; others <hi>ex gradu et cumulo, for degree or multitude,</hi> ſo deadly, as they manifeſtly induce a ſeparation from the Holy Catholike Church, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſarily argue a contradiction to the Holy, Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and primitiue faith. So that beſides the exceſſiue price which the Romiſh Church ſets vpon her own childrens neceſſary food, they may not eate it after they haue bought it, vnleſſe it be mingled with dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poyſon.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine of the Popes <hi>ſupremacie,</hi> of the Churches, or the Popes abſolute <hi>infallibility,</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith and manners, is an errour in it ſelfe, <hi>ex ſpecie,</hi> hereticall and more deadly then heatheniſme: and includeth <hi>infidelitatem prauae diſpoſitionis, infide<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7910:72"/>
of contradiction,</hi> as malignant as the infidelity of the Iewes; and the conſequent of it, is an entire Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie from the Apoſtolike faith. This I haue <note n="*" place="margin">In the third book vpon the Creede, Section the laſt.</note> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where endeauoured to ſhew at large; the ſumme of which worke, ſhall by Gods aſſiſtance, bee recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in this Treatiſe. I now meddle onely with this tranſcendent hereſie, as it is diffuſed through other errours. The very participation of it, is as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ked, either from Heretikes of old, or from ſome miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings or miſreadings of ancient Fathers, are malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and made much worſe then they were in their firſt Authors. Our firſt inſtance ſhall be in the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and daily tranſgreſſions of that rule of faith, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by our Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>verſe</hi> 5. into all which tranſgreſſions, this doctrine doth leade and draw them blindfold, as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> did <hi>Sampſon,</hi> after they had put out his eyes. The Apoſtles rule is, <hi>Let euery man be fully perſwaded in his owne minde.</hi> And this full perſwaſion or aſſurance of faith, is, in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes there mentioned neceſſary; <hi>becauſe whatſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne, verſe</hi> 23. This laſt Maxime is moſt vndoubtedly true, and the former precept moſt exactly to be obſerued, in ſuch caſes, as the Apoſtle there ſpeakes of: that is, where the poſitiue practice (vnleſſe our warrant bee authentique in it ſelfe, and euident to vs,) is very dangerous or deadly; whereas on the contrary, the forbearance of ſuch practice is either ſafe, or not preiudiciall to our ſoules, but to our bodies onely, or eſtate temporall. But in what caſes doth the authoritie of the Romiſh Church,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7910:72"/>
where it beares ſway, draw men to tranſgreſſe the former rules of faith or conſcience? In many.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 To rob God of his honour, or doe him preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice in his glorious titles of <hi>mercy, bounty,</hi> and the like, is vnqueſtionably a grieuous ſinne: and being ſuch, no doctrine or practice ought to bee admitted or impoſed vpon vs, which with probabilitie may induce or inferre it; eſpecially, if the end or benefit for whoſe attainement the ſuſpected doctrine or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is imagined behoofefull or vſefull, may as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely be obtained by ſome other more ſafe and no leſſe effectuall or conuenient meanes.
If from theſe grounds wee ſhould enter friendly conference with an ingenuous Papiſt, and tell him, as the truth is, that <q>we Proteſtants doe teach, That good workes are moſt neceſſarie to ſaluation; and that the more ſuch workes we doe, the greater certainely ſhall be our reward, ſo wee doe them in ſinceritie, and acknowledgement of our bounden dutie towards God, humbly confeſſing our ſelues</q> (after we haue done all, euen our very beſt) to bee <hi>vnprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</hi> It from theſe allegations we ſhall thus inferre, that glory, honour, immortality, and eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in the life to come, being all that hee ſeekes after by wel-doing; ſeeing wee ſeeke for the very ſelfe ſame things, by a ſafer and leſſe ſuſpitious way, why ſhould hee not be content to abandon all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of <hi>merit,</hi> and to renounce the <hi>tearme</hi> as an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue and ſuſpicious title, for a poore ſuppliant to vſe before the Almighty Maieſty of God. To this and like <hi>Quaeries,</hi> all the anſwer you ſhall get, is this: and this you ſhall haue from the more iudicious and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7910:73"/>
ingenuous ſecular Papiſts; that for their owne parts, they could be wel content to relinquiſh the opinion or terme of <hi>Merit,</hi> ſo they were left vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; but they muſt vſe the one, and maintaine the other in obedience to the <hi>Church.</hi> So ſtrong a hand hath the Church his mother ouer his faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that hee had rather aduenture to ſtand vpon reall <hi>termes</hi> of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> or come to iuridicall conteſtation with God his Creator and Redeemer, than diſobey or diſſent from her in the vſe of words, or in matters of conceit or opinion onely.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 <q>Again, no Chriſtian denies that our Sauiour is able to heare our prayers at all times &amp; in all places; that he is more fauourable and compaſſionate vnto vs, then any Saint in Heauen or earth can be; that his Father alwaies heareth him. It is likewiſe a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall article of our beliefe, that wee ought at all times to pray vnto him, that he would pray vnto his Father for vs; that it is our duty to offer vp our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and the beſt ſacrifice of our ſoules and ſpirits in honour of his <hi>great and glorious name</hi>; that to come vnto the Father by his mediation, is to worſhip him in truth and ſpirit.</q> All theſe poſitions are <hi>ex fide &amp; de fide, points of neceſsity to be beleeued.</hi> And if we were alwayes imployed in ſome of theſe practices, happy were we, although we did nothing elſe. No Saint, we may bee ſure, would bee offended with vs for praying continually vnto Chriſt, vnto whom they contiuall pray or giue thanks. But whether in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto Saints as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> doe, wee doe not offend both Chriſt and them, is not ſo clear and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:7910:73"/>12 To requeſt the Saints deceaſed to pray for vs without expreſſe warrant or aſſurance that they can hear our praiers, is ſuperſtitious; to offer vp our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vnto them by way of <hi>Honour</hi> or tribute, without aſſurance of faith, is flat Idolatry. Yet admitting it were lawfull not onely to pray, but to offer our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vnto their Images; yet to fall down before them and worſhip them, is certainly a practice ſo quite contrary to the rule of faith, and Gods holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, that he which feareth God, (who hath expreſſed himſelfe in this point aboue others to be a iealous God) would in ordinary diſcretion and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, before hee durſt aduenture vpon ſo dangerous a practice, demand as expreſſe a diſpenſation or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand to the former precept, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had to aſſure him, he ſhould not commit murder by ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his only ſonne.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, admitting the invocation of true and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Saints, (as for example, the Apoſtles) and the adoration of their Images, to be no ſacrilege or wrong to God; yet to honor euery one who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope ſhall canonize for a Saint, with all the former points of honour, which they exhibit to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c is a great wrong vnto thoſe glorious Saints, an hereſie, or rather an Idolatry <hi>ex ſpecie</hi> deadly. And yet for aduenturing vpon all theſe dangerous practices, they haue no other aſſurance of faith or warrant of ſcripture, beſides their vnwarrantable and blind beleife of the Chruch and Popes infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Nor can the ingenuous Papiſts giue vs any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer to ſuch reaſonable demands, as were now propoſed in this point of Inuocation of Saints,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7910:74"/>
or adoration of Images, then was giuen before, That <hi>Hee doth all this in obedience to his mother the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhould proceed to the like faithleſſe and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate practices in the Maſſe, for which they can haue no true aſſurance or warrant from God or his Lawes; but onely rely vpon the ſuppoſed infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of this Church, which notwithſtanding may be manifeſtly conuinced of groſſe and ſtupid hereſie, in the doctrine of <hi>

                        </gap>ranſubſtantiation.</hi> But becauſe the doctrine is <hi>ex ſpecie</hi> hereticall, and the practice dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſhall reſerue the refutation of both, &amp; the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the ancient and orthodoxall opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the manner of Chriſts preſence in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or communication of his body and blood, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a peculiar Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 Generally, the more dangerous or deadly any practice doth ſeeme to bee, whileſt wee compare it with the ordinary &amp; common rule of mans actions; the more euidently it ought to appeare vnto him that vndertakes it, by what ſpeciall rule or warrant it is exempted from the common rule or generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of other facts and practices in nature and appearance like it. If a Iudge ſhould charge the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe or other inferiour officer to ſee execution done vpon ſome malefactor; it were no wiſedome for the inferior Officer to aduenture vpon the <hi>Iudges</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, vnleſſe hee knew that the Iudge had ſpeciall commiſſion and warrant from the King to ſentence him to death, and that hee had legally ſo ſentenced him. Yet would it be a point of ill manners and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion for an inferior Iuſtice or officer, to require
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7910:74"/>
the like ſpeciall warrant or expreſſe rule of Law for whipping a vagrant perſon, or putting ſome idle fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the ſtocks. The Iudges word or command might in this caſe be a ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is nicitie, ill manners, and indiſcretion to exact an expreſſe rule of ſcripture or faith for ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the <hi>Creed,</hi> for kneeling at the Lords board, for vſing the Cap and Surplice. In theſe caſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Church or tradition will ſuffice; ſo there be not any expreſſe Law or commandement to the contrary.

                  <p>That wee had a viſible Church before <hi>Luthers</hi> time in this Kingdome, altogether diſtinct from the Romiſh viſible Church planted in this Kingdome before <hi>Luther</hi> was borne, or ſo diſtinct as <hi>reſpublica Venetorum</hi> is <hi>à Regno Gallia,</hi> as the State of <hi>Venice</hi> is from the kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> ſeemes very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to the Romaniſts, and ſomewhat hard for vs to proue; vnleſſe we will deriue our pedigree from the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> the <hi>Picardi,</hi> or the poore men of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> which to doe I know not how ſafe it is, or how well pleaſing it would be to the preſent viſible Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Church, vnleſſe we had better records of their tenets, then I haue ſeene, or then the viſible Romiſh Church, that <hi>de facto</hi> condemnes them for heretiks, was willing to propagate to poſteritie. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide; if our Church before <hi>Luthers</hi> time, was a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7910:77"/>
member of the then Romiſh Church, wee ſhall bee further queſtioned, what authoritie our King and State had, either to diſmember their Church, or to make a new intire diſtinct Church of an old diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred part of their Church. In theſe and like obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they alwaies ſuppoſe two things as vnqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, which we vtterly deny.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, that the whole multitude of Chriſtians throughout theſe Weſterne parts, as <hi>England, France, Germany, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spaine, &amp;c.</hi> excepting ſuch as were by their Church diſclaymed for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes or ſchiſmatikes, were all members of the then viſible Romiſh Church: and that there was ſuch an vnion betwixt all and euery one of this multitude, as ſufficeth to make all indiuiduals within theſe States or Kingdomes, true members of one viſible, or of the then viſible Romiſh Church.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, They ſuppoſe that our vnion with ſome preſent viſible Church, is a natiue degree or part of our vnion with the Holy, Catholike Church: or that our vnion with ſome preſent viſible Church, is neceſſary or eſſentiall, not accidentall to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or not being members of the Holy, Catholike Church.</p>
                  <p>For our more orderly and ſafe proceeding, wee are in the firſt place to ſhake, and hereafter (by Gods helpe) to raze theſe two rotten foundations, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all their arguments, either for annoying ours, or for ſupporting their Church, are grounded.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Our firſt Counterfort ſhall be this. All the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregations recounted by reformed Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which before <hi>Luthers</hi> time, had either ſeparated
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7910:78"/>
themſelues from the viſible Romiſh Church of their times, or had beene diſclaimed by it for ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques or heretikes, being ſequeſtred from this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute: our Church might bee, and was in the viſible Romiſh Church (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and other profeſſed ſonnes of that Church define it,) and yet bee in it, neither ſo as to make one intire viſible Church, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from it, nor as any integrall part, or naturall member of it.</p>
                  <p>If we take all, which the Romiſh Church doth challenge for her ſonnes before <hi>Luthers</hi> time; there was in that multitude rather a Church truely viſible, than one true viſible Church, if wee meaſure the truth of the viſible Church according to our former principles, and as wee ought to meaſure it, by the conformitie which it hath with the one, truely ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Apoſtolike Church. Our meaning is, the whole multitude of Chriſtians in theſe Weſterne parts before <hi>Luthers</hi> time, (all thoſe being excluded, which the Romiſh Church repreſentatiue did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne for heretikes or ſchiſmatiques) had no ſuch vnitie, as truely anſwers to the vnitie of a body natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but an vnitie onely anſwerable to the vnitie of an heap or congeſt of Heterogeneals. Some had the number only, others the very character of the Beaſt.</p>
                  <p>The heape or congeſt which wee ſuppoſe as an Embleme of the viſible Romiſh Church (taking that Church in that amplitude which they challenge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luther</hi> by Gods appointment, attempted refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) ſhal be an heap or <hi>congeſt,</hi> of ſeueral mettals, al or moſt part vnpurified. In this one heape or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt,</hi> a great part of heterogeneals, though not all,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7910:78"/>
ſhal be ſuppoſed to haue had the vnion of continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or <hi>concretion</hi>: that is, ſome pieces of vnpurified gold, by the negligence or vnskilfulnes of the artificer, were made vp or ſuffered to make vp themſelues, in ſome clod or cake, with an huge quantitie of copper, lead, braſſe, iron, or other baſer metals, all vnpurified from their droſſe, the other part of the ſame heape or congeſt conſiſting of ſeuerall or leſſer pieces of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher metall, all homogeneall in themſelues, though many vnpurified, and wanting the vnion of <hi>contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie or concretion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 The parts of a good Mineraliſt or Refiner in this caſe, were firſt to diſſolue the cake or clod, and to ſeuer the richer metall from the baſer. Secondly, to purifie homogeneals, ſo ſeuered, from their owne droſſe. Thirdly, to make them vp ſo ſeuered or puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, into plate, wedges, or Bullion; or to put ſome other accidentall or artificiall forme vpon them. All this being done, we cannot ſay, there was a true <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> of any new body or ſubſtance, or that the Refiner did make gold where there was none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (as ſome Alchymiſts profeſſe, that they can turne iron or other metals ſpecifically diſtinct, into gold) here was only a refining of metall praeexiſtent, and an addition onely of an accidentall forme.</p>
                  <p>To parallel the Refiners worke, by the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wrought by <hi>Luther,</hi> and the Chriſtian Princes, that harkened to him: Firſt, it cannot be denyed, but that the viſible Romiſh Church, or if you will the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Romiſh Court, did beare a great ſway throughout moſt Realmes in Chriſtendome, before <hi>Luthers</hi> time. Beſides the Body of the Cleargie, or
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7910:79"/>
Church repreſentatiue, many Potentates, ſome through ignorance, others for hope of gaine or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage againſt their aduerſaries, did adhere vnto it. This faction or combination, doth in proportion anſwer to the clod or <hi>concreſcence</hi> of Heterogeneals in the <hi>emblematicall</hi> congeſt before mentioned. For, there was no true vnion betwixt them in matters of faith. On the other ſide againe, it cannot be denyed, but that many in euery Kingdome before <hi>Luther,</hi> did vtterly deteſt the tyranny of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>: many as well of their Cleargie, as of their Layetie, did in heart and affection wiſh a reformation as well of the Eccleſiaſticall Gouernment, as of the doctrine profeſſed and practiſed in their Church. The States, Princes, or priuate men thus affected, anſwer in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the ſeuerall pieces of homogeneall and richer metall in the former heape or congeſt. All that <hi>Luther,</hi> all that the Chriſtian Princes which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, did intend or vndertake, was; firſt, to diſſolue the clod, or breake the faction of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church or Court, ſpread through their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: Secondly, to refine and purifie themſelues and their adherents from the droſſe and ſoile which they had taken by their adherence vnto, or vicinitie with the Romiſh Church: Laſtly, to vnite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues thus refined and purified in matters of faith and doctrine, into a new forme of gouernment Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtike, independent on the tribunall or Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5 So then it is falſe, which our Aduerſaries ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, that <hi>Luther</hi> did take vpon him to make a new Church. For this ſuppoſeth a plantation of new faith
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7910:79"/>
or doctrine neuer planted before, in which the life and ſoule of the true Church conſiſts. Whereas they ſay we had no Church before his time, it is true one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>ſecundùm quid.</hi> Their meaning can be no other, but this, Wee had no viſible Church altogether ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and diſtinct from theirs: and this againe is true, onely in reſpect of thoſe times, wherein the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> or Emperours of <hi>Germanie,</hi> did ſubmit themſelues and their Subiects vnto the Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Albeit this ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (being wrought for the moſt part through vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or deuilliſh policie) doth not argue our fore-Elders to haue been parts or members of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from which they were ſeuered in heart and affection, and ſeuered in forme of gouernment, <hi>de iure,</hi> though not <hi>de facto.</hi> In the times of diuers Kings, the Church of <hi>England</hi> was ſeuered <hi>de iure, et de facto,</hi> from the viſible Romiſh Church. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe were diuers Churches in <hi>Germany.</hi> But for Chronologie or matter of hiſtorie, I muſt referre them to another place. The queſtion is much what the ſame, as if they ſhould aske vs, Where was King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeuenths Kingdome, where were his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, where was your Common-weale; whileſt <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the third did call Parliaments, and ſway the Scepter of this Kingdome? The Kingdome of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the ſeuenth, and of his Succeſſors, or the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Common-weale, was in the ſame place then, as now it is. The depoſition of the Tyrant, the diſſolution of the tyranny, and the reducing of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subiects to their true allegeance, did worke no eſſentiall alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Common-weale or Kingdome, but
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7910:80"/>
onely a reformation of the gouernment and reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it to the fundamentall lawes of this Land. No more did the reiection of the Romiſh Churches vſurped authority in matters ſpirituall, induce any ſubſtantiall alteration in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, but a reformation or reduction of it vnto the fundamental conſtitutions of the Primitiue Church. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to our former illuſtration: This argument, <hi>You had no viſible Church before Luthers time,</hi> ergo, <hi>you had no true Church,</hi> is no better than this; There was no Plate or Bullion in the forementioned heape or congeſt before the Refiner did his part; <hi>ergo,</hi> there was no true gold or ſiluer. For as euery part of gold, is gold, and euery part of ſiluer is ſiluer, but euery part of a wedge or plate, is not a wedge or plate: ſo euery member of the true Church of God, is himſelf a true Church and Temple of God: yet is not euery part or member of the true viſible or Catholike Church, a true viſible or Catholike Church. Or, as 8. or 10. pieces of gold, into which an Angell may be broken, though they remain for waight, for value, &amp; for ſubſtance the ſame they were; yet can they not be ſaid to be the ſame Angel, becauſe they want the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that artificial form, into which they were made: ſo likewiſe, although there were ten thouſand in this Kingdome before <hi>Luthers</hi> time, all true members of Gods Holy and Catholike Church; yet could they not be properly ſaid, one viſible Church, ſo long as they wanted that vnitie of diſcipline or independent gouernment, which we haue, for the moſt part, ſince inioyed.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Now as any kinde of metall made vp into a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7910:80"/>
wedge or other artificiall forme, is leſſe ſubiect to putrifaction, ſoile, or canker, then it was whileſt it lay ſcattered in ſeuerall fragments or pieces: ſo the vnion of Chriſtian Profeſſors into one viſible Church, is a good meanes for preſeruing euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular member, ſpecially nouices in faith, from ſuch errours, hereſies, or other temptations, as if they had beene left alone or ſcattered, would indanger their faith. And yet againe, as the perfection or puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of gold aboue other metals, is beſt proued, in that it doth not ſo eaſily take ſoile or ruſt, though it lye ſcattered in little pieces amongſt other baſer metals, or other bodies apt to taint or putrifie: ſo the true members of Chriſts Church or <hi>Body,</hi> are beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, beſt approued by liuing vpright in points of faith, in the midſt of a peruerſe or crooked genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by continuing vndefiled in the boſome of a polluted viſible Church; out of which they may not, they cannot, at their pleaſure depart, but are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the <hi>call</hi> or ſummons of Gods ſpeciall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 So then whether we had for theſe ſixe hundred yeeres a viſible Church, diſtinct from the viſible Romiſh Church or no, is not pertinent to the maine point in queſtion; for they faſly aſſume, wee iuſtly deny, that men are ſaued by being actuall or profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed members of the viſible Church, or that our vnion with the preſent viſible Church is a natiue degree or part of our vnion with the Holy, Catholike Church, whereof <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke was the type. We ſay, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vnion is auaileable to the latter, onely <hi>ex acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente</hi>; in as much as the preſent viſible Church doth
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7910:81"/>
by doctrine and diſcipline, draw vs to a conformitie, in points of faith and other meanes neceſſary vnto ſaluation, with the ancient Catholike and Primitiue Church. This did not the viſible Romiſh Church, for diuers hundred yeeres before <hi>Luthers</hi> time: but on the contrary, ſhe did diſcompoſe or misfaſhion them from all true conformitie with the ancient Catholike Church. Howbeit, euen in the midnight of ſuperſtition and palpable darkeneſſe, which had ouerſpread the viſible Romiſh Church, there were within it, though not of it, many viſible members of the Holy, Catholike Church: men by ſo much more true and liuely members of the Holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church or Body of Chriſt, by how much they were leſſe true and actuall members of the viſible Romiſh Church; that is, by how much their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vnto the Romiſh Church repreſentatiue, or to the authority of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> was leſſe firme or none: as in a generall plague, when euery city and towne throughout the whole Kingdome, is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; they are moſt ſafe which haue ſolitarie dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the country, and haue leaſt commerce with port townes or markets. Such adherence to the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or repreſentatiue Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites and others now challenge, doth (as we haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſaid) induce a ſeparation from the Holy, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, and is more deadly to the ſoule, then to be bed-fellow to one ſicke of the peſtilence, is to the body.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He two principall points, whereon we pitch, may bee compriſed in theſe two propoſitions: the firſt, <hi>A man may be a true liue-member of the holy Catholike Church,</hi> albeit <hi>he hath no vnion or commerce with any member of the Churches viſible.</hi> And this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is cleere from that point formerly diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, how farre it was true of the viſible Church, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra eccleſiam non eſt ſalus, Out of the Church there is no ſaluation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond, <hi>A man may be a true and viſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Holy, Catholike Church, and yet be no actual member of any viſible Church.</hi> The truth of this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter propoſition, may be proued by many inſtances of moſt ages, ſince the Church (whether vnder the Law or Goſpell) became viſible. For this preſent it ſhall ſuffice to explicate the meaning of it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my former promiſe, and to confirme the truth of it ſo explicated by one or two pregnant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Albeit moſt of the termes in this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or diſtinction contained, haue beene explicated before in two inquiries; the one, <hi>what was required to the conſtitution of the Holy Catholike Church.</hi> The other, <hi>what was required to the conſtitution of a viſible Church.</hi> To what was then ſaid, I will adde onely
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7910:82"/>
thus much: That the Church may bee termed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, either in the <hi>prime</hi> ſenſe (or as we then ſayd <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,) or in a ſecondary analogicall ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>The Catholike Church in the prime ſenſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts only of ſuch men, as are actuall and indiſſoluble members of Chriſts myſticall body, or of ſuch as haue the Catholike Faith, not onely ſowne in their braines or vnderſtanding, but throughly rooted in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>In a ſecondary Analogicall ſenſe; Euery preſent viſible Church, which holdeth the Holy, Catholike faith, without which no man can bee ſaued, pure (and vndefiled with the traditions or inuentions of men;) may bee termed an Holy, Catholike Church. When we ſay, a man may be a viſible me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the holy Catholike Church, and yet no actuall member of any preſent viſible Church, we take the catholike Church in the later or ſecondary ſenſe, that is, for a Church wherein no point of faith or doctrine is maintained or allowed, which is not conſonant and homogeneall to the Catholike &amp; primitiue faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles. Who are indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble members of Chriſts bodie, is onely viſible or known to him: Many thouſands are and haue been true me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of it, which are &amp; haue been altogether inuiſible to vs. But who they be, which profeſſe the vnity of that faith, which the Apoſtles taught, and without which no man can bee ſaued, is viſible and knowne to all ſuch as either heare them profeſſe it <hi>viua voce,</hi> or can read and vnderſtand their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it giuen in writing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The truth of the ſecond propoſition may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7910:82"/>
be manifeſted hence, in as much as the vnion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the members of any Church as viſible, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the vnity of diſcipline or iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or of lawes iudiciall or ceremoniall; whereas the vnion of the Church as holy and Catholike, <hi>formally</hi> conſiſts in the vnitie of faith or doctrine, or of Lawes and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries internally ſpirituall and morall. It is cleare, that the former vnion may be diſſolued without the diſſolution of the latter, as the latter likewiſe in ſome caſes may be diſſolued without diſſolution of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. As for example, a man may be cut off by exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication or exile from all commerce with the preſent viſible Church, wherein hee was bred and borne; and yet not thereby cut off from the Holy, Catholike, orthodoxall Church. Againe, a man by hereſie or impious opinions, (whether voluntarily and ſecretly imbraced by him, or thruſt vpon him by the viſible Church which hath authority of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction ouer him) may ſeparate himſelfe from the Holy, Catholike Church; and yet ſtill remaine an actuall member, a deare ſonne of the viſible Church, in whoſe boſome he is willing to liue.</p>
                  <p>Euery viſible Church whoſe Lawes are ratified by Soueraigne Authority, and whoſe Gouernours are armed with power coactiue, may cut off any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular member; beſides the head, from which all power coactiue is deriued. Suppoſe one or two, or more be actually cut off by excommunication, exile, or the like cenſure, not onely from publike commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Church, but from all ciuill commerce with his neighbours: yet if I know, that hee was ſo cut off either vpon miſ-information, or <hi>miſtake</hi> of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7910:83"/>
his Iudges, as if he had held ſome grieuous hereſies, which as appeares to mee hee did not; or that the Church Gouernors out of ignorance, ſpleene, or faction, or other ſiniſter reſpects, which I may not in particular examine, did condemne theſe opinions held by him for hereticall or ſchiſmaticall, which are in themſelues, and to my knowledge, ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall and truly Catholike: hee is to mee and to others which know his meaning, a viſible member of the Holy, Catholike Church, though no more a member of the viſible Church wherein he did, and we yet remaine. And albeit I haue no power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcind the viſible Churches decree, or authoritatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pronounce him a Catholike, whom they, to whom the cognizance of ſuch cauſes belongs, haue condemned for an hereticke; and albeit, I may not admit him to publike prayers, or to communion at the Sacraments, as being interdicted by authoritie: yet I may and ought ſtill to retaine that communion with him which in this Creed we beleeue to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt all true members of Chriſts body, or profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Holy, Catholike faith, that is, the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints</hi>: ſuch a <hi>Communion</hi> as is betwixt the members of the Church triumphant, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing members of Chriſts body militant; or rather ſuch as is betweene the orthodoxall profeſſors of the Engliſh, or other reformed Churches. I am bound to pray for him, and he for me, that we may continue ſtedfaſt in the faith which we haue receiued from the Holy, Catholike Church of former times, from which the Gouernors of the preſent viſible Church, haue ſwearued in this particular. Of this caſe thus
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7910:83"/>
propounded in <hi>Theſi, Athanaſius</hi> his caſe was the <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> The then Church repreſentatiue or viſible <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, had condemned him in one or two generall Councells for an hereticke, and being ſo condemned he was vtterly excluded, and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cut off from all communion in things ſacred, with the viſible <hi>Church</hi> or its members, ſo long as he maintained that doctrine which it condemned. Which doctrine it is certaine, hee neither did nor would recant, whatſoeuer the then viſible Church did or might determine to the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 If either the name <hi>Catholike,</hi> or the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by it, be to be valued for the time preſent, by the multitude of ſuffragants, or number of ſuffrages giuen <hi>ex cathedra; Athanaſius</hi> and his followers were no more Catholiks, then <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> and <hi>Hus</hi> with their followers in their times, were; For one Biſhop that did maintaine or fauour <hi>Athanaſius</hi> doctrine, there were more then forty did oppugne it. And yet he boldly pronounceth that the faith profeſſed by him, was the onely true, Catholike faith, without which no man could be ſaued, which whoſoeuer did not keepe holy and vndefiled, was to periſh euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly. Suppoſe not ten in all the Chriſtian world beſides, had reſolutely imbraced the ſame faith which <hi>Athanaſius</hi> did ſo much magnifie: or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all (were they more or few) which did imbrace or profeſſe it, had beene with him condemned for heretikes, and vtterly cut off from all communion with the viſible Church, all either baniſhed into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Hands, or ſhut vp into ſeuerall priſons: all this notwithſtanding, they had ſtill remained the onely true viſible members of the Holy, catholike Church,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7910:84"/>
which theſe times afforded. And for this reaſon were they to bee accounted the onely true viſible members of the Holy, Catholike Church, becauſe they onely were contented, rather to be cut off from the preſent viſible church, then to communicate with it in ſuch doctrines or opinions, as either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict or defile the chatholike primitiue faith.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 That which ſome Romaniſts in this point re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, to wit, that <hi>Iulius</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> did not conſent to <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his condemnation, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him in his exile; may for ought I know, or at this preſent haue to ſay againſt it, bee as true in part, as it is impertinent. Sure I am, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> did not ſo reſolutely and manfully oppoſe the Arian faction, or the then erring viſible Church, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> did. That confeſſion of the catholike faith, which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelfe retaineth in her Lyturgy, as a <hi>Trophie</hi> of the victory, which the catholike faith in the iſſue obtained ouer the potent Arian hereſie, was neither conceiued, publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, nor commended to the Chriſtian world, by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but by the exiled <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> This worthy Biſhop ſaw almoſt all the Prelates in the world beſides, for the preſent, to bee ſet againſt him. How theſe, or their ſucceſſors, or ſuch as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued after him, would be affected, he knew not; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the truth of his doctrine, hee cared not, as being confident, that his doctrine was truly catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and authenticke, without the ratification or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall of the then Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> or his ſucceſſors, or of any viſible church ſucceeding: he knew Chriſts Apoſtles and their immediate ſucceſſors had imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it. For ſuch as liued with him, or were to come
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7910:84"/>
after him, at their perills be it, if they imbrace it not. Though not ten of that age, or any age after him, were to be ſaued; yet of theſe few, not one, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts, could otherwiſe bee ſaued, then by beleeuing, as he did, and as former Saints of God had done.</p>
                  <p>If the then Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> did receiue <hi>Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in the name of an Orthodox or Catholike, and bid <hi>God ſpeed</hi> vnto his labours; all that can hence be inferred, is this, That <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> a viſible member of the holy, catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, and the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> a viſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſame church to <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> But neither of them, not both of them, the then viſible church, nor any members of it.</p>
                  <p>As many as after this time became true members of the holy, catholike Church, became not ſuch by holding vnion with the then viſible Church, but by adherence to that catholike faith, which <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and other viſible members of the holy, catholike Church then taught. The holy catholike militant Church, hath continued one and the ſame ſince its Foundation, not by continuation of one and the ſame viſible Church, but by continuation of one and the ſame catholike &amp; Apoſtolike faith throughout al ages, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> faith hath been ſometimes maintained but ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oppugned by churches viſible or repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tatiue.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 It is one thing to ſay, the Holy, catholike Church hath beene in all ages viſible, another thing to ſay, the viſible Church hath beene in all ages ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike: We may and ought to grant; that in euery age ſince the Apoſtles time, there haue beene many not onely true but viſible members of the one, holy,

The word preached by them likewiſe, hath the force and efficacie of beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting faith in their Hearers hearts: &amp; ſo long as they teach nothing but what Chriſt hath taught, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or laity owe the like obedience vnto them, that the people of the Iewes, in our Sauiours time, owed to the Scribes and Phariſees. For though perhaps they haue in many points degenerated much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from S. <hi>Peters</hi> doctrine and manner of life, then the Scribes and Phariſees had done from <hi>Moſes</hi>; yet ſo long as they ſit in <hi>Peters</hi> or other catholike Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops <hi>chaires,</hi> that precept of our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.3</note> [<hi>Illos au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, heare ye them,</hi>] binds <hi>them</hi> as much as it did the Iewes. How farre it bound the Iewes, I leaue it to

the Expoſitors of the 23. of S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> and amongſt the reſt to <hi>Maldonat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 It is certaine, the people were not by vertue of this precept bound to doe all that their high Prieſt with his confederates would <hi>ex cathedra</hi> command them to doe, though intended by them, <hi>in ordine ad Deum &amp; ſalutem Eccleſiae,</hi> with reference to God, and to the welfare of his Church. For <hi>Caiaphas</hi> had deliuered this ſentence <hi>ex cathedra, It is expedient for vs that one man die for the people, and that the whole nation periſh not.</hi> Iohn 11. ver. 49. And vpon his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or warrant, they aduentured to put the Lord of glory to death. Had not this falſe Apoſtaticall Prieſt, beene <hi>in vero ſacerdotio,</hi> a chiefe officer in the houſe of God; neither could ſo cleer a truth as he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, haue beene inuerted to ſuch a pernitious end, as it was ſpoken by him, &amp; apprehended by others; nor could hee haue conceiued or vttered ſo cleare a truth of himſelfe, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> inſtructs vs he did. <hi>This he ſpake not of himſelfe: but being high Prieſt that ſame yeer, he propheſied that Ieſus ſhould die for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Ioh. 11.51. Other Acts of his prieſthood tooke their validity from his office, not from his perſon: this ſpeculatiue truth tooke its poyſonous operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from his perſon, not from his office; although he could not haue borne ſo bitter enmity vnto Chriſt, vnleſſe he had beene in that office.</p>
                  <p>Now albeit we grant that <hi>Caiaphas</hi> did propheſie by vertue of his place or Prieſtly office, yet no Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts (as I hope) will deny, that <hi>Caiaphas</hi> in the prepoſterous application of his propheticall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, might well brooke the name of Antichriſt; at
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7910:90"/>
the leaſt that hee was a type or ſhadow of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt to come; who was to ſit as <hi>Caiaphas</hi> did in the Temple of God, or if ſo they will haue it, in S. <hi>Peters</hi> chaire, that hee may wreſt diuine truths authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely to as wicked ends, as <hi>Caiaphas</hi> did.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 But may it not hence bee inferred, that as the Sanedrin was the onely viſible Church, which God had here on earth; ſo the Romiſh Church from which <hi>Luther</hi> did ſeparate himſelfe, was the onely true viſible Church of Chriſt, at the time of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration? This may be granted <hi>de facto,</hi> but not <hi>de iure.</hi> For there was an expreſſe Law of God, that there ſhould be no more viſible Churches, then one, before our Sauiours death and reſurrection; after which there were to bee as many viſible Churches <hi>de iure,</hi> as there were ſeuerall independent Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignties. I haue heard indeed of ſome French Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes (as they would bee accounted) which vſe this as an argument, whether intended by them, <hi>ad homines,</hi> to delude the obiecter onely, or <hi>ad rem,</hi> to the matter it ſelfe, I know not: But this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they vſe, to proue that their Church (as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Reformed Churches) is the true Church, becauſe the Pope is Antichriſt, &amp; Antichriſt (as the Apoſtle teacheth) is to ſit in the Temple of God, and the Temple of God, no queſtion, is the true Church; whence ſeeing hee ſits in their Church, they inferre that theirs is the true Church, not ours. But as in moſt other arguments concerning the Church, ſo in this they cozen themſelues with the fallacy, <hi>à dicto ſecundùm quid, ad dictum ſimpliciter.</hi> Firſt both letter of Scripture and analogie of faith,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7910:91"/>
doe teach, that Antichriſt is to ſit as <hi>Caiaphas</hi> did, in a true Church, yea to be a chiefe Officer of ſome Church: otherwiſe he could not be a principal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell or notorious Traitor againſt Chriſt. But in that he was to be ſuch a rebell and ſuch a Traitor, it is not conceiuable, that the Church which wholly ſubmits herſelfe to him, as to her head, ſhould bee the true Church, much leſſe the onely Church of Chriſt. The former argument will hold thus farre, The Pope is Antichriſt; <hi>ergo,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a true Church <hi>ſecundùm quid,</hi> that is in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Synagogue of Iewes, of Turkes, or other profeſſed Infidels: But if we ſpeake abſolutely, or compare it with Churches truly Chriſtian, it is no true Church of Chriſt, but the Synagogue of Satan. Or, as he ſaid of his ſordid Hoſts entertainment, that there was ſo much fire, as a man could not haue tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid in ſtrict propriety of logicke phraſe, there was no fire; that is, there was ſo much, as if hee had beene bound by couenant of Leaſe, neuer to haue ſuffered the fire to goe out, hee might haue ſaued his leaſe from forfeiture: and yet there was no fire but a mocke-fire to the entertaining of a ſtranger; ſo much, as was a greater eyeſore to him that had ſought comfort or refreſhing from it, then if there had been none at all. In like manner there is ſo much of the true Church in the preſent Romiſh viſible Church, as a man cannot ſay, it is no Church at all; ſo much true doctrine in it, as ſufficeth to ſupport the title of Antichriſt, and to make it the very ſeat of all abominations or impieties more then natural. For as the mingling of the Traditions of men with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:7910:91"/>
doctrine, did make the leuen of Phariſes to be ſo malignant and diſtaſtfull to God and all good men; ſo is it the mixture or making vp of the doctrine of Chriſt and of Deuills, in one and the ſame Liturgy, which makes Antichriſtianiſme in graine. And as <note n="*" place="margin">In the third book vpon the Creed, Sect. 3. and 4 in diuers Chapters.</note>elſwhere is obſerued, the Idolatry of the Romiſh Church, is ſo much worſe then the Idolatry of the Heathens, by how much that Churches generall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of one God, of the glorious Trinity, and of the redemption of mankind, is better then the Heathens beliefe or knowledge of the ſame points.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 But when it is ſaid that Antichriſt is to ſit in the Temple of God, it is not meant onely that hee ſhould ſit in the preſent viſible Church, but that he ſhould be an vſurper of that <hi>chaire</hi> which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had beene the ſeat of Gods Saints, and bee an intruder into that Church, which had beene Holy and Catholike before his intruſion, and which ſtill retaines the rootes and ſtemmes of Catholike faith, into which it ſhall be his and his followers continual care, to ingraffe the doctrine of Deuills, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their ſpirituall whoredomes in the Oratories of God.</p>

and <hi>Zedekiah.</hi> As at this day againe, it is the fault and folly of Chriſtian Kings, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not either reduced to better conformity with the holy, Catholike and Apoſtolike Church, or elſe demoliſhed as the Iewiſh Synagogue was.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhould moue this <hi>man,</hi> I meane the Author of the blind <hi>Guide of Faith,</hi> to make the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer obiection againſt vs, I cannot conceiue; vnleſſe it were to giue vs and the Chriſtian world to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, <hi>That the viſible Romiſh Church his mother, could bee very well content to continue, till Chriſts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond comming, as erroneous and antichriſtian as the Iewiſh Synagogue was before his firſt comming in the fleſh; vpon condition ſhe may retaine her wonted power and authority to tyrannize ouer vs and other Saints of God, as the viſible Iewiſh Church or Synagogue did oft-times ouer the true Prophets and Chriſts diſciples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 For concluſion of this point; In as much as Chriſtian Princes and free States did ſecond <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in his intended reformation of ſo much of the viſible Romiſh-Church, as was ſeated in their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignties or Dominions; this warrants our ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to haue beene iuſt and lawfull, and free from all ſuſpition of rebellion or ſchiſme; whereunto the like attempts in <hi>Iury,</hi> though vndertaken by Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, had beene obnoxious, vnleſſe the Princes or chiefe Magiſtrates had giuen them countenance and authority. Howbeit neither Prince nor people ioyntly or ſeuerally, either now haue, or at any time had power to make a new church altogether diſtinct from the Catholike Church militant on earth, which hath beene one by continuation of the ſame
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7910:93"/>
                     <hi>faith,</hi> ſince the Apoſtles time. But in caſe any part of the Church militant or viſible, be infected with he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, or ouerſwaid by faction, to approue ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and vngodly practices as are incompatible with the Holy, Catholike faith, which hath beene profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in pure and vncorrupt times: euery free Prince or State, haue in this caſe power and authority ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, to diſlinke themſelues from the factious combination of the viſible Church or Churches ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in forraigne States or Kingdomes, and to vnite themſelues into renewed formes of viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, diſtinct from others. Yet thus to doe, ſo they doe no more, is not to make a new Church neuer heard of before, but rather to recollect the ſcattered members of the Holy, Catholike Church, in whom the life and ſubſtance of the true Church of God conſiſts, and to put a new accidentall forme vpon them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The caſe is altogether the ſame, as if an Army conſiſting of threeſcore thouſand <hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> appointed by ioynt conſent of theſe Nations, to inuade the Turke, ſhould bee miſled by the <hi>Italian</hi> Generall, to reuenge his priuate quarrels vpon the Chriſtians. If the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> vpon diſcouery of their Generals trecherie, ſhould abandon him, and adioyne themſelues vnto the <hi>Hungarians</hi> or other Chriſtians oppreſſed by the Turke; they could not iuſtly be blamed, either for defection or reuolt, or for leuying an Armie, or vndertaking a warre alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether new, without any warrant or commiſſion. Well might they preſume their Prince would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue their proceedings, ſpecially if their ſeruice
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7910:94"/>
had ſucceſſe anſwerable to the godly intentions of their firſt Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 As many of our forefathers as did ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto the Iuriſdiction of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and vndertook ſuch ſeruices as the Pope or Romane Prelacie did appoint them vnto; they did thus onely vpon preſumption, that the Pope did faithfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his Commiſſion as the Apoſtles ſucceſſor, or that he did command in <hi>chiefe</hi> for Chriſt. But when the contrary was notoriouſly knowne vnto this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that hee did but counterfeit the viſage of the Lambe, that he might the more plauſibly effect the deſignes of the Dragon: Our Prince and people, in abandoning his yoke, and breaking off their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie with the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> did well. And this being done, they remaine the ſame church they were for life and ſubſtance, but the ſame Church better purified and purged from rebellious Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian humours, the ſame Church ſo much more homogeneall to the ancient Primitiue catholike Church, by how much they remained the freer from ſeruitude to Romiſh tyranny, whoſe vſurped authority ouer other Churches, is but Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſme or Apoſtaſie from Chriſt.</p>

This for one, That our forefathers at the time of their departure from the Romiſh Church, were true Catholikes, or, in the <hi>interim</hi> betweene the abandoning of the Prelacie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing a Prelacie or forme of Gouernment of their owne more refined, were viſible members of the holy, Catholike Church. For ſo deſtitute is the Romane Church of all true &amp; ſolid properties of the true Church of God, that ſhe is faine to plead the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>title</hi> of <hi>Catholike,</hi> to be her proper <hi>note</hi> or Enſigne, which no other Church may more preſume to challenge, then a Seruingman may preſume to weare his Maſters coate or cognizance, after hee be diſcharged of his ſeruice.

                  <p n="2">2 If the power of laughing proceede from the nature of man, and the nature of man conſiſt in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: it will bee very hard for any man to refraine laughing, that hath but ſo much reaſon as to conſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der the vanitie of this aſſertion, <hi>that a name ſhould be an vnſeparable propertie proceeding from the nature of any realitie.</hi> God gaue names to the firſt Man, and to the firſt Woman, and the firſt man gaue names befitting other creatures: but the names proceeded not from the nature of the creatures named, but from the Impoſers; otherwiſe their names ſhould haue beene the ſame in all nations and languages.

naturall. If the reall propertie anſwering to this name had belonged to the Romiſh Church, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt would haue expreſt it by a Romane name, and haue called the Romane Church, the <hi>vniverſall Church,</hi> at leaſt the Romaniſts ſhould haue called themſelues <hi>vniuerſals,</hi> not <hi>Catholikes.</hi> But let vs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten againe vnto this Rauer. <hi>Wee onely inioy the liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly badge, and are inueſted with the Liuerie of the true profeſſors of Chriſt.

inſtile themſelues, to be Iewes. Yet doe we not for all this, beleeue that the Iewiſh Nation is the <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> of Nations, or the onely choſen people of God now on earth.

                  <p>Were <hi>Vincentius</hi> his rules as artificiall, as they are orthodoxall and honeſt, the iſſue betwixt vs and the Romaniſt would be very eaſie and triable.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Firſt concerning <hi>vniuerſality,</hi> the queſtion is not, Whether at this preſent houre, or in any former age for theſe thouſand yeeres paſt, there are or haue been more, which profeſſe the preſent <hi>Romiſh Religion</hi> eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; then the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion eſtabliſhed in the reformed Churches ſince the ſeparation was made.

The multitude of voices thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for them, may proue their faction to be ſtronger and greater than our Church; it cannot proue their faith to be ſo vniuerſall as our faith is. The fallacie by which the Romaniſts deceiue poore ſimple peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is in making them beleeue, that our Religion and their Religion, our faith and their faith are <hi>duo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma diuerſa,</hi> or ſo totally diſtinct, that part of the one could not be included in the other. But for the <hi>vniuerſalitie</hi> of our faith wee haue euery member of the Romiſh Church a ſuffragant or witneſſe for vs.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7910:98"/>
Firſt, nothing is held as a point of faith in our Church, but the preſent Romiſh Church doth hold the ſame, and confeſſe the ſame to haue beene held by all orthodoxall Antiquity. So that for the <hi>forme</hi> of faith eſtabliſhed in our Church, we haue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Primitiue Church, of the foure firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels, of all ſucceding ages vnto this preſent day, the conſent likewiſe of the preſent Romiſh Church, and of our ſelues. Now as <hi>France</hi> is a great deale bigger than <hi>Normandy,</hi> if we compare them as diſtinct and oppoſite; and yet <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Normandy</hi> is bigger then <hi>France</hi> without <hi>Normandy:</hi> ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe though the preſent viſible Romiſh Church be much greater then the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Romiſh Church, how great ſoeuer, doth hold all the points of faith which our Church doth, for <hi>Catholike</hi> and orthodoxall; our conſent, and their conſent, our confeſſion and their confeſſion, is more vniuerſall then their conſent without ours. But if their conſent vnto the points of faith beleeued by vs, proue our faith to be vniuerſall, and our Church by conſequence to bee <hi>Catholike</hi>; why ſhould not our conſent vnto the points of faith beleeued by them, proue their faith to bee vniuerſall, or their Church to be <hi>Catholike?</hi> Becauſe it is not enough, to hold all points of <hi>Catholike</hi> faith, vnleſſe the ſame points bee kept <hi>holy and vndefiled.</hi> The Romiſh Church, we grant, doth hold all points of Catholike faith, and ſo farre as ſhe holds theſe points, wee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent not from her: yet diſſent from her wee doe in that ſhe hath <hi>defiled</hi> and polluted the catholike faith, with new and poyſonous doctrines; for which ſhee
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7910:98"/>
neither hath the conſent of Antiquity, nor of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches. And in reſpect of theſe doctrines, ſhe ſtands conuicted of ſchiſme and hereſie, by <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> his rules. For it is with him a fundamentall rule, That no preſent viſible Church, hath any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to commend any thing as a point of faith to poſterity, which hath not beene commended to the ſaid Church by Antiquity deriued from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times. A proficiency or growth in faith, hee allowes and granteth, <hi>modò ſit in eodem genere, ſo it be in the ſame kinde, or proceed from the ſame root:</hi> but for additions or new inuentions, he takes them for the markes of ſchiſme and hereſie.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 So then we hold the Catholike faith, and they hold the Catholike faith. And ſeeing they hold the Catholike faith in the ſame meaſure that we doe, is it not reaſon they ſhould bee termed Catholikes as well as we, though not ſo good Chatholikes as wee? No reaſon they ſhould be termed Catholikes at all. Where is the difference? In this. Wee hold it <hi>pure and vndefiled,</hi> they haue defiled and polluted it for many generations, and doe ſtill defile it with many loathſome additions and inuentions. Now in this caſe the denomination followeth the worſer part, that is, they are not ſo much to bee reputed Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes for that they hold the Catholike faith, as to be adiudged Heretikes and Schiſmatiks, becauſe they haue defiled and polluted it with many new inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and being admoniſhed hereof and reproued, will not purifie their faith, will not reforme their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion according to the rule of faith and the practice of Antiquity. Their faith not purified from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7910:99"/>
of the ſecond <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> Councell, can be no Catholike faith. Their Religion not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, can be no true Religion, ſaue onely in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>Paganiſme, Iudaiſme</hi> or <hi>Mahumetiſme.</hi> For as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Bonum non eſt niſi ex integra cauſa, malum ex quolibet defectu, Nothing is good which is not intire and ſound, evill ariſeth from euery defect.</hi> Euery new addition or inuention in matters of faith or doctrine, is enough to make that church ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall, which before was Catholike and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall. Catholike and orthodoxall no Church can be, vnleſſe it hold all points of faith without admix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of humane inuentions or of new articles. The admixture of a great deale of mans meat with a little ſwines meat, makes the whole diſh to bee no mans meat, but ſwines meat. Our Church according to, <hi>Vincentius</hi> his rule admits a growth or proficiencie in faith, in that it holds not only thoſe propoſitions which are expreſly contained in Scripture, but ſuch as may by neceſſary conſequence bee deduced out of them, for points of faith, and this growth is ſtill <hi>in eodem genere,</hi> from the ſame root. Other points of faith beſides theſe, our Church admitteth none, but tyes euen her Prelates and Gouernours to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude no other doctrines as points of faith, vpon their Auditors, than ſuch as are either expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scriptures, or may infallibly bee deduced from them. And this is the fundamentall and radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call difference between our Church and the Romiſh Church, which admitteth ſuch an illimited increaſe or growth of faith as is in heapes or congeſts of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogenealls.</p>

                  <p n="3">3 The ſecond addition made by the Romane Church vnto the ancient canon of faith, is, a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent one, and illimited; and that is, the making of Eccleſiaſticall Tradition to be an integrall part of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7910:101"/>
the canon of faith. This doth not onely pollute, but vndermine the whole fabricke of the holy, primitiue and Catholike faith. That there is a certaine <hi>rule</hi> or authentick canon of faith, is a principle, wherein the ancient primitiue Church, the moderne Roman, and all reformed Churches agree. The firſt point of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt vs, is about the extent of the written canon, ſpecially of the old Teſtament. The maine points of difference are theſe. Firſt, we affirme with antiquity, and in particular with <hi>Vincentius Lirinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> that the canon of Scripture is a rule of faith, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect for quantity, and ſufficient for qualitie: that is, it containes all things in it, that are neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, or requiſite to be contained in any rule; &amp; ſo containes them as they may be beleeued and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>out relying on any other rule or authority equivalent to them in certainty, or more authentick in reſpect of vs, then the Scriptures are. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Romiſh Church denies the canon of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to bee perfect and compleat in reſpect of its quantity, or ſufficient for its quality or efficacy. To ſupply the defect of its quantity, they adde Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as another part of the ſame rule, homogeneall and equiualent to it for quality. To ſupply the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency aſwell of canonicall Scriptures as of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in reſpect of their <hi>quality</hi> or <hi>efficacy</hi> towards vs, they adde the infallible authority of the preſent viſible Church. The former addition of vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Traditions, as part of the infallible rule doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine: this latter addition of the Churches infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible &amp; abſolute authority aſwell in determining the extent, as in declaring the true ſenſe and meaning of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7910:101"/>
the whole rule, vtterly puls downe the ſtructure of faith: yet when we reiect Eccleſiaſticall Tradition from being any part of the rule of faith, we doe not altogether deny the authority or vſe of it. Howbeit that Eccleſiaſticall Tradition, wherof there was ſuch excellent vſe in the Primitiue Church, was not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written tradition, or cuſtomes commended or rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the ſuppoſed infallibility of any viſible Church. That Eccleſiaſtical Tradition which <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Lirinenſis</hi> ſo much commends, did eſpecially conſiſt in the Confeſſions or regiſters of particular Churches. Now the vnanimous conſent of ſo many ſeuerall Churches, as exhibited their Confeſſions to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell, being not dependent one of another, not ouerſwayed by authority, nor miſled by faction to frame the Confeſſions of their faith by imitation, or according to ſome patterne ſet them, but voluntarily and freely exhibiting ſuch Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as had beene framed and taught before theſe controuerſies aroſe; was a pregnant argument to any vnpartiall vnderſtanding man, that this faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they all agreed, had beene deliuered vnto them by the Apoſtles and their followers, by the firſt planters of the Churches thus agreeing; a pregnant argument likewiſe, that theſe firſt planters had beene inſpired and taught by one and the ſame Spirit. Each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church was a competent or authentike wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of euery other Churches integrity and fidelity <hi>in ſeruando depoſitum, in carefull preſeruing the truth committed to their ſpeciall truſt.</hi> On the contrary, in that <hi>Arius, Eutyches, Neſtorius,</hi> and other heretikes, did obtrude ſuch conſtructions of ſcriptures vpon
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7910:102"/>
their Auditors, as had no where beene heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but ſprung vp with themſelues, or from the places wherein they liued: this was an argument more then probable, that if the Apoſtles had deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the whole forme of wholeſome doctrine vnto poſteritie (a point queſtioned by no Church in thoſe times) theſe men, or the particular Churches which abetted them, had not kept the doctrine deliuered vnto them by our Sauiour and his Apoſtles; but had corrupted or defiled it with the idle fancies of their owne braines, or with the muddy conceit of their diſcontented paſſions.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeake more briefly, though perhaps more fully: The vnanimous conſent of ſo many diſtinct viſible Churches, as exhibited their ſeuerall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, Catechiſmes, or Teſtimonies of their owne and their forefathers faith, vnto the foure firſt oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenicall Councels, was an argument of the ſame force and efficacie, againſt <hi>Arius</hi> and other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, for whoſe conuiction theſe Councels were called, as the generall conſent and practice of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in worſhipping ſome Diuine power or other, hath beene, in all ages, againſt the Atheiſts. Nothing, beſides the ingraffed notion of a Deitie or diuine power, could haue inclined ſo many ſeuerall Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo much different in naturall diſpoſition, in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill diſcipline and education, to affect or practice the dutie of adoration. Nothing, beſides the euidence of truth deliuered vnto the Chriſtian world by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, could haue kept ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral Churches, as communicated their Confeſſions vnto the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Epheſus,</hi> &amp;c. in the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7910:102"/>
of the ſame faith.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Howbeit this vnanimous Tradition Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticke, was not in theſe times held for any proper part of the Rule of faith, but alleadged onely as an inducement to incline the hearts of ſuch as before acknowledged the written word for the onely Rule of faith, to beleeue that the interpretations or deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of thoſe Councels, did containe the true ſenſe and meaning of the Rule acknowledged by all. So that the written Tradition which <hi>Vincentius</hi> ſo much commends, was not by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell vſed to any ſuch purpoſe as the Romaniſt now vſe vnwritten Traditions. The onely vſe of it was to direct the preſent Church in her examination of the Catholike truth, or points of faith. The chiefe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which the viſible Church then challenged, did conſiſt in the vnanimous conſent of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke Tradition, and that (as was ſaid before) but an inducement to imbrace the interpretations of the preſent Church, and reiect the interpretations of vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart heretikes.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 But was it a receiued truth in theſe Primitiue times, or a truth acknowledged by <hi>Vicentius,</hi> (the pretended patron of Roman Catholike Tradition) that the ioynt conſent of ſo many Biſhops, as were aſſembled in the firſt Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> or the ioynt Confeſſions of ſo many ſeuerall Dioceſſes as were then deliuered to that Councell, ſhould vnto the worlds end, continue an argument or inducement of like force or validitie, as it then was, either for eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Canons which ſucceeding Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels ſhould make, or for condemning ſuch opinions
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7910:103"/>
as with the conſent of as many (or more) Biſhops, as were there aſſembled, ſhould be condemned for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies?

And the Romane church, being fleſht with the ſpoile of Chriſts flocke and chriſtian chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches through the Weſt, haue not beene wanting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelues in deuiſing new opportunities in coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a new art of falſifying Antiquitie, of ſtealing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7910:103"/>
the conſent and ſuffrages of the chriſtian world, from orthodoxall and primitiue truth. So that if this controuerſie may be examined and diſcuſſed by <hi>Vincentius</hi> his rules, <hi>ſince</hi> the firſt acknowledgment of the <hi>Popes ſupremacie,</hi> ſince the making of Edicts for the acknowledging of it, ſince the <hi>exemption</hi> of Clarkes from royall or ciuill iuriſdiction; all the written teſtimonies, or vnwritten traditions, which the children of the Romiſh church doe or can rake together, are voyd in law, and voyd in conſcience: there is not ſo much as one legall ſingle Teſtimony, but all are as a multitude of falſe and illegall witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, of parties or conſpirators in their owne cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 But although hereſies of long ſtanding &amp; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance cannot be refuted, nor may not be aſſaulted in <hi>Vincentius</hi> his iudgement, by the former method; that is, by multitude of ſuffragants, or ioynt conſent of ſeuerall Prouinces: is there therefore no other meanes left to conuince them, no way left to eſchew them? yes, we may <hi>eſchew them,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy condemned by ancient and orthodoxall Councels</hi>; or we may <hi>conuince them, ſo it be needfull or expedient, by the ſole authority of Scriptures.</hi> Now if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be ſufficient <hi>to conuince</hi> hereſies of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance or long ſtanding, and to confute ſuch here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, as want neither wit, will, nor opportunitie to falſifie ancient records, and imprint traditions of their owne coyning, with inſcriptions of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; I hope the ſame Scripture was (in <hi>Vincentius</hi> his iudgement) a Rule of faith neither vncompleate for its quantitie, nor vnſufficient for its qualitie: a Rule euery way competent for ending controuerſies in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,

without the aſſumption either of Tradition or decrees of Councell, as any aſſociates or homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneall parts of the ſame rule.</p>

Into the ſame truths which theſe Councels were then, wee now are led, not by relying vpon the ſole authority of the Councels which the Spirit did lead, but by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their footſteps, and viewing the way by which the Spirit did lead them.

the others daughter, and intended to marry a ſecond wife in a forraigne Country, where the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty grieued had no Chriſtian Magiſtrate to doe him right. An heathen Iudge, that could vnderſtand the literall meaning of the Scripture, though he did not in any ſort beleeue them, and made no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Polygamie himſelfe, might in this caſe giue as vpright iudgement, as the Pope and his Cardinals could, and that according to the rule of faith; ſo the parties would both ſubmit themſelues to haue the controuerſie decided by <hi>that</hi> rule, that is, by the Scriptures of the old and new Teſtament.

If the party grieued ſhould againſt cuſtome and tradition, plead or oppoſe that law, <hi>Let every man haue his wife, and euery wife her husband,</hi> or other like Texts, which ſome great Diuines haue alleaged for deciſion of this caſe; they would not conclude the cauſe, ſpecially before a Iudge not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the myſtery of the Creation. For he that hath <hi>a wife and a wife, hath a wife, and ſhee that hath a husband, and a husband, hath a husband.</hi> But if that precept of our <note place="margin">Mat. 19.9.</note> Sauiour, [<hi>Whoſoeuer putteth away his wife vnleſſe it bee for adulterie, and marieth another, committeth adultery: and hee that marieth her being ſo put away, committeth adultery:</hi>] were once produced; any Heathen Ciuilian might giue this abſolute and infallible ſentence, [<hi>If yee

Chriſtians will admit this Law for true and iuſt, or for a rule of conſcience; then Polygamy certainly is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall part of Adultery, and hee that hath a wife and marieth another, is to bee puniſhed as an Adulterer.</hi>] For what is the reaſon why he that putteth away his wife, though by legall diuorce, and marieth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, commits adultery with the ſecond? or why he that marieth the firſt being ſo put away, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe an Adulterer? Is not the reaſon becauſe the bond of matrimonie betwixt the husband and the firſt wife, according to this your Chriſtian law is not diſſolued by a legall ſentence of diuorce, <hi>extra caſum adulterij,</hi> vnleſſe in caſe of adultery? Yet as a ſentence of diuorce gotten vpon ſuſpicion of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or ſubornation, or vpon other cauſes which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Lawes, and Gods Law vnto the Iew did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; cannot by the Evangelicall Law altogether diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue the bond of matrimony: ſo out of all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it doth rather looſen or weaken it, than corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or knit it faſter. Wherefore if hee that hauing gotten a ſentence of diuorce, by formall courſe of Law, againſt his wife, become guilty of Adultery in the Court of conſcience, and by the Euangelicall Law, if hee marry another: then much more ſhall he be an Adulterer, who hauing a wife whoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity was neuer called in queſtion, againſt whom no ſentence of Law hath beene obtained, if he ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to marry another.

Kingdome worſe affected, I will not ſay towards vs and our Religion, but towards truth it ſelfe, euen towards the light of the Goſpell, than any ciuill Heathen either are or can be; they might as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerne the vſurped authority of the Romiſh Church, ouer their faith, and ouer Scriptures the rule of faith, to be as true a branch of Apoſtaſie from Chriſt, as Polygamy is of Adultery; and that it doth more euidently diſſolue the bonds of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony betwixt Chriſt and his Spouſe the Church, than Polygamy or adulterie doth the bond of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie, betwixt man and wife. Firſt, they make the Scriptures, as was ſaid before, not onely an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect rule in reſpect of its <hi>quantity,</hi> but this defect being in their opinion ſupplyed by aſſociating vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Traditions vnto it; in the ſecond place they make both Scriptures and vnwritten Traditions to bee an vnſufficient rule in reſpect of their <hi>quality.</hi> For it is their doctrine, that we cannot know which be Canonicall Scriptures, which are not, which be authenticke traditions, which not, but by relying vpon the authority of the viſible Church. Againe, admitting the Church could determine, which were Authenticke Traditions, which were not, and that no Traditions ſhould hereafter be receiued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe which ſhee had <hi>determined:</hi> yet if any controuerſie ſhould ariſe concerning the meaning of thoſe Scriptures, which ſhe hath determined to be Canonicall, or concerning the meaning, limitation or vſe of theſe Traditions which ſhee hath acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be authentike; no priuate man may take vpon him abſolutely to beleeue this or that to be the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7910:107"/>
meaning of either, but with ſubmiſſion of his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Churches ſentence. And this, as I haue <note n="*" place="margin">In the third book vpon the Creed, ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the fourth. See ſection the ſecond, ca. 2.3.4.</note> elſwhere ſhewed at large, is not onely to make the authority of the Church to bee aboue the authority of the Scriptures, but vtterly to nullifie the authority of the Scriptures, ſaue onely ſo farre as they may ſerue as a ſtale or footſtoole to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or hold vp the authority of the Church or Pope. So that the laſt reſolution of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts beliefe, as out of their owne compariſons of the Scriptures to <hi>colours,</hi> and the authority of the Church vnto the <hi>light</hi> by which colours become viſible to vs (as <note n="*" place="margin">In the booke fore cited, ſect. 4. cap. 5. par. 12.</note> is elſewhere demonſtrated) muſt be this; <hi>That he abſolutely beleeues onely the infallible authority of the Church concerning the truth of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and their true meaning:</hi> their truth or mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he neither abſolutely nor infallibly beleeues. So that, if he beleeue any diuine truth, it is onely <hi>ex ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidenti,</hi> that is, in as much as the Church doth not erre in that point of faith, which ſhe propoſeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: howbeit to beleeue that which is true, vpon no better <hi>motiue</hi> or condition then this, is much worſe then the ignorance of truth, or meer vnbeliefe of the ſame truth. How many ſeuerall diuine truths or articles of faith ſoeuer he thus beleeueth; hee can be no true Catholike, becauſe he beleeues no diuine truth, but as it is mixt with helliſh antichriſtian falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.

                  <p n="4">4 If one being a Chriſtian ſhall ſteale, hee doth commit a grieuous ſinne, yet a ſinne of one kinde or ſpecies, that is <hi>theft:</hi> he doth not thereby ceaſe to be a Chriſtian, he doth not thereby become an Infidell or Antichriſtian. The like wee may ſay of fornication, adultery, murder, inceſt, or the like, all which are grieuous ſinnes, and without repentance exclude men from the Kingdome of Heauen. Yet can wee not ſay, that they make a man an Infidell, though worthy to be caſt out of the Church, vntill hee giue full proofe of his humble ſubmiſſion and hearty repentance for his fact. But if any man that hath beene baptized and made a partaker of the word, which in many points hee beleeues, ſhall by couetouſneſſe, malice, intemperancie, or the like, haue ſo farre corrupted the feeds of Chriſtianity, or Law of God written in his heart; as he ſhall thinke, that which indeed and truth is theft, fornication, adultery, murder, or inceſt, to be no ſinne, he is by the generall verdict of the Schooles, not onely an hereticke, but an Infidell. Now Infidelitie is of two ſorts, either <hi>infidelitas purae negationis,</hi> priuatiue infidelity, ſuch as is in the Heathen, which haue not knowne God or his Lawes, as hauing no commerce with his people; or <hi>infidelitas prauae diſpoſitionis,</hi> depraued infidelity, of which there bee more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; as firſt it may bee in the Heathen to whom
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7910:109"/>
the truth of the Law or Goſpell hath beene im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted; but they haue impugned both, or had them in deriſion: or it may bee in the Iew, which acknowledgeth the truth of Moſaicall and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall writings, and yet oppugnes the truth of the Goſpell, which is contayned in them, with greater ſpight and violence, then the Heathen which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge neither. Briefly, as the contrarietie is greateſt, which is betwixt oppoſite qualities of neereſt alliance in predicamentall line; ſuch as haue the ſame immediate or <hi>proximum genus:</hi> ſo is their infidelity or enmity vnto the Catholike faith moſt deadly, which communicate with true Catholikes in moſt principles, and yet ſwarue groſly from them, and from the truth, in ſome particular prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or practices thereon grounded. As, for an Heathen to hold murther, or inceſt, to be no ſinne, is not a crime ſo haynous, as the like in a Iew: For a Iew to licence or authorize inceſtuous mariages, to allow or reward the murther of Chriſtians, for whom Chriſt ſhed his blood, includes not ſo great an enmitie vnto Chriſt and his Lawes; it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues not ſo high a degree of infidelity, as the like practice or opinions doe in him, that profeſſeth himſelfe to bee a Chriſtian, to bee a ſucceſſour of Chriſts Apoſtles, to bee Chriſts Vicar here on earth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 To proue our intended concluſion by full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; firſt, let inquirie be made what pillage and ſpoiles of eccleſiaſtical Benefices the Pope, or (which is all one) the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath made by Bulls of prouiſion throughout this and other Kingdomes;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7910:110"/>
whereby many Chriſtians haue beene induced to account ſacriledge no ſinne. Secondly, what oaths, whether of allegiance from Subiects to their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes, or of ſolemne leagues betwixt Prince and Prince or free Soueraignties, or of ſolemne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts betwixt man and wife, haue beene diſpenſed withall, and vtterly nullified by the Pope; by which meanes a great part of the Chriſtian world haue beene ſeduced to eſteeme breach of lawfull vowes or periurie ioyned with diſloyaltie, to bee no ſinne. Thirdly, what mariages the Pope hath licenced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene parties forbidden to marry, not onely by the Law of God, but by the ciuill Law of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Romanes, and other Nations, by which means many great Families, and whole Chriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes haue beene induced to account ſuch inceſt or fornication, as was loathſome to the Gentiles, to be no ſinne. Fourthly, what maſſacres or cruell but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries of men neuer conuicted or condemned by courſe of Law, haue beene either licenced before hand, or commanded, or elſe allowed, approued, and commended after the fact done, by the Pope; whereby many Chriſtians haue beene ſeduced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count cruell murther no ſinne, but a meritorious act, yea an act of mercy and pitty towards Chriſts Church. If all ſuch particulars as belong to euery branch here ſpecified, and haue beene related by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall Hiſtorians, were duely collected and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the circumſtances; we might referre it to any Heathen Ciuilian, to any whom God hath not giuen ouer to <hi>a reprobate ſenſe</hi> to beleeue lyes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſuppoſed infallibility of the Romiſh

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7910:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doth proue their Prieſthood to be antichriſtian. And as many as receiued ordination in this forme, had the number, though not the character of the Beaſt. And although this clauſe did not nullifie their Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood which had beene thus ordained before the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the preſent Maſſe was fully diſcouered to be a part of Antichriſts Liturgie; yet doth it now make all communion with them either in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in the Romiſh Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt to bee a deſperate hereſie: and for this cauſe the controuerſie about the Maſſe muſt bee reſerued to the ſecond Booke of this TREATISE.</p>
