         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I have many things, and ſome extraordinary, which I cannot communicate, but
them that have need of my help, and will make uſe of me, I glory not in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or doing much, but in doing well that little which I undertake.</p>
               <p>1. I take forth hollow teeth or roots, though never ſo ſhort, with wonderfull
dexterity and eaſe. I make ſmooth and even teeth that are uneven. I put in
artificial teeth in the fore part of the mouth. Hollow teeth that you would not
have drawn, I can ſtop them. I can faſten looſe teeth.</p>
               <p>I have as good a ſecret as the world affords, infallibly to make teeth perfectly
white and clean, be they never ſo black or ruſty, in half an hour. I cannot
chuſe but convince their ignorance, that are againſt drawing of hollow teeth or
roots, by reaſon that all the art in the world cannot make a hollow tooth ſound
again, nor hinder it from infecting the next adjoyning teeth in time. Hollow
teeth breeds ſtinking breath, a Canker in the mouth, and other infirmities, and
their intolerable aking is able to bring one into a dangerous Feaver; all which
may be ſhunned, by taking forth ſuch teeth and ſtumps neatly: if it be true, that
it is good to take the broken from the whole; or that one ſcabbed ſheep may ſpoyl
a whole flock; or, it is good to repair imperfections of nature with Art; then all
that I have ſaid herein is true.</p>
               <p>I have a moſt ſingular Art in the Drawing forth Corns from the Feet or Toes
in a moſt excellent manner, with the whole ſubſtance in length of a Clove, or a
Barley-corn, without the appearance of blood, or putting the party to the leaſt
pain at all; applying to them a Plaiſter to hinder the growing of them again.</p>
               <p>Some will ſay, There is danger in cutting of Corns: The Profeſſor ſaith ſo too.
But you muſt conceive it is by thoſe of no Judgment; for they miſſe the Corn,
drow blood, cut the Nerves, and ſo it Gangrenes: which no Patient can ſay by
him, he having performed this Art to thouſands in moſt parts of this Land.</p>
               <p>He hath a Remedy for the Itch, no wayes offenſive to the Party, but ſweet
and pleaſant.</p>
               <p>The Profeſſor hath likewiſe ſeveral Remedies which are profitable for all ſorts
of people, and good for all theſe Infirmities here mentioned: which if you know the
goodneſſe of them, you would not be without them for ten times the price of them:
And with every one of them you have a printed Note to apply every Remedy in
its right uſe and manner. Theſe Remedies will held good 40 years. If you take
them together, you ſhall have them for a ſhilling: but any one ſingle will coſt ſix
pence. The Balſome you may have from a ſix-penny-Box, to a Five-ſhillings Pot,

tongues, I ſhall think my ſelf ſufficiently vindicated, that the diſcreeter ſort will
ſuſpend their Judgments at the firſt view, untill they hear what others will ſay that
