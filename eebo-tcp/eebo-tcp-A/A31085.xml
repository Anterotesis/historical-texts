            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Take the boldness to present your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with some of the First-fruits of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased Son's Studies in Divinity. And since it hath pleased God, to my unspeakable grief and loss, to deprive me of so great a blessing, and comfort of my old age; it is no small mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of my sorrow, that whilst he liv'd, he was not unprofitable to the world, and that now he is dead, he hath left those mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of his piety and learning behind him, which I am told are generally thought not unworthy to be imparted to the publick.</p>
            <p>If these <hi>Sermons</hi> be such, I have no cause
<pb facs="tcp:104623:4"/>
to doubt but they will easily obtain your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Patronage, who are so known a Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of all that is vertuous and worthy, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Religion and the Ministers of it. Of which I had particular experience upon the death of my good Son, when your Lordship was pleased, with so much humanity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension, to send to comfort me under that sad loss, and to express your own resentment of it.</p>
            <p>But what-ever these <hi>Sermons</hi> be, since I have no other way to acknowledge my great obligations to your Lordship upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I hope your Lordship will please favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to accept of this, how small soever, yet sincere testimony of my dutifull respects and gratitude. I am,</p>

            <head>THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Author</hi> of the following <hi>SERMONS</hi> was so publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, and so highly estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by all Learned and Good men, that nothing either needs or can be said more to his advantage. Not but that I think it very fit, that the Picture of this truly-great Man should be drawn at full length, for the knowledge and imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of posterity; and it will, I hope, be done hereafter by some more skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hand: However, I shall not within the narrow limits of a <hi>Preface,</hi> so much as attempt the Character of him; of whom, either not a little, or nothing at all ought to be said.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Sermons</hi> themselves do as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle need commendation, as the <hi>Authour;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:104623:5"/>
their own excellency and eloquence will praise them best. I shall therefore onely advertise the <hi>Reader</hi> of some few things concerning them.</p>
            <p>The Design of the <hi>Five</hi> first is, to recommend Religion to our esteem and practice, from the consideration of the manifold excellencies and advantages of it. The <hi>Four</hi> next do treat of the two great Duties of Religion, and parts of Divine Worship, <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;</hi> and contain likewise a very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull persuasive to the practice of them. The <hi>Three</hi> last were preach'd upon three solemn Occasions: The <hi>First</hi> of them upon the 29. of <hi>May,</hi> 1676. the Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary of His MAJESTIE's happy <hi>Restoration:</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> upon the 5. of <hi>November,</hi> 1675. in commemoration of our great Deliverance from the <hi>Powder-Treason:</hi> both in the year of his <hi>Vice-Chancellourship:</hi> The <hi>Last</hi> at the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the Bishop of <hi>Man,</hi> (the now Lord Bishop of <hi>S. Asaph,)</hi> his Uncle; in which he pleads for the due Respect and Revenue of the Clergy with so much modesty, and yet with so great force of reason and eloquence, that the whole Profession may justly think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for ever indebted to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:104623:5"/>
Some of these <hi>Sermons</hi> were the very first that he made; by which we may judge with what preparation and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he entred upon this Sacred employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The <hi>first</hi> of them was preach'd at <hi>S. Mary's</hi> in <hi>Cambridge, June</hi> 30. 1661. and was, I think, the first that he ever preach'd. Those <hi>two</hi> excellent <hi>Sermons</hi> of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> were, as I am inform'd, the next. The <hi>fourth</hi> in order, was the first that he preach'd before the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Majesty.</hi> In the placing of them as they now stand, I had very little regard to the order of Time, but rather to some small reason taken from the Subject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them, not worth the mentioning; any reason almost being good enough in a matter so indifferent, and where none is necessary.</p>
            <p>Besides these, the <hi>Authour</hi> hath left many other excellent <hi>Sermons,</hi> upon the most important and usefull Subjects in <hi>Divinity;</hi> particularly, upon ail the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Creed:</hi> and several other very learned Discourses and Treatises, <hi>Theological</hi> and <hi>Mathematical:</hi> which may, God willing, in convenient time be communicated to the publick, to the great advantage and furtherance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Learning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:104623:6"/>
In the mean time, I heartily recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend these <hi>Sermons</hi> to thy serious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usal; and shall onely say this of them, That as they want no other kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, so particularly they are anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted throughout with so genuine a spirit of true Piety and Goodness, that he must either be a perfectly-good, or prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously-bad man, that can reade them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without being the better for them.</p>

               <head>The First Sermon.</head>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>PROV. 3. 17.</bibl>
                  <q>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THE meaning of these words seems plain and obvious, and to need little explication. <hi>Her ways,</hi> that is, the ways of Wisedom. What this Wisedom is, I shall not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake accurately to describe. Briefly, I understand by it, An habitual skill or faculty of judging aright about matters of practice, and chusing according to that right judgment, and conforming the actions to such good choice. <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>paths</hi> in Scripture-dialect are the courses and manners of action. For <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> there is commonly called <hi>walking;</hi> and the methods of doing are the <hi>ways</hi> in which we walk. By <hi>pleasantness</hi> may be meant the joy and delight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying, and by <hi>peace</hi> the content
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104623:9"/>
and satisfaction ensuing such a course of actions. So that, in short, the sense of these words seems simply to be this, That a course of life directed by wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and good judgment is delightfull in the practice, and brings content after it. The truth of which Proposition it shall be my endeavour at this time to confirm by divers Reasons, and illustrate by several instances.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Then, Wisedom of it self is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable and satisfactory, as it implies a revelation of Truth, and a detection of Errour to us. 'Tis like Light, pleasant to behold, casting? sprightly lustre, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Veritatis luce menti h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>minis nihil dulcius.</hi> Cic. <hi>Acad.</hi> 2.</note> diffusing a benign influence all about; presenting a goodly prospect of things to the eyes of our mind; displaying ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in their due shapes, postures, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes, and colours; quickning our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits with a comfortable warmth, and disposing our minds to a chearfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; dispelling the darkness of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, scattering the mists of doubt, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving away the spectres of delusive fancy; mitigating the cold of sullen melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; discovering obstacles, securing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, and making the passages of life clear, open, and pleasant. We are all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104623:9"/>
endowed with a strong appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to know, to see, to pursue Truth; and with a bashfull abhorrency from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceived, and entangled in mistake. And as success in enquiry after Truth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords matter of joy and triumph; so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conscious of Errour, and miscarriage therein, is attended with shame and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. These desires Wisedom in the most perfect manner satisfies, not by entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us with dry, empty, fruitless theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, upon mean and vulgar subjects; but by enriching our minds with excellent and usefull knowledge, directed to the noblest objects, and serviceable to the highest ends. Nor in its own nature onely, but,</p>
               <p n="2">II. Much more in its worthy conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences is Wisedom exceedingly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and peaceable: in general, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing us to acquire and to enjoy all the good, delight and happiness we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of; and by freeing us from all the inconveniences, mischiefs and infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties our condition is subject to. For what-ever good from clear understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, deliberate advice, sagacious fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, stable resolution, dexterous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress, right intention and orderly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104623:10"/>
doth naturally result, Wisedom conferrs: what-ever evil blind igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, false presumption, unwary cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, precipitate rashness, unsteady purpose, ill contrivance, backwardness, inhability, unwieldiness and confusion of thought beget, Wisedom prevents. From thousand snares and treacherous allurements, from innumerable rocks and dangerous surprises, from exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many needless incumbrances and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious toils of fruitless endeavour, she redeems and secures us. More particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,</p>
               <p n="3">III. Wisedom assures us we take the best course, and proceed as we ought. For by the same means we judge aright, and reflecting upon that judgment are assured we doe so: as the same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which we demonstrate a the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem convince us we have demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and the same light by which we see an object makes us know we see it. And this assurance in the progress of the action exceedingly pleases, and in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of it infinitely contents us. He that judges amiss, not perceiving clearly the rectitude of his process, proceeds usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a dubious solicitude, and at
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104623:10"/>
length, discovering his errour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns his own choice, and receives no other satisfaction but of repentance. Like a Traveller, who being uncertain whether he goes in the right way, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in continual perplexity, till he be informed; and then too late, understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his mistake, with regret seeks to recover himself into it. But he that knows his way, and is satisfied that it is the true one, makes on merrily and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly, not doubting he shall in good time arrive to his designed journey's end. Two troublesome mischiefs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Wisedom frees us from, the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of anxious doubt in our actions, and the consequence of bitter repentance. For no man can doubt of what he is sure of, nor repent of what he knows good.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Wisedom begets in us a hope of success in our actions, and is usually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended therewith. Now what is more delicious then hope? what more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory then success? That is like the pursuit of a flying enemy, this like ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the spoil; that like viewing the ripe corn, this like the joy of harvest it self. And he that aims at a good end, and knows he uses proper means to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104623:11"/>
it, why should he despair of success, since effects naturally follow their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and the Divine providence is wont to afford its concourse to such procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings? Beside that such well-grounded hope confirms resolution, and quickens activity, which mainly conduce to the prosperous issue of designs. Farther,</p>
               <p n="5">V. Wisedom prevents discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the possibility of ill success, yea and makes disappointment it self tolerable. For if either the foresight of a possible miscarriage should discourage us from adventuring on action, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culpable frustration were intolerable, we should with no heart apply our selves to any thing; there being no designs in this world, though founded upon the most sound advice, and prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the most diligent endeavour, which may not be defeated, as depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon divers causes above our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and circumstances beyond our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect. The inconstant opinions, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain resolutions, mutable affections, and fallacious pretences of men, upon which the accomplishment of most projects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, may easily deceive and disappoint us. The imperceptible course of nature
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104623:11"/>
exerting it self in sudden tempests, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, and unlucky casualties, may sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise us, and give an end to our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and lives together. However, the irresistible power of the Divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, guided by the unsearchable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of his will, we can never be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it will not interpose, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the effects of our endeavours. Yet notwithstanding, when we act prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we have no reason to be dishear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened; because, having good intentions, and using fit means, and having done our best, as no deserved blame, so no considerable dammage can arrive to us: and though we find Almighty God hath crossed us, yet we are sure he is not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with us. Which consideration, wherewith Wisedom furnishes us, will make the worst success not onely tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but comfortable to us. For hence we have reason to hope, that the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Goodness reserves a better reward for us, and will sometime recompense not onely the good purposes we unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily pursued, but also the unexpected disappointment we patiently endured; and that however we shall be no losers in the end. Which discourse is mainly fortified by considering how the best
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104623:12"/>
and wisest attempts have oft miscarried. We see <hi>Moses,</hi> authorized by God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, directed by his counsel, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by his hand, intended to bring the <hi>Israelites</hi> into the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> yet by the unreasonable incredulity and stubborn perverseness of that people he had his purpose frustrated. The holy Prophets afterward earnestly endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to contain the same people within compass of obedience to the Divine commands, and to reduce them from their idolatrous and wicked courses; yet without correspondent effect. Our Saviour, by the example of his holy life, continual instruction, and vehement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, assayed to procure a belief of and submission to his most excellent Doctrine; yet how few <hi>believed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> and complied with his Discipline? Yea, Almighty God himself often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, how in a manner his designs were defeated, his desires thwarted, his offers refused, his counsels rejected, his expectations deceived, <hi>Wherefore,</hi> (saith he concerning his Vineyard) <hi>when I</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 5. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>looked it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</hi> And again, <hi>I have</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 65. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>spred out my hands all the day to a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people.</hi> And again, <hi>I have even sent</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 7. 25.</note>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:104623:12"/>
                  <hi>unto you all my prophets daily, rising up early, and sending them; yet they hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened not unto me.</hi> Wherefore there is no good cause we should be disheartned, or vexed, when success is wanting to well-advised purposes. 'Tis foolish and ill-grounded intentions, and practices unwarrantable by good reason, that make the undertakers solicitous of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and being defeated leave them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolate. Yea farther,</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Wisedom makes all the troubles, griefs and pains incident to life, whether casual adversities, or natural afflictions, easie and supportable; by rightly valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the importance, and moderating the influence of them. It suffers not busie fancy to alter the nature, amplifie the degree, or extend the duration of them, by representing them more sad, heavy and remediless then they truly are. It allows them no force beyond what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and necessarily they have, nor contributes nourishment to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease. It keeps them at a due distance, not permitting them to encroach upon the Soul, or to propagate their influence beyond their proper sphere. It will not let external mischances, as poverty and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104623:13"/>
disgrace, to produce an inward sense which is beyond their natural efficacy; nor corporeal affections of sickness and pain to disturb the mind, with which they have nothing to doe. The region of these malignant distempers being at most but the habit of the body, Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by effectual antidotes repells them from the heart, and inward parts of the Soul. If any thing, sin, and our unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy miscarriages toward God, should vex and discompose us; yet this trouble Wisedom, by representing the Divine Goodness, and his tender mercies in our ever-Blessed Redeemer, doth perfectly allay. And as for all other adversities, it abates their noxious power, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us they are either meerly imaginary, or very short and temporary; that they admit of remedy, or at most do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude comfort, not wholly hindring the operations of the mind, nor extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing its joys; that they may have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable use, and pleasant end; and, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, neither imply bad Conscience, nor induce obligation to punishment. For,</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Wisedom hath always a good Conscience attending it, that purest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and richest cordial of the Soul;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104623:13"/>
that brazen wall, and impregnable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress against both external assaults, and internal commotions; that <hi>continual feast,</hi> whereon the mind, destitute of all other repast, with a never-languishing appetite may entertain it self; that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witness, and impartial judge, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever accuses, always acquitting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Soul; that certain friend, in no streight failing, in no adversity deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; that sure refuge in all storms of fortune, and persecutions of disgrace. Which (as <hi>Solomon</hi> here notes) renders a man's <hi>sleep sweet,</hi> and undisturbed with fearfull phantasms, his heart light, and his steps secure; and, if any thing, can make the Stoical paradox good, and cause the Wise man to smile in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of torment; arming his mind with an invincible courage, and infusing a due confidence into it, whereby he bears up chearfully against malicious reproach, undauntedly sustains adversity, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs over bad fortune. And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable treasure the Wise man is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly capable of possessing, who certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knows, and heartily approves the grounds upon which he proceeds; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the fool, building his choice upon blind chance, or violent passion, or gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104623:14"/>
fancy, or uncertain example, not upon the steddy warrant of good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, cannot avoid being perplexed with suspicion of mistake, and so necessarily is deprived of the comfort of a good Conscience.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Wisedom confers a facility, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert readiness, and dexterity in action; which is a very pleasant and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous quality, and exceedingly sweetens activity. To doe things with difficulty, struggling, and immoderate contention, disheartens a man, quells his courage, blunts the edge of his resolution, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him sluggish and averse from busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, though apprehended never so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and of great moment. These obstructions Wisedom removes, facilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting operations by directing the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ends possible and attainable, by suggesting fit means and instruments to work by, by contriving right methods and courses of process; the mind by it being stored with variety of good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, sure rules, and happy expedients, reposed in the memory, and ready upon all occasions to be produced, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in practice.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:104623:14"/>
IX. Wisedom begets a sound, health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and harmonious complexion of the Soul, disposing us with judgment to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish, and with pleasure to relish sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury and wholsome things, but to nauseate and reject such as are ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and noxious to us; thereby capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying us to enjoy pleasantly and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently all those good things the Divine Goodness hath provided for, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to us: whence to the Soul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all that comfort, joy and vigour, which results to the Body from a good constitution, and perfect health.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Wisedom acquaints us with our selves, our own temper and constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, our propensions and passions, our habitudes and capacities; a thing not onely of mighty advantage, but of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite pleasure and content to us. No man in the world less knows a fool then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; nay, he is more then ignorant, for he constantly errs in the point, taking himself for, and demeaning himself as toward another, a better, a wiser and abler man then he is. He hath wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conceits of his own qualities and faculties; he affects commendations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent to him; he soars at employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104623:15"/>
surpassing his ability to manage. No Comedy can represent a mistake more odde, and ridiculous, then his: for he wanders, and stares, and hunts after, but never can find nor discern himself; but always encounters with a false shadow in stead thereof, which he passionately huggs and admires. But a Wise man, by constant observation, and impartial reflexion upon himself, grows very familiar with himself: he perceives his own inclinations, which if bad, he strives to alter and correct; if good, he cherishes and corroborates them: he apprehends the matters he is fitting for, and capable to manage, neither too mean and unworthy of him, nor too high and difficult for him; and those applying his care to, he transacts easily, chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and successfully. So being neither puft up with vain and over-weening o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, nor dejected with heartless dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of himself; neither admiring, nor despising; neither irksomely hating, nor fondly loving himself; he continues in good humour, maintains a sure friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and fair correspondence with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and rejoyces in the retirement and private conversation with his own thoughts: whence flows a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104623:15"/>
and satisfaction unexpressible.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Wisedom procures and preserves a constant favour and fair respect of men, purchases a good name, and upholds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in the world: which things are naturally desirable, commodious for life, encouragements to good, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive of many inconveniences. The composed frame of mind, uniform and comely demeanour, compliant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offensive conversation, fair and punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual dealing, considerate motions and dextrous addresses of Wise men, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally beget esteem and affection in those that observe them. Neither then these things is there any thing more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to humane regard. As symmetry and harmony to the animal senses, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable is an even temper of Soul and orderly tenour of actions to rational ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions. Folly is freakish and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous, impertinent and obstreperous, inconstant and inconsistent, peevish and exceptious; and consequently fastidious to society, and productive of aversation and disrespect. But the Wise man is sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his ways, consonant to himself, suting his actions to his words, and those to his principles, and all to the rule of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104623:16"/>
right reason; so that you may know where to find him, and how to deal with him, and may easily please him, which makes his acquaintance accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and his person valuable: beside that real worth of it self commands respect, and extorts veneration from men, and usually prosperity waits upon his well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advised attempts, which exceedingly adorn, and advance the credit of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker: however, if he fail sometime, his usual deportment salves his repute, and easily makes it credible it was no fault of his, but of his fortune. If a fool prosper, the honour is attributed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious chance; if he miscarry, to his own ill management: but the entire glory of happy undertakings crowns the head of Wisedom; while the disgrace of unlucky events falls otherwhere. His light, like that of the Sun, cannot totally be eclipsed; it may be dimmed, but never extinguished, and always maintains a day, though over-clouded with misfortune. Who less esteems the famous <hi>African</hi> Captain for being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown in that last fatal battel, wherein he is said to have shewn the best skill, and yet endured the worst of success? Who contemns <hi>Cato,</hi> and other the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104623:16"/>
grave Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> for embracing the just, but improsperous Cause of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth? A Wise man's circumstances may vary and fluctuate like the flouds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a rock; but he persists immovably the same, and his reputation unshaken: for he can always render a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of his actions, and by reasonable apology elude the assaults of reproach.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Wisedom instructs us to examin, compare, and rightly to value the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that court our affections, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge our care; and thereby regulates our passions, and moderates our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, which begets a pleasant serenity and peaceable tranquillity of mind. For when, being deluded with false shews, &amp; relying upon ill-grounded presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we highly esteem, passionately affect, and eagerly pursue things of little worth in themselves, or concernment to us, as we unhandsomely prostitute our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and prodigally miss-spend our time, and vainly lose our labour; so the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent not answering our expectation, our minds thereby are confounded, disturb'd, and distempered. But when, guided by right reason, we conceive great esteem of, and zealously are enamoured with,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104623:17"/>
and vigorously strive to attain things of excellent worth, and weighty conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; the conscience of having well placed our affections, and well employed our pains, and the experience of fruits corresponding to our hopes, ravish our mind with unexpressible content. And so it is; Present appearance and vulgar conceit ordinarily impose upon our fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, disguising things with a deceitfull varnish, and representing those that are vainest with the greatest advantage; whilst the noblest objects, being of a more subtile and spiritual nature, like fairest Jewels enclosed in a homely box, avoid the notice of gross sense, and pass undiscerned by us. But the light of Wisedom, as it unmasks specious impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, and bereavesit of its false colours; so it penetrates into the retirements of true Excellency, and reveals its genuine lustre. For example, Corporeal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which so powerfully allures and enchants us, Wisedom declares that it is but a present, momentany and transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent satisfaction of brutish sense, dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the light, sullying the beauty, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the vigour, and restraining the activity of the mind; diverting it from better operations, and indisposing it to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104623:17"/>
enjoy purer delights; leaving no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable relish or gladsome memory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it, but often followed with bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, regret and disgrace. That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the World so greedily gapes after is but a possession of trifles, not valuable in themselves, nor rendering the Masters of them so; accidentally obtained, and promiscuously enjoyed by all sorts, but commonly by the worst of men; diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly acquired, and easily lost; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to be used but for a very short time, and then to be resigned into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain hands. That the Honour men so dote upon is, ordinarily, but the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a few petty circumstances, a peculiar name or title, a determinate place, a distinguishing ensign; things of onely imaginary excellence, derived from chance, and conferring no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, except from some little influence they have upon the arbitrary opinion and fickle humour of the people; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence in which is vain, and reliance upon it dangerous. That Power and dominion, which men so impatiently struggle for, are but necessary evils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to restrain the bad tempers of men; most evil to them that enjoy them; requiring tedious attendance, distrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104623:18"/>
care, and vexatious toil; atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with frequent disappointment, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious censure, and dangerous envy; having such reall burthens, and slavish encumbrances, sweetned onely by su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial pomps, strained obsequious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, some petty privileges, and exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions scarce worth the mentioning. That Wit and parts, of which men make such ostentation, are but natural endowments, commendable onely in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to use, apt to engender pride and vanity, and hugely dangerous if abused or misemployed. What should I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Beauty, that fading toy; or bodily Strength and activity, qualities so pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably inconsiderable? Upon these and such like flattering objects, so adored by vulgar opinion, Wisedom exercising se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and impartial judgment, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in them no intrinsick excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, no solid content springing from them, no perfection thence accruing to the mind, no high reward allotted to them, no security to the future condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or other durable advantages pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from them; it concludes they deserve not any high opinion of the mind, nor any vehement passion of the Soul, nor any laborious care to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104623:18"/>
on them, and moderates our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections toward them: it frees us from anxious desire of them; from being transported with excessive joy in the acquisition of them; from being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with disconsolate sorrow at the missing of them, or parting with them; from repining and envying at those who have better success then our selves in the procuring them; from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate toil in getting, and care in preserving them: and so delivering us from all these unquiet anxieties of thought, tumultuous perturbations of passion, and tedious vexations of body, it maintains our minds in a chearfull calm, quiet indifferency, and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble liberty. On the other side, things of real worth and high concernment, that produce great satisfaction to the mind, and are mainly conducible to our happiness, such as are a right understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and strong sense of our obligations to Almighty God, and relations to men, a sound temper and complexion of mind, a vertuous disposition, a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to discharge the duties of our places, a due qualification to enjoy the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the other World; these and such like things, by discovering their nature,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104623:19"/>
and the effects resulting from them, it engages us highly to esteem, ardently to affect, and industriously to pursue; so preventing the inconveniences that follow the want of them, and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the benefits arising from the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. Wisedom distinguishes the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, limits the measures, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the modes, appoints the fit seasons of action; so preserving <hi>decorum</hi> and order, the parent of peace, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting confusion, the mother of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, strife and disquiet. 'Tis in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of humane life as in a building: a due proportion of bigness, a fit situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of place, a correspondency of shape, and sutableness of colour, is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved between the parts thereof: a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in any of which requisites, though the materials hap to be choice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, makes the whole fabrick defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ugly to judicious apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The best actions, if they swell, and exceed their due measure, if they be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully misplaced, if in uncouth manner performed, they lose their quality, and turn both to the disgrace and disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of life. 'Tis commendable to pray;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104623:19"/>
but they that would always be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that duty, by their absurd devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on procured to themselves the title of Hereticks: and they that will stand pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in places of publick concourse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served our Saviour's reprehensions: and those men who, against the custom and ordinary use, would needs pray with their faces covered, you know S. <hi>Paul</hi> insinuates of them, that they were fond and contentious persons. Friendly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition is very laudable, and of rare use; but being upon all occasions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately used, or in publick society so as to encroach upon modesty, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammage reputation; or when the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son admonished is otherwise employed, and attent upon his business; or being delivered in an imperiously-insulting way, or in harsh and opprobrious lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; it becomes unsavoury and odious, and both in shew and effect resembles a froward malicious exceptiousness. 'Twere infinite to compute in how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny instances want of due order, measure and manner, do spoil and incommodate action. 'Tis Wisedom that applies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to these mischiefs. Things must be compared to, and arbitrated by, her standard, or else they will contain some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104623:20"/>
of monstrous enormity; either strutting in unwieldy bulk, or sinking in defective scantness. If she do not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion and model circumstances, they will sit ugly on the things that wear them; if she do not temper the colours, and describe the lineaments, the draught of practice will be but rude and imperfect, and little resemble the true patterns of duty: but if she interpose, and perform her part, all things will appear confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, neat and delicate.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Wisedom discovers our relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, duties and concernments, in respect of men, with the natural grounds of them; thereby both qualifying and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us to the discharge of them: whence exceeding convenience, pleasure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ensues. By it we understand we are parts and members of the great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Universe; and are therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the good management of it, and are thereby obliged to procure its order and peace, and by no irregular undertaking to disturb or discompose it; which makes us honest and peaceable men: that we proceed from the same primitive stock, are children of the same father, and partake of the same bloud
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104623:20"/>
with all men; are endowed with like faculties of mind, passions of Soul, shape of body, and sense of things: that we have equally implanted in our original constitution inclinations to love, pity, gratitude, sociableness, quiet, joy, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: that we have an indispensable need and impatient desire of company, of assistence, comfort, and relief: that therefore it is according to the design of nature, and agreeable to reason, that to those, to whom our natural condition by so many bands of cognation, simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and mutual necessitude, hath knit and conjoyned us, we should bear a kind respect and tender affection; should chearfully concurre in undergoing the common burthens; should heartily wish and industriously promote their good, assist them in accomplishing their reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable desires, thankfully requite the courtesies received from them, congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate and rejoyce with them in their prosperity, comfort them in their distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and, as we are able, relieve them; however, tenderly compassionate their disappointments, miseries and sorrows. This renders us kind and courteous neighbours; sweet and gratefull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. It represents unto us the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104623:21"/>
effects and insupportable mischiefs arising from breach of faith, contrave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the obligations of solemn pacts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringing publick laws, deviating from the received rules of equity, violating promises, and interrupting good corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence among men: by which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations it engages us to be good ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, obedient subjects, just dealers, and faithfull friends. It minds us of the blindness, impotence and levity, the proneness to mistake, and misbehaviour that humane nature necessarily is subject to; deserving rather our commiserati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then anger or hatred, which prompts us to bear the infirmities of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to be gentle in censure, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible of petty affronts, to pardon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, to be patient, exorable, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable to those that give us greatest cause of offence. It teaches us, the good may, but the evil of our neighbour can in no wise advantage us; that from the suffering of any man, simply considered, no benefit can accrue, nor natural satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction arise to us; and that therefore 'tis a vain, base, brutish and unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, for any cause whatsoever, to desire or delight in the grief, pain or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of our neighbour, to hate or envy
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104623:21"/>
him, or insult over him, or devise mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to him, or prosecute revenge upon him; which makes us civil, noble and placable enemies, or rather no enemies at all. So that Wisedom is in effect the genuine parent of all moral and politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal vertue, justice and honesty; as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> says in her person, <hi>I lead in the way of righteousness,</hi> and <hi>in the midst of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 8. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>the paths of judgment.</hi> And how sweet these are in the practice, how comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the consequences, the testimony of continual experience and the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous consent of all wise men sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare. But farther,</p>
               <p n="15">XV. The principal advantage of Wisedom is, its acquainting us with the Nature and reason of true Religion, and affording convictive arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade to the Practice of it; which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the purest delight, and attended with the most solid content imaginable. I say, the Nature of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein it consists, and what it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; the mistake of which produceth daily so many mischiefs and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in the world, and exposes so good a name to so much reproach. It sheweth it consisteth not in fair professions and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104623:22"/>
glorious pretences, but in real practice; not in a pertinacious adherence to any Sect or party, but in a sincere love of goodness, and dislike of naughtiness, where-ever discovering it self; not in vain ostentations and flourishes of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward performance, but in an inward good complexion of mind, exerting it self in works of true Devotion and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; not in a nice orthodoxie, or poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick subjection of our judgments to the peremptory dictates of men, but in a sincere love of Truth, in a hearty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of and compliance with the Doctrines fundamentally good, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be believed; not in harsh cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring and virulently inveighing against others, but in carefull amending our own ways; not in a peevish crosness and obstinate repugnancy to received laws and customs, but in a quiet and peaceable submission to the express Laws of God, and lawfull commands of man; not in a furious zeal for or against trivial circumstances, but in a conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable practising the substantial parts of Religion; not in a frequent talking or contentious disputing about it, but in a ready observance of the unquestionable rules and prescripts of it. In a word,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104623:22"/>
that Religion consists in nothing else but doing what becomes our relation to God, in a conformity or similitude to his Nature, and in a willing obedience to his holy Will: to which by potent incentives it allures and persuades us; by representing to us his transcendently<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious Attributes, conspicuously dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in the frame, order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World; that wonderfull Power, which erected this great and goodly fabrick; that incomprehensible Wisedom, which preserves it in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant harmony; that immense Goodness, which hath so carefully provided for the various necessities, delights and comforts of its innumerable inhabitants. I say, by representing those infinitely-glorious Perfections, it engages us with highest respect to esteem, reverence and honour him. Also, by minding us of our mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold obligations to him, our receiving being, life, reason, sense, all the faculties, powers, excellencies, privileges and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of our natures from him; of his tender Care and loving Providence continually supporting and protecting us; of his liberal Beneficence, patient Indulgence, and earnest desire of our good and happiness by manifold expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104623:23"/>
evidently manifested toward us; it inflames us with ardent love, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges us to officious gratitude toward him. Also, by declaring the necessary and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable contrariety of his Nature to all impurity and perverseness, his peerless Majesty, his irresistible Power, and his all-seeing Knowledge, it begets an awfull dread and a devout fear of him. By discovering him from his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Benignity willing, and from his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Power onely able to supply our needs, relieve us in distresses, protect us from dangers, and confer any valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benefit upon us, it engenders Faith, and encourages us to rely upon him. By revealing to us his supereminent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, uncontrollable Dominion, and unquestionable Authority over us; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the admirable excellency, wisedom and equity of his Laws, so just and reasonable in themselves, so sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to our nature, so conducible to our good, so easie and practicable, so sweet and comfortable; it powerfully inclines, and by a gentle force as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains us to obedience. By such efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inducements Wisedom urges us to all duties of Religion, and withall sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directs us (as I before said) wherein it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104623:23"/>
consists; teaching us to have right and worthy apprehensions of the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to which our Devotion (if true and good) must be suited and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: and so it frees us, as from irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and profane neglect of God, so from fond superstitions, the sources of so much evil to mankind. For he that wisely hath considered the Wisedom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Power of God, cannot imagine God can with a regardless eye over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look his presumptuous contempts of his Laws, or endure him to proceed in an outrageous defiance of Heaven, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue hurting himself, or injuring his neighbour; nor can admit unreasonable terrours, or entertain suspicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of God, as of an imperious Master, or implacable Tyrant over him, exacting impossible performances from, or deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the fatal miseries of his Creatures; nor can suppose him pleased with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical shews, and greatly taken with superficial courtships of ceremonious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress; or that he can in any wise favour our fiery zeals, fierce passions, or unjust partialities about matter of opinion and ceremony; or can doe otherwise then detest all factious, harsh, uncharitable and revengefull proceedings, of what
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104623:24"/>
nature, or upon what ground soever; or that he can be so inconsistent with himself, as to approve any thing but what is like himself, that is, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Sincerity, and Beneficence.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Wisedom attracts the Favour of God, purchaseth a glorious Reward, and secureth perpetual Felicity to us. <hi>For</hi>

And the paths she leads in are such as direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tend to the promised Inheritance of joy and bliss.</p>
               <p>

Thus have I simply and plainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented you with part of what my medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation suggested upon this Subject: It remains that we endeavour to obtain this excellent endowment of Soul, by the faithfull exercise of our Reason, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full observation of things, diligent study of the Divine Law, watchfull reflexion upon our selves, vertuous and religious practice; but especially, by imploring the Divine influence, the original spring of light, and fountain of all true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, following S. <hi>James</hi> his advice, <hi>If any man lack wisedom, let him ask it of God, who giveth freely.</hi> Therefore, O everlasting Wisedom, the Maker, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and Governour of all things, let some comfortable Beams from thy great Body of heavenly Light descend upon us, to illuminate our dark minds, and quicken our dead hearts; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame us with ardent love unto thee, and to direct our steps in obedience to thy Laws, through the gloomy shades of this world, into that region of eternal light and bliss, where thou reignest in perfect Glory and Majesty, one God ever-Blessed, world without end.</p>

The reason indeed is obvious and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough, the very name of Profit implieth it, signifying that which is use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104623:26"/>
or conducible to purposes really or seemingly good. The gain of mony, or of somewhat equivalent thereto, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore specially termed Profit, because it readily supplieth necessity, furnisheth convenience, feedeth pleasure, satisfieth fancy and curiosity, promoteth ease and liberty, supporteth honour and dignity, procureth power, dependencies, and friendships, rendereth a man some-body, considerable in the world; in fine, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth to doe good, or to perform works of beneficence and charity. Profit is therefore so much affected and pursued, because it is, or doth seem, apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure or promote some good desirable to us.</p>
               <p>If therefore a Project should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to us very fecible and probable to succeed, in pursuance whereof assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly we might obtain great Profit; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, in consistence with our selves, and conformably to our usual manner of acting, we should be very ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and execute it. Such a Project it is which in my Text, by a very trusty Voucher, and skilfull Judge of such things, and one who had himself fully experimented it, is proposed; which in it self is very practicable, so that any of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104623:27"/>
us may, if we have a mind to it, and will be at the pains, throughly compass and carry it on; which will exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn to account, and bring in Gains unto us unspeakably vast; in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereto all other designs, which men with so much care and toil do pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, are very unprofitable or detrimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, yielding but shadows of profit, or bringing real dammage to us.</p>
               <p>It is briefly this, to be religious or pious; that is, in our minds stedfastly to believe on God, (such as nature in some measure, and revelation more clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth him,) in our hearts earnestly to love and reverence him, through all our practice sincerely and diligently to observe his Laws. This is it which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth to be <hi>profitable for all things,</hi> and which it is my intent, by God's help, to recommend unto you as such; demonstrating it really to be so, by representing some of those number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less benefits and advantages which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue from it, extending to all conditions and capacities of men, to all states, all seasons, and in effect to all affairs of life.</p>
               <p>It hath been ever a main obstruction to the practice of Piety, that it hath

been taken for no friend, or rather for an enemy, to Profit; as both unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and prejudicial to its followers: and many semblances there are countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that opinion. For Religion see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to smother or to slacken the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry and alacrity of men in following Profit, many ways: by charging them to be content with a little, and carefull for nothing; by diverting their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and cares from worldly affairs to matters of another nature, place, and time, prescribing in the first place to seek things spiritual, heavenly, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; by disparaging all secular wealth, as a thing, in comparison to Vertue and spiritual goods, very mean and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable; by checking greedy desires and aspiring thoughts after it; by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring the most ready ways of getting it, (violence, exaction, fraud, and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,) yea, streightning the best ways, eager care and diligence; by commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding strict Justice in all cases, and always taking part with Conscience when it clasheth with Interest; by paring away the largest uses of Wealth, in the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of its free enjoyment to pride or pleasure; by injoyning liberal commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication thereof in ways of charity and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104623:28"/>
mercy; by engaging men to expose their goods sometimes to imminent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, sometimes to certain loss; obliging them to forsake all things, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Poverty for its sake.</p>
               <p>It favoureth this conceit, to observe, that often bad men by impious courses do appear to thrive and prosper; while good men seem for their goodness to suffer, or to be no-wise visibly better for it, enduring much hardship and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress.</p>
               <p>It furthereth the prejudice, that some persons, void of true Piety, or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good, (some <hi>Dabblers</hi> in Religion,) do not from their lame, slight and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial performances feel satisfactory returns, such as they did presume to find; and thence, to the defamation of Piety, are apt to say, with those men in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>It is vain to serve God, and what</hi>

               <p>To these considerations, disadvantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in this respect to Piety, may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the constant and certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits emergent from it (although incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more substantial, and to the mind more sensible then any other) are not yet so gross and palpable, that men, who from being immersed in earth and flesh are blind in errour, dull of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, vain and inconsiderate in their judgments, tainted and vitiated in their palates, can discern their worth, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish their sweetness.

I shall (as I said) propose some of those innumerable advantages, by conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which the immense profitableness of Piety will appear.

               <p>In consequence to those Practices springing from it, Piety removeth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, violence, faction, disorders and murmurings, out of the State; schisms and scandals out of the Church; pride and haughtiness, sloth and luxury, detraction and sycophantry, out of the

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104623:31"/>
accommodations of their state.

                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:104623:32"/>
II. Piety doth fit a man for all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, qualifying him to pass through them all with the best advantage, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, chearfully and safely, so as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre no considerable harm or detriment by them.</p>
               <p>Is a man prosperous, high, or weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in condition? Piety guardeth him from all the mischiefs incident to that state, and disposeth him to enjoy the best advantages thereof. It keepeth him from being swelled and puffed up with vain conceit, from being transported with fond complacence or confidence therein; minding him, that it is purely the gift of God, that it absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on his disposall, so that it may soon be taken from him, and that he cannot otherwise then by humility, by gratitude, by the good use of it, be secure to retain it; minding him also, that he shall assuredly be forced to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a strict account concerning the good management thereof. It preserveth him from being perverted or corrupted with the temptations to which that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is most liable; from luxury, from sloth, from stupidity, from forgetfulness of God, and of himself; maintaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the flouds of plenty a sober and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104623:32"/>
steddy mind. It fenceth him from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence, and fastuous contempt of others; rendreth him civil, condescensive, kind and helpfull to those who are in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner state. It instructeth and inciteth him to apply his wealth and power to the best uses, to the Service of God, to the benefit of his Neighbour, for his own best reputation, and most solid comfort. It is the right balast of prosperity, the onely antidote for all the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of wealth; that which secureth, sweetneth, and sanctifieth all other goods: without it all apparent goods are very noxious, or extremely dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; riches, power, honour, ease, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, are so many poisons, or so many snares, without it. Again, is a man poor and low in the world? Piety doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and sweeten even that state: it keepeth his spirits up above dejection, desperation, and disconsolateness; it freeth him from all grievous solicitude and anxiety; shewing him, that although he seemeth to have little, yet he may be assured to want nothing, he having a certain succour and never-failing supply from God's good Providence; that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the present streightness of his condition, or scantness of outward
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:104623:33"/>
things, he hath a title to Goods infinitely more precious and more considerable. A pious man cannot but apprehend himself like the Child of a most wealthy, kind and carefull Father, who although he hath yet nothing in his own possession, or passing under his name, yet is assured that he can never come into any want of what is needfull to him: the Lord of all things (who hath all things in Heaven and Earth at his disposal, who is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tender of his Childrens good, who doth incessantly watch over them) being his gracious Father, how can he fear to be left destitute, or not to be competent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for, as is truly best for him?</p>
               <p>This is the difference between a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and an impious man. Is the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man in need? he hath then an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible refuge to fly to, an invisible store to furnish him; he hath somewhat beyond all present things to hope in, to comfort himself with: whereas the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious person hath nothing beside present appearances to support or solace himself by; the which failing, down he sinketh into dejection and despair. Is the good man in affliction? he knoweth that it cometh not on him without God's wise appointment, nor without good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104623:33"/>
toward him, for probation, exercise and improvement of his Vertues, or for wholsome correction of his bad disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that it is onely Physick and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline to him, which shall have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable issue; that it shall last no longer then it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient <note place="margin">

Never, indeed, hath any man enjoyed more real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or hath been more truly satisfied, then good men have been in a seeming depth of adversity. What men ever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth have been more sorely afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, have underwent greater losses, disgraces, labours, <note place="margin">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104623:34"/>
condition in effect can be evil or sad to a pious man: his very sorrows are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, his infirmities are wholsome, his wants enrich him, his disgraces adorn him, his burthens ease him; his duties are privileges, his falls are the grounds of advancement, his very sins (as bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding contrition, humility, circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and vigilance) do better and profit him: whereas Impiety doth spoil every condition, doth corrupt and embase all good things, doth embitter all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies and comforts of life.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Piety doth virtually comprise within it all other profits, serving all the designs of them all: what-ever kind of desirable good we can hope to find from any other profit, we may be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to enjoy from it.</p>
               <p>He that hath it is <hi>ipso facto</hi> vastly rich, is entitled to immense treasures of most precious Wealth; in comparison whereto all the gold and all the jewels in the world are meer baubles.

               <p>Farther, the Pious man is enabled and disposed (hath the power and the heart) most to benefit and oblige others. He doeth it by his succour and assistence, by his instruction and advice, which he is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104623:37"/>
ever ready to yield to any man upon fit occasion: he doeth it by the direction and encouragement of his good Example: he doeth it by his constant and earnest Prayers for all men: he doeth it by drawing down Blessings from Heaven on the place where he resideth. He is upon all accounts the most true, the most common benefactour to mankind; all his neighbours, his Country, the World are in some way or other obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to him: at least, he doeth all the good he can, and in wish doth benefit all men.</p>
               <p>Thus all the fruits and consequences of Profit, the which engage men so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly to pursue it, do in the best kind and highest degree result from Piety, and, indeed, onely from it. All the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical <hi>Bravado's</hi> concerning a Wise man being onely rich, onely honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, onely happy, onely above fortune, are verified in the Pious man: to him alone, as such, with a sure foundation, without vanity, with evident reason those Aphorisms may be applied. They are Paradoxes and fictions abstracting from Religion, or considering men one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the light and power of nature: but supposing our Religion true, a good
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104623:38"/>
Christian soberly, without arrogance, in proportion and according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his Piety, may assume them to himself, as the H. Apostles did; <hi>I posses all things, I can doe all things,</hi> he may in a sort say after S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for all other Profits, secluding it, they are but imaginary and counterfeit, <note place="margin">Sen. <hi>Ep.</hi> 59.</note> meer shadows and illusions, yielding onely painted shows in stead of substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial fruit.</p>
               <p>If from bare worldly wealth (that which usurpeth the name of Profit here) a man seeketh Honour, he is deluded, for he is not thereby truly honourable; he is but a shining Earth-worm, a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapped Ass, a gaudy Statue, a theatrical Grandee: with God, who judgeth most rightly, he is mean and despicable; no intelligent person can inwardly respect him. Even here (in this World of falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and dotage) the wisest and soberest men, whose judgment usually doth sway that of others, cannot but contemn him, as Master of no real good, nor fit for any good purpose; as seeing that in the end he will prove most beggarly and wretched.</p>
               <p>If a man affecteth Power thence, he is grievously mistaken; for, in stead
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104623:38"/>
thereof, he proveth exceedingly feeble and impotent, able to perform nothing worthy a man, subject to fond humours and passions, servant to divers lusts and pleasures, <hi>captivated by the Devil at his pleasure,</hi> overborn by temptation, hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the stream of the World, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the stroaks of fortune.</p>
               <p>If he propoundeth to himself thence the enjoyment of Pleasure, he will also much fail therein: for in lieu thereof he shall find care and trouble, surfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and disease, wearisome satiety and bitter regret; being void of all true delight in his mind, and satisfaction in his Conscience; nothing here being able to furnish solid and stable pleasure.</p>
               <p>If he fansieth Safety, he deludeth himself: for how can he be safe, who is destitute of God's protection and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour; who is the object of Divine wrath and vengeance; who is assailed by many fierce and powerfull enemies; whom the roaring Lion is ready to devour; whom Death and <hi>sudden destruction</hi> are <note place="margin">

               <p>Ease he cannot obtain, being oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with unwieldy burthens of sin, of care, of trouble; being tossed with rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less agitations of lust and passion; being <hi>like the troubled sea, which cannot rest,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>He is, in fine, extremely mistaken, and in all his projects will be lamentably disappointed, whoever fansieth any true profit without Piety: he never can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to be so much as wealthy; but drudge and plod what he can, must be a beggar, and a forlorn wretch. For how can he be any wise rich, who doth want
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104623:39"/>
all the best things, the onely valuable things in the world, which any man may have, which any good man doth possess? How can he be rich, who is destitute of the most needfull accommodations of life; who constantly feedeth on the coursest and most sordid fare, (the dust of pelf, the dung of sensuality;) who hath no faithfull or constant friends; (nothing earthly can be such;) who is master of nothing but dirt, or chaffe, or smoak? Whereas also Riches do consist, not in what one enjoyeth at present, (for that can be little) but in a presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ability to enjoy afterward what he may come to need or desire; or in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded hopes that he shall never fall into want or distress. How can that man be rich, who hath not any confidence in God, any interest in him, any reason to expect his Blessing? yea, who hath much ground to fear the displeasure of him, in whose hand all things are, and who arbitrarily disposeth of all? Piety therefore is the onely profitable thing, according to just esteem. <hi>She is more</hi>

His Providence hath not ceased to watch over us, his Bounty doth not fail toward us even in this respect; his Care will not be wanting to feed us and cloath us comfortably, to protect us from evil, to prosper our good underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings.

               <p>But farther to evidence and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this point, I might propound cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain peculiar Advantages arising from Piety, which have a very general influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon our lives, and do afford un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them exceeding benefit: but this I must, in regard to the time and your patience, at present forbear.</p>

               <p>IN discoursing formerly upon these words, I did propound divers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Considerations, serving to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and recommend this Assertion of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> I shall now insist upon some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more particular, which yet seem much conducible to the same purpose, declaring the vast Utility of Religion or Piety.</p>

               <p>What therefore Law and Government are to the publick, things necessary to preserve the world in order, peace and safety, (that men may know what to doe, and distinguish what is their own,) that is Piety to each man's private state, and to ordinary conversation: it freeth a man's own life from disorder and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction; it prompteth men how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves toward one another with security and confidence.</p>
               <p>This it doeth by confining our prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice within settled bounds: but this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage appeareth greater, considering
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104623:46"/>
that the Rules which it prescribeth are the best that can be. Such they must needs be, as proceeding from infallible Wisedom and immense Goodness; being indeed no other then Laws which the All-wise and most gracious Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the world, out of tender kindness to his subjects and creatures, with espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial regard to our welfare, hath been pleased to enact and declare.

                  <hi>good:</hi> as such it is recommended to us by its Authour, so we Christians are by many great Arguments assured that it is, and that it is such even our natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son dictateth; so (as to the chief instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof) the most wise and sober men always have acknowledged, so the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral consent doth avow, and so even common experience doth attest. For, heartily to love and reverence the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all things, who by every thing apparent before us demonstrateth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self incomprehensibly powerfull, wise, and good, to be kind and charitable to our neighbours, to be just and faithfull in our dealings, to be sober and modest in our minds, to be meek and gentle in our demeanours, to be staunch and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in our enjoyments, and the like principal rules of duty, are such, that the common reason of men and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual experience do approve them, as hugely conducible to the publick good of men, and to each man's private wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. So notoriously beneficial they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that for the justification of them
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104623:47"/>
we might appeal even to the judgment and conscience of those persons who are most concerned to derogate from them. For hardly can any man be so senseless or so lewd, as seriously to disapprove or condemn them, as inwardly to blame or slight those who truly act according to them. The will of men sometimes may be so depraved, that dissolute persons wantonly and heedlesly may scoff at, and seem to disparage goodness; that good men by very bad men for doing well may be envied and hated: (their being so treated is commonly an argument of the goodness of their persons and of their ways:) but the Understanding of men can hardly be so corrupted, that Piety, Charity, Justice, Temperance, Meekness can in good earnest considerately by any man be disallowed, or that persons appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently practising them can be despised; but rather, in spite of all contrary preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and disaffections, such things and such persons cannot but in judgment and heart be esteemed by all men. The luster of them by a natural and necessary effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy (like that of Heaven's glorious light) dazzleth the sight, and charmeth the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of all men living; the beauty of them irresistibly conquereth and commandeth
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104623:48"/>
in the apprehensions of men: the more they are observed, the more usefull and needfull they appear for the good of men; all the fruits which grow from the observance of them being to all mens tast very pleasant, to all mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience very wholsome. Indeed, all the good whereby common life is ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is sweetned, is rendred pleasant and desirable, doth spring thence; all the mischiefs which infest particular men, and which disturb the world, palpably do arise from the transgression or neglect thereof.</p>
               <p>If we look on a person sticking to those Rules, we shall perceive him to have a chearfull mind and composed pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, to be at peace within and satisfied with himself; to live in comely order, in good repute, in fair correspondence and firm concord with his neighbours. If we mark what preserveth the body sound and lusty, what keepeth the mind vigorous and brisk, what saveth and improveth the estate, what up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth the good name, what guardeth and graceth a man's whole life; it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but proceeding in our demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dealings according to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and wise Rules of Piety. If we
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104623:48"/>
view a place where these commonly in good measure are observed, we shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that Peace and Prosperity do flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish there; that all things proceed on sweetly and fairly; that men generally drive on conversation and commerce to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether contentedly, delightfully, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageously, yielding friendly advice and aid mutually, striving to render one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother happy; that few clamours or complaints are heard there, few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions or stirs do appear, few disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters or tragedies do occurre; that such a place hath indeed much of the face, much of the substance of Paradise.</p>
               <p>But if you mind a person who neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them, you will find his mind galled with sore remorse, racked with anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fears and doubts, agitated with storms of passion and lust, living in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and disgrace, jarring with others, and no less dissatisfied with himself. If you observe what doth impair the health, doth weaken and fret the mind, doth waste the estate, doth blemish the reputation, doth expose the whole life to danger and trouble; what is it but thwarting these good Rules? If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider a place where these are much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, it will appear like a wilderness
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104623:49"/>
of savage Beasts, or a sty of foul Swine, or a hell of cursed Fiends; full of roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and tearing, of factions and fewds, of distractions and confusions, of pitifull objects, of dolefull moans, of tragical events. Men are there wallowing in filth, wildly revelling, bickering and squabbling, defaming, circumventing, disturbing and vexing one another; as if they affected nothing more then to render one another as miserable as they can. It is from lust and luxury, from am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and avarice, from envy and spite, and the like dispositions, which Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on chiefly doth interdict, that all such horrid mischiefs do spring.</p>
               <p>In fine, the Precepts of Religion are no other, then such as Physicians would prescribe for the health of our Bodies, as Politicians would avow needfull for the peace of the State, as <hi>Epicurean</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers do recommend for the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of our Mind, and pleasure of our lives; such as common reason dictateth, and daily trial sheweth conducible to our welfare in all respects: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, were there no law exacting them of us, we should in wisedom chuse to observe, and voluntarily impose on our selves, confessing them to be fit mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104623:49"/>
of law, as most advantageous and requisite to the good (general and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular) of mankind. So that what <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth <hi>Solon</hi> to have said, <note place="margin">Plut. <hi>in Sol.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>he had so squared his Laws to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, that all of them might clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that to observe them was more for their benefit and interest, then to violate them,</hi> is far more true concerning the Divine Laws.</p>
               <p n="2">II. We may consider more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Piety yieldeth to the practiser all kind of interiour Content, Peace, and Joy; freeth him from all kinds of dissatisfaction, regret, and disquiet; which is an inestimably-great advantage: for certainly the Happiness and Misery of men are wholly or chiefly seated and founded in the Mind. If that is in a good state of health, rest and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, what-ever the person's outward condition or circumstances be, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wretched: if that be distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or disturbed, he cannot be happy. For what if a man seem very poor; if he be abundantly satisfied in his own possessions and enjoyments? What if he tasteth not the pleasures of sense; if he enjoyeth purer and sweeter delights of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104623:50"/>
mind? What if tempests of fortune sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round him; if his mind be calm and serene? What if he have few or no friends; if he yet be throughly in peace and amity with himself, and can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully converse with his own thoughts? What if men slight, censure, or revile him; if he doth value his own state, doth approve his own actions, doth acquit himself of blame in his own conscience? Such external contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies can surely no more prejudice a man's real Happiness, then winds bluste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring abroad can harm or trouble him that abideth in a good room within doors, then storms and fluctuations at sea can molest him who standeth firm upon the shore. On the other hand, the greatest affluence of seeming goods will avail nothing, if real content of mind be wanting. For what will the highest eminence of outward state import to him that is dejected in his own conceit? What if the world court and bless him, or if all people do admire and applaud him; if he be displeased with, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth, <note place="margin">Prov. 18. 4.</note> if he despiseth himself? What if the weather look fair and bright without, if storms rage in his breast, if black clouds do overcast his Soul?

               <p>Now that from the practice of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and from it alone, such inward content and pleasure do spring; that it onely ministreth reason of content, and disposeth the mind to enjoy it; that it extirpateth the grounds and roots of discontent; that it is the onely mother of true, sober alacrity and tranquillity of mind, will, upon considering things, be manifest.</p>
               <p>There is no other thing here in this world that can yield any solid or stable content to our mind. For all present enjoyments are transient and evanid; and of any future thing, in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <note place="margin">Prov. 27. 24.</note> of change and contingency, there can be no assurance.

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:104623:51"/>
or to appease our squeamish deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. There is nothing whose sweetness we do not presently exhaust and suck dry; whereof thence we do not soon grow weary, quite loathing, or faintly liking it. There is not any thing which is not slippery and fleeting; so that we can for a long time hope to possess it, or for any time can enjoy it, without restless care in keeping it, and anxious fear of losing it. Nothing there is, in the pursuance, the custody, the defence and maintenance whereof we are not liable to disappointments and crosses. Nothing consequently there is produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of any sound content to the fasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, impatient, greedy and restless heart of man. The greatest confluence of present, corporeal, secular things (of all the health, the riches, the dignity, the power, the friendships and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, the wit, the learning and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the reputation and renown in this world) will not afford much of it: which yet is but an imaginary suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for in effect hardly do all such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations of life concurre in any state. There is ever some <hi>dead fly</hi> in our <note place="margin">Eccles 10. 1.</note> box, which marreth our <hi>ointment;</hi> some adherent inconvenience, which soureth

If therefore we would find content, we must not seek it here; we must want it, or have it from another world: it must come hither from Heaven, and thence onely Piety can fetch it down. This, in stead of these unsatisfying, uncertain and unstable things, supplieth us with goods adequate to our most outstretched wishes, infallibly sure, incessantly dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; <hi>an indefectible treasure, an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible</hi>

What is Poverty to him, for whom God is concerned to provide?

What is Disgrace to him, that hath the regard and approbation of God? What is Danger to him, whom God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally protecteth?

What is any thing to him, who is sensible that all things are purposely disposed to him by that Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which perfectly knoweth what is best, by that Goodness which entirely loveth him? In fine, he that is conscious to himself of being well-affected in mind, and acting the best way, who is satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the state of his Soul, secure from God's displeasure, and hopefull of his favour, what can make any grievous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression on him? What other affections then such as are most gratefull and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant can lodge in his Soul? Joy and Peace have natural seeds in such a mind, and necessarily must spring up there: (in proportion, I mean, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the degrees of Piety resident therein.)</p>
               <p>The <hi>Epicureans</hi> did conceit and boast, that having by their Atheistical explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of natural effects, and common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents here, discarded the belief and dread of Religion, they had laid a strong foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for tranquillity of mind, had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

But their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in many respects was vain and lame. They presumed of a victory which it is impossible to obtain: and supposing they had got it, their triumph would not have been so glorious, their success would not have been so great, as they pretended. For seeing no <hi>Epicurean</hi> Discourse can baffle the potent argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which persuade Religion; (those arguments which the visible constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nature, the current Tradition of all Ages, the general Consent of men, the pregnant attestations of History and Experience concerning supernatural and miraculous events do afford;) since the Being and Providence of God have proofs so clear and valid, that no subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of man can so far evade them, as not to be shaken with them, as wholly to be freed from doubt and suspicion of their truth; since there can be no means of evincing the negative part in those
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104623:53"/>
questions to be true or probable; it is impossible that any considering man, in this cause against Religion, should sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose himself to have acquired an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and secure victory; or that he should reap substantial fruit of comfort thence. It cannot be, that any man should enjoy any perfect quiet, without acting so as to get some good hope of avoiding those dreadfull mischiefs which Religion threatneth to the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of its Precepts. Were there indeed but reason enough to stir, if not to stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, an Infidel; were it somewhat du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious whether, yea, were it great odds that there are not reserved any punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for impiety, as indeed there is, if not the perfectest assurance imaginable, yet vast advantage on the contrary side; were there but any small reason for a Judgment to come, as there are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently very many and great ones; had most men conspired in denying Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as ever generally they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in avowing it; were there a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of miracles for establishing the Mortality and Impunity of Souls, as there have been numberless, strongly testified by good witnesses and great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, to confirm the opposite doctrines;

did most wise and sober men judge in favour of Irreligion, as commonly they ever did and still do otherwise: yet wisedom would require that men should chuse to be pious, since otherwise no man can be throughly secure.

To be in the least obnoxious to eternal Torments, if men would think upon it as men, (that is, as rational and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident creatures,) could not but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb them. And indeed so it is in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: for what-ever they say or seem, all Atheists and profane men are inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suspicious and fearfull; they care not to dy, and would gladly scape the trial of what shall follow death. But let us grant or imagine the <hi>Epicurean</hi> success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as he could wish in this enterprize of subduing Religion: yet except there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he can also trample down Reason, new mould humane nature, subjugate all natural appetites and passions, alter the state of things here, and transform the world, he will yet in greatest part fail of his conceited advantages; very short he will fall of triumphing in a, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104623:54"/>
and quiet mind. That which accrueth thence will at most be no more then some negative content, or a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al indolency, arising from his being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scued from some particular cares and fears; which exceedeth not the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of a beast, or the stupidity of one that is out of his senses: that is all he can claim, which yet is more then he can ever compass. For he cannot be as a Beast, or a meer Sot, if he would: Reason, reflecting on present evils, and boding others future, will afflict him; his own unsatiable desires, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable fears and untameable passions will disquiet him. Were the other world quite out of his faith or his thought, yet this world would yield trouble sufficient to render him void of any steddy rest, or solid joy. All men ever have, and ever will complain, that the burthens, crosses, satieties of this life, do much surpass the conveniences and comforts of it. So that, were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be expected or feared, this of it self would become grievous and nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; <note place="margin">

We may adde, that had those profane attempters quite banished Religion, they with it must have driven away all the benefits and comforts of it; which, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven supposing them but imaginary, are yet the greatest which common life doth need, or can desire: with it they would send packing Justice, Fidelity, Charity, Sobriety, and all solid Vertue, things which cannot firmly subsist without Conscience: which being gone, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life would be the most disorderly, most unsafe, most wretched and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible thing that can be; nothing but insipid and flashy sensualities would be left behind to comfort a man with; and those hardly any man (by reason of competitions and contentions for them, no-wise restrainable) could enjoy quietly, or safely. It is therefore Piety alone, which, by raising hopes of blessings and joys incomparably superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to any here, that cannot be taken from us, can lay any ground of true content, of substantial and positive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104623:55"/>
such as consisteth not onely in removing the objects and causes of vexatious passions, but in employing the most pleasant affections (love, hope, joy,) with a delightfull complacence upon their proper and most noble ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. <hi>The Kingdom of God</hi> (and that <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note> onely, no other Kingdom hath that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege) <hi>consisteth in righteousness,</hi> (first, then in) <hi>peace and spiritual joy.</hi> No Philosopher, with truth and reason, can make that overture to us which our Lord doth; <hi>Come unto me, all ye that are</hi>

               <p>Doth it result from a well governing and ordering our Passions?

               <p>Doth Content grow from a sound and healthfull constitution of Soul? It is the pious man alone that hath that, whose mind is clear from distempers of vice and passion.

what seemeth good and prosperous is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such to him, as meant for his good by the Divine Goodness, as tending thereto by the guidance of infallible Wisedom.

him the utmost good that he is capable of. And farther,</p>
               <p n="3">III. Seeing we have mentioned Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, or the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most scope of humane desire, we do adde, that Piety doth surely confer it. Happiness, what-ever it be, hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly an essential coherence with Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. These are reciprocal Propositions, both of them infallibly true, He that is pious is happy; and, He that is happy is pious. No man doth undertake or prosecute any thing, which he doth not apprehend in some order or degree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to that which all men under a confused notion regard and tend to, which they call Happiness, the highest Good, the chiefest desirable thing. But in their judgments about this thing, or the means of attaining it, as men dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent much; so of necessity most of them must be mistaken. Most, indeed, do aim and shoot at a meer shadow of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, or at that which is very little consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and in comparison nothing at all; which little conduceth to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their nature, or the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their desire. If they miss the mark, they are disappointed; if they hit it,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104623:58"/>
they are no less, and in effect hit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But what-ever this grand mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, in what-ever it consisteth, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be procured; be it the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fruition of some special choice goods, or an aggregation and affluence of all goods; Piety surely is the main ingredient, and principal cause thereof. All other goods without it are insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant and unusefull thereto; and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wanting, where Piety is. Be a man never so rich, so powerfull, so lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and knowing, so prosperous in his affairs, so honourable in the opinions and affections of men: yet no-wise hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py can he be, if he is not pious; being he wanteth the best goods, and is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the worst evils; being he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the love and favour of God, he wanteth peace and satisfaction of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, he wanteth a right enjoyment of present things, he wanteth security concerning his final welfare. Be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so poor, so low in the eyes of men, so forlorn and destitute of worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies; yet if he be pious, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wretched: for he hath an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in goods incomparably most preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and is safe from all considerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; he hath a free resort to the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustible
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104623:58"/>
fountain of all Happiness, he hath a right to immense and endless Felicity, the which eminently contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all the goods we are capable of; he is possessed thereof in hope, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reversion, there is but a moment to pass before his complete fruition of it. The want of all other petty things no more can maim the integrity of his Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, then cutting the hair, or paring the nails, do mutilate a man: all other things are but superfluities or excrescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in regard to the constitution of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. What-ever happeneth, that will assuredly be true, which is so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated in H. Scripture, <hi>Blessed is every</hi>

To the love <note place="margin">Matt. 5.</note> of God, to charity toward our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to purity of heart, to meekness, to humility, to patience, to mercifulness, to peaceableness Beatitude is ascribed by our Lord, (the great Judge and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penser of it.) Each religious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance hath happy fruits growing from it, and blissfull rewards assigned thereto. All pious dispositions are fountains of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104623:59"/>
pleasant streams, which by their conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence do make up a full sea of Felicity.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It is a peculiar advantage of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it furnisheth employment fit for us, worthy of us, hugely gratefull, and highly beneficial to us. Man is a very busie and active creature, which cannot live and doe nothing, whose thoughts are in restless motion, whose desires are ever stretching at somewhat, who perpetually will be working either good or evil to himself: wherefore greatly profitable must that thing be which determineth him to act well, to spend his care and pain on that which is truly advantageous to him; and that is Religion onely. It alone fastneth our thoughts, affections and endeavours, upon occupations worthy the dignity of our nature, suting the excellency of our natural capacities and endowments, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the perfection and advancement of our Reason, to the enriching and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobling of our Souls. Secluding that, we have nothing in the world to study, to affect, to pursue, not very mean and below us, not very base and misbeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming us, as men of reason and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What have we to doe but to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104623:59"/>
eat and drink, like horses or like swine; but to sport and play, like children or apes; but to bicker and scuffle about trifles and impertinencies, like idiots? what, but to scrape or scramble for use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less pelf; to hunt after empty shews and shadows of honour, or the vain fancies and dreams of men? what, but to wallow or bask in sordid pleasures, the which soon degenerate into remorse and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness? To which sort of employments were a man confined, what a pitifull thing would he be, and how inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable were his life? Were a man design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely, like a flie, to buzz about here for a time, sucking in the air, and licking the dew, then soon to vanish back into nothing, or to be transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into worms; how sorry and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable a thing were he? And such with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Religion we should be. But it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth us with business of a most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy nature, and lofty importance; it setteth us upon doing things great and noble as can be; it engageth us to free our minds from all fond conceits, and cleanse our hearts from all corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; to curb our brutish appetites, to tame our wild passions, to correct our perverse inclinations, to conform the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104623:60"/>
dispositions of our Soul and the actions of our life to the eternal laws of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and goodness: it putteth us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the imitation of God, and aiming at the resemblance of his perfections; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on obtaining a friendship, and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a correspondence with the High and Holy one; upon fitting our minds for conversation and society with the wisest and purest Spirits above; upon providing for an immortal state; upon the acquist of joy and glory everlasting. It employeth us in the divinest actions, of promoting Vertue, of performing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence, of serving the publick, and doing good to all: the being exercised in which things doth indeed render a man highly considerable, and his life excellently valuable.</p>
               <p>'Tis an employment most proper to us as reasonable men. For what more proper entertainments can our mind have, then to be purifying and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying it self, to be keeping it self and its subordinate faculties in order, to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon the management of thoughts, of passions, of words, of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions depending upon its governance?</p>
               <p>'Tis an employment most beneficial to us: in pursuing which we greatly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104623:60"/>
better our selves, and improve our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; we benefit and oblige others; we procure sound reputation, and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy friendships; we decline many irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some mischiefs and annoyances; <hi>we do</hi> not (like those in the Prophet) <hi>spend</hi>

                  <hi>our labour for that which satisfieth not, nor spend our mony for that which is not bread:</hi> for both temporal prosperity and eternal felicity are the wages of the labour which we take herein.</p>
               <p>'Tis an employment most constant, never allowing sloth or listlessness to creep in, incessantly busying all our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties with earnest contention; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that profession of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the nature thereof, <hi>Herein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do I exercise my self, to have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>

               <p>THE words are in the strictest sense the word of God, uttered immediately by God himself; and may thence command from us an especial attention and regard. The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of that which occasioned them is, I presume, well known, neither shall I make any descant or reflexion thereon; but do take the words separately, as a Proposition of it self, affording a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat instruction, and ample matter of discourse. And as such, they plainly imply two things: a Duty required of us, to <hi>honour God;</hi> and a Reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to us, upon performance of that Duty, being <hi>honoured by God.</hi> It is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for us, before we are willing to undertake any work, to consider the reward or benefit accruing from it; and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104623:66"/>
it is necessary, before we can perform any duty, to understand the nature thereof. To this our method of action I shall suit the method of my Discourse; first endeavouring to estimate the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, then to explain the Duty. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward I mean to shew briefly why in reason the Duty is injoyned; how in effect the Reward is conferred.</p>

For it self, it is Honour; a thing, if valued according to the rate it bears in the common market, of highest price among all the objects of humane desire; the chief reward which the greatest actions, and which the best actions do pretend unto, or are capable of; that which usually bears most sway in the hearts, and hath strongest influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the lives of men: the desire of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and maintaining which doth commonly overbear other most potent inclinations.

lends an assisting hand to his attempts, grants a ready credence to his testimony, and makes a fair construction of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whom he esteems and respects.

               <p>But searching farther, we shall find the appetite of Honour to have a dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ground, and that it is rooted even in our Nature it self. For we may descry it budding forth in mens first Infancy, (before the use of reason, or speech;) even little Children being ambitious to <note place="margin">

We may observe it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Age, waxing bigger and stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger together with the encrease of wit and knowledge, of civil culture and experience: that the maturest age doth most resent and relish it; that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails most in civilized nations; that men of the best parts, of the highest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, of the weightiest employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, do most zealously affect it and stand upon it; that they who most struggle with it, do most feel its might,

how difficult it is to resist or restrain it, how impossible it is to stifle or extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish it. For the Philosopher with all his reasons and considerations cannot dispute it down, or persuade it away; the Anchoret cannot with all his auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities starve it, or by his retirements shun it: no affliction, no poverty, no wretchedness of condition can totally suppress it.

               <p>Such is the Reward propounded to us in it self; no vile or contemptible thing, but upon various accounts much

valuable; that which the common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of men, plain dictates of reason, a predominant instinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the judgments of very wise men, and Divine attestation it self conspire to commend unto us as very considerable and precious. Such a Reward our Text prescribes us the certain, the onely way of attaining.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such a benefit is here tendred to us (that which yet more highly commends it, and exceedingly enhances its worth) by God himself: <hi>I</hi> (saith he) <hi>will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> 'Tis sanctified by coming from his holy hand; 'tis dignified by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his most wise and just disposal; 'tis fortified and assured by depending on his unquestionable word, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollable power; who as he is the prime Authour of all good, so he is in especial manner the sovereign dispenser of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. <hi>The King</hi> (we say) <hi>is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of honour.</hi> What any King, as the Representative and Delegate of God, is in his particular Kingdom, that is Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God absolutely and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in all the world. <hi>Both riches and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>honour</hi> (said good King <hi>David) come of thee, for thou rulest over all: in thine hand is power and might; in thine hand</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:104623:74"/>
                  <hi>it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.</hi> He whose grants are in effect onely sure and valid, whose favours onely do in the end turn to good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he freely offers us most desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preferment: he doth himself gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously hold forth most authentick pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, by virtue of which we may all become <hi>right honourable,</hi> and <hi>persons of quality</hi> indeed; having not onely the names and titles, the outward ensigns and badges of dignity, (such as earthly Princes conferr,) but the substantial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, the assured enjoyment thereof. (For man can onely impose law upon tongues and gestures; God alone com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth and inclineth hearts, wherein Honour chiefly resideth) He offers it, I say, most freely indeed, yet not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely: he doth not goe to sell it for a price, yet he propounds it under a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; as a most just and equal, so a very gentle and easy condition. 'Tis but an exchange of Honour for Honour; of honour from God, which is a free gift, for honour from us, which is a just duty; of honour from him our so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord, for honour from us his poor vassals; of honour from the most High Majesty of Heaven, for honour
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104623:75"/>
from us vile worms creeping upon earth. Such an overture one would think it not onely reasonable to accept, but impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to refuse. For can any man dare not to honour invincible Power, infallible Wisedom, inflexible Justice? will any man forbear to honour immense Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Bounty? Yes, it seems there are men so mad as to reject so fair an offer, so bad as to neglect so equal a duty. Let us therefore consider what it is that is here required of us, or wherein this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of God consists, that we may thereby discern when we perform this duty, when we are deficient therein.</p>
               <p n="2">II. There are several ways of honouring God, or several parts and degrees of this Duty; all which we may referr to two sorts, conceiving the Duty as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound made up of two main ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, (correspondent to those two parts in which they reside, and of which our nature consists; which distinction S. <hi>Paul</hi> suggesteth, when he saith, <hi>Glorifie God</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's,)</hi> one of them being, as it were, the form and Soul, the other as the matter and Body of the Duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Soul of that Honour which
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:104623:75"/>
is required of us toward God, is that internal esteem and reverence which we should bear in our hearts towards him; importing that we have impressed upon our minds such conceptions about him as are worthy of him, sutable to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his nature, to the eminency of his state, to the just quality of his works and actions: that we apprehend him to be, what he really is, in his nature, superlatively good, wise, powerfull, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and just: that we ascribe unto him the production and conservation of all beings, together with an intire superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency over and absolute disposal of all events: that we conceive our selves obliged to submit unto and acquiesce in all his dispensations of Providence, as most wise and most righteous; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the declarations of his mind, (whether in way of assertion, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,) as infallibly true and certain. In such acts of mind the honouring of God doth primarily consist. In Acts, I say: not in speculative Opinions concerning the Divine Excellencies, (such as all men have, who are not downright A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists or Infidels,) floating in the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or dormant in the mind; but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually-present, lively, effectual acts of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104623:76"/>
apprehension and judgment, sinking down into the heart and affections, and quickning them to a congruous reall performance. Such an apprehension of God's Power, as shall make us to dread his irresistible hand, shall cause us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair of prospering in bad courses, shall dispose us to confide in him, as able to perform what-ever he wills us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from him: such an opinion of his Wisedom, as shall keep us from questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whether that is best which God declares to be so; as shall hinder us from presuming (in compliance with our own shallow reason, or vain fancy) to doe any thing against God's judgment and advice: such a conceit of God's Justice, as shall render us carefull to perform what his Law promises to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and fearfull to commit what it threatens to punish: such a persuasion concerning God's Goodness, as shall kindle in us an hearty affection toward him, shall make us very sensible of his bounty, and ready to yield returns of duty and gratitude unto him; as shall preserve us from being distrustfull of his Providence, or doubtfull in our need and distress of finding relief from him: such a vigorous and fruitfull esteem of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104623:76"/>
God in all respects, as shall produce in as dispositions of mind, and actions of life, agreeable to our various relations and obligations to him; becoming us as his creatures and children, as his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and servants. This is indeed the Soul of the duty, which being absent, all exteriour (how specious soever) either professions or performances are but as pictures, having in them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of resemblance in shape and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, nothing of life: yea rather, as carkases, not onely dead and senseless; but rotten and filthy in God's sight. <hi>This people</hi> (saith God) <hi>do honour me with their lips, but their heart is far</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 15. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>from me.</hi> Such honour is indeed no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour at all, but impudent abuse and profane mockery: for what can be more abominably vain, then for a man to court and cajoul him who knows his whole heart, who sees that he either minds not, or means not what he says? It behoves us therefore by all proper means (by contemplating the Works and actions of God, (his admirable works of Nature, the wise proceedings of his Providence, the glorious dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of his Grace) by meditating on his Word, by praying for his Grace, by
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104623:77"/>
observing his Laws and will) to raise up in our hearts, to foment and cherish this internal Reverence, which is the true spring of all Piety, the principle which forms and actuates that other sort, coming next to be touched on, being the Body of our due Honour to God; concurring in its order to the integrity thereof, as without which the interiour part would be a kind of Ghost, too thin in substance, too remote from sense, too destitute of good fruit and use.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Bodily part consists in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expressions and performances, whereby we declare our esteem and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of God, and produce or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the like in others. For our thus honouring God respects those two ends and effects, the uttering our own, the exciting in others a reverence toward him. And it we may first view in the general, or gross bulk thereof; then sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey its principal members.</p>
               <p>First, in general, God is honoured by a willing and carefull practice of all Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Vertue for conscience sake, or in avowed obedience to his holy will. This is the most natural expression of our Reverence toward him, and the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104623:77"/>
most effectual way of promoting the same in others. A Subject cannot better demonstrate the Reverence he bears to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his Prince, then by (with a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diligence) observing his Laws: for by so doing he declares that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the Authority, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Majesty which enacted them; that he approves the Wisedom which devised them, and the Goodness which designed them for publick benefit; that he dreads his Prince's Power, which can maintain them, and his Justice, which will vindicate them; that he relies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Fidelity, in making good what of protection or of recompence he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds to the observers of them. No less pregnant a signification of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence toward God do we yield in our gladly and strictly obeying his Laws; thereby evidencing our submission to God's sovereign Authority, our esteem of his Wisedom and Goodness, our aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full regard to his Power and Justice, our confidence in him, and dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his word. As also the practice of wholsome Laws, visibly producing good fruits, (peace and prosperity in the commonwealth,) doth conciliate respect unto the Prince, he thereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104623:78"/>
wise and good, able to discern, and willing to chuse what conferrs to publick benefit: so actions conformable to the Divine Law, being (by God's wise and gracious disposal) both in themselves comely and lovely, and in effect (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith) <hi>good and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to men,</hi> (conducing indeed not <note place="margin">Tit. 3. 8.</note> onely to private, but also to publick <note place="margin">Neh. 9. 13.</note> welfare, to the rendring humane Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety <note place="margin">Deut. 10. 13.</note> comfortable, to the settling and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing common tranquillity,) the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them must needs bring great commendation to the authour and ordainer of them. By observing them we shall (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks) <hi>set forth the vertues of him that called us</hi> to such a <note place="margin">1 Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 2. 9.</note> practice. The light and lustre of good works, done in regard to Divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, will cause men to see clearly the Excellencies of our most wise and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord; will consequently induce and excite them <hi>to glorifie our Father which is in Heaven. In this</hi> (saith our <note place="margin">

               <p>These signal instances of this duty (represented as such in Holy Scripture) for brevitie's sake I pass over; craving leave onely to consider one, most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to our present business, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a very comprehensive one; which is this:</p>
               <p n="7">7. We shall especially honour God, by discharging faithfully those offices which God hath intrusted us with; by improving diligently those talents which God hath committed to us; by using carefully those means and opportunities, which God hath vouchsafed us, of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him service, and promoting his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Thus he to whom God hath given Wealth, if he expend it (not to the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:104623:80"/>
nourishment of pride and luxury, not onely to the gratifying his own pleasure or humour, but) to the furtherance of God's honour, or to the succour of his indigent neighbour, (in any pious or charitable way,) he doth thereby in espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner honour God. He also on whom God hath bestowed Wit and parts, if he employ them (not so much in contriving projects to advance his own petty interests, or in procuring vain applause to himself, as) in advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously setting forth God's praise, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely recommending goodness, dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously engaging men in ways of vertue, (doing which things is true wit and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent policy indeed,) he doth thereby remarkably honour God. He likewise that hath Honour conferr'd upon him, if he subordinate it to God's honour, if he use his own credit as an instrument of bringing credit to goodness, thereby adorning and illustrating Piety, he by so doing doth eminently practise this duty. The like may be said of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good quality, any capacity or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of doing good; by the right use thereof we honour God: for that men, beholding the worth of such good gifts, and feeling the benefit emergent
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104623:80"/>
from them, will be apt to bless the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of them; as did they in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, who, seeing our Saviour cure the Paralytick man, did presently <hi>glorifie</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 9. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>God, who had given such power unto men.</hi> But especially they to whom Power and Authority is committed, as they have the chief capacity, so they are under an especial obligation thus to honour God: they are particularly concerned to hear and observe that Royall proclamation, <hi>Give unto the Lord, O ye mighty, give</hi>

and oppression, all violence and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yea, (so much as may be) all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and wretchedness be prevented, or removed; when they by all means strive to promote both the service of God, and the happiness of men; <hi>(dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 24. 45.</note> equally and benignly, to the family over which their Lord hath set them, <hi>their meat in due season;</hi> providing that men under them <hi>may live a peaceable and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>quiet life in all godliness and honesty;</hi> doing which is the business allotted to them, the interest (as it were) of God, which he declares himself concernedly to tender, and by their ministry to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute:) when they carefully doe such things, then do they indeed approve themselves worthy honourers of their High Master, and Heavenly King; then do they truly act God's part, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent his person decently. When the actions of these visible Gods are so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely good and beneficial, men will be easily induced, yea, can hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to reverence and magnifie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Founder of their Authority. By so doing, as they will set before mens eyes the best pattern of Loyalty; as they will impress upon mens hearts the strongest argument for Obedience and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:104623:81"/>
respect toward themselves; as they shall both more plainly inform, and more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually persuade people to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their duty unto them, then by all the law and all the force in the world; as they will thereby conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently best secure and maintain their own honour, and their own welfare: (for men will never be heartily loyal, and submissive to Authority, till they become really good; nor will they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be very good, till they see their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders such:) so they will together great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advance the praise and glory of Him in whose name they rule, to whose fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour they owe their power and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <hi>in whose hand</hi> (as the Prophet saith) <note place="margin">Dan. 5. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>is their breath, and whose are all their ways.</hi> For all men will be ready most awfully to dread Him, unto whom they see Princes themselves humbly to stoop and bow: no man will be ashamed or unwilling to serve Him, whom he shall observe that his Lords and Governours do concern themselves to worship: the world cannot but have a good opinion of Him, a participation of whose power and majesty yields such excellent fruits; it will not fail to adore Him, whose sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and images are so venerable. 'Tis
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:104623:82"/>
a most notorious thing, both to reason and in experience, what extreme advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage Great persons have, especially by the influence of their practice, to bring God himself, as it were, into credit; how much it is in their power easily to render Piety a thing in fashion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. For in what they doe, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are alone, or are ill attended; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they goe, they carry the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them: they lead crowds of people after them, as well when they goe in the right way, as when they run astray. The custom of living well, no less then other modes and garbs, will be soon convey'd and propagated from the Court; the City and Country will readily draw good manners thence, (good manners truly so called, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly superficial forms of civility, but real practices of goodness.) For the main body of men goeth not <hi>quà eundum, sed quà itur,</hi> not according to rules and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but after examples and authorities; especially of great persons, who are like stars, shining in high and conspicuous places, by which men steer their course: their actions are to be reckon'd not as single or solitary ones, but are, like their persons, of a publick and representative
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:104623:82"/>
nature, involving the practice of others, who are by them awed, or shamed into compliance. Their good example espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially hath this advantage, that men can find no excuse, can have no pretence why they should not follow it. Piety is not onely beautified, but fortified by their dignity; it not onely shines in them with a clearer lustre, but with a mightier force and influence: a word, a look (the least intimation) from them will doe more good, then others best eloquence, clearest reason, most earnest endeavours. For it is in them, if they would apply themselves to it, as the wisest Prince implies, to <hi>scatter ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity with their eyes.</hi> A smile of theirs <note place="margin">Prov. 20. 8.</note> were able to enliven Vertue, and diffuse it all about; a frown might suffice to mortifie and dissipate wickedness. Such apparently is their power of honouring God; and in proportion thereto surely great is their obligation to doe it: of them peculiarly God expects it, and all equity exacts it. What the meaner rank of servants (who are employ'd in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser drudgeries, whose fare is more course, whose wages are more scant, who stand at greater distance from their Lord, and receive no such ample or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:104623:83"/>
marks of his favour, what these) doe is of some consequence indeed, but doth not import so much to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's reputation; their good word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, their good carriage toward him doth not credit him so much. But those whom he employs in matters of highest trust, and importance to his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, whom he places in the nearest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree unto himself, (seats even in his own throne, upon his own tribunal,) whom he feeds plentifully and daintily, maintains in a handsome garb, allows largely, as their deportment doth much reflect on their Lord's esteem, as they are highly capable of advancing his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; so all the rules of ingenuity and gratitude, all the laws of justice and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity do oblige them earnestly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour it. And it is indeed no less their concernment to doe so. For if there be disorders, prejudicial to the Master's honour and interest, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed in the family, 'tis those servants must be responsible: if due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be there kept to his glory and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, they shall chiefly be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and peculiarly hear the <hi>Euge, bone</hi>

vertues, as their behaviour hath respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively contributed to them. Those uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Rules of equity, proposed in the Gospel, will, in God's reckoning with and requiting men, be punctually obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: <hi>To whomsoever much is given, of him much shall be required:</hi> answerable to the improvement of what is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in trust, shall the acceptance be.</p>
               <p>I have insisted somewhat more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on this point, because our Text hath a particular aspect thereon; the words being uttered upon occasion of <hi>Eli,</hi> then Judge in <hi>Israel,</hi> his not using au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to these purposes; his forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to redress a grievous abuse, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by his own Sons, to the disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and dishonour of God. Whence to persons of his rank is this law especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally directed; upon them is this duty chiefly incumbent; on them assuredly, (as sure as God is true,) if they will observe the Duty, the Reward shall be conferred. God will certainly not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preserve the Honour they have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but will accumulate more Honours on them.</p>
               <p>These are general Truths; the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular application of them is ours. God, I pray, vouchsafe his grace and blessing,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:104623:84"/>
that it may be made to our benefit and comfort.</p>
               <p n="3">III. I should now shew why the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is required of us, or how reasonable it is. I must not (and the matter is so palpable that I need not) spend many words on that. God surely doth not exact honour from us because he needs it, because he is the better for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

For (beside that he cannot want any thing without himself, that he cannot any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise need mortal breath to praise him, or hands of flesh to serve him, who hath millions of better creatures then we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely at his devotion, and can with a word create millions of millions more fitter then we to honour him) the best estimation we can have of him is much below him; the best expression we can make is very unworthy of him. He is infinitely excellent beyond what we can imagine or declare: his <hi>Name is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above all blessing and praise; his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <p>Nehem. 9. 5.</p>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>glory is above the earth and heaven.</hi> So that all our endeavours to honour him are, in comparison to what is due, but defects, and in a manner disparagements to him. 'Tis onely then (which should
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:104623:84"/>
affect our ingenuity to consider) his pure goodness that moves him, for our benefit and advantage, to demand it of us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For that to honour God is the most proper work of Reason; that for which primarily we were design'd and framed: (for as other things were made to afford the matter and occasion, so Man was designed to exercise the act of glorifying God:) whence the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof doth preserve and perfect <note place="margin">Sen. <hi>Ep.</hi> 76.</note> our nature; to neglect it being unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and monstrous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For that also it is a most pleasant duty. He is not a man (hath lost all natural ingenuity and humanity) who doth not delight to make some returns thither, where he hath found much good will, whence he hath felt great kindness. Since then all the good we have, we have received from God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, it cannot but be very pleasant to render somewhat of requital (as it were) unto him; and we can render no other but this. We cannot make God more rich, more joyfull, more happy then he is: all that we can doe is, to express our reverence toward him.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:104623:85"/>
3. For that likewise our honouring God disposes us to the imitation of him, (for what we do reverence we would resemble,) that is, to the doing those things wherein our chief perfection and happiness consists, whence our best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and joy doth spring.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In fine, for that the practice of this duty is most profitable and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to us; unto it by an eternal rule of justice our final welfare and prosperity being annexed: whence God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it to be the way and condition of our attaining that thing which we so like and prize, Honour to our selves; the which by promise he hath engaged himself to confer on those who honour him. And,</p>
               <p n="4">IV. This promise he makes good se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways: Some of them I shall briefly suggest.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The honouring God is of it self an honourable thing; the employment which ennobles Heaven it self, wherein the highest Angels do rejoyce and glory. 'Tis the greatest honour of a Servant to bring credit to his Master, of a Subject to spread his Prince's renown, and (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grounds vastly more obliging) of a
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:104623:85"/>
Creature to glorifie his Maker: that we may doe so is an honour we should be glad, may be proud of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By honouring God we are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately instated in great Honour; we enter into most noble relations, acquire most illustrious titles, enjoy most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous privileges: we become the friends and favourites of Heaven, are adopted into God's family, and are styled his Children; do obtain a free access unto him, a sure protection under him, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy assistence from him in all our needs. And what honour can exceed, can equal this?</p>
               <p n="3">3. God hath so ordered it, that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is naturally conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">

               <p n="4">4. God by his extraordinary provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as there is reason and occasion, doth interpose, so as to procure Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to them, to maintain and further their reputation, who honour him.

No envy can supplant, no slander can deface the credit of such a person; since God hath taken it into

               <p>THE world is much addicted to the Politicks; the heads of men are very busie in contrivance, and their mouths are full of talk about the ways of consulting our safety, and securing our interests. May we not therefore presume, that an infallible Maxim of Policy, proposing the most expedite and certain method of security in all our transactions, will be entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with acceptance? Such an one the greatest Politician and wisest man for business (if we may take God's own word for it) that ever was, or will be, <note place="margin">1 King. 3. 12.</note> doth here suggest to us. For the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice couched in our Text he otherwhere voucheth for a point of Policy, telling us, that <hi>A man of understanding walketh uprightly:</hi> and here he recommendeth <note place="margin">Prov. 15. 21.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Treating upon which <hi>Aphorism,</hi> I shall, by God's help, endeavour, first, in way of Explication, briefly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the practice it self; then, in way of Proof, by some Considerations to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that Security doth attend it.</p>
               <p>For Explication. <hi>To walk</hi> (as well in the style of Holy Scripture, as in other Writings, and even in common speech) doth signifie our usual course of dealing, or the constant tenour of our practice.</p>

               <p>In effect, the Phrase, <hi>He that walketh uprightly,</hi> doth import, One who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly disposed in his designs and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to bear a principal regard to the rules of his Duty, and the dictates of his <note place="margin">

               <p>For Proof. That such an one doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proceed with much security, from the following Considerations may appear.</p>
               <p n="1">I. An upright walker is secure of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily finding his way. For it commonly requireth no reach of wit or depth of judgment, no laborious diligence of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:104623:90"/>
no curious intentness of obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, no solicitous care, or plodding study, to discern in any case what is just; we need not much trouble our heads about it, for we can hardly be to seek for it. If we will but open our eyes, it lieth in view before us, being the plain, straight, obvious road, which common Reason prompteth, or which ordinary Instruction pointeth out to us: so that usually that direction of <hi>Solomon</hi> is sufficient, <hi>Let thine eyes look right on,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 4. 25, 27 &amp; 17. 24. &amp; 14. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>and let thine eye-lids look straight before thee—Turn not to the right hand, nor to the left.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ways of iniquity and vanity, (if we may call them <hi>ways,</hi> which indeed are but exorbitancies and seductions from the way,) ill designs, and bad means of executing designs, are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible, very obscure, abstruse and intricate; being infinitely various, and utterly uncertain: so that out of them to pick and fix <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>

is but asking the way of him, or saying, with the Psalmist, <hi>Shew me thy</hi>

               <p>Hence is the upright man happily se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from tiring pains in the search, from racking anxieties in the choice, from grating scruples and galling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets in the pursuit of his way.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The upright walker doth tread <note place="margin">(Prov. 12. 5.)</note> upon firm ground. He doth build his practice, not upon the perillous bogs, the treacherous quagmires, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring quick-sands of uncouth, bold, impious Paradoxes, (such as have been vented by <hi>Epicurus,</hi> by <hi>Machiavel,</hi> by others more lately, whose infamous names are too well known, as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of their pestilent notions are too
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:104623:92"/>
much felt;) but upon solid, safe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and well-tried principles; <hi>viz.</hi> these, and the like coherent with them: That there is an eternal God, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensibly powerfull, wise, just, and good; who is always present with us, and ever intent upon us; viewing not onely all our external actions, (open and secret,) but our inmost cogitations, desires, and intentions, by the which our actions chiefly are to be estimated: That He, as Governour of the world, and Judge of men, doth concern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in all humane affairs, disposing and managing all events according to his righteous pleasure; exacting punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual obedience to his laws, and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing recompences answerable thereto; with impartial justice rewarding each man according to the purposes of his heart, and the practices of his life: That all our good and happiness doth abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely depend on God's favour; so that to please him can onely be true wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to offend him the great folly: That Vertue is incomparably the best endowment whereof we are capable, and Sin the worst mischief to which we are liable: That no worldly good or evil is considerable in comparison with
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104623:92"/>
goods or evils spiritual: That nothing can be really profitable or advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to us, which doth not consist with our duty to God, doth not some-wise conduce to our spiritual interest, and eternal welfare: yea, That every thing not serviceable to those purposes is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a frivolous trifle, or a dangerous snare, or a notable dammage, or a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bane to us: That content of mind, springing from innocence of life, from the faithfull discharge of our duty, from satisfaction of Conscience, from a good hope in regard to God and our future state, is in our esteem and choice much to be preferred before all the delights which any temporal possession or frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can afford: and, That a bad mind is the sorest adversity which can befall us. Such are the grounds of upright practice, more firm then any rock, more unshakeable then the foundations of heaven and earth; the which are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Sacred Oracles, and attested by many remarkable Providences; have ever been avowed by the wiser sort, and admitted by the general consent of men, as for their truth, most agreeable to Reason, and for their usefulness, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by constant experience. The
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104623:93"/>
belief of them having apparently most wholsome influence upon all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of life, both publick and private; indeed, being absolutely needfull for upholding Government, and preserving humane Society; no obligation, no faith or confidence between men, no friendship or peace being able to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist without it. Whence the practice built on such foundations must be very secure. And if God shall not cease to be, if he will not let go the reins, if his Word cannot deceive, if the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest men are not infatuated, if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense of mankind do not prove extravagant, if the main props of life and pillars of Society do not fail; he that walketh uprightly doth proceed on sure grounds.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The upright person doth walk steddily, maintaining his principal reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and holding his main course, through all occasions, without flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching or wavering, or desultory incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence and sickleness; his integrity being an excellent ballast, holding him tight and well-poised in his deportment; so that waves of temptation dashing on him do not make him roll in uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:104623:93"/>
or topple over into unworthy prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices.</p>
               <p>Lust, passion, humour, interest, are things very mutable, as depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on temper of body, casualties of time, the winds and tides of this vertiginous world: whence he that is guided or moved by them must needs be <hi>many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded,</hi> and <hi>unstable in all his ways;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 8.</note> will <hi>reel to and fro like a drunken man,</hi>

               <p>Hence, <hi>The Hope of the righteous</hi> (as <note place="margin">Prov. 10. 28.</note> the <hi>Wise man</hi> telleth us) <hi>is gladness.</hi> He considering the goodness, the justice, the fidelity of God, whereof his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity doth render him capable and a proper object, cannot but conceive a comfortable hope of a good issue.</p>
               <p>And obtaining success, he doth not onely enjoy the material pleasure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but the formal satisfaction that it is indeed good success, or a blessing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to him by special favour of God; enabling him to say with the Psalmist, <hi>The Lord rewarded me according to my</hi>

However, an upright dealer hath this comfortable reserve, that what-ever doth befall him, however the business goeth, he shall not condemn, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish himself with remorse; he shall not want a consolation able to support and to erect his mind. He shall triumph, if not in the felicity of his success, yet in <note place="margin">(Prov. 24. 16.)</note> the integrity of his heart, and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of his deportment; even as Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Job</hi> did under all the pressures of his adversity: for, <hi>Till I die,</hi> (said he) <hi>I will not remove my integrity from me.</hi>

He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that his thoughts should be soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and his actions sifted to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. He could even wish, that his breast had windows, that his heart were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that all the world might see through him, and descry the clearness of his intentions. The more curiously his ways are marked, the more exactly his dealings are scann'd, the more thoroughly his designs are penetrated and known; the greater approbation he is sure to receive.</p>
               <p>The issue of things assuredly will be creditable to him; and when the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light hath scattered all mists, hath clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all misprisions and mistakes, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation will shine most brightly: the event declaring, that he had no corrupt ends; the course of his proceedings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing justified by the very light of things.</p>
               <p>God himself will be concerned to vindicate his reputation, not suffering

               <p>He cannot be much defeated in his purposes: for, as to his general, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, absolute designs, (that is, his design of pleasing God, and procuring his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; his design of satisfying himself, and discharging his Conscience; his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of promoting his own spiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and saving his Soul; his design of doing good, of exercising charity to his neighbour, of serving the publick, of obliging the world by vertuous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and by real beneficence,) these he cannot fail thoroughly to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish; nothing can obstruct him in the prosecution, nothing can debarre him from the execution of those underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:104623:103"/>
in spite of all the world, by the succour of that Divine grace which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doth favour and further such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, he most happily will atchieve them. And for other inferiour designs, he can hardly be crossed in regard to them: for it is an essential part of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, not otherwise to affect or aim at private secular interests, then under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and with a reservation, if it be God's pleasure, if it seem good to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wisedom. He knoweth that his pains employed on any honest purpose, in a fair way, (be it to procure some worldly advantage for himself, for his relations, for his friend,) are not lost, if they have the fruit of submission to God's will, and acquiescence in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent disposed by him. He is assured that it is good luck to have his project blasted, and that missing is better then getting, when by Sovereign Wisedom it is so determined. He therefore could not so fix his heart, or engage his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in any such concern, that his mind is surprized, or his passions discomposed by a seeming adversness of events to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. So that in effect he can have no bad success. For how can that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence be deemed bad, which plain
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104623:103"/>
reason dictateth in certain judgment to be most expedient for him; about which he ever was very indifferent, and with which at present he is not heartily displeased? How can it be taken for disappointment and misfortune, which one was prepared to embrace with satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and complacence?</p>
               <p>Yea, to a person so disposed, that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess which seemeth most adverse, justly may be reputed the best and most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as promoting ends incomparably more excellent then any worldly gain; as producing fruits exceedingly more wholsome and more savoury then any temporal commodity; as exercising and improving the divinest Vertues, (Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Patience, Meekness, Moderation, Contentedness) a grain whereof is worth all the wealth, all the preferment, all that is desirable in the world.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let the worst that can ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, (or that which humane blindness and fondness do count the worst,) yet upright persons do not come off ill, or so (matters being rightly stated) as to be losers upon the foot of the accompt.</p>
               <p>If this do not satisfie grosser appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, we may adde, that even in these meaner concerns Almighty God is

               <p>Among divers such delivered here, this is one, which shall be the Subject of my present Discourse; the which, having no other plain coherence (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by affinity of matter) with the rest enclosing it, I shall consider absolutely by it self, endeavouring somewhat to explain it, and to urge its practice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pray without ceasing.</hi> For understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding these words, let us first consider what is meant by the act injoyned, <hi>Praying;</hi> then, what the qualification or circumstance adjoyned, <hi>without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi> doth import.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The word <hi>Prayer</hi> doth in its usual latitude of acception comprehend all sorts of Devotion, or all that part of Religious practice wherein we do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately address our selves to God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by speech (oral or mental) a kind of intercourse and conversation with him. So it includeth that Praise which we should yield to God, implying our
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:104623:106"/>
due esteem of his most excellent Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, most glorious Works, most just and wise dispensations of Providence and Grace; that Thanksgiving where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we should express an affectionate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment of our obligation to him for the numberless great benefits we receive from him; that Acknowledgment of our entire dependence upon him, or our to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall subjection to his power and pleasure, together with that Profession of Faith in him, and avowing of service to him, which we do owe as his natural crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and subjects; that humble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of our infirmity, our vileness, our guilt, our misery, (joyned with depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of wrath and vengeance,) which is due from us as wretched men, and grievous sinners; that Petition of things needfull or convenient for us, (of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in our wants, of succour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in our distresses, of direction and assistence in our undertakings, of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and pardon for our offences,) which our natural state (our poor, weak, sad and sinfull state) doth engage us to seek; that Intercession for others, which general charity, or special relation do require from us, as concerned or obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to desire and promote their good.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:104623:107"/>
All these Religious performances Prayer in its larger notion doth comprise: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording whereto in common use the whole Body of Divine Service, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all such acts, is termed <hi>Prayer;</hi> and Temples, consecrated to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all holy duties, are styled <hi>Houses of prayer;</hi> and that brief Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or pregnant Form of all Devotion, which our Lord dictated, is called <hi>his Prayer:</hi> and in numberless places of Scripture it is so taken.</p>
               <p>In a stricter sense, it doth onely sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie one particular act among those, the Petition of things needfull or usefull for us.</p>
               <p>But according to the former more comprehensive meaning I chuse to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it here; both because it is most commonly so used, (then, especially, when no distinctive limitation is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, or the nature of the subject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth not restrain it,) and because general reasons do equally oblige to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all these duties in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner here prescribed: nor is there any ground to exclude any part of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from continual use; we being obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged no less incessantly to praise God for his excellencies, and thank him for his
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:104623:107"/>
benefits, to avow his Sovereign Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and Authority, to confess our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and miscarriages, then to beg help and mercy from God. All Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore, all sorts of proper and due address to God (that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>all prayer and supplication,</hi> which <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 18.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> otherwise speaketh of) are here injoyned, according to the manner adjoyned, <hi>without ceasing,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, indefinently, or continually.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the meaning of which expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, we must suppose, that it must not be understood as if we were obliged in every instant or singular point of time actually to apply our minds to this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: for to doe thus is in it self impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and therefore can be no matter of duty; it is inconsistent with other duties, and therefore must not be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised; yea, will not consist with it self; for, that we may pray, we must live, that we may live, we must eat, that we may eat, we must work, and must therefore attend other matters; so that actual Devotion neither must, nor can swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up all our time and care. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate operations of our mind are sometimes interrupted by sleep, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times will be taken up in satisfying our
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:104623:108"/>
natural appetites, sometimes must be spent in attendence upon other reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable employments, commanded or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by God; whence there can be no obligation to this practice according to that unlimited interpretation. This Precept therefore (as divers others of a like general purport and expression) must be understood, not in a natural, but moral sense, according as the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of things permitteth, or as the reason of the case requireth; so far as it is conveniently practicable, or as it is reasonably compatible with other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and needs. But we must not so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain it as to wrong it, by pinching it within too narrow bounds. How then it may be understood, and how far it should extend, we shall endeavour to declare by propounding divers senses <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Adoro Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae plenitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem.</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tull.</note> whereof it is capable, grounded upon plain testimonies of Scripture, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcible by good Reason; according to which senses we shall together press the observance thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">I. First then, <hi>Praying incessantly</hi> may import the maintaining in our Souls a ready disposition or habitual inclination to Devotion; that which in Scripture
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:104623:108"/>
is termed <hi>the spirit of supplication.</hi> This <note place="margin">Zech. 12. 10.</note> in moral esteem, and according to cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent language, derived thence, amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to a continual practice; a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reckoned and said to doe that, to which he is ever prompt and propense: as it is said of the righteous man, that <hi>he is ever mercifull, and lendeth,</hi> because <note place="margin">Psal. 37. 26.</note> he is constantly disposed to supply his neighbour with needfull relief; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <note place="margin">

The words may signifie this; they do at least by consequence imply so much: for if we do not in this, we can hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the duty in any sense; without a good temper fitting, and a good appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite prompting to Devotion, we scarce can, or will ever apply our selves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. If there be not in our heart a root of Devotion, whence should it spring? how can it live, or thrive? If the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of Prayer be out of kelter, or out of tune, how can we pray?

fixed, that is, readily <hi>prepared,</hi> and <note place="margin">(a Chr. 30. 19. Ezr. 7. 10.)</note> steddily inclined to Devotion. So should ours constantly be. As a true friend is ever ready to entertain his friend with a frank courtesie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency; as he ever is apt upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for advice and assistence to have recourse to him: so should we be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways disposed chearfully and decently to converse with God, when he freely cometh to us, or we have need to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our selves to him. If there be (from stupidity of mind, from cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of affection, from sluggishness of spirit, from worldly distraction) any indisposition or averseness thereto, we should by serious consideration and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious care labour to remove them; rousing our spirits, and kindling in our affections some fervency of desire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward spiritual things: otherwise we shall be apt to shun, or to slip the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities inviting to Devotion; our hearts will be so resty, or listless, that hardly we shall be induced to perform it, when it is most necessary or usefull for us.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Praying incessanty</hi> may denote a vigilant attendence (with earnest regard,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:104623:109"/>
and firm purpose) employed upon De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion: such attendence as men usually bestow on their affairs, whereof although the actual prosecution sometime doth stick, yet the design continually procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; the mind ever so directing its eye toward them, as quickly to espy, and readily to snatch any advantages of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting them. This is a kind of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in practice, and is commonly so termed: as we say that such an one is building a house, is writing a book, is occupying such land, although he be at present sleeping, or eating, or, following any other business; because his main design never sleepeth, and his purpose continues uninterrupted. This is that which is so often injoyned under the phrase of <hi>watching</hi> about Prayer. <hi>Watch</hi>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:104623:110"/>
slight endeavour, by fits, as the humour taketh us; but that, accounting it a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of the choicest nature and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest moment, we do adhere thereto with unmovable purpose, regard it with undistracted attention, pursue it with unwearied diligence, being always up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the guard, wakefull and expedite, intent upon, and apt to close with any occasion suggesting matter thereof. That we should doe thus reason also doth oblige: for that, as in truth no business doth better deserve our utmost resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and care, so none doth more need them; nature being so backward, and occasion so slippery, that if we do not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mind it, we shall seldom practise it.</p>

But there are some special occasions, which more importunately and indispensably do exact it: some seasons there are (either mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred by extrinsecal accidents, or sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging from internal dispositions) when, without both great blame, and much dammage to our selves, we cannot neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it: times there be most proper, and acceptable, when we do especially need to pray, and when we are likely to speed well therein. <hi>Every one</hi> (saith <note place="margin">Psal. 32. 6.</note> the Psalmist) <hi>that is godly will pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee in a time when thou mayest be found:</hi> and, <hi>My prayer</hi> (saith he again) <note place="margin">

               <p>Without this practice we cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hope to obtain those precious things; they will not come at an easie rate, or be given for a song; a lazy wish or two cannot fetch them down from Heaven. God will not bestow them at first asking, or deal them out in one lump: but it is upon assiduous soliciting, and by gradual communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he dispenseth them. So his wise good will for many special reasons disposeth him to proceed: that we may (as it becometh and behoveth us) abide under a continual sense of our natural impotency and penury; of our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon God, and obligation to him for the free collation of those best gifts: that by some difficulty of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them we may be minded of their worth, and induced the more to prize them: that by earnestly seeking them
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:104623:117"/>
we may improve our spiritual appetites, and excite holy affections: that by much conversing with Heaven, our minds may be raised above earthly things, and our hearts purified from sordid desires: that we may have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant employment answerable to the best capacities of our Souls, worthy our care and pain, yielding most solid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and pure delight unto us: that, in fine, by our greater endeavour in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious practice we may obtain a more ample reward thereof.</p>
               <p>For the same reason indeed that we pray at all, we should pray thus, with continued instance. We do not pray to instruct or advise God; not to tell him news, or inform him of our wants: <hi>(He knows them,</hi> as our Saviour telleth <note place="margin">Matt. 6. 8.</note> us, <hi>before we ask:)</hi> nor do we pray by dint of argument to persuade God, and bring him to our bent; nor that by fair speech we may cajoul him, or move his affections toward us by pathetical orations: not for any such purpose are we obliged to pray. But for that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, and it behoveth us so to doe; because it is a proper instrument of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, ennobling, and perfecting our Souls; because it breedeth most holy
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:104623:117"/>

The feeding our Souls and nourishing our spiritual life,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:104623:120"/>
the refreshing our spirits with those no less pleasant then wholsome exercises, the driving on our correspondence and commerce with Heaven, the improving our friendship and interest with God, are affairs which above all others do best deserve, and most need being secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. They must not therefore be left at random, to be done by the bye, as it hitteth by chance, or as the fancy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us. If we do not depute vacant seasons, and fix periodical returns for Devotion, engaging our selves by firm resolution, and inuring our minds by constant usage to the strict observance of them, secluding from them, as from sacred enclosures, all other businesses; we shall often be dangerously tempted to neglect it, we shall be commonly listless to it, prone to defer it, easily se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from it by the encroachment of other affairs, or enticement of other pleasures. It is requisite that our Souls also (no less then our Bodies) should have their meals, settled at such inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls as the maintenance of their life, their health, their strength and vigour do require; that they may not perish or languish for want of timely repasts; that a good appetite may duly spring
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:104623:121"/>
up, prompting and instigating to them; that a sound temper and robust consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Soul may be preserved by them.</p>
               <p>Prayers are the bulwarks of Piety and good Conscience, the which ought to be placed so as to flank and relieve one another, together with the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent spaces of our life; that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <hi>(the sin which doth so easily beset</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>us)</hi> may not come on between, or at any time assault us, without a force suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently near to reach and repell him.</p>
               <p>In determining these seasons and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of time according to just propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, honest prudence (weighing the several conditions, capacities and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of each person) must arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate. For some difference is to be made between a Merchant and a Monk; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those who follow a Court, and those who reside in a Cloister or a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. Some men having great encumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of business and duty, by necessity imposed on them, which consume much of their time, and engage their thoughts; of them in reason neither so frequent recourses to, nor so long continuance in prayer can be demanded, as from those who enjoy more abundant leisure, and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:104623:121"/>
freer scope of thoughts. But some fit times all may, and must allow, which no avocation of business, no distraction of care should purloin from them.</p>
               <p>Certain seasons and periods of this kind Nature it self (in correspondence to her unalterable revolutions) doth seem to define and prescribe: those which the Royal Prophet recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, when he faith, <hi>It is a good thing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 92. 1. 55. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy Name, O thou most High: To shew forth thy loving-kindness every morning, and thy faithfulness every night.</hi> Every Day we do recover and receive a new life from God; every Morning we do commence business, or revive it; from our bed of rest and security we then issue forth, exposing our selves to the cares and toils, to the dangers, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and temptations of the world: then especially therefore it is reasonable, that we should sacrifice thanks to the gracious Preserver of our life, and the faithfull Restorer of its supports and comforts; that we should crave his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and help in the pursuit of our honest undertakings; that to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from sin and mischief we should recommend our selves and our affairs;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:104623:122"/>
that, by offering up to him the first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits of our diurnal labours, we should consecrate and consign them all to his blessing; that as we are then wont to salute all the world, so then chiefly with humble obeisance we should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost him, who is ever present with us, and continually watchfull over us. Then also peculiarly Devotion is most seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, because then our minds being less prepossessed and pestered with other cares, our fancies becoming lively and gay, our memories fresh and prompt, our spirits copious and brisk, we are better disposed for it.</p>
               <p>Every Night also reason calleth for these Duties; requiring that we should close our business, and wind up all our cares in Devotion; that we should then bless God for his gracious preservation of us from the manifold hazzards and the sins to which we stood obnoxious; that we should implore his mercy for the manifold neglects and transgressions of our duty, which through the day past we have incurred; that our minds being then so tired with study and care, our spirits so wasted with labour and toil, that we cannot any longer sustain our selves, but do of our own accord sink
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:104623:122"/>
down into a posture of death, we should, as dying men, resign our Souls into God's hand, depositing our selves and our concernments into his custody, who alone <hi>doth never sleep nor slumber;</hi> praying that he would guard us from all the dangers and disturbances inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to us in that state of forgetfulness, and <hi>interregnum</hi> of our Reason; that he would grant us a happy resurrection in safety and health, with a good and chearfull mind, enabling us thereafter comfortably to enjoy our selves, and delightfully to serve him.</p>
               <p>Thus if we do constantly bound and circumscribe our days, dedicating those most remarkable breaks of time unto God's service, since beginning and end do comprehend the whole, seeing in the computation and style of <hi>Moses E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening and Morning</hi> do constitute a Day; we may with some good congruity be said to pray incessantly.</p>
               <p>Especially if at the middle distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those extremes we are wont to interpose somewhat of Devotion. For as then usually our spirits, being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what shattered and spent, do need a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit, enabling us to pass through the residue of the day with its incumbent
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:104623:123"/>
business: so then it would doe well, and may be requisite, in a meal of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to refresh our Souls with spiritual sustenance, drawn from the never-fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling store-house of Divine grace; which may so fortifie us, that with due vigour and alacrity we may perform the ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duties to God's honour, and our own comfort. Thus to practise was the resolution of the Psalmist, that great Master of Devotion; <hi>Evening,</hi> (said he) <note place="margin">Psal. 55. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and morning, and at noon will I pray, and cry aloud.</hi> And this was the custom of the noble <hi>Daniel,</hi> from which no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion could divert, no hazzard could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr him: <hi>He kneeled,</hi> saith the story, <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 6. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are times which it is necessary, or very expedient, that all men (even persons of highest rank, and greatest em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment) should observe. These even of old were the practices of Religious persons, not expressely prescribed by God's Law, but assumed by themselves; good reason suggesting them to the first practisers, and the consenting example of pious men afterward enforcing them.</p>
               <p>God indeed did himself in his Law, or by his Prophets, appoint publick and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:104623:123"/>
solemn celebrations of worship to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in Sacrifices (involving Prayer, and accompanied therewith) constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be offered every morning and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening; religious Princes also did insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <note place="margin">

                     <p>Ezr. 3. 3.</p>
                  </note> services of thanksgiving and praise to be performed at those times: but there doth not appear any direct insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of private Devotion, or its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances; but the practice thereof seemeth originally to have been purely voluntary, managed and measured ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the reason, by the choice of each person: yet so, that the practice of eminently-good men leading, and others following, it grew into a kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law, or standing rule, (seeming to carry an obligation with it,) to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the times specified.</p>
               <p>Besides those three times, there were farther other middle times observed by devout people, who had leisure, and disposition of mind thereto; once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween morning and noon, and once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween noon and evening were seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to that purpose: whence in the <hi>Acts</hi> the ninth hour of the day (that is, the middle intervall between noon and evening) is called <hi>the hour of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 3. 1.</note> Yea, some did impose on themselves
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:104623:124"/>
the observation of two other times, one between evening and midnight, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther between midnight and morn. To which practice those places in the <hi>Psalms</hi> do seem to allude; <hi>My mouth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 63. 5, 6.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 147, 148.</note> 
                  <hi>the dawning of the morning, and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Mine eyes prevent the night-watches, that I may meditate on thy word.</hi> And plainly the whole number of those times, which the Psalmist observed, is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in those words, <hi>Seven times a day</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ps. 119. 164.</note> 
                  <hi>will I praise thee, because of thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgments.</hi> Which examples who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shall chuse to follow, (in any measure) he shall doe wisely and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably; he shall certainly have no cause to repent; he will find it richly worth his while; great benefit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort will thence accrue unto him.</p>
               <p>If indeed <hi>Jews</hi> were so liberal in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing, so punctual in affording such portions of time for yielding praise and offering supplications unto God; how much more free and ready, more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diligent should we be in this way of practice? we, who have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion so far more spiritual, and exempt
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:104623:124"/>
from corporeal incumbrances; Precepts so more express and clear; so much higher obligations, and stronger encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to this duty; whom God in especial manner so graciously doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, so powerfully doth attract unto himself? But farther,</p>
               <p n="7">VII. More especially this Precept may be supposed to exact from us a compliance in carefully observing the times of Devotion ordained by publick <note place="margin">Levir. 19. 30. &amp; 26. 2. <hi>Ye shall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my Sanctuary.</hi>
                  </note> Authority, or settled by general Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom. This in a popular and legal sense is doing a thing indesinently, when we perform it so often as is required by law or custom. So the Apostle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> saith of the <hi>Priests,</hi> that <hi>they</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>went always into the Tabernacle, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing the service of God: always,</hi> that is, at all the solemn times appointed. And thus of the Apostles it is affirmed by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> that <hi>they were continually in the Temple, blessing and praising God;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 53.</note> that is, they constantly resorted thither at the stated times of concourse for prayer. This good Reason also plainly doth injoyn: For that the neglecting it is not onely a disorderly behaviour in a matter of high consequence; a criminal

disregard and disobedience to Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; a scandalous contempt of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, from whose laudable fashion we discost; a wrongfull deserting the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick, to whose good, mainly promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the publick worship of God, we do owe the contribution of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour: but a hainous affront to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, who thereby is plainly dishonoured, and in a manner openly disavowed; a huge prejudice to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the credit and power whereof, without visible profession, exemplary compliance, mutual consent and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, cannot be upheld. Were there times by law or custom defined, (as in some places indeed there are,) when all men should be required in person solemnly to attend on their Prince, for professing their Allegeance, or deferring any Homage to him; would not those who should wilfully refuse or decline appearance, be justly chargeable as guilty of dishonouring and wronging him? would not their such defailance pass for sufficient proof, that they do not acknowledge him, that at least they do not much regard or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue him? So by not joyning at stated times in celebration of Divine worship,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:104623:125"/>
we may be well conceived wholly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim God, or greatly to disesteem him; to slight Religion, as a thing insignificant and unprofitable. Do we not indeed thereby more then intimate, that we little believe God to be our Sovereign Lord, and Governour; that we stand in no great awe or dread of him; that we are not much sensible of his benefits and mercies; that we repose small trust or hope in him; that we do not take our selves much to want his protection, his guidance, his assistence, his favour and mercy? Are we not in effect like unto those in <hi>Job,</hi> who <hi>say unto God, Depart</hi>

What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? or what profit shall we have, if we pray unto him?</hi> Thus the standers by commonly (some so as to be much offended at, others so as to be corrupted by our bad example) will interpret this neglect: and so assuredly God himself will take it from us, and accordingly deal with us.

                  <hi>before them also.</hi> What other measure indeed can we imagine, or expect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive? Will God, think we, be so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and fond to us, so disregardfull and injurious toward himself, that he will vouchsafe to appear in favour to us, when we deign not to appear in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to him? that he will openly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our repute, when we apparently disregard his honour? that he will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his wisedom, or exert his power in our behalf, when we scarce will think a thought, or stir a step for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? Can we hope, that he will free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispense prosperous success to our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises, when we either care not, or scorn to implore his help? that he will reach forth undeserved blessings to us, when we subtract due praises from him?
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:104623:126"/>

               <p n="8">VIII. Lastly, <hi>Praying incessantly</hi> may import at large a frequency in Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This the words at least do exact, or necessarily imply, however expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For doing <hi>incessantly</hi> cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply less then doing <hi>frequently:</hi> in no tolerable sense can we be said to doe that continually, which we doe seldom; but it is an ordinary scheme of speech to say that a man doeth that always, which he is wont to doe, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth often. As of the pious souldier <hi>Cornelius</hi> it is said, that he <hi>gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 10. 2.</note> and of <hi>Anna</hi> the Prophetess, that she <hi>departed not from the Temple, but ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:104623:127"/>
with an assiduous constancy. As the words may bear, and do involve this sense, so doth the reason of the case in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it: for very just, very fit, very needfull it is to practise thus. There is ever at hand abundant reason for, and apposite matter of Devotion; therefore no large space of time should pass with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: there be perpetually depending many causes thereof; whence there is not to be allowed any long vacation from it. As every moment we from God's mercy and bounty partake great favours; so should we often render thanks and praise for them: for perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to receive courtesies, and rarely to return acknowledgments, is notorious ingratitude and iniquity. We frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (and in a manner continually) do fall into sins; often therefore we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to confess sins, we are concerned to deprecate wrath, and beg mercy: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we must long croutch under the sore burthen of guilt, the sad dread of punishment, the bitter pangs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse, or the desperate hazzard of stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid obduration. What-ever we design or undertake, toward the good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement and happy success thereof we (being ignorant and impotent creatures)
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:104623:127"/>
do need the guidance, the assistence, and the blessing of God: so often therefore it is requisite that we should be seeking and suing for them: if not, we do not onely transgress our duties, but fondly neglect, or foully betray our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments. The Causes therefore of Devotion being so constant, the Effects in some correspondence should be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
               <p>Such frequency is indeed necessary for the breeding, the nourishment, the growth and improvement of all Piety. Devotion is that holy and heavenly fire, which darteth into our minds the light of spiritual knowledge, which kindleth in our hearts the warmth of holy desires: if therefore we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long absent from it, a night of darkness will overspread our minds, a deadning coldness will seise upon our affections. It is the best food of our Souls, which preserveth their life and health, which repaireth their strength and vigour, which rendreth them lusty and active: if we therefore long abstain from it, we shall starve, or pine away; we shall be faint and feeble in all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious performances; we shall have none at all, or a very languid and meager Piety.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:104623:128"/>
To maintain in us a constant and steddy disposition to obedience, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our perverse inclinations, to curb our unruly passions, to strengthen us against temptations, to comfort us in anxieties and distresses, we do need continual supplies of grace from God; the which ordinarily are communicated in Devotion, as the chanel which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyeth, or the instrument which hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth to procure it, or the condition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it is granted. Faith, Hope, Love, spiritual Comfort and Joy, all Divine Graces are chiefly elicited, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, exercised therein and thereby: it is therefore needfull that it should frequently be used; seeing otherwise we shall be in danger to fail in dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our chief Duties, and to want the best Graces.</p>
               <p>It is frequency of Devotion also which maintaineth that Friendship with God, which is the soul of Piety. As familiar conversation (wherein men do express their minds and affections mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually) breedeth acquaintance, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth good will of men to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but long forbearence thereof dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveth, or slackneth the bonds of ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, breaking their intimacy, and cooling
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:104623:128"/>
their kindness: so is it in respect to God; it is frequent converse with him which begetteth a particular acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him, a mindfull regard of him, a hearty liking to him, a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tast of his goodness, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a sincere and solid good will toward him: but intermission thereof produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth estrangement, or enmity toward him. If we seldom come at God, we shall little know him, not much care for him, scarce remember him, rest insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of his love, and regardless of his favour; a coldness, a shyness, a distast, an antipathy toward him will by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees creep upon us. Abstinence from his company and presence will cast us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conversations destructive, or prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to our friendship with him; wherein soon we shall contract familiarity and friendship with his enemies, (the World and the Flesh,) which are inconsistent with love to him, which will dispose us to forget him, or to dislike and loath him.</p>
               <p>It is, in fine, the frequency of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion which alone can secure any practice thereof, at least any practice thereof duly qualified; so hearty, so easy, so sweet and delightfull as it should be. We have all a naturall
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:104623:129"/>
averseness or indisposition thereto, as requiring an abstraction of thoughts and affections from sensible things, and a fastning them upon objects purely spiritual; a rearing our heavy spirits above their common pitch; a staying and settling our roving fancies; a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing our vain hearts in a sober and steddy frame, agreeable to Devotion: to effect which things is a matter of no small difficulty and pain; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without much use and exercise can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accomplished; but with it, may; so that by frequent practice the bent of our heart being turned, the strangeness of the thing ceasing, the difficulty of the work being surmounted, we shall obtain a good propension to the duty, and a great satisfaction therein.</p>
               <p>This will render the way into God's presence smooth and passable; remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as all other obstacles, so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly those of fear and doubt in respect to God, which may deterr or discourage us from approaching to him. God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most holy and pure, most great and glorious, we, sensible of our corruption and vileness, may be fearfull and shy of coming near unto him. But when, coming into his presence, we do find,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:104623:129"/>
that <hi>such as his Majesty is, such is his Mercy;</hi> when we do <hi>tast and see that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 34. 8.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Psal. 84. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>soul longeth, yea even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.</hi> This will engage us into strong resolutions of constantly practising it; such as the same Holy person again declareth in those words, <hi>I love the Lord, because he</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 116. 1. 138. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>hath heard my voice and my supplications: Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.</hi> Hence, in stead of a suspicious estrangedness, a servile dread, or an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:104623:130"/>
disaffection toward God, there will spring up an humble confidence, a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reverence, a hearty love toward him; which will upon all occasions drive us to him, hoping for his friendly succour, longing after his kind embraces. So will the frequency of Devotion render it facil and pleasant. Whereas, on the contrary, disuse thereof will make it at any time hard and irksome; strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and encreasing our natural averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness thereto: performing it seldom, we shall never perform it well; with that attention, that affection, that prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that willingness and alacrity, which are due thereto.</p>
               <p>According to so many senses, in so many respects, may we, and should we observe this Precept. From thus pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually there can be no good exception, or just excuse. The most common pleas that will be alledged for the omission thereof are two; one drawn from external avocations, the other from internal indispositions, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing it: both of which are so far from being good, that, being scanned, they will soon appear serving rather to aggravate, then to excuse, or abate the neglect.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Do we take Devotion it self to be no business, or a business of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration? Do we conceit, when we pay God his debts, or discharge our duties toward him, when we crave his aid or mercy, when we solicit the main concernments of our Soul, (yea, of our body also, and its estate,) that we are idle, or misemployed? that we lavish our time, or lose our pains?</p>
               <p n="2">2. What other affairs can we have of greater moment or necessity then this? Can there be any obligation more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable, then is that of yielding due respect and service to our Maker, our great Patron, our most liberal Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour? Can there be any interest more close or weighty then this, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for our Souls eternal health and happiness?

               <p n="4">4. Should we not farther, honestly comparing things, easily discern, that it is no such indispensable business, but rather indeed some base dotage on lucre, some inveigling bait of pleasure, some be witching transport of fancy, that cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

Yea, is it not commonly sloth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then activity, an averseness from this rather then an inclination to any other employment, which diverteth us from our Prayers? Is not, I say, the true reason why we pray so seldom, not because we are very busie, but because we are extreamly idle; so idle, that we cannot willingly take the pains to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>screw our affections from sensible things, to reduce our wandring thoughts, to compose our hearts into a right frame, to bend our untoward inclinations to a compliance with our duty? Is it not because we do not feel that favour and satisfaction in these, which we do in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trivial and worthless employments, nor will be at the trouble to work such dispositions in our Souls? Do we not betake our selves to other conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and commerces meerly for refuge, shunning this intercourse with God, and with our selves?

Is it not evidently better, that the pursuit of our temporal interests, what-ever they be, should be a little checked, then that our affairs of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting consequence should be quite laid aside? that we should venture a small impairing of our estate, then sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endammage our Souls? that we hazzard to disappoint or displease a man, then dare to affront and offend the Almighty God?</p>

It is the most sure, most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, most advantageous and compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way of transacting affairs, to mix Prayers and Praises with them: it is the best oil that can be, to make the wheels of action go on smoothly and speedily: it not onely sanctifieth our undertakings, but much promoteth and exceedingly sweetneth the management of them. For the conscience of having rendred unto God his due respect and service, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intrusted our affairs to his care, of having consequently engaged his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:104623:134"/>
and assistence for us, will dispose us to doe things with a courageous ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity and comfortable satisfaction; will fill us with a good hope of prospering; will prepare us however to be satisfied with the event, what-ever it shall be; will in effect procure a blessing and happy success, such as we may truly rejoyce and triumph in, as conferred by God in favour to us. Whereas neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting these duties, we can have no solid content or savoury complacence in any thing we undertake: reflecting on such misbehaviour (if we be not downright infidels, or obdurate reprobates in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety) will quash or damp our courage: having thence forfeited all pretence to God's succour, and provoked him to cross us, we must needs suspect disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: as we have no reasonable ground to hope for success; so we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, if success arriveth, be heartily sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied therein, or take it for a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
               <p>He therefore that is such a niggard of his time, that he grudgeth to withhold any part thereof from his worldly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, deeming all time cast away that is laid out in waiting upon God, is really most unthristy and prodigal
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:104623:135"/>
thereof: by sparing a little, he wasteth all his time to no purpose; by so eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pursuing, he effectually setteth back his designs; by preposterously affecting to dispatch his affairs, he rendreth them endless, or, which is the same, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unprofitable.</p>
               <p>In fine, we may be sure that no time is spent even so prudently and politick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with so great advantage, and so real fruit to our selves, as that which is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed upon Devotion. In sacrificing his time, his pains, his substance, any thing he hath or can doe, to God's ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, no man can be a loser.</p>

then a single omission: it ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be corrected and cured; and the way to doe it is, by setting present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the practice of the Duty, and persisting resolutely therein: otherwise how is it possible that it should ever be removed? The longer we forbear it, the more seldom we perform it, the stronger surely will our indisposition grow, and the more difficult it will be to remove it. But if (with any degree of seriousness and good intention) we come indisposed to Prayer, we may thereby be formed into better dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and by continual attendence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we shall (God's grace co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which never is wanting to serious and honest intentions) grow toward a perfect fitness for it: Prayer by degrees will become natural and delightfull to us.</p>

them, that they neither decay with age, nor prematurely die, nor be buried in oblivion; but may resemble the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and poetical descriptions of the Graces, those goodly Daughters of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, smiling always with a never-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding serenity of countenance, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing in an immortal youth.</p>

In like manner should we in the heart and centre of our Soul, in the best and highest appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, in the places most expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to ordinary observation, and most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from the invasions of worldly care, erect lively representations of, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting memorials unto the Divine boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; constantly attending to which we may be disposed to Gratitude. Not one blessing, not the least favourable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Providence ought to perish with us, though long since past, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the sphere of present sense.</p>
               <p>We must not in our Old age forget who formed us in the Womb, who <note place="margin">Psal. 71. 6.</note>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:104623:141"/>
brought us into the light, who suckled our Infancy, who educated our Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, who governed our Youth, who conducted our Manhood through the manifold hazzards, troubles and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of life. Nor in our Prosperity, our affluence of good things, our possession of <hi>Canaan,</hi> should we be unmindfull of <note place="margin">Deut. 6. 12. 8. 11.</note> him who relieved us in our streights, who supplied our wants, sustained our adversity, who redeemed us from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and led us through the wilderness. A succession of new and fresh Benefits should not (as among some Savages the manner is for the young to make away the old) supplant and expunge ancient ones, but make them rather more dear and venerable to us. Time should not weaken or diminish, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and radicate in us the remembrance of God's goodness; to render it, as it doth gold and wine, more precious, and more strong. We have usually a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry more then enough tenacious of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and ill turns done us: let it never be said, to the disgrace of that noble fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, that we can hardly forget the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courtesies of man, but not easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the favours of God.

3. This Duty implies a due Esteem and valuation of Benefits; that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and quality, the measure and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, the circumstances and consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of them be well expended: else the Gratitude is like to be none, or very defective. For we commensurate our thankfulness, not so much to the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick excellency of things, as to our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar estimations of them. A <hi>Cynick,</hi> perhaps, would not return more thanks for a diamond, then for a pebble; nor more gratefully receive a talent of gold, then an ounce of copper: because he equally values, or rather alike contemns both.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we find our (never-to-be-forgotten) example, the devout Thanksgiver <hi>David,</hi> continually decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the great price he set upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favours; admiring and displaying their transcendent perfections, their wonderfull greatness, their boundless extension, their excessive multitude, their endless duration, their advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous circumstances, (the excellent need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, convenience, and seasonableness of them; together with the admirable freeness, wisedom and power of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactour shining forth in and by them.)

               </p>
               <p>In such manner ought we diligently to survey, and judiciously to estimate the effects of Divine beneficence, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining every part, and descanting upon every circumstance thereof: like those
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:104623:143"/>
that contemplate some rare beauty, or some excellent picture; some commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the exact proportions, some the gracefull features, some the lively co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours discernible therein. There is not the least of the Divine favours, which, if we consider the condescensive ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, the clear intention, the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served frankness, the chearfull debonai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity expressed therein, hath not dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions larger then our comprehension, colours too fair, and lineaments too comely for our weak sight thoroughly to discern; requiring therefore our highest esteem, and our utmost thanks.</p>
               <p>'Tis, perhaps, somewhat dangerous to affix a determinate value upon any of God's Benefits: (for to value them seems to undervalue them, they being really inestimable:) what then is it to extenuate, to vilifie, to despise the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test? We should esteem them, as we measure the Heavens with our eye, as we compute the sands upon the shore, as we would prize inexhaustible mines of gold, and treasures of pearl; that is, by confessing heartily their worth sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes the strength of our imagination to conceive, and of our speech to utter; that they are immense, innumerable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:104623:143"/>
 and unexpressible. But still,</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Giving thanks</hi> imports, that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits be received with a willing mind, a hearty sense, a vehement affection. The forementioned particulars are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed necessary properties, inseparable concomitants, or prerequisite conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to; but a chearfull and cordial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of Benefits is the form (as it were) and soul, the life and spirit, the principal and most essential ingredient of this Duty.</p>
               <p>It was not altogether unreasonable, though it went for a Paradox, that dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> That <hi>animus sufficit animo,</hi> and, That <hi>qui libenter accepit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficium reddidit:</hi> that he, who with a willing and well-affected mind receives a courtesie, hath fully discharged the duty of Gratitude; that other endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of return and compensation are rather handsome accessions to it, then indispensably requisite to the completi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof. For as in the Collation, 'tis not the gold or the silver, the food or the apparel, in which the Benefit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists, but the will and benevolent inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him that bestows them: so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally 'tis the good acceptance, the

               <p>And the farther to provoke us, we may consider, that it hath been the manner, prompted by Nature, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by general practice, for men of all nations, and all times, and all ways, by composed Hymns and pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrical Elogies, to express their grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for the gifts of Nature, and for the Benefits indulged by Providence; in

their publick Sacrifices and solemn Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivities extolling the excellent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their imaginary Deities; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing the famous atchievements of their Heroes, and supposed Benefactours: to whose favourable help and blessing, in their conceit, they owed the fruits of the earth, the comforts of life, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and patronage of their countries: being indeed mistaken in the object, but not transgressing in the substance of the Duty; paying a due debt, though to false creditours. And I wish we were as ready to imitate them in the one, as we are, perhaps, prone to blame them for the other. For, certainly, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of the Divine Goodness, and solemn testifications of our thankfull sense thereof, (what-ever the abused world may now imagine,) was always, is now, and ever will be the principal and most noble part of all Religion immediately addressed to God.

               <p n="7">7. That true Gratitude for Benefits is always attended with the Esteem, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and love of the Benefactour. Beneficence is a Royal and God-like thing, an argument of eminent Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Power conspiring; and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily therefore, as in them that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and duly consider it, it begets Respect and Reverence, so peculiarly in those that feel its benign influence, it produces Love and Affection: like the heavenly Light, which to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it appears glorious; but more powerfully warms those that are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly subject to its rays, and is by them more vigorously reflected.</p>
               <p>And as to those that are immediately concerned therein, it imports more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Regard and Good will; so, if they be duly sensible thereof, it engages them, in mutual correspondence, to an extraordinary esteem and Benevolence: such as <hi>David</hi> upon this account pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses to have been in himself toward

is necessary for our sustenance, convenient for our use, pleasant for our enjoyment; not onely those that come immediately from his hand, but what we obtain from others, who from him receive both the will and the power, the means and the opportunities of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us good: to whom we owe, not onely what we ever did, or do at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent possess, or can hereafter hope for of good; but that we were, are, or shall ever be in capacity to receive any: to the authour, upholder and preserver of our being; without whose good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness we had never been, and without whose care we cannot subsist one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

To which blessed End by all sutable means (of eternal ministry and interiour assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) he faithfully conducts us; revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to us the way, urging us in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, reclaiming us when we deviate; engaging us by his Commands, soliciting us by gentle Advices, encouraging us by gracious Promises; instructing us by his holy Word, and admonishing us by his loving Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To Him,</hi> who vouchfafes to grant us a free access unto, a constant intercourse
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:104623:153"/>
and a familiar acquaintance with Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; to esteem and style us his <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Children;</hi> to invite us frequently, and entertain us kindly with those most pleasant delicacies of spiritual repast; yea, to visit us often at our home, and (if we admit) to abide and dwell with us; indulging us the enjoyment of that Presence, wherein the life of all joy and comfort consists, and to behold the light of his all-chearing countenance.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing more? Yes: <hi>To Him</hi> who, to redeem us from Misery, and to advance our estate, hath infinitely debased Himself, and eclipsed the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his glorious Majesty; not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining to assume us into a near affinity, yea, into a perfect union with himself; to inhabit our frail and mortal nature, to undergo the laws and conditions of Humanity, to appear in our shape, and converse, as it were, upon equal terms with us, and at last to tast the bitter Cup of a most painful and disgraceful Death for us.</p>
               <p>Yea, <hi>To Him,</hi> who not only descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from his Imperial Throne, became a Subject, and (which is more) a Servant for our sake; but designed thereby to exalt us to a participation of his royal
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:104623:154"/>
dignity, his Divine nature, his eternal glory and bliss; submitting Crowns and Sceptres to our choice; Crowns that cannot fade, and Sceptres that can never be extorted from us.</p>
               <p>Farther yet, <hi>To Him,</hi> the excellent quality, the noble end, the most obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging manner of whose Beneficence doth surpass the matter thereof, and hugely augment the Benefits: who, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by any necessity, not obliged by any law, (or previous compact,) not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by any extrinsick arguments, not inclined by our merits, not wearied with our importunities, not instigated by troublesome passions of pity, shame, or fear, (as we are wont to be,) not flattered with promises of recompence, nor bribed with expectation of emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thence to accrue unto himself; but being absolute Master of his own actions, only both Law-giver and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor to himself, al-sufficient, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of admitting any accession to his perfect blissfulness; most willingly and freely, out of pure bounty and good will, is our friend and benefactour; preventing not only our desires, but our knowledge; surpassing not our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts only, but our wishes, yea, even
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:104623:154"/>
our conceits, in the dispensation of his inestimable and unrequitable benefits; having no other drift in the collation of them, beside our real good and welfare, our profit and advantage, our pleasure and content.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To Him,</hi> who not lately began, or sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly will cease, that is either uncertain or mutable in his intentions, but from everlasting designed, continues daily, and will (if we suffer him) to all eternity persevere unmovable in his resolutions to do us good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To Him,</hi> whom no ingratitude, no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutiful carriage, no rebellious disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of ours could for one minute wholly remove, or divert from his sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy purpose of caring for us: who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards us, though we do not attend to him; procures our welfare, though we neglect his concernments; employs his restless thought, extends his watchful eye, exerts his powerful arm, is always mindful, and always busy to do us good; watching over us, when we sleep, and remembring us, when we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get our selves: in whom yet 'tis insinite condescension to think of us, who are placed so far beneath his thoughts; to value us, who are but dust, and dirt;
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:104623:155"/>
not to despise and hate us, who are real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so despicable and unworthy. For, <hi>though he dwelleth on high,</hi> (saith the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist truly and emphatically,) <hi>he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To Him</hi> that is as merciful and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as liberal and munificent toward us: that not only bestows on us more gifts, but pardons us more debts, and forgives us more sins, then we live minutes: that with infinite patience endures, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our manifold infirmities and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but our petulant follies, our obstinate perversnesses, our treacherous insidelities; overlooks our careless neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, and our wilful miscarriages; puts up the exceeding-many outragious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, injuries and contumelies conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually offered to his Supreme Majesty, by us base worms, whom he hath always under his feet, and can crush to nothing at his pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To Him</hi> yet, who (as St. <hi>James</hi> saith) <hi>giveth freely, and upbraideth no man:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 5.</note> who calls us neither very frequently, nor over-strictly to accounts: who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts of us no impossible, no very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, no greatly-burdensome, or cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returns; being satisfied with the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:104623:155"/>
chearful acceptance of his favours, the hearty acknowledgments of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the sincere performance of such duties to which our own welfare, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and advantage (rightly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) would otherwise abundantly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To Him,</hi> lastly, whose Benefits to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, is the greatest Benefit of all; to be enabled to thank whom, deserves our greatest thanks; to be sensible of whose Beneficence, to meditate on whose Goodness, to admire whose Excellency, to celebrate whose Praise, is Heaven it self and Paradise, the life of Angels, the quintessence of Joy, the supreme degree of Felicity.</p>
               <p>In a word, <hi>To Him,</hi> whose Benefits are immensely great, innumerably many, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressibly good and precious. For, <hi>Who</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 106.</note> 
                  <hi>can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? who can shew forth his praise?</hi> said he, who had imployed often his most active thoughts, and his utmost endeavours thereupon, and was incomparably better able to do it.</p>
               <p>To this God, to this great, to this only Benefactour of ours, we owe this most natural and easie, this most just and equal, this most sweet and pleasant Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:104623:156"/>
of giving Thanks. To whom if we wilfully refuse, if we carelesly neglect to pay it, I shall only say thus much, That we are not onely monstrously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, and horribly wicked; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominably foolish, and deplorably mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable. I shall repeat this sentence once again, and wish it may have its due ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon us: To this great, to this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Patron and Benefactour of ours, if we do not in some measure discharge our due debt of Gratitude, for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable Benefits and Mercies, we are to be adjudged not onely most prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously unthankful, most detestably impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but most wofully stupid also and senseless, most desperately wretched and unhappy.</p>
               <p>I should now proceed to consider the Circumstance of Time, determined in the word <hi>Always;</hi> and the extension of the Matter implied in those words, <hi>for all things:</hi> and then to subjoyn some far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inducements, or arguments persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive to the practice of this Duty. But the time (and, I fear, your patience) failing, I shall reserve them to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opportunity.</p>

               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>EPHES. 5. 20.</bibl>
                  <q>Giving thanks always for all things unto God.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>HAving formerly discoursed upon these words, I observed in them Four Particulars considerable; 1. the substance of a Duty, to which we are exhorted, to <hi>give thanks;</hi> 2. the Term unto which it is directed, <hi>to God;</hi> 3. the Circumstance of time, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that word, <hi>always;</hi> 4. the Extent of the Matter about which the Duty is employed, <hi>for all things.</hi> Concerning the Two former Particulars, wherein the Duty consisted, and wherefore espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially related unto God, I then repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented what did occur to my medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="3">III. I proceed now to the Third, the Circumstance of Time allotted to the performance of this Duty, expressed by
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:104623:157"/>
that universal and unlimited term, <hi>Always.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which yet is not so to be understood, as if thereby we were obliged in every instant (or singular point of time) actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to remember, to consider, to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with, and to acknowledge the Divine Benefits: for the deliberate ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of our minds being sometimes wholly interrupted by sleep, otherwhile pre-occupied by the indispensible care of serving our natural necessities, (and with attendence upon other reasonable imployments,) it were impossible to comply with an obligation to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this Duty so interpreted. And those Maxims of Law, <hi>Impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um nulla est obligatio;</hi> and, <hi>Quae rerum naturâ prohibentur, nullâ Lege confirmata sunt,</hi> (that is, <hi>No Law or Precept can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige to Impossibilities,)</hi> being evidently grounded upon natural equity, seem yet more valid in relation to his Laws, who is the Judge of all the World, and in his dispensations most transcendently just and equal.</p>
               <p>We may therefore observe that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> are wont (in way of <hi>Synecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,</hi> or grammatical <hi>Hyperbole)</hi> so to use words of this kind, that their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal importance ought to be restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:104623:157"/>
by the quality or circumstances of the matter about which they converse. As when our Saviour saith, <hi>Ye shall be hated by all men for my sake; All</hi> is not <note place="margin">Matt. 10. 22.</note> to be taken for every singular person, (since there were some that loved our Saviour, and embraced the Evangelical Doctrine,) but for many, or the most. And when <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>There is none that doeth good;</hi> he seemeth only to mean, <note place="margin">Psal. 14. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> that in the general corruption of his times, there were few righteous persons to be found. And so <hi>for ever</hi> is often used, not for a perpetual and endless, but for a long and lasting duration; and <hi>always,</hi> not for a continual (unintermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) state of being, or action, but for such a perseverance as agrees to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the thing to which it is applied.</p>
               <p>'Tis (for instance) prescribed in <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> that <hi>Aaron</hi> should <hi>bear the judgment of the Children of Israel</hi> (the <hi>Urim</hi> and <note place="margin">Exod. 28. 30</note> 
                  <hi>Thummim) upon his heart before the Lord continually;</hi> that is (not in absolute and rigorous acception continually, but) constantly, ever when he went into the Holy Place to discharge the Pontifical function, as the context declares. And our Saviour in the Gospel saith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>in the Temple;</hi> that is, very often, and ever when fit occasion was presented. And the Apostles, immediately after <hi>Christ</hi>'s ascension, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>were</hi> (as St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us) <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>

                  <hi>in the Temple, praising and blessing God;</hi> that is, they resorted thither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly at the usual times, or canonical hours of prayer; in like manner those injunctions (of nearest affinity) of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 16, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>of giving thanks always,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of <hi>praying without ceasing,</hi> (as I have shewn more largly in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">

                  </note> Discourse,) are to be taken in a sense so qualified, that the observance of them may be at least morally pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
               <p>Thus far warrantably we may limit the extension, and mollifie the rigour of this seemingly-boundless term: but we can hardly allow any farther restric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without destroying the natural sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, or diminishing the due empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis thereof. As far therefore as 'tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for us, we must endeavour always to perform this duty of Gratitude to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God: and consequently,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hereby is required a Frequent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof; that we do often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually meditate upon, be sensible of,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:104623:158"/>
confess and celebrate the Divine Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence. For what is done but seldom or never, (as we commonly say) cannot be understood done always, without a <hi>Catachresis,</hi> or abuse of words too enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. As therefore no moment of our life wants sufficient matter, and every considerable portion of time ministers notable occasion of blessing God; as he allows himself no spacious inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls, or discontinuances of doing us good: so ought we not to suffer any of those many days (vouchsafed by his goodness) to flow beside us, void of the signall expressions of our dutifull Thankfulness to him; nor to admit in our course of life any long vacations from this Duty. If God incessantly, and through every minute, demonstrates himself gracious unto us; we in all reason are obliged frequently and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to declare our selves gratefull unto him.</p>
               <p>So at least did <hi>David,</hi> (that most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent example in this kind, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore most apposite to illustrate our Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and to enforce the practice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;) for, <hi>Every day,</hi> saith he, <hi>I will</hi>

bodies did not more constantly observe their course, then he his diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal revolutions of praise: Every day in his Kalendar was as it were Festival, and consecrated to Thansgiving. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he adjudge it sufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote some small parcels of each day to this Service: for, <hi>My Tongue</hi> (saith he) <note place="margin">Psal. 35. 28</note>

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:104623:159"/>
were incumbent: yet could not they thrust out of his memory, nor extinguish in his heart the lively sense of Divine goodness; which (notwithstanding the company of other secular encumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) was always present to his mind, and, like a spirit, excluded from no place by any corporeal resistence,) did mingle with and penetrate all his thoughts, and affections, and actions. So that he seems to have approached very near to the compleat performance of this Duty, according to the extremity of a literal interpretation; and to have been always without any intermission em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in giving thanks to God.

us so many hours from the manifold dangers, and more sins, to which by our weakness, and our folly, and our bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, we are through every minute exposed; and withal hath provided us so easie, and so delightful a means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering our spent activity, of repairing our decayed strength.</p>

               <p>As our beings and powers did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Goodness, so the results of them naturally tend to the Glory of God; and the deliberations of our Will ought to conspire with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincts

of our Nature: it should be the principal design which our Intention should aim at, and our Endeavour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways drive on, to glorifie our Maker.

This term <hi>[always]</hi> doth necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily imply a Ready disposition, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual inclination to give Thanks, ever permanent in us: that our <hi>Hearts,</hi> as <hi>David's</hi> was, be <hi>fixed</hi> always (that is, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly <note place="margin">Psal. 108. 1.</note> prepared, and steadily resolved) to thank and <hi>praise</hi> God: that our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections be like tinder, though notal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways inflamed, yet easily inflamable by the sense of his Goodness.</p>
               <p>'Tis said of the righteous man, that <hi>he is ever merciful, and lendeth:</hi> not for <note place="margin">Psal. 37. 25.</note> that he doth ever actually dispense alms, or furnish his poor neighbour with sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies; but because his mind is ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to do it, when need requires. So a grateful man doth <hi>always give thanks,</hi> by being disposed to do it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all fit occasions. 'Tis the habit that qualifies and denominates a man such or such in any kind or degree of mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. A good man is in Scripture fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

compared to a <hi>Tree bringing forth fruit in due season;</hi> and the root thereof is this habitual disposition, which being nourished by the dew of Heaven, and quickned by the benign influence of Divine Grace, sprouts forth oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely, and yields a plentiful increase of good fruit. Though we cannot always sing, our organs may be always rightly tuned for praise; at least they should never be unstrung, (and wholly out of kelter.)</p>
               <p>We should maintain in our selves a constant good temper of mind, that no opportunity surprise, and find us unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to entertain worthily the effects of Divine favour: otherwise we shall as well lose the benefit, as God the thanks and glory due to them.

               <p n="5">5. Lastly, <hi>Giving thanks always</hi> imports, that we readily embrace every oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of actually expressing our Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.

for which we are bound to thank God; <q>Because (I recite his words punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually rendred) Because (saith he) he hath made us, who before had no being, and made us such as we are; because he upholds us being made, and takes care of us continually, both publickly and privately, secretly and openly, with and without our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for all visible things created for our sake, the ministery of them afforded to us; the conformation of our Bodies, the Nobleness of our Souls; his daily Dispensations by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, by Laws, by Punishments; his various and incomprehensible Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for the chief of all, that he hath not spared his onely-begotten Son for our sake; the Benefits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on us by Baptism, and the other holy Mysteries, (or Sacraments;) the ineffable good things to be bestowed on us hereafter, the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Resurrection, the enjoyment of perfect Bliss;</q> having, I say, in these words comprised the things for which we are obliged to thank and praise God, he thus despondently concludes: (<gap reason="foreign">

<q>
                     <pb n="320" facs="tcp:104623:168"/>
If any one shall endeavour to recount parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly every one of these things, he will but plunge himself into an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible depth of Benefits, and then perceive for how unexpressibly and inconceivably many good things he stands engaged to God.</q> And to the like <hi>Non-plus</hi> doth the devout Psalmist seem to be reduced, when he thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims; <hi>How precious are thy thoughts unto me, O God? how great is the sum of them?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <p>Psal. 139. 17, 18.</p>

                  <hi>If I should count them, they are more in number then the sand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall not therefore confound my self, by launching too far into this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense Ocean; nor strive minutely to compute the incomprehensible summe of the Divine Benefits: but onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that in gross, according to our Apostle's calculation, all things, which how-ever happen to us, are ingredients thereof. No occurrence (great or small, common or particular, present or past, pleasant or sad, perpetual or transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) is excluded from being the subject of our Thanksgiving: each one may prove beneficial to us; and we are with a chearful contentedness, and a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full refentment, to receive them all from
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:104623:168"/>
God's hand. But to observe some little distinction: I say,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are to give thanks, not only for great and notable Benefits, but for the least and most ordinary Favours of God: though indeed none of God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are in themselves small and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable. Men are wont to bless them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, if they receive but a transient glance from a Prince's eye; a smile from a great personage; any slender in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of regard from him that is in capacity to do them good: what is it then to receive the least testimony of his good will, from whom alone every good thing can be expected; upon whose disposal all happy success of our wishes, our hopes, and our endeavours do entirely depend? We repute him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, who withholds the least part of what is due from the true owner: and is not he ingrateful then, that omits to render thanks for the least of Divine Mercies?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is one glory of the Sun, another</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>of the Moon, another of the Stars,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Some works of God indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in lustre; yet all are glorious, all are to be discerned, all to be esteemed, and thankfully entertained by us. The
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:104623:169"/>
brightness of the one should not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obscure the other; if it do, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues the weakness of our sense, the dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our spiritual faculty. For every beam of light that delights our eye, for every breath of Air that chears our spirits, for every drop of pleasant Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour that cools our thirst, for every minute of comfortable repose, for every step we safely take, for the happy issue of the least undertaking, for escaping the vengeance due to an idle word, or a wanton thought, we owe a hymn of praise to God. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are to render thanks, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for new and present Benefits, but for all we have formerly, all that we may hereafter receive. We find <hi>David</hi> not only frequently acknowledging the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious dispensations of Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him through the whole course of his life, but looking back in his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Devotions as far as his very original being, and praising God for favours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him beyond his memory, yea before his life. <hi>I will praise thee,</hi> saith <note place="margin">Psal. 139. 14, 15, 16.</note> he, <hi>for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well. My sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance was not hid from thee, when I was</hi>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:104623:169"/>
                  <hi>made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lower parts of the Earth. Thine eyes did see my substance yet being imperfect, and in thy book all my members wère writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul,</hi> yet farther reflecting his grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful consideration, blesses God for his favour commenced before the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of things. <hi>Blessed</hi> (saith he) <hi>be the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings in heavenly places in Christ, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he hath chosen us before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither doth the memory only of former, and the enjoyment of present, but the hope and foresight also of future Blessings worthily claim our thanks. For, (saith S. <hi>Peter) Blessed be the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which, according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead: to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, reserved in Heaven for you.</hi> Beasts only, and men not much better then they, are affected with present good turns: but men of honest and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous tempers resent indifferently the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:104623:170"/>
obligations of all times. Sense doth not confine their Gratitude, nor absence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, nor age wear it out. What once is done, is ever done to them; and what of courtesie is purposed, seems to them performed. But having before discoursed somewhat largely concerning the remembrance of Benefits, I leave this point. Furthermore,</p>
               <p n="3">3. We should bless God, not only for new, rare, extraordinary accidents of Providence, but for the common and daily benefits and indulgences thereof. These Favours are usually the greatest, and most valuable in their own nature. (For what can be imagined of higher consequence to us, <note place="margin">

Shall the commonness and continuance of these exceeding Favours, that they
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:104623:170"/>
are not given us once only, and transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily, but continued, (that is, given us so often as time hath instants,) and with an uninterrupted perseverance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed unto us; shall this abate and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervate our Gratitude, which in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son should mainly encrease and confirm it? But this point I also touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and therefore forbearing to insist thereon, I proceed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We should give thanks, not only for private and particular, but for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Benefits also, and for such as befal others. <hi>I exhort therefore</hi> (saith S. <hi>Paul)</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 1.</note>

We are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a Church, and highly interested in the prosperous estate and well-being thereof: when Unity therefore is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and Charity abounds: when Knowledg is encreased, and Vertue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; when Piety flourishes, and Truth triumphs therein; we are bound to render all possible thanks to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Bestower of those inestimable Blessings.</p>
               <p>We are much mistaken in our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, if we either determine our own concernments, or measure this Duty, by the narrow rule of our private advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: for, subducting either the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits commonly indulged to mankind, or those which accrue from the welfare of publick society, what possibility will remain of subsistence, of safety, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent unto us? what but confusion, want, violence, and disquiet?</p>

               <p>If we consult all History, (Sacred, and Civil,) we shall find it to contain hardly any thing else considerable, but the earnest endeavours of good men for publick benefit, and their thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to the Divine goodness for it. <hi>Moses, David, Nehemiah, S.

               <p>Neither only as we are combined with others in common interest, but without selfish respects, purely out of charity, and humanity, and ingenuous pity, are we obliged to thank God for the Benefits he is pleased to impart to others.

                  <hi>those that hate us,</hi> and <hi>bless those that curse us;</hi> 'tis (by fair consequence) surely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:104623:172"/>
that we should also bless God for the good issue of our honest endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, or of our good wishes for them.</p>
               <p>And verily could we become endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this excellent quality of deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in others good, and heartily thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God for it, we needed not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy the wealth and splendour of the greatest Princes, not the wisdom of the profoundest Doctours, not the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the devoutest Anchorets, no, nor the happiness of the highest Angels: for upon this supposition, as the glory of all is God's, so the content in all would be ours. All the fruit they can perceive of their happy condition (of what kind soever) is, to rejoyce in it themselves, and to praise God for it: and this should we then do as well as they. My Neighbour's good Success is mine, if I equally triumph therein: his Riches are mine, if I delight to see him enjoy them: his Health is mine, if it refresh my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: his Vertue mine, if I by it am bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, and have hearty complacence therein. By this means a man derives a confluence of all joy upon himself, and makes himself, as it were, the centre of all Felicity; enriches himself with the plenty, and satiates himself with the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:104623:172"/>
pleasure of the whole world: reserving to God the praise, he enjoys the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all good that happens to any.</p>
               <p>Thus we see <hi>David</hi> frequently thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, not for his Favour only and mercy shewed peculiarly to himself, but for his common munificence toward all; for (to use his own phrases) <hi>his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>

What-ever proceeds from good purpose, and tends to a happy end, that is graciously designed, and effectually conduces to our good; is a fit subject of Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: and such may all Adversities prove unto us. They proceed usually from love and kind intention toward us:
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:104623:173"/>
for, <hi>Whom God loveth, he chasteneth, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>scourgeth every son whom he receiveth:</hi> and, <hi>I know, O Lord,</hi> (saith <hi>David)</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 75.</note> 
                  <hi>that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me: in faithfulness,</hi> that is, with a sincere inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of doing me good.</p>
               <p>God throughly knows our constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what is noxious to our health, and what may remedy our distempers; and therefore accordingly disposeth to us<hi>—pro jucundis aptissima quaeque—;</hi> in stead of pleasant Hony, he sometimes prescribes wholsome wormwood for us. We are our selves greatly ignorant of what is conducible to our real good; and, were the choice of our condition wholly permitted to us, should make very foolish, very disadvantageous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections.</p>
               <p>We should (be sure) all of us em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a rich and plentiful Estate: when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, God knows, that would make us slothful and luxurious, swell us with pride and haughty thoughts, encumber us with anxious cares, and expose us to dangerous temptations; would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us forgetful of our selves, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectful of him. Therefore he wisely disposeth Poverty unto us; Poverty,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:104623:174"/>
the mother of Sobriety, the nurse of Industry, the mistress of Wisdom; which will make us understand our selves, and our dependence on him, and force us to have recourse unto his help. And is there not reason we should be thankful for the means by which we are delivered from those desperate mischiefs, and obtain these excellent advantages?</p>
               <p>We should all (certainly) chuse the favour and applause of men: but this, God also knows, would corrupt our minds with vain conceit, would intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate our fancies with spurious pleasure, would tempt us to ascribe immoderately to our selves, and sacrilegiously to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive God of his due honour. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he advisedly suffers us to incur the Disgrace and Displeasure, the Hatred and Contempt of men; that so we may place our glory only in the hopes of his Favour, and may pursue more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly the purer delights of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. And doth not this part of Divine Providence highly merit our thanks?</p>
               <p>We would all climb into high Places, not considering the precipices on which they stand, nor the vertiginousness of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:104623:174"/>
our own brains: but God keeps us safe in the humble Valleys, allotting to us employments which we are more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to manage.</p>
               <p>We should perhaps insolently abuse Power, were it committed to us: we should employ great Parts on unwieldy Projects, as many do, to the disturbance of others, and their own ruine: vast Knowledge would cause us to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value our selves, and contemn others: enjoying continual Health, we should not perceive the benefit thereof, nor be mindful of him that gave it. A sutable mediocrity therefore of these things the Divine Goodness allotteth unto us, that we may neither starve for want, nor surfeit with plenty.</p>
               <p>In fine, the advantages arising from Afflictions are so many, and so great, that (had I time, and were it seasonable to insist largely upon this subject) it were easie to demonstrate, that we have great reason, not only to be contented with, but to rejoyce in, and to be very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for all the crosses and vexations we meet with: to receive them chearfully at God's hand, as the medicines of our Soul, and the condiments of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; as the arguments of his Good
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:104623:175"/>
will, and the instruments of Vertue; as solid grounds of Hope, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table presages of future Joy unto us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Lastly, We are obliged to thank God, not only for Corporeal and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Benefits, but also (and that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally) for Spiritual and eternal Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings. We are apt, as to desire more vehemently, to rejoyce more heartily in the fruition, and more passionately to bewail the loss of temporal good things; so more sincerely and seriously to express our gratitude for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, then for others relating to our Spiritual good, to our everlasting welfare. Wherein we misjudge and misbehave our selves extreamly. For, as much as the reasonable Soul (that goodly Image of the Divine Essence, breathed from the mouth of God) doth in dignity of nature, and purity of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, excel this feculent lump of orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized clay, our Body; as the blissful ravishments of Spirit surpass the dull sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions of Sense; as the bottomless depth of Eternity exceeds that shallow furface of Time, which terminates this transitory life: in such proportion should our appetite unto, our complacence in, our gratitude for spiritual Blessings tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:104623:175"/>
the affections (respectively) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged about these corporeal accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
               <p>Consider that injunction of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to his Disciples; <hi>In this rejoyce not, that the spirits are subject unto you:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 10. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>but rather rejoyce, because your names are written in Heaven. Rejoyce not,</hi> that is, be not at all affected with this, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in it self very rare accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, eminent priviledg, glorious pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of working that indeed greatest of Miracles, subjecting Devils; that is, baffling the shrewdest craft, and subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the strongest force in nature,) in comparison of that delight, which the consideration of the Divine Favour in order to your eternal Felicity doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</p>
               <p>We are, 'tis true, greatly indebted to God for our Creation, for that he hath extracted us from nothing, and placed us in so lofty a rank among his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for the excellent Faculties of Soul and Body, wherewith he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued us; and for many most admirable prerogatives of our outward Estate: but much more for our Redemption, and the wonderful circumstances of unexpressible love and grace therein
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:104623:176"/>
declared; for his descending to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with our Nature, aad elevating us to a participation of his; for digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying us with more illustrious Titles, and instating us in a sure capacity of a much superiour Happiness. Our daily Food deserves well a Grace to be said before and after it: but how much more that constant Provision of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Manna, the Evangelical Verity; those savoury delicacies of Devotion, whereby our Souls are nourished to eternal Life? 'Tis a laudable custom, when we are demanded concerning our health, to answer, <hi>Well, I thank God:</hi> but much more reason have we to say so, if our Conscience can attest concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that sound constitution of Mind, whereby we are disposed vigorously to perform those vertuous functions, due from reasonable nature, and conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Divine Law. If for the prosperous success of our worldly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts; for avoiding dangers, that threatned corporal pain and dammage to us; for defeating the adversaries of our secular quiet, we make <hi>Te Deum laudamus</hi> our <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (our song for victory:) how much more for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py progress of our Spiritual Affairs;
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:104623:176"/>
(affairs of incomparably-highest conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;) for escaping those dreadful hazzards of utter ruine, of endless tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for vanquishing Sin and Hell, those irreconcilable enemies to our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting peace; are we obliged to utter triumphal <hi>Anthymns</hi> of joy and thankfulness?</p>
               <p>This is the order observed by the Psalmist: inciting his <hi>Soul</hi> to <hi>bless God</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 103. 1, &amp;c.</note> for <hi>all his benefits,</hi> he begins with the consideration of God's mercy in pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Sins; then proceeds to his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in bestowing temporal Favours. <hi>Who forgiveth all thy sins,</hi> leads the van; <hi>Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things,</hi> brings up the rere in the enumeration and acknowledgment of God's Benefits. That our minds are illustrated with the knowledg of God and his glorious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, of <hi>Christ</hi> and his blessed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, of that streight path which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducteth to true Happiness; that by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine assistence we are enabled to elude the allurements, to withstand the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences of temptation, to asswage immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate desires, to bridle exorbitant pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, to correct vicious inclinations of mind; requires more our hearty thanks, then for that we were able by our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:104623:177"/>
wit to penetrate the abstrusest Mysteries; or to subjugate Empires by our bodily strength. The forgiveness of our Sins doth more oblige us to a grateful acknowledgment of the Divine Goodness, then should God enrich us with all the treasures contained in the bowels of the Earth, or bottom of the Ocean. One glimpse of his favourable countenance should more enflame our affections, then being invested with all the imaginable splendour of worldly glory.</p>
               <p>Of these inestimable Benefits, and all the advantageous circumstances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are attended, we ought to maintain in our hearts constant resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; to excite our thankfulness, to kindle our love, to quicken our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, by the frequent contemplation of them.</p>
               <p>Thus have I (though, I confess, much more slightly then so worthy a subject did require) prosecuted the several par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars observable in these words. I should conclude with certain Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments persuasive to the practice of this Duty; whereof I have in the tenour both of the former and present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:104623:177"/>
insinuated divers, and could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound many more: but (in compliance with the time) I shall content my self briefly to consider only these three very obvious ones.</p>
               <p>First therefore, We may consider, that there is no disposition what-ever <note place="margin">I.</note> more deeply radicated in the original constitution of all Souls endued with any kind of perception or passion, then being sensible of Benefits received; being kindly affected with love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect toward them that exhibit them; being ready with sutable expressions to acknowledge them, and to endeavour competent recompences for them. The worst of men, the most devoid of all not only piety, but humanity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ingenuity, the most barbarous and most wicked, (whom neither sense of Equity nor respect to Law, no promise of reward or fear of vengeance, can any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise engage to do things just and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or restrain from enormous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,) retain notwithstanding something of this natural inclination, and are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually sensible of good turns done unto them. Experience teaches us thus much; and so doth that sure Oracle of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: <hi>If</hi> (saith he) <hi>you do good to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 6. 33.</note>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:104623:178"/>
                  <hi>those who do good to you, what thanks is it? for even sinners</hi> (that is, men of apparently leud and dissolute conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) <hi>do the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea even Beasts, and those not only the most gentle and sociable of them, (the officious Dog, the tractable Horse, the docile Elephant,) but the wildest also and fiercest of them (the untamable Lion, the cruel Tiger, and ravenous Bear, as stories tell us, and experience attests) bear some kindness, shew some <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Gell. <hi>lib. V. cap.</hi> 14.</note> grateful affection to those that provide for them.</p>
               <p>Neither wild Beasts only, but even inanimate creatures seem not altogether insensible of Benefits, and lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present unto us a natural abhorrence of Ingratitude. The Rivers openly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge into the Sea those waters, which by indiscernible conduits they derived thence: the Heavens remit in bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful showrs what from the Earth they had exhaled in vapour: and the Earth by a fruitful increase repays the culture bestowed thereon; if not, (as the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce,) it deserves <hi>cursing</hi> and <hi>reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> So monstrous a thing, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 8.</note> abominable to nature, is all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:104623:178"/>
And how execrable a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy is it then toward God, from whom alone we receive what-ever we enjoy, what-ever we can expect of good?</p>
               <p>The Second Obligation to this Duty <note place="margin">II.</note> is most just and equal. For, (as <note n="*" place="margin">Laberius.</note> he said well) <hi>Beneficium qui dare nescit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justè petit; He injustly requires</hi> (much more injustly receives) <hi>a benefit, who is not minded to requite it.</hi> In all reason we are indebted for what is freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as well as for what is lent unto us. For the freeness of the giver, his not exacting security, nor expressing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of return, doth not diminish, but rather increase the debt. He that gives, indeed, according to humane (or political) Law, (which, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of publick peace, requires on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a punctual performance of contracts,) transfers his right, and alienates his pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session: but according to that more noble and perfect rule of ingenuity, (the Law which God and Angels and good men chiefly observe, and govern themselves by,) what is given is but committed to the faith, deposited in <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> the hand, treasured up in the custody of him that receives it: and what more palpable iniquity is there, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:104623:179"/>
the trust, or to detain the pledge, not of some inconsiderable trifle, but of inestimable good will? <hi>Exceptâ Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donum</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Benef. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>gente,</hi> (saith <hi>Seneca) non est ulla data adversus ingratum actio: In no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (excepting the</hi> Macedonians) <hi>an action could be preferred against ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful persons, as so.</hi> (Though <hi>Xenophon,</hi> no mean Authour, reports, that among the <hi>Persians</hi> also there were judgments assigned, and punishments appointed for Ingratitude.) However, in the court of Heaven, and at the tribunal of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, no offender is more constantly arraigned, none more surely condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, none more severely punished, then the ingrateful man.</p>
               <p>Since therefore we have received all from the Divine Bounty; if God should in requital exact, that we sacrifice our lives to the testimony of his Truth; that we employ our utmost pains, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend our whole estate, adventure our health, and prostitute all our earthly contents to his service; since he did but revoke his own, 'twere great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice to refuse compliance with his demands: how much more, when he only expects from us, and requires some few acknowledgments of our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:104623:179"/>
to him, some little portions of our substance, for the relief of them that need, some easie observances of his most reasonable commands?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This is a most sweet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful <note place="margin">III.</note> Duty. <hi>Praise the Lord,</hi> (saith <note place="margin">Psal. 135. 3.</note> the most experienced Psalmist) <hi>for the Lord is good; sing praises to his Name, for it is pleasant:</hi> and otherwhere, <hi>Praise</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 147. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord, for it is good to sing praises to our God; for it is pleasant, and praise is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Psal. 9 1.</note> 
                  <hi>comely.</hi> The performance of this Duty, as it especially proceeds from good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and a chearful disposition of mind; so it feeds and foments them; both root and fruit thereof are hugely sweet and sapid. Whence S. <hi>James; If any man be afflicted, let him pray; is any merry, let him sing Psalms. (Psalms,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jam 5. 13.</note> the proper matter of which is praise and thanksgiving.)</p>
               <p>Other Duties of Devotion have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing laborious in them, something dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustful to our sense. Prayer minds us of our wants and imperfections; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession induces a sad remembrance of our misdeeds and bad deserts: but Thanksgiving includes nothing uneasie or unpleasant; nothing but the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and sense of exceeding Goodness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:104623:180"/>
All Love is sweet; but that especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which arises, not from a bare appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension only of the object's worth and dignity, but from a feeling of its singular beneficence and usefulness unto us. And what thought can enter into the heart of man more comfortable and delicious then this, That the great Master of all things, the most wise and mighty King of Heaven and Earth hath entertained a gracious regard, hath expressed a real kindness toward us? that we are in capacity to honour, to please, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent an acceptable sacrifice to him, who can render us perfectly happy? that we are admitted to the practice of that wherein the supreme joy of Paradise, and the perfection of Angelical bliss consists? For Praise and Thansgiving are the most delectable business of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and God grant they may be our greatest delight, our most frequent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment upon earth.</p>
               <p>To these I might add such farther considerations. That this Duty is of all most acceptable to God, and most <note place="margin">
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vid.</hi> Psal. 69. 30, 31.</p>
                     <p>Psal. 50. 13, 14, 23.</p>
                  </note> profitable to us. That Gratitude for Benefits procures more, disposing God to bestow, and qualifying us to receive them. That the serious performance of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:104623:180"/>
this Duty efficaciously promotes, and facilitates the practice of other Duties; since the more we are sensible of our obligations to God, the more ready we shall be to please him, by obedience to his Commandments. What S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid. diviniss.</hi> Chrysost. <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum Tom. V. pag.</hi> 76.</note> saith of Prayer, It is impossible that he who with competent promptitude of mind doth constantly apply himself thereto, should ever sin, is most espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially true of this part of Devotion: for how can we at the same time be sensible of God's Goodness to us, and willingly offend him? That the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of past Benefits, and sense of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, confirms our Faith, and nourishes our hope of future. That the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Divine Beneficence mightily strengthen the obligation of this Duty; especially his absolute freeness in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and our total unworthiness to receive; our very Ingratitude it self affording strong inducements to Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. That giving thanks hath <hi>de facto</hi> been always the principal part of all Religion; (whether instituted by Divine Command, or prompted by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reason, or propagated by general Tradition;) the Ethnick devotion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting (as it were totally) in the praise
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:104623:181"/>
of their gods, and acknowledgment of their Benefits; the <hi>Jewish,</hi> more then half in Eucharistical oblations, and in solemn commemorations of providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial favours; and that of the ancient Christians so far forth, that by-standers <note place="margin">Plin. <hi>Epist.</hi>
                  </note> could hardly discern any other thing in their religious practice, then that they sang Hymns to <hi>Christ,</hi> and by mutual Sacraments obliged themselves to abstain from all Villany. But I will rather wholly omit the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these pregnant Arguments, then be farther offensive to your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>

That the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Prayers for Kings</hi> is a Christian Duty of great importance. (S. <hi>Paul</hi> judging fit to <hi>exhort</hi> thereto <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>that before all things</hi> it should be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.) 2. That it is incumbent on the Pastours of the Church, (such as S. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> was,) to take special care, that this Duty should be performed in the Church; both publickly in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and privately in the Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of each Christian: according to what the Apostle, after the proposing divers enforcements of this Duty, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth in the 8th ver. <hi>I will therefore, that men pray every-where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath or doubting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first of these particulars, That it is a Duty of great importance <hi>to pray for Kings,</hi> I shall insist upon: it being indeed now very fit and seasonable to urge the practice of it, when it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps commonly not much considered, or not well observed; and when there
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:104623:183"/>

               <p n="1">I. The Apostle exhorteth Christians to <hi>pray for Kings</hi> with all sorts of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>deprecations,</hi> for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting evils from them; with <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>petitions,</hi> for obtaining good things to them; with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional intercessions,</hi> for needful gifts and graces to be collated on them: as, after S. <hi>Austin,</hi> Interpreters, in expounding S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, commonly distinguish; <note place="margin">Aug. <hi>Ep.</hi> 59. Beza, Groti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, &amp;c.</note> how accurately, I shall not discuss; it sufficing, that assuredly the Apostle meaneth, under this variety of expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to comprehend all kinds of Prayer. And to this I say we are obliged upon divers accounts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Common Charity should dispose
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:104623:183"/>
us to pray for Kings. This Christian disposition inclineth to universal bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and beneficence; according to that Apostolical precept, <hi>As we have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, let us do good unto all men:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10.</note> it consequently will excite us to pray for all men; seeing this is a way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting good will, and exercising benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, which any man at any time, if he hath the will and heart, may have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and ability to pursue.</p>
               <p>No man indeed otherwise can benefit all; few men otherwise can benefit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; some men otherwise can benefit none: but in this way any man is able to benefit all, or unconfinedly to oblige mankind, deriving on any somewhat of God's immense beneficence. By per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this good Office, at the expence of a few good wishes addressed to the Sovereign Goodness, the poorest may prove benefactours to the richest, the meanest to the highest, the weakest to the mightiest of men: so we may bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit even those who are most remote from us, most strangers and quite unknown to us. Our Prayers can reach the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ends of the Earth; and by them our Charity may embrace all the world.</p>
               <p>And from them surely <hi>Kings</hi> must
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:104623:184"/>
not be excluded. For if because all men are our Fellow-creatures, and brethren by the same Heavenly Father, because all men are allied to us by cognation and similitude of Nature, because all men are the objects of God's particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and care; if because all men are partakers of the common Redemption, by the undertakings of him who is the common Mediatour and Saviour of all men; and because all men, according to the gracious intent and desire of God, are designed for a consortship in the same blessed Inheritance; (which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Context doth <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 4, 5, 6.</note> intimate;) if, in fine, because all men do need Prayers, and are capable of benefit from them, we should be chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably disposed to pray for them: then must we also pray for <hi>Kings,</hi> who even in their personal capacity, as men, do share in all those conditions. Thus may we conceive S. <hi>Paul</hi> here to argue: <hi>For all men,</hi> saith he, <hi>for Kings;</hi> that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently <hi>for Kings,</hi> or, particularly <hi>for Kings;</hi> to pray for whom, at least no less then for other men, universal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity should dispose us.</p>
               <p>Indeed, even on this account we may say, especially <hi>for Kings;</hi> the law of
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:104623:184"/>
general Charity with peculiar advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage being applicable to them: for that Law commonly is expressed with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to our Neighbour, that is, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with whom we have to do, who come under our particular notice, who by any intercourse are approximated to us; and such are <hi>Kings</hi> especially. For whereas the greatest part of men (by reason of their distance from us, from the obscurity of their condition, or for want of opportunity to converse with them) must needs slip beside us, so that we cannot employ any distinct thought or affection toward them: it is not so with Kings, who by their emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and illustrious Station become ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry observable by us; with whom we have frequent transactions, and mutual concerns; who therefore in the strictest acception are our neighbours, whom we are charged to love as our selves; to whom consequently we must perform this most charitable office of praying for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To impress which consideration, we may reflect, that commonly we have <note place="margin">

                  </note> only this way granted us of exercising our Charity toward Princes; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing situated alost above the reach of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

For as in divers other respects they resemble the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; so in this they are like it, that we may say to them, as the Psalmist to God, <hi>Thou art my Lord; my goodness exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 16. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>not to thee.</hi> Yet this case may be reserved, wherein the poorest Soul may benefit the greatest Prince, imparting the richest and choicest goods to him: He may be indebted for his safety, for the prosperity of his affairs, for God's mercy and favour toward him, to the Prayers of his meanest vassal. And thus to oblige Princes, methinks, we should be very desirous; we should be glad to use such an advantage, we should be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of such an honour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are bound to pray for Kings out of Charity to the Publick; because their Good is a general Good, and the Communities of men (both Church and State) are greatly concerned in the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings by Prayer derived on them.</p>

               <p>The Wealth and Power of a Prince are the supports, and securities of a State: he thereby being enabled to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and defend its safety, its order, its peace; to protect his people from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign injuries and invasions; to secure them from intestine broils and factions; to repress outrages and oppressions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noying <note place="margin">Psal. 72. 4—</note> them.</p>
               <p>The Prosperity of a Prince is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable from the prosperity of his People; they ever partaking of his fortunes, and thriving or suffering with him.

                  </note> reverence, to honour, to obey Kings, we should look on Prayer for them as a principal branch, and the neglect thereof as a notable breach of those du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For,</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reverence,</hi> it is plain, that no exteriour signification, in ceremonious unveiling or cringing to them, can so demonstrate it, as doth the wishing them well in our hearts, and from thence framing particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to the Divine Majesty for their welfare. Then which practice there can be no surer argument, that we hold them in great account and consideration. And how indeed can we much honour them, for whom we do not vouchsafe so much as to offer our good wishes, or to mention them in our intercessions unto him, who requireth us to make them for all men, and particularly for those for whom we are concerned? Doth not this omission evidently place them in the lowest rank, beneath the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:104623:194"/>
meanest of our friends and relations? doth it not imply a very slender regard had to them?</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Obedience,</hi> Prayer for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is clearly an instance thereof; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it may be supposed, that all Princes do require it from their Subjects. Not only Christian Princes, who believe God the sole Dispenser of all good things, and the great efficacy of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in procuring them from him, may be deemed to exact this beneficial office from us; but even Heathens and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, from their dim notion of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Providence, (which hath ever been common in the World,) have made an account of this practice: as we may see by that Decree of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> King in <hi>Ezra,</hi> charging his Officers to furnish the <hi>Jewish</hi> Elders with sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, <hi>that,</hi> said he, <hi>they may offer sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi>

               <p>All Princes indeed do need them.

All Princes having many avocations, and temptations, hindring them to pray e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for themselves, do need supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental

Seeing then He hath enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that in order to our obtaining those great Benefits, which issue from his special care over Princes, we should pray for it, and seek it from his hands; the omission of this duty will intercept it, or bereave us of its advantages; nor in that case may we expect any blessings of that kind. As without praying for our selves, we must not expect private favours from Heaven; so without pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our Prince, we cannot well hope for publick blessings. For, as a profane person (who in effect disavoweth God, by not regarding to seek his favour and
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:104623:199"/>
aid) is not qualified to receive any good from him: so a profane Nation (which disclaimeth God's Government of the world, by not invoking his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction on those who moderate it under him) is not well capable of common benefits. It is upon all accounts true which <hi>Ezra</hi> said, <hi>The hand of our God is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ezra 8. 22.</note>

                  <hi>them that forsake him.</hi> If therefore we desire that our Prince should not lose God's special regard, if we would not forfeit the benefits thereof to our selves, we must conspire in hearty Prayers for him.</p>
               <p n="10">10. To engage and encourage us in which practice, we may farther consider, that such Prayers, offered duly, (with frequency and constancy, with sincerity and zeal,) do always turn to good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and never want good effect: the which if it be not always easily discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible, yet it is certainly real; if it be not perfect as we may desire, yet it is competent, as expediency requireth, or as the condition of things will bear.</p>
               <p>There may be impediments to a full success of the best Prayers; they may not ever prevail to render Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:104623:199"/>
good, or extreamly prosperous: For some concurrence of their own will is requisite to produce their Vertue, God rarely working with irresistible power, or fatal efficacy; and the state of things, or capacities of Persons, are not always fitly suted for prosperity. Yet are not such Prayers ever wholly vain or fruitless: For God never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth means unavailable to the end; he never would have commanded us particularly to pray for Kings, if he did not mean to bestow a good issue to that practice.</p>
               <p>And, surely, he that hath promised to hear all requests with faith, and sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and incessant earnestness presented to him, cannot fail to hear those which are of such consequence, which are so agreeable to his will, which do include so much honesty and charity. In this case, surely, we may have some confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, according to that of S. <hi>John, This</hi>

If the Offices of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and of the Churches truckling under it, in latter times, shall seem more defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or sparing in this point of service; the reason may be, for that a superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive regard to the <hi>Solar</hi> or <hi>Pontifical</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (as Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished) did obscure their devotion for the <hi>Lunar</hi> or <hi>Regal</hi> Majesty. But our Church hath been abundantly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that we should in most ample man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner discharge this Duty; having in each of her Holy Offices directed us to pray for our King in expressions most full, hearty, and lively.</p>
               <p>She hath indeed been charged as somewhat lavish or over-liberal of her Devotions in this case. But it is a good fault, and we little nead fear over-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in observance of a Precept so very reasonable, and so important; suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that we have a due care to joyn our heart with the Churche's words, and to the frequency of Prayers for our Prince do confer a sutable fervency, If we be not dead, or meerly formal, we can hardly be too copious in this kind of Devotion; reiteration of words can do no harm, being accompanied with renovation of our desires.

And if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Charity should dispose us to resent the Good of Princes with complacence; if their Welfare be a publick benefit; if our selves are interested in it, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take great advantages thereby; if in equity and ingenuity we are bound to seek it; then, surely, we are much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to thank God, the bountiful Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it, for his goodness in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it.</p>

<pb n="400" facs="tcp:104623:208"/>
grand Benefits by the Divine Goodness bestowed on our King, and on our selves, which this day we are bound with all grateful acknowledgment to commemorate. Wherefore in stead of reciting trite stories, and urging obvious reasons, (which a small recollection will suggest to you,) I shall only request you to joyn with me in the practice of the Duty, and in acclamation of praise to God.

               <p>IF we should search about for a Case parallel to that which we do now commemorate, we should perhaps, hardly find one more patly such, then is that which is implied in this Psalm: and if we would know the Duties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on us in reference to such an Occasion, we could scarce better learn them other-where then in our Text.</p>
               <p>With attention perusing the Psalm, we may therein observe, That its great Authour was apprehensive of a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Plot by a confederacy of wicked and spitefull enemies, with great craft
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:104623:210"/>
and secrecy, contrived against his safety. <hi>They,</hi> saith he, <hi>encourage themselves in an</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>evil matter; they commune of laying snares privily; they say, who shall see them?</hi> That for preventing the blow threatned by this design, (whereof he had some glimpse, or some presumption, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the knowledge of their impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable and active malice) he doth implore Divine protection: <hi>Hide me,</hi> saith he, <hi>from the secret counsel of the wicked, from</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>the insurrection of the workers of iniquity.</hi> That he did conside in God's Mercy and Justice for the seasonable defeating, for the fit avenging their machination: <hi>God,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall shoot at them with</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>an arrow; suddenly shall they be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> That they should themselves become the detectours of their crime, and the instruments of the exemplary punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due thereunto: <hi>They</hi> (added he) <hi>shall make their own tongue to fall upon</hi>

                  <hi>themselves: all that see them, shall flee away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such was the Case; the which unto what passage in the history it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, or whether it belongeth to any we have recorded, it may not be easie to determine. Expositours commonly do refer it to the designs of <hi>Saul</hi> upon
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:104623:210"/>
                  <hi>David's</hi> life. But this seeming purely conjecture, not founded upon any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press words, or pregnant intimations in the text, I shall leave that inquiry in its own uncertainty. It sufficeth to make good its pertinency, that there was such a mischievous Conspiracy, deeply projected against <hi>David;</hi> (a very great personage, in whose safety the publick state of God's people was principally concerned; he being then King of <hi>Israel,</hi> at least in designation, and therefore in the precedent Psalm, endited in <hi>Saul</hi>'s time, is so styled;) <note place="margin">Psal. 63. 11.</note> from the peril whereof he by the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Providence of God was rescued, with the notable disappointment and grievous confusion of those who mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it. The which Case (at least in kind, if not in degree) beareth a plain resemblance to that which lieth before us.</p>
               <p>And the Duties which upon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion are signified to concern people then, do no less now sort to us; the which, as they lie couched in our Text, are these: 1. <hi>wisely</hi> to <hi>consider God's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> 2. to <hi>fear;</hi> 3. to <hi>declare God's work;</hi> 4. to <hi>be glad in the Lord;</hi> 5. to <hi>trust in God;</hi> 6. to <hi>glory.</hi> Of which the

First Three are represented as more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally concerning men; the others as appertaining more peculiarly to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and upright persons.</p>
               <p>These Duties it shall be my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour somewhat to explain and press, in a manner applicable to the present case. I call them Duties; and to warrant the doing so, it is requisite to consider, that all these particulars may be understood in a double manner, either as declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of event, or as directive of practice upon such emergencies.</p>
               <p>When God doth so interpose his hand, as signally to check and confound mischievous enterprises; it will be apt to stir up in the minds of men an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of God's special Providence, to strike into their hearts a dread of his Power and Justice, to wring from their mouths sutable declarations and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments; and particularly then good men will be affected with pious joy, they will be incouraged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in God, they will be moved to glory, or to express a triumphant satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in God's proceedings. These e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents naturally do result from such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential occurrences; for production of these events such occurrences are
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:104623:211"/>
purposely designed; and accordingly (where men are not by profane opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or affections much indisposed) they do commonly follow.</p>
               <p>But yet they are not purposed simply as Events, but also as matters of Duty: for men are obliged readily to admit such impressions upon their minds, hearts, and lives, from the special works of Providence: they are bound, not to cross those natural tendencies, not to frustrate those wise intents of God, ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at the production of such good dispositions and good practices: whence if those effects do not arise, as often no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously they do not in some persons, men thereby do incurre much guilt and blame.</p>
               <p>It is indeed ordinary to represent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of duty in this way, expressing those practices consequent in effect, which in obligation should follow, according to God's purpose, and the nature of causes ordered by him. As when, for instance, God in the Law had prescribed Duty, and threatned sore punishment on the disobedient, it is subjoyned, <hi>And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no</hi>

               <p>There are many who, in such cases, are no-wise apprehensive of God's spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Providence, or affected with it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do not consider, or do not consider wisely and intelligently.</p>
               <p>Some are very inobservant and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in regard to things of this nature; so drowzy and heedless, as not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to what-ever passeth, or to mind what God acteth in the world: such as those of whom the Prophet saith, <hi>The</hi>

               <p>Others, (although they do ken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what is done, as matter of news, or story, entertaining curiosity and talk; yet) out of sloth or stupidity, do little consider it, or study whence it sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth; contenting themselves with none, or with any superficial account, which fancy or appearance suggesteth: like beasts, they do take in things obvious to their sense, and perhaps stand gazing on them; but do not make any careful reflexion, or inquiry into their original causes and reasons; taking (as a dog, when he biteth the stone flung at him, or as a child that is angry with the log he falleth on) what-ever appeareth next, to be the principal cause: such as the Psalmist again toucheth, when he saith, <hi>A brutish man knoweth not, neither doth a</hi>

well understand these matters; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of their care and study about them being to father them on wrong causes, ascribing them to the meer conduct and agency of visible causes, hurried by a necessary swindge, or rolling on by a casual fluctuation of things; not descry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's hand in them, but profanely discarding and disclaiming it: such as those in the Psalms, who so reflected on Providence, as to say, <hi>How doth God</hi>

               <p>The special Providence of God in events here effected or ordered by him, is indeed commonly not discernible without good judgment and great care; it is not commonly impressed upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents in characters so big and clear, as to be legible to every eye, or to any eye not endued with a sharp perspica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not implying an industrious heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness: the tracts thereof are too fine and subtil to be descried by a dimme sight, with a transient glance, or upon a gross veiw: it is seldome so very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous, that persons incredulous, or
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:104623:214"/>
any-wise indisposed to admit it, can easily be convinced thereof, or constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to acknowledg it: it is often (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many accounts, from many causes) very obscure, and not easily discernible to the most sagacious, most watchful, most willing observers. For, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of Providence being free a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, acting with unaccountable varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nothing can happen, which may not be imputed to them, with some colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pretence. Divine and humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences are so twisted and knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it is hard to sever them. The manner of Divine efficacy is so very soft and gentle, that we cannot easily trace its footsteps. God designeth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to exert his hand in a notorious way, but often purposely doth conceal it. Whereas also it is not fit to charge upon God's special hand of Providence any event, wherein special ends of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or goodness do not shine; it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hard to discover such ends, which usually are wrap'd in perplexities; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God acteth variously, (according to the circumstances of things, and the disposition, capacity, or state of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,) so as to doe the same thing for different ends, and different things for
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:104623:215"/>
the same end: because there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ends, unto which Providence in various order and measure hath regard, which our short and narrow prospect cannot reach: because God, in prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his ends, is not wont to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the most direct and compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way; but windeth about in a large circuit, enfolding many concurrent and subordinate designs: because the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of things to be permitted or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, doth not consist in single acts or events, but in many conspiring to one common end: because we cannot apprehend the consequences, nor bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the conveniencies of things in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to good ends: because we are apt to measure things by their congruity to our opinions, expectations, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: because many proceedings of God depend upon grounds inaccessible to our apprehension; such as his own secret Decrees, the knowledge of mens thoughts, close purposes, clandestine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, true qualifications and merits; his prescience of contingent events and what the result will be from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of numberless causes: because sometimes he doth act in methods of Wisdom, and by rules of Justice, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:104623:215"/>
our capacity to know either from the finiteness of our nature, or the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eebleness of our reason, or the meanness of our state, and circumstances here: because also the Divine administration of affairs hath no compleat determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or final issue here; that being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to the great day of reckoning and judgment. It is further also expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that many occurrences should be puzzling to us, to quash our presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to exercise our faith, to quicken our industry, to engage us upon ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing that Wisedom which we cannot comprehend. Upon such accounts, for such causes, (which time will not give me leave to explain and exemplifie) the special Providence of God is often cloudy, is seldom so clear, that without great heed and confideration we can perceive it. But however to do so is plainly our duty; and therefore pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
               <p>For our Reason was not given us to be idle upon so important occasions; or that we should be as brute Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of what God doeth. He, surely, in the Governance of his noblest crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture here discovereth his Being, and displayeth his Attributes, we therefore
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:104623:216"/>
carefully should observe it. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (and no otherwise in a publick way) doth continually <hi>speak,</hi> and signifie to us his mind: and fit it is, that we his <note place="margin">Psal. 50. 1. &amp; 60. 6. &amp; 62. 11.</note> subjects should hear, should attend to the least intimations of his pleasure. To him thence glory should accrue, the which who but we can render? and that we may render it, we must know the grounds of it. In fine, for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of God's Kingdom, for upholding the reverence due to his administration of Justice among us, it is requisite, that by apparent dispensation of recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Duty should be encouraged, and Disobedience checked.: very foolish therefore we must be, if we regard not such dispensations.</p>
               <p>So Reason dictateth, and Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more plainly declareth our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to consider, and perceive God's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. To doe so is recommended to us as a singular point of wisedom: <hi>whose</hi>

               <p>THE context runs thus: <hi>The Lord hath sworn in truth unto David, he will not turn from it, Of the fruit of thy body I will set upon thy throne. If thy children will keep my covenant, and the testimony that I shall teach them; their children also shall sit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy throne for evermore. For the Lord hath chosen Sion; he hath desired it for his habitation. This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell, for I have desired it. I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfie her poor with bread. I WILL ALSO CLOATH HER PRIESTS WITH SALVATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON, and her Saints shall shout aloud for joy. There will I make the horn of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid to bud,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

If all, not only Inaugurations of persons, but Dedications even of inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate things to some extraordinary use, hath been usually attended with espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial significations of joy, and festival so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity; with great reason, the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of a person to so high and sacred a Function, as that of a Christian Bishop, (that is, of a Prince, or principal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour in God's Church,) requires most peculiar testimonies of our gratulation and content: the face of things ought then to be serene and chearful; the thoughts of men benign and favourable; the words comfortable and auspicious, that are uttered upon such occasion. And that ours at present should be such, the subject as well as the season of our Discourse doth require. Words few, but pregnant, and affording ample matter for our best affections to work upon: and which more particularly will engage us both to a hearty thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness for past Benefits, and to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident expectation of future Blessings; while they acquaint us with the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent exhibition of a gracious Promise, re-mind us of the faithful performance thereof hitherto, and assure us of its certain accomplishment for the future.
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:104623:239"/>
The occasion whereof was this.</p>
               <p>King <hi>David,</hi> moved by a devout in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to promote God's Honour, and benefit the Church, had vowed to build a magnificent Temple, imploring God's propitious concurrence with, and approbation of his design. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Almighty God not only declares his acceptance of that pious resolution, but rewards it with a bountiful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, consisting of two parts; one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, relating to <hi>David</hi>'s Children and posterity, that they in an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted succession should for ever enjoy the Royal dignity, in case they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly persist in observing his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the Testimonies that he should teach them; the other more absolute, that however, what he chiefly intended concerning God's established Worship, and the perpetual welfare of the Church, God would have an especial care that it should fully and certainly be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished: that he would for ever fix his residence in <hi>Sion;</hi> that he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and prosper it, and all that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long thereto; especially those that did most need his favour and assistence, the Poor, the Priests, and the Saints, (or <hi>gentle ones.)</hi> This is briefly the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <note place="margin">

II. The Persons whom the Promise mainly regards, <hi>her Priests. Priests,</hi> that is, persons peculiarly devoted to, and employed in Sacred matters; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished expressely from the <hi>Poor,</hi> (that is, other meek and humble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;) and from the <hi>Saints,</hi> (that is, all other good and religious men.) And, <hi>her</hi> Priests; that is, the Priests of <hi>Sion:</hi> of that <hi>Sion</hi> which <hi>the Lord hath chosen;</hi> which <hi>he hath desired for his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Contrd,</hi> 2 Chron. 7. 21.</note> permanent <hi>habitation;</hi> which he hath resolved to <hi>rest,</hi> and <hi>reside in for ever.</hi> Whence it plainly enough follows, that the Priests and Pastours of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church are hereby, if not solely, yet principally designed. Which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, because it is in a manner the foundation of our subsequent Discourse, and by some it may perhaps not be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily admitted, I shall endeavour farther to confirm by these few Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because the Covenant here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned is not (as to the main parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) of a conditional or temporary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but absolute and perpetual; and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> 2 Chron. 7. 16.</note> must therefore be understood to respect the <hi>Christian</hi> Church, (that of the <hi>Jews</hi> being long since rejected, their Temple demolished, their <hi>Sion</hi> utterly
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:104623:241"/>
forsaken.) For although one particular contained therein, concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual succession of <hi>David</hi>'s posterity in the Regal authority over <hi>Israel,</hi> hath a condition explicitly annexed; (and, consequently, the effects depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the performance of that condition were contingent, and mutable;) yet all the rest of this Covenant (or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise) is conceived in terms perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and expressly importing perpetuity. <hi>This is my rest for ever,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, (as the <hi>Greek</hi> Translatours render it,) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>(in seculum seculi,)</hi> that is, to the end of the world; as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> denotes the end of all worlds, or the most perfect sempiterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And that it doth really in this case denote a proper and unlimited perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, is also evident by those explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof in the 89 <hi>Psalm,</hi> (where the very same Covenant is, as to some parts thereof, more largely recorded.) <hi>Once have I sworn by my Holiness, that I</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 35, 36, 37.</note> 
                  <hi>will not lie unto David: His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the Sun before me: It shall be established for ever as the Moon, and as a faithful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in heaven.</hi> No words can express more fully a perpetual duration, or at
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:104623:241"/>
least one co-extended with the duration of the world, then those do. And the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> referring also to this very Covenant, and particularly to this very clause thereof, thus expresses the matter: <hi>Thus saith the Lord; If you can</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <p>Jer. 33. 20, 21.</p>

                        <hi>Vid.</hi> 2 Chron. 7. 16.</p>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>break my covenant of the day, and my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the night; and that there should not be day and night in their sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: Then may also my Covenant be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with David my servant, that he should not have a Son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the Priests, my Ministers.</hi> But farther,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The completion of this individual Promise is both by the Prophets fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, and expressed by the Evangelists, to appertain to the times of the Gospel. Ye heard even now the words of <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> which are by him applied to those times, when God would cause <hi>the Branch</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 33. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>of righteousness</hi> (that is, <hi>Jesus</hi> of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> our Blessed Saviour) <hi>to grow up unto David; who should execute judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and righteousness in the Land. In those days</hi> (saith he farther) <hi>shall Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the Name wherewith she shall be called,</hi> (or rather, <hi>which he shall be called,</hi> as not only the Vulgar <hi>Latine</hi>
                  <pb n="468" facs="tcp:104623:242"/>
and the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters, but the <hi>Chaldee</hi> also reade it,) <hi>THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</hi> Likewise in the 55. of <hi>Isaiah</hi> God thus invites the Gentiles; <hi>Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your soul</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 55. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>shall live: and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David:</hi> that is, I will ratifie that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Covenant, which, in your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, I once made with <hi>David,</hi> and will confer on you those favours which I faithfully promised him; relating to this very Promise also. For both in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Prayer, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.) which in all probability was indited about the same time, and upon the same occasion with this Psalm, and in the 89. Psalm, the benefits of this same covenant are called <hi>the mercies of David. O Lord</hi>

                  <hi>God, turn not away the face of thine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, remember the mercies of David thy servant,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon:</hi> And, <hi>My mercy</hi> (saith God) <hi>will I keep with him</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 89. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him:</hi> and, <hi>My faithfulness and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>my mercy shall be with him;</hi> that is, <hi>my faithful</hi> (or <hi>sure) mercy;</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And in the Song of <hi>Zachary</hi> we have one passage of this Promise cited, and applied to the times of the Gospel: <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 1. 68, 69, 70.</note> 
                  <hi>hath visited and redeemed his people; and hath raised up a horn of Salvation in the house of his servant David; as he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets: viz.</hi> by the mouth of this Prophetical Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist here, where 'tis said, <hi>There will I make the horn of David to bud;</hi> and in the parallel <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. <hi>In my Name shall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>his horn be exalted.</hi> To omit those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places where our Saviour, in corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence to this Promise, is affirmed to <hi>possess the throne of his father David,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> Luc. 1. 32. <hi>edit. Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.</hi>
                  </note> and <hi>to rule over the house of Jacob for ever.</hi> Moreover,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That by the <hi>Sion</hi> here mentioned is not chiefly meant that material Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in <hi>Judaea,</hi> but rather that mystical Rock of Divine Grace, and Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Truth, upon which the Christian Church, the only everlasting Temple of God, is unmovably seated, is very probable, (or rather manifestly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,) by the Prophets constant accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof in this sense, when they assign the character of perpetual dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility thereto. As in <hi>Isa.</hi> 60. where he
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:104623:243"/>
thus prophesies of the Christian Church; <hi>The sons also of them that afflicted thee</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 60. 14, 15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>shall come bending unto thee, and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee The City of the Lord, The Sion of the Holy One of Israel. Whereas thou hast been forsaken, and hated, so that no man went through thee; I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breasts of Kings,</hi> &amp;c. And the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> speaking of <hi>the last days,</hi> (that is, of the Evangelical Times, <hi>when the mountain of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mic. 4. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>the House of the Lord should be established in the top of the mountains,)</hi> saith thus; <hi>And I will make her that halted, a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>and her that was cast far off, a strong Nation: and the Lord shall reign over them in mount Sion from henceforth even for ever.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> speaking of the same times, (when God <hi>would pour out his Spirit upon all flesh,)</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Joel 2. 28.</note> hath these words: <hi>So shall ye know that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">&amp; 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the Lord your God, dwelling in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.</hi> All which places no man can reasonably doubt,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:104623:243"/>
and all Christians do firmly consent to respect the Christian Church. To which we may add that passage of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ch. 12. v. 22. <hi>But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the City of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem;</hi> that is, to the Christian Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The manner of this Covenant's delivery, and confirmation by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Oath, argues the inconditionate, irreversible, and perpetual constitution thereof: for to God's most absolute and immutable Decrees this most august and solemn confimation doth peculiarly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. So the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> seems to intimate: <hi>Wherein</hi> (saith he) <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>God willing more abundantly to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the immutability of his counsel,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,) <hi>interposed an oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may therefore (I suppose) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these grounds solidly and safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that this Promise doth principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong, and shall therefore infallibly be made good to the Christian Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; to those who in the Christian Church, by offering Spiritual Sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving, by directing and instructing the people in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:104623:244"/>
of the Evangelical Law, by implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for and pronouncing upon them the Divine benedictions, do bear ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy with, and supply the room of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Priesthood.</p>
               <p>From which discourse we may by the way deduce this Corollary; That the title of <hi>Priest,</hi> although it did (as most certainly it doth not) properly and primarily signifie a <hi>Jewish</hi> Sacrificer, (or Slaughterer of Beasts,) doth yet no-wise deserve that reproach which is by some inconsiderately, (not to say, profanely,) upon that mistaken ground, commonly cast upon it: since the Holy Scripture it self, we see, doth here, even in that sense (most obnoxious to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception) ascribe it to the Christian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours. And so likewise doth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Isaiah; And I will also take of them for Priests and for Levites, saith the Lord:</hi> speaking (as the context plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Isa. 66. 21.</note> declares) of the Gentiles, which should be converted and aggregated to God's Church. And the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah; Neither shall the Priests the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 33. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>want a man before me to offer burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.</hi> Which Prophecy also evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the same time and state of things;
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:104623:244"/>
of which the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> thus foretels: <hi>For from the rising of the Sun</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 1. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>to the going down of the same, my Name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place Incense shall be offered to my Name, and a pure offering.</hi> It were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable therefore, that men would better consider, before they entertain such groundless offences, or pass so uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable censures upon either words, or persons, or things.

that bitter adversary of <hi>David</hi> (in <hi>Psal.</hi> 109.) did <hi>cloath himself with cursing, as with a garment.</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> avoucheth <note place="margin">Vers. 18.</note> of himself, <hi>I put on righteousness, and it</hi>

                  <hi>cloathed me; my judgment was as a robe, and a diadem.</hi> And S. <hi>Peter</hi> advises us to <hi>put on,</hi> or to <hi>be cloathed with humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Finally, <hi>Isaiah</hi> introduces our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 5.</note> speaking thus: <hi>I will greatly rejoyce</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 61, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God: for he hath cloathed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness; as a</hi>

                  <hi>bridegroom decketh himself with orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and as a bride adorneth her self with her jewels.</hi> So that (as by these instances we may discern) <hi>to be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with salvation,</hi> is, to be perfectly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed therewith; to be invested with it as with a garment, which wholly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closeth and covereth the body, so that no part is left unguarded and unadorned thereby.</p>
               <p>Secondly, But now what is that <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> with which the <hi>Priests</hi> of <hi>Sion</hi> shall be thus cloathed? I answer: <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> when it is put absolutely, and not conjoyned with any particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, (or term from which,) doth in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> language properly signifie a
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:104623:245"/>
Deliverance from, or remotion of all sorts of inconveniences; and, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, an Affluence of all good things; and, in effect, the same which other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages call Felicity and Prosperity, or design by terms equivalent to those: the <hi>Hebrews</hi> having hardly any other word so properly correspondent to those, as this word, <hi>Salvation.</hi> Whence that title of <hi>Saviour,</hi> and <hi>the God of Salvation,</hi> so often attributed to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, imports as much as, the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deus,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>We will recite one or two of those many places which confirm this notion.
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:104623:246"/>
                  <hi>Psalm</hi> 85. 9. <hi>Surely his Salvation is nigh them that fear him, that glory may dwell in our land: his Salvation is nigh,</hi> that is, his loving care attends upon them, to assist and preserve them: which in <hi>Psal.</hi> 145. 19. is thus otherwise expressed; <hi>He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; he will hear their cry, and will save them.</hi> And again, <hi>Psalm</hi> 149. 4. <hi>The Lord ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth pleasure in his people; he will beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the meek with Salvation:</hi> that is, he will by his good Providence dispose them into a convenient and decent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of life. And again, <hi>Psalm</hi> 144. <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>It is he that giveth Salvation unto Kings;</hi> that is, by whose gracious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal they prosper, and are preserved in dignity, plenty, and safety.</p>
               <p>I will not, by citation of places, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to confirm so obvious a Notion: it may suffice for that purpose, that the supreme accomplishment of all Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the enjoyment of perfect Bliss in Heaven, is, in agreement with this <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> acception of the word, most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly styled <hi>Salvation.</hi> But I must add, that whereas Salvation may relate either to the outward estate of a man's body, life, and fortunes, or to the internal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of the mind; to our present
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:104623:246"/>
condition in this world, or to our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and eternal estate: it doth seem here (I say not, to exclude the latter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, yet) more directly and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to respect the former, <hi>viz.</hi> that external and temporal welfare, which is conspicuous and visible in this world. My reason is, Because the other parts of this prophetical Promise do, in their most natural acception, signifie that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Prosperity wherewith God would vouchsafe to bless his Church: that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant <hi>benediction of her store,</hi> that <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying her poor with bread,</hi> that <hi>joyful exultation of her Saints,</hi> that <hi>cloathing her enemies with shame,</hi> being expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons properly denoting a state of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal good weal and comfort; and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonance to them require, that we thus likewise understand this phrase; the Priests being also questionless designed to partake in this glorious Felicity of the Church. Which is also confirmed by other Prophecies of the same tenour and intention: as particularly that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. concerning the collection of <hi>Israel,</hi> and redemption of the Spiritual <hi>Sion,</hi> 'tis said, <hi>I will satiate the soul of the Priests with fatness, and my people shall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>be satisfied with my goodness,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="478" facs="tcp:104623:247"/>
Now, although we may adventure safely to interpret the declarations of Divine favour according to the most comprehensive sense of which the words are capable, where they are conceived: (it being the manner of the immensly Good God, to exceed rather, then to be deficient, in the performance of his word; and to surpass the expectations he hath raised in us, then any wise to disappoint them:) yet however, the least we can imagine here promised to the <hi>Priests of Sion,</hi> will comprehend these three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Free and Safe condition of life; that they be not exposed to continual dangers of ruin; of miserable suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or remediless injury: that the benefits of peace, and law, and publick protection, shall particularly appertain to them; so that their adversaries (if any they happen to have) shall not be incited, by hope of reward or impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to hurt their persons, rifle their goods, disturb their quiet; but that they shall enjoy good degrees of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, liberty, and tranquillity in this world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Provision of competent subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence for them: that their condition of
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:104623:247"/>
life be not wholly necessitous, or very penurious, destitute of convenient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations, or depending altogether for them upon the arbitrary benevolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men, which is, at best, but a more plausible kind of beggery; but that they shall be furnished with such reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able supplies, as are requisite to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae them in the chearful performance of their duty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Sutable degree of respect, and so high a station among men, as may commend them to general esteem, and vindicate them from contempt: that they be not reputed among the dregs and refuse of the people; that their persons be not base and despicable, their names made the objects of vulgar oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy, their functions become prostitute to profane irrision; but that some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable authority, some more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary regard and veneration accrue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them from the high relations which they bear, and from the sacred business which they manage.</p>
               <p>All this at least (according to the most moderate interpretation of the phrase) that abundant <hi>Salvation</hi> doth imply, wherewith God hath promised to <hi>invest the Priests of Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="480" facs="tcp:104623:248"/>
We may therefore presume, or rather not presume, but confidently rely upon, and comfort our selves in the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God's faithful continuance to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil this Promise. We may assure our selves, that neither the secret envy of them who repine at those encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which God's Providence hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on his Priests, nor the open ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of those that furiously oppugn their welfare, shall ever prevail to overwhelm them with extream misery, penury, or disgrace; since no endeavour of earth or hell can ever be able to reverse this everlasting decree of Heaven, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat that irresistible power which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to its execution. No inferiour force can strip them naked of that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, wherewith the Supreme Truth hath promised to cloath them.</p>
               <p>Which confidence of ours may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, by considering the Reasons that might induce Almighty God to resolve, and promise thus favourably in behalf of his <hi>Priests.</hi> (For though we cannot penetrate the incomprehensible depths of the Divine Counsel, nor should ever peremptorily conclude concerning the determinate Reasons of his Actions: yet when the wisdom of his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:104623:248"/>
doth clearly approve it self to our understandings, we ought readily to acknowledge it, and humbly to praise him for it.) Now the Reasons why Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence should undertake to preserve the Priesthood in safety, to procure for them liberal maintenance, and to raise them above a state of scorn and infamy, may be especially these three.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It concerns God's Honour.</item>
                  <item>2. The Good of the Church requires so.</item>
                  <item>3. Equity and the reason of the case exacts it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In prosecuting which Heads of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, I shall not seem to you (I hope) to transgress the rules of modesty, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. There be certain seasons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in confessedly it is not only excusable, but expedient also, to commend one's Self; as when a man is falsly accused, or unjustly afflicted. And with greater reason sometime men are allowed to praise the Country where they were born and bred, the Family to which they are allied, the Society to which they are more especially related. And if at this time I assume the like liberty, the occasion (I hope) will apologize for
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:104623:249"/>
me. It becomes not me to be an adviser, much less a reprover, in this Audience: may I therefore, with your favourable permission, presume to be a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or (if you please) a pleader for the welfare of this Sacred Order, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my self an unworthy and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Member thereof. I say therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">I. God's Honour is concerned in the safe, comfortable, and honourable estate of his Priests: and that upon account of those manifold relations, whereby they stand allied, appropriated, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to himself.</p>
               <p>They are in a peculiar manner his Servants. <hi>The servant of the Lord</hi> (saith S. <hi>Paul) must not strive, but be gentle</hi>

Yes; but a Christian Priest, such as <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> was, is by way of excellency so styled. All men owe subjection, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and homage to God: but the Priests are (his <gap reason="foreign">

that are employed in his particular busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And is it then for God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to suffer them to be abused, to want convenient sustenance, to live in a mean and disgraceful condition? Would it not redound to the discredit of an earthly Prince, to permit, that the attendents on his Person, the officers of his Court, the executers of his Edicts should have the least injury offered them, should fare scantly or coursely, should appear in a sordid garb? are they not therefore by especial privileges guarded from such inconveniences? And shall the Great King and Lord of all the world be deemed less provident for, less indulgent (not to say less just) unto his Servants? Servants, I say, and those not of the lowest rank, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the vilest drudgeries; but such as are employed in the most honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable charges, and are entrusted with his most especial concernments.</p>

God's Servant, and in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous addresses immediately to attend on him, must consequently be the most excellent preferment in the World, which is God's Kingdom. And if to supply a man's bodily needs, to restore his liberty, to save his life, be works of generous beneficence: how much more is it so, by good conduct and instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, to adorn their Souls with Vertue, to free them from the bondage of Sin, to rescue them from eternal ruine?</p>
               <p>Our magnanimous Ancestours, who erected as well trophees of their invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible courage abroad, as monuments of their incomparable piety at home, and equally by both did purchase im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal renown to their ingrateful po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, (for not to imitate good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, is the greatest ingratitude,) they, I say, were otherwise disposed; to whose honest Devotion we owe those handsome privileges, and those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent revenues which the Priesthood still enjoys; and which are so maligned by this untoward Age, not less degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in spirit, then corrupt in manners: when all Wisdom, and Vertue, and Religion, are almost in most places
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:104623:256"/>
grown ridiculous: when the serious use of Reason is become (in vulgar opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) the most impertinent and insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant thing in the world: when Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is reputed a meer defect of wit, and weakness of judgment; Integrity, a fond pertinacity of humour; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of mind, and Gravity of demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, a kind of fullen morosity, or uncouth affectation of singularity; and all strict practice of Christian Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currs the imputation of some new-found opprobrious name, one or other. No wonder then, when Religion it self hath so much decayed in its love and esteem, if the Priests, its professed Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, do partake in its fortune. Nor is it to be feared, but that, when the predominant vanities of the Age are somewhat decocted, and men grow weary of their own inconvenient fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; when-ever (not a fierce zeal for some whimsical Model, or some para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxical Opinion, but) a sober esteem of, and a cordial affection to Vertue and genuine Piety do begin to revive in the breasts of men; the love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of the <hi>Clergy</hi> will return. For it will be ever true, what was once said, (though dictated only from the
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:104623:256"/>
reason and experience of a Heathen,) <hi>Qui bonâ fide colit Deos, amat &amp; Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes;</hi>

                  <hi>He that sincerely worships God, will heartily love his Priests.</hi> But not to insist longer on this Reason.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Good of the Church requires, that the Priesthood be well protected, well provided for, and well regarded. That men be converted from iniquity, and induced to the sincere practice of Vertue, is the chief Good of the Church, that to which the Favour of God is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, and upon which the Salvation of Souls doth rely. And this Good mainly depends, partly upon the due execution of the Priestly office, partly upon the fit disposition of the people to comply therewith: and to both those effects the comfortable estate of the Priesthood is conducible and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site. The Priest must be capable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct with advantage; and the people disposed to learn with readiness: He must lead, and they follow chearfully in the paths of righteousness. Which alacrity how can he be Master of, whose mind care and grief, the inseparable companions of a needy estate, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually distract and discompose? whose spirit is dejected with constant regret,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:104623:257"/>
and frequent disappointments? Can he be free and expedite in the discharge of his duty, who is perplexed with the difficulties, and encumbred with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of secular business, (such as the exigencies of a narrow condition do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily induce?) No: few there be, that, with <hi>Epictetus,</hi> can philosophate in slavery; or, like <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> can draw water all the day, and study most of the night.</p>
               <p>The Priests are bound, (for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of truth and right, and for the reclaiming of men from errour and sin, that is, for the most important good of the Church,) as the Apostles are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten related to have done, <gap reason="foreign">

what efficacy their most pathetical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations obtain? what passion their faint breath raise in mens benummed hearts? No more, certainly, then their mean condition shall procure among men either of friendship or esteem.</p>
               <p>We see therefore how Almighty God, that he might conciliate credit unto, and infuse a persuasive energy into the words of his Prophets and Apostles, was pleased to dignifie them with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts of foretelling future events, and doing miraculous works: their Doctrine, it seems, (though of it self most reasonable and plausible,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not sufficient to convince the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, without some remarkable excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in the Teachers, challenging the people's awful regard, and exciting their attention. Otherwise how piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully-scant a draught those poor fishers of men had caught by the common al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements only of innocent life, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional discourse, I leave you to imagine. And where such extraordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations are wanting, is it not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable that the need of them should be supplied by ordinary and probable expedients?</p>
               <p>I might further add, how a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous

and despicable estate doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly not onely disturb the mindes, and deject the spirits of men; but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempereth also their Souls, and viciateth their manners; rendring them not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sad and anxious, slavish and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but greedy also and covetous, peevish and mutinous, rude and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: engages them in sordid company, and tempts them to unworthy courses. From which one cause, how scandalous effects, and how prejudicial to the Churche's both honour and safety, have proceeded, I need not for to say, since wofull experience too loudly proclaims it.</p>
               <p>I might adde more-over, that the Priests do confer to the good of the State; which is secured and advanced by the sincere instruction of men in duties of Obedience, Justice, and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and by maintenance of good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science among men. So that if things be rightly considered, it will be hard to find a better Commonwealths-man, then a good Minister.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore the good of the Church, upon various accounts, is so much concerned in the Priests encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, welfare, and respect; 'tis very

Those qualities, I say, which result from a liberal, a sober, a modest Education, in the Schools of Wisedom, and under the influences of good Discipline.

               <p>But further yet, abstracting from both their personal worth, and the merit of their service, consider their Condition in this world, and see whether it doth not in equity challenge some reasonable provision to be made for them. Are they not, by the nature of their profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, secluded from all ordinary means of temporal advancement? Be not those usual inlets of Wealth, the Court, the Camp, and the Exchange, shut upon them, yea barr'd against them, by those insuperable obstacles of Law and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom? Can they grow rich by Trade, or famous by feats of Arms? May they plead for others? 'tis well if they be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to do it for themselves before equal judges. Yet are they not Men, endued with humane passions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments? Are they not Citizens, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in the common interests of the weal publick? Are they not sensible of the inconveniencies, and capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:104623:264"/>
the benefits of this life? Are they not equally obliged, and would they not be glad, as well as others, to be in a capacity to requite courtesies, to help relations, to gratifie friends, to relieve the poor, to express respectively their humanity, and their gratitude? Skill they not to use the goods of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune (or rather the gifts of Providence) with as much discretion, as much sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, as much honour, as others? Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare things righteously, and let Reason judge; let Experience be examined; let those eternal monuments of their Piety, their Charity, their Hospitality, declare and testifie. Shall, lastly, the fruits of painful study, the improvement of hopeful parts, the flower of vigorous age and strength spent in the publick service, tend only hither, to put a man into a state of struggling with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream contempt and penury? If this be not, what, I pray you, is monstrous iniquity?</p>
               <p>Since therefore it appears (upon so many several scores) reasonable, that Almighty God should undertake the protection, and assert the honour of his Priests; we may not only praise the
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:104623:264"/>
goodness, but approve also the wisdom of this promise; and by the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof strengthen our Faith in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance thereon. To which purpose one Consideration more may very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and withal may provoke our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to celebrate his truth and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, in making good, as well as his goodness and wisdom, in making this Promise; <hi>viz.</hi> the considering how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually hitherto God hath been pleased effectually to <hi>cloath</hi> his <hi>Priests with Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> to provide abundantly for their safety, their accommodation, their respect in this World; and to deliver them from the opposite inconveniences.</p>
               <p>If we reflect our thoughts on the first Ages of Christianity, (not more dismal for Suffering, then glorious for Piety,) 'tis admirable to see how sincerely and passionately the Christian People did then love their Priests and Pastors; how liberally, out of their slender stock, and the shipwrecks of their spoiled for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, they contributed to their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; what exceeding veneration they bore them; with what incredible alacrity they submitted to the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere disciplines injoined by them; how willingly they followed them, though
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:104623:265"/>
leading into the jaws of death and cruel torture: so that, although it was then necessary for the Christian Priests to undergo the greatest hardships, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the design of Christian Religion; (which was to be propagated, not by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Power, nor by politick Artifice, but by the invincible Faith, Resolution and Patience of the Professors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers thereof;) yet never more may they have seemed to thrive and prosper, then in that juncture of time, when they enjoyed the universal good-will and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of good people, when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constrainedly embraced affliction for righteousness-sake, and acquired there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the certain fruition of a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Salvation.</p>
               <p>But in the succeeding Times, when Christianity, breaking out of the clouds of Persecution, began to shine over all with brightest lustre; of the glories and happy fruits of that illustrious triumph none did partake more fully, than they, who had sustained the hardest brunts of the foregoing conflict, and had been the principal causes of the success. Then the joyful acclamations of the faithful People resounded in the praise of their victorious Champions: Then did the
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:104623:265"/>
Emperors themselves, with arms out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stretched, and hearts enlarged, with affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion embrace the Authors of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Conversion; then all Laws prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to their welfare were rescined, and new ones were substituted, abundantly providing for their security, honest live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, and due reverence; which in progress of time, not in the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire onely, but in all other Nations (that afterward did entertain Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity) were no-wise impaired, but were rather ampliated and fortified by the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous favour of Princes: The barbarous <hi>Goths,</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> being no sooner endued with any degree of Civility, or any sense of Religion, then possessed with a hearty reverence of their Bishops, and Priests.</p>
               <p>And ever since, (which is not to be imputed, as some rashly, if not impiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly, averr, to the prevalence of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian iniquity, but rather to the Providence of Divine Benignity; ever since, I say) till the late Commotions and Alterations in Christendom, they have been the Guardians of others safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not themselves deprived of protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; have abounded with Wealth, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than wanted sustenance; have been
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:104623:266"/>
the objects of Envy, more than of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Princes have loved and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished them, have relied upon their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and entrusted them with their highest concernments. Nobles have not been asham'd to yield them place. The Sacerdotal Robe hath been often dyed with Purple; and the Sons of mighty Monarchs have not thought themselves degraded by entring into their Order. And if in some particular places (before or since those Changes) their condition hath not been so high and plentiful; yet hath it been (almost ever) tolerable; the countenance of Authority, and the respect of the People being in good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree vouchsafed them. Even in those Churches which till this day groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the oppression of Infidel Princes; the Priests (by the free permission of those Princes) retain their Jurisdiction in a manner as great as ever; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al enjoy a maintenance not altogether inconsiderable.</p>
               <p>So favourable hitherto hath God been unto his Priests, so faithful to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: which doth oblige us to thank him; which may encourage us to hope in him; which may arm us with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence against the present ill will of those
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:104623:266"/>
that wish, and against the practices of those that design our ruin.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, This Promise is not affixed to all parts of time, to all particularities of place, to all determinate circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of things. The Priests may now and then, here and there, in this or that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer highly; they may be ejected, be plundred, be degraded, as experience hath shewed us. But they may be also soon restored, re-possessed, re-advanced, and (I had almost said) revenged too; as the like experience doth assure us. 'Tis not impossible, I confess, we may relapse into the same, or into a more calamitous estate; the obstinate disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Men threaten it, and our own miscarriages more dangerously: yet the most offensive of these (which many honest Men dislike, and most Men exclaim against) have been in as bitter terms complained of in almost the first Ages. <q>

God did continue to vouchsafe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to them. They were sometimes, (by the inundations of barbarous Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,) and we may again (by national concussions) be severely chastised for our Faults: Yet were not they, nor shall we be (at least every-where, and for ever) utterly rejected.

                  <hi>our Iniquity with Stripes: Nevertheless his loving-kindness will he not utterly take from us, nor suffer his faithfulness to fail. His Covenant he will not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of his lips.</hi> God may for a time hide his Face from us; but he will not for ever turn his Back upon us: The honour of the Priesthood may for a while be overclouded in some part of the World; but shall never to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally be eclipsed, nor swallowed up in a perpetual Night. While God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues his Residence in <hi>Sion,</hi> and defends his Church against <hi>the gates of Hell,</hi> and <hi>powers of Darkness;</hi> while Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains any sway in the Hearts of Men, and Truth possesses any room upon Earth; the Priests shall not be left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute and naked, but everlastingly be <hi>cloathed with Salvation.</hi> Which that it may (to the Glory of God, and Good

of his Church) more surely come to pass, let us convert this Promise into a Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and say with <hi>Solomon, Now therefore arise, O Lord God, thou and the Ark of</hi>
