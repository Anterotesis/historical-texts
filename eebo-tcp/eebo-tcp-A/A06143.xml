            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:9244:3"/>
               <hi>consilium.</hi> The kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> when they admitted any into councell, tooke their fignet, &amp; laid it on their mouths, as a seale of sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, saying, <hi>Anima co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>silij secretu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;</hi> so <hi>Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> did to his councellor <hi>Ephestio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could any be of councel in <hi>Persia,</hi> but such as were in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell most secret, &amp; in gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t most wise &amp; prudent. The cause why <hi>Demosthenes</hi> was so esteemed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ng the Athenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, was his wisdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; policie often to preuent the force &amp; stratagems of <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Macedon.</hi> The cause why <hi>Vlixes</hi> was iudged more worthy of <hi>Achilles</hi> armor then <hi>Aiax,</hi> was his experience and councell to <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in the Grecian warres. So it may be well spoken of <hi>Nestor,</hi> who was preferred before all other Greeke Captaines, for the like cause, <hi>Multitudo enim sapientu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sanitas orbis terraru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est,</hi> saith wisdom.

But no councell, no policie against the Lord, no wisdom nor Stratagem to ouerthrow a king or a kingdom, but the sins of the king &amp; the kingdome.

Which if the Hebrewes had so acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it, and had marched truly and faithfully in the Lords battels, they should haue acknowledged this to haue bin their true Oracle, that all victories come from the Lord, and not from the arme of man.

               <p>But they forgot the great armies and legions of Frogges, Flies, Grashoppers, and such armies which the Lord prouided to fight for them, while yet they were bondmen in <hi>Egipt,</hi> where they had ten victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ten tryumphs, some in the midst of the land of <hi>Egipt,</hi> some in the midst of the Court of <hi>Pharao;</hi> and some in the midst of the red sea, to the wonder, and terrour of the whole world.

               <p>Yet all these miraculous victories, which the Lorde gaue the Hebrewes ouer so many Kings and Countries, could not make them to acknowledge the author thereof, but what victories soeuer the good kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> got by seruing of the Lord, that the euil &amp; wicked Kings both of <hi>Iuda</hi> &amp; <hi>Israel</hi> lost by their Idolatry and contempt of the Lord, vntill they themselues were rooted out of their Countrey, slain and ouerthrowne, and their Kings taken &amp; carried captiues, the one by <hi>Salmanasser</hi> to the Assirians, the other by <hi>Nabuchodonozer</hi> into <hi>Babilon,</hi> of whom you shall reade more, of them and of their warres here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In these kinde of battels or combats, euery man must be armed with such spirituall weapons, as is by <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle appointed, to resist the violence of so great an enemy, who doth not only assault vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, but in our chambers, yea in our beds, we must therefore wrestle with this enemy as <hi>Iacob</hi> wrestled with the Angell, for the which he was named <hi>Israel:</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> wrestled with Sathan, for the which the Lord called him his seruant <hi>Iob:</hi> Or as <hi>Dauid</hi> did with the Gyant <hi>Goliah,</hi> for the which he was annointed King of <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In these kinde of combats the Prophets &amp; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of the Lorde win many victories of Sathan and his souldiers, as <hi>Esay</hi> that was sawed in peeces by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses</hi> in <hi>Ierusalem, Ieremy</hi> that was stoned to death at <hi>Taphnis</hi> in <hi>Egipt</hi> by the people: <hi>Ezechiel</hi> whose brains were beaten out in <hi>Babilon,</hi> and infinite numbers of the Martyrs of the Lord, which fought in these bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels of the Lord with legions of diuels, and armies of spirits, and got glorious victories, and were crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not with the Oliue of <hi>Olimpia,</hi> nor with the Lawrell of the Romanes, but with Crownes and Garlandes made of the tree of knowledge, and of

the tree of life, crownes of immortalitie, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of eternitie.</p>
               <p>These might say with <hi>Paul,</hi> We haue runne a good race, and fought good combattes, farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter combattes then <hi>Romulus</hi> had with <hi>Acron,</hi> and yet it was for two kingdoms: greater then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had with his brother <hi>Cyrus</hi> for the great kingdome and Empire of <hi>Persia,</hi> or the combattes betweene <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Aiax,</hi> where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Kings and kingdomes were ouerthrowne: but the only combat which makes euery souldier stout and valiant, was by the seede of the woman who rescued <hi>Adam</hi> from the bondes of Sathan, and <note place="margin">Adam rescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the seed of the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> restored him to libertie, and wanne a greater vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to <hi>Adam,</hi> then <hi>Adam</hi> had lost to Sathan: this is the strong armed man that is spoken of in the Gospell of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> that did binde Sathan and <note place="margin">Luke. 11.</note> tooke his rich spoyle out of his clawes, restored to <hi>Adam</hi> his life and libertie, with a condition to stand out and resist Sathan, and to fight stoutly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Sathan in these combattes and battailes of the Lorde, for <hi>Adam</hi> was first a murtherer of his children, before he had children, and <hi>Adam</hi> was the cause that Christ was slaine for him, thereby to saue him and his children.</p>
               <p>Vnder this strong armed Captaine, all men must march armed to fight the Lordes battaile, as <hi>Elias</hi> did, who marched himselfe against 450. false Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> in combat of life &amp; death, whom hee ouercame and slue for theyr Idolatry, at the brooke <hi>Kyson.</hi>

               <p>So hee marked the Hebrewes in the land of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,</hi> to be saued from the plagues in <hi>Egipt,</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell also was commaunded of the Lord to marke the doore postes of the houses in <hi>Egipt</hi> with the sprinkling of the bloud of a lambe, as a mark to spare his people.</p>
               <p>So the Lord commaunded his Angels to goe <note place="margin">They that mourned in Ierusalem were marked with the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Tau.</note> through the whole Cittie of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that those that wept and lamented for <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> should bee marked in theyr foreheads with the letter <hi>Tau.</hi>

The Lord also charged those Angels that had power to hurt the earth and the sea, not to hurt the earth vntill the seruants of the Lord were sealed and marked in their foreheads.</p>

                  <hi>Paul</hi> as himself said, bare the markes of the Lord <note place="margin">Pauls marke.</note> Iesus in his body, opposing the markes of those stripes which hee bare for his maister Christ, as a mark of his Apostleship against the outward circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of the Iewes, these were externall markes by the Prophets set downe in the olde Testament, but in the new Testament, the seruants of the Lord were marked, with the bloud of the Lambe Christ Iesus, a true marke of our saluation.</p>

               <p>The wicked also haue their inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward markes: <hi>Cain</hi> had his marke, not outwardly seene by men, but inwardly so felt of <hi>Cain,</hi> that hee <note place="margin">Cains mark.</note> oft did wish to die, and could not, for that was his marke, that whosoeuer kild <hi>Cain</hi> should bee seuen folde punished.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Esau</hi> had also his marke, and such a marke, that all the Edomites that came of him had also <hi>Esaus</hi> mark, <note place="margin">Esaus marke</note> whose marke was that hee could not repent though he sought it with teares.</p>
               <p>So had the false Prophets their markes, as the messengers of Sathan, to speake lies to the people: and so Heretiques had their marks, for blaspheming the name of the Lord, denying one article or other of our faith.</p>

The Thracians were marked in their foreheades, whereof they were so proud, and reioyced so much of these markes to terrifie their enemies, like the old Britaines who painted themselues, that they might seeme terrible in their warres. Of these markes of souldiers I shall haue occasion to speake of, when I entreat of military discipline to souldiers, omitting now further to speake of letters written in seruaunts foreheads, of rings on bondmens feete, and haires of the head halfe shaued.

               <p>As the Syracusans burned their seruants in the forehead with the print of a horse, to be knowne as bondmen, so the Sameans burned the Athenian souldiers taken captiue in the warres, in the forhead with the print of an Owle.

               <p>This was a battell of the Lord, that <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a priuate man with his houshold seruants o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrew foure of the greatest kings of <hi>Asia,</hi> for in these battels of the Lord numbers are not respected.

               <p>And at that time that <hi>Nabuchodonozer</hi> raigned in <hi>Babilon,</hi> a thousand yeares after <hi>Ninus, Baal</hi> was so reuerenced and honored in <hi>Babilon,</hi> that if any man should speake words against <hi>Baal,</hi> or not kneele to

Thus euery victorie had his triumph, and euerie triumph was solemnized without either a stroak giuen, or a sword drawne, but with a white rod in <hi>Moses</hi> hand, so that it seemed rather a combat betweeene <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Pharao,</hi> then a set battell betweene the Hebrewes and the Egiptians.</p>
               <p>The third persecution vnder <hi>Traiane</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> in all points is to be likened to the third plague vnder <hi>Pharao</hi>

               <p>For if the Egiptians had obserued how the Hebrews in the land of <hi>Gosen,</hi> had neuer heard, or seene, or felt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny plague, being in one Countrey, and at one time, nor so much as a dogge among the Hebrewes miscarried, or if the Romanes had but considered the workes of the Lord, how hee encreased the Christians to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the slaughters of the persecutions, and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened the Christians to conquer the crueltie of these Tyrants, that as the Hebrews multiplied in <hi>Egipt</hi> to the ouerthrow of <hi>Egipt,</hi> in spite of <hi>Pharaos</hi> killing &amp; drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: so the Christians multiplyed in all the Romane Empire, for all theyr slaughter and destroying of the Christians.</p>
               <p>But no amendment appeared in <hi>Pharao</hi> by the three former plagues, then marcheth <hi>Moses</hi> forward with his fourth Army, commaunding with one mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage still; thus saith the Lorde, Let my people goe, <note place="margin">The fourth plague.</note> or else to bee afflicted with the fourth plague, with the like simple Army of souldiers, as before in the second and the third, for great swarmes of flyes came into the Court of <hi>Pharao,</hi> and into all the lande of <hi>Egipt,</hi> so that all <hi>Egipt</hi> was corrupted by this infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite multitude of flyes, but in the lande of <hi>Gosen,</hi>

(to the great wonder of <hi>Pharao</hi> and his people) were none of these souldiers seene: for the Lord had sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the lande of <hi>Gosen</hi> where his people the Hebrewes dwelt, that they should not bee touched either with Frogs, Flies, or Lice. <hi>Pharao,</hi> and all his kingdome of <hi>Egipt,</hi> man and beast, were so bitten and infected with these swarmes of Flies, and wearied with these souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <note place="margin">The fourth yeelding of Pharao to Moses.</note> that <hi>Pharao</hi> againe yeelded to <hi>Moses,</hi> and requested <hi>Moses</hi> to do sacrifice for him vnto the Lord, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Moses</hi> that <hi>Israel</hi> should goe out of <hi>Egipt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithstanding he kept no promise, but still har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened his heart, and prouoked the Lord to plague him, his court, and his kingdome.

But no plague, no calamitie, could moue <hi>Pharao</hi> to yeeld obedience to the lord, neither acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his name, but still saying <hi>Nescio dominum,</hi> but by meanes made to <hi>Moses</hi> to remooue these plagues from him, yeelding euer the victory to <hi>Moses,</hi> but neuer yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his heart to the Lord.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Antioch,</hi> in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in <hi>Caesaria,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where else where the Romanes had any gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Iewes were giuen to be deuoured of wild and fierce beasts, as Lyons, Elephants, and Tygres, and to <note place="margin">The fourth persecution.</note> fight vpon publike theaters to solemnize the tryumphs of <hi>Vespasian</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus.</hi> And therefore were the Hebrues well compared to the Christians, for their manifolde plagues and miseries, and the Egiptians to the Romains for their tyrannie. Yet the Hebrewes had some oddes <note place="margin">The fighting of the Iewes with wilde beasts.</note> more then the Christians had, for they might fight on publike shewes &amp; vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theaters, with Lyons, Elephants, and wild beasts, which <hi>Titus</hi> sent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

to beautifie his father <hi>Vespasians</hi> triumph to the number of 16000. Iewes: but the Christians with present death, with all the tortures that could be inuented, executed vpon them.</p>
               <p>I may not forget <hi>Pharao</hi> in <hi>Egipt,</hi> for his well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued plagues, the violence whereof he could not resist, nor defend himselfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these armies in his priuy cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. For that it was the Lords battell, as <hi>Iamnes</hi> and <hi>Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,</hi> and the charmes of <hi>Egipt</hi> before did confesse.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Nabuchodonozer</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed, after he was taken from <note place="margin">The yeelding of tyrants.</note> the throne of his kingdome in <hi>Babilon,</hi> to liue among beasts in the field.</p>

               <p>Thus not only the Emperors of <hi>Rome</hi> tyrannized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christians, but also the kings of <hi>Syria,</hi> little inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the Romans in tyrannie, against whom the Lord did not only stirre men, but women &amp; children to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne their threatnings, and to despise their crueltie, as <hi>Antiochus</hi> king of <hi>Syria</hi> commanded caudrons &amp; brazen pots to be heated, straitly charging that he that spake but a word with <hi>Moses</hi> law, should haue his tongue cut out: this could not terrifie a woman with her seuen sonnes, who one after another, denied the eating &amp; sacrificing of swines flesh, the defiling of their temple with Images, refusing to forsake the lawes of <hi>Moses,</hi> and in this to liue and die.</p>

               <p>AMd <hi>Moses</hi> was sent with his seuenth message to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao,</hi> saying; How long will it be before thou submit thy self to me, saith the Lord?

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:9244:23"/>
both man &amp; beast, the thunder, the raine, the haile and the fire mingled together, so hurtfull, and so gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, as there was not the like in <hi>Egipt,</hi> since it was a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and yet the land of <hi>Gosen</hi> where the Hebrues dwelt neither hard thunders, nor saw fire, lightnings nor rain.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Pharao</hi> stil against his promise, staied the Hebrues in extreame bondage in <hi>Egipt,</hi> and yet with terrour and feare of the punishments, requested <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to cease the horrible thunders, and fierie lightnings, which being ceased, <hi>Pharao</hi> ceased not to sinne vpon sin, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gaue he himselfe to seeke the Lord, for all the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of so many plagues past.</p>
               <p>The Macedonians at any Eclipse of the Moone wold be so frighted and terrified, though the naturall cause were opened vnto them of the defects thereof by many <note place="margin">Liui. 35.</note> of their Captaines, yet would they not but against their will, at the Eclipse time enter into battell.</p>
               <p>So the old Romanes were so amazed that they tooke the ebbing &amp; flowing of the sea, to be wrought by some <note place="margin">Q. Curtius lib. 4.</note> diuine power of the gods.

               <p>The Lacedemonians by <hi>Lycurgus</hi> lawe would not admit any straunger to stay in <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> In <hi>Athens Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles</hi>

               <p>Likewise the Carthagineans could not abide stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, for those that sailed into <hi>Sardinia</hi> or to <hi>Hercules</hi> pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, escaped hardly the Carthagineans handes, for that they would suffer no straunger to dwell in their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories.</p>
               <p>So also in <hi>India</hi> no stranger might stay among them past three daies, so straight were strangers looked vnto in all Countries, that the Romanes would not admit any mercenarie souldier being a stranger in their warres.</p>
               <p>The Hebrewes suffered no stranger to dwel among them, to vse forraine religion, &amp; therfore it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the Samaritans to come to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> nor for the Samaritans to conuerse themselues with the Iewes.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Pharao</hi> against the lawes and customes of all countries, and against the lawe of his owne country, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted strangers, his owne enemies to dwell in <hi>Egipt.

               <p>How fitly this eight Egiptian plague, resembleth the eight Romane persecution vnder the Emperor <hi>Valeria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oses</hi> is sent from the Lord to <hi>Pharao,</hi> and commanded to hold out his hand vnto heauen, that there was darknesse <note place="margin">The ninth plague.</note> vpon all the land of <hi>Egipt,</hi> &amp; such pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable darknesse, that neither fire, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, torch, or any light, might giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> light, it was such palpable darknesse that the Egiptians might feele it, and this darknesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued three daies long, that one might not see an other. Yet <hi>Pharaos</hi> heart was so hardned, that now in his furie and rage, he commaunds <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to goe out of <note place="margin">The dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao.</note> his sight, threatning them with death if they came any more before him, though in the last plague he requested <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to pray for him, and to forgiue him his sinnes, but then were his words full of dissimulation, and his repentance full of hypocrisie: hee could say, I haue sinned, but he could not say, I haue repented, and beforie for his sinnes.</p>
               <p>The ninth persecution vnder <hi>Aurelianus</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> may throughly bee likened to the ninth plague vnder <note place="margin">The ninth persecution.</note> 
                  <hi>Pharao</hi> in <hi>Egipt.</hi> The like threatnings of speech, and the like words that <hi>Pharao</hi> vsed to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in <hi>Egipt,</hi> the like vsed <hi>Aurelianus</hi> against the Christians in <hi>Rome:</hi> but it contiued not long, for he was slaine as others his predecessors were. And as for the great palpable dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in <hi>Egipt,</hi> so was it in <hi>Rome,</hi> when their minde was more darke then darknesse it selfe. The Egiptians hated not the Hebrews so much, as the Romanes hated the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9244:25"/>
Christians. For <hi>Pilate</hi> the Romane preside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which gaue sentence on Christ to die, and sawe many myracles done by him, sent Letters to his maister <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the Emperor, and to the Senators, recyting the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles <note place="margin">Christ deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Romanes.</note> that Christ had done before he died, saying hee was worthy to bee canonized &amp; placed among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane goddes, which all the Senators with one consent denied, though <hi>Caesar</hi> requested them first, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them after, yet Christ was not allowed to be a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tiberius</hi> without effect of his good motion died, &amp; so did that wicked Emperor <hi>Aurelianus,</hi> in the midst of his cruel persecutions. After who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> succeeded a good valiant Emperor <hi>Flam. Claudius,</hi> &amp; so valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that he vanquished the Gothes; the Illyrians, and Macedonians, whereby in <hi>Rome</hi> he was so honoured, that the Senators sent to him <note place="margin">A golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get sent by the Senators.</note> a golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Target, which afterward was set vp in the shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, and a golden statue to stand in the Capitoll, but he died too timely of a sicknesse at <hi>Sirmium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After him succeeded his brother <hi>Aurel. Quintilius,</hi> a good moderate Emperour, equall, or rather to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before his brother, but he was slaine within 18. daies after hee was elected Emperour by the souldiers. These good Emperors onely I name, for that persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were euer executed by cruel Kings and Emperors.</p>
               <p>But these cruell Emperours, as they cruelly destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">The euill end of cruel Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours.</note> others, so cruelly were they destroyed after: as some of them were killed by theyr owne handes, as <hi>Nero,</hi> some murthered by their owne seruants, as <hi>Domitianus,</hi> some suddenly slaine riding by the high way, as <hi>Decius,</hi> some banished died in straunge Countreys, as <hi>Seuerus:</hi> others died captiues in bondage and slauerie, as <hi>Valeria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> did in <hi>Persia:</hi> others eaten with cankers &amp; wormes,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:9244:26"/>
as <hi>Maximinius,</hi> others murthered one after an other, as <hi>Aurel. Tacit.</hi> and <hi>Florianus.</hi> Thus were those Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours slaine and murthered that cruelly persecuted the Christians.</p>
               <p>The Lorde beeing determined now to finish his plague in <hi>Egipt,</hi> and to bring his people away, willed <note place="margin">The tenth plague.</note> euery man and euery woman to borrow of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Iewels of gold and siluer, for <hi>Moses</hi> was verie great in the land of <hi>Egipt,</hi> with <hi>Pharao,</hi> and with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for before this, <hi>Pharao</hi> had appointed <hi>Moses</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Egiptians, against the king of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> which I wrote in the Historie of <hi>Moses.</hi> Yet said the Lord, I will bring one plague more vpon <hi>Pharao,</hi> and vpon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt,</hi> and after that he will let you goe hence, for all the first borne of the land of <hi>Egipt</hi> shall die, euen from the first borne of <hi>Pharao</hi> that sitteth on his seate, vntill the first borne of the maide seruant that sitteth in the mill.</p>
               <p>The Lord knew at that time how to saue the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes in <hi>Gosen</hi> from all the plagues in <hi>Egipt,</hi> and to <note place="margin">The Lord useth all things by meanes.</note> saue <hi>Noah</hi> from the geneall deluge in the Arke, to saue <hi>Lot</hi> from fire and brimstone in <hi>Zodome,</hi> and to saue the Christians from the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in <hi>Pella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As this tenth plague was the greatest, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiest, so the tenth persecution was the greatest, and the <note place="margin">The tenth persecution.</note> longest, vnder <hi>Dioclesian</hi> in the East parts; and vnder <hi>Maximianus</hi> in the West, either of them persecuting and afflicting with such slaughters of martyred Christians, that for the space of tenne yeares, for so long continued the tenth persecution, there was nothing but the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bloudie persecution, sword and fire, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of both these Emperours with most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie to bee executed, and as vnder <hi>Nero</hi> the first persecution began, so vnder <hi>Dioclesian</hi> it ended. For the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9244:26"/>
Church of God so flourished, the Christians so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, and the godly martyrs so multiplyed, that these tyrants were wearie to persecute them any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>At that very time, when persecution ended vnder <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> then heresie began to spring vnder Sathan: <note place="margin">When perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ended, heresie bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> for when one stratagem of Sathan faileth, he practiseth an other.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Arius</hi> marcheth with his <hi>Antitrinitary</hi> crew, and set themselues in battell against the Lord, with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and blasphemous weapons, and as the Poets faine, the Gyants set themselues in battell against the Sun, the <note place="margin">Arrius the first of his sect.</note> Moone, and the Stars, so this crew of heretikes set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to fight against God the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, some denying Christ by nature to bee Cod, but onely of accidentall participation of diuine properties as <hi>Arius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some affirming that Christ tooke his beginning of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> denying the diuine nature of Christ, as <hi>Samosatenus</hi> and <hi>Photinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others imagined that Christ had not a true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as the Marcionites <note place="margin">Euseb. in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his bookes espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the fourth at large, writes of these mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Saturninus.</note> and Manichees.</p>
               <p>The Ebionites affirmed Christ to be naturally born of a woman gotten by man. I will omit to speake of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and his disciple <hi>Menander,</hi> of <hi>Cerdon,</hi> and his disciple <hi>Marcion,</hi> and of <hi>Saturninus,</hi> and a number more of this crewe, who denie one Article or other of our Christian faith, confounding the diuine nature of the Trinitie. These heretikes possessing diuers seates, as <hi>Arius</hi> in <hi>Alexandria, Saturninus</hi> in <hi>Antioch, Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> in <hi>Lions,</hi> and so of the rest, which beeing the verie blast and breath of Sathan, haue brought into
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9244:27"/>
their heresie many kings and princes of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> but all these heretikes were by generall councell confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and condemned.</p>
               <p>The Nicene councell condemned <hi>Arius</hi> and his partners which denied the deitie and diuine nature of Christ, this councell held vnder the Emperour <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> where 318. Bishops met together to confute <hi>Arius</hi> and his heresie.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:9244:27"/>
plagues, before he would let the Hebrewes goe out of <hi>Egipt,</hi> vntill hee was brideled and hooked by the nosthrils as <hi>Senacharib</hi> was, and compelled to let the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes goe. Yet <hi>Pharao</hi> with his wonted hardened heart, with all the power and force of <hi>Egipt</hi> followed <note place="margin">The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao after the Hebrewes.</note> after, beeing two hundreth thousand footemen, fiftie thousand horsemen, sixe hundreth chosen chariots of the kings owne army, a sufficient armie against weapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and vnarmed men. Notwithstanding he had infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of footemen, horsemen, and chariots, out of all parts of <hi>Egipt,</hi> assuring himselfe, by this multitude he would make a full end of the Hebrewes, hauing this aduantage, the sea being before the Hebrues, the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines on either side them, and <hi>Pharao</hi> with all the force of <hi>Egipt</hi> at their back, a narrower straight as <hi>Pharao</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, then the Greeks had against the Persians at <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mopyla,</hi> and there <hi>Pharao</hi> thought to ende his long desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red tyrannie vpon the Hebrewes.</p>
               <p>It was to be wondred that after ten great victories in <hi>Egipt,</hi> gotten against <hi>Pharao,</hi> by no other weapon then with a rod in <hi>Moses</hi> hand, durst not looke <hi>Moses</hi> in the face, &amp; after these victories in <hi>Egipt,</hi> durst follow <hi>Moses,</hi> hauing sixe hundred thousand Hebrewes marching in his campe, this was the time appointed of the Lord to do with <hi>Pharao</hi> that which <hi>Pharao</hi> thought to do to the Hebrewes, for the Lord commaunded <hi>Moses</hi> to hold vp his rod, and to stretch out his hand vpon the sea, and to <note place="margin">A stratagem of the Lord.</note> diuide the seas, to let the Hebrues goe through on drie ground, and to suffer the Egiptians to follow after, vntil the Lord commaunded <hi>Moses</hi> againe to stretch out his hand vpon the sea, (a diuine straragem of the Lord) to <note place="margin">The drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao in the red sea.</note> let the waters turnevpon the Egiptians &amp; ouerwhelme them. So the Lord by water saued the Hebrewes his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:9244:28"/>
people, and by water drowned the Egiptians his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Appian</hi> most impudently affirmed <hi>Moses</hi> to haue done what hee did by Magicke, whom the common people in <hi>Egipt</hi> named <hi>Tisithes,</hi> and <hi>Ioshuah Peresephes. Appian</hi> alleageth <hi>Manetho</hi> and <hi>Cheremon</hi> two Egiptian <note place="margin">Appins im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent lies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Moses</note> writers, to proue his fond assertions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> also held that opinion that <hi>Moses</hi> was a great Magician, and did many miracles in <hi>Egipt</hi> through Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, yet it is more lawfull for <hi>Pliny</hi> that wrote of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges, to lie in some thinges, then for <hi>Manetho</hi> a poore schoole-maister in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or for <hi>Cheremon,</hi> two fabulous writers of the Egiptian history onely.</p>
               <p>The best Magician that helped himselfe at need, was <hi>Appollonius Thianeus,</hi> who beeing accused of capitall crimes before <hi>Domitianus</hi> the Emperour, being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Appolonius Thianeus.</note> by the Emperour what helpe hee could do now to himselfe by his Magick, nothing said he but this, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished <note place="margin">This storie is reported o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise in the life of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius.</note> away out of the Emperours sight, so much could not <hi>Iamnes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> do to saue themselues from the botches &amp; blaines, which as they say was done by <hi>Moses</hi> Magicke in <hi>Egipt.</hi> And therefore I thinke it best to set downe the true history of <hi>Moses,</hi> before yet he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Lord to leade the Hebrewes out of the lande of <hi>Egipt</hi> into <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> the sonne of <hi>Amri,</hi> was of the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> and the seuenth from <hi>Abraham</hi> borne in <hi>Egipt,</hi> brought vp by <hi>Thermutes</hi> king <hi>Pharaos</hi> daughter and heire, in this childe <hi>Moses</hi> shee delighted so much, being brought vp in all the learning and knowledge of the Egiptians, that <hi>Moses</hi> pleased <hi>Thermutes</hi> so well, that she moued her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hauing no male childe but her selfe, that it might please the king to make <hi>Moses</hi> her adopted sonne, least
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9244:28"/>
                  <hi>Thermutes</hi> also should be barren, and want an heire to possesse the crowne. This being agreed vpon betweene <hi>Pharao</hi> and his daughter, <hi>Moses</hi> grew great in <hi>Egipt,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Moses in Egipt.</note> fauoured and well beloued amongst all the Aegipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
               <p>It happened at that time that the Aethiopians had warre with the king of <hi>Egipt,</hi> hauing wonne two great victories ouer the Egiptians, spoyled and wasted <hi>Egipt</hi> vnto the verie citie of <hi>Memphis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Priests of <hi>Egipt</hi> being instructed by the Oracles of <hi>Ammon</hi> to choose an Hebrew captaine, to lead their armie against the Aethiopians, the king being informed <note place="margin">Moses cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen captaine for Pharao.</note> of this Oracle, spake faire to his daughter <hi>Thermuthes</hi> through the perswasion of the Priests, who vsed the like pollicie to haue <hi>Moses</hi> slaine among the Aethiopians, as <note place="margin">Ioseph. lib. 2. cap. 5. de an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq.

                  <hi>Saul</hi> vsed to haue <hi>Dauid</hi> slaine among the Philistines, <hi>Thermutes</hi> perceiuing the daunger of her fathers king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which fell vnto her by succession, would knowe of <hi>Moses</hi> secretly his minde therein, <hi>Moses</hi> being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with contented, the kings daughter brought <hi>Moses</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her father and the Priests, to whom <hi>Thermutes</hi> in this sort spake: Is <hi>Moyses</hi> the man whome before this time you founde by Oracles, shoulde destroy <hi>Egipt,</hi> and now you finde by the same Oracles, to haue that man to be your captaine to saue <hi>Egipt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Priests forgat not when <hi>Thermutes</hi> laide the diademe vpon the childes head, which <hi>Moses</hi> being but <note place="margin">Moses death sought by the Priests of Egipt.</note> a very childe, with both his handes tooke the diademe from his head and threw it to the ground, and treaded it vnder his feete; whereat the Priestes of <hi>Egipt</hi> were so astonished, that they told the king, that that childe shoulde bee the ouerthrow and destruction of <hi>Egipt,</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:9244:29"/>
they all counselled <hi>Pharao</hi> to take away the feare of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt,</hi> and the hope of the Hebrewes.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding <hi>Moses,</hi> as he was by the prouidence of God preserued, saued from killing &amp; drowning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a childe, so likewise then was he kept from the enuy and malice of the Priestes, and of the Egiptians, who sought to kill him, as the Iewes thought to kill <hi>Paul,</hi> but as <hi>Paul</hi> preuailed ouer the Iewes, so <hi>Moses</hi> preuailed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">The victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia.</note> the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> and marched forward with this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew army towards <hi>Aethiope,</hi> gaue them two great bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, ouerthrew them, chased them, and daunted the courage of the Aethiopians, that they were brought lower by the Hebrewes, then the Egiptians were before by the Aethiopians.</p>

               <p>AFter that <hi>Pharao</hi> and the Egiptians were drowned in the red sea, the Hebrewes had such rich spoyles by their dead bodies found on the sea shoares, that now the Hebrewes became from poore shepheardes called <hi>Hicsos</hi> in <hi>Egipt,</hi> to be rich souldiers, that neither <hi>Phillip</hi>

as the Hebrewes had of the spoyle of the Egip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians vpon the shoare. For now the Egiptians paie them their hires for the seruice and bondage of foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirtie yeares.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Philo</hi> said, that the borrowing of Iewels of siluer and Iewells of Golde, was nothing else but to paie <note place="margin">Philo.</note> the due debt vnto the Hebrewes, for their long bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and seruice.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Rupertus</hi> saide, the wages and hires which the Egiptians kept so long vniustly from the Hebrewes, by an honest guile the Hebrewes obtained their long deteined due, for the Lord commanded the Hebrues <note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> to borrowe Golde and siluer of the Egiptians: and the spoyle which is gotten of the enemies is due by the lawe of armes.</p>
               <p>The Hebrewes marched vnder <hi>Moses</hi> with Egiptian weapons, with songs of hymnes and Psalmes, for the victorie vnto the Lord. <hi>Myria Moses</hi> sister, the women and virgins of <hi>Israel,</hi> with violls, harpes, and tabrets, and with great melodie, gaue thankes vnto the Lord, so that it was afterwardes a custome among the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of <hi>Israel</hi> to sing Psalmes and Songes, to thanke the Lorde for their victories, and withall to aduaunce the fame of the Generalls and Captaines, as they did to <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Dauid.</hi>

               <p>The Lorde sets downe certaine martiall lawes to <hi>Moses,</hi> to gouerne and to rule his people, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to make two siluer Trumpets, to assemble the armie, to call the congregation, and for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing of the Campe, and charged the sonnes of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>

When thou goest out with the host against thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, keep thee then from all wickednes, be clean from pollution in the night, for the Lorde may not abide in the hoste any souldier that is any way vncleane, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be washt with water, and purified, and when a souldier must serue the necessitie of nature, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g other weapons he must haue his paddle staffe to dig the earth, <note place="margin">The 2. lawe of armes.</note> and after to couer his excrement, for the Lord would haue his people pure and holie both in soule and bodie, for the Lord walketh in the midst of the campe among his souldiers.</p>
               <p>The Hebrues were also commanded whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they went to any battell, that the Priest should stand before the whole armie, being called together with the sound of a trumpet, to exhort the armie, and to encourage them to feare nothing the multitude of their enemies, but to fight valiantly the battels of the Lorde, assuring them that the Lorde would be their Captaine, and goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">The 3. lawe of armes.</note> them, and therfore not to doubt of the victorie.

               <p>So the Lord said to <hi>Ioshua,</hi> that he would goe before him and his armie to <hi>Iericho.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Lord with the like words spake to <hi>Nabucho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donozer,</hi> when he went against <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>

               <p>As the Lord promised, not only to <hi>Moses,</hi> to <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and to others, but also to <hi>Nabuchodonozer</hi> &amp; <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Princes to goe before them in his own battels, and therefore the Heathen kings made their souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that the Gods taught them stratagems to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their enemies.</p>

               <p>So did <hi>Epaminandas,</hi> he caused the armor which did hang in the temples, and were dedicated to their Gods, <note place="margin">Front. lib. 1. cap. 11.

               <p>And like as <hi>Ioshua, Iosaphat</hi> &amp; <hi>Dauid,</hi> returned to giue thankes to the Lord, with violls, harpes &amp; trumpets for <note place="margin">Ioshua &amp;c.</note> their victories, so the Lacedemonians with trumpets and flutes, crowned with garlands made of all kinde of flowers, and with a song to <hi>Castor</hi> &amp; <hi>Pollux</hi> for any vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories which they had obtained. <note place="margin">Castor and Pollux.</note>

The Romanes also and the Grecians, not only with building of Temples and Aultars, but with the great sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice <hi>Haecatombae</hi> did please their Gods for theyr victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Hercules</hi> Temple in <hi>Sparta,</hi> the Armours that were hanged vp and consecrated to <hi>Hercules,</hi> seemed to make <note place="margin">Cic de diuin lib. 2.</note> a sound and and a noise, and at <hi>Thebes</hi> in the Temple of the same <hi>Hercules,</hi> the gates of the Temple being shut, were suddenly of themselues opened, and the shields and the targets that were hanged vp in the roofe of the Temple dedicated to <hi>Hercules,</hi> fel downe &amp; were found vpon the ground, which foreshewed to the soothsayers the destruction both of <hi>Sparta</hi> and <hi>Thebes.</hi> Now to the Hebrewes.</p>
               <p>The Lord commaunded that hee that buildeth a new house, and had not possessed it a yeare, should be spared from warre. <note place="margin">Ioseph. lib. 4. cap. 8.</note>

               <p>After the Priest had ended his exhortation to the souldiers, the Generall of the Army proclaimed that if <note place="margin">The lawe of Armes.</note> any timerous or fainthearted souldier were within the Army, hee should returne home, least hee through his cowardlinesse should disanimate or discourage the rest of his Army.</p>
               <p>Hence the Gentiles had the first instruction to vse the like long after this time, for the lawe of Armes which the Lord gaue vnto his people the Hebrewes in the wildernesse, were in all countries of the Gentiles afterwards imitated in all their warres. <note place="margin">The Priests Faecials in Rome.</note>

                  <p>Of the martiall lawes and military discipline of the Gentiles.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN all Countries, among all Nations where militarie <note place="margin">The martiall lawe of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt.</note> discipline was not obserued, there martial lawes were executed. As among the Egiptians the Souldier that brake militarie rules, to forsake the ranke, to goe out of the campe, and would disobey the chiefe magistrates, officers &amp; captaines of the armie, and would any waies offend the martiall lawes, he should be displaced from
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:9244:44"/>
his place, were he either Serieant, Lieutenant, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther officer, and be placed in the meanest place of the armie; and if he should bewray the counsell of his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, or speake any thing against the generall, he should haue his tongue cut off, and sowed vpon his helmet.</p>
               <p>Among the Persians there was a martiall law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that if any cowardly souldier should steale secretly from the campe, and become a vagabound or a runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place to place, he should (being taken) be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed <note place="margin">The marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all lawes of Persta.</note> in a womans apparell, and be chained fast with an Iron manicle vpon his hands, sitting with both his legs in a paire of stocks, in the midst of the campe, to be flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, and scoft at of all the whole armie, which in like sort the Thrasians obserued) and after hee should be taken for a woman and not for a man.</p>
               <p>The Romanes were somewhat more seuere against <note place="margin">The martiall lawe of the Romanes.</note> disobedient souldiers, especially against seditious &amp; fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiue souldiers, and against them that forsooke theyr standart, and turned their backes to the enemies, and from the camp to flee to the enemie, these amongst the Romanes were punished with death.</p>
               <p>The law in <hi>Sparta</hi> was, if any soldiers of theirs should in any great and shamefull faultes in the warres offend, they should be so noted and defamed, that they might <note place="margin">The martiall lawe of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians.</note> not borrow so much as a cup of water, or a brand of fire with their next neighbors, nor light a candle, besides it was not lawfull for any man that met the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the streets, to speak to them. These punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts far differ from the former punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Lord, fire fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the earth, the throwing into the feas, deuouring by lions, &amp; such of which I shall speake in another place.</p>

                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> so straightly besieged the citie <hi>Casselina,</hi> that the Romanes could by no meanes send a conuoy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the souldiers, the Romains deuised this stratagem, to fill certaine tunnes, some with flower, and some with meale, and to let them goe downe vpon the riuer <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnus,</hi> but the riuer being chained ouer by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> this stratagem was preuented.</p>

               <p>So also the Lord strengthened many of his people, to vanquish &amp; ouercome their enemies in seuerall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats, one man to ouercome many, as <hi>Sampson</hi> with the iaw bone of an asse slue a 1000.

but as the Lord commaunded the Hebrewes to burne such Idolatrous Iewels, destroy their gilded Images, and the gods of the Gentiles, and not to take the siluer and golde that is on theyr gods, as <hi>Achan</hi> did against the lawe at the Cittie of <hi>Ai,</hi> and dyed for it by the lawe.</p>
               <p>I will proceed for to shewe, in olde time in what sort and after what manner euery Nation entered into battell.</p>

               <p>The auntient Greeks vsed in their warres the skins <note place="margin">Homer. Illiad.</note> of sea dogges for theyr helmets, and for great plumes of feathers which souldiers vse now to weare, they vsed the manes and tailes of horses.</p>

               <p>The people of <hi>Mauritania</hi> came vnto the countries of their enemies with Elephants &amp; Lyons skins: so the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians vpon camels, and the Indians vpon Elephants came vnto the wars, which before <hi>Alexanders</hi> time were not seene in <hi>Asia,</hi> neither before <hi>Pirrhus</hi> time in <hi>Rome,</hi> which the Romans at the first sight thought strange, but after they had subdued <hi>Affrica,</hi> these strange beasts, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, camels, lyons, &amp; such, were in <hi>Rome,</hi> as in <hi>India</hi> or <note place="margin">Veget. lib. 3. cap. 24.</note> in <hi>Affrike,</hi> and vsed in <hi>Rome</hi> so familiarly and commonly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Theaters to fight with other beasts &amp; with men.</p>

               <p>In many Countreys they vsed to weare on their hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets the likenesse of Lyons, Wolues, Harts, Dragons, Dogs, Eagles, and other such beasts and fowles, as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Generalls or Captaines to weare for a terrour to the enemie.</p>
               <p>For in the Cymbrian warres against <hi>Marius,</hi> it is written in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that the Cymbrian horsemen ware on their helmets the likenesse of monstrous and terrible <note place="margin">Plut. in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio.</note>

               <p>And what enemie soeuer he slew in the field, might by the law of Armes take the Swords, Targets, Helmets and all other weapons of the enemie, and hang them vp as Tropheys at the doores and gates of his house, the rather to moue others by the sight thereof, with greater desire to armes, as the Belgeans were wont sometime to cut off the head of the slaine enemie, and to take off his bloudie garments, and to hang them vpon postes and trees, as trophies of victories.</p>
               <p>Now after the old and auncient maners and strange habites of diuers nations going into wars, as you haue <note place="margin">The account of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews for their souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> read of the Affricans, Arabians, and Indians, so also in numbring their souldiers, you shall read the manner of diuers natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, when they sent their souldiers to any bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and first of the Hebrewes, who brought account to <hi>Ioshua</hi> of the souldiers slaine and not slaine in battell.</p>
               <p>The custome among the Persians was, that the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that went to the wars should euery one take a shaft out of his quiuer, and write his name theron, and throw <note place="margin">The custome of the Persia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for their souldiers go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to wars.</note> the same vnto great chests before the chiefe magistrates, and that the souldiers that returned from the wars again aliue, shuld take their arrows fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the chest, that the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans therby might know the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of their lost souldiers.</p>
               <p>In like sort the Romans recorded the names of their souldiers in writing tables, that they might know at their returne from the wars by their names written, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were slaine in the warres.

               <p>Now after all these victories ouer the Canaanites, <hi>Iosuah</hi> returned to <hi>Gilgal,</hi> where the Campe was, and where the Arke remained, to giue thanks vnto the Lord for so many great victories he had ouer so many kings, and so many nations.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Ioshuah</hi> was dead, the manner of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues was to consult with the Lord, and to take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> of their further proceedings and choosing of a Generall, to leade &amp; gouerne them in their warre, as the like in all countries were vsed.</p>

               <p>So among the Latines, before the Romanes time, they met at the woods <hi>Ferentina,</hi> to decree and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of matters of warres: after the Romanes had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the Latins, they agreed vpon all causes of warres in the temple of <hi>Ianus</hi> in <hi>Rome.</hi>

So should all Kings, Generalls, and Captaines, hold that rule for a principall part of theyr charge, and not to commence warre without a iust cause, and lawful meanes to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iosias</hi> had no good cause to fight with <hi>Necho</hi> king of <hi>Egipt,</hi> who commaunded his souldiers not to fight with <note place="margin">Vniust and vnnecessary warres.</note> 
                  <hi>Iosias,</hi> but against <hi>Charchemish,</hi> a citie of the Assirians.</p>
               <p>So the King of <hi>Syria</hi> charged his souldiers to fight

with none but with <hi>Achab</hi> king of <hi>Israel,</hi> at what time <hi>Iosaphat</hi> king of <hi>Iudah</hi> was spared, and therefore retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned safe and sound to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> by the counsell of the king of <hi>Syria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had <hi>Iosias</hi> followed the counsell of <hi>Necho</hi> king of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt,</hi> as <hi>Iosaphat</hi> followed the counsell of the king of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Iosias</hi> had saued his life as <hi>Iosophat</hi> did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> fought with the Philistines, smote, scattered them, and slew them, that they fled before <hi>Dauids</hi> face <note place="margin">The battel of Dauid at Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Pharazim 2.

               <p>Againe, the Philistines gathered their force against <note place="margin">The victorie of Dauid at Rephaim. 2. Sam. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> at <hi>Rephaim,</hi> which is called the valley of Gyants, and <hi>Dauid</hi> ouerthrew the host of the Philistines, &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them from <hi>Geba</hi> vnto <hi>Gazar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An other battell of the Lord against the Philistines fought by <hi>Dauid,</hi> and he againe subdued them, &amp; tooke the strong citie of <hi>Gath,</hi> which they called the bridle of bondage, out of the hands of the Philistines. This citie <note place="margin">Gath the bridle of bondage.</note> kept the countrey round about in subiection and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. Thus all wise and skilfull generals ought to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <hi>Dauid</hi> herein, to seize by all warlike policie vpon those strong citties and fortes that can commaund the countrey.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Hanibal</hi> thought himself sure of <hi>Rome,</hi> hauing gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Capua</hi> and <hi>Tarentum,</hi> two of the strongest citties in <hi>Italy</hi>

into his hand. So the Romanes hauing gotten <hi>Syracusa,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Policies of Generalls.</note> doubted not to take <hi>Carthage:</hi> and hauing <hi>Carthage</hi> in their hands, they soone co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered all <hi>Affrike:</hi> and hauing <hi>Affricke,</hi> they made no account to win <hi>Asia:</hi> for at that verie time the best souldiers of the worlde were in the West kingdomes.

               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Dauid</hi> went forward in his victories, after he had gotten the strong citie of <hi>Gath,</hi> he smote <hi>Moab,</hi> and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured them with a cord, he slue them &amp; cast them down to the ground, he ouercame whom he would, and saued whom hee listed, so that the Moabites became <hi>Dauids</hi> seruants, and brought him gifts and presents, that the Lord made <hi>Dauid</hi> famous throughout all the world.</p>
               <p>During the time of <hi>Dauids</hi> warres against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites, and other nations their associates, there was no great warre then among the Syrians, neither in any part of <hi>Asia,</hi> and especially in <hi>Europe,</hi> which was scant <note place="margin">Europe scant inhabited in Dauids time</note> throughly inhabited in <hi>Dauids</hi> time, and therfore there was no such warre to be written of, as was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> between the Israelites and the Canaanites, in the time of <hi>Dauid.</hi> For as <hi>Ioshua</hi> slue the Canaanites, and gaue the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the land vnto <hi>Israel,</hi> so <hi>Dauid</hi> rooted them out, slue their gyants, and brought all the land tributary vnto <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> his sonne, who gouerned <hi>Israel</hi> fortie yeares in peace and quietnesse without warre.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Obserue the martiall proceedings of the Israelites, to put garrison in euery strong Citie and fort where they had subdued. So by these meanes <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi> before him, brought the Moabites, the Edomites, and the Philistines, and all theyr enemies round about to be vnder their gouernment. So after <hi>Dauid</hi> all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did the like (a principall point in all good Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls to strengthen themselues with garrison in strong places.)</p>
               <p>Herein the Remanes excelled all nations, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, or whosoeuer they subdued, there they placed <note place="margin">The Romain gouernours ouer diuers prouinces.</note> Romane Magistrates to gouerne. As <hi>Scypio</hi> and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> the great did in <hi>Asia, Titus</hi> and <hi>Sylla</hi> in <hi>Greece:</hi> this made the Romanes to be feared and dreaded among all nations of the worde.

the Carthagineans, they made <hi>Carthage</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince to bee gouerned vnder a Proconsull of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After they had subdued <hi>Numidia</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> they were made prouinces, and gouerned vnder a Consul of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>The fame of <hi>Dauid</hi> grew so great, that all the kings about him enuied him much, that <hi>Hamnon</hi> king of the Ammonites prepared an army against <hi>Dauid,</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that <hi>Dauid</hi> would reuenge the iniury hee did vnto his Embassadors, whome <hi>Dauid</hi> sent to <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> of meere kindnesse and courtesie, the cause was that <hi>Dauids</hi> Embassadours, by the King of <hi>Ammon,</hi>

               <p>If <hi>Moses, Iob, Dauid, Paul,</hi> and others, were thus buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted by Sathan, who can thinke himselfe free from the stratagems of Sathan? wee must therefore watch, if wee will not bee deceiued, and wee must fight if we thinke to haue victorie, our battell is not against flesh <note place="margin">Ephes. 6.</note> and bloud, but against power and states of heauens, against the prince and ruler of darknesse, and against spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enenemies.</p>
               <p>But the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> was sent to <hi>Dauid,</hi> to open vnto him the rewards of adultery and murther, &amp; that the sword should not go from <hi>Dauids</hi> house, the banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the punishment and miserie that should fall vpon <note place="margin">The rewards of adultery and murther</note> him for offending the Lord.

               <p>Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> sawe the iust iudgement of the Lord, and the tragicall end of his children, for offending the Lord. Euen <hi>Dauid</hi> that subdued so many nations, that got so many victories, that fought with a beare, with a lyon, and with a gyant, and subdued them, is now sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by a woman; had <hi>Dauid</hi> after these victories so much temperance and chastitie at the sight of <hi>Bethseba,</hi>

               <p>And for that the time of the taking away of <hi>Vriahs</hi> wife by <hi>Dauid,</hi> agreeth with the historie of the taking

               <p>But <hi>Asa</hi> began with praiers, &amp; cryed vnto the Lord by praiers for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> victorie, putting no trust in his own power, or pollicie, neither fearing the strength of the multitude of his enemies, &amp; so with full confidence in the Lord, he set vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Aethiopians, &amp; the Lord smote them before <hi>Asa</hi> and before <hi>Iudah,</hi> that the Aethiopians fled, and the army of <hi>Iudah</hi> followed, and pursued them vnto <hi>Gerer,</hi> for the Lord had striken the Aethiopians with such fear, that there was no life in them, that the slaughter was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great, &amp; the spoyle exceeding much, of camels, sheepe, and cattell. And <hi>Asa</hi> after the victorie which he had giuen him by the Lord, returned to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and gaue the Lord thankes, who giueth all victories, so as all good kings and generals ought to pray to the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they enter into battell, so ought they also to giue thankes after the battell, for their victories.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:9244:75"/>
This victory was a requitall and a full reuenge vpon the Aethiopians, for the sacking and spoyling of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and of the great slaughter of the people by <hi>Shesak</hi> king of <hi>Egipt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like maner as <hi>Abiah</hi> beganne with prayers before he beganne to battell, so did king <hi>Asa</hi> his sonne follow his fathers rule and order in seeking helpe and aide at the Lords hand, which euery King, Generall, or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine should doo. So <hi>Iosaphat Asas</hi> sonne did when it was tolde him that the Moabites, Ammonites &amp; Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites <note place="margin">Good kings praied for victories.</note> came with an infinit number to fight against him, he set himselfe to seeke the Lord, and to aske counsell of him, and all <hi>Iudah</hi> with him prayed vnto the Lorde, to aide and strengthen him to fight the Lords battel, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee got a maruellous victorie ouer his enemies, for <note place="margin">The victorie of Iosaphat. 2.

               <p>Where the Lorde leadeth the armie the victorie is soone gotten, so <hi>Iosaphat</hi> putting his whole trust &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the Lord, slue all his enemies that none did escape, and the spoyle was such of golde, of siluer, and pretious Iewels, that they were three dayes in gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and in carrying the spoyle away, and then they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled together after the victorie by <hi>Iosaphats</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement to giue the Lord thankes for the victory, and called the place where they got the victory <hi>Bera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Beracha.</note> and they returned to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with violls, harpes, and with trumpets.</p>

These three battels of <hi>Abiah, Asa,</hi> and <hi>Iosaphat,</hi> were battells of the Lord, and as the Lord had done at that battell at <hi>Michmash</hi> to <hi>Ionathan,</hi> so the Lord did now at the battell at <hi>Beracha</hi> to <hi>Iosaphat,</hi> and so the Lord in all the battels of the good kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> shewed alwaies his diuine stratagems for the defence of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> as in <hi>Egipt</hi> by <hi>Moses</hi> against <hi>Pharao,</hi> by <hi>Elias</hi> at the brooke <hi>Kyson</hi> against <hi>Baals</hi> prophets: by <hi>Elizeus</hi> at <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> against king <hi>Benhadads</hi> souldiers.</p>
               <p>The Gentiles in like sort, commence no warre, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Gentiles.</note> no battell before they sing a song vnto their gods: as the Lacedemonians brought vp onely in warre from seuen yeares old, vsed before they went to the warres, to <note place="margin">Plut. in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgo.</note> make solemne sacrifice to the Muses &amp; to the goddesse <hi>Feare,</hi> with a song to <hi>Castor</hi> &amp; <hi>Pollux.</hi> The Thrasians sing a song to their god <hi>Mars,</hi> and bragge much of <hi>Mars</hi> for that he was borne in <hi>Thracia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others made vowes when they went to any warres.

Yet the Syrians prepared such a number for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond battel, after they had escaped hardly from the first battell, that they filled all the countrie, and the children of <hi>Israel</hi> were like to little flockes of Kids in respect of their number: but the Lord sent his Prophet to <hi>Achab,</hi> saying: Because the Syrians haue said that the Lord is <note place="margin">The second victorie of Achab ouer Benhadad.</note> the God of the mountaines, and not God of the valleys, behold, this great multitude of men, and <hi>Benhadad</hi> the King himselfe, withal the two and thirtie Kings besides, will I deliuer to thine hand, and he shall know that I am the Lord as well of the valleys as the mountaines.</p>
               <p>And so the Lorde brought it to passe, that in that battell an hundred thousand footemen were slaine of the Syrians, and seuen and twentie thousand that fled from the field to <hi>Aphec</hi> to saue themselues, were killed by the fall of a wall that crushed them to death, and <hi>Benhadad</hi> the King fled to the citie, from chamber, to <note place="margin">The great victorie of Achab ouer Benhadad at Aphec.</note> chamber, and hid himselfe, according to the Prophets saying, vntill many of his chiefe Princes that escaped hardly from the battell, came with sackcloath about their loynes, and ropes about their neckes in token of submission, to entreate <hi>Achab</hi> king of <hi>Israel</hi> for the life of <hi>Benhadad,</hi> which he graunted, contrary to that which he was by the Lord commaunded for to do as <hi>Saul</hi> did by <hi>Agag</hi> king of the Amalekites, so <hi>Achab</hi> did by <hi>Benhadad,</hi> but it was told <hi>Achab</hi> by the Prophet, that his life should goe for his life, and his people for his people.</p>

               <p>The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> proceedeth forward to denounce the ouerthrow of those proud kingdomes, that reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <note place="margin">Iere. cap. 51.</note> much at the destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as <hi>Egipt</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon,</hi> and all the euill that should come vpon <hi>Babilon, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> wrote it in a booke, &amp; sent <hi>Sheraiah</hi> with his booke to read it, and when he had done reading, <hi>Ieremy</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him to binde a stone to the booke, and to cast it into the midst of the riuer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and then to say, thus shall <hi>Babilon</hi> be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founded; thus the Prophets vsed besides their prophesies to adde some action to make the words the more to be remembred.</p>
               <p>So also the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> prophesied against <hi>Egipt,</hi> and against their great cities, saying: The sword of the Lord shall come to <hi>Memphis,</hi> to <hi>Pellusium,</hi> and to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>

                  <hi>Pellusium</hi> the strength of <hi>Egipt,</hi> and I will make a great slaughter of all the men in <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For as <hi>Babilon</hi> was taken, <hi>Maradach</hi> ouerthrowne, and <hi>Bel</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founded, so was the strength of <hi>Egipt,</hi> &amp; the arme of <hi>Pharao</hi> destroyed without any recouery of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires againe, but so was not <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>

               <p>But <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as you heard by <hi>Ieremy,</hi> should not bee so destroyed, but should be defended against all her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the Lord shall destroy all nations that come against <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> for the Lord hath deliuered <hi>Israel</hi> out of the fierie furnace of <hi>Egipt,</hi> and from all the stratagems of the Heathens.

               <p>
                  <hi>Semyramis</hi> perceiuing that the Assirians were afrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and amazed, at the sight of so many Elephants, and that the king did purposely set his Elephants in sight to amaze the Assirians, which was the order of the India<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to terrifie all Princes with the sight of their Elephants: <note place="margin">Semyramis stratagem in India.

               <p>After these fained elephants, she placed such an infinit number of camels behind the armie, that the sight ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of much terrified <hi>Staurobates</hi> &amp; his army, that <hi>Semyramis</hi> by this stratagem got two great victories in <hi>India.</hi> But after these fained elephants were betraied by one of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myramis</hi> Captaines taken in the warres, who by torture confessed the secresie of <hi>Semyramis</hi> stratageme, that she was glad to leaue <hi>India,</hi> and to returne to her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>

               <p>The Argyraspides his principall souldiers, hauing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the most part of the army to auoyd shame &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, and to stick to their captain <hi>Alexander,</hi> whose only request was to haue them altogither at once to shoote at <note place="margin">Alex. his victorie ouer king Porus.</note>

               <p>Thus <hi>Alexander</hi> got the first victory in <hi>India,</hi> made a great slaughter, tooke their king, being sore wounded, &amp; deliuered him to his generals &amp; captains to cure: and <hi>Porus</hi> was substituted a king vnder <hi>Alexander</hi> in <hi>India.</hi>

               <p>So in <hi>Asia</hi> in many places Camels were their onely force in field.

               <p>
                  <hi>Pirrhus</hi> was a man so full of courage and valour, that when he was chalenged into a combat by a Generall of the Army, and though hee was wounded in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, yet bloudie as hee was, hee could not endure the challenge, but aunswered his challenger, and killed him.</p>

               <p>This was one of the most samous victories and rarest battels that euer the Grecians had ouer the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, though the battell at <hi>Artemisium</hi> and <hi>Salamina,</hi> by <hi>Themistocles,</hi> and the battell at <hi>Marathon</hi> by <hi>Milciades,</hi> were farre greater battailes, with such slaughters as <hi>Xerxes</hi> lost three hundred thousand Persians, yet none was fought with such a resolute courage, as noble <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidas</hi> did to the last man at <hi>Thermopyla.</hi>

               <p>But <hi>Themistocles</hi> forbad the contrary, saying, I had rather haue the Persians willing to depart out of <hi>Greece,</hi> then to force them desperately to fight in <hi>Greece</hi> against their wills: this time vsed <hi>Themistocles</hi> a subtill strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, he sent to <hi>Xerxes</hi> a secret messenger, and faigned himselfe to be <hi>Xerxes</hi> friend by the messenger, and tolde him what danger he was in, vnlesse he would make hast out of <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many vsed these kinde of stratagems, as <hi>Caesar</hi> did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Germains, and <hi>Agesilaus</hi> against the Thaebans, <note place="margin">Front. lib. 2. cap. 6.</note> for it was one of <hi>Pirrhus</hi> precepts left to his souldiers in writing, not to resist the violence of the enemy, being desperately vrged to fight.</p>
               <p>The like stratagem vsed <hi>Lu.

               <p>
                  <hi>Clau.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of military discipline and reward of souldiers among diuers nations.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all nations military discipline was so taught, and martiall lawes so obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that if they deserued by theyr good seruice any preferment, though hee were but a meane souldier, hee should not loose the honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of his aduancement, to rise by degrees from the lowest souldier vnto the highest cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and so in like sort by faults and offences commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they should be disgraded and casseerd from their gouernment and regiment, and bee punished further by the lawes military for them therin appointed, which I will intreat of, when I come to speake of euery seuerall country, of their warres, battels, and victories, then you shall finde the seuerall military discipline agreeable to the skilfulnesse of the captaine, the greatnesse of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and the nature of the place.</p>
               <p>It should seem that all nations of the world had their first instruction from the Hebrewes, as well their mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <note place="margin">The originall of military discipline fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Hebrues.</note> discipline, as martiall lawes, for the Lord comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Moses</hi> first in the wildernes to muster the people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> twentie yeares vpwards, and likewise <hi>Moses</hi> commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Ioshuah</hi> to muster the Hebrewes to fight against the Moabites, for that the Moabites denied them passage through their countrey into the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the Persians imitating the Hebrewes, their youthes from twentie to fiftie should be brought vp in warres, and no longer by the Persian lawe might they
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:9244:90"/>
continue in warres, but had their maintenance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment <note place="margin">Golden gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles giuen by the Hebrues and by the Persians to their souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of seruice.</note> after to liue at rest, &amp; to teach the yong youthes of <hi>Persia</hi> military discipline, hauing after their long ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice golden girdles giuen them by the king, to shewe their good seruice to their countrey, and their credite with the king of <hi>Persia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like lawe among the Scythians was duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued and carefully examined, that no souldier past fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie sixe yeares old should be chosen a fit souldier for the warres, though both in <hi>Persia</hi> and in <hi>Scythia,</hi> two nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">The order and lawe of the Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> euer in warres one with the other, their captaines and officers were men of knowledge, counsell &amp; autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, to instruct the army by whom they should be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned.</p>
               <p>So also the later Romanes being Polymarchies, and camp-maisters of the world, hauing brought all king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes &amp; countries vnder their gouernment, were not ignorant of all forraine, externall martiall lawes, and military discipline, but followed the Persians and the Scythians in instructing of their soldiers, making choise of the fittest, and yongest men, from twentie to fiftie, to serue the common-wealth. Though <hi>Camillus</hi> in his <note place="margin">Old souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander and Caesar much esteemed.</note> warres against the Latines and the Volscians, and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the great in his warres against the Grecians and the Persians made choyce of skilfull and olde souldiers, which were brought vp in warres before with <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> his father; to be in his Campe. So likewise did <hi>Caesar</hi> honour much his old souldiers.</p>
               <p>In later time the kings of <hi>Syria</hi> vsed to send collers of gold, robes of purple, and to be called the kings friends, to the chiefe captaines of the Iewes, so the Iewes were wont to send to the Romanes, and to the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, targets &amp; crownes of gold to be in league &amp; fauour <note place="margin">Collers of gold, &amp;c.</note>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:9244:91"/>
with the Romains, so that all nations sought fauour and friendship at the Romanes. So the Carthagineans sent to the Romans gifts &amp; rewards for captains &amp; generals.</p>
               <p>The Romane souldiers that were of courage, and knowne as Praetorian, legionarie or manupular souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, were rewarded with such gifts and presents, as they were in all countries preferred and aduanced from one office to another, esteemed &amp; extolled, with su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry kinds of gifts &amp; rewards, as crownes &amp; garlands, some crowns <note place="margin">Crownes and garlands of the Romains.</note> made of Lawrell, some made of mirtle, some of Popley, some of Oliue, and some of Pine, some made of Oaken boughes, for those that had saued cities or citizens.</p>
               <p>There were in the later time of the Emperours, new <note place="margin">Suet. in vita Calignlae.</note> kinds of crownes inuented, by the Emperour <hi>Caligula,</hi> made, some like the Sunne, others like the starres, called <hi>Exploratoriae coronae,</hi> Tribunes and great Captaines had bracelets and golden ringes.</p>
               <p>The Romains wanted no varietie of crownes &amp; gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, beside mony, lands, and other gifts. Besides there were certain speciall crownes &amp; garlands called <hi>Murales coronae,</hi> made like the walls of a citie, for those that scaled <note place="margin">Murales co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronae.</note> walles, as <hi>Cicinnanus;</hi> for others that besieged fortes, as <hi>Corilianus,</hi> crowns were made of green grasse, called <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronae graminea:</hi> for those that saued cities, or by sea fight, crowns made like a ship, called <hi>Coronae nauales</hi> wer giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as to <hi>Lu. Varro,</hi> by <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, in his warres against the Pyrates. Such crownes &amp; rewards were chiefly by the generall appointed by the law of armes, to be giuen <note place="margin">Aulus Geli. lib. 5. cap. 6.</note> to such souldiers that had either scaled walles, besieged forts, saued cities, or by sea fight. For euen as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls &amp; Generals might claime a tryumph by their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, so might the Collonels, Captains, and gallant soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, claime their garla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, &amp; military rewards for them for their seruice apointed. It was lawful for any Roman

               <p>
                  <hi>Iacob</hi> after his vision had in his dreame, tooke the <note place="margin">Bethel the house of God.</note> stone that he had laid vnder his head, set it vp, and made a pillar of stones in that place, and after hee had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed the same with oyle, which was the first an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing <note place="margin">Gen. 25.</note> wee read of in scripture, hee named it <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> which was <hi>Luz</hi> before, which name continued <note place="margin">Bethaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the house of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</note> vntill <hi>Ieroboams</hi> time, 784. yeares, at what time <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> erected a golden calfe to be worshipped, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was named <hi>Bethauen,</hi> as mount <hi>Olyuet,</hi> for that it <note place="margin">Osee. 10.</note> was full of Images, Idolls, and Aultars in the time of the Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> was named the mount of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Iacob</hi> when his wife <hi>Rachel</hi> dyed at the birth of her sonne whom she named <hi>Benoni,</hi> which <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> the Patriarke had care for the buriall of the faithfull, and bought a field therefore in <hi>Hebron</hi> for the <note place="margin">Abraham bought a field for his buriall.</note> burial of him, his wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> his children, and poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>

               <p>So the souldiers that obeyed <hi>Moses, Ioshua,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, were rewarded with all good blessings, with <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> and Quailes from heauen, and drunke of euerie rocke.</p>

                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:9244:100"/>
Besides, <hi>Moses</hi> was commaunded to lift vp a brazen Serpent in the wildernesse, that those that were stung, bitten, and daungerously hurt by Serpents, by looking on the brazen serpent should be healed. Thus were the Hebrewes fortie yeares in the wildernesse, where their <note place="margin">The brazen serpent.</note> shooes were not worne, theyr apparell, nor theyr gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments chaunged, and thus were the souldiers of <hi>Moses</hi> both punished for theyr faultes, and rewarded for their seruice. Now to the punishment militarie of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</p>
               <p>The Romanes which excelled all Nations for their liberalitie in rewarding good souldiers, and for theyr seueritie in punishing euill souldiers, had such cruell se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall lawes to inflict punishment, as farre exceeded all people.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> was so seuere for his military punishment, that he would cut off the right hand of any mutinous or seditious souldier within the campe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aufidius Cassius,</hi> being Consull and Generall in the field, would cut off both the hands &amp; the feete of those souldiers that so offended, saying, that they should haue no hands to fight with the enemies, nor feete to goe to the enemies.</p>
               <p>Euen so <hi>Scipio Affrican</hi> commaunded those souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that were seditious, to be deuoured of beastes, and <note place="margin">Seditious and mutinous Romane sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul. Aemilius</hi> commaunded them to feed Elephants.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Iul. Caesar</hi> thought no punishment sufficient for those that were seditious among their fellowes in the campe, and fled from the campe to the enemies. The Romanes woulde not suffer the least offence in a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier vnpunished. It was <hi>Caesars</hi> rule and order that his souldiers should come as braue to the field as himselfe, that no man knew the difference betwixt <hi>Caesar</hi> and his

For at the battell by the riuer of <hi>Larissus, Philopomen</hi> being Generall of the Achalans against the Aetolians, where hee slue <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantus</hi> Generall of the Aetolians, in a combat fought betweene them both in the sight of the armie, and after ouerthrew the whole hoste.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philopomen</hi> grew so great in <hi>Greece,</hi> that the name of <hi>Philopomen</hi> made the Baeotians to flie for feare from the siege of <hi>Maegara,</hi> and made the Spartans after he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the towne to forsake <hi>Licurgus</hi> lawe, and compelled the Lacedemonians to follow the Achaians maner and customes.

                  <hi>Philopomen,</hi> that <hi>Titus Flaminius,</hi> enuyed him for his fame and greatnesse in <hi>Greece,</hi> beeing then Consull of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had restored all <hi>Greece</hi> to her former liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Lucullus</hi> fought with <hi>Mithridates</hi> another battell at the riuer <hi>Granicus,</hi> where <hi>Alexander</hi> the great gaue the first battell to <hi>Darius</hi> king of <hi>Persia.</hi> Here also <hi>Lucullus</hi> in a very great battell fought with his Romane armie so <note place="margin">Appian. in lib.

               <p>This <hi>Mithridates</hi> was the greatest enemy that the Romanes had after <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and yet <hi>Hannibal</hi> and all <hi>Affrica</hi> was subdued within seuenteene yeares by the Romanes, and that most noble captaine <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> who fought with the Tarentines, Samnites &amp; others, against the Romanes, hee was driuen out of <hi>Italy</hi> within foure yeares, but <hi>Mithridates</hi> endured the fury of the Romans fortie yeares, vntill he was weakened by <hi>Sylla,</hi> wearied by <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and at last subdued by <hi>Pompey</hi> the great.</p>

                  <hi>Mithridates</hi> king of <hi>Pontus,</hi> fearing much the power and pollicies of the Romanes, frequented hunting, that he vsed no house in towne or country for seuen yeares, that thereby he was able to endure any labour and to preuent any stratagem of his enemies.</p>

               <p>The old Gaules vsed this manner of order, that their Senators called <hi>Druydes,</hi> called a councell of the chiefe <note place="margin">The olde Gaules.</note> men, which should be all armed, and therefore called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them the armed councell, and after consultation had between these Priests <hi>Druydes,</hi> and the armed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, that whatsoeuer was agreed vpon betweene them, ther of warre or peace, was established for a lawe.</p>

               <p>The ceremonies of euery natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in all countries in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of peace, was generally by bloud, and as it were confirmed by an oath in supping each others bloud, or by dipping in of their swords, arrowes, flint-stones or wooll. <note place="margin">The manner and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of peace.</note>

               <p>The old and auntient manner of the Persians was, to bring their wiues, their children, &amp; their dearest friends, <note place="margin">Persians.</note> and at their banquets, calling their hospitall gods to bee their witnesses, and their friends then present, to bee as pawnes, and pledges of their faith &amp; peace, by drinking one to an other.</p>
               <p>The Thracians and the Egiptians also had their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in contracting conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of peace, which was, to <note place="margin">The Thraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> drink wine out of an oxe horn one to an other, being an old ceremoniall custome among them of great antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for without drinking out of that oxe horne, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of peace could be taken in <hi>Egipt,</hi> or in <hi>Thracia,</hi> for the horne was an auntient monument reserued for that purpose.</p>

               <p>So the Egiptians came with poore simple garments, without weapons, to seeke peace at the enemies, and to yeeld themselues, their Priests carrying their gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them with sacrifice.</p>
               <p>So the cittizens of <hi>Alexandria</hi> came to yeeld them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to <hi>Caesar.</hi>

               <p>So the Gibeonites came to <hi>Ioshua,</hi> faigned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues <note place="margin">Ioshue. 9.</note> Embassadors, tooke olde sackes vpon their asses, and olde clowted shooes vpon their feete, and said vnto <hi>Ioshua,</hi> we be thy seruants, we be come from a far coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; so <hi>Ioshua</hi> consented vnto peace, made a league with them, and suffered them to liue.</p>
               <p>So the Sabine Embassadors when they came to yeeld themselues to the old Roman kings, were demanded by <hi>Torquin:</hi> Do you &amp; your people come to yeeld your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues <note place="margin">Liu. lib. 1.</note> to me &amp; my people at <hi>Rome,</hi> your lands, your waters, your cities, your temples, your wealth, your liberties, and all that you haue? the Embassadors answered wee

               <p>The Greekes likewise came as the Egiptians did, in sad mourning apparell, and offered boughes of Oliues, <note place="margin">The yeelding of the Greeks</note> and branches of Lawrell to the enemies, as signes and tokens of submission, in yeelding and in seeking of peace.</p>
               <p>The Persians maner was to offer land and water to the conquerour, as a signe of yeelding, for so the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <note place="margin">The maner of the yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Persians.</note> sought of others, when they tooke warres in hand, before they conquered, which was their pride &amp; brag.

               <p>The Assirians also according to their wonted man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <note place="margin">Assirians.</note> when they come to yeeld themselues, their Priests come with their labels, miters, and holy ornaments, to seeke peace at the enemy.</p>

               <p>With the Frenchmen and Spaniards, it was their custome and maner to yeeld to their enemies in shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hands and armes naked to the enemy.</p>

               <p>So <hi>Philopomen</hi> said, hearing certaine Grecians much commending a valiant captaine for his courage and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie; Can you said <hi>Philopomen,</hi> so commend a valiant <note place="margin">Philopomens speech of the Romanes.</note> captaine that yeelded himselfe, and was contented to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prisoner aliue?

               <p>So much the Romanes esteemed their targets, that laying them vpon their heades, though they yeelded their swords, their speares and other weapons to <hi>Caesar,</hi> yet would they not yeelde their targets but together with their heads.</p>

               <p>So <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Catulus</hi> both Gonsuls of <hi>Rome,</hi> in their warres against the Cymbrians, their souldiers, each one had his captaines name, and his owne name written on his shield and other military weapons, that by looking on their captaines name they might do the greater ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to honour their captaines.</p>
               <p>So auncient was the fame and honour in olde time giuen to targets and shields among the Grecians &amp; the Troians, that the name of <hi>Neptune</hi> was written in the shields of the Grecians, and the name of <hi>Minerua</hi> on the shields of the Troians.</p>
               <p>I will therefore speake something of the Grecian warres against the Persians, before I intreat of military discipline, and I will mention but foure principall spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall victories, which the Grecians had ouer the great kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> for that the Grecians may not be thoght to esteeme their targets for nothing.</p>
               <p>The first and most renowned victorie of the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <note place="margin">Plut. in Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stide.</note> ouer the Persians, at the battell of <hi>Plataea,</hi> where of sixe hundred thousand fighting men, which <hi>Mardonius</hi> Generall of the Persians had in his campe, there was <note place="margin">Oros. lib. 2. cap. 8.</note> slaine two hundred thousand Persians, and <hi>Mardonius</hi> himselfe slaine by a Spartan souldier vnder <hi>Pausanias.</hi>

so they said that the Babilonians should not come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and they were beleeued, and <hi>Ieremy</hi> impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned; so now for all these signes seene, and for all that Christ prophesied the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> &amp; wept vpon mount Olyuet for the same, yet the Iewes belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued no prophesie, weighed not the Romanes, no more then they weighed before the Babilonians.</p>
               <p>The like prophesie was found in <hi>Cataldus</hi> booke, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> being long time before dead, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in a vision to a Priest in <hi>Naples,</hi> and willed the <note place="margin">Alex.

               <p>In the twelfth yeare of <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Vespasian</hi> was se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with an army to subdue the Iewes, which could not be quiet, but rebelled euer against the Romanes, whom the Iewes mortally hated, though the Romanes had so many Presidents vnder them to gouerne the Iewes, as <hi>Pilate, Petronius, Festus, Albinus,</hi> and last of all, <hi>Florus.</hi>

               <p>The Iewes looked not for their destruction so nigh at hand, they obserued by tradition of some of their Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, that their <hi>Messias</hi> should come about the time of <hi>Augustus,</hi> as a magnificent mighty king, &amp; not as a poore man, the sonne of a Carpenter, whom the Iewes whipt and scourged, for that he tooke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to be the sonne of God, &amp; made himself <hi>Messias,</hi> the Iewes litle thought that he was the <hi>Messas,</hi> when they cryed to <hi>Pilate</hi> to haue him crucified in <hi>Golgotha,</hi> saying: his bloud be vpon vs, and vpon our children.</p>
               <p>The greedie desire and expectation of the people was such, that many tooke vpon them to call themselues the <note place="margin">Diuers faig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to be the Messias.</note> 
                  <hi>Messias,</hi> as <hi>Iudas Galileus,</hi> and an other called <hi>Atonges</hi> a shepheard: but aboue them all, one <hi>Barcozba</hi> had diuers followers, &amp; was receiued for their <hi>Messas</hi> thirtie yeares, but when they saw that he could not defend them from the Romanes, they would no longer accept him for their <hi>Messias,</hi> but slew him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> proceedeth forward to destroy the Iewes, but especially the Priests, the Scribes, &amp; Pharisies, on whom he had no mercie, saying, that they chiefly ought to dye with the sword, sithence the temple was burnt with fire, they onely being rebellious and seditious, and the cause of the destruction of the citie. <hi>Titus</hi> spared none of the stocke of <hi>Herod.</hi>

there was nothing but slaughter and blood, betweene the house of <hi>Israel</hi> &amp; the house of <hi>Iudah:</hi> and that straight after <hi>Solomons</hi> death 500. thousand were slain in mount <hi>Zemaraim</hi> of the king of <hi>Israels</hi> side, by the king of <hi>Iudah.</hi>

                  <hi>Solomons</hi> death in the time of <hi>Rehoboham</hi> his sonne, the state of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was so obscured &amp; altered, <note place="margin">Ioseph. lib. 8. cap. 8.</note> that the citie was sackt, and the temple robd, with great slaughter of people by <hi>Shesac</hi> king of <hi>Egipt,</hi> so that the wealth and treasure of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and of the temple, was carried by <hi>Shesac</hi> into <hi>Egipt.</hi>

Againe the kings of <hi>Israel</hi> became so Idolatrous, that there were no gods among the Heathens, but they were as gods worshipped in <hi>Israel,</hi> so that they were far worse then the Grecians or the Romans, who would allow no <note place="margin">Ioseph. lib. 9. cap. 14.</note> strange gods to raigne neither in <hi>Athens</hi> nor in <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore for that they forsooke the Lord, the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke them, and gaue them ouer, and their kingdome to the Assirians, by the hand of <hi>Salmanasser,</hi> and so <hi>Samaria</hi> and other townes in <hi>Israel</hi> were inhabited by strangers.</p>
               <p>So the kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> after <hi>Israel</hi> within 133. yeares after, were carried captiues into <hi>Babilon</hi> by <hi>Nabuchodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nozer,</hi> yet the Lord gaue them not ouer, but brought <note place="margin">Three great kings of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia fauoured the Iewes.</note> them within 70. yeares after againe to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> &amp; stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp <hi>Cyrus, Darius,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> three great kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> to fauour and to aide them with license to returne to their countrey, to inhabit <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with money and much treasure, to build vp the Temple, redeliuering vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them all the rich vessels of gold and siluer, which <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> left in the Temple at his death, and which <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chodonozer</hi> tooke away from the Temple, and brought to <hi>Babilon.</hi>

               <p>This house continued vntill the last destruction of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the Iewes after Christ his death, beeing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where afflicted and oppressed, from <hi>Babilon</hi> were forced to flie to <hi>Zeleucia,</hi> the chiefe Citie in all <hi>Syria,</hi>

               <p>So sedition also began between the Iewes in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> and the Aegiptians: in <hi>Samaria</hi> betweene the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans and the Iewes, and all the Iewes which dwelt <note place="margin">Ioseph. lib. 9. cap. 14.</note> in <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> &amp; other places of the Romaine Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, were from thence banished.</p>
               <p>These Iewes had not so much as a place to rest vpon the earth, but were scattered like rogues &amp; vagabounds euery where, without credit or loue, without Prince, Priest, law or religion, (the iust iudgement of the Lord) for their blasphemy against the sonne of God, saying: his bloud be vpon vs and our children.

So did the Gaules in the warres of <hi>Carthage,</hi> slew the watch of the Romanes, and fled to <hi>Haniball.</hi>

               <p>The lawe of armes in euery countrey should holde and maintain the crowne &amp; dignity of the prince by the sword, so most necessary it is, that subiects should be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vnto with great care and prouision to maintain the <note place="margin">Care of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries for soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> willing, forward, and good souldiers, &amp; due punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and sharpe corrections for euill, leaud, &amp; wicked dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed men, carelesse of their countries good.

                  <hi>Agesilaus</hi> therefore appointed gifts and rewards to draw and encourage his souldiers to shoote, to throwe the dart, the sling, to ride, to runne, and with diligence and care to keepe them seuerely from faults &amp; offences, and to exercise them in martiall feates, which kinde of <note place="margin">Agesilaus his exercise for his souldiers.</note> exercise among the Greekes was most commonly vsed, called <hi>Pentatlon,</hi> in the games of <hi>Olympia</hi> &amp; <hi>Isthmia,</hi> to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Thesius,</hi> two protectors and principall captaines that loued souldiers.</p>

               <p>The like hardinesse and courage was found in <hi>Masi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa</hi> king of <hi>Numidia,</hi> being foure score yeares old, that he in the cold winter and hard frost, bareheaded, would march before his souldiers ouer mountaines, through <note place="margin">Masinissas hardinesse in marching.</note> woods and desart places, with such paine and trauell, with such hunger and thirst, as hee beeing a king and a captain, marching before, heauie and laden with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, the souldiers were kindled with great courage to follow after, being driuen therevnto for very shame, to imitate such a valiant captaine.

                  <hi>Fabius Max.</hi> would neuer suffer his souldiers to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sloathfull or idle, but before they should take any ease, he would stil remoue his whole camp from place <note place="margin">The dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Fabius Max. to his souldiers.</note> place, to keepe his souldiers in exercise of seruice, and to auoyd sluggishnesse and idlenesse, which idlenesse was the first beginning of <hi>Hannibals</hi> ruine in <hi>Italy,</hi> and as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter followed the whole ouerthrow of all his Affrican Army in <hi>Campania,</hi> for they still tooke their ease and pleasure in <hi>Capua</hi> without military trauell of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.</p>
               <p>For we read that <hi>Epaminondas</hi> that famous Thaehan captaine, finding one of his souldiers idle and sleeping in his tent, did runne him through with his speare, and turning to his army, said, wee left this souldier as wee found him.</p>

               <p>And so <hi>Caesar</hi> said, that the souldiers that could not vse their swords and shields, should vse the mattock and spade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bochoris</hi> decreed a military lawe against sloathfull <note place="margin">Bochoris lawes. Diod. sic. lib. 12.</note> and idle souldiers in <hi>Egipt,</hi> that would not obey theyr captaines, or forsooke their standart, they should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoue

from the place where they serued, and become <hi>agrarij milites,</hi> base souldiers as they began first, and if any souldier would open any secrets to the enemies, he should haue his tongue cut out of his head by the lawe of <hi>Bochoris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fatte and full fed souldier among the Romanes, that neither could nor would take paines on foote or on horse, the captain might take his horse from vnder him, and giue him to an other.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Agesilaus</hi> did in the <hi>Peloponesian</hi> warres in <hi>Greece,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Agesilaus military dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</note> for when he sawe young braue souldiers of <hi>Asia</hi> in his campe, which had more pride in their apparell, then care of their seruice, more like to women then to men, <hi>Agesilaus</hi> tooke their braue and fine apparell from them, and gaue it to those souldiers that better deserued it, and forced them to serue very bare and naked, vntill they knew better how to become souldiers.</p>
               <p>So the Romanes vsed to take the speares from those souldiers that were giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to idlenesse and sloathfulnesse, though before through seruice they wonne them, and deserued them. They also vsed to open a vaine vpon the forehead of a wilde, rash, and disobedient souldier, to let him bleed to become sober.</p>
               <p>The Gaules vsed to put a marke vpon the souldiers girdle, which if the souldier through idlenes would not keepe himselfe within that marke, he should be straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Caesar. lib. 5. de bello gallic.</note> kept in prison with thin dyet, vntill the marke of his girdle would serue him.</p>
               <p>The olde Gaules had an other lawe, that hee which came last to the muster should be slaine in the presence of the multitude, for that hee seemed vnwilling to come, &amp; to be with the first to answere for himselfe and for his countrey.</p>

It was so also among the Romanes, that hee which would not answere to the first call at any publike muster of souldiers, should be noted as a great offender to his country, and banished out of his countrey, as a man not borne nor fit for his countrey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eumenes</hi> a noble captaine, a souldier of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, to take that sluggishnesse from his souldiers that grew by idlenesse, did acquaint them with trauell and paine to keepe them in breath, sometimes marching for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">The exercise of Eumenes to his souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> faire and softly, and then retiring with great haste vpon the sudden, much like to the Parthians in theyr fighting, taking vpon them to flee for feare from the enemies, to drawe the enemies after them, and then to returne vpon the sudden againe to fight with their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: so did <hi>Eumenes</hi> by his souldiers, which made them readie in seruice as well backwards as forwards, which many captaines vsed as stratagems.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fabius Max.</hi> thought good to reclaime the faults of an euil and ignorant souldier by lenitie and gentlenesse, and wished no captaine to vse his souldiers more sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then the husbandman vsed his Figge trees, Oliue trees, and wilde Pomegranates, which by pruming <note place="margin">Fabius Max.</note> and good handling of them, do alter their hard &amp; wilde nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charondas</hi> made a lawe to punish those souldiers that loytred in their countrey, and refused to goe to warres for their countrey, and also those souldiers that were in the warres, that brake any martial order by leauing their ensigne and their company, the souldier that so offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, should be cloathed in a womans apparell, and bee brought into the midst of the campe, and there to stand in the sight of all the army three seuerall daies together.

               <p>The old Romanes for the greatest punishment they had for their slaues in <hi>Martius Corilianus</hi> time, was, to carrie a limmer on his shoulders, that is fastned to the axeltree of a coach called <hi>Furea,</hi> and compelled to go vp and downe in that sort among his neighbours, and after to be called <hi>Furciser.</hi>

               <p>If any be desirous of more military punishments, let him read <hi>Vegetius,</hi> the third booke and fourth chapter, where hee setteth downe that if a souldier beeing puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed for any offence by him committed, should contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his Captaine or the Collonell, by resisting or stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Military pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for souldiers.</note> his captaines hands, or by breaking the staffe or the sticke wherwith he is punished, he is by martiall law dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed from the place he serueth in, and quite remoued from the campe.</p>
               <p>If any souldier resist correction, &amp; lay violent hands on his Captaine or Collonell when he is corrected, he is to suffer capitall punishment, which is death by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall law appointed.</p>

                  <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> commaunded those souldiers that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in the campe, with sloathfulnesse and idlenesse, which framed not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues like souldiers, to carry vpon <note place="margin">Augustus Caesar.</note>

               <p>Among the Carthaginians, the Lacedemonians, and they of <hi>Creete,</hi> a lawe was made, confirmed by <hi>Plato</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Plato.</note> in <hi>Greece,</hi> that no souldier might drinke wine during the time of theyr warres, which made <hi>Marius</hi> to speake to his Armye, perceiuing them to bee verie thyrstie, we must breake our thirst in yonder Riuer after the battell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pittacus</hi> a singular wise man, made the like lawe in <note place="margin">Pittacus.</note> 
                  <hi>Mittelena,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi> made in <hi>Greece,</hi> that the souldiers that would drinke wine, might receiue double punishment without pay.</p>
               <p>Among the Romanes seuere lawes were made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst wine drinkers, and executed not onely vpon soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers by the Generall, but also vpon the women in <hi>Rome</hi> by their husbands, as <hi>Egnat.

               <p>If any souldier should go any where out of their camp,

and be found without sword and weapons about him, <note place="margin">Cornel. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit. lib. 2. Ueget. lib. 3. cap. 8.</note> he should be accused of a capital crime, &amp; hardly escape death, vnlesse it were the first offence of a yong soldier.</p>
               <p>Those souldiers that cast vp bankes, made trenches and diches, might not be without weapons about them, though they were but <hi>agrarij milites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So vsed <hi>Marius,</hi> and after him <hi>Caesar,</hi> they made their souldiers to worke with their swords on their sides, and mattockes in their hands.</p>
               <p>So did the Iewes for feare of the Samaritans, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, build vp <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the temple, hauing theyr weapons in one hand, and working with the other.</p>
               <p>

               <p>So did <hi>Cyrus</hi> the great king of <hi>Persia,</hi> with the like care keepe his souldiers from slothfull idlenesse, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding his Generalls &amp; Captaines to exercise theyr souldiers with paine &amp; trauell, to suffer hunger &amp; colde <note place="margin">Cyrus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline to his souldiers.</note> without meate or drinke, before they woulde certifie their captaine what military exercise either on foote, or on horse they had done.</p>
               <p>And after that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had conquered the Lydians, knowing them to be false and treacherous fellowes, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cowards &amp; timerous soldiers, he dismissed them from his campe, and suffred them not to stay among his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, because they should not infect souldiers, nor cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt military discipline.</p>

For that the martiall disciplines of the Romaines were such as I thought good to make a catalogue as I found them in the Commentary vpon <hi>Vegetius, virgis caedi, vite verberari, linguae abscissio,</hi> this kinde of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vsed the Egiptians, by a lawe confirmed in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt,</hi> to cut off the souldiers tongue that betrayed any counsell to the enemie: the fourth punishment among the Romanes was <hi>Manuu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amputatio,</hi> to cut off the hands of those souldiers that were founde stealing or filching in the campe. The fift punishment was <hi>Crurum exectio,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Polib. lib. 6.</note> the breaking of the legges of those souldiers that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke theyr standart, and so to leaue them without legs <note place="margin">Tacit. lib. 3. anual.</note> to staie behinde, because when he had legges he would not follow his standart.</p>
               <p>Another punishment they had called <hi>Decimation,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Val. max. li. 2 cap. 7.</note> for offences among the souldiers vnknowne, the tenth man by lot as it fel vpon him should die throughout the whole company: this punishment <hi>Decimation,</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented first by <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> which long endured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Romanes, and most frequented.</p>
               <p>The seuenth punishment was for them that fled to the enemies, and returned to be eaten and deuoured of beasts.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Scipio Affrican</hi> punished some Romain fugitiues.</p>
               <p>Another punishment among the Romane souldiers, was to be stoned to death, so was <hi>Posthumius</hi> stoned in his Tents.</p>
               <p>Another punishment among souldiers, was to be shot to death the souldier being tied to a stake.

In this the Romaines differed from the Persians, <note place="margin">Mercenary souldiers.</note> hardly would the Romanes trust any mercenary soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, or suffer any straunger as a souldier to be within their campe.</p>

               <p>After the Romanes had subdued <hi>Italy,</hi> their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men and next neighbours, they graunted to the Volsces, the Tyrrhens, the Samnites, Lucans, Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines &amp; Thuscans, the Romane lawe called <hi>Ius Latij.</hi>

               <p>The Israelites in like sort as the Romanes before they conquered the Canaanites, they agreed and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their force together, and the Lord prospered theyr warres when they serued him, that from <hi>Ioshuahs</hi> time, who brought them and gaue them the possession of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> vnto <hi>Dauids</hi> time, who setled the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites as the Lords ouer the Canaanites, that the Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, Ammonites, and other nations about payed tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to <hi>Dauid,</hi> and to his successors, and that there was no king, no nation, but feared and trembled at the name of <hi>Israel.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thus hee encouraged his souldiers in <hi>Affrica</hi> by reason of his white hinde, as <hi>Lucius Sylla</hi> did practise manye such Stratagemes in <hi>Asia,</hi> who did make

                  <hi>Scipio Affrican</hi> in like maner would take no publike matter in hand before he had gone to the Capitoll and consulted with <hi>Iupiter,</hi> whereby the souldiers were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, and hee also enformed them before he entered <note place="margin">Scipio his stratagem to his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> into any battell, that they need not doubt of victories, for so hee himselfe was instructed by a messenger from <hi>Iupiter.</hi> Thus were the souldiers of the Gentiles blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with their owne superstitiousnesse, that they would beleeue their captaines in any thing they spake, that their lawes were made, and victories were gotten by the false oracles of their Idolls.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Sertorius</hi> did by his white hinde. <hi>Sylla</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting with <hi>Appollo. Cai.

               <p>So was <hi>Archilocus</hi> banished from <hi>Sparta,</hi> for that he said, I had rather loose my shield then my life.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It seemed by the instructions of the Gentiles to their souldiers, set forth in their lawes of Armes, that they were most carefull to haue them brought into such straight obseruations, by obedience to their chiefe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls and officers: for it was no small reproach nor little shame, but for euer publike infamy amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Romains, <note place="margin">Military pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the Romains.</note> for any souldier, captain, collonel, or any other officer, to be disauthorised &amp; reiected from his former dignitie of seruice, to disarmor him of his weapons, to take his horse fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder him, to be vnspurd, to take his speare out of his hand, his shooes from his feete, his gyrdle from his mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, to giue him barley for wheate, to goe barefooted, and to begin againe to be <hi>Agrarius miles,</hi> to be a meane souldier, so seuere were the Romanes against disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient souldiers.</p>
               <p>It was an auntient lawe among the olde Romanes, that the Captaines and Centurions that fled from their company should stand with their garments loose, and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:9244:134"/>
their swords drawne in their hands in the midst of the campe, which was one of the greatest &amp; infamousest pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments among the Romanes for a Romane captain.</p>
               <p>The penall law they had in <hi>Sparta</hi> against those that <note place="margin">Plut. in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgo.</note> fled from the battell, they were compelled to weare old tattered rags, and to shaue the one side of their beards, <note place="margin">A penall law in Sparta for souldiers.</note> and to bee reuiled and flowted of euery man that met them, that it was not lawfull for them to giue any word of answering.</p>
               <p>And if they were captaines, or any great officers in the field, they should weare an olde patched gowne of diuers colours, they should beare no office in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth after that time, they might haue no mans daughter to marriage, neither would any marrie theyr daughters, but as men left to liue in shame without any credite, forsaken and refused to come into any Spartans company, for euery man liued in that warlike towne <hi>Sparta</hi> as in a campe, where each souldier knew his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, and what he had to do: for the bondmen cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">Helotes.</note>

               </p>
               <p>The Lacedemonians of all people so honoured mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall discipline, that they studied nothing but to endure <note place="margin">How the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians march to their warres.</note> all labours, to sustaine any paine, and to be ready alwaies to fight, and when they marched in battell ray to any set battell, they put theyr garlands of flowers on theyr heads in the very face of the enemie, and sung a song to <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> commaunding their warlike instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to sound, and to agree with the Dittie of theyr

               <p>The Massagets went also vnto any battel in such co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured cassocks as best resembled the colour of bloud, <note place="margin">Massagets.</note> least the sight of bloud should terrifie some cowardly faint hearted souldier of their army.</p>
               <p>The Aethiopians held a cleane contrary opinion to the Massagets, they went into the warres all in white <note place="margin">Aethiopians</note> colour, because they might the more be encouraged by the sight of bloud to reuenge bloud, and as the Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians would often say, that bloud should be reuenged when they sawe their bloud.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> king of <hi>Persia,</hi> came with an army of nine hundred thousand, all in red iackets, against his brother <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to the battel of <hi>Conoxa,</hi> where <hi>Cyrus</hi> gaue him bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell with a great army, all in white cassockes.</p>

               <p>The Persians for that they prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the faith of their souldiers before any profit, they were compelled to sweare by the Sunne, sometime by fire, called their god <note place="margin">The Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans oath.</note> 
                  <hi>Orimasdes,</hi> to obey and follow the comman dements of their Generals, according to the martiall law of <hi>Persia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the Romanes a military oath was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ministred vnto the souldiers to obey the direction and correction of the Consuls, but also the Consuls and Praetors themselues were sworne, before the Senators <note place="margin">Consuls dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed.</note> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they should attempt no battell without full instruction from the Senators, for many Consuls, Praetors, and Generals, haue bene displaced from theyr Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sulships, for not obeying the orders of the Senators.</p>
               <p>The same obseruation of oathes as well of captaines as of the souldiers, were ministred to the souldiers by the magistrates in <hi>Sparta,</hi> called <hi>Ephori,</hi> though the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians in their warres against the Messenians, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as much their aultars, their gods, and their faith, as the Athenians did against the Maegarians, who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their souldiers to take an annuall oath, to waste, to spoyle, and to destroy, and to do as much harme as they could to the Maegarians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:9244:135"/>
The Aethiopians and Egiptians made their souldiers to sweare by the names of those noble dead captaines, whose seruice aliue did most aduance their countrey, whose bodies they preserued with all sweete odours in glasse, in their sumptuous tombes.</p>
               <p>The Thracians and the Scythians, laying their stand <note place="margin">The Thraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an oath.</note> vpon the sword of <hi>Mars,</hi> make their souldiers sweare in solemne sort, to performe true seruice to <hi>Mars</hi> &amp; to their countrey.</p>
               <p>When King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> would haue <hi>Hipocrates</hi> the Phisition to be sworne towards him, and offered him a <note place="margin">Hypocrates.

               </p>
               <p>The oath that <hi>Benhadad</hi> king of <hi>Syria</hi> sware vnto <hi>Achab</hi> king of <hi>Israel</hi> was, thus the gods do vnto me, <note place="margin">Benhadads oath.</note> if thou doost not deliuer me all thy treasures, and yeelde thy selfe vnto mee, the dust of <hi>Samaria</hi> shall not bee enough for euery one of my souldiers to take a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>As you heard of the Lacedemonians against the Messenians, and of the Athenians against the Maegari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, so the Thessalians weighed so little their oathes, that in the Peloponesian warre they fled from the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <note place="margin">The Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians oath.</note> vnto the Lacedemonians, making no account of their oathes before made to the Athenians, like the Parthians which made no account of a military oath in warres.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the infidelitie of the Thessalians, the Parthians, and others, I thinke it conuenient to set downe the olde auntient forme of the Romanes, when they ministred oathes vnto theyr souldiers or

               <p>The same words in effect did <hi>Scipio Affrican</hi> vse to <hi>Lu.

               </p>
               <p>After this great battell <hi>Hanibals</hi> force and fortune began to bee weakened, and hee made meanes to <hi>Scypio</hi> for peace, and great <hi>Carthage</hi> began to alter and chaunge, and yet were they most angry with <hi>Hanibal,</hi> for that he counselled them not to follow their vaine hope of any victory, but rather to entreat for peace at the Romanes. But <hi>Carthage</hi> could not abide the name of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor <hi>Rome Carthage,</hi> and therefore forced <hi>Hanibal</hi> to take the battell at <hi>Zama</hi> in hand, which was <note place="margin">The battel at Zama.</note> the last battell and the vtter ouerthrow of <hi>Hanibal</hi> and of all the Carthagineans.</p>
               <p>The Affricans and the Carthagineans almost like the Romanes, laide theyr hands on the Aultars of theyr Countrey goddes, and on the sacrifice, holding in <note place="margin">Liui. lib. 31.</note> the left hand a lambe, and in the right hand a flint stone, saying: If they otherwise spake then truth, <note place="margin">Carthage.</note> or that they should deceiue any man to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, so they wished that <hi>Iupiter</hi> should strike them as dead, as they did strike the lambe with the flint stone.</p>
               <p>The latter Romanes made their souldiers to sweare by the name of the Emperours, as the souldiers sware by the name of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and by the name of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus.</hi>

                  <hi>Sylla</hi> fought with captaines of greatest power and ouercame them.

               <p>After that <hi>Pompey</hi> had subdued all <hi>Sertorius</hi> captains, and at last <hi>Sertorius</hi> himselfe, he tooke king <hi>Iarbas,</hi> who <note place="margin">The martiall exploits of Pompey.</note> fought on <hi>Domitius</hi> side, one of <hi>Sertorius</hi> captaines, and brought him prisoner to <hi>Rome</hi> in his triumph.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> hauing bene neither Praetor, Consul, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator, had his triumph granted him against the lawe, when he was but 24. yeares of age.</p>

               <p>Yet had <hi>Pompey</hi> his hands full with <hi>Sertorius</hi> at the battell of <hi>Lauron,</hi> a noble and valiant captaine on <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> side, and one that galled <hi>Pompey</hi> more then all the rest, for <hi>Pompey</hi> could do no good though hee sawe the citie of <hi>Lauron</hi> burnt before his face, where <hi>Sertorius</hi> shewed himselfe a most skilfull and valiant captaine.</p>
               <p>

In like sort at the battell hard by the Riuer <hi>Sucron, Pompey</hi> had his hands full with <hi>Sertorius,</hi> where <hi>Pompey</hi> was forced to take his horse, and driuen from his horse, <note place="margin">The battell at Sucron.</note> to flye, and in his flight to forsake his horse, &amp; to take his feete, and to leaue his horse for a pray to <hi>Sertorius Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> souldiers, being so rich a spoile to stay the enemies, who fought for the horse, and let <hi>Pompey</hi> goe.</p>
               <p>The Gaules hauing a great battell to fight with <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talus</hi> king of <hi>Asia,</hi> deliuered all their gold and siluer to be kept, that if they were driuen to flye, they should scatter the gold and siluer vpon the way, that by staying the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies <note place="margin">Front. lib. 2. cap. 13.</note> to gather vp the gold &amp; siluer so dispersed, they themselues might escape.</p>
               <p>The like stratagem vsed <hi>Mithridates</hi> king of <hi>Pontus,</hi> to saue himselfe, who fled from the enemies that follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed hard after him, who left a Mule laden with golde <note place="margin">Mithridates stratagems and others.</note> and siluer, a bootie which <hi>Mithridates</hi> knew would please the Romanes, to stay them, and to saue himselfe from <hi>Lucullus</hi> souldiers.</p>
               <p>So did <hi>Triphon</hi> king of <hi>Syria</hi> (to escape from king <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> horsemen) scattered money euery where on the <note place="margin">Triphon.</note> way, to stay <hi>Antiochus</hi> souldiers that <hi>Triphon</hi> might escape, so did <hi>Alaricus</hi> king of the Goates and others, saue themselues by the like policies.</p>
               <p>Fewe great captaines hardly escaped with their liues from diuers dangers and perils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> hardly escaped from <hi>Telesinus</hi> at the battell of <hi>Antemna,</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> himselfe after he had lost 32.

               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Pompey</hi> vnder <hi>Sylla, Sylla</hi> vnder <hi>Marius, Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> vnder <hi>Scypio,</hi> and <hi>Scypio</hi> vnder his father, whom hee rescued in the battell at <hi>Canne</hi> from the Affricans, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the great rescued his father <hi>Philip</hi> at the battell at <hi>Cheronea,</hi> being but eighteene yeares of age, as <hi>Scypio</hi> was, when he rescued his father at <hi>Canne.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> practised among the Gaules his secret ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which was such, that he went as a Romane captain with his army far from <hi>Rome,</hi> to practise his stratagems, where he conquered the Gaules with the weapons of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, <note place="margin">Caesars am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition against Rome.</note> and wonne the Romanes with money of the Gaules, fewe in <hi>Rome</hi> knew this, but such as he fed with money in <hi>Rome</hi> to be his friends.</p>
               <p>

Hence grew the malice and enuie betwneene <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> for <hi>Pompey</hi> could not abide his equall in <hi>Rome,</hi> nor <hi>Caesar</hi> his superiour. <note place="margin">Plut. in Caesare.</note>

                  <hi>Caesar</hi> was suspected to be confederate with <hi>Cateline</hi> in his conspiracie, not onely to ouerthrow the state of the Common-wealth, but also to destroy the whole Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the which cause <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Piso</hi> fell out with <hi>Cicero,</hi> for that hee then beeing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull, had not bewrayed <hi>Caesar,</hi> when <hi>Cicero</hi> well might <note place="margin">Plut. in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero.</note> haue done it, for many sawe the greatnesse of <hi>Caesar</hi> farre from <hi>Rome</hi> before hee came to <hi>Rome,</hi> they sawe his courage and minde to bee inuincible, his marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all skill to bee singular, that such was his conquests o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Gaules in tenne yeares, that hee tooke aboue eight hundred Townes, and hauing such an infinite number of enemies, of thirtie hundred thousand soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, Gaules, Germaines, Teutons, and diuers others, he slew of them at seuerall times aboue tenne hundred thousand.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>Caesars</hi> praise, his warres, his battels, his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <note place="margin">Caesars praise.</note> and conquests, had excelled all the strongest kings and princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> had he not onely shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe an enemie to his Countrey in the battell at <hi>Pharsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> where <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, the Senators, and the most part of the noble men of <hi>Rome</hi> were slain, ouerthrowne, and taken.</p>
               <p>Had <hi>Caesar</hi> bene in the time of <hi>Hanibal,</hi> of whom <hi>Scypio</hi> demanded, who had bene, and were the greatest captaines of the world, to whom he answered, <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Againe, he tooke three campes in one day, and slue fiftie thousand of his enemies, and lost but fiftie of his souldiers for all the force of king <hi>Iuba, Cato, Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Affranius.</hi>

               <p>The souldiers of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> perceiuing that the winde blew away the labell, which hangd as an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about <hi>Epaminondas</hi> speare, and lighted vpon the graue of a dead Lacedemonian, at the which sight the Thaebans were so frighted, vntill <hi>Epaminondas</hi> said vnto them merily, Ah worthie souldiers, this signifieth the <note place="margin">Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme.</note> ouerthrowe of the Lacedemonians, and forewarneth them of their buriall.

               <p>
                  <hi>Scipio Affrican</hi> sayling from <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Affrica,</hi> at his going out of his ship had a fall, which not a litle moued the souldiers, who tooke it for a signe of no good lucke, <note place="margin">Front. lib. 1. cap. 12.</note> hee perceiuing by his souldiers that they were amazed and astonished at his fall, spake vnto them presently with a merrie countenance and said; <hi>Ludite milites, Affricans oppressi,</hi> Be merrie souldiers I haue ouercome <hi>Affricke,</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:9244:142"/>
and so by this stratagem he turned their doubts &amp; feare into boldnesse and stoutnesse.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Scipio</hi> spake <hi>Affricam oppressi,</hi> I ouercame <hi>Affrike,</hi> so likewise we may speake through Christ that eternall <hi>Scipio</hi> &amp; staffe of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who ouercame not only <hi>Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> but the whole world, &amp; the prince of the same Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

               <p>This was not to be called a tryumphe, because it was done in the time of ciuill discord, for that in ciuill warres among the Romanes, it was decreed by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, <note place="margin">No triumphs in ciuil wars at Rome.</note> that no Romane might tryumphe ouer another Romane, so it was also among the Thaebans, <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi> might not tryumphe ouer the Lacedemonians for his victorie at <hi>Leuctres.</hi>

               <p>In this battell <hi>Brutus</hi> one of the Consuls died, who not by chaunce, but of set purpose, sought to encounter with <hi>Aruns,</hi> king <hi>Torquines</hi> eldest sonne, to execute the deadly malice they bare each other, that fighting so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately with such furie that one killed another dead at once.</p>
               <p>The first tryumphe of <hi>Publicola</hi> being the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul: he had this libertie graunted him, that the doore of his house should open outwards into the streete, which was neuer seene in <hi>Rome</hi> before: but the greatnesse of this fauour came from <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Publicola</hi> had the first honours and libertie thereof, and the first <note place="margin">The first fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Rome.</note> funerall sermon that euer was in <hi>Rome,</hi> was made by <hi>Publicola</hi> for <hi>Brutus</hi> his fellow Consul slaine in this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell.

               <p>So the Greekes vsed to honor their dead captaines, to buy condemned murtherers and theeues, to be slain and sacrificed on their graues, to extoll the fame of their <note place="margin">Condemned murtherers. sacrificed on captaines graues.</note> valiant captaines that died in the field: the Greeks were so carefull, that they would not forget the beastes that serued them long.</p>

               <p>And old <hi>Xantippus,</hi> for that his dog swamme by the galleys side from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Salamina,</hi> and died when he landed for very wearinesse, he buried him in the top of a cliffe.</p>
               <p>The Romains in like maner would suffer no draught oxen that ploughed their lands, and carried their fuells to be sold, when they could not plough for age, neither might they in <hi>Athens</hi> by the lawe of <hi>Solon</hi> kill an olde <note place="margin">Alex.

               <p>And therefore <hi>Hannibal</hi> was more detested &amp; hated of his souldiers, that being so cruell and so couetous, he lost not only many of his owne souldiers, but also many of his friends and associates forsooke him.</p>
               <p>And so <hi>Persius</hi> king of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> a most miserable couetous prince, who to spare his money, lost both his <note place="margin">Couetous princes euer lost more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wonne.</note> money, his kingdome, and his life.</p>

               <p>So that <hi>Hanibal</hi> lost (through his couetousnes and crueltie) to the Romains, what he wanne by skill and pollicie of armes of the Romaines.

               <p>I remember <hi>Aristotle</hi> bringeth in a verse of <hi>Homer,</hi> in describing the affection of the desire &amp; wrath of men, and saith, that anger to <hi>Achilles</hi> was as sweete as honey <note place="margin">Achilles wrath.</note> melted vnder his tongue, but the end of his anger and wrath was, that he was slain out of <hi>Greece</hi> in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and to be buried in <hi>Illion.</hi>

               <p>So sweet was couetousnes vnto <hi>Craesus,</hi> being the only wealthiest man in <hi>Rome,</hi> that it brought him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>So to <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> quarrels were as sweet, as reuenge was to <hi>Hanibal,</hi> and therefore taking quarrels in hand euery <note place="margin">Pirrhus quarrels.</note> where, at last was slaine out of his countrey in <hi>Greece.</hi>

               <p>So may it be spoken of the ambition of <hi>Caesar</hi> &amp; <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ambition.</note> the enuie that <hi>Caesar</hi> had to <hi>Alexanders</hi> conquests was so great, that hee much complained of himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an old man, and yet wanne no fame by his smal vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, in respect of <hi>Alexanders</hi> great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quests being but a young man.</p>
               <p>So likewise <hi>Alexander</hi> exclaimed against himselfe, in respect of the fame &amp; greatnes which <hi>Homer</hi> gaue to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles.</hi> Thus ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was as sweet to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> as either wrath to <hi>Achilles,</hi> couetousnesse to <hi>Caesar,</hi> reuenge to <hi>Hanibal,</hi> or quarrels to <hi>Pirrhus.</hi>

Therefore ambition was painted out in <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> a citie in <hi>Egipt,</hi> without legges, because ambition might not clime, for ambitious men are not so glad and proud to see many that follow and obey them, as they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly afflicted and grieued to see fewe not obedient vnto them.</p>
               <p>In the same self citie were the pictures of Iudges pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Iudges.</note> without ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds because they shuld receiue no bribes.</p>
               <p>And the pictures of princes painted blind without eies, <note place="margin">Princes.</note> because they might not see to fauor their friends, and in the midst between these three pictures, was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> picture of <note place="margin">The Image of Iustice painted in Egipt.</note> Iustice painted without a head.

                  <note place="margin">Contention betweene Aiax and Vlisses.</note> was not sorie to see <hi>Crassus</hi> contend with <hi>Pompey</hi> in <hi>Rome.</hi> These men wanted no legges to clime, neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Romaines nor among the Grecians, nor yet among the Iewes.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Athens</hi> a lawe was made against ambitious men, that if any sought singularitie, either by his wisedome, or by his wealth, or by fauour of the people, hee should be banished by the lawe <hi>Ostracismus</hi> out of <hi>Athens,</hi> as <hi>Themistocles</hi> was.</p>
               <p>So ambitious men in <hi>Rome</hi> to get loue and fauour of the people by the lawe called <hi>Lex agraria,</hi> were not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Cai.

               <p>And therfore <hi>Platoes</hi> opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was, that he which began to be ambitious by any secret practise with the enemies, <note place="margin">Platoes opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion against ambitious men.</note> to hurt his country, or made meanes to make warres of

               </p>
               <p>And so <hi>Cato, Marcellus,</hi> and others, perswaded the Senators of <hi>Rome</hi> to deliuer <hi>Caesar</hi> vnto the Gaules, for the like cause, for that they suspected <hi>Caesar</hi> with <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teline,</hi> and euer found him ambitious and desirous of warre, in <hi>Rome,</hi> and out of <hi>Rome:</hi> and therefore ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Generalls and Captaines are euer most dangerous, and most necessary to be lookt vnto.</p>
               <p>The ambition of the Israelites is not to bee passed ouer, as <hi>Absolon</hi> through ambition vnder pretence of iustice went about to take away the hearts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from his father the king, saying often, Oh that I were a Iudge of the land, that I might do iustice to them that haue matters in the lawe, and when any man came to do him obeysance, he tooke him by the hand, and kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">The ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Absolo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Adoniah.</note> him, and thus by degrees stole the hearts of the men of <hi>Israel</hi> from his father.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This is that <hi>Metellus</hi> which caused <hi>Scypio Affrican</hi> to sweare that he would not forsake neither <hi>Rome</hi> nor <hi>Italy</hi> his countrey, which he thought to do with many Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes <note place="margin">Metellus.</note> more, after the great ouerthrow of the Romanes by <hi>Haniball</hi> at the battel of <hi>Canne.</hi> This <hi>Metellus</hi> is that old woman, of which <hi>Sertorius</hi> said, that he had whipt <hi>Pompey Syllas</hi> boy, had not that olde woman <hi>Metellus</hi> comne, which being told <hi>Pompey,</hi> he answered, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be <hi>Syllas</hi> boy then <hi>Syllas</hi> fugitiue, as <hi>Sertorius</hi> is.</p>

               <p>Ambition therefore the secret serpent in euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, as you heard before among the Grecians, <note place="margin">Aristides.</note> among the Israelites, and among the Romanes, and yet in <hi>Athens</hi> there was one <hi>Aristides</hi> that resisted the

               </p>
               <p>But as the Philosopher said, the whole world is a common-wealth of contention, that if strife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention <note place="margin">Licurgus law allowed ambition.</note> had no place in nature, the generation of all things should be at a stay, and therefore ambition and contention was allowed among the Lacedemonians by <hi>Licurgus</hi> lawe, as a spurre to prick them forward to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall actions.</p>
               <p>Among the Athenians they thought it great polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, to keepe men of state in equall authorities, least any should excell, either in greatnesse, wealth, wisedome, honour, or credit among the people, and therefore <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stides</hi> was ioyned in all authorities with <hi>Themistocles,</hi> and <note place="margin">Ambitious men banni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</note>

               </p>
               <p>So likewise among the Romanes, as among the Greekes, nothing was so common as banishment, as in <hi>Athens, Aristides</hi> for his iustice, <hi>Milciades</hi> for his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>Phocion</hi> for his good life, <hi>Socrates</hi> for his vertues, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> for his sound lawes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Themistocles</hi> also being banished by the law of <hi>Ostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cysmus</hi> from <hi>Athens,</hi> went to dwell in <hi>Argos,</hi> from <hi>Argos</hi> he was faine to flye to <hi>Corphu,</hi> &amp; from thence to <hi>Asia,</hi> for <note place="margin">Themistocles banished.</note> the king of <hi>Persia</hi> offered two hundred talents to him that would bring him <hi>Themistocles,</hi> for that <hi>Themistocles</hi> was the onely enemie that destroyed so many Persians in <hi>Greece.</hi>

               <p>After these comparisons betweene the Romaines and the Greekes in all military discipline, it were also fit to compare some of their stratagems.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Darius</hi> king of <hi>Persia,</hi> to escape the daunger by flight which he was in, from the Scythians, vsed a stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem, <note place="margin">Front. lib. 1. cap. 5.</note> left dogges and asses barking and braying in his tents to deceiue the Scythians: which the Scythians supposed by barking &amp; braying of dogges and asses to haue found <hi>Darius</hi> in his tents.</p>
               <p>The like stratagem vsed the Lygurians to escape the hands of the Romanes, who bound diuers wilde oxen and buffes to certaine trees to deceiue the Romaines, which made such a roaring noise, that the Romanes thought therby the Lygurians to be in their campe and in their tents, when they escaped secretly away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> being most busie in plaguing <hi>Italy, Scypio Affrican</hi> vsed a stratagem, passed with a great Romaine <note place="margin">Front. lib. 1. cap. 3.</note> armie to <hi>Affricke,</hi> to drawe <hi>Hannibal</hi> from <hi>Italy:</hi> who was forced streight to follow after to succour the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians.</p>

If the Romanes had bene as desirous of bookes and learning, as they were of bloud and spoile, <hi>Caesar</hi> might as wel haue brought the library fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Alexandria</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> as he brought the pictures of <hi>Cato, Petronius,</hi> and others from <hi>Affrike</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> or as <hi>Augustus</hi> brought the picture of <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>

                  <hi>Lu. Scypio</hi> might as well haue brought vnto <hi>Rome</hi> the library of <hi>Pergamus</hi> from <hi>Asia,</hi> as to bring in long tables painted the forme and likenesse of 130. cities &amp; townes, which he subdued and conquered in <hi>Asia.</hi>

               <p>It was but the opinion of <hi>Cato,</hi> for <hi>Philopomen</hi> the Greeke, by talking of warres with Captaines, and by reading of <hi>Cincius</hi> and <hi>Euangelus</hi> bookes, became an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent captaine.</p>

               <p>This ouerthrow fell iustly to the Lacedemonians, for that they brake their league and conditions of peace with the Thaebans, for the which it is lawfull among all nations to commence warre, so is it great wisedome for all nations to auoyd the great harme that may fall by entreatie of peace.</p>
               <p>For vnder colour of peace many haue practised means to warre: so <hi>Metellus</hi> deceiued <hi>Iugurth</hi> with faire words tending to peace.</p>

               <p>The Romanes in this imitated the Athenians, who entertained the Embassadors of the Lacedemonians in <note place="margin">Oros. li 3. ca. 2</note> like sort, but <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi> were much deceiued, for the cities of <hi>Italy</hi> often rebelled against <hi>Rome,</hi> and the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Greece</hi> against <hi>Athens.</hi>

practising his treachery against the Romane armie, he was bound to two toppes of trees both hands and feete, <note place="margin">Valer. max. lib. 7. cap. 4.</note> and terribly pulled in peeces by the trees.</p>

               <p>The like is read, that the Embassadors of the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians, being sent to the king of <hi>Persia,</hi> to haue his <note place="margin">Theucyd. lib. 2.</note> aide against the Athenians, being in league with the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians, were taken and brought to <hi>Athens,</hi> and by the Athenians slaine.</p>
               <p>The Embassadors of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Macedonia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they did conspire against the Romaines contrary to their league, were taken, and by the law of armes iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly slaine.</p>
               <p>Diuers Embassadors were slaine for breaking theyr leagues against the lawe of armes, as the Embassadors of the Romanes were slaine by the Illyrians, the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the Athenians by the Persians, the Embassadors of the Persians by the Macedonians, the Embassadors of <hi>Dauid</hi> king of <hi>Iudah</hi> by the Ammonites, not slain, but <note place="margin">2.

                  </hi> the king to comfort him for the death of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in kindnes &amp; of good will, but they had halfe their beards shaued, and their garments cut off at their but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks, &amp; thus were they turned back in reproach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thankes to <hi>Dauid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So were the Embassadors of the Romanes without cause against the lawe of armes, most iniuriously slaine by the Illyrians, who were gouerned vnder a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to the great reproach of the Romaines, but the

               <p>Thus euery where trechery and murther was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in all countreys, vnder colour of leagues and lawes broken, and most time without eyther lawe or league, but with violence and trecherie practised by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny false stratagems among all nations.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Zopyrus</hi> practised by a dissembling stratagem to bring the Persians into the hands of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> though some <note place="margin">Zopirus.</note> say it was <hi>Darius,</hi> by cutting &amp; deforming his face, and mangling his body, in this pittiful sort co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to <hi>Babilo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>

               <p>The like stratagem vsed the Grecian <hi>Sinon</hi> for <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> in the warres of <hi>Troy,</hi> therefore <hi>Agamemnon</hi> said, he had rather haue tenne <hi>Nestors,</hi> or tenne <hi>Vlixes,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Aiax</hi> being warned by his olde father <hi>Telamon,</hi> when he went with <hi>Agamemnon</hi> from <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Troy,</hi> to fight valiantly, &amp; to aske at the gods hands good successe and fauour, but <hi>Aiax</hi> more proud then wise, answered his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

that slouthfull men and cowards seeke helpe at <note place="margin">Plyn. lib. 35. cap. 9.</note> Gods handes, but said hee could ouercome without Gods helpe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vlixes</hi> also made claime to <hi>Achilles</hi> armour, saying, that his pollicie and counsell did profit more the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the warres at <hi>Troy,</hi> then the sword of <hi>Aiax.

                  <hi>Nestor</hi> was, he doubted not but soone to subdue <hi>Troy.</hi> So <hi>Cyrus</hi> spake of <hi>Zopirus,</hi> and so <hi>Pirrhus</hi> spake of Romane souldiers, <hi>Plus praestant senes consilio quam inuenes armis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Polymarchies of the earth seeke to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quer another world like <hi>Alexander,</hi> being not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented with one, and couer all the seas with their sailes like <hi>Xerxes,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Philo</hi> might aske a questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aswell now, why the Lord did not ouerthrow the tower of <hi>Babel</hi> with winde, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, and thunderbolts, as he did aske, why the Lord did not destroy <hi>Egipt</hi> with Lyons, Tygres, Beares and such.

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:9244:176"/>
wilde beasts. And so with the like reason <hi>Philo,</hi> or any man for <hi>Philo,</hi> may now answere, that the Lord would not destroy the Tower of <hi>Babel</hi> with tempest and wind to destroy the people, but by diuiding of one tongue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many, that they might acknowledge the Lord to be God, and to confesse their owne folly.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Nimrod</hi> had confessed his sinne, and said I haue <note place="margin">2.

               <p>So <hi>Hannibal</hi> was toucht with that fault by <hi>Hamilcar</hi> the Affrican, that if he had gone forwards and brought his armie after the battell at <hi>Canne</hi> before <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Scipio</hi>

               <p>Nothing abused <hi>Pompey</hi> so much as his owne cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, flattering him, and calling him the great <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon,</hi> king of kings, by <hi>Domitius, Scypio, Spinther,</hi> and <note place="margin">Pompeys pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasites.</note> others, after the victory at <hi>Dyrachium,</hi> assuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues soone to ouerthrow <hi>Caesars</hi> armie, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in brauery for offices at their return to <hi>Rome,</hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lots who should be Consuls, Praetors, Quaestors, or high Bishop, which <hi>Caesar</hi> himselfe was at that time.</p>
               <p>It should seeme that <hi>Pompey</hi> and his captaines, made no doubt of the victory, for when his campe was taken, his tents and pauilions were full of nosegaies, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of mirtle, and their coaches all couered with flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:9244:177"/>
their tables full of bowles of wine, as men more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to doo sacrifice for ioy before the victorie, then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and prepared to fight for the victory, At <hi>Fortuna vitrea cum splendet frangitur?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So also <hi>Tigranes</hi> king of <hi>Armenia,</hi> was flattered with his Leiftenants, Captaines, and other Parasites, who scoffed and flowted the Romanes, they sported and made a May<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> game of <hi>Lucullus</hi> army, some deuiding the spoile, and drawing lots before the battell began, much like to the Cherussians, the Sueuians, and the Sycam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brians, who gathered themselues together in a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they likewise like the Armenians, little esteeming <note place="margin">L.

Thus had they fully concluded before the battel began, but it fell out otherwise, for <hi>Drusus</hi> the Romaine Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ouerthrew them, that their horses, their cattels, <note place="margin">The victory of Drusus.</note> their chaines, their gold and siluer, and they themselues were a spoile and a pray to the Romanes. <hi>Incerti exitus pugnarum &amp; Mars communis</hi> said <hi>Cicero,</hi> it was euer found in all warres, that <hi>Nimia fiducia semper noxia.</hi>

               <p>In like sort the sight of <hi>Milciades</hi> triumphe mooued <hi>Themistocles</hi> in his youth to say, that he could not sleepe in his bed, before he had obtained the like triumph, and so he proued among so many great captaines in <hi>Greece,</hi> one of the greatest, for he was being but a young youth at the battell at <hi>Plataea,</hi> being the first battell and the first <note place="margin">Themistocles celeritie in his victories.</note> victorie that the Grecians had ouer the Persians.

                  <hi>Iacob</hi> likewise was named of the Angell, (with whom hee wrestled) <hi>Israel,</hi> the prince of God.</p>
               <p>So the Hebrewes gaue such significant names of things to come vpon their children, that when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the names of theyr children, they should also remember the thing signified by the name, as <hi>Solomon</hi> was named <hi>Iedidia,</hi> beloued of God, <hi>Iosias</hi> an oblation to the Lord, and so <hi>Ismael</hi> the son of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Agar, Absolon</hi> the sonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and others more, named of the Hebrewes in like manner.</p>
               <p>Women onely gaue names to their children among the Hebrewes, as <hi>Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachel, Iacobs</hi> wiues, named <note place="margin">Wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Israelites gaue names to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> the twelue sonnes of <hi>Iacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Sampson</hi> was named of his mother, and so also was <hi>Samuel</hi> named by his mother, for the Hebrew women gaue such names to their children, as should containe
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:9244:181"/>
something signified by the name, not following the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers name, but one onely name, which the Hebrew women gaue to their children.</p>
               <p>The Romanes had three or foure names common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, contrary to the Hebrewes, and besides three or foure names which were proper vnto them, they would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase as many names as they could get, as <hi>Pub. Cornel. Scypio,</hi> had the fourth name <hi>Affricanuss</hi> for his conquest ouer <hi>Affricke,</hi> and his brother <hi>Lu. Scypio,</hi> was surnamed <hi>Asiaticus,</hi> for the fourth name, because hee subdued <hi>Asia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lu. Q. Metellus,</hi> surnamed <hi>Numidicus,</hi> by his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in <hi>Numidia. Mummius,</hi> for his victories in <hi>Achaia,</hi> surnamed <hi>Achaicus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Romanes being glorious people full of their victories, would possesse as many names as they could haue, and being not contented with so many names, they would haue the moneths of the yeare to be named after their names. So <hi>Iu. Caesar</hi> called the moneth <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis,</hi> after his owne name <hi>Iuly, Augustus</hi> the second Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, <note place="margin">Moneths named after the names of Emperours.</note> called the moneth <hi>Sextilis,</hi> after his name <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So other Emperours imitating them, as <hi>Nero</hi> would haue the moneth of Aprill after his name <hi>Neronius,</hi> and <hi>Domitianus</hi> would haue October named <hi>Domitianus.</hi> Likewise <hi>Claudius</hi> wold haue May called after his name <hi>Claudius:</hi> and <hi>Germanicus</hi> would haue September na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Germanicus</hi> after his name. So the Grecians began to honor <hi>Demetrius</hi> in like sort, in so much they decreed that the month <hi>Manichion</hi> which is Ianuary, shalbe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>De<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>metrion,</hi> and their feast <hi>Dionisia</hi> which was dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> should be called <hi>Demetria,</hi> after <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> name, and that <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and his father king <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus,</hi>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:9244:182"/>
should haue their pictures set vp &amp; carried in the sacred banner of <hi>Peplon,</hi> where none but the picture of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Minerua</hi> were set and placed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clearchus</hi> the tyrant would be called sonne vnto <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> as well as <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, so king <hi>Antigonus,</hi> because hee might be called <hi>Bacchus,</hi> hee resembled <note place="margin">Alex.

               </p>
               <p>The Greekes also, most commonly had but one name, vnlesse he had a name added vnto it, either by some vertue or vice noted in him: as <hi>Pericles</hi> for his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and sweete perswasion, was surnamed <hi>Olympius. Aristides</hi> for his integritie, surnamed the iust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antigonus</hi> for his liberalitie was surnamed <hi>Doson,</hi> and <note place="margin">The sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names of great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls and Captaines in Greece.</note> yet reported in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that hee promised any thing, and performed nothing.</p>
               <p>So likewise the Greekes named those that had any blemish on their bodies, as <hi>Antiochus</hi> surnamed <hi>Griphos</hi> for his great belly.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>Antigonus</hi> surnamed <hi>Gonatos,</hi> for that hee had great knees. <hi>Demetrius,</hi> surnamed <hi>Polycrates,</hi> for his inuention and skill of warlike engines as <hi>Elepolis,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as famous welnigh as <hi>Archimedes:</hi> otherwise the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians vsed but one name.</p>
               <p>And although <hi>Agesilaus</hi> was a great souldier, for skil and knowledge in warre so famous, that hee was sent from <hi>Egipt</hi> vnto <hi>Greece,</hi> for to be their Generall, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so among the Persians so feared, and among the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans so esteemed, and yet hee was called but <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> without any surname of addition among the Grecians, neither other great captaines of <hi>Greece,</hi> as <hi>Milciades, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles, Cymon,</hi> and others, had no such surnames by their victories as the Romanes had.</p>

               <p>The surnames of the last kings of <hi>Egipt</hi> began from a souldiers name, who grew so great among the Egipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that he strengthened and established the countrey, being subdued and ouerthrowne before by the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that the Alexandrians so hououred him after his <note place="margin">Alex.

               </p>
