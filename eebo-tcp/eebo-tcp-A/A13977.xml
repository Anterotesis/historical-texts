            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For (to omit other things, wherof this tyme and matter serueth not to speake) it is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen to others, and I haue had experience therof myself, howe earnest a desire your honor hath natu rally graffed in you, to read, peruse, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with others, as well the Histories of auncient tyme, and thynges done long ago, as also of the present e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of thinges in oure dayes, and that not withoute a certayn pregnancie of witte and rypenesse of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandyng: The which do not only now reioyse the hartes of all such as beare faithfull affection to tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable

house of your auncestours, but also stirre vp a greate hope and expectacion of such wysedom and experience in you in time to come, as is mete and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semyng for so noble a race. To the furthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wher of (because I will not be ouer taedious in wordes) I will briefly propound vnto your L. no mo but twoo examples, which are mencioned among many other of like purport in this boke. Thone is of the valiant Epaminondas Prince of Thebe, who beyng an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Captayn and politike in all Martial feates and warlike affaires, was neuerthelesse so well lerned, that it was a wonder to se howe a man bredde, and broght vp in Philosophy, should come by such know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in feates of Armes, or howe a man accustomed to the licentious libertie of the Campe, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne suche exquisite knowledge in Philosophie, with vnspotted innocencie of lyuynge and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacion: whose fortune was suche (by the consente of all wryters) that the strength, the glory, and the re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nowme of his countrie, dyd bothe ryse with him and dye with him. Thother example is of Arymba kyng of Epyre, who beyng very yong at the decease of his father, was by the aduise and consente of the whole Realme, duryng his nouage, sente to Athenes to be enstructed in Learnyng and in Phylosophie. At hys returne then into his owne Realme agayne,
<pb facs="tcp:19141:5"/>
he chose him a sage and graue counsell, created offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, made good lawes, abrogated euil customes, and finally so stablished the state of the common welthe, that he semed to haue made the Realme new. And looke howe much he was better lerned then his aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cestors, so much the story reporteth him to haue ben the better beloued and honoured of his subiects. Let these and such other examples (where your L. shall fynde store in this worke) encourage youre tender yeres, runnyng in the renoumed fotesteppes of your famous auncestours, to procede in learning and ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue (which are thonly ornamentes of nobilitie, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the very true nobilitie it self,) i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such sort as you may be able to doe acceptable seruice to your Prince and your countrie, Your Prince and your countrie for your weldoyngs embrace you and esteme you as a Iewell, and Yourself thereby become equall to any of your worthye Predecessours in aduauncyng tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of your noble house: wherof as your greate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse geueth assured hope and expectacion, so I moste hartely beseche Almighty God to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, augment, establish, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the same in your L. with thabundaunce of his grace.</p>

All others, like as they did at the sumptuous feast, when al thynges prouoke them, beynge able neyther in their owne lyfe, nor yet in another mannes at any time to fynd what is best to folow, or howe to procede. But if nature haue geuen any thyng to man, the whiche he maye vse or abuse at hys pleasure, certesse he ought most circumspectely to vse this. But I pray you what man is there almost, that applyenge the rule of vertue vnto all sayenges and doynges, aswell of his owne as of other mennes, doth with more aduisement aduenture vpon them, then vpon the daintye dishes, set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him on the table: or which thynketh not hym selfe suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently learned in this behalfe? In the whiche thinge it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonder to see, howe sore men deceyue them selues, whiles they imagine that the bare hystory, is of it self able enough to enstruct the reader, whereas in dede it doth no more but minister matter to learne vpon, offeryng it selfe to all vses accordynge as the person is affectioned, in lyke case as doth the feast. For some we see haue none other delyght but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the reading, who sekyng no more but that only one de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lectation, do loose all thother goodly and pleasaunte fruites thereof.

For it is no pleasure that hath no respect vnto ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.

And although that none but fooles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will go about to aspire to the lyke glorye without the like vertue, yet notwithstanding we see some, which for none other cause but that they haue read the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actes of others, do thinke them selues hyghe wyse men, and take muche vppon theym, lyke vnto players of Trage<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dies, whiche when they haue put of thapparell, wherein they played the partes of moste noble personage, do also counterfeyte them in countenance and behauiour. There are also, and those not a fewe, whyche delyghte onelye in strannge thinges and wonders, menne of vulgare and rude vnderstandynge, who after the maner of thunskylfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, oftentimes make more of a mannes gaye cote, than of the person him selfe, and more of the outwarde shewe than of the worke. So wonderfull a power hath an Historye, to worke in the mindes of the Readers. Nowe, whereas it is the chiefest poynt that belongeth to an Historye, to styrre vp the minde of man from slouthfulnesse, and to fence it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste all daungers: and that the strengthe of examples, (then the whych there is nothynge of greater force to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade and disswade) inespecially tendeth to that ende and purpose, it commeth to passe through the carelesse securitye of men, (beleuing that other mennes perilles perteyne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng to them selues) that such thinges as are most worthy of remembraunce, are hearde and reade with deaffe and stopped eares. Finallye there be (whiche a man woulde not beleue) that transgresse euen agaynst the very same parte, that conteineth most graue and serious matters as though thinges should be wrytten, not as they were done in dede, but as they ought to haue bene done. Therefore partely by meanes of that careles securitye, and partlye by meanes of that surfet of rashe and vnaduised readynge, it commeth to passe, that euen as it were of corrupt humours, a certayne

            <p>I thinke you maye now perceyue, howe the maner of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng Hystories, and of looking vpon a mannes lyfe, is well nye all one. And the greatest difficultie is this. I mean the peruersenesse of our owne iudgement, which causeth vs to be driuen, not that way that the examples oughte to beare greatest sway of them selues, but that way that our mynde is moste enclined and bent vnto. This is also another, and of no lesse force than thother aforesayde, that writeth do in such wise set forth things, that they not only seke to be wel liked, but also (folowing as it were the taste of their owne mouthes) lyke as they were forgers of it them selues, geue theyr iudgement and verdite vppon matters, extollynge some thynges with hygh commendacions, as though they would haue all other men to like those thinges, which they most fancied them selues. The which thing, yf so be it they dyd it without colour, it were easier to consente or dissente the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>refro. But nowe in lykewise, as Cookes haue oftenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes more regard to the belly, then to their maysters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie and profite: euen so I would God that the wryters of Hystories, for the most part, sought not so muche to please and entice the Reader. Therefore by two meanes are wee led awrye: that is to saye, by our owne iudgement, and by the forespeakyng of the writers, as by them that write not matters playnely and sincerely. For an Historiographer is but an interpretour of thinges done: with whose iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (it there be any fault therein) it standeth in like case, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a piece of wine, that of it selfe beinge good, pleasaunte, and beawtifull, doth eyther take an euill talent of the Caske, or els is other wyse marred, by minglyng some other thynge with yt, the whiche is eyther a shamefull and intollerable

               </gap>, or els a poynt of extreme folly and ignoraunce. It ys to be sene by this one example, what matter the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wryter maketh. A man of rawe aduisement, that attributeth the bryngyng to passe of great matters to mannes pollicie, although that by the determinacion of so many thinges, he prove him selfe a lyar, yet he casteth men into a great follye: as whose knowledge (do the beste they can) beyng scarse able to wey and consider accordinglye, the thinges that lye before theyr eyes, theyr power and stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth not much excedyng the litle wormes, because of one prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous successe, rashely taketh vppon it the rule of the whole world. But such a man as is otherwyse enformed, teaching that thinges are in deede put in execution by the pollicye of man, but yet ruled and gouerned by the prouidence of God deliuereth men both from folly, and also from another mis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chiefe as great as that, whiche is supersticion. By the resy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, such as be good men (whose study is altogether employ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed about matters apperteynyng to God) oughte to knowe what difference there is betwene eche of theym, and what theyr dutye is. I geue this warning first of all for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that forasmuch as I am of opinion, that suche kinde of Authours are to be read, and yt were for nothynge els but for the great aboundeunce of examples that they entreate of, yong men should also thinke this, howe circumpectelye and carefully they ought to be read, consideryng how great fruytes or discommodities are in them propounded. For it happeneth in lyke case to such as ymagine that in Hystorys may be read ouer lightly, or the life to be passed ouer vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly, without thexacte obseruing and executyng of a man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes duetye: as it doth to men of the countrey, whyche in the sackyng of a citie come to the ryffling of some Apothecaries of Grocers shoppe, plenteouslye furnyshed with al thynges belongyng to the crafte, and beyng allured with the swete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the confections and spices which they chaunce first to laye their handes on, thynking all the residue to be of the same sorte, do eate suppe, deuour, cramme in, and lycke vp

As for learning was a like in both of them. The father was a man of more craft and pollicye, but the sonne was more to be betrusted.

Wherfore it was good for antiochus to take ensample how to beware by other men, whose kingdome the nobler and nearer it was to the Romaines, so muche should he finde them his fiercer enemies.

            <p>Therfore he saw suche a cloude of cruel and bloudye war rising out of Italy, he saw suche a roring and thundering storme comming out of the west, that into what parte of the world so euer the violent force of the victorye shoulde driue the tempest therof, it was like to washe all thinges with a terrible and bloudy shour. He said that Grece had oftentimes before suffered great trouble by the war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If those armyes which now were fighting in Italye, shoulde once spreade them selues into Grece. For he sawe well inoughe, howe cruell and bloudy bothe with puissaunce of hostes and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licye of captaines, those two peoples made warre one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another.

Wherefore Grece had more cause a greate deale to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the cruelty of whether party so euer gate the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand, then Macedone, both because Macedone is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of from them, and of more strength to defend it self. And yet he knew for a certaintye that those that encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered now with so great puissaunce, would not be conten ted to end their conquest so, but that he himself shuld haue cause to sear, least he be driuen to haue to doo with them that should get the vpper hand.
