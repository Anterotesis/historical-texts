         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

conclusions as are usually wrought

may be seen, and in others that have written in the

               <p>An Example in Numbers like his 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Prop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As 15 to 5, So 7 to what?</p>
               <p>Here, because the second terme is lesse than the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34351:6"/>
first, upon the line AB, I set AC the first terme
15, and AD the second terme 5, both taken out of
the Scale of equall parts. Thence also the third
number 7 being taken, with it (upon the center C)
I describe the arke EF, and from A, draw the line
AE, which may only touch that same arke. Then
from D, I take DG, the least distance from the
line AE, and the same measured in the same Scale
of equall parts, gives 2 ½, the fourth terme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.
<figure/>
               </p>
               <p>But if your second terme shall be greater than
the first, then the form of working must be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
as in this Example.</p>
               <p>As 5 to 15, So 20 to what?</p>
               <p>Upon the line AB, I set the second terme 15,
which here suppose to be AD: then with the first
terme 5, upon the center D, I describe the arke GH,
and draw AG that may just touch it. Again, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken 20 the third term, out of the same Scale,
I set one foot of that extent upon the line AB, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
it till it fall into such a place, as that the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34351:6"/>
other foot being turned about will justly touch the
line AG before drawn, and where (upon such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions)
it resteth, I make the point C. Then mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
AC upon your Scale, you shall finde it to
reach 60 parts, which is the fourth number re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p>The form of work (though not so Geometricall)
is here given because it is more expedite than the
other by drawing parallel lines. But in some pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises,
the other may be used.</p>
               <p>I have been the more large upon this, because the
solutions of proportions which follow must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
hither, the forme of their operations being the

(beginning at the middle of these two last mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
to serve for Chords of severall extents, if you
count each halfe degree for a whole degree, and so
double all the numbers, accounting 10 to be 20;
and 30 to be 60, 45 to be 90, &amp;c. By this you
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34351:7"/>
are fitted with severall Scales of Chords which are
of different lengths, and may be used, each of them,
as occasion shall require. And (by the way) the
Versed Scale being taken for Chords, it will be of
the same Radius or length with the Sines, Tangents
and Secants and so will protract Angles to a Circle
of their Radius, which is usefull in Projections, and
many other things: and so the little Scale of 60
Chords might be spared.</p>

               <p>BY these two together, may be resolved all
Cases in Plaine Triangles without proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
work, if the three quantities given be
protracted by help of these two Scales. For their
principall uses are to measure lines and angles.</p>
               <p>Here must be remembered. First, that if the three
angles alone be given, then will the proportions on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the sides be found, but not the sides themselves.
Secondly, that if two angles be known, then is the
third also known; because it is the residue of the
sum of the other two to 180 <hi>gr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One case which is of frequent use may here be
given for an example. In mensurations of distances
of places (as Towns or Forts) there are usually two
stations taken as A and B, whose distance AB
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34351:7"/>
suppose known, 300 feet, and the two angles adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
at A 105 <hi>gr.</hi> at B 60 <hi>gr.</hi> known also by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.
To finde the other sides, draw AB, and
upon it set 300 being taken from the Scale of equall
parts.
<figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Then with a line of Chords protract the angles
at A and B according to their known quantities, so
shall the two legges of the same angles meet at C:
And if the length AC be taken and measured upon
your Scale of equall parts, the same will shew about
1004, intimating that C is from A 1004 feet. So
again BC being measured in the same Scale will
give 1120; shewing that from B to C are about
1120 feet.</p>
               <p>In this manner may perpendicular altitudes (as
of Towers or such like) be measured, though no
accesse can be had to them; and that much better
than by the Geometricall Square. For it is not
here requisite that the ground whereon the mensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is made, should be levell, as if you work by
the Square it is most commonly required; neither
are you tyed to right angled Triangles here, as there
you are. As for example,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:34351:8"/>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>If one station be at A, and the other at B, you
may, by the precedent work get the distance AD.
Then (standing at A) observe the altitude of C, the
complement of that altitude gives the angle ACD.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34351:8"/>
And again from A, if you observe the altitude of D,
the difference of these two altitudes observed, gives
the angle CAD. Or if D had appeared lower
then your station, then the summe of your two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
altitudes had made the angle CAD. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
you have now the three angles and side AD;
you may therefore, by help of them, finde the
length of CD.</p>
               <p>In such manner may all cases in plain <hi>Trigonome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>

projection.</head>
                  <p>A Sea-chart may be made either generall or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;
I call that a generall Sea-chart, whose
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34351:10"/>
line AE, in the following figure, represents the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall,
as the line AE there doth the parallel of
50 <hi>gr.</hi> and so containeth all the parallels successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the Equinoctiall towards either Pole:
but they can never be extended very neere the
Pole because the distances of the parallels increase
so much, as the Secants doe. But notwithstanding
this, it may be termed generall, because that a more
generall Chart cannot be contrived in <hi>plano,</hi> except
a true Projection of the Sphere it selfe. And I
call that a particular Chart which is made properly
for one particular Navigation, as if a man were to
sail between the Latitude of 50 and 55 <hi>gr.</hi> and his
difference of Longitude were not to exceed 6 <hi>gr.</hi>
then a Chart made (as the figure following is) for
such a Voyage, may be called particular.</p>
                  <p>Now the making of such a Chart, is Master
<hi>Gunters</hi> first proposition page 104 of the Sector, and
this the line of Secants will sufficiently perform.</p>
                  <p>For it were required to project such a Chart:
Having drawn the line AB, and having crossed it
at right angles with another line AE, representing
the parallel of 50 <hi>gr.</hi> you must then take the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
of 51 from your Scale, and set it from 50 to
51 on both sides the Chart, and draw the parallel
51 51.</p>
                  <p>Again, take the Secant of 52 from your Scale,
and set it upon your Chart from 51 to 52, and so
draw the parallel 52 52. And so you are to draw
the rest of the parallels.</p>
                  <p>Then for the Meridians, or divisions of the line
BC, they are all equall to the Radius.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34351:10"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:34351:11"/>
If therefore you take the Radius, and run it above
and below, you shall make the spaces or distances
of the Meridians such as in the bottome of the Chart
are figured with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>These degrees thus set on the Chart, may be
sub-divided into equall parts, which in the gradua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
above and below ought so to be. But in the
graduations upon the sides of the Chart, they ought
as they goe higher, still to grow greater. Yet the
difference is so small that it cannot produce any
considerable errour, though the sub-divisions be all
equall. Divide them therefore either into 60 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
or English miles, or into 20 leagues, or into
100 parts of degrees, as shall best be liked of.</p>
                  <p>It a little more curiosity should be stood upon for
the graduations of the Meridian, instead of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants
of 51, 52, 53, &amp;c. you may take 50½, 51½,
52½, &amp;c. alwayes halfe a degree lesse than is the
Latitude that should be put in.</p>
                  <p>Now if each of those divisions at the bottome
of the Chart, as A 1, &amp;c. be made equall to the
common Radius of the Sines, Secants, and Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
and if a Chart be made to that extent upon a
skin of smooth Velame; well pasted on a board; you
may work upon it many conclusions very exactly.</p>

upon the center C describe the fundamentall Circle
ZHNO representing the Meridian, and draw the

diameter HO for the Horizon, and ZCN at right
angles thereto, ZN being the <hi>Zenith</hi> and <hi>Nadir</hi>

Z to E, and from N to Q, drawing the line ECQ
for the Equinoctiall, and at right angles thereto, the

set it from C to G. Likewise, take 20 <hi>gr.</hi> (the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination)

distance upon the Meridian from E unto D, and
from Q unto K: then describe the arke of a Circle

the center whereof will alwayes fall in the line CP
if it were extended, and this arke DGK shall be

out of the line of Tangents, and set that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

the Meridian from H unto A, and from O unto B,
drawing the arke AFB, the center whereof will fall

the arke of a circle which shall passe through the

and of the parallels of altitude, may readily
be fouud by the Scale it selfe; as in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
having found the point F upon the

take therefore out of your Scale the Secant

and set that distance from C to I, so shall

               <p>TO effect this, there are required two obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations:
the first is of the Horizontall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Sun from the pole of the plain,
the second is of the Suns Altitude, thereby to get
the Azimuth. And these two observations must be
made at one instant of time, as neer as may be, that
the parts of the work may agree together the better.</p>
               <p>1 For the horizontall distance of the Sun from
the pole of the plain: Apply one edge of a Quadrant
to the plain, so that the other may be perpendicular
to it, and the limbe may be towards the Sun, and
hold the whole Quadrant horizontall as neer as you
can conjecture: Then holding a threed and plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
at full liberty, so that the shadow of the threed
may passe through the center and limbe of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant,
observe then the degrees cut off by the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of the threed, and number them from that side
of the Quadrant that standeth square to the plain,
for those degrees are the distance required.</p>
               <p>2 At the same instant observe the Altitude of
the Sun, these two will help you to the plains de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
by the rules following.</p>
               <p>First, By having the Altitude, you may finde
the Azimuth by the 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> of the 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> then by
comparing the Azimuth and distance together, you
may finde the plains declination in this manner.</p>
               <p>When you make your observation of the Suns
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34351:22"/>
horizontall distance, marke whether the shadow of
the threed fall between the South and that side of
the Quadrant which is perpendicular to the plain.
For,</p>
               <p>1. If the shadow fall between them, then the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and Azimuth added together, do make the
declination of the plain, and in this case, the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
is upon the same coast whereon the Suns A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimuth
is.</p>
               <p>2. If the shadow fall not between them, then
the difference of the distance and Azimuth is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of the plain, and if the Azimuth be the
greater of the two, then the plain declineth to the
same Coast whereon the Azimuth is: Otherwise,
if the distance be the greater then the plain declineth
to the contrary Coast to that whereon the Suns A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimuth
is.</p>
               <p>¶Note here further, that the Declination so
found is alwayes accounted from the South,
and that all Declinations are numbred from
either South or North towards either East
or West, and must not exceed 90 <hi>gr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. If therefore the number of declination ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
90, you must take the residue of that number to
180 <hi>gr.</hi> and the same shall be the declination of the
plain from the North.</p>
               <p>2. If the number of declination doe exceed
180 <hi>gr.</hi> then the excesse above 180 gives the plains
declination from the North, towards that Coast
which is contrary to the Coast whereon the Sun is.</p>

¶And here note, that wheresoever in this
Chapter the use of a Quadrant is required,
the Scale of Chords will effect the same; if
upon a piece of plain board you describe a
Quadrant, whose sides may be parallel to
the edges of the board, upon which you
may set off the Horizontall distance and

make AH equall to the co-sine of your Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and draw H6 parallel to AB; which will cut
AG in the point noted with 6. To this A6, let
A6 also beyond the center be made equall, and then
draw the lines 12 6 and 12 6, which lines must
have the houre points set upon them; and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
that worke doe thus.</p>
               <p>Draw upon paper, or some other plaine, the line
LM, upon which set LR and RM, each of them
equall to your Tangent of 45 <hi>gr.</hi> Then make RN
equall to the Tangent of 30, and RO equall to the
Tangent of 15, so shall you have points to finde all
the houres, and if you desire halves and quarters, you
must also put their Tangents into the same line RM.
Being thus prepared, if you would divide the lesser
line 12 6 into its requisite parts, take the same
line in your Compasses, and with it, upon L as a
center describe the arke PQ, and from M draw
MP, which may only touch the same arke. Then
from N take the least distance to the line MP, and
the same will reach from 12 to 11, and from 6 to 7;
so the least distance from O to the line MP, will
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34351:23"/>
give from 12 to 10, and from 6 to 8. And the least
distance from R will reach from 12 or 6 to 9.</p>
               <p>In the same manner you must divide the larger
line 12 6. Take it out of your Diall, and with
it describe the arke ST from the same center L,
and draw MS touching only the same arke. Then
the least distances from N, O, R, to the line MS,
will give the points or distances 12 1; 6 5; and
12 2; 6 4; and 12 3; or 6 3. These upon the
South-decliner; the like may be done upon the
North-decliner. Lastly, from the center A, through
these points you must draw the Houre-lines.</p>

               <p>FOr the Horizontall plains in speciall, there is
a peculiar Scale by which the houres may so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
be described, to any Latitude between
30 and 60 degrees.</p>
               <p>The manner of which work is easie. For you
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34351:26"/>
have the numbers from 30 to 60 five times repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
serving for the five houres in so many Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.
Suppose then a Horizontall Diall were to
be described for the Latitude of 51½ <hi>gr.</hi> First, by the
Radius (which is from the beginning of the line to
R) describe a Circle, and draw the line of 12 from
the center. Then take from the beginning of the
line to VI, and set it in the Circle both wayes from
12, these two are the points of the two sixes. Again
out of the same Scale take the length from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to 51½ in the remotest numbers, and set that
upon the Circle on both sides 12, these are the
points of 5 and 7. So from the beginning of the
Scale to 51½ in the next remotest numbers, being
set as the other were, will give the points of 4 and 8.
The third 51½ will give the points of 3 and 9. And
the fourth gives 2 and <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>0. The last gives 1 and 11.</p>

               <p>The Meridian line is not here to be taken for the
line of 12 at mid-day (for it often represents the
mid-night) but for that part which helps to describe
the Diall.</p>
               <p>1. The first thing to be done upon these plains,
is (by some levell) to draw the Horizontall, and
then the Verticall line perpendicular thereto.</p>
               <p>2. Next is the placing of the Meridian upon the
plain, in a true position. In direct plains that
re / in-cline, and in upright decliners, the Meridian is
the same with the plains Verticall line. In East and
West re / in-cliners, it is the same with the horizontall
line. In the rest, it ascendeth or descendeth from
the horizontall line, and must be placed according
to the rules hereafter given.</p>
               <p>3. For which purpose, In the Circle FZFN (made
of the same Radius with that of Sines and Tangents,

each equall to your Poles altitude. Then count
the Reclination or Inclination from Z downwards,
towards P if it be North, towards AE if it be South;
and there set B. Then proceed by one of these two
wayes.

4. For that which follows, take notice of these
four things. First, That from D to the neerest
AE (measured by the line of Chords) gives the new
Latitude, in which the re / in-clining plain, is an upright
declining plain. Secondly, That OR (measured
upon the line of Sines) gives the complement of
the plains new declination in that new Latitude:
this New declination is to the same Coast with the
Old, but alwayes lesse in quantity than it. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That DS (measured upon the Sines) gives the
quantity of the Meridians ascension or descension.
This gives the quantity, the former rules gave the
Coast. Fourthly, That in the description of the
Diall, you must only make use of the new Latitude,
and new Declination: having nothing to doe with
the other.</p>
               <p>5. Having the former things known, you must
(by the Tangent and co-tangent of the new Latitude)
describe your Rectangled Parallelogram (as in the
10 <hi>Chap.)</hi> and according as the plain was discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be a decliner from the North or South, you
must make choice of your center, place the substylar,
style, and six a clock line, by help of the Sine and
co-sine of the new declination, and new Latitude,
and then prick down and draw the houres, all in the
same form that was before shewed in the 10 <hi>Chap.</hi>
for upright decliners.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>This for the Dials description.</head>
                  <p>6. Lastly, for placing your Diall. First, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
which way, and how much, your Meridian
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34351:31"/>
ascended or descended from the horizontall line.
Then goe to your plain, and there draw the same
Meridian line answerably, setting off so many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
by your Scale of Chords. When this is
done, take your paper description, and lay the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian
of it, either upon, or else parallel to, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian
drawn upon the plain, and take care to place
it the right way; namely so, as that the imaginary
style of your paper (or a reall pattern of the style
cut fit and set upon the paper Diall) may point into
the North or South Pole, according as the plain is
esteemed to be a North or South plain. After this
is performed, you may transfer each houre from
the paper to the plain, and so finish all the work.</p>

notice, that the new Latitude (wherein they

the point S or R. Then upon your Scale of
Tangents, count the numbers 7 08, 22 08, &amp;c.
in the Table, and take them off from the same Scale,
setting them severally from S to <hi>a, b, c, d, e.</hi> So
again, upon the same Scale of Tangents count the
other numbers, 7 52, 22 52, 37 52, &amp;c. and
take them off thence severally, and place them from
Sat <hi>f, g, h, i.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:34351:36"/>
After this, take 45 <hi>gr.</hi> out of your Tangent Scale,
and place it upon this line from S to K both wayes.
Then (as in the 19 <hi>Chap.)</hi> take the least distance
<figure/>
from the point S (in
your Diall) to GH
the fiduciall edge of
your style, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
one foot of that
extent upon K, with
the other describe
the arke MP, and
from S draw the
lines SP only touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the said arks.
Being thus fitted,
you must from <hi>a, b,
c, d, e,</hi> take the least
distances to the line
LP, and set them
(respectively) upon
the contingent line
of your Diall, from
S to 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
And again, the least
distances from <hi>f, g,
h, i,</hi> to the line PS,
will give the poins
6, 5, 4, 3, upon the
same contingent line
of your Diall. Thus
is one of the contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
lines divided
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34351:36"/>
into his requisite houres. The like work must be
done with the other. For you must take the least
distance from the point R (in your Diall) to GH the
fiduciall edge of your style, and setting one foot of
that extent upon K, with the other describe the arke
TV, and draw the touch-line SV. Then from
<hi>a, b, c, d, e,</hi> take the least distance to SV, and set
them on your Diall from R to 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
So from <hi>f, g, h, i,</hi> take the least distances, and set
them from R to 6, 5, 4, 3, by which means you
have the other contingent line divided into its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
hours. The rest of the work for finishing
the Diall will be the same with that in the 17 <hi>Chap.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But because the tangents upon the Scale goe but
to 63 <hi>gr.</hi> 26', it must therefore here be shewed
how those that exceed that quantity may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.
Namely thus, Double the number of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and minutes, and from the sum take 90 <hi>gr.</hi>
so shall the Tangent and Secant of the remaining
arke (both of them put together) give the Tangent
required. As if in the former example, it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to finde the Tangent of 67 <hi>gr.</hi> 8' noted upon
the line by the length S <hi>e,</hi> we must doe thus. The
double of 67 <hi>gr.</hi> 8' is 134 <hi>gr.</hi> 16', from which take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
90 <hi>gr.</hi> the remainder will be 44 <hi>gr.</hi> 16'. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
we must first take the Secant of 44 <hi>gr.</hi> 16',
and set it from S to y; then take the Tangent of the
same 44 <hi>gr.</hi> 16'. and set it also forward from <hi>y</hi> to <hi>e,</hi>
so shall you have S <hi>e</hi> the whole Tangent of 67 <hi>gr.</hi>
8'. as is required. Thus doe for any other which
shall goe beyond the Scale.</p>
