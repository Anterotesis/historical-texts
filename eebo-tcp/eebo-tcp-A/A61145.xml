         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE City of <hi>Geneva</hi> being one of the moſt
Conſiderable of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> party, we
may eaſily believe there is none but will
deſire to know its Hiſtory; ſome, that they may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the State of that City with which they are link<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Religion; others, that they may not be ignorant
of the ſtrength and policy of a State which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
as an enemy. Hitherto we have had but ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
fragments, as in the Hiſtory of <hi>Savoy</hi> or
<hi>Switzerland,</hi> and in the Book called the <hi>Cavaleer
Savoyard,</hi> and in the <hi>Genevoiſe Citizen;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in theſe Hiſtorical Relations there is ſo much of
ſharpneſs and paſſion, that a man ſhall ſcarce know
when to credit any thing.</p>
            <p>This I have endeavoured to avoid to the utmoſt
of my power, though it be very difficult when it
concerns the Religion of People and the pretenſions
of Princes, to keep ſuch a juſt moderation as ſhall
provoke neither Party: Yet I am apt to think I
have done as much in this matter as could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
For as to the main of this Hiſtory, if all
people ſhall not find ſatisfaction, I ſhall look upon
this only as a misfortune uſually attending ſuch ſort
of Writings, and not as an effect of my paſſion: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I have followed as much as in me lay the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
given of old to an Hiſtorian, not to be of any
Country or Party whileſt the Pen was in his hand.
<pb facs="tcp:50836:3"/>
It is true, I wanted ſeveral things requiſite to a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of this nature, but on the other ſide I know
full well, there is no one could acquit himſelf better
in this affair than my ſelf: ſeeing that a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiſe</hi>
would be ſure to be ſuſpected, and a ſtranger
could not be ſo well informed of thoſe things which
I have known, and procure thoſe Memoires and
Manuſcripts which I have by me, for which both
the Publick and my ſelf are obliged not a little to
M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſieur <hi>Chorier</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Kings Hiſtorian
and Advocate in the Parliament of <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> who
long ſince hath been urgent with me to follow this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign:
and had it not been for him, I ſhould not ſo much
as have thought of it. Certainly no one could have
better performed this, than my Noble Friend; for
having Written ſo Excellent an Hiſtory of <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiné,</hi>
with which our Libraries are adorned; this
here would have been but an eaſie task to him, would
he have undertaken it, and his affairs had permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him. The Manuſcripts with which he hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
me, are <hi>three Volumes in Quarto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> taken
out of the Library of the deceaſed Monſieur <hi>James
Godefroy (Jacobus Gothofredus)</hi> famous for his
<hi>Commentary</hi> on the <hi>Theodoſian Codex:</hi> they
plainly appear to he Written with his own hand,
and I do not believe there is any other Copy to be
found of them: (precious Remains) of the Cloſet
of this great Man; and which ought to be rankt
immediately after the famous <hi>Commentaries</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.
And being made Counſellor and Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dick
of <hi>Geneva,</hi> his want of leiſure, and other
reaſons of State withheld him from publiſhing his
<hi>Memoires</hi> as he had deſigned. I have had more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<pb facs="tcp:50836:3"/>
of Monſieur <hi>Chorier</hi> another Manuſcript, of
which I know not the Author. I have likewiſe
made uſe of ſome Chronological Manuſcripts of one
<hi>Roſet</hi> which are in every bodies hands: not to
reckon other Collections, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Acts and Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
with <hi>Switzerland</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> and the
Printed Books as many as I could find, ſuch as
<hi>Paradins</hi> Hiſtorical Chronicle of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the
Hiſtory of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the <hi>Genevois</hi> Citizen,
and <hi>Pictet</hi>'s Harangue, the Sieur de <hi>Juſſie</hi>'s
Book intitled the <hi>Leven of Calviniſm, More</hi>'s
Harangues, <hi>Spanheim</hi>'s and ſeveral others. Theſe
are the Materials from whence I have taken my Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory;
which I have more need to abridge than am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie,
leſt I ſhould exceed the bounds of a particular
Hiſtory, by introducing a thouſand accidents which
have hapned in the neighbouring Countries, or even
in all <hi>Europe.</hi> I have added alſo of my own at the
end of this Hiſtory, thoſe ancient Inſcriptions
which are to be ſeen at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and thoſe of S.
<hi>Peter</hi>'s Chanons, with all poſſible exactneſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

though I cannot pleaſe the Criticks, who love to try
their Wits, and value not a Book unleſs its periods are
laboured and ſmoothed to the utmoſt exactneſs, and

mean State, conſidering its ſmall Extent and
Compaſs, and the little Noiſe which it hath
made in the World, yet my deſign to publiſh
it, cannot be juſtly blam'd, ſeeing God himſelf
is no leſs admirable in the ſmall works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
than in the great, where the matter is
faſhion'd by his hands: neither is he leſs won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
in the Government of ſmall States, than great Kingdoms; as
a Pilot ſhews no leſs skill in reſiſting with a little Bark a Tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sea, than in preſerving a great Ship in the midſt of a Storm.</p>
               <p>You muſt not expect here magnificent deſcriptions of Glorious
Actions, Eloquent <hi>Harangues</hi> of Famous Generals, or Battels fought
by infinite numbers of Soldiers; but inſtead of this, at every turn,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50836:5"/>
ſome Miracle of Providence, ſome Hiſtorical or Political paſſage
worth your conſideration: In this Scene will appear Actors, who,
although they are not array'd in the gliſtering Attare of Princes, nor
ſpeak big, as Kings of the Earth on the ſpacious Theatres of their
Dominions; yet do they not fail to act that part they have taken
upon them, and to ſet before us excellent inſtructions, which
are ſo much the more profitable, as they are every mans concern:
for every man is either a Soldier, or Citizen of his Countrey. There
you'l ſee examples of all kinds of Vertues and Vices; which will
not be uſeleſs, if you mind not ſo much him that ſpeaketh, as what
he ſaith, whether it be to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>For my part, I ſhall not be ſo ſolicitous after ſmoothneſs in my
ſtyle, as after truth in my relations; and ſhall endeavour that no
paſſion ſhall make me unworthy the name of an Hiſtorian, who ought
chiefly to be a Secretary to Truth, and not to Falſhood or Flattery.
He who writes to ſhew his Eloquence, publiſheth rather his own
Hiſtory, than that of the States or Perſons, whom he pretends to
write of: and it often happens, that ſuch a one climbs upon the
Scaffold of his Vanity, that he may make himſelf the more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and have the greater fall. Truth hath no need of Varniſh, or
any affected dreſs, to make it lovely; and provided it be not unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably,
or careleſly expos'd, its beauty which it borrows from none
but it ſelf, can never want hearty admirers.</p>

which thence takes its courſe; bordered with fruitful Plains and
Mountains. Hence we may imagine, a place ſo commodious, as
well for neceſſity as delight, hath drawn thither Inhabitants at the
ſame time the Countrey began to be cultivated. But Cities and
Perſons have the ſame fate: The more any Family is anciently
Noble, the more difficult a matter it is to produce its Titles. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
is as a dark Night, whoſe obſcurity cannot be diſſipated, and
in which a man can do nothing but ſearch about to no purpoſe.
How many Fables do we find mixt with the Original of <hi>Troy, Rome</hi>

what can be expected from mean ones, whoſe miſhap having been to
have no Author to be the Guardian or Depoſitary of their Hiſtory,
they have therefore lain in obſcurity. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> is the firſt who
mentions <hi>Geneva,</hi> yet there is no doubt, but it was then a City un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Government, and a place of ſtrength, which kept one of the
paſſages out of <hi>Gaule</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany:</hi> For it was undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Intereſt of the <hi>Allobroges,</hi> or Inhabitants of <hi>Gallia Tranſalpina,</hi>
being neighbours to the <hi>Helvetians</hi> and <hi>Latobriges,</hi> a people of
<hi>Gallia Belgica,</hi> who held <hi>Switzerland</hi> and the Country of <hi>Vaud</hi> at that
time, to have a Fort, which ſhould ſhelter them from the Incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

                  <note place="margin">Antiquity of <hi>Geneva.</hi>

of the <hi>Alps</hi> and low Countrey betwixt <hi>Rhoſne</hi> and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
They were a valiant people, and had gained great reputation
by their courage; neither were they inferiour to the reſt of the
<hi>Gaules</hi> in Riches. <hi>Stephen de Byzance</hi> and <hi>Livy,</hi> who cannot be
ſuſpected of flattery, give them theſe <hi>Elogies. Geneva</hi> then was
a great while before <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s time: And as well his ſilence, as other
Authors, inclines us to believe, that its Original was unknown.
All that the Moderns have aſſerted concerning this matter, is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on an uncertain Author, and on a Chronological Manuſcript of
the Countrey of <hi>Vaud,</hi> being about four hundred years ſince it was
written, as we may judge by the time which endeth the Hiſtory.
The Author of the <hi>Genevoiſe Citizen</hi> relates, that it was kept in his
time in the Caſtle of <hi>Chillon</hi> on the Lake; and there is now one
there to be ſeen, which perhaps is the ſame with that in the City of
<hi>Orbe</hi> in the Countrey of <hi>Vaud.</hi> The little Book Printed at <hi>Lyons</hi> in
1614. Entituled <hi>A Chronology of the Countrey of Vaud,</hi> is an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome

                  <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> of the Hiſtory of <hi>Geneva</hi> have taken out ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars

               <p>Although to ſpeak ingenuouſly, this Chronicle appears to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but a ſlight exerciſe of ſome half-witted Scribler of former
times, and therefore deſerves not much to be credited: howſoever,
I ſhall here offer what he aſſerts concerning the Foundation of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> leaving the Reader to his own liberty to judge and believe if

here then what he ſaith.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the year of the Worlds Creation 2729. and 1073. years after
the Flood, the great <hi>Hercules</hi> coming into <hi>Spain</hi> to go over into
<hi>Italy,</hi> he paſs'd near the Lake which hath been ſince call'd <hi>Leman,</hi>
where ſeeing ſo fine a Countrey inhabited, he left there one part of
his Army which was ſick, under the Command of <hi>Arpentinus.</hi> This
Captain liking the Countrey, built on the ſide of the Lake, a City
which he call'd <hi>Arpentras</hi> or <hi>Arpentrine,</hi> which was ſeated higher
than where lyes now <hi>Lauſanne</hi> (and in effect there yet may be
ſeen ſome marks of a City) this was founded in the year of the
Worlds Creation 2730. and fifty three years before the deſtruction
of <hi>Troy.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Arpentinus</hi> was ſucceeded by his Son <hi>Rigo:</hi> after the deſtruction
of <hi>Troy,</hi> when <hi>Francus, Aeneas, Antenor,</hi> with many more, came
to inhabit other Countreys; about which time <hi>Lemannus Paris</hi>'s
Son arriv'd in thoſe parts with his <hi>Trojans,</hi> driving out <hi>Rigo</hi> from
<hi>Arpentras;</hi> and being in full poſſeſſion, call'd the Lake after his
own Name, <hi>Leman.</hi> This <hi>Lemannus</hi> having reign'd a conſiderable
time, was at length drove out from <hi>Arpentras</hi> by his own Subjects
who rebelled againſt him, and killed one of his Sons: whereupon
he in revenge, having taken again the City, demoliſh'd it; and
ſeeking a new place whereon to build another, he came to the end
of the Lake, whence iſſues forth the <hi>Rhoſne;</hi> and finding a little
Hill of <hi>(Genevriers,</hi> or) Shrubs, he layes there the foundations of
a City, which he call'd for this reaſon, <hi>Genevra</hi> or <hi>Genebra.</hi> This
was in the year of the Worlds Creation 2833. and fifty years after
the deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> and three hundred ſeventy nine years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Building of <hi>Rome,</hi> and eleven hundred and thirty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Birth of our Saviour. After <hi>Lemannus</hi> (who dyed
whilſt they were building <hi>Geneva)</hi> his Son <hi>Eructonius</hi> reigned
eight and twenty years, leaving three Sons who divided the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
betwixt them, <hi>viz. Sequanus, Allobrox</hi> and <hi>Helvetius.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This Chronicle likewiſe makes mention of ſeveral other Kings of
theſe Countreys, as <hi>Milius, Ergogus, Tigurus, Epantalus, Aviticus,
Carphas</hi> and his three Sons <hi>Conodus, Gavotus</hi> and <hi>Equeſter, Caturigus,
Flenans, Arulus, Centronius, Benevits, Algurus Ciricus</hi> and <hi>Oblius,</hi> who
built a Fortreſs at <hi>Geneva</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Rhoſne.</hi> Theſe names rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
offer themſelves for the finding out the Founders of Cities,
and the Etymology of the names of Provinces: which gives us
plainly to underſtand, that this is a Hiſtory deviſed at pleaſure, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there are many of theſe <hi>Latin</hi> words, although that Tongue was
not known till ſome Ages after. <hi>Sequanus</hi> (ſayes the Chronicle)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50836:6"/>
gave his name to the County of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> from whence the people
were call'd <hi>Sequaeni: Allobrox</hi> gave his name to the Countrey of the
<hi>Allobroges; Equeſter</hi> to the Country of <hi>Vaud,</hi> where was <hi>Colonia
Equeſtris; Ergogus</hi> to that of <hi>Ergau; Helvetius</hi> to that of <hi>Helvetia;
Aventica, Helvetius</hi> his Concubine, to <hi>Avanche; Centronius,</hi> to the
<hi>Centrons,</hi> who are them of <hi>Tarantoiſe; Arulus,</hi> to <hi>Arles; Gavotus,</hi>
to <hi>Gavots; Benevits,</hi> to the City of the ſame name; and in ſhort,

               </p>
               <p>Now that which I find the worſt contriv'd in all this account,<note place="margin">Derivation of the word <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva.</hi>
                  </note>
is the Etymology of the word <hi>Geneva,</hi> which it derives from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>névres,</hi>
(or Jumper Shrubs) with which this little Hill on which
the City was built was over-ſpread; as if the <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>French</hi>
Tongue were ſpoken four Ages before <hi>Rome</hi> was built; for the
word <hi>Genévre</hi> comes from the <hi>Latin Juniperus:</hi> So it is alſo with
the word <hi>Equeſtris,</hi> which was never heard of in the Countrey of
<hi>Vaud</hi> till <hi>Caeſur</hi>'s time, as we ſhall have occaſion to mention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Not that this great Antiquity of eight and twenty Ages need be
ſuſpected, ſeeing there are Cities, as that of <hi>Athens,</hi> ancienter by five
hundred years: But we are never obliged to believe without proof;
neither do we find <hi>Homer</hi> to mention <hi>Lemannus Paris</hi> his Son, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it may well be expected, he ſhould ſay ſomething of him,
to inform us of the poſterity of that Heroe in his Poem. 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a very idle humour of ſome people, who would needs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the World, their Anceſtors were ſprung from the Aſhes of
<hi>Troy,</hi> and were no leſs than Founders of Cities; as if <hi>Troy</hi> had been
ſufficient to people all the World, after it ſelf had been ruin'd.</p>
               <p>Be it how it will concerning theſe eleven Ages before the coming
of our Saviour, we read of no conſiderable matters or Warlike feats
performed by the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> during that time, but what we have
from this Chronicle: They laid waſte the City of <hi>Benevits,</hi> which
ſtood diſtant from that place where now ſtandeth <hi>Nyons,</hi> becauſe it
would Lord it over the neighbouring Countreys, and exact Tribute.
It addeth, that this <hi>Oblius</hi> dyed without Children, and left all theſe
Countreys to the diſpoſal of their own people, who by this means
became free and under no Monarchy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> had the advantage of the <hi>Lake</hi> and the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> formidable to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </note>
which ſerv'd them inſtead of Ditches, and the <hi>Alps</hi> which ſheltered
them as Ramparts. They ſeparated them eſpecially from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
whoſe neighbourhood was chiefly to be feared, and againſt
whom they have ſignalized their Valour with the reſt of the <hi>Allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogeſes,</hi>
who extended their Borders as far as <hi>Iſere.</hi> The Air of
the Mountains which they breathed, and the ignorance of carnal
delights, which renders us ſoft and effeminate, made them Warlike
and Dreadful to their Neighbours. The <hi>Romans</hi> have tryed them
ſufficiently in their Wars againſt them. The firſt proof which they
gave of their Courage, was under the Conſul <hi>Marcus Fulvius,</hi> in the
year ſix hundred twenty eight from the Building of <hi>Rome,</hi> and one
hundred twenty five years before the Birth of our Saviour.<note place="margin">125. years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Birth of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</note> The
<hi>Auvergnats</hi> and them of <hi>Roüergue</hi> were joyned with the <hi>Allobroges.</hi>
The <hi>Romans</hi> bragg'd they had defeated them, though 'tis certain
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50836:7"/>
the Conſul obtain'd not the Triumph; which is a ſufficient proof,
that the loſs on the <hi>Gaules</hi> ſide was not great; and in effect the
War broke out again three years after, and the <hi>Allobroges</hi> raiſed
greater Forces.<note place="margin">122. years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</note> They fought the <hi>Romans</hi> near <hi>Orange,</hi> not far from
the place where the <hi>Sorgue</hi> diſchargeth it ſelf into the <hi>Rhoſne:</hi> the
<hi>Romans</hi> got the Victory by a Stratagem, after they had for a long
time vigorouſly diſputed it. They had brought with them Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
which they had cauſed to march againſt the <hi>Allobroges,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
the <hi>Gaules,</hi> having never ſeen them, would be affrighted, as
it indeed fell out; their Horſes being ſtartled, ſet a running, after the
ſame manner as it had happened heretofore to the <hi>Romans</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
when <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who firſt brought them into <hi>Italy,</hi> fought
againſt them ſo bloody a Battel, in which they were overthrown:
the <hi>Gaules</hi> loſt in this Conflict twenty thouſand men, and <hi>Bituitus</hi>
King of <hi>Auvergne</hi> one of their chiefeſt Captains was taken Priſoner,
and led away in Triumph by the Conſul <hi>Domitius Ahenobarbus,</hi> to
whom the care of this War was committed. Notwithſtanding this
overthrow, the <hi>Allobroges</hi> who had been overcome rather by their
Enemies Craft,<note place="margin">Paul. Oroſe.</note> than through their own want of Courage, took
again the Field the year following with their Confederates, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
as far as <hi>Iſere,</hi> offering the <hi>Romans</hi> Battel. The Conſul <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius
Maximus</hi> who was General, loſt his Quartan Ague in the heat of
the fight, and accompanied with his uſual good fortune, obtain'd a
ſignal Victory. Twenty ſix thouſand <hi>Gaules</hi> were cut in pieces,
and the Conſul obtain'd the glorious Title of <hi>Allobrogick,</hi> and the
great Triumph at his return to <hi>Rome.</hi> There might have been
ſeen not many years ſince in the Village of <hi>Verſoy,</hi> about a League
diſtant from <hi>Geneva,</hi> an old Marble Stone, on which was engraven
the Elogy of the Conqueror of the <hi>Allobroges.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Caeſar</hi> hath obſerv'd in the Conference which he had with <hi>Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſte,</hi>
that after this Victory, the <hi>Romans</hi> generouſly forgave the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergnats</hi>
and them of <hi>Rouergue,</hi> not exacting of them any Tribute,
nor ſo much as reducing them into a Province. From whence, 'tis
likely, that the <hi>Allobroges,</hi> who were their Allies in this War,
were no worſe us'd: and that the <hi>Romans</hi> conſidering them rather
as Friends than <hi>Vaſſals,</hi> did let them live after their own manner,
and protected them againſt the inſultings of their neighbours.</p>

               <p>There are yet ſome Remains of this great Prince (who by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
made himſelf abſolute Lord of the <hi>Roman</hi> Republick) in the
Names of divers of the Families of the <hi>Julius's</hi> at <hi>Geneva,</hi> which
may be ſeen there in ſeveral ancient Inſcriptions. There are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
one <hi>Cajus Julius Caeſar Longinus</hi> a Free-man of this Emperour,
and <hi>Quintus Julius Sergius, Julius Macrinus,</hi> and <hi>Julius Brocchus</hi> an

Julia Vera,</hi> and <hi>Titus Julius Valerianus,</hi> Overſeer of the Publick
Buildings. Although perhaps not one of theſe were nearly related
to him; yet this ſhews at leaſt, that he had brought many <hi>Romans</hi>
with him thither, eſpecially them of his own Family, of which he
himſelf was at that time the greateſt.</p>
               <p>We muſt not here omit one Hiſtorical paſſage, of which ancient
Authors have taken no notice; which is, that after the overthrow
of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and ſpoil of the whole Countrey of <hi>Vaud,</hi> which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50836:8"/>
was then comprehended under the name of <hi>Pagus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbigenus,</hi> to
whom the City of <hi>Orbe</hi> gave that name: theſe parts were extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
depopulated;<note place="margin">A <hi>Roman</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony ſent to <hi>Geneva.</hi>

the <hi>Colony</hi> or <hi>Commonalty</hi> of the <hi>Equeſtres,</hi> as we find it in
the four ancient Inſcriptions which are at <hi>Geneva;</hi> and in a fifth
<hi>Julia Equeſtris;</hi> which is an evident proof, that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> had
founded it.<note place="margin">Deſeruere cavo tentoria fixa Lemanno.</note> For when the Civil War broke out between him and

                  <hi>Geneva</hi> kept firm thenceforward to the Emperours who ſucceeded
<hi>Julius Caeſar;</hi> and the Stones which are yet to be ſeen there engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in honour of ſeveral Emperours, witneſs as much. Some there
are which are dedicated to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> others to <hi>Trajan, Antoninus,
Marc. Aurelius</hi> and <hi>Trebonian,</hi> which we ſhall recite at the end of
this Hiſtory. There is alſo mention of ſeveral <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrates
who adminiſtred Juſtice after the ſame manner as in other <hi>Colonies.</hi>
There were likewiſe <hi>Sextumviri,</hi> who were ſix men eſtabliſhed
ſince <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s Reign; alſo <hi>Duumviri</hi> to determine Caſes of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Surveyors of Publick Buildings; Prelats and Pagan Prieſts,
and every thing elſe which the Religion and Cuſtom of the <hi>Romans</hi>
were wont to bring into conquered Contreys. There were alſo to be
ſeen on theſe ancient Marble Stones ſeveral kind of Vows engraven
to <hi>Jupiter, Mars</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> whom they worſhipped before the
coming of the <hi>Romans,</hi> after the manner of the other <hi>Gaules,</hi> under
the name of <hi>Tamaris, Theautate</hi> and <hi>Belenus.</hi> The little Rock in
the Lake ſerved inſtead of an Altar, which was dedicated to <hi>Neptune</hi>
God of the Watry Element: And 'tis from his name, that the Rock
called <hi>Neiton</hi> hath been deriv'd. There's to be ſeen on the biggeſt
(for there are two near one another) a hollow place which hath
been cut to kindle therein the fire for Sacrifices; and 'tis not long ſince
ſome Fiſher-men found at the foot of it two ſmall Hatchets and
a Braſs Knife, which is the ſame which they call'd then <hi>Securis</hi> and
<hi>Seceſpita,</hi> to cut the throats of thoſe Beaſts they ſacrificed.</p>
               <p>To finiſh what may be ſaid of <hi>Geneva</hi> in the time of Heatheniſm,
'tis certain that in <hi>Marc.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Geneva</hi> burnt in <hi>Marc. Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> his time.</note> 
                  <hi>Aurelius</hi>'s Reign the City was wholly
burnt, he having taken upon him the care to have it built anew.
Others ſay, this was done under <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> who likewiſe was
called <hi>Marc. Aurelius.</hi> There are ſome, who attribute its rebuilding
to <hi>Aurelian:</hi> Neither is it to be doubted, but that nearneſs of
Names hath occaſioned this confuſion in Hiſtory. There's yet to
be ſeen at <hi>Geneva</hi> an Inſcription of <hi>Marc. Aurelius,</hi> which gives ſome
credit to our firſt conjecture; for <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> reigned ſo little
a while, and behaved himſelf ſo unworthily and cruelly, that this
alone is ſufficient to carry us off from believing he had the leaſt
thought to become Benefactor to a City, for which he had not any
kindneſs.</p>

                  </note> and before the coming
of our Saviour, and in the following Ages, was as we ſhall deſcribe
it: Its Walls reach'd no higher than the height of the little Hill on
which S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s and other Streets are built: they were triangular,
after the ſame manner as the City. The Gate of the Caſtle above
the <hi>Borough de Four,</hi> which was one of the Gates of the City, made
one point of this Triangle. The ſecond Corner was where hath
ſince been built the Biſhop's Palace: and the third was on the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of the City, near the Buildings which were called hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Boyaus Tower.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Turris Botuli.</note> So that the circuit of the Walls, was from the
Gates of the Caſtle, and reach'd behind S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, very
near the foundations; and ſo went thorough <hi>Perron</hi>'s Street, where
'tis likely there was a Gate to come down to the Lake; from thence
it reach'd the length of the <hi>Channon</hi>'s Gardens, where there ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
ſome marks in the ruines: and going through the <hi>Peliſſerie,</hi>
they extend to that place which they call the City corner; where
may yet be ſeen the ruines of a Gate: from whence it appears, that
the Wall was as high as that Hill which reach'd to the Caſtle Gate,
and was of the ſame height with thoſe Houſes at this day to be ſeen
where the large Palace ſtood: And in effect the ancient Buildings in
that part of the City, have Walls in thickneſs equal to moſt Cities.
There might likewiſe probably be a Gate on the Walk leading to
the large Palace. The Caſtle Gate was ſo call'd, becauſe through it
was the ready way to the Caſtle of <hi>Gaillard,</hi> the uſual Dwelling-houſe
of the Earls of <hi>Geneva.</hi> The Borough of <hi>Four</hi> in ancient
times was only the Suburbs; which in the Language of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
were call'd <hi>Borg de Feur,</hi> which is to ſay, an Outward Borough:
from whence hath remain'd to it the Name of <hi>Bourg de Four.</hi> The
low Streets which are now call'd <hi>Les Rivieres,</hi> becauſe they were
near the Bank of the Lake, and the adjacent parts of S. <hi>Magdalene,</hi>
and the loweſt places of the City, were not then, as now, in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50836:9"/>
Heart of the Town; and the Buildings afterwards raiſed, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
heretofore accounted but as <hi>Suburbs.</hi> Since that time, the
City hath enlarged it ſelf; and there is ſtill to be ſeen near <hi>Longemale</hi>
a great Arch, called the Ivory Arch; not that the Gate was Ivory,
as ſome have imagined; but becauſe it was the Gate which led to
<hi>Yvoire,</hi> which is a Borough three Leagues diſtant from <hi>Geneva</hi>
on the Lakes Bank on the ſide of <hi>Chablais.</hi> The <hi>Suburb</hi> of S. <hi>Victor,</hi>

deſirous of their Converſion, ſent thither
firſt <hi>Nazarius</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Diſciple, who converted amongſt others,
a young man a <hi>Genevois</hi> named <hi>Celſus;</hi> who was baptized and ſealed
with his Blood the teſtimony of the Goſpel, having ſuffered Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom
a while after together with <hi>Nazarius.</hi> 'Tis thought they
were buried in S. <hi>Gervais;</hi> for which reaſon the next Street joyning
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50836:10"/>
to the Church hath taken its name, from their bodies being interred
there. The Manuſcripts, and after them the Author called the <hi>Citizen</hi>
do add, That the Chriſtian Faith newly planted, was watered by the
induſtry of <hi>Paracodus,</hi> or <hi>Paradocus,</hi> one of our Saviours Seventy
Diſciples, who came over into <hi>Gaule</hi> with <hi>Denis</hi> the <hi>Areopgite;</hi>
that having together founded the Church of <hi>Geneva, Denis</hi> went to
<hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Paradocus</hi> tarried at <hi>Geneva.</hi> This is the tradition of
former Ages, in which there appears nothing of ſolidity. Theſe
Chronologiſts ſeem plainly to have taken this Story of <hi>Nazarius</hi> and
<hi>Celſus</hi> out of the Golden Legend, which relates theſe two Saints
came to a City of the <hi>Gaules</hi> called <hi>Gemellus,</hi> and were there Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred
and Buried at <hi>Milan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot well underſtand how they ſhould take <hi>Gemellus</hi> for <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva:</hi>
this is certain, that S. <hi>Nazare</hi> hath been heretofore the Patron
of the City of <hi>Autun,</hi> where there is yet a Church which is dedicated
to him and S. <hi>Celſe;</hi> it is called by the name of S. <hi>Nazaire.</hi> There
was to be ſeen an ancient Coin which confirms it; ſeeing we read
on one ſide of it S. <hi>Nazarius,</hi> and on the other <hi>Hedua Civitas,</hi>
which is the City of <hi>Autun:</hi>

had cauſed them of <hi>Autun</hi> in time to receive S. <hi>Lazarus</hi> for their
Patron; whom they would make us believe, dyed in their City ſoon
after his arrival in <hi>Provence:</hi> all which hath no other foundation,
but an uncertain tradition.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Denis</hi> and <hi>Paracodus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">194. years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</note> obſerve what is ſaid of them;
in the year of our Redemption 194. according to <hi>Baronius, Victor</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> wrote to <hi>Didier</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Vienna</hi> touching the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration
of the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter:</hi> This <hi>Didier</hi> was ſucceeded by <hi>Denis,</hi>
who was followed by <hi>Paracodus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">198.</note> to whom <hi>Victor</hi> wrote to the ſame
effect. So that here is already a great miſtake, to believe that <hi>Denis</hi>
and <hi>Paracodus</hi> firſt planted the Chriſtian Faith at <hi>Geneva:</hi> for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they were both Biſhops of <hi>Vienna,</hi> then chief City of the <hi>Allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broges,</hi>
it is hence moſt likely, they ſent ſome to <hi>Geneva</hi> to preach
the Goſpel, it lying in their Circuit: But that which gives greater
confirmation, is what hath been found written in an old Manuſcript
Parchment Bible in the Library at <hi>Geneva,</hi> viz. <hi>Genevenſis Eccleſia

                  <hi>Paracodus</hi> and <hi>Denis</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Vienna,</hi> who
have founded the Church at <hi>Geneva,</hi> were called the Apoſtles Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
becauſe they taught the ſame Doctrine. So that <hi>Paracodus</hi>
could not be one of the Seventy Diſciples, ſeeing he lived towards
the end of the ſecond Century. Likewiſe ſome would make him

by ſome paſſages out of <hi>Avitus</hi>'s Homilies, that it was he who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
that Church, there being there before a Temple dedicated
to <hi>Apollo:</hi> But the building was intermitted till the year 990 at which
time the Emperour <hi>Othon</hi> cauſed it to be continued, and <hi>Conradus</hi>
finiſhed it in the year 1024. But I doubt whether we ought to
credit thoſe Chronological Manuſcrips, which relate, that under the
Reign of <hi>Gontran,</hi> a certain City named <hi>Taurodinum,</hi> was overthrown
into the <hi>Rhoſne</hi> by an Earthquake; whoſe courſe being ſtopped,
there followed ſuch a great Inundation, that it ran over the Walls of
<hi>Geneva.</hi> But there is not ſo much as any ſingle Geographer who
mentions this City. Monſieur <hi>la Mothe le Vayer</hi> relates the matter
after a different manner, and more likely to be true. <hi>Marius,</hi> ſaith

               <p>This is the Epitome of the eleven firſt Ages ſince the coming of

You then, dear Brother, being animtated by theſe examples, gird up

appeared mighty zealous for the Rights of the Church; but in

It is well known, that the Church of</hi> Geneva <hi>is the only

himſelf when choſen, was ſworn to maintain the Priviledges

grant to the Duke of <hi>Zeringuen,</hi> nor to Biſhops, the Soveraignty
of an Imperial City as theirs was, without the ſuffrage of the
whole Empire: That even when the Biſhops were in moſt credit, it

the Biſhop was chief after the ſame manner as the Dukes of <hi>Venice</hi>

of the Biſhop, his <hi>Vidame</hi> (or Steward) the <hi>Syndicks</hi> and other
good Men of the City. The Biſhop was choſen by the Laity as well
as Clergy. His Chapter conſiſted of thirty two Chanons of S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
Church, the greateſt part of which were Civilians; he had
moreover for Aſſiſtants in Secular matters, four <hi>Syndicks,</hi> twenty
Counſellors at Law, and one Treaſurer, who were all choſen by
the people: To theſe twenty five were added thirty five more, to
adviſe with, upon any important occurrence; and from hence
they have riſen to the preſent number of two hundred, and
have at length extended to the ta king in one out of every chief Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
in the City. The Biſhop was obliged to confirm whatſoever
paſſed. They have farther affirmed, that the <hi>Syndicks</hi> had power to
coin Money, and the care and charge of the Town without the Biſhops
intermedling, the Juriſdiction and Impriſonment in the Night, and
Sovereign Judgment in matters of Life and Death, provided the
Priſoners were not Eccleſiaſticks. That in Caſes which called for
Mercy, the Biſhop had power of pardoning, but rather by his Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
and Eccleſiaſtical Authority than Secular; that in buſineſs of
great concernment he could do nothing without the people; that
the Commonalty and <hi>Syndicks</hi> ſhould make what Alliances they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,

Grant of the Vicaridge given to the Earl of <hi>Verd:</hi> neither had they

Earl of <hi>Verd,</hi> ſhould extend it ſelf to the Temporalties of the
Church, and particularly of <hi>Geneva:</hi> whereupon he iſſues out an
Order, like unto that made by <hi>Frederick:</hi> but he Earl of <hi>Verd</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
to obey it, he was ſuſpended by the Emperour, till he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his claim, after the ſame manner as it had heretofore happened
to Earl <hi>Amé,</hi> in the time of <hi>Nantelinus</hi> the Biſhop. This Emperor
made two Deeds of Revocation the firſt at <hi>Francfort</hi> on the 10. of <hi>Sept.</hi>
1366. and the other in the ſame City, on the fourth day of the
aforeſaid Month. In the firſt he annulls and makes void the Vicaridge
granted by error to the Earl <hi>Amé</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by conſent of the
Princes of the Empire, and reſtores them to their ancient Liberties.
The ſecond was in the nature of a Mandate to the Archbiſhops and
Officers of the Empire, to publiſh it in all parts, to the end the
ſaid Earl might not pretend ignorance. In the year following there
was a third Declaration made at <hi>Hertingfeld,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1367.</note> in which he expreſly
revokes the Vicaridge heretofore granted at the importunate ſuit
of his dear Couſin <hi>Amé</hi> Earl of <hi>Savoy,</hi> making for ever void all
Power, Juriſdiction and Right, which either he or his Succeſſors
might claim on <hi>Geneva</hi> or its Dependencies, qualifying the ſaid
City with the Title of <hi>Noble Member of the Empire.</hi> Finally, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Contumacy of the ſaid Earl, there was iſſued forth a fourth
Decree given at <hi>Prague</hi> the fifteenth of <hi>February,</hi> to ſtrengthen this
Revocation, under penalty of one thouſand Marks of Gold,
the one half forfeited to the Treaſury, and the other part to
others.</p>
               <p>Yet the Earl reſtored not what he poſſeſſed to the Church of
<hi>Geneva;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1371.</note> whereupon the Biſhop of <hi>Marcoſſay</hi> applys himſelf to Pope
<hi>Gregory</hi> the eleventh, whoſe Seat was then at <hi>Avignon,</hi> into whoſe
hands they both reſigned the difference, promiſing to ſtand to his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50836:18"/>
deciſion. The Pope enjoyned the Earl to relinquiſh whatſoever he
had belonging to the Church, and to deliver to the Biſhop the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Letters relating to the Vicaridge; continuing to him the right
the ſaid Earl had to the <hi>Vidomnat</hi> or Stewardſhip, and to the
Caſtle of the Iſle, which he did by an Act made at <hi>Thonon;</hi> reſtoring
to the Biſhop and Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> whatſoever he had taken from
them, promiſing inviolably to obſerve the ſaid agreement. This was
Publiſhed on <hi>All-Saints</hi> day, in S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church: ſo that <hi>William</hi>

any of the Country of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> for he mortally hated them, eſpecially
ſince this trick of his Mothers, for he imagined they were the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

to look for them, fearing to raiſe a tumult amongſt the people,
which occaſioned his return without doing any hurt. The Duke his
father enraged at this, deſired the people to aſſemble in the Church
where he was lodged; which they did, and he made his complaints:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50836:22"/>
but the <hi>Syndicks</hi> dared not to appear; the people excuſed themſelves,

remitted the Titles of the affairs of <hi>Geneva</hi> to the King, of which he

common Soldiers then thus mutinying had private Cabals, wherein
it was agreed to fetch their pay by main force. They therefore to

his name and during his life, by which means he ſecured himſelf from

and the whole State of <hi>Savoy</hi> at <hi>Chiſſy</hi>'s ſollicitation were about
taking the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi>'s part. The King liking this adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement,
recompences him with the Biſhoprick of <hi>Viviers. De Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mieres</hi>
not content with this, would carry it on further, and would
have <hi>Chiſſy</hi> ſeized and brought to the King, that he might be made to
diſcover all the Biſhops intrigues. He came then to <hi>Geneva</hi> with
three or four of his brethren, and ſtaid there about fifteen days, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
their journey was only to ſee their friends, and recreate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
awhile. In the mean time there came ſeveral into the City to
help his undertaking, and to lay hold on <hi>Chiſſy;</hi> they being adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
where he lay with the Biſhop, as <hi>Pommieres</hi> himſelf was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to do when he was in favour,<note place="margin">3. January.</note> they ventured to take him in
the very Biſhoprick.<note place="margin">1477.</note> For though the Biſhop had guards as is uſual
with great perſons, yet he minded not whether they kept ſtrict
watch, but permitted them to go about the Town at their pleaſure;
ſo that they ſerved only for ſhow. In the morning as ſoon as ever the
gates were opened, <hi>Pommieres</hi> and his company made a ſhift to get
entrance into the Chamber, where the Biſhop and <hi>Chiſſy</hi> lodged; the
latter of which they made riſe, and drew him out of the room in his
ſhirt into the ſtreet where their horſes were ready; they ſet him on
one, his hands being pinioned, and carried him thus out in his ſhirt
through the gate of <hi>Rive,</hi> the Biſhop not daring to utter a word; but
the youngeſt of <hi>Pommieres</hi> brothers was wholly taken up in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining

noiſe of this rape being ſpread over the Town, they were immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all up in arms; which the young <hi>Pommieres</hi> perceiving too late,
he ſets ſpurrs to his Horſe thinking to paſs through the gate of <hi>Rive,</hi> as
they did before him; but finding it ſhut, he turns his horſe think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to get through <hi>Corraterie,</hi> but it was too late, for they had began
already to faſten it; he endeavoured nevertheleſs to get out, but as
he was under the wicket, they let fall the Portcullices, which light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on his horſes crupper ſtruck him to the ground; ſo that he was
taken, and led to the Biſhop, who put him into the hands of <hi>Chiſſy</hi>'s

In the ſame year there was a great ſcarcity of proviſion, ſo that a

forgive, when there was occaſion, as he made it appear by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;

This Cardinal thinking it a hard matter to ſettle himſelf in this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick

               <p>The plague which continued at <hi>Geneva,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Famine in <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </note> was attended with a great
want of rain, which brought along with it a ſcarcity of proviſion;
which forced the Country people (who dared not before approach
the Town) to come into it, whether moved by devotion or urged
by want; for they came in proceſſion from all parts to our Lady of
<hi>Grace,</hi> to deſire of her Rain, but they could not obtain it; and the
ſcarcity continuing the next year following, a buſhel of Corn
which was worth before but two ſhillings, was now valued at a
Crown, the Crown going but for three ſhillings and two pence, ſo
that the poor Peaſants were forced to live on herbs and roots, which
ſometimes they had not patience to dreſs.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Le Mortel</hi> a famous Thief made himſelf much talked of in
thoſe times,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mortel</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Thief.</note> it was known by all what trade he followed, the people
about the Town ſecuring their goods in the City for fear of him;<note place="margin">1504.</note>
where likewiſe it was no ſooner night, but the Maſters called to their
men to keep faſt their doors for fear of <hi>Mortel,</hi> which afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a proverb; but all their care did not avail them, for he broke
in every where, eſpecially where they were moſt cautious of him;
he ſeemed to be not ſo much ſollicitous after the mony, as how he
ſhould do his work dexterouſly, for he took but ſmall ſumms only to
ſpend with his Comrades; whether he did his work by ſlight of
hand, or by charms it is uncertain, yet it is reported of him that he ſo
enchanted the people, that they loſt all ability of ſpeaking or reſiſting.
The firſt thing he did when he came in, was to take the Keys even
from under the Maſter of the houſes pillow although awake; he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Cup board, Sellar door, lighted a Candle, laid the Cloth, eat
and drank, no body hindring him. The next morning after this he
uſually went to the Tavern with his companions, the Vintners recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him gladly, for beſides his being a good Cuſtomer to them, he
never defrauded them of any thing; when he wanted mony, he
would bid his Hoſt to ſeek in the Corner of ſuch a Chamber, which
perhaps no body had entred a long time, where they were ſure to find
their due to a farthing.</p>
               <p>Every body wondered he was not puniſhed by the Magiſtrates: he
was indeed ſeveral times impriſoned; but the <hi>Syndicks</hi> dared not act
contrary to their Laws and Cuſtoms, which were to condemn no man
without his own Confeſſion; for when he ſuffered the Rack, he was
more firm and conſtant in denying the truth, than a Martyr could be
in confeſſing it; whether this came through want of the ſenſe of pain,
or that he was ſo ſtout as to deſpiſe it, ſo that he valued the Rack no
more than a fillip; for when he was ſtretched upon it, he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to have been exceedingly tortured, and would deſire them to
take him off, promiſing to confeſs the fact; but when he was queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50836:27"/>
about it he would anſwer, <hi>Well, what would you have me ſay?</hi>
repeating their words after them, and deſiring them to give him <hi>the
other ſtroak for the ſake of the Ladies.</hi> He died not ſuch a death as he
deſerved, though dreadful enough, for he was ſeized with the Plague
ſo vehemently as that it took away his ſpeech; his Mother who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
him in his ſickneſs fearing he ſhould eſcape it, and come one
day to be hanged, put him into a Coffin, and cauſed him to be buried
alive.</p>

<hi>Geneva,</hi> though he had often promiſed it, which put the City to a

               <p>Duke <hi>Charles</hi> being at difference with them of <hi>Valey,</hi> required help

               <p>In this year there was an inſurrection of the people againſt the
<hi>Vidame</hi> or Steward <hi>Aymé Conſilii;</hi> the occaſion of it was this, There
were two Priſons in <hi>Geneva,</hi> and to each of them a Jaylor; one was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the Clergy and was called the Biſhoprick, the other for Laymen
in the Iſle of <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> of which the <hi>Vidame</hi> was Governor having under
him a Jaylor; who having been excommunicated for a certain ſumm
of mony which he owed, and not obeying, the ſentence was aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the Creditor would conſtrain him by the Biſhops Authority;
the Biſhops Treaſurer went to the Iſle to take him, and carried him to
the Biſhoprick, giving him in Charge to the Jaylor of that Priſon;
the <hi>Vidame</hi> ſuppoſing the Biſhops Officers had not any ſuch power on
the Dukedom, demanded his Priſoner of the Biſhops Jaylor, which
he refuſed, excuſing himſelf in as much as he dared not do it without
his maſters conſent. The <hi>Vidame</hi> enraged at his denial, cauſed his
Sergeant to ſeize on him, and carry him to the Priſon of the Iſle,
which coming to the Treaſurers ear, he ran about the City crying
out like a mad man, <hi>help, help, Gentlemen, againſt the</hi> Vidame, <hi>who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſons

came from <hi>Chambery</hi> to <hi>Geneva</hi> with the Biſhop, deſiring to have theſe
mutinous perſons (as he called them) puniſhed; but the Biſhop ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made full inquiry into the buſineſs, found that the <hi>Vidame</hi> was
in the wrong; which he ſhewed the Duke, but he was not thereat
ſatisfied, for that which was reaſon to the Biſhop, was not the ſame
to the Duke. The former of theſe thought they which had laid hold
on the <hi>Vidame</hi> had reaſon to maintain his Authority, as being their
Prince: and the Duke on the other ſide believed they had proceeded
contrary to equity, foraſmuch as he eſteemed himſelf Prince of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
he would therefore have the Biſhop put to death the Authors of
this Sedition, whom he thought were thoſe who had obtained the
freedom of <hi>Fribourg,</hi> for he would not do it by his own Authority,
leſt he ſhould provoke this Canton; and the Biſhop not conſenting,
he was ſo enraged againſt him, as to tell him he had made him Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
but he would deprive him of that dignity, and make him the
pooreſt Prieſt in his Dioceſs; but the Biſhop dying at <hi>Moirane,</hi> ſome

                  <hi>Geneva</hi> much lamented his loſs, having been ever a maintainer of the
Priviledges both of Church and State. The Pope and Duke having
heard of the Biſhops deceaſe, were both concerned in the choice of a
Succeſſor.</p>
               <p>The Pope would diſpoſe of it as he had done heretofore, but the
Clergy and Laity of <hi>Geneva,</hi> would not loſe their right in this affair;
whereupon they betake themſelves to their Arms, and ſhut the City
Gates, aſſembling in S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church to chuſe their Biſhop; they
could not pitch upon a fitter perſon that <hi>Amé</hi> of <hi>Gingins</hi> Abbot of

conſiderations. He was a Chanon, and of a noble and ancient fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and moreover allied and beloved by the Confederates, who held
at that time a good correſpondency with Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond; he
was alſo very zealous for the Liberties and Priviledges of both
Church and State, and of a very comely perſonage, whoſe onely fault
was, that he was too great a lover of the female Sex. The Chapter
then having choſen him by the peoples conſent, diſpatched a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the Confederate Cantons, deſiring their commendatory Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

The Duke ſeeing this young man as he grew in years, to become
neither amiable in body nor mind, only gave him ſome lean Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which he held till <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Serſſel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Geneva</hi> died; upon

               <p>The Biſhop likewiſe diſguiſing his deſigns, anſwered them with a

Preſident of <hi>Dijon,</hi> and the moſt Chriſtian Kings Embaſſador to

if they ſhould let him eſcape, of the reſentment of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
Cantons. The Council knew not what to reſolve touching
this matter, foreſeeing that if they ſhould detain the Ambaſſador, they
ſhould incur the Kings diſpleaſure; and if they ſhould let him go
free, they would diſoblige the <hi>Switzers;</hi> ſo that not knowing what
courſe to take,<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador confined.</note> it was adviſed to have recourſe to the Biſhop upon
this affair; but he being abſent, it was concluded he ſhould have
guards ſet over him in the name of the City, Biſhop, and <hi>Vidame;</hi>
and for greater ſecurity he ſhould be lodged in the Biſhoprick, that
the City gates ſhould be kept ſhut, and a ſufficient guard ſet to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
violence either from one ſide or other, and in ſhort that a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
ſhould be ſent to the Biſhop to know his pleaſure; but before they
could receive his anſwer, Deputies ariſe at <hi>Geneva</hi> from <hi>Bern</hi> and
<hi>Fribourg;</hi> requiring that the Preſident ſhould be delivered to them.
On the other hand the King of <hi>France,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Angouleſme,</hi> and the
Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> writ to the City to releaſe him; in this ſtrait the Biſhop
was ſent to, who ordered this anſwer to be given the Deputies, that the
Biſhop being a Churchman, he could not ſurrender the Preſident, for
ſhould he be put to death, he ſhould be guilty of an irregularity, and
degraded from his Epiſcopal dignity, and the City deprived of its
Paſtour; and if the <hi>Syndicks</hi> ſhould do it in their own names, it would
prejudice their Liberties and Priviledges, which made them Judges
in Criminal cauſes without appeal to any perſon; and that in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Confederate Cantons requeſt, they would acknowledge them
their ſuperiours, by which means they would be eſteemed betrayers
of the peoples Liberty, adding withall they would do the King
wrong, who perhaps might one day give them cauſe to repent it;
ſo that the Confederates Deputies ſhould be deſired to forbear their
requeſt. That yet if they could convict the Preſident of that which
they accuſed him, they ſhould ſoon have juſtice done them, rather
out of reſpect to the divine Law than any other conſideration. Which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50836:29"/>
anſwer was delivered them by the <hi>Syndick Levrier,</hi> but the Deputies
replied, that the buſineſs was a matter of that nature as could not be
ended by ordinary courſe of Law, inſtantly urging them again to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the Preſident into their hands, which if they would not, their
Superiors ſhould highly reſent it. To which it was anſwered, that
they for their parts would not deliver him to them, but if they would
take him, they would not reſiſt them. They were contented with this
ſhift, and went to the Biſhoprick to take him by force, they carried
him bound hand and foot to <hi>Fribourg,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Berne,</hi>
where he underwent the Rack, and afterwards was releaſed upon
an agreement.</p>

the intention of the Teſtator was to have them employed in
the ſervice of God and his Church, for an amends of the evil he had
done, having made them with the Churches Treaſure; but the <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicks</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1515.</note> which he granted

the Prelate had not power to renounce his Temporal Juriſdiction,
neither could the Pope confirm ſuch a renunciation, unleſs the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

               <p>The Duke remaining in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Geneva</hi> in
his Abby of <hi>Pignerol</hi> which fell to him by the deceaſe of <hi>Bonnivard,</hi>
he abode there with ſmall attendance, taking mony from all hands to
pay the Pope and Duke the firſt-fruits of his benefice, and the charge
he had been at in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> at his Election; a certain perſon
beſeeching him one day to be favourable to a friend of his Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to pay a Fine; he anſwered that he could not remit it, for as for
his part he had nothing but a Croſiers Staff and a Mitre, the Duke
of <hi>Savoy</hi> having the Biſhoprick and Abby: and in effect the Duke had
appointed one to receive the Revenue of the Abby, allowing him
only enough to maintain him; he would have done the ſame with
the Biſhoprick, had not the Biſhop hindered him by returning to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi>
where he was no ſooner arrived, but he quarrelled with
a certain perſon named <hi>Paſquet,</hi> who was accuſed of Uſury; but
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50836:30"/>
this was contrary to the Laws of <hi>Geneva,</hi> which forbad Citizens
ſhould be brought in trouble for this reaſon; There was great forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
upon this point between the Biſhop and Citizens, who could
not obtain the Priſoners deliverance. His relations found out an
expedient, which was, that having married his Daughter to a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen

Superiors, and managed ſo well his Father-in-laws cauſe, that he was

accuſation, being eſteemed a very honeſt Man; the <hi>Syndicks</hi> and
Counſel deſired that the Informations ſhould be put into their hands
to proceed thereupon, as Judges in criminal Caſes; on the other ſide
the Biſhop and <hi>Vidame</hi> would have it brought under their cogniſance,
and fearing a ſedition, they would have conveyed him privately
out of the Town, that they might deal with him as they thought
fit. But <hi>Vandel</hi> had four Sons, one of which named <hi>Thomas,</hi> Curate
of S. <hi>Morges,</hi> knew how to uſe a Sword, as well as a Prayer-book.
<hi>Robert</hi> was of his Fathers calling, who with the other two having
notice of the deſign, reſolved to reſcue their Father; but they loſt
their aim by miſtaking the time, but the next morning they failed
not to diſcover to the people what was become of him; the people
enraged at this action, ſet upon the Biſhops Penſioners, telling them,
<hi>they loved their Mony better than the Cities Liberties.</hi> The Council be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Aſſembled, the people made their Complaints to them, that the
Priviledges of the City were violated, and that the Biſhops Penſions
occaſioned it; the Penſioners informed of the buſineſs, preſented
themſelves, bringing with them the Letters of their penſion, which
they tore before the Council, proteſting they were not ſo much the
Biſhops ſervants,<note place="margin">Popular tumults.</note> as to forget their Obligations to the City, deſiring
nothing more than to manifeſt their zeal for the publick intereſt, for
which they were willing to ſacrifice both their lives and fortunes. The
people flocked from all parts, <hi>John Bernard</hi> ran to the Steeple to
Ring the great Bell, and Convocate the general Council, which was
then of as dangerous conſequence as to fire the Beacon in the Valley,
which was a ſignal of ſome great emotion; <hi>Bernard</hi> finding the Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
door ſhut would have broke it open, had not he been withheld by
much entreaty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Syndicks</hi> went to the Biſhop, beſeeching him not to anger the
people, whoſe rage was ever to be feared; but to preſerve their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
according to the Oath taken at his entrance, delivering to
them his Priſoner. The Biſhop being alarmed at theſe Tumults,
would not be obſtinate but releaſed <hi>Vandel,</hi> and deſiſted from proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
him. He bore notwithſtanding a deadly hatred againſt <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
in his mind for his forwardneſs, and not daring to meddle with
him in <hi>Geneva,</hi> he watcht him one day when he was gone out of the
City upon ſome occaſion; where ſome perſons planted by him for
that purpoſe ſeiſed on him, and led him away bound to <hi>Juſſy</hi> where he
determined to puniſh him; yet he releaſed him at the requeſt of the
Earl of <hi>Genevois,</hi> and ſome Ladies, the Earl being then in the City, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
making him to ask him forgiveneſs.</p>

The Biſhop and his Steward could not inrich themſelves in <hi>Geneva,</hi>
ſeeing the City had ſo little kindneſs for them; but their Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſet them on the poor Prieſts of the Dioceſs, which rendred this
Prelate extream odious; his perſon could not be acceptable to them,
and his mind was as ill ſhaped as his body, ſo that he became the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

Chantre and Chanon of <hi>Geneva,</hi> incompany likewiſe of the Abbot of

days,</hi> as is commonly ſaid of all Popes, meaning he was taken with
an incurable diſtemper, to wit the <hi>French Pox,</hi> and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
he could not live long; which words were taken notice of
by two ſpyes who made report of them to the Biſhop, interpreting
them, as if he had a deſign to take away his life, which he either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
or pretended he did, that he might make this ſerviceable to
his purpoſe, which was to bring the City into ſubjection.</p>
               <p>He diſſembled his reſentment the beſt he could in expectation of
a fit opportunity, which at length thus offers it ſelf after the Duke
had been a while at <hi>Lyons,</hi> to viſit the Queen his Neece; he ſent to
the Biſhop to come to him, which he did, commanding his Caterer
to provide Fiſh-pyes to eat as they travelled; the Caterer to ſave
charges had bought ſtale fiſh, one of which pyes being brought to the
Table, the Biſhop either not having a ſtomack, or diſliking the fiſh,
would eat none of it; it therefore fell to the ſervants ſhare, who eat
it up every bit; now there was not one who had eaten of it, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
died or fell dangerous ill. The Biſhop glad of this occaſion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſorry for his ſervants loſs, cauſed his <hi>Vidame</hi> to draw up an
accuſation privately againſt <hi>Pecolat,</hi> who was not a man of that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to throw water on this fire; yet they proceeded no farther in it,
being hindred by more urgent affairs which the Duke had then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Mountains.</p>
               <p>This Prince willing to try the <hi>Syndicks</hi> affections towards him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
them to ſend him three pieces of the Cannon left by <hi>Bonnivard;</hi>
which being refuſed him, he thereupon conceived a deadly hatred
againſt the City, which was fomented by one of his Courtiers called
<hi>Claudius</hi> of <hi>Seyſſel,</hi> who had been Profeſſor of the Civil Law at <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>
and ſince Maſter of the Requeſts under the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Lewis</hi> the
twelfth, afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and laſtly Archbiſhop of
<hi>Turin.</hi> He Counſelled the Duke not to ſuffer two Biſhopricks in the
heart of his Countries, to wit, <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Lauſane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The City was frequently diſturbed by diſagreements among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
There was no ſmall ſtrife once amongſt them upon a very ſilly
occaſion, about a Mules skin. The Biſhop had an Officer called <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius
Groſſi,</hi> who was at variance with a young man of the City, who
was related to his wife,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Groſſi</hi>'s Mule hamſtringed.</note> named <hi>Andrew Malvenda,</hi> his father came of
a Noble Family at <hi>Valence</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> This young man aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
having one day hamſtringed <hi>Groſſi</hi> his Mule in the Stable, ſpread
a report, it was the Children of the houſes Maſter who had done it;
and not content with this, he gets ten or twelve young men of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50836:31"/>
Town, of which <hi>Berthelier</hi> was one, and took along with them a
fool called little <hi>John,</hi> with whom they walked about the City all
night, making him bawl out at every turning, <hi>O yes, if any perſon wants
a skin of the groſſeſt beaſt in all the Town, they may be furniſhed at a very
reaſonable rate,</hi> alluding to the name of <hi>Groſſi;</hi> whereat he makes his
complaint to the <hi>Vidame</hi> and Epiſcopal Council, telling them that
they were not content in putting this trick upon him who was in
Office, but they muſt needs expoſe it in raillery throughout the
Town. The Council ordered the <hi>Vidame</hi> to ſearch into the matter,
which having done, he found <hi>Berthelier</hi> whom he mortally hated to
be one of the Crew; he would have apprehended them, but fearing
they would be too ſtrong for him, he requires the Syndicks and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to aſſiſt him, which they did, but the young men hearing of it hid
themſelves. They were publickly ſummoned to appear in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of the Iſle, on forfeiture of a hundred Florins a piece, which
turned to their advantage; for it being contrary to the cuſtom of the
City to lay any greater Fine than a Crown, unleſs in caſe of Felony
or ſuch like; they complained by their Attorny, that they obſerved
not the Statutes in their particular, this not being a Orime: their
complaint was brought before the Epiſcopal Council, where it was
declared they might defend themſelves being at liberty, <hi>pede non li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gato:</hi>
they came forth therefore from the places where they had hid
themſelves, and came and followed their ſuit; in the mean time the
Duke and Biſhop being informed of the matter, came to <hi>Geneva</hi>
with the Archbiſhop of <hi>Turin,</hi> who adviſed them not to be too haſty
in taking vengeance; that this was not ſufficient to make the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
conſent to the taking away their Temporalities, but this might
ſerve to continue the diſunion amongſt the people. The Biſhop
ſends for the perſons accuſed, and particularly thoſe whom he knew
were not againſt him, to whom he makes a remonſtrance by the
Archbiſhop of <hi>Turin,</hi> ſhewing them they had committed an action,
for which they might be juſtly puniſhed, having affronted the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
and his Lieutenant; yet their Paſtour was more inclinable to
mercy than juſtice, having reſpect to their youth; and would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
pardon all but the Authors, whom he ſaid were <hi>Berthelier</hi> and
his Confederates, deſiring them not to take part with him:
which having heard, they thanked him, and promiſed him they
would ſubmit to what he had enjoyned them, being glad they had
thus eſcaped.</p>
               <p>The Duke returned to <hi>Chambery,</hi> from whence he ſent his Brother
the Earl of <hi>Genevois,</hi> to <hi>Geneva.</hi> He makes a hunting match, and
the place appointed to meet in was at <hi>Wache.</hi> The Biſhop, the
Abbot of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> and ſeveral other perſons of quality accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, whom he liberally treated; conſulting privately with the
Biſhop about what they were ſuddenly to enterprize. The Biſhop
withdrew to a ſeat he had in <hi>Focigny</hi> called <hi>Thy,</hi> accompanied with
ſome gentlemen belonging to the Earl, whom he ſent to the Village
of <hi>Preſinge,</hi> where were two <hi>Genevoiſes, Claudius Servant,</hi> and <hi>John
Pecolat,</hi> whom having apprehended, they brought them to the Biſhop,
who committed them to Priſon; but he ſoon releaſed the firſt of
theſe, which cauſed it to be ſuſpected that the ſaid <hi>Servant</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50836:31"/>
his companion, which made him odious to the people. <hi>Pecolat</hi>
was queſtioned about the Fiſh pyes, and the words he had ſpoken,
<hi>non videbis dies Petri,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pecolat</hi> put upon the Rack.</note> it being laid to his charge that he and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
(whom they charged him to diſcover) had a deſign to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the Biſhop, he was Racked three times without confeſſing any
thing; at length the Biſhop cauſed him to be hanged up by the arms
all the time he was at Dinner, his ſervants blaming him for his folly,
in ſuffering himſelf to be thus tormented rather than confeſs the
truth; telling him, <hi>Servant</hi> had confeſſed the whole matter, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
particular perſons, amongſt others the Biſhop of <hi>Maurienne,</hi> and
the Abbot of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> whom his accomplices would make their
Biſhop, after they had diſpatched <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and entertaining
him with theſe words, they made him ſay what they pleaſed, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able any longer to endure the torments.</p>
               <p>After this the Biſhop chiefly deſired to get <hi>Berthelier</hi> into his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Berthelier</hi> ſought after by the Biſhop.</note>
but he kept in the City and ſtood upon his guard, and at length
got away, being attired like a <hi>Herald</hi> of <hi>Fribourg,</hi> where he went in
company of ſome Merchants of that <hi>Canton;</hi> the Biſhop and <hi>Vidame</hi>
hearing of his eſcape, ſummoned him publickly to appear and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to his Accuſation. He addreſſeth himſelf to the Council of
<hi>Fribourg,</hi> complaining to them of the unjuſt dealings he met with at
<hi>Geneva,</hi> adding moreover that all this had hapned to him for no other
reaſon, but becauſe he had been a Citizen of <hi>Fribourg;</hi> that they
would entreat the Council of <hi>Geneva</hi> to inform the Duke and Biſhop,
that if they would ſend any one to <hi>Fribourg</hi> to impeach him, he
would render himſelf Priſoner, or if he could obtain of them a ſafe-conduct
to make his defence at <hi>Geneva</hi> before the <hi>Syndicks</hi> his lawful
Judges he would there make his appearance, provided they of <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi>
would depute ſome perſon to be preſent at the hearing of the
Tryal: the <hi>Fribourgers</hi> granted his requeſt, and ſent an Expreſs to the
Princes, lodging <hi>Berthelier</hi> in the mean time who was but poor, in the
Hoſpital. The Meſſenger found the Princes at <hi>Geneva,</hi> who had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
come there in expectation of meeting with <hi>Berthelier.</hi> They
returned anſwer, that they would gratifie them of <hi>Fribourg</hi> in any
reaſonable requeſt, but as to the ſending one to proſecute <hi>Berthelier,</hi>
they could in no wiſe conſent to that. That if he would have Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
done he muſt come to <hi>Geneva,</hi> where he ſhould not fail of it,
provided no ſtranger aſſiſted at the Tryal, it being contrary to the
Cities priviledges, which aſſert the <hi>Syndicks</hi> to be the only Judges in
criminal Caſes, not ſuffering any others to aſſiſt at the Judgment but
their own Council.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Duke reſolves upon a journey to the <hi>Cantons</hi>
for ſome reaſons of State, particularly about the difference which
was not only at <hi>Geneva</hi> betwixt the Biſhop and the Citizens thereof,
but likewiſe betwixt the Citizens of <hi>Lauſane</hi> and their Prelate. The
Biſhop of <hi>Geneva</hi> had the Duke on his ſide, and the <hi>Genevoiſes,</hi> the
Confederate <hi>Cantons;</hi> on the contrary, the Biſhop of <hi>Lauſane</hi> had the
<hi>Cantons</hi> for him, and the people the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> for them. He
went firſt to <hi>Fribourg</hi> about <hi>Bertheliers</hi> buſineſs, fearing they might
decide the buſineſs in his favour; from whence he went to <hi>Berne</hi> to
confirm the ancient Alliances, and to add ſome new Articles. He
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50836:32"/>
had paſſed through <hi>Lauſane</hi> in his way to <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and had offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his mediation to them of that City, which they accepted; but he
deferred it till his return, after which he gave his judgment, which
was far from contenting both parties as he had promiſed himſelf; for
there was neither of them but was very much diſſatisfied: for inſtead
of calling himſelf an arbitrary Judge, he terms himſelf a natural
Judge, as if he had been their Prince and Soveraign; at which both
the Biſhop and People were ſo offended that they agreed without
him, and began to ſeek an Alliance with the <hi>Cantons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this the Duke returned to <hi>Geneva,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1517.</note> where he awhile
about <hi>Pecolat</hi> and <hi>Berthelier</hi>'s buſineſs, although his occaſions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his preſence in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and it having been ſhewed him at
<hi>Fribourg,</hi> that the Biſhop of <hi>Geneva</hi> had acted contrary to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
in impriſoning <hi>Pecolat</hi> out of the City; he therefore cauſed
him to be brought back, and to be impriſoned in the Biſhops name in
the Iſle, cauſing him to be examined again by the <hi>Syndicks;</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
his former confeſſion being before them as having been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted.
The Duke and Biſhop would have him again be put on the
Rack, but the <hi>Syndicks</hi> refuſed it without greater evidence: the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
propoſed the matter to the conſideration of ſeveral foreign Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
as well as to their own Council, to ſhew they were not carried
away by paſſion; but theſe differed in their judgment: for the Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
being led by their Maſters the Biſhops intereſt, condemned him,
and on the contrary the others acquitted him. The <hi>Syndicks</hi> whoſe
Province it was to pronounce judgment, knew not what to reſolve of,
temporizing as much as poſſible to juſtifie theſe two Lords deſire of
revenge: the Duke and Biſhop haſtning this buſineſs to a concluſion,
ſtarted a matter which they were not aware of, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
was a Clerk, and by conſequence a Subject of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Court, and belonged not to the <hi>Syndicks</hi> juriſdiction. They tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported
him then out of the Priſon of the Iſle to that of the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
where they were reſolved not to ſpare him, but being ſick, he
was viſited by the Phyſitians, to ſee whether he was able to endure
the Rack; they differed in their opinions, but they who affirmed he
was able to endure it, were ſooneſt believed; but becauſe at <hi>Thy,</hi> he
was obſerved to be very conſtant in enduring the Torment, and being
ſuſpected to have ſome Magical charm in his beard, which rendred
him inſenſible, he therefore had a Barber ſent him to ſhave him
cloſe, for his beard was very long. <hi>Pecolat</hi> in this extremity rumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his mind how to keep himſelf from being overcome by theſe
torments,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pecolat</hi> cuts out his own tongue.</note> which he ſaw were making ready for him, the Barber ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

down his Razor near him, which <hi>Pecolat</hi> ſnatching up, cut out a
great part of his tongue; the Barber ſeeing him bleeding in the mouth,
wholly aſtoniſhed called up the guards and Jaylor, notice being ſent
to the Princes of this, they took care to preſerve him for greater ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows;
being recovered, they would have him again to the Rack, and
becauſe he could not ſpeak, they would therefore have him write;
but the Epiſcopal Council could never agree, and particularly the
Judge of the Clergies exceſſes, whoſe office was to pronounce ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
being the Syndick <hi>Levrer<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50836:32"/>
much as his Father, whoſe head he at length cauſed to be cut off.
This Judge told his Friends in private, what a dreadful thing it was
to let this poor Man be ſo long miſuſed, that for his part he
would never give his conſent that he ſhould be again put on the
Rack; and that were it not out of reſpect to the Princes, he
would have long ſince acquitted him; and to procure his Releaſe
they muſt have recourſe to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> Metropolitan
of <hi>Geneva.</hi> His counſel was followed, and an Order was obtained
from <hi>Vienna,</hi> by which the Advocate of the Treaſury was cited to
give an account of the detaining of <hi>Pecolat,</hi> and forbidding him and
all other Epiſcopal Officers, yea the Biſhop himſelf, to touch the
Priſoners perſon.</p>
               <p>Which Order being brought, there was no Body found who
durſt publiſh it, although the Duke and Biſhop were not at <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va;</hi>
the bringers of theſe Acts were cudgelled for their pains:
One <hi>Bonnivard,</hi> Governor of S. <hi>Victor,</hi> was ſo bold as to carry it
to the Biſhop; this <hi>Victor</hi> was a young Man more daring than
wiſe, a Citizen of the confederate Cities, of good Kindred as well
in <hi>Savoy</hi> as <hi>Piedmont,</hi> ſo that he valued neither Duke nor Biſhop,
but hated the later, and favoured <hi>Pecolat,</hi> and was very zealous for
his Countries Liberty. He took then a Serjeant along with him,
and as the Biſhop came from parting with the Duke, he delivered
to him the Archbiſhop of <hi>Vienna</hi>'s Order. The Biſhop being galled
at it, complained to the Duke; the Duke ſent for <hi>Bonnivard,</hi> and told
him the Biſhops Complaints. To which he boldly anſwered,
<hi>My Lord, 'tis true, That the Biſhop of</hi> Geneva <hi>detains one of my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and hath put him on the Rack; and I have protected him in
acknowledgement of his Services; but what I have done is juſtifiable by
Law, having not ſuffered my ſelf to be carried away by Paſſion; neither
do I think you can take it ill that I have executed the Metropolitan's
Order; you who are a Prince, and a lover of Juſtice, and who would
not hinder Right though your own Intereſt lay at Stake.</hi> The Duke
pretended to be ſatisfied, and parted the next Morning for <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont;</hi>
having firſt cauſed <hi>Pecolat</hi> to be removed into the Caſtle of
<hi>Penay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read in the Chronicles of <hi>Geneva,</hi> That in this Year, before
the Dukes departure, the Biſhop <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> lying ſick of the
Gout, and hearing a noiſe in the Street, asked what was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
His Nurſe anſwered him, 'Twas a Thief who was led to be
Hang'd; whom (added ſhe) if you will pardon (my Lord) he
will all his life time pray for your Health; Whereupon he ſent
him his Pardon.<note place="margin">Decemb.</note> We find likewiſe an Act made this Year, in
which the <hi>Vidame</hi> is termed the Biſhops Officer, although the Duke
pretended he was his; for uſually thoſe who bore this Office were
of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop about this time ſet out for <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and after his
departure, the term allowed the Advocate of the Treaſury being
ended wherein he was to appear at <hi>Vienna,</hi> he ſtirred not, leſt he
ſhould do any thing to his Maſters diſhonour.<note place="margin">1518.</note> Whereupon he
was again cited: and at the third time this Clauſe was inſerted,
That if he did not appear, the Priſoner ſhould be releaſed, upon
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50836:33"/>
Penalty of Excommunication. And not appearing, there lacked on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Excommunication to be taken out; which being effected, it
was ſet up in the Night over the Church doors. Three Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Eaſter</hi> (in thoſe times they did the ſame for ſimple Debts)
the Chanons and Prieſts coming to ſay Maſs, found this bar forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them to go farther.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Geneva</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> The People being informed of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
began to murmur, and laſtly to gather in Tumults, exclaiming
againſt them who were the Promoters of this Excommunication.
The Clergy and dependant Officers, who made up a conſiderable
Party, ſeeing themſelves deprived of the Sacraments, joyned to
the People, and all together ſet a crying, <hi>To the</hi> Rhoſne, <hi>to the</hi>
Rhoſne <hi>with thoſe Villains and wicked Officers, who hinder us from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Syndicks</hi> ran to appeaſe them, ſeeking the Epiſcopal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
beſeeching them to releaſe <hi>Pecolat,</hi> otherwiſe they would be
expoſed to the Popular rage. They being affrighted at this, wrote
to the Lieutenant of <hi>Penay</hi> to releaſe him ſpeedily; but the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
not truſting to them, joyned with the Meſſenger to ſee <hi>Pecolat</hi>
releaſed; which fell out well for him, for immediately after came
Letters from <hi>Rome,</hi> which made void the Metropolitan of <hi>Vienna</hi>'s
Cenſures, and forbad the Priſoners enlargement. Meſſengers
were ſent to hinder the firſt Order; but the People valued not the
Popes Letters, bringing <hi>Pecolat</hi> along with them, whom they lodged
at the <hi>Gray-Friers,</hi> as in a fit place for ſhelter, where he remained
a long time before he could ſpeak, by reaſon of the mutilation of his
Tongue, but at length he recovered his Speech, at the interceſſion
of a Saint to whom he was more particularly devoted, (if we may
believe his own relation.)</p>
               <p>Whilſt they were ſoliciting his deliverance,<note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Berthelier</hi> did the
ſame at <hi>Fribourg,</hi> to be recalled from his Exile: and moreover
negotiated an Alliance between the Cities of <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
diſcourſing ſeveral of both Cities about it, ſhewing them the
advantage which would accrue thereby; and not only to them,
but to all the other Cantons, as well for the free Tranſportation of all
Merchandizes, as alſo to make uſe of <hi>Geneva</hi> as a Fortreſs againſt
their Neighbours, eſpecially againſt the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> he being
always to be ſuſpected, notwithſtanding his pretences to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
being not able to forget their Forraging his Country in the
Wars he had with the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> they having at that
time a part of it in their poſſeſſion; that by means of this Alliance
the Duke would be fruſtrated in his Deſign of Soveraignty over
<hi>Geneva;</hi> which Diſcourſes fell not to the ground, for they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into conſideration by the Council; who ſent to him, telling
him, They would procure his Safe-conduct; which having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,<note place="margin">Febr. 24.</note>
he ſhould endeavour to effect this Alliance. They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
then of the Duke and Biſhop a Safe conduct for <hi>Berthelier</hi>
to make his Defence at <hi>Geneva.</hi> He preſented himſelf to the
Epiſcopal Council, and afterwards to that of the City, requiring his
Accuſers to appear and declare what they had againſt him, and
he would endeavour by Gods aſſiſtance to clear himſelf, and make
it appear that he was an honeſt Man. This hapned awhile before
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50836:33"/>
                  <hi>Pecolat</hi> was releaſed. The <hi>Vidame,</hi> who had formerly proſecuted
him, was cited, and made his appearance before the <hi>Syndicks,</hi> with
the Solicitor <hi>Navis,</hi> who produced ſeveral Articles againſt <hi>Berthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">March 4.</note>
containing all the extravagancies and debaucheries of his youth;
which indeed were not a few; and his frequenting Seditious Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
amongſt whom he was ever the chief. He excuſed himſelf
touching this Article, alledging they were Perſons who maintained
the Liberties of the City againſt Uſurpers; that he aſſociated with
them in nothing but this their juſt deſign. Then they accuſed
him as having conſpired to take away the Biſhops life; which
they grounded upon the Confeſſion of <hi>Pecolat,</hi> and one called <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentrant.
Berthelier</hi> juſtified himſelf in this particular, alledging
that <hi>Pecolat</hi> had been illegally Impriſoned, and that this Confeſſion
had been extorted by the Rack, which he had ſuffered on ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
conjectures: And as to what concerned the other charge, it
was evident 'twas but a trick deviſed by his Adverſaries, <hi>Carmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trant</hi>
having been hired by the Biſhop (whoſe Penſionary and Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
he was) for this purpoſe. The <hi>Vidame</hi> not having ſufficient matter
againſt <hi>Berthelier,</hi> ſent every day an account of his proceedings
to the Princes who were in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> who fearing the <hi>Syndicks</hi>
would clear him, deſired them to admit ſome of their Party to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
at his Trial: But the <hi>Fribourgers</hi> having underſtood it, wrote
to the Duke how greatly they were ſurpriſed at his intention, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both himſelf and Biſhop had but lately declared, That the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
and Rights of <hi>Geneva</hi> would not ſuffer any to be Judges in
Crimianl Caſes but themſelves. The Princes perceiving that they
were diſappointed in this contrivance, offered <hi>Berthelier</hi> and his
Accomplices their Pardon, if they would requeſt it; which had
been proffered him before at <hi>Fribourg.</hi> To which he returned the
ſame Anſwer as before, That having not been guilty of any Offence,
he had no need of Pardon; wherefore he intended to ſtand by the
deciſion of Juſtice. The Princes conſidering his Trial would end
in thier diſhonour, would have Judgment ſuſpended, forbidding
them on great penalties to proceed therein, till they ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
come or ſend; which the <hi>Syndicks</hi> did to avoid the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of theſe two Lords, whom they rather feared than lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Berthelier</hi> began again privately to carry on the
Alliance with <hi>Fribourg,</hi> gaining as many Citizens on his ſide as he
could: But the Duke had ſeveral Favorites at <hi>Geneva,</hi> amongſt
whom was the <hi>Syndick Monthion,</hi> who bore a great ſway both amongſt
the Council and People. Moreover one part of the City being <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyards</hi>
by their Original, and being accuſtomed to have the Duke
for their Maſter, preferred his Dominion before the Alliance with
the <hi>Switzers,</hi> valuing their profit more than their Liberty. Two
young Men of <hi>Geneva</hi> coming to <hi>Thurin</hi> in expectation of ſome
employ, were immediately laid hold on by the Provoſt and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away to <hi>Pignerol,</hi> before the Biſhop of <hi>Geneva,</hi> who was the
Abbot of that place. They were accuſed for being <hi>Berthelier</hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices,
although one of them was his Enemy, and Son of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis</hi>
the <hi>Vidame</hi>'s Attorney; the other was <hi>John Viterman</hi> or <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet.</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:50836:34"/>
They met at firſt with gentle uſage, to make them accuſe
thoſe who were the objects of the Dukes and Biſhops ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.
But they anſwering, They knew nothing of that matter,
were again ſent back to Priſon. In the mean time <hi>Bonnivard</hi> of
S. <hi>Victor,</hi> whom we have already mentioned, paſſing through <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>
in his Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> recommended their cauſe to a Lawyer
his Friend, and wrote to them a Letter before he parted, which
he ſent to the Jaylor to deliver it to them; who conveyed it to
the Biſhop; who upon the receit thereof was exceedingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
againſt <hi>Victor,</hi> who had already occaſioned <hi>Pecolat</hi>'s Releaſe,
he therefore cauſed them to be kept cloſe Priſoners, and put them
on the Rack. The great Torments they underwent made them
confeſs the pretended Conſpiracy of <hi>Pecolat,</hi> and to bring in <hi>Victor</hi>
as a party. At the ſame time the Biſhop ſent this Depoſition to the
<hi>Syndicks,</hi> and withal, that if they would not believe it, they ſhould
ſend two Perſons to hear their Confeſſion; but not giving credit
to the matter, they ſent no Body. This forced Confeſſion declared
that <hi>Victor,</hi> with two other Perſons in cuſtody, had determined to
poyſon him; which if they could not effect, they would after this
manner one Evening come a Mumming to his Houſe, and raiſing
a quarrel, he ſhould be ſtabbed in the tumult; by which means
<hi>Victor</hi> might ſucceed him. Which plainly appeared to be ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
ſeeing <hi>Victor</hi> was not ſo familiar with the Biſhop as to
give him ſuch kind of divertiſement, being rather his profeſſed
Enemy: and farther, the Biſhoprick was not ſo eaſily obtained,
ſeeing the Abbot of <hi>Beaumont</hi> elected by the Clergy at the Peoples
requeſt, could not obtain the Papal Confirmation, who certainly
would never have gratified an Aſſaſſin.</p>
               <p>Theſe two poor Creatures then were by beheaded by the Dukes
Authority,<note place="margin">Two young Men behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</note> having publickly retracted their Confeſſion, and asked
Almighty God forgiveneſs for their other ſins. The Provoſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened
their Execution to ſilence them. Their Bodies being quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
Three of them were ſent into ſeveral parts of <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
and the Fourth part parboiled with the Heads to be ſent to <hi>Geneva.
Victor</hi> returning awhile after from <hi>Rome</hi> paſſed through <hi>Turin,</hi>
where the Biſhop had given order to have him apprehended; of
which having notice, and having many Friends, he walked near
eight days about the City to affront the Biſhop; at the end of
which he chouſed his Spies, pretending to ſtay there longer, but
took Poſt one fair Morning for <hi>Geneva;</hi> whither within a ſhort time
were brought the Heads and Quarters of the Two fore-mentioned
young Men in Two Barrels, marked with the Arms of the Earl
of <hi>Genevois</hi> the Dukes Brother: they who brought them lodged
that Night on this ſide the Bridge of <hi>Arve,</hi> and the next Morning
early they ſet them up on a Walnut-tree, with a White Croſs and
this Inſcription: <hi>Theſe are the Traitors of Geneva.</hi> The firſt who
ſaw them ran to carry the News about the Town; a great part of
which came to behold them. This was a ſad Spectacle, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Father and Mother of <hi>Navis.</hi> The Father was ſtill the
<hi>Vidame</hi>'s Solicitor againſt <hi>Berthelier,</hi> and ſaw himſelf ſo ill requited
for his Services. The good Citizens were grieved, but durſt not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50836:34"/>
ſhew their indignation, contenting themſelves only with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
of the Propoſitions made them by the Burgers of <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Council of the City,<note place="margin">Deputies ſent to the Duke.</note> as likewiſe that of the Biſhop, being
met together to conſult of the means to appeaſe the Princes, whoſe
diſpleaſure they feared, deputed the <hi>Vidame Aymé Conſilii, Michael
Nergaz,</hi> and <hi>Francis Talichet,</hi> all three of the Dukes Faction, to ſhew
the Prince in all Humility, that the City was very much amazed
that they had thus uſed Two of their Citizens, and that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of the City had given them no occaſion of offence, but if
any particular Perſon had, they might have had him puniſhed at
<hi>Geneva:</hi> and therefore deſired them to declare who had offended
them, and if they were in fault they ſhould be obliged to a ſpeedy
reparation. They departed then to find the Duke, who openly
gave them but ſlender welcome, but privately conſulted with
them as Friends, treating them with the greateſt reſpect. He ſent
them to <hi>Pignerol</hi> towards the Biſhop, who gave them as kind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment;
at length he made a Speech to them in publick to
this effect: <hi>That he was very ſenſible there were ſeveral good People
at</hi> Geneva, <hi>from whom they had received faithful Service, and which
they ſhould be ready at all times to acknowledge; but that there were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſeveral Mutinous and Seditious Perſons, guilty of the higheſt Crimes,
even of Conſpiring the Death of their Prince, of whoſe number were
theſe two who had been made Examples: that there were ſome in the
Town, who to avoid the puniſhment due to their Crimes, endeavoured
to perſwade the People to make an Alliance with</hi> Fribourg; <hi>which would
not only tend to the Princes diſadvantage, but to the City's it ſelf, which
would loſe by this means the Cuſtoms which were paid for the Carriage
of Merchandizes into</hi> Fribourg. <hi>That if the Cities did embrance this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
they would certainly moſt ſeverely puniſh the Authors of it; in
which if the body if the Town would aſſiſt them, they ſhould reſpect them
for good and faithful Subjects: adding, they deſired that the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals,
who were</hi> Berthelier <hi>and Ten or Twelve others, ſhould be puniſhed
with the greateſt ſeverity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Deputies, who had themſelves dictated this Anſwer, deſired
it ſhould be committed to Writing, being directed to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
To which the Princes conſented,<note place="margin">Deputies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Dukes Letter to the Council.</note> on condition they would
not deliver it to them till they were ſworn to execute what it
contained. They at their return offered it to the leſſer Council;
the greateſt part of which liked not the condition, ſaying, There
might be perhaps ſomething which reſpected the publick Intereſt,
and therefore they could reſolve of nothing without the general
Council, which was aſſembled the next Morning, where the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
appearing, related they had no other Anſwer than that
which was contained in the Letter, and that they had in charge
not to open it but upon the fore-mentioned condition. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
would not agree to the Propoſal touching the Oath, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to ſend back again the Letter whence it came. <hi>Nergaz</hi>
then tells them, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> ſay he, <hi>The Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
That if his Letter be not read, and the Contents obſerved, no</hi>
Genevoiſe <hi>ſhall enjoy his Poſſeſſions in ſafety.</hi> The People inraged
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50836:35"/>
at this cried to the Deputies, <hi>Have you ſtaid five or ſix weeks on the other
ſide the Mounts, making your ſelves merry at our coſt to bring us this news?
To the</hi> Rhoſne, <hi>to the</hi> Rhoſne, <hi>with ſuch Traitors;</hi> and it wanted but little
but they had been ſacrificed to the popular fury, but for fear of the
Princes the Council appeaſed them: they returned the Letter to the
Deputies, after they had ſeverely reproached them with it, bidding
them do what they would with it, for it ſhould not be read on the
condition offered.</p>
               <p>This advanced not a little the deſign of the Alliance with <hi>Fribourg,</hi>
it being the only private and publick diſcourſe of the Town,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Beſancon Hugues</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome others make an Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Fribourgers.</hi>
                  </note> but all
would not conſent to it; ſo that <hi>Beſançon Huges</hi> one of the <hi>Syndicks,</hi> and
ſeveral of the Council approved of it, and had ſeveral meetings
about it with thoſe who were men of courage and reſolution. They
concluded that if a general Alliance could not be effected, there
ſhould be a particular one made in behalf of thoſe who had ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to the number of three hundred, with charge to the Deputies, to
confer abut it with thoſe <hi>Fribourgers</hi> on whom <hi>Berthelier</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
which was done not without oppoſition from them who were
Penſioners to the Duke, for he had ſuch as well in <hi>Fribourg</hi> as <hi>Geneva.</hi>
The Deputies had this anſwer both from the great and leſſer Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils:
that if the City, or at leaſt the greateſt part of it would make
ſuch a contract, it ſhould be accepted on reaſonable terms, provided
no foreign claim hindred them, eſpecially that of the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi>
for if <hi>Geneva</hi> was ſubject to him, this could not be done without vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olating
the Alliance with him; they then would be ready to conſent
to this Alliance or Burgerſhip, and from that time would protect
them as their own Citizens. The Deputies returned with an Expreſs
from <hi>Fribourg,</hi> to make relation of their negotiation; ſome accepted it,
others refuſed it; ſo that this heated them one againſt another, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the remonſtrances made them by the Deputy of <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg.</hi>
There were continually ſeen Aſſemblies of both parties, which
day and night circuiting about the Town, made ſongs of one another,
with mutual gibes and reproaches.</p>
               <p>Thoſe on the Dukes ſide termed them who had accepted the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerſhip

by an Oath, it being the ſame the firſt <hi>Switzers</hi> made uſe of when
they mutually aſſiſted one another againſt the Tyrannical uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the gentrv of their Country, and from hence hath ſprung the
word <hi>Huguenots,</hi> of which there hath been ſuch different and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Etymologies: for ſome affirm that this term <hi>Huguenot</hi> came
from the two firſt words which were delivered in an Harangue of
ſome deputed <hi>Switzers</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> King, beginning thus, <hi>Huc nos
venimus.</hi> Others imagine it is derived from a certain Gate called
<hi>Hugon,</hi> in I know not what City, near the which Gate they held the
firſt Synod; the learned <hi>Monſieur Peteau,</hi> found out another original
derivation, as I have read in the Memoires of <hi>M. de Pieresk.</hi> He tells
us then that at <hi>Tours</hi> or <hi>Amboisé,</hi> where as is pretended this name firſt
began to be uſed, the people have a tradition of I know not what
kind of ſpirit who ran in the night about the ſtreets, whom they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Frier <hi>Bourru,</hi> and afterward King <hi>Hugues</hi> Ghoſt. It is well known
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50836:35"/>
the Proteſtants at firſt went only to hear Sermons by night, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to aſſemble in the day, and for that reaſon were called <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi>
which is as much as to ſay Spirits; people who appeared only
in the night like King <hi>Hugue</hi>'s Ghoſt: but the true Etymology is that
which we have already given; they who underſtand not the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Language differently pronounce it. The Boys of the Town ran about
the ſtreets hollowing, <hi>Long live the</hi> Eignots. The note of diſtinction
was a Croſs marked on their Doublet. They called the Dukes party
<hi>Mammeluſſes</hi> by the name of thoſe Souldiers who were the Soudan of
<hi>Egypt</hi>'s ſlaves, who having been Chriſtians had renounced their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
and abjured the liberty of their Country to joyn with Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants;
deſigning by this name to accuſe them of the Dukes faction of
the ſame baſeneſs, and from hence hath ſprung the Original of theſe
factions which laſted ſeveral years. Theſe <hi>Eidgnots</hi> aſſembled in
the night, took upon them to watch the City, and feaſted one
another.</p>
               <p>Which the Princes underſtanding ſent Embaſſadors to <hi>Fribourg</hi> to
make their complaints,<note place="margin">The Princes complain againſt the Burgerſhip.</note> ſaying, they perverted their Subjects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the ancient Alliances, in admitting them Citizens,
entreating the Magiſtrates to deſiſt; to which they anſwered,
that they had not done any thing to the prejudice of their former
agreements with them in treating with <hi>Geneva,</hi> for as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the Biſhop, they had no Alliance with him, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
might contract with the Citizens, who although they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
him their Prince, yet did not that hinder them from being free
and at their own diſpoſal, he having accepted them upon this, and
not any other condition; yet would they do him no wrong, for if he
could prove them of <hi>Geneva</hi> to be others than what they termed
themſelves, the Alliance ſhould be void; that they were ſo far from
diminiſhing his Eccleſiaſtical Authority, that they were rather on the
contrary for maintaining of it to the utmoſt of their power, and as
to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> they would make a reſerve in what concerned
his Rights in the Treaty, and that if he could make it appear the City
was ſubject to him, they would proceed no farther. And laſtly, if
both of them had found themſelves aggrieved, they were content to
ſtand to the judgment which ſhould be given, and not to act contrary
to their Alliance.</p>
               <p>The Deputies from <hi>Savoy</hi> not ſatisfied with this came to <hi>Geneva,</hi>
where by flattery and threatnings they required there ſhould be no
farther contracting of Burgerſhip, and after all their endeavours per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
they could not obtain their deſign, they complained againſt
the <hi>Fribourgers</hi> in the general Aſſembly of the Conſedrate <hi>Cantons,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
the wrong which was done the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in admitting
them of <hi>Geneva</hi> into the Burgerſhip of their City, ſeeing they were his
ſubjects; which was contrary to former Treaties: for ſuppoſing the
<hi>Genevoiſes</hi> were not his ſubjects, yet were they comprehended under
the title of <hi>Hinderſaſſen,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, <hi>inhabitants of
their own Country,</hi> which the Treaties of Alliance forbad to change in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Burgerſhip. The Deputies of <hi>Geneva</hi> anſwered that their City
had never been ſubject to the Duke or any of his Predeceſſors; that
by this word <hi>Hinderſaſſen,</hi> was not ſo much meant a City ſurrounded
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50836:36"/>
by his Countrys, as ſtrangers ſetled in his Dominions; that it was
rather the Duke who dwelt with them, ſeeing the Country he held
about <hi>Geneva</hi> had heretofore belonged to the Biſhop, of whom the
Dukes held it, for the confirmation of which they produced their
Titles. Theſe conteſts and proceedings held a long time before the
War broke out.</p>
               <p>The Abbot of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> and <hi>Francis Bonnivard</hi> Prior of S. <hi>Victor,</hi>
young Citizens, were zealous for the liberty of their Country; they
together with ſeveral others ſent to <hi>Fribourg,</hi> to requeſt the priviledge
of Burgerſhip; which was granted them upon condition the general
Council of <hi>Geneva</hi> conſented to it, which was ſworn to by the
greater number of ſuffrages which carried it.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Duke and Biſhop united in their intereſt,<note place="margin">May 7.</note>
gave Commiſſion dated at <hi>Montcallier,</hi> to the <hi>Sieur de Salleneufve,</hi> a
man expert in buſineſs, to be their temporal Deputy in <hi>Geneva,</hi> but
the Citizens refuſed him, alledging it to be a new and unheard of
thing to ſend them a Governor, ſeeing they never had any before
but their Biſhop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Berthelier</hi> had ſtill ſollicited for a definitive judgement of his Caſe,<note place="margin">1519.</note>
                  <note place="margin">Feb. 24.</note>
which had been ſuſpended by the Biſhops command;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Berthelier</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted by the City.</note> but after the
Alliance made with <hi>Fribourg,</hi> he was no more fear'd, the City de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
ſhe would reaſſume her liberty; and that it belonged to the
<hi>Syndicks,</hi> and not to the Biſhop, to try <hi>Berthelier.</hi> He was judged in
the preſence of the <hi>Vidame,</hi> and a definitive ſentence pronounced in
theſe Terms. That as to what concerned the Crime of High Treaſon,
having examined the proofs, they were found invalid, and therefore
they acquitted him; declaring him innocent of this crime: but
touching the exceſſes he had committed, ſuch as Aſſaults and Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
they had Fined him according to the tenour of the Statute in that
caſe provided.</p>
               <p>Some days after Duke <hi>Charles</hi> the third, fearing leſt the Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which he had began againſt the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> before the <hi>Cantons,</hi>
ſhould turn to his prejudice, and that inſtead of acknowledging him
for their Prince,<note place="margin">The Duke raiſes an Army.</note> they ſhould pretend he was their Vaſſal, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to deal with them after a more violent manner. He raiſed
then ſecretly an Army beyond the mountains, that the <hi>Fribourgers</hi>
might take no notice of it, and the better to conceal his deſign he ſent
the Preſident <hi>Lambert</hi> to the <hi>Cantons,</hi> deſiring the buſineſs might be
friendlily ended. The <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> having gotten intimation of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
diſpatched <hi>Beſancon Hugues,</hi> and <hi>John Malbuiſſon</hi> to <hi>Fribourg;</hi>
but <hi>Lambert</hi> entertained the <hi>Fribourgers</hi> with ſuch fair ſpeeches, that
they knew not whom to credit; he endeavoured alſo to perſwade
<hi>Beſancon Huges</hi> who was his kinſman, that his Maſter had no ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;
which cauſed <hi>Hugues</hi> to be ſuſpected of corrupt dealings.
In the mean time the Duke had gathered an Army of ſix or ſeven
thouſand men at S. <hi>Julien,</hi> before the <hi>Fribourgers</hi> could be perſwaded
to believe any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>He ſent immediately an Herald to the <hi>Syndicks</hi> called <hi>Chablais,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An Herald ſent to <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </note> who
required that the Council ſhould be aſſembled, which being done, he
was introduced. He had on his left arm, a Coat of Arms, and a wand
in his right hand, and entered after this manner without diſcovering
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50836:36"/>
himſelf, or ſo much as ſaluting the Council, he was requeſted to
ſeat himſelf by the <hi>Syndicks,</hi> and make known his Meſſage, which he
thrice refuſed; but at length he ſat down not by the <hi>Syndicks,</hi> but in a
ſeat above them, and ſpake to them as follows: <hi>Let it not ſeem ſtrange
to you, O ye</hi> Lords, Syndicks <hi>and</hi> Council <hi>of</hi> Geneva, <hi>if I would not ſit
down at your command, and that I do it now of my own accord, for this is
the reaſon; I am come here from the part of my moſt dread Prince, yours and
my Lord and Maſter, the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>whom it belongeth not to you
to bid ſit down, but to him to ſit where and when he ſhall think fitting, above
you, as your Soveraign Prince and Lord, and as repreſenting his Perſon I
have done. So from my ſeat I make known to you my Meſſage, which is,
That he biddeth and commandeth you to make ready his Lodgings in the
State-houſe, with that ſplendor and magnificence which becometh a Prince
of his quality; likewiſe that you furniſh him and his company with victuals,
which are about ten thouſand footmen, beſides horſe: for he deſigns to come
in this equipage to do Juſtice:</hi> Which ſpoken, he was deſired to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
till they had conſulted on the anſwer to be returned him,
which he did, and awhile after he was recalled, and anſwer made
him in theſe words.</p>
               <p>We are equally ſurprized, <hi>Seigneur Chablais,</hi> at what you ſay and do:
when we offered you a ſeat, you refuſed it, and after your refuſal have taken
it of your own accord, ſaying, you did it as repreſenting the perſon of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> your Prince and ours: That he is your Prince we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
but not ours; for although we reckon our ſelves his humble ſervants,
yet are we not his Subjects or Vaſſals, nor do we underſtand upon what
ground it is pretended: yea, we are willing to believe that he is a more duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Son to his mother our holy Church, to whom we have ſubmitted our
ſelves, than to uſurp her juriſdiction; ſo that it belongeth neither to him,
nor to you repreſenting him, to ſit where you do. As to that part of your
Meſſage whereby you command us to prepare his Lodgins in the Town-houſe,
and not only Lodging for him, but for ten thouſand foot, beſides
horſemen, adding that he will come hither to do Juſtice: truly we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
not the meaning of it, for he did not uſe to lodge in the Town-houſe,
much leſs with ſuch a kind of attendance; and if his coming be as you ſay to
do Juſtice, there is no need of ſo great multitude. For it belongeth not to
him to do it here, but to the Biſhop, Syndicks and Council, according to the
Cuſtoms and Priviledges which he hath ſworn to obſerve; and if there be
any one amongſt us who hath done him or any perſon elſe any wrong, we are
ready to do him all the right he can deſire; but our Kitchin is not large
enough to entertain all his Company, yet if be pleaſes to come with his uſual
train, nay were there five hundred men more than ordinary, he ſhould as
heretofore be welcome, and chuſe what Lodgings beſt pleaſe him, except our
Town-houſe, which we cannot ſpare; he ſhall be entertained if not according
to his merit, yet according to the beſt of his power.</p>
               <p>Which Diſcourſe ended, the <hi>Herald</hi> replied, <hi>Gentlemen, you will
not then great my Lord his requeſt, nor obey his commands. No,</hi> ſaid they.
Whereupon he put on his Coat of Arms, and told them from himſelf,
<hi>I declare you to be Rebels to your Prince with fire and ſword, and for a proof
of this, I throw before you this Wand, let him that dares take it up.</hi> Which
ſaying, he threw it in the middle of the Hall, and went his way. He
had no ſooner departed, but twelve Gentlemen booted and ſpurred,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50836:37"/>
who came on the ſame errand, entred into the Council Chamber, and
ſpake thus to them, <hi>Syndicks and Council of</hi> Geneva, <hi>reſolve to obey my
Lord, otherwiſe you will have cauſe to repent.</hi> Which they had no
ſooner ſaid but they ſet ſpurrs to their horſes and departed.</p>
               <p>The Syndicks and Council ſhewed to the people what had hapned,
at which they were much amazed; yet the greateſt part conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
either they muſt be ſlaves or loſe their lives, generouſly choſe the
latter, reſolving to ſell their lives at a dear rate. The <hi>Syndicks</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to Arm themſelves, conſtraining the Dukes faction to
do the like; the Gates were ſhut, the Chains extended, and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
placed. The Duke having received his anſwer by the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald,</hi>
drew near to <hi>Geneva,</hi> coming to <hi>Gaillard</hi> with all his Army,
which encreaſed by the addition of thoſe of <hi>Chablais</hi> and <hi>Focigny;</hi> he
blocked up the paſſages leſt any thing ſhould be carried in or out of
the City.</p>
               <p>Yet the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> ventured to ſend a Meſſenger to <hi>Fribourg</hi> to
give them notice of their condition; but he was taken at <hi>Verſoy,</hi> and
led to <hi>Gex,</hi> where he under went the Strappado, to make him give an
account of the ſtate <hi>Geneva.</hi> A Merchant named <hi>Marmet</hi> returning
out of <hi>Germany</hi> had the ſame uſage.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops Officers and Chanons would needs make tryal what
they could do to keep off this tempeſt which threatned the Town,
ſaying,<note place="margin">The <hi>Fribour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> ſend an <hi>Herald</hi> to the Duke.</note> they would go to the Duke to try whether they could appeaſe
him. The Gates were opened then, and they were accompanied
with ſeveral Citizens of the Duke factions. In the mean time
the <hi>Fribourgers</hi> finding the paſſages to <hi>Geneva</hi> blocked up, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
they underſtood the Dukes deſign, and therefore ſent in
haſt to him <hi>Frederick Marty</hi> with an <hi>Herald,</hi> to know his pretenſions;
for if he injured <hi>Geneva</hi> either in general or particular, they would
reſent it. <hi>Marty</hi> arrived at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and was much aſtoniſhed to find
affairs in ſuch a poſture, his coming bringing along with it ſmall
conſolation, they having more need of Soldiers than Deputies. He
comforted them the beſt he could, departing immediately to expoſe
his charge to the Duke. A Deputy from <hi>Zurich</hi> who was going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Dukes anſwer to the Deputies.</note> accompanied him; and both addreſſed themſelves to the
Duke, who was then at <hi>Gallard</hi> upon the point of terminating the
buſineſs with the Chanons. He at firſt entertained them but ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and gave <hi>Marty</hi> ſome contemptible terms; at length by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of his Council, he anſwered that he had determined to enter into
<hi>Geneva,</hi> not to injure the Town or any particular perſon of it; but
to aſſiſt it to the utmoſt of his power: that having been informed of
their diſſentions, he very much feared their ruin, in whoſe deſtruction,
his Country muſt bear a part: for this cauſe he deſigned to come into
the City to make them agree by fair means, or otherwiſe by force:
that his Cannon lay ready againſt the City in caſe of reſiſtance;
which indeed was falſe, he having not one piece throughout his whole
Army bigger than an ordinary Musket; and that they would do well
to perſwade the <hi>Syndicks</hi> to come to a parly with him, that ſo they
might appeaſe theſe quarrels without further tumult, and for this
purpoſe there ſhould be no act of hoſtility offered during that night.
The Deputy returned to <hi>Geneva</hi> with this anſwer, which he imparted
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50836:37"/>
by his <hi>Herald</hi> whom he ſent poſt to <hi>Fribourg</hi> to his Maſters, ſending
after him a footman, to the end that if one failed, the other might paſs.
In the mean time they promiſed themſelves ſecurity for that night
upon <hi>Marty</hi>'s mediation with the Duke, but the Earl of <hi>Genevois</hi> the
Dukes brother, marched up as far as S. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Gate, whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> alarm'd
the City, and a lighted Torch was ſeen on the Pinacle of the Steeple
which ſome of the Dukes party had ſet there for a Signal. All the
Citizens put themſelves in Arms, but they were ſo little experienced
in Martial affairs, that every one forſook the place he was poſted in,
to run where the alarm was given, as if they enemy could enter no
where elſe.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were doing, there was heard three dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
claps of Thunder, the laſt of which fell on the Dukes houſe at
<hi>Gaillard,</hi> and was ſo extraordinary, that it aſtoniſhed both parties,
who attributed to it ſome bad preſage.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> conſulted with the Deputy of <hi>Fribourg,</hi> whether
they ſhould give the Duke entrance, to which he anſwered, <hi>The
Duke your Enemy is with his Army and Artillery at your Gates, and my Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors
your friends will not ſee you wronged; but I know not whether they can
come timely enough:</hi> at the hearing of which they all threw down their
Arms, as if the City had been already taken. The <hi>Syndicks</hi> with the
Deputy went the next morning to the Duke at <hi>Gaillard,</hi> and agreed
he ſhould enter into <hi>Geneva</hi> with his Train, and five hundred men for
his Guard, promiſing to hurt no body: which being concluded, all the
Gates were opened, and the Chains taken down; the Duke declaring
there ſhould enter with him but five hundred men,<note place="margin">The Duke enters with his Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </note> and that he
would make no long ſtay there. But the Earl his brother entred
firſt through S. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Gate, armed from head to foot well moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and after him ſeveral Companies of Foot; he cauſed the Gate
to be thrown down, that the Duke might paſs over it as in triumph.
The Duke entered likewiſe armed at all points, but his head; his
Page <hi>James de Vatteville,</hi> who was afterwards made <hi>Avoyer</hi> of <hi>Berne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">March 6.</note>
carried his headpiece.</p>
               <p>The Prior of S. <hi>Victor</hi> not truſting to the Dukes promiſe, got imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
out of the City, but at <hi>Vaud</hi> he fell into the hands of two falſe
friends <hi>Francis Champion, Sieur</hi> of <hi>Vanbrun,</hi> whom he truſted as a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and a Monk named <hi>Briſſet,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Montheron,</hi> who carried
him to <hi>Eſchallans,</hi> which was ſubject to the two Cities of <hi>Berne</hi> and
<hi>Fribourg,</hi> and delivered him to the Duke, who cauſed him to be
tranſported to <hi>Gex,</hi>

                     <hi>Victor</hi> impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned.</note> and from thence to <hi>Groleé,</hi> where he kept him
two years priſoner.</p>
               <p>The Duke then being entred <hi>Geneva,</hi> brought in not only thoſe he
mentioned, but his whole Army. The Earl of <hi>Genevois</hi> took up his
quarters in the Town-houſe, and at two of the Clock in the night he
commanded them to deliver him the Keys of the Gates, their Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and other Ammunition; in this Conſternation he was refuſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
He quartered his men in this manner, <hi>Montrotier</hi> with his

to be given, which made theſe paltry Raſcals hide themſelves
up and down in holes. <hi>Montrotier</hi> cauſed the Chain poſts to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up, and to be carried to the Dukes quarters, who to compleat
the Citizens mortification, cauſed to be proclaimed in the chief parts
of the City, the next morning after his arrival, <hi>Our Sovereign Lord the

               <p>They who were not in favor kept themſelves cloſe; ſome there

the Dukes order, but were forced to undergo the penalty, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſo that they immediately grew to the number of ſix or ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

They carried him along with them, and entred in <hi>Morges</hi> without the

the Lake. They encamped there, and <hi>Lulins</hi> advertiſed his Highneſs

the Duke gave him at <hi>Gaillard,</hi> anſwered him, <hi>Sir, do you believe ſuch
a man as I can do this?</hi> and continuing his jargon of <hi>Fribourg, Alas Sir,</hi>
ſays he, <hi>would you have me go to my Lords and Superiors to carry your Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
pray employ your own ſervants to carry your jokes, for my part I
will not do it, you have not kept your promiſe with men or my Superiors, no
more will you now.</hi> In ſhort he refuſed.</p>
               <p>The Duke ſeeing this, left him, yet ſent his Deputies, who in a
ſhort time arrived at <hi>Morges,</hi> and demanded of the Captains where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they came in a hoſtile manner into the Dukes Country; to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50836:38"/>
which they returned the ſame anſwer, why they had entred <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi>
their confederate City, in Arms. Which when the Duke
had heard, he commanded his Deputies to go to the other <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi>
to intreat them to ſend to the <hi>Fribourgers</hi> to retire.</p>
               <p>The Duke Army all the while lay upon the <hi>Genevoiſes,</hi> and
that of <hi>Fribourg</hi> at <hi>Morges,</hi> and in the reſt of the Country of <hi>Vaud,</hi>
which was ſubject to the Duke. 'Twas in the time of <hi>Lent:</hi> and
becauſe all Proviſion was ſcarce but Herrings, ſome termed this
Campagne, <hi>The War of Herrings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke aſſembled at <hi>Genevat</hi> he General Council, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
two things: Firſt that they ſhould renounce the Bourgerſhip of
<hi>Fribourg,</hi> and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd into the Camp as from the body of the Town,
to aſſure them that neither the Duke, nor any of his Men, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
any outrage, to occaſion their coming in ſo Hoſtile a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
That <hi>Hogues</hi> and <hi>Malbuiſſon</hi> had not been ſent by them as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Deputies, but that they went of their own Authority with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Councils leave. All which was granted him, becauſe they
dared not do otherwiſe, and they ſent whom he was pleaſed to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate.
But when they came to <hi>Morges,</hi> the <hi>Fribourgers</hi> and the
other <hi>Cantons</hi> gave no credit to them, becauſe the former Deputies
had ſhewed them the contrary.<note place="margin">Articles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Duke and <hi>Fribourgers.</hi>
                  </note> Yet the buſineſs was ſo throughly
proſecuted, that an agreement was concluded on theſe following
conditions: Firſt, Becauſe the <hi>Fribourgers</hi> required 15000 Crowns
to defray their Expences in coming, they ſhould have 4000 paid
them in hand, and ſhould return without hurting the Country,
only Victualling as they paſſed on free coſt. Secondly, That the
Duke on his part ſhould draw out his Army from <hi>Geneva,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
damnifying the City either in general or particular, leaving
it in full poſſeſſion of its former priviledges; and concerning other
differences, they ſhould be decided as heretofore. The difficulty
lay in providing the 4000 Crowns, for the Duke would not pay
them nor the <hi>Genevoiſes:</hi> but the Prince having called the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council, they were forced to engage for the payment of 2000
of them, and for the other half the Earl of <hi>Genevoiſe</hi> delivered his
Plate to the <hi>Fribourgers,</hi> upon condition the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
it the next S. <hi>James</hi>'s and S. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>'s day. So the two
Armies withdrew, but the Duke ſtaid behind at <hi>Geneva,</hi> till the
Plague, which ſwept away ſeveral of the People, obliged him to
retire to <hi>Thonon;</hi> and immediately after <hi>Hugues</hi> and <hi>Malbuiſſon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Geneva,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Duke ſends for <hi>Hugues</hi> and <hi>Malbuiſſon.</hi>
                  </note> believing themſelves ſecure; yet the Duke ſent
for them to <hi>Thonon,</hi> by the <hi>Vidame Conſilii,</hi> whom that he might
the more eaſily perſwade to go along with him, he brought them
a Letter of Safe conduct. They knowing the Dukes temper,
would not carry his Letter with them, but left it with <hi>Hugues</hi>'s
Wife, enjoyning her, if ſhe heard they were detained, to ſend it ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
to <hi>Fribourg.</hi> They went then with the <hi>Vidame,</hi> who believed
he had them ſafe enough, and that they might eaſily be diſpatched
when their Letter of Safe-conduct was taken away from them.
They had ſcarcely gotten half a mile from the City, but he asked
them whether they had it not about them? They anſwered him,
they had not; at which the <hi>Vidame</hi> falling into a paſſion replied,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50836:39"/>
                  <hi>Wretches, as you are, wherefore have you ſet out then? How dare ye
appear without it before my Lord, who ye know is enraged againſt you?
and if any miſhap ſhould befal you, you would not receieve more hurt
than I ſhould diſhonour. Return and fetch it then, otherwiſe I will not
go along with you. Truly, Mr.</hi> Vidame (replied they) <hi>we can go
no where to fetch it, but at</hi> Fribourg <hi>where we have ſent it as ſoon as we
received it, to the end if your Lord ſhould miſuſe us, he ſhould have in
requital at leaſt ſome trouble for violating his Faith. But if you are for
returning to</hi> Geneva, <hi>with all our hearts, for we had rather be with our
Wives and Children than to go turn Courtiers.</hi> To which the <hi>Vidame</hi>
replied, Well if it be ſo, we had as good continue our journey; my
Lord hath paſſed his word, which is of more value than a Letter.
They kept on then their way, and being arrived at <hi>Thonon,</hi> the
firſt word the Duke gave them was, Whether they had the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Safe-conduct? but was vexed when he heard them anſwer
no. He committed them to the keeping of the Provoſt of his
Houſhold, forbidding them to be ſuffered to ſpeak to any body but
in preſence of the Guards. The Provoſt led them to his Houſe,
ſounding them about the ſecret concerns of the Town, where in the
way they were followed by the clamors of the rabble, who cried
out they ſhould be thrown into the River.</p>
               <p>The Duke ſeeing all his endeavours could not obtain from them
their Safe conduct, diſmiſſed them, having firſt made them ſwear
on the Altar of S. <hi>Hippolyte,</hi> Patron of the place, not to think any
more on the Burgerſhip of <hi>Fribourg,</hi> nor to do any thing againſt his
Authority, nor to concern themſelves in affairs of the State, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his conſent: and moreover made them to do him great ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
A while after he ſent to the Council of <hi>Geneva,</hi> that they
ſhould borrow mony in <hi>Switzerland</hi> to redeem his Brothers Plate.
The City ſent in effect Secretary <hi>Porral,</hi> who had been a <hi>Syndick,</hi>
and gave him <hi>Monathon</hi> for his guide, with the City Seal, to ſign the
Obligation. But paſſing through the Country of <hi>Vaud,</hi> this Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
was taken and carried to <hi>Thonon,</hi> and being examined where the
Letters lay relating to the Burgerſhip of <hi>Fribourg,</hi> the Secretary
through fear revealed it; upon which the Duke ſent immediately to
<hi>Geneva,</hi> to demand them. Anſwer was returned him, They dared
not enter in the Town-houſe, becauſe a Servant-maid had lately
died of the Plague there. But being not ſatisfied with this anſwer,
he reiterated his demand, that notwithſtanding he would have them,
ſo that they were forced to obey him. This done he releaſed <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
and ſuffered him to continue on his Journy with <hi>Monathon.</hi>
They met with mony upon intereſt at <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Lucerne</hi> to redeem the
Earls Plate.</p>
               <p>In <hi>May</hi> there was a general meeting of the <hi>Cantons</hi> at <hi>Zurich,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1519.</note>
where the Duke and Deputies of <hi>Geneva</hi> promiſed to ſtand by their
deciſion;<note place="margin">May.</note> which was as follow: That the Duke henceforward
ſhould not attempt any thing againſt the Biſhop and Cities Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
That the Burgerſhip of <hi>Fribourg</hi> and <hi>Geneva</hi> ſhould be
ſuſpended, neither party making any uſe of it; and that the <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgers</hi>
ſhould reſt ſatisfied with the 4000 Crowns received for
their aſſiſtance, for they claimed more. This ſecond Peace was
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50836:39"/>
thus concluded betwixt the Duke and two Cities, and laſted Six
years with much ado. The <hi>Eidgnots</hi> and <hi>Mammeluſſes</hi> began to be
reconciled, and feaſted one another, making Alliances by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and forgetting ancient differeces.</p>
               <p>The Duke conſidering <hi>Berthelier</hi> as a perſon who ever withſtood
his Intereſt in <hi>Geneva,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> reſolved to leave no means untried to be
rid of him: but being deſirous not to appear in it himſelf, he
would therefore make uſe of the Biſhops name, who was wholly
at his ſervice.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Berthelier</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, by the Duke.</note> To which end he ſent ſeveral of his Subjects from
<hi>Focigny</hi> to <hi>Geneva,</hi> who joyning with the <hi>Mammeluſſes,</hi> lodged at
the <hi>Eidgnots,</hi> and made almoſt as much diſorder as the Army had
done heretofore. All which had no other end but to take <hi>Berthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier.</hi>
He was ſenſible of it, every one giving him warning; yet he
valued it not, declaring he was ſo far from fearing Death, as he
rather deſired it, as a Haven of reſt after all his troubles. He had
a Garden out of Town, where he went every day to walk, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
along with him a Squirrel in his Boſom, with which he was
wont to recreate himſelf. Three days after the arrival of them of
<hi>Forigny,</hi> the <hi>Vidame Conſilii,</hi> with his attendants, had gotten before
him in expectation of his coming. <hi>Berthelier</hi> ſaw him making to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, and not being at all daunted at it, kept on his way.
The <hi>Vidame</hi> laid hold on him in the Biſhops name, according as
he was ordered, and took away his Sword. <hi>Berthelier</hi> boldly bid
him keep it well; for ſaid he, <hi>You ſhall give an account of it.</hi> He
was carried to the Iſle, no body interpoſing, and had Guards aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
him: whereas he to ſhew how little he was concerned,
commonly diverted himſelf with his Squirrel. They adviſed him
to beg my Lords pardon. <hi>What Lord?</hi> ſaid he. The Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> replied they, our Prince and yours. <hi>He is not my Prince,</hi>
anſwered he, <hi>and if he were, I would not ask Pardon, being innocent.
It belongeth to Malefactors to beg Pardon, not to honeſt Men.</hi> You
muſt die then, ſaid they to him ſeveral times; but he, without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
them, wrote on the Priſon-wall: <hi>Non moriar, ſed vivam
&amp; narrabo opera Domini.</hi> That is, I ſhall not die, but live and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the Works of the Lord.</p>
               <p>The firſt day of his Impriſonment there were ſent to examine
him, not the <hi>Syndicks,</hi> but a Provoſt made in haſte, who had been
heretofore a Tooth drawer, called <hi>John des Bois;</hi> (An honeſt Man
would not have accepted a Commiſſion of that nature.) who
gave him notice, that he was commanded by the Prince to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
him, and to require his Oath. <hi>Berthelier</hi> boldly replied,
When the <hi>Syndicks,</hi> who are my Judges, ſhall queſtion me, I will
anſwer them, but not thee, who haſt nothing to do in the matter.
The Provoſt ſummoned him to deliver his anſwer the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſent Poſte to the Princes to advertize them of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
The next Morning the ſaid Provoſt, accompanied with
them of <hi>Focigny,</hi> marched in Battle-array, carrying along with them
a Confeſſor and an Executioner, to the Priſon, wherein was <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelier,</hi>
where his company drew up the Bridge. The Provoſt
commanded him again to make his anſwer. Whereto he replied, He
would not. The Provoſt added, Then I command you on penalty
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50836:40"/>
of loſing your head; and <hi>Berthelier</hi> anſwering as before, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
this Sentence againſt him: <hi>Seeing then,</hi> Philbert Berthelier,
<hi>that is in this, ſo in other matters, thou haſt always ſhewed thy ſelf rebel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lious
againſt mine and thy dread Soveraign, having been guilty of the
Crime of High Treaſon, and ſeveral other matters worthy of death,
according to the Tenor of thy Indictment and Accuſation: We therefore
Sentence thee to have thy Head cut off, and thy Body to be hanged on
the Gibbet of</hi> Champel, <hi>and thy Head to be ſet upon a Spike, and
faſtned upon a Gallows near the River of</hi> Arve. Which Sentence thus
pronounced,<note place="margin">Auguſt 5.</note> he offered him the Confeſſor, with whom he had not
much diſcourſe. Afterwards he was delivered to the Executioner,
who led him out of the Caſtle, in a place betwixt the Tower and
Bridge; where, having made a ſhort Prayer, he would have made
a Speech to the Citizens before he died; but the Provoſt would
not ſuffer him, bidding the Executioner, <hi>Diſpatch, and do his Office.</hi>
The Hangman cauſed him to kneel down, which <hi>Berthelier</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Berthelier</hi> Executed.</note> he cried out, <hi>Ah! Gentlemen of Geneva;</hi> which he had
ſcarcely ſaid before his Head dropped on the Ground. which
done, the Executioner put his Body in a Hearſe, on which he got
up, holding in his Hand <hi>Berthelier</hi>'s Head, and crying out to the
People, <hi>Behold the Head of the Traitor</hi> Berthelier, <hi>take all of you exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by him.</hi> Beſides the Soldiers, who were ſtrangers, there were ſome
of the Town who followed the Hearſe, and made a mock at their
own evils: but good People kept within doors. The Head was
ſet up near the Heads of <hi>Navis</hi> and <hi>Viterman,</hi> and ſome years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it was taken down and buried in Holy Ground by ſome Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
from <hi>Fribourg</hi> who paſſed by that way. There have been
ſome, who conſidering the Heroical conſtancy of <hi>Berthelier,</hi> and
the tyranny of his Judges, have given him this Epitaph:
<q>
                     <l>Quid mihi mors nocuit? virtus poſt fata vireſcit.</l>
                     <l>Nec cruce, nec ſaevigladio perit illa Tyranni.</l>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <l>How can death hurt? ſince virtue death ſurvives,</l>
                     <l>And Tyranny of Gibbets, Swords, or Knives.</l>
                  </q>
His death affrighted them of <hi>Geneva,</hi> who did not then dare to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Duke and Biſhop any thing; but it enraged the <hi>Fribourgers,</hi>
who had a great deſire to revenge it. Yet they thought it not
convenient to raiſe an Army every time the Duke gave them
cauſe of offence, they made their complaints to the <hi>Cantons,</hi> and
demanded their Pay due to them for the former Levies, and that he
ſhould give them ſatisfaction for <hi>Berthelier</hi>'s death. The Duke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
himſelf from this Article, laying the blame on the Biſhop,
aſſuring them he did it unknown to him; and as to the payment,
he denied that he was obliged to it, ſeeing the War had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
referring them to the <hi>Genevoiſes,</hi> and demanding on his ſide
reparation for the Damages done in his Country of <hi>Vaud.</hi> This
ſet the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> in an uproar, and the Princes took the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of their Diſſentions to ruine the <hi>Eidgnots</hi> party, and bring
their own in credit. They required the Council to be aſſembled,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50836:40"/>
and cauſed <hi>Euſtache Chappuis</hi> the Biſhops Chancellor, who was
afterwards ſent Deputy into <hi>England,</hi> to ſhew the people that the
Election of <hi>Syndicks</hi> for that year had not been duly made, by the
violence of ſome, who preferred their own private intereſt before
the publick, and who had brought into the general Council perſons
excluded by the Statutes and ancient Cuſtoms, it belonging to none
to ſit there but thoſe who were of principal Families: that they did
this to have perſons of their own Faction, which tended to nothing
but to foment Rebellion: that the people for this effect had made an
Alliance with <hi>Fribourg,</hi> which had put the Biſhop their Prince upon
calling in the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> his Couſin to his aſſiſtance, who had
ſpared neither his eſtate nor his perſon to hinder ſuch a bad effect,
which would not only fall on his Countries, but likewiſe the City
it ſelf, as hath been found already by experience; ſeeing the <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgers</hi>
demanded yet great ſumms of mony, which could not be
raiſed without impoverſhing the City. The Duke endeavoured to
hinder them from paying the mony, and withal ſhewed them there
could be no good correſpondence between him and them, whilſt
they were governed by the Authors of this Alliance; and concluded,
deſiring the people to declare the ſaid <hi>Syndicks</hi> not duly elected, and
to put others leſs ſuſpected in their places.</p>
               <p>The people deſirous of Peace,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Syndicks</hi> put by their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> and that the mony ſhould be paid,
eaſily embraced this propoſal. The <hi>Syndicks</hi> were diſcharged of their
Office, after a declaration made to ſhew this, diſmiſſion proceeded
from no other cauſe but only for want of a due Election, which done
they laid down their ſtaves, and others were choſen in their places;
they ſubſtituted likewiſe ſome Councellors, who were beſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Princes;<note place="margin">Preter Verſonex, Peter Monthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Peter de Fernex <hi>junior,</hi> Will. Daguet.</note> eſpecially them who were for breaking off with
<hi>Fribourg:</hi> They cauſed the general Council to retract that Alliance,
and deputed <hi>Richardet,</hi> and <hi>Goulaz,</hi> as from the <hi>Syndicks,</hi> to meet the
<hi>Cantons</hi> aſſembled at <hi>Zurich</hi> with this inſtruction: Firſt, that they
ſhould excuſe the Duke touching the execution of <hi>Berthelier,</hi> and
acquaint them it was done againſt his knowledge, the Biſhop ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
puniſhed him according to his deſerts, as a Seditious perſon,
and as one guilty of the crime of High-Treaſon, the term likewiſe of
his Safe-conduct being expired. Secondly, concerning the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be made to them of <hi>Fribourg;</hi> they ſhould require it of them
who called them, who were ſince put out of their Office, as Authors
of theſe diſturbances. Thirdly, that they ſhould be urgent with
the <hi>Fribourgers</hi> to renounce the Burgerſhip contracted with <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Aſſembly being ſat, the Deputies from <hi>Fribourg</hi> made their
complaints, and were anſwered by them of <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the inſtructions given them.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fribourgers</hi> demand ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for <hi>Bertheliers</hi> death.</note> The <hi>Fribourgers</hi> replied,
that whoſoever had put <hi>Berthelier</hi> to death had done unjuſtly, ſeeing
he had been cleared by a definitive ſentence of the <hi>Syndicks,</hi> who were
his lawful judges, and he who had pronounced ſentence againſt him
being but a pitiful Tooth-drawer; and that the Princes had broken
their promiſe, which they made them before they left <hi>Morges,</hi> that
they would introduce no innovations till this difference was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated;
that they had reaſon to deſire a re-imburſement of their
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50836:41"/>
charges, they having taken up Arms on juſt grounds, it being to
help their fellow Citizens, received into their alliance according to
Law, the Duke nor Biſhop having no power to hinder them. They
likewiſe maintained that the former Deputies were perſons of worth,
neither would they acknowledge theſe latter, whom the people ſay
they have choſen by conſtraint. There were ſome replies made by both
parties, but the <hi>Cantons</hi> decreed it after the ſame manner and form as
at <hi>Morges,</hi> to which they were forced to yield, and agree with <hi>Savoy.</hi>
The Duke ever ſince he had married <hi>Beatrix</hi> the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
kept his Court at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and deſirous to leave a man of Authority
for his Lieutenant, he diſplaced <hi>Conſilii,</hi> and put the Sieur <hi>Salaigne</hi>
in his room, who was of the family of the <hi>Beauforts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Year following,<note place="margin">1520.</note> before the Election of the <hi>Syndicks,</hi> on the
twelfth day the Chanons were accuſtomed with other Eccleſiaſticks
to chuſe one of the Chapter King by a bean with great expence: now
it hapned to fall to <hi>Marcoſſay</hi>'s ſhare who was Governour of <hi>Pillounay,</hi>
and being of the Country of <hi>Focigny,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marcoſſay</hi>'s lot to be King.</note> he had brought along with
him as King ſeveral of his Countrymen for his Guard; at which the
Townſmen who bore them ill will were diſpleaſed, and ſpecially one
<hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Confignon,</hi> Sieur of <hi>Marglie,</hi> who having been heretofore
wounded by one of <hi>Bonne</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Goudard,</hi> reſolved then
to be revenged; and being accompanied with about a dozen reſolute
fellows, ſlid through the preſs, and ſingled out his man, who bore the
Standard, ran him through the back for want of armour, and having
left him dead on the place, made his eſcape out of the Town through
the Halbards. The Duke and Biſhop laid this Murther to the Charge
of the <hi>Eidgnots</hi> though guiltleſs, but they who had done it returned
two years after into the City, having obtained their pardon through
<hi>Confignon</hi>'s means.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> lived not long after theſe troubles,<note place="margin">1522.</note> he
died in the Abby of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> before he could arrive to S. <hi>Peters</hi>
years,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> dies of the Pox.</note> that is to ſay, before he had finiſhed the twenty fifth year of his
Office according to <hi>Pecolat</hi>'s prediction; it was thought he was poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned,
ſearch having been made accordingly: but a ſcandalous
Chronicle relates he died of the Venereal diſtemper, which brought
him into the Gout, which was accompanied moreover with filthy
Ulcers, that left him nothing but skin and bones. It is reported like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
that after his deceaſe, his body was found to weigh not above
twenty eight pound: before his death he reſigned his Benefices to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of <hi>Baume,</hi> who was of the family of the Earls of <hi>Montevel</hi> in <hi>Breſſe;</hi>
Regent of the Abby of <hi>Sure,</hi> and St. <hi>Claude,</hi> who declared his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor
died with great remorſe, eſpecially for the diſturbances he
had occaſioned in <hi>Geneva,</hi> which he intended to bring wholly under
the Dukes ſubjection.</p>
               <p>Soon after him died <hi>Conſilii,</hi> who a while before had been diſcharged
of his Office of <hi>Vidame.</hi> His death was as tragical as his life infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
his houſe was the rendezvous of all debauched perſons, his wife
ſerving as a Bawd, by which trade ſhe got wherewithall to keep
houſe. <hi>De Sardet</hi> one of the two hundred Gentlemen belonging to the
Court of <hi>France,</hi> and of the Family of the <hi>Vitry</hi>'s, frequented there
with a hundred others more: he lodged in the houſe whilſt his mony
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50836:41"/>
laſted, but having conſumed it all in feaſting and extravagant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments,
<hi>Conſilii</hi> pretending to be jealous of him, thought by that
means to get rid of him; but the Gentleman enraged at his baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
their quarrel proceeded ſo far that <hi>Sardet</hi>'s Valet meeting one
day <hi>Conſilii</hi> in the open ſtreet, accoſted him with theſe words, '<hi>S Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Mr. Whoreſon, You have made my Maſter beat me, and therefore now I
will be revenged of you for it;</hi> which ſaid, he ſtruck him into the belly
with his knife,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conſilii</hi> ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> and fled out of the City. <hi>Conſilii</hi> was carried home,
and died immediately upon it. The good Gentlewoman his Wife
counterfeited great ſorrow, and pretended to be very much incenſed
for awhile againſt <hi>Sardet,</hi> but he made his excuſes to her, and the
better to make his peace with her they were married together. <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det</hi>
died ſome time after, and ſhe becoming a widow the ſecond time,
made uſe of that little beauty ſhe had left her, to draw young men
to her houſe, till Old Age finiſhing his ſpoils on her, had wiped out
all her charms, and ſhe ended the reſt of her daies in an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital.</p>
               <p>On the twelfth of <hi>April</hi> in the year following <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Baume,</hi>

                     <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Baume</hi> choſen Biſhop.</note> made his entrance, and took the Oath given
him by the <hi>Syndicks</hi> on the Bridge of <hi>Arve;</hi> the people made
great preparations for his reception, but he would have them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
for the Dutcheſs who was ſhortly to come there, as indeed
ſhe did awhile after with the Duke,<note place="margin">Preparations made for the entertainment of the Dutcheſs</note> and were magnificently recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
The Youth of the City were ſumptuouſly apparelled in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask
Silk, and in Velvet, and Cloth of Silver, armed each of them
with a Half-Pike. But the comelieſt ſight was a Company of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons,</hi>
who were Women richly attired; their Petticoats truſſed up
to their knees, carrying a Dart in their right hands; and in their left
a Buckler or Shield gilded with ſilver after the manner of the ancient
ſhe-Warriers. They were led by a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dame, the wife of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>
of S. <hi>Michael</hi> Sieur of <hi>Avoully,</hi> who was to complement the
Dutcheſs in her own Language. They bore in their Colours the
Effigies of a large handſom Woman the Daughter of an <hi>Apothecary</hi>
called great <hi>James,</hi> who could flouriſh a Colours with the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
Enſign.</p>
               <p>The Dutcheſs had deſired for her welcome to have her lodgings
in the Townhouſe, but it was denied her. A rich Merchant offered
her his own houſe, which was more ſtately and convenient than it, but
ſhe would not accept of it. Their entrance was after this manner:
The Dutcheſs was carried from the Bridge of <hi>Arve</hi> in a triumphant
Chariot drawn by four Horſes, which were covered with cloth of
gold, ſet with precious ſtones, which dazled the ſight of the beholders.
The Duke her Husband followed mounted on a Mule together with
the Abbot of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> and one of his Gentlemen, all three cloathed
after the ſame faſhion with gray Clokes and Caps to pull over their
necks. The Dutcheſs having paſſed over the Bridge was met by
theſe <hi>Amazons,</hi> whoſe Captain preſented her with a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Sonnet
full of Elogies, high Encomiums and offers of the Towns ſervice; but
ſhe was ſo far from thanking them, that ſhe would not ſo much as
caſt her eyes towards them. Afterwards ſhe was met by the young
men, who receiv'd as little reſpect from her as the former; at which the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50836:42"/>
Citizens were diſpleaſed; ſaying they paid her not theſe reſpects
out of any ſenſe of duty, but only to teſtify their affection to her as
friends. Whereas on the contrary the Dutcheſs who was a <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gais</hi>
ſhewed ſhe eſteemed them not only as Subjects, but as Slaves,
after the <hi>Portugais</hi> faſhion. There were ſome who were of opinion
that they ſhould do well to pull down the Theatres and Scaffolds
erected for their divertiſement; ſeeing ſhe ſeemed to take no delight
in what they did for her; ſaying further, <hi>It were better to employ the
mony ſpent on theſe entertainments in fortifying the Town, and keeping
them out, than in drawing of them in: After which ſort they wounded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with their own weapons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet they continued to feaſt them, being attended by the whole
City with all the ſigns of mirth and jollity. The Dutcheſſes reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs
was excuſed by ſome, ſaying, <hi>che eran los coſtumbres de Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi>
that it was the <hi>Portugal</hi> faſhion. Yet ſhe did make the Ladies
a ſumptuous Feaſt, attended with Balls and Maſquerades and Farces,
ſo that ſince <hi>Philberts</hi> time the City had ſeen no ſuch divertiſements.
There was likewiſe a Turney kept, in which the Townſmen ſhewed
themſelves as expert as the Courtiers: in ſhort this year was ſpent
in deviſing how to make the Duke and Dutcheſs welcome, furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both them and their train with proviſion and houſhold ſtuff, as
well for delight as neceſſity. It may be truly affirmed, that they
were better obeyed and ſerved at <hi>Geneva</hi> on courteſie, than they
would have been at <hi>Chambery</hi> by obligation.</p>
               <p>The year following,<note place="margin">1524.</note> the Dutcheſs was delivered of a Son who was
baptized at <hi>Geneva.</hi> He was named <hi>Charles,</hi> and died awhile after
in <hi>Spain,</hi> before his father could make him as he had vainly promiſed
Prince of <hi>Geneva;</hi> the Dutcheſs paſſionately deſiring ſhe might enjoy
with this ſon the Sovereignty of that City: for ſhe uſed to ſay in her
own Language, <hi>che era muouch buona poſada,</hi> that it was a very good
place to make an Inn of.</p>
               <p>About this time the Emperor and King of <hi>France</hi> were at variance,<note place="margin">Emperor and King of <hi>France</hi> at variance.</note>
and would each of them fain draw the Duke over to their ſide but
he kept himſelf Neuter, being the Emperors Brother-in-law and Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,
and the King of <hi>France</hi> his Uncle. The differences between <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
and the Pope began to break out about this time. The Duke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
uſe of this juncture of affairs to fiſh, as we ſay, in troubled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and wholly to ſubdue <hi>Geneva</hi> to himſelf. The Walls and Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
were no ways amended; and the Biſhop although well affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to the liberties of the Town, and the priviledges of the Church,
yet might eaſily be prevailed on, being very amorouſly inclined, and
addicted to thoſe pleaſures which ſoften the ſevereſt minds, and ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle
the moſt commendable virtues; having moreover ſeveral conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Benefices in the Dukes dominions, of which he might be
deprived if he oppoſed the Duke. Moreover the Youth of the City
were ſo effeminated by Courtly delights, that they were more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of a Licence for their Debaucheries than paſſionate for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the City.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vidame Salaigne</hi> being deceaſed, the Duke had put <hi>Verneau</hi>
in his ſtead, who was cauſed according to ancient Cuſtom to ſwear
to be true to the Biſhop; but the Duke pretended, it was to him or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50836:42"/>
his he ought to do it; the Biſhop made ſome ſmall oppoſition, and
appeaſed the Duke the beſt he could. The Duke to pluck this thorn
out of his foot, found out a means to ſend the Biſhop into <hi>Piedmont</hi>
in the Emperors ſervice, which he dared not refuſe as belonging to
the Emperor. He left his brother S. <hi>Sorlin</hi> at <hi>Geneva</hi> to govern in
his abſence, who being likewiſe addicted to his pleaſures, left the
management of all affairs to the Epiſcopal Council. It was conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one day whether the <hi>Vidame</hi> his appeal ſhould be carried to the
Dukes Council or not; the greateſt part of the Councellors were his
Subjects born, and leaned to the affirmative; <hi>Levrery</hi> alone, Judge of
exceſſes, ſon of the other <hi>Levrery</hi> whom we have aforementioned,
maintained, the Duke had no Authority in <hi>Geneva,</hi> and that the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
ſhould be brought before the Biſhop: of which the Duke ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
notice by his Favourites, he ſent for the Epiſcopal Council, who
all went except <hi>Levrery.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Levrery</hi> ſent for by the Duke.</note> He made ſeveral complaints, and uſed ſome
threats toward them, but they laid all the blame on <hi>Levrery,</hi> whom
he commanded to bring along with them, promiſing he ſhould have
no ill uſage; who coming into his preſence, the Duke ſpake thus
very huffingly, <hi>There are ſome among you who ſay, I am not Lord of</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,
and no body anſwering, he added, <hi>it is one</hi> Levrery, <hi>is it not?
will not he be here? Levrery</hi> preſenting himſelf, <hi>it was I my Lord,</hi> ſaid
he, <hi>but when I ſaid this, it was in Council, for which I am not to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned.
Get you gone,</hi> ſaid the Duke, <hi>and make it appear by good
ſufficient proofs in three days time, otherwiſe look to your ſelf. Lev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rery</hi>
departed the more troubled, by how much the more he ſaw
it difficult to produce the City Writings, ſeeing they were in the
hands of thoſe who were affectioned to the Duke; ſo that his friends
could not better adviſe him than to get out of the way: but he would
not take their advice, chuſing rather, as he ſaid, to die in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
S. <hi>Peters</hi> Authority, and the Cities priviledges, as <hi>Berthelier</hi> had
done before him. He remained in the City beyond the time prefixed
by the Duke, coming and going as before, which the more enraged
his Highneſs, who believed he did it out of contempt: he cauſed him
then to be laid hold on by his Bayliff and ſome Gentlemen as he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
out of S. <hi>Peters</hi> Gate: they brought him to the Duke, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of his Palace, was going to our Lady of <hi>Grace</hi>'s Church to
hear Maſs, to the end he might be near the Bridge of <hi>Arve,</hi> and ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
retire into his own Countrys in caſe the people ſhould attempt his
reſcue; but there was no danger of that, for they were afraid of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the matter rather worſe than better, ſhould they have appeared
in his behalf. S. <hi>Sorlin</hi> had withdrawn himſelf to <hi>Remilly,</hi> that he
might avoid the obligation of defending <hi>Levrery.</hi> The Priſoner clothed
as he was in a Velvet Jacket, was ſet upon a ſorry horſe, as if he were
ſome raſcally fellow, with his hands tied behind him, and his legs
faſtned under the horſes belly, and was led in this equipage to <hi>Bonne,</hi>
accompanied with a crew, who ceaſed not all the way to injure him;
but eſpecially one <hi>Francis Noel,</hi> (who to ennoble himſelf would be
called Mr. <hi>de Bellegard,</hi> by the name of a certain Farm.) This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
although formerly he had been his great companion, yet was
more ſevere upon him than any of the reſt; but his baſeneſs was well
requited, having broken his leg before he came to <hi>Bonne,</hi> where
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50836:43"/>
they delivered <hi>Levrery</hi> to the Bayliff, after they had ſearched
him.</p>
               <p>The next Morning the Ladies who had honoured the Dutcheſs
at her entrance into <hi>Geneva,</hi> came to intreat her to pacify the
Dukes anger againſt poor <hi>Levrery:</hi> but in vain; for he had already
ſent the Provoſt of his Houſhold, the Confeſſor and Executioner
to <hi>Bonne.</hi> Where they were no ſooner arrived, but the Provoſt
according to his Inſtructions cauſed him to be put on the Rack,
and required him to confeſs his Accomplices. He anſwered, he
had none; at which the Provoſt reſting ſatisfied, without further
diſcourſe, Sentenced him to be beheaded; which was executed the
ſame Night by Torch-light,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Levrery</hi> put to death.</note> after he had confeſſed himſelf to his
Ghoſtly Father, and that he had written on the Priſon wall the
ſame words as <hi>Berthelier</hi> had done before him. It is ſaid when the
Executioner led him to the place of Execution in the Caſtle, he
ſpake aloud as he went theſe words: <hi>God give me grace to die, for
S.</hi> Peter'<hi>s Authority, and my Countries Liberty.</hi> This buſineſs aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
the Citizens, who complained of their Paſtors forſaking
them: and in this general conſternation the Duke might eaſily
have made himſelf Maſter of the City: but by good hap, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
to <hi>Thonon,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Piedmont,</hi> where <hi>Francis</hi> the
Firſt being taken before <hi>Pavie,</hi> he left his ſide and came over to
the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth.</p>
               <p>In this Year <hi>Claudius Richardet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1525.</note> one of the <hi>Syndicks</hi> of the <hi>Eid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnots</hi>
Party, declared in Council, That the City had been at great
charge in entertaining the Duke, the Revenues thereof being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
they knew not after what manner, and that it was fitting
<hi>Boulet</hi> the Treaſurer ſhould be called to an account for it. Who
being one of the Faction of the <hi>Mammeluſſes,</hi> and enraged at the
matter,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Claudius Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardet</hi> breaks his Staff on the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers Head.</note> cried out in a paſſion, <hi>What muſt we ſtill be governed by theſe</hi>
Eidgnots? The <hi>Syndick</hi> taking now his turn to be angry, broke his
Syndical Staff on the others Head. <hi>Boulet</hi> thereupon makes his
complaint to the Dukes Council at <hi>Chambery,</hi> who granted him a
Writ to cite them of <hi>Geneva</hi> to make their appearance. He ſet it
up at the Bridge of <hi>Arve.</hi> The <hi>Syndicks</hi> regarded it not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaying, That
neither the Duke nor his Council had any authority over them.
But they were condemned for their contempt; and in purſuit of
this, their Eſtates which lay in <hi>Savoy</hi> were confiſcated. The <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevoiſes</hi>
ſent their Deputies to the Duke and Biſhop, deſiring them
to maintain, according to their Oaths, the Liberties of the City.
But the Duke made them no ſatisfaction. The Biſhop pretended
to be troubled at it; although it may be judged he was very well
pleaſed, as we may believe by what follows: For having gotten
300 Crowns of the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> to carry their Appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> he
ſtirred not in the buſineſs. Some private Perſons deſigning to do it
ſecretly, the Duke hindred them, and made them fly into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And not content with this, he ſent Judge <hi>Bartalais</hi> and the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Hugues</hi> of <hi>Rogemont</hi> to <hi>Geneva,</hi> to the end the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi>
ſhould renounce this Appeal, and remit the Recogniſance of crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Caſes to himſelf. Which Article was delivered to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50836:43"/>
Council, and the chief <hi>Syndick Nergaz</hi> paſſed it, ſaying, That
matter brought no great advantage to the City: <hi>Bonier</hi> another
of the <hi>Syndicks</hi> ſtrongly oppoſed it, ſaying, He would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to it, and called them Traitors who would. But he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not long in this mind, for a while after he took part with the
Duke.</p>
               <p>Upon this refuſal the <hi>Vidame,</hi> by the Dukes order, deſigned to
weaken the <hi>Eidgnots</hi> Faction in apprehending ſome of the chief of
them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eidgnots</hi> Faction en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be weakned.</note> who were <hi>Beſançon Hugues, Peter</hi> and <hi>Claudius Baud, Amy
Gerard</hi> the Treaſurer, <hi>Francis Roſſet</hi> Inn-holder at the <hi>Blacks-head,
John Lulin</hi> Inn-keeper at the <hi>Bear, Peter</hi> of <hi>Toy,</hi> aliàs <hi>Poulain,</hi> and
one <hi>Chabot.</hi> Which two laſt intending to ſave themſelves by fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Fribourg,</hi> fell at <hi>Verſoy</hi> into an Ambuſcade laid by their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
<hi>Poulain</hi> being well mounted made his eſcape, but <hi>Chabot</hi> was
carried to <hi>Gex.</hi> Notice was given to the reſt to ſtand upon their
Guard. <hi>Williet</hi> the Bayliff of <hi>Gex</hi> intending to apprehend <hi>Hugues,</hi>
who was his Goſſip, came and lay at his Houſe at <hi>Chatelaine;</hi> but
he being informed of his deſign, was too cunning for him: for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received him the Night before with the greateſt outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of joy, he made his eſcape the next Night with ſome
Friends, and took the Bayliffs Horſe along with him. They were
purſued by the Provoſt and his Men, and by his Highneſs's Guards,
but they could not overtake them, having gotten already to <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
where they made their complaints of the Dukes violences,
beſeeching the Lords either to continue the Alliance, or to make
another. They had fair promiſes made them; after which they
went and Addreſſed themſelves to the States of <hi>Zurich,</hi> who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the troubles which began at that time about Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
gave ear to them, and diſpatched two Deputies to the Duke
at <hi>Anecy.</hi> The Duke at their ſuit granted a Releaſe to the Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and a Safe conduct to the <hi>Eidgnots,</hi> who had withdrawn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into <hi>Switzerland.</hi> Yet they would not accept of it, ſeeing
it contained ſome dangerous points: wherefore they were more ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
to make an Alliance with the confederate <hi>Cantons;</hi> which
was promiſed ſhould be effected by them of <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Fribourg,</hi>
when they ſhould have leaſure to conſider more narrowly of the
Articles of that Treaty.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Duke being arrived at <hi>Geneva,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Duke deſires to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign over the City of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva.</hi>

for that purpoſe, where he aſſiſted in Perſon, ſitting in his
Chair, his Chancellor behind him, and his Guards round about
him, for fear of any Popular Tumult; which Council hath been
ſince called, <hi>The Council of Halbards.</hi> The Chancellor, <hi>Gabriel de
Lande,</hi> demanded of the People, as from the Duke, that in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the pains and trouble his Predeceſſors had underwent
to maintain their State, they ſhould therefore acknowledge him
Soveraign Protector of the City, and that they ſhould diſown the
Fugitives and Burgerſhip, which they were contracting with the
<hi>Switzers.</hi> Which Propoſals amazed the People, and yet they gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him nothing; he therefore ſeeing his endeavours fruitleſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Piedmont.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> Yet he came there again a while after, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50836:44"/>
began to ſpeak more gently to the <hi>Syndicks,</hi> aſſuring them he had
expreſly commanded that the Eſtates belonging to the City ſhould
be reſtored; adding moreover, that he would not in the leaſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
derogate from the Liberties and Priviledges thereof; for which
they thanked him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vidame</hi> and Judge <hi>Barralis</hi> preſented themſelves before the
Council,<note place="margin">Octob.</note> ſhewing them as Friends to the City, who deſired nothing
more than its Repoſe and Eſtabliſhment, That ſeeing the Duke was
Vicar of the Empire, and Soveraign in all his Country, he might
alſo be acknowledged Soveraign in <hi>Geneva,</hi> without any prejudice
to the Biſhop or City; by which means he would watch over it
for its preſervation: and that moreover it would be a difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to hinder him, if he were minded, to take by force this Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
upon him: that they might eaſily perceive the Biſhop
would not help them in their neceſſities: that the Duke was a
mild and generous Prince, who would defend and maintain them
againſt any who ſhould oppoſe them. Upon which it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
They would deliberate on the matter, and confer with the
Epiſcopal and General Council, and with <hi>M.</hi> of <hi>Geneva.</hi> In the
mean time the <hi>Vidame</hi> and <hi>Barralis</hi> plied the Councellors ſo faſt
with good words, or threats, that the greateſt part of them told
the <hi>Syndicks, If ye will acknowledge him, we will likewiſe.</hi> But they
held firm, and troubled themſelves no more about it.</p>
               <p>Twelve days after came the Deputies from <hi>Fribourg</hi> and <hi>Soleurre,</hi>
who ſhewed the Council, That if they ſhould be any more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
about their Priviledges,<note place="margin">Council divided.</note> their Superiors would take them into
their Protection. The Council were very much divided, and
thoſe who took part with the Duke oftentimes carried it from the
reſt, as they did then; for the anſwer given the Deputies was
this, That they who had made their complaints to them, did it
without the conſent of the Town, and ſo they were diſmiſſed with
this anſwer. They wrote to the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Berne</hi> at the ſame time;
as alſo to <hi>Fribourg, Soleurre</hi> and <hi>Lucerne,</hi> that they ſhould not give
heed to all complaints made them, without the conſent of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The <hi>Fribourgers</hi> wrote back again, deſiring to ſee the Cities
Charter; which was refuſed them, ſaying, They had no cauſe to
complain againſt the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 10th of <hi>December</hi> the Duke cauſed another Council to

proteſting againſt the injury done them in their diſowning of them,
ſaying, They deſired no anſwer, but only Letters teſtimonial from

to come and ſet the Affairs of the City in order, which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

               <p>The Biſhop upon notice of this news returned,<note place="margin">1526.</note> and was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the whole City with great joy.<note place="margin">Feb. 1.</note> Two days after he ſent for

given him an account of all the Traverſes they had met with,<note place="margin">The Biſhop returns to <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </note>
he ſaid unto them, <hi>Neither have I been exempt from the like troubles,
for the Duke told me once in his Brothers preſence, That he intended to
have the Soveraignty of</hi> Geneva: <hi>but reſolving with my ſelf to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Rights and Priviledges of my Church, even to death, I made
him this anſwer, That being</hi> Peter <hi>of</hi> Baume, <hi>I was his humble Servant
and Subject; but as being Biſhop of</hi> Geneva, <hi>I was not his Subject, and
that he had no Right to the City.</hi> He moreover ſhewed them it
would be very neceſſary the deliberations in Council ſhould be
carried on more privately, and that in buſineſs of conſequence
they ſhould make uſe of little Balls, as they do at <hi>Venice.</hi>

               <p>Eight days after new <hi>Syndicks</hi> were choſen.<note place="margin">Feb. 8.</note> The <hi>Fribourgers</hi> and

days after the General Council was aſſembled, at the ringing of
the great Bell,<note place="margin">Feb. 25.</note> where there were not above Five or Six Perſons
who would not conſent to this Alliance: The Biſhop being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
proteſted againſt every thing which might prejudice his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

               <p>The Chapter of the Cathedral were ſtartled at the matter,<note place="margin">Feb. 27.</note> the
Chanons and Clergy deſiring to know of the <hi>Syndicks,</hi> whether
they might repute themſelves ſafe in the City? It was anſwered,
They had no cauſe to fear, for if the Chanon of <hi>Lutry</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
any ill uſage, it was becauſe he refuſed to deliver the
Keys of the Church, when they would have aſſembled the laſt
Council.</p>
               <p>Eight Deputies parted from <hi>Geneva</hi> to ſwear to the Agreement,
and Eight others from <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Fribourg</hi> arrived to do the ſame

               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:50836:45"/>
The next Morning the Oath was taken in preſence of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council,<note place="margin">1526.</note> the People crying out,<note place="margin">March 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Thus would we have it, thus
would we have it; in a good hour were they born, who have procured
us ſo great good.</hi> At Night the Deputies were entertained and
treated with Plays and Bonfires at <hi>Molard,</hi> in token of joy; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which they returned, carrying with them the Copy of the
Oath ſealed.</p>
               <p>Not long after the City had advice, by an Expreſs from <hi>Berne,</hi>
that Monſieur <hi>de Lulin</hi> had addreſſed himſelf to the Duke in a
Council held at <hi>Lucerne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 14.</note> to cauſe the Burgerſhip to be revoked;
and the ſame did <hi>Nergaz,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Servant,</hi> and Forty other <hi>Mammeluſſes.</hi>
The buſineſs was referred to be tranſacted at <hi>Berne,</hi> in a Council
there, where appeared the Deputies of <hi>Geneva, Hugues,</hi> and <hi>du
Molard.</hi> The concluſion was, That the three Cities would by no
means revoke their Alliance,<note place="margin">April 7.</note> and that if the Duke would not
reſt ſatisfied, he ſhould have the Letters of the Alliance, which
he had made with <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Fribourg,</hi> returned him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eidgnots,</hi> who were at that time the moſt powerful, ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
this appearance of the <hi>Mammeluſſes,</hi> who were forced to
leave the Town by an emotion of the People. They withdrew to
the Dukes Dominions.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mammeluſſes</hi>'s Conſpiracy.</note> A while after they ſent to know whether
they might return? Anſwer was made them, <hi>They might, if they
could prove themſelves honeſt Men.</hi> But they dared not venture. At
length, upon inquiry, it was found, That they, together with the
<hi>Vidame,</hi> had conſpired to ſeize on the chief <hi>Eidgnots,</hi> and to cut off
their Heads. <hi>Peter Gruet,</hi> the Biſhops Vicar, was ſuſpected to be
of the Dukes Party: whereupon he was depoſed, and the Abbot
of <hi>Beaumont</hi> put in his place. The 42 <hi>Mammeluſſes</hi> were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
by ſound of Trumpet to make their appearance; but not
one of them obeying this order, they were condemned for their
contumacy, and their Eſtates forfeited; which produced a long Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
before the Confederates. The <hi>Vidame,</hi> upon information given
him that he was accuſed of a Conſpiracy, left the City, ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Bayliff <hi>Dulcis</hi> in his room. Neither did he remain long
in power; for the People would ſuffer no more pleadings in the
Stewards Court, but would have all matters decided by the Four <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicks,</hi>
ſo that he retired into the Country of <hi>Focigny.</hi> The Jaylor
of the Iſle did the ſame, leaving a Perſon to look after the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners;
One of whom, being convicted of Felony, was by the
<hi>Syndicks</hi> condemned to die. The <hi>Vidame</hi>'s abſence was well known:
but to take away all occaſion from the Duke to complain, he was
ſought for in his Houſe, by a Notary and Witneſſes; where they
were told, that he had left the Town. They had the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
at the Bayliffs Houſe. Whereupon it was concluded in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
notwithſtanding, to proceed on to Execution. The common
Serjeant was ordered to ſupply the <hi>Vidame</hi>'s place, which he did,
and after the ſentence was read, he led the Malefactor towards
the Caſtle gate, cauſing the Bayliff of <hi>Gaillard</hi> to be called: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to cuſtom the Duke had beſtowed this office on <hi>Servant,</hi>
as a recompence for his Services and Exile from <hi>Geneva. Servant</hi>
ſent a Man in his place to receive the Priſoner, who demanded of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50836:45"/>
the Serjeant whether he was <hi>Vidame?</hi> he anſwered no, but that he
was the City and Councils ſervant. Then the Bailiffs Deputy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<hi>I will not receive him at your hands, ſeeing you are not my Lords
Officer; for neither you nor your</hi> Syndicks <hi>have power to command me:</hi>
which having ſaid, he ſet ſpurrs to his horſe, and returned. The
Common-Serjeant gave notice of this to the <hi>Syndicks,</hi> who bad him
proceed, and gave him order for the Execution, which he obeyed,
and ever ſince that time,<note place="margin">1526.</note> the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> hath held no Office in
the City.</p>
               <p>The Dukes Arms ſtood over the Caſtle-gate in the Iſle,<note place="margin">The Dukes Arms batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down.</note> but in the
night they were battered to pieces with a hammer by an unknown
hand. The Bridge in the Iſle over againſt the great Bridge, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
found broken down. The Duke joyned this amongſt other
complaints againſt <hi>Geneva,</hi> and it was debated before the Cantons,
till the year 1530. All outrages on either ſide were forbid during
this proceſs, but there always hapned ſome diſturbances. For to
hinder the inſulting of the Dukes party by the fear of diſobliging
the <hi>Switzers,</hi> there were ſix perſons conſtantly reſiding at <hi>Berne,</hi> and
as many at <hi>Fribourg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop undertook to bring in again the exiled <hi>Mammeluſſes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">June 21.</note>
the Council agreed to receive the moſt moderate of them, paying
as a Fine Eighteen thouſand Crowns of gold; but the Duke hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
ſometimes threatning to deal with them as enemies if they did,
and otherwhiles promiſing to introduce them all in general upon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
terms.</p>
               <p>The Articles of Burgerſhip being made ready, when they were
to be ſigned, ſeveral of the Dukes party abſented themſelves, and
from that time they were ſuſpected: a little while after, there was
a Diet held at <hi>Soleurre,</hi> in which the Confederates anſwered the
Dukes Embaſſadors, that they ſhould not mention any more that
matter, ſeeing he could not prove that he had any right to <hi>Geneva</hi> and
<hi>Lauſane,</hi> who on the contrary had produced their Titles.</p>
               <p>The Duke meditating revenge,<note place="margin">1526.</note> prohibited all Merchandiſes and
proviſion to be carried out of his Dominions to <hi>Geneva;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Octob. 19.</note> but a <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald</hi>
from the two Cities of <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Fribourg,</hi> paſſed through <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi>
in his journy to <hi>Chambery,</hi> to give notice to the Duke that his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,<note place="margin">Nov. 17.</note>
would not be heard in the general Aſſembly in <hi>Switzerland</hi>
till he had taken off this prohibition, and reduced things to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſtate;<note place="margin">Decemb. 3.</note> which he did ſome days after publickly in appearance, but
he ſent notice about privately, that he would have the former Order
obſerved, and that his Subjects ſhould be ready in their Arms at the
firſt ringing of the Bell, and beat of Drum.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of this Year aroſe a difference about a Priſoner of
the <hi>Mammeluſſes</hi> faction,<note place="margin">1526.</note> whom the <hi>Syndicks</hi> condemned to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
as a Taytor to the Biſhop and City;<note place="margin">Decem. 13.</note> but his kindred obtained
their conſent to requeſt the Biſhops pardon, which ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
at the place of Execution, with this proviſo, that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in Priſon till he had paid a Fine; but the Biſhop ſtood at the
Caſtle gate,<note place="margin">1527.</note> and gave him his Pardon, and the Officers unbound
him and let him go;<note place="margin">The Gout cured.</note> at which the poor man was ſo tranſported with
joy, that although full of the Gout, he ran to the Priſon, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50836:46"/>
into it joyfuller than he went out,<note place="margin">Feb. 20.</note> having never ſince felt his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</p>
               <p>The Dyet held at <hi>Berne,</hi> on the 22. of <hi>December,</hi> 1526. had
again ratified the Burgerſhip with <hi>Geneva,</hi> and concluded to return
the Copy of the Alliance made with him, becauſe it was made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the peoples conſent. In the month of <hi>May</hi> another being held,
the two Cities of <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Fribourg</hi> ſent to the Duke who was at
<hi>Chambery,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">May 1.</note> to demand the Letters of Alliance, which he would not
grant, no more than he would make ſatisfaction for the damages done
to <hi>Geneva,</hi> and do juſtice on the Murtherers, his Subjects, who had
killed a <hi>Genevois</hi> named <hi>Gentil,</hi> and ſome other perſons: neither
would he ſuffer the fugitive <hi>Mammeluſſes</hi> to plead their cauſe at <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1527.</note>
upon Letters of Safe-conduct offered by the Biſhop.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Syndicks</hi> being informed that there were Soldiers lying in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcade
at <hi>Lancy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">July 13.</note> beyond the Bridge of <hi>Arve,</hi>

diſcovered, withdrew. It was known afterwards that it was the
Captain of the Dukes Guards, who had gathered ſome Troops to
take the Biſhop <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Baume,</hi> at our Lady of <hi>Grace</hi>'s Church,
where he went uſually to Maſs every Saturday, but by good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
he was not there that day: it is thought they deſigned to put

                  <note place="margin">Auguſt 1.</note> having firſt cancelled
the Letters Teſtimonial, which he had heretofore made againſt the
Alliance of the Town with the Confederates.</p>
               <p>Fifteen days after he ſent the <hi>Syndicks</hi> a Copy of a Letter,<note place="margin">Aug. 18.</note> dated
the firſt of <hi>April,</hi> which the Emperor had written to the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> which fell into his hands in paſſing through S. <hi>Claude;</hi> the
Contents of which were, that his Imperial Majeſty having underſtood
that they of <hi>Geneva</hi> had made an Alliance with the <hi>Cantons</hi> for to
maintain themſelves againſt the Dukes oppreſſions,<note place="margin">The Emperor injoyns the Duke to deſiſt from his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors after Soveraignty over <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </note> and his Officers,
who had violated the Biſhop and Cities priviledges; it enjoyned the
ſaid Duke to forbear his pretenſions for the time to come of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty,
otherwiſe he would make it appear that this diſpleaſed him,
for he would maintain whatſoever his predeceſſors had eſtabliſhed in
this Imperial City.</p>
               <p>The two Cantons of <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Fribourg,</hi> wrote likewiſe to
the Duke not to moleſt their Allies of <hi>Geneva.</hi> The <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meluſſes</hi>
finding they could not prevail with the Cantons, to enter
again the City, removed their ſuit to <hi>Vienna;</hi> but the general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
being met, there was a Copy of the Imperial Letter read, by
which they were in hopes to find that <hi>Geneva</hi> was not ſubject to <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi>
and from thence forward, it was concluded that no perſon for
the time to come ſhould proſecute any cauſe in that Court. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<hi>Baume</hi> deſirous to ſhew his affection to the City, and the care
he took for its intereſt, made himſelf a Citizen thereof, as appears
by an Act dated the fifteenth of <hi>July,</hi> 1527. at which the Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enraged, ſeized on the Abbies of <hi>Sure</hi> and <hi>Pignerol</hi> which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him, which he offered to him again for the <hi>Vidomat</hi> or Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50836:46"/>
The Biſhop likewiſe at the ſame time remitted the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
of civil Cauſes to the <hi>Syndicks,</hi> to leſſen the charge which
perſons were at in his Court.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Mammeluſſes</hi> faction,<note place="margin">The fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Spoon.</note> there aroſe another out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which did much hurt to the Citizens, which was the Confraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Gentlemen of <hi>La Cuillier,</hi> or the Spoon, with whom were joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſome diſaffected Chanons of the Dukes party. This Fraternity
was inſtituted in the Caſtle of <hi>Vaud,</hi> where ſome Gentlemen being
at Table, eating amongſt other things Broth with Wicker Spoons;
they bragged that they would make them of <hi>Geneva</hi> do the ſame.
They hanged each of them their Spoons about their necks for a note
of diſtinction, and thoſe <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Pontverre, Sieur</hi> of <hi>Terny,</hi> a man
couragious and skilful in warlike affairs, for their Captain; they had
from that time ſeveral meetings to conſult on their deſign, at which
the Duke was not at all pleaſed; fearing it would end in his preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.
They did great hurt to <hi>Geneva,</hi> waſting the Country there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
and miſuſing them whoſe buſineſs led them to the City.
Complaints of this were made to the Cities, who inſtead of Soldiers
ſent Embaſſadors, which theſe Gentlemen valued not. They excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
themſelves on account of the troubles which the change of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
had produced in <hi>Switzerland;</hi> yet they ſent at length two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
conſiſting of about 800. men. Theſe two Companies being
arrived, they were deſired to ſet upon the Enemy, but the Captains
refuſed to do it; ſaying, that they were Allies of the Duke as well
as <hi>Geneva,</hi> and that they were only ſent to guard the City, ſo that they
were forced to have patience, and to provide them good quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>The Deputies in the mean time went to the Dukes party, and
concluded ſuch a kind of Peace, that made theſe two Factions in
ſome ſort agree. Six weeks after they were called back again,
by reaſon the Enemy continued his inſultings: but the Soldiers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of fighting him, fell upon the Capons and Partridges. The
Dukes party making a jeſt of it, ſaid, <hi>That theſe Soldier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s</hi> had made
the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> real <hi>Huguenots,</hi> ſeeing they eat the Birds and left the
Feathers to the <hi>Genevoiſes,</hi> who wore them in their Hats for a token
of their Alliance; for we have already mentioned that <hi>Eidgnots</hi> or
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> as it was indifferently pronounced, ſignified <hi>Allies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeemed the two Cities were very apprehenſive leſt they ſhould
break off with the Duke; for from the year 1527. to 1530. there
was nothing enterprized againſt theſe Gentlemen of the <hi>Spoon,</hi> but
onely one ſally made on the ſide of <hi>Gaillard,</hi> which was effected by
the contrivance of <hi>Amy Girard</hi> the <hi>Syndick,</hi> who ſent word to him
who watched in the Bell-Tower, that the Enemy was ſeen at the
Gate <hi>de Rive,</hi> although there was then a Truce made, which put the
City into an alarm. Three Companies of Foot iſſued out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in very bad order,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Geneva</hi> alarm'd.</note> there being but two Horſemen in the whole
Army, which were the Prior of S. <hi>Victor</hi> and a Prieſt belonging to
him. <hi>Baſtien</hi> of <hi>Dieſpach</hi> Deputy of <hi>Berne,</hi> followed them with full
ſpeed on Horſeback, who ſeeing the night approaching, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of <hi>Victor</hi> cauſed the Townſmen to march back: awhile after the
Captain of the Company of <hi>Fribourg,</hi> who was at <hi>Cartigny,</hi> was ordered
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50836:47"/>
to quit the Village and Caſtle. No ſooner had they left it, but <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi>
of <hi>Grenant,</hi> Captain of the Dukes Guard took poſſeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mammeluſſes</hi> who were fled not returning after ſo many ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,<note place="margin">1528.</note>
had at length ſentence of death pronounced againſt them by
the <hi>Syndicks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Feb. 21.</note> to the number of forty four of them, and their eſtates
for feited.</p>
               <p>On Sunday the fifth of <hi>April,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Meteor ſeen at <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </note> was ſeen at Sun-ſetting, a Meteor
ſeldom appearing, and which the people making no diſtinction call a
Comet; it was a flying torch in the form of a fire-brand, which went
from the Eaſt to the Weſt, and left behind it whereſoever it paſſed,
ſparks as it were of fire; a quarter of an hour after it had diſappeared,
there was heard a noiſe like the report of a great piece of Ordnance,
which coming from between the Weſt and the Eaſt ended it ſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the North; and for at leaſt an hours ſpace afterward there was
heard ſuch a kind of noiſe as comes out of a fiery furnace, at which
the very beaſts being affrighted, wandered bellowing from one ſide
to the other.</p>
               <p>It was in this Year that the <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> after ſeveral diſputes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,<note place="margin">1528.</note>

the ſame in <hi>Germany.</hi> The <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> would have certain Villages
which the <hi>Fribourgers</hi> pretended belonged to them, to receive the
ſame Doctrine, which raiſed a diſturbance betwixt theſe two Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
who both demanded aſſiſtance from <hi>Geneva.</hi> The <hi>Genevoiſes</hi>

theſe two Cities were reconciled, and the Forces ſent home

               <p>Some <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks of <hi>Berne</hi> were forced to flie to <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>và,</hi>

three months in S. <hi>Victor.</hi> The Gentlemen of the <hi>Spoon</hi> deſirous
to try whether they could draw <hi>Bonnivard</hi> out thence, came one

From that time the <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> frequented more <hi>Geneva</hi> than the

and <hi>Saturdays;</hi> ſo that they perſwaded ſeveral to diſobey

would forſake their Alliance.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Victor</hi> his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the <hi>Genevoiſes.</hi>
                  </note> In this confuſion the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerving
how Mens minds began to be divided, and that there were
ſome who talked of Reforming the Clergy, and the corruptions
which they ſaid were crept into the Church, they addreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to <hi>Bonnivard,</hi> Prior of S. <hi>Victor,</hi> who had the reputation of
an honeſt and knowing Man, to have his advice in this matter.
Who made them this bold anſwer, <hi>If you will be ruled by me, you ſhall
do one of theſe two things: That is, If you continue debauched, as ye are
at preſent, you muſt not wonder if others be ſo too. And,</hi> Secondly,
<hi>If you will reform the Clergy, you muſt firſt ſhew them the way by your
good examples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe and other Remonſtrances, which he afterwards made
them, gave them occaſion to pry more narrowly into Religious
matters. The Fugitive <hi>Mammeluſſes</hi> had obtained of the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Vienna,</hi> a Writ of Excommunication, upon their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
againſt the <hi>Genevoiſes,</hi> which they cauſed to be ſet up. It
hapned that <hi>Bonnivard</hi> travelling to <hi>Berne,</hi> with the Deputies of
<hi>Geneva,</hi> was minded to read this Excommunication, ſet up on the
Church porch, in the Road to <hi>Switzerland.</hi> But the Deputies bade
him have a care what he did: <hi>For as ſoon as ever you ſhall have
read it,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>you will ſtand excommunicated. Bonnivard,</hi> ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at their ſcrupulous ſimplicity, replied, <hi>You are much miſtaken,
for if ye have condemned the</hi> Mammeluſſes <hi>unjuſtly, ye are excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
by God himſelf; but if juſtly, what power has the Archbiſhop
of</hi> Vienna <hi>over your Conſciences?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe ſolid Diſcourſes, together with the Exhortations of the
<hi>Bernoiſes,</hi> inſpired the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> with courage to deny firſt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Pope, although they had not then renounced the
Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and theſe Sparks were the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of a greater Fire which would be kindled amongſt them.</p>
               <p>About the end of this year, before <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> the Fraternity of

<hi>Geneva.</hi> They were permitted to paſs through the Town,
as they were wont heretofore. Their Captain <hi>Pontverre</hi> came
laſt. He entred through the Gate of <hi>La Corratiere,</hi> and would have
went through that of S. <hi>Gervais.</hi> But finding it ſhut, although
the Porter was endeavouring to open it, yet he falls into a Rage,
abuſing the poor fellow, and gave him a box on the Ear after he had
opened the Gate, ſaying, '<hi>S Bud, You Rogue, muſt Gentlemen wait
all this while?</hi> and continuing to ſwear, <hi>it ſhall not be long firſt,</hi> ſaid
he, <hi>before we ſhall beat down your Gates, and march over them as we
have done heretofore.</hi> Which having ſaid, he ſet Spurs to Horſe and
rode away.</p>
               <p>The Porter failed not to relate this to the Council and City; at
which the People, moved with inſtigation, ſaid, <hi>Will it not ſuffice
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50836:48"/>
them to do us all the injuries they are able out of our Walls, but they
muſt needs come in the City to affront us? Let what will happen, this
muſt not be ſuffered.</hi> Yet the Council durſt not openly ſhew their
indignation, the Suburb of S. <hi>Gervais</hi> being only incloſed with
Turfs of Earth, patched up in haſte upon report of Wars. Yet
Guards were placed there, as likewiſe on the Bridge of <hi>Rhoſne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the beginning of the following year,<note place="margin">1529.</note> about twilight, <hi>Pont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verre,</hi>
accompanied with three other Horſe-men,<note place="margin">Jan. 2.</note> entred again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Town.<note place="margin">Pontverre <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Geneva.</note> He was diſcovered on the Bridge, although he muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
himſelf in his Cloke; when immediately there aroſe a cry,
<hi>Here is</hi> Pontverre, <hi>here is</hi> Pontverre. They who were neareſt him,
clapped their Hands to their Swords, as he for his part did the
like, endeavouring to defend himſelf in his retreat: but he could
not ſo well guard himſelf, but that he received an ugly blow on
his Noſe. Yet he, together with his companions, makes his way
through the crowd; one of them who was with him was Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de S. Simon,</hi> who endeavouring to get to the Gate of <hi>la Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raterie,</hi>
he found it ſhut. <hi>Pontverre</hi> knowing not where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
himſelf, he climbs up the Stairs of the Hoſpital <hi>de la Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noye,</hi>
upon his Horſe; and being at the top, he lights off and hides
himſelf under a Bed. They purſued him; and having found him,
they made at him with their Rapiers, one of them pricking him
in the Thigh, which made him crawle out in a fury; he wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Amy Bandiers</hi> with his Dagger. But he was immediately ſo
beſet on every ſide with blows, that he was ſoon killed in the
place. The <hi>Syndick, Amy Girard,</hi> being preſent, cauſed the Clothes
and Arms of <hi>Pontverre</hi> to be delivered to his Companions, whom
they conducted beyond the <hi>Arve,</hi> leſt the People ſhould ſerve them
as they did the Captain; his Body was conveyed to the Chappel
of the Hoſpital of <hi>Monnoye,</hi> and viewed by the <hi>Syndicks:</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dead, there was no remedy. Two days after he was interred
by mada <hi>de Brandis;</hi> who having obtained leave, ſhe cauſed him
to be carried to the Convent of <hi>Rive,</hi> and to be buried in the
Chappel belonging to the Family of the <hi>Terny's.</hi> There was
found about him Orders relating to his Military Office, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning
his Men to appear at ſuch a place of Rendeſvous, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled
in White.</p>
               <p>The Gentlemen of the <hi>Spoon</hi> were extreamly inraged at his
death,<note place="margin">Fraternity of the <hi>Spoon</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at <hi>Pont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verre</hi>'s death.</note> eſpecially the Baron of <hi>La Sara,</hi> who threatned more than
he could do: and <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> Governor of <hi>Bellevaux,</hi> who
afterwards laid down his Gown, and took up the Sword, naming
himſelf Monſieur of <hi>Rolle,</hi> (from a Mannor he had purchaſed,
known by that Title) They made their complaint to the Duke,
who was not much moved at the matter, yet he ſent Deputies
into <hi>Switzerland</hi> to have ſatisfaction. The <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to go there to juſtifie themſelves; but the ways were ſo block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up by the Dukes Party, that it was impoſſible to get ſafe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.
Yet <hi>Vandelly</hi> ventured on the Lake, taking the advantage of
the Wind, and got to <hi>Berne;</hi> where he ſo well anſwered the Duke
of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Deputy, that the <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> remained ſatisfied that the
<hi>Genevoiſes</hi> Fact was not ſo hainous as it was repreſented. The
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50836:48"/>
                  <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> made up an agreement betwixt them, and <hi>Vandelly</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>
               <p>Yet the Confraternity of the <hi>Spoon</hi> ceaſed not to moleſt the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note place="margin">1529.</note>

to the payment of a certain ſumm of mony towards the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> coming up to the Gates to the number of 800, with
Ladders to ſcale the Town.<note place="margin">March 25.</note> But their courage failed them; a
Gentleman who had promiſed them 1400 Men, having failed in his
promiſe. The Dukes declarations, which enjoyned theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to forbear moleſting the <hi>Genevoiſes,</hi> were not obſerved: for
the Confraternity, having the whole Country at their command,
did but laugh at theſe orders. Several Houſes about <hi>Geneva</hi> were
plundered.</p>
               <p>The remaining part of the year was ſpent in Deputations from
the Allies of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the Biſhop, in order to
the diſannulling of this confraternity; on which theſe two laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
inſiſted as prejudicial to their Liberties. The Duke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
his Reaſons in the Aſſembly at <hi>Payerne,</hi> which were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered

The Deputies of <hi>Geneva</hi> made their Addreſſes to the <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſes</hi>
and <hi>Fribourgers,</hi> who told them they would break off with the
Duke, and continue the Alliance with them. Which they did, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

               </p>
               <p>About this time there was held a General Council, wherein
the <hi>Syndicks</hi> complain'd they could not attend ſo much to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the City: and ſeeing the Biſhop laid aſide all buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
it were better to depute Judges for this matter. Which
propoſal being approved, <hi>Claudius Richardet</hi> was choſen Steward,
and had Four Aſſiſtants allotted him,<note place="margin">Nov. 14.</note> who have been ſince called
Auditors.<note place="margin">Nicolin du Creſt, Girardin <hi>of</hi> La Rive, Claudius Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, John Balurd.</note> This having been heretofore the <hi>Vidame</hi>'s Office, the
Biſhop was ſent to for his approbation of this choice, who was
at that time in the <hi>Franche-Comté.</hi> He privately told the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
He was very well ſatisfied, but he would have his conſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50836:49"/>
from the Duke, becauſe he did not like to be troubled with
him: for he had promiſed never to come into <hi>Geneva</hi> but in the
Dukes company. There were ſent other Deputies to him, who
were not ſuffered to ſpeak with him.</p>
               <p>In the year following,<note place="margin">1530.</note> the Plague raging in <hi>Geneva,</hi> there was
one <hi>Michael Caddoz,</hi> who pretending to be ſtruck with it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to be put into the Hoſpital.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Caddoz</hi> ſpreads a Plague in <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </note> Which being granted, and his
forty days expired, he began to acquaint himſelf with the Keeper
of the Hoſpital, with the Prieſt, and ſeveral poor People belonging
to it, who commonly for a ſmall gain were wont to perfume and
clean the Sores of the infected. <hi>Caddoz</hi> finding them diſpoſed to
hearken to his pernicious deſigns; he thereupon propoſes to them
an infallible means to get mony in bringing the Plague where it
had not yet been, eſpecially in great Houſes, whoſe Eſtates might
fall to them by Inheritance; or otherwiſe they might pilfer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
controul. They needed not much entreaty, all the difficulty
lay in the manner how they ſhould effect this. They concluded then
to make a peſtilential powder of Linen-rags, with which they had
wiped the Sores of the ſick, and to diſperſe them in ſeveral places.
<hi>Caddoz</hi> paſſing then one day over the Bridge of <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> let fall
a Linen-Cloth, thinking no body had ſeen him; but a certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
perceiving he had dropt ſomething, cried out, <hi>This Raſcal</hi> Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doz
<hi>hath let fall a Cloth, in which I believe there's not any thing of
value;</hi> which ſaid, he would have taken it up. Another more
cautious, bid him have a care what he handled. They therefore
with a Stick tumbled open this packet, from whence proceeded
ſuch a ſtink as infected the whole Bridge, no Body know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whence it came. There was a Woman ſent for, lately reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
of the Plague, who ſeeing it, ſaid, It was the matter of a
Plague-ſore. The <hi>Syndicks</hi> informed of the buſineſs, cauſed <hi>Caddoz</hi>
to be apprehended and carried to the Biſhoprick, where he was
examined. It being asked him, what was in that Cloth he had
dropt? He replied, It was the Corruption of a venereal Cancer
in his Leg. Being queſtioned what moved him to do it, He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
There were ſeveral who jeared him, becauſe he had the
Pox; whereupon he in revenge would give it them. The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
not content with this anſwer, ordered him to be put upon
the Rack. He then confeſſed it was deſigned for to breed the
Plague. He was examined again wherefore he did it: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
told them who were his Accomplices, and their deſigns, they
were apprehended: and he and the Keeper of the Hoſpital had
their Fleſh torn off with red hot Pinchers, their Heads cut off,
and their Bodies quartered; the Prieſt was degraded, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
executed. The Keeper of the Hoſpital's Son was much pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied,
being very young; but a word ſlipt from him, which coſt
him his life: for being demanded if he knew how to make this
Drug as well as his Father: He replied, Yes; and ſo was behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and immediately after the Plague ceaſed.</p>
               <p>In the Month following, the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> having granted to <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivard</hi>
a monthly allowance of four Crowns and a half, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the loſs of the Revenues of S. <hi>Victor,</hi> which the <hi>Savoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:50836:49"/>
had ſeized on, and which he had bequeathed, after his Death,
to the City of <hi>Geneva.</hi> The Duke being informed thereof, en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deavoured
to do him an injury. He had, to draw him into his
Dominions, given him a Letter of Safe-conduct, with which he
went to <hi>Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſſel,</hi> to viſit his Mother who lay ſick, being very ancient.
A while after he went to the Biſhop at <hi>Modon,</hi> where there was
held an Aſſembly. He became acquainted with <hi>Francis Neel,</hi> who
called himſelf Monſieur of <hi>Bellegarde:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bonnivard</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed.</note> he truſted a Gentleman
whom he gave him for his Guide and Companion to <hi>Lauſane;</hi>
but he was betrayed by this perfidious Wretch. For he had no
ſooner come up to the top of Mount <hi>Jura,</hi> but he was ſet upon
by one called <hi>Roſey</hi> of <hi>Thonon,</hi> who had eſpouſed one of D. <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi>
Baſtards, and Biſhop <hi>Eyries</hi> the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi>'s Baſtard.
Theſe were two deſperate Villains, who having ſpent their Eſtates
needed a Recruit which they expected from <hi>Bonnivard.</hi> Their
Accomplices at <hi>Modon</hi> had obſerved his Purſe, and it being full
of <hi>Parpilloles,</hi> which was a Coin uſed in thoſe days, of ſmall
value, all of them which he had about him, not amounting to
above twenty Crowns of Gold; they believed each piece was a
Crown. It was known ſince, the Duke did not give order to take
him, but <hi>Bellegarde</hi> and the others having written to him about it,
he conſented he ſhould be detained. <hi>Bonnivard</hi> perceiving he was
like to be ſet upon, ſpur'd on his Horſe, but being not well mounted,
he could not ride far, they ſoon overtaking him. Nevertheleſs
he loſt not his Courage, but clapt his hand to his Sword: but
his guide planting himſelf before him, gave the others opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to encloſe him; they took him, and then carried him away to
<hi>Chillon,</hi> where he remained Priſoner ſix years and an half: the firſt
two years he was not kept cloſe Priſoner, but the reſt of the time
he ſpent in a Dungeon which lay lower than the Lake, in which
the Duke, when he was at <hi>Chillon,</hi> cauſed him to be put. During
all which time he was not examined, nor put upon the Rack. At laſt
when the <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> had taken the Country of <hi>Vaud,</hi> they drew
him out thence. It was obſerved that he had hollowed and worn the
Rock by much walking in the Dungeon.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop favoured the Inſultings of the Gentlemen of the Spoon:<note place="margin">Auguſt</note>

from the Allies to the Duke availed nothing, becauſe
he could not hinder this diſorder,<note place="margin">Septemb.</note> and was moreover glad to ſee

having gathered Soldiers from all Parts, were reſolved to make

knew nothing of this laſt enterprize againſt <hi>Geneva,</hi> nor he neither:
although it was well known he was one of the Captains.</p>
               <p>The Commanders of the Army of the Confederates ſent to <hi>Geneva,</hi>
bidding them appoint a place of Treaty, but they deſired they might
be excuſed, deſiring to ſpeak with them firſt, to conſult together
what was needful to be done. The Army then began to diſincamp
from <hi>Morges,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Caſtle of <hi>Rolle</hi> burnt.</note> having fired, as they paſſed, the Caſtle of <hi>Rolle,</hi> and
moſt of the other Caſtles which belonged to the Gentlemen of
the Spoon, whoſe Garriſons were retreated to <hi>Thonon</hi> or into <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy;</hi>
all the Goods in them were burnt, and the Country of <hi>Vaud</hi>
almoſt ruined. A Party of <hi>Fribourgers,</hi> with the <hi>Genevoiſes,</hi> pillaged
the Villages about the City, and could not be withheld, alledging
for their excuſe, <hi>That they would not dye with Hunger.</hi> Six ſcore
Musketeers belonging to <hi>Geneva,</hi> came to ſeek Forage at <hi>Megrim,</hi>
where the alarm Bell ſounding, they perceived they were diſcovered
by a Body of eight or nine hundred Foot, and fifty Horſe, who had
divided themſelves into three Companies, one of which lay in
ambuſh in the Wood, and the two others lay along the ſide of
the neighbouring Mountains; they came to the Wood, and ſet
upon them there ſo vigorouſly, that they left ſixty dead on the
place, the reſt were either taken or fled. Which affrighted the
two other Companies ſo, that they retreated as faſt as they could,
the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> having loſt in this Encounter but one young Man,
who was killed, having parted from his Company to fly away.</p>
               <p>Two days after came the Army of the two Cities,<note place="margin">Octob. 8.</note> and were
quartered both of them in <hi>Geneva;</hi> where it was no ſooner arrived,
but there was a Diſcourſe of a Treaty of Peace with the Duke.
S. <hi>Julian</hi> was pitcht upon for the place,<note place="margin">Octob. 10.</note> where the Deputies were
to have ſafe Paſſage.<note place="margin">A Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</note> A Peace was haſtily concluded, leaving
the Differences about the <hi>Vidomnat</hi> or Stewardſhip, to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
in the next Aſſembly, which was to be held in <hi>Switzerland,</hi>
as alſo the Charges of the War. It was agreed, that Priſoners
ſhould be releaſed on both ſides, and that no acts of Hoſtility
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50836:50"/>
ſhould paſs from either Party, under Penalty on the Dukes part
of the Forfeiture of the Country of <hi>Vaud;</hi> and on the <hi>Genevoiſes,</hi>
of the revocation of the Alliance. Which done, the Army de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
home, having remained ten days in the City, which
had been eaten up within by Friends, and plundred without by
Enemies. The Gentlemen of the Spoon threatened it continually,
becauſe their Caſtles were burnt.</p>
               <p>Neither did the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ceaſe from raiſing Soldiers. The
Confederates ſent notice to the City, that there were 10000 Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
at <hi>Montbeilliard,</hi> whom the Earl of <hi>Genevoiſe</hi> had raiſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<hi>Geneva.</hi> Upon which they deſired them to ſend a Company
of two hundred Men to ſtrengthen the City Guards.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time there was an Aſſembly held at <hi>Payerne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1530.</note> where
both the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> and his Highneſs had their Deputies.<note place="margin">Dec. 3.</note> The
Duke required that the Alliance with <hi>Geneva</hi> ſhould be cancelled,<note place="margin">Aſſembly at <hi>Payerne.</hi>
                  </note>
as it was determined by the Earl of <hi>Gruyeres;</hi> and that the <hi>Vidomnat</hi>
or Stewardſhip, and other Rights which he had in the City, ſhould
be reſtored; that the Exiles ſhould have their Honours and Eſtates
returned them, and that the two Cities ſhould pay him two hundred
thouſand Crowns for the Charges of the War. The Deputies of
the <hi>Cantons</hi> would have put the matter to Arbitration, chuſing
the Emperor Judge in the caſe: but the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> refuſed to ſtand
to his deciſion, chuſing rather that their Cauſe ſhould be legally
debated before the <hi>Cantons,</hi> who promiſed to determine it without
partiality.</p>
               <p>On the 21th of <hi>December</hi> they thus decided it touching the
Stewardſhip,<note place="margin">Dec. 21.</note> that it ſhould be reſtored to his Highneſs: that the
buſineſs of the Exiles ſhould remain as it was: that the Alliance
with <hi>Geneva</hi> ſhould hold firm, and that <hi>Bonnivard</hi> ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed:
that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſhould pay to the three Cities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the Charge of the War one and twenty thouſand Crowns
at three Payments; which Summ he might require of the Biſhop
and his diſobedient Gentlemen, who could never raiſe ſo many
Soldiers without his knowledge; and in ſhort, that the Treaty of
S. <hi>Julian</hi> ſhould be obſerved.</p>
               <p>The Duke conſented only to thoſe Articles which favoured him,
but he would not hearken to thoſe Propoſals which concerned the
Payment of the Money, nor the releaſement of <hi>Bonnivard,</hi> whom
he looked upon as a Perſon able to do him miſchief. He choſe
a Steward, and ſent him to be eſtabliſhed at <hi>Geneva.</hi> The Council
demanded the ſeven thouſand Crowns which remained due, and
why <hi>Bonnivard</hi> was not releaſed: to all which they had no anſwer.
Upon this there aroſe new Troubles, and there were continual
Deputations on both ſides to remove this Difference.</p>
               <p>Theſe Jars made the <hi>Syndicks</hi> think of fortifying the City,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Geneva</hi> forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> and
to encompaſs S. <hi>Gervais</hi> with Walls, and farther to joyn the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
of <hi>Four</hi> to the City, and to pull down the other Suburbs,
which were only a hinderance to its defence. Wherefore it will
not be needleſs to ſhew the Condition it was then in. There
were at that preſent, beſides the Boroughs of S. <hi>Gervais</hi> and <hi>de Four,</hi>
which are now incorporated into the City, theſe four other follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50836:51"/>
Suburbs, <hi>viz.</hi> the Borough of <hi>Rive,</hi> which reached from the
Gate, bearing the ſame name, to <hi>Eaux Vives.</hi> That of S. <hi>Victor,</hi>
as far as S. <hi>Legier,</hi> which reached beyond the large Palace, even
to the Bridge of <hi>Arve;</hi> and the other which extended from
<hi>La Corraterie</hi> as far as the Poſt-houſe. Theſe four Boroughs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
near as many Houſes as the City, and were almoſt all of
them pulled down, to bring it into a round Form, and to make
it compact, and inſtead of ſix Gates which it had, there were
only left two. The Bulwarks were made of the Materials of the
Suburbs: The City, with its out parts, contained ſeven Pariſhes;
the firſt was that wherein ſtood the Cathedral of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> under
the Title of the Holy Croſs;<note place="margin">Deſcription of the City.</note> the ſecond, a little diſtant from
S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, was called our new <hi>Ladies</hi> Pariſh, which ſerves at
preſent for an Auditory, wherein Divinity Lectures are read:
the third was S. <hi>Magdalens;</hi> the fourth S. <hi>Germans;</hi> the fifth
S. <hi>Gervais</hi>'s; the ſixth S. <hi>Legier</hi>'s; and the ſeventh S. <hi>Victor</hi>'s,
where ſtood the Church of the ſame Name. Theſe two laſt Pariſhes
were demoliſhed. There were three Monaſteries in the City, and
two in the Suburbs: thoſe in the City were the Convent of the Grey
Friers at <hi>de Rive;</hi> and the Nunnery of S. <hi>Clare,</hi> where now
ſtandeth an Hoſpital; the white Friers were ſeated in the Street
of <hi>La Corraterie,</hi> in a Convent called the Palace, by reaſon of its
largeneſs; wherein the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> have been often entertained,
and where ſtood the Clock on the Bridge of <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> which was
conſumed when the Bridge was burnt in the year 1670. Without
the City there was the Monaſtery of S. <hi>Victor,</hi> of the Order of
<hi>Clugny,</hi> with a Prior and nine Monks, who lived on its Revenue.
It is thought that formerly this was a Temple dedicated to <hi>Mars,
Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> which was ſince conſecrated to S. <hi>Victor,</hi>
S. <hi>Vincent,</hi> and S. <hi>Ours,</hi> although the firſt was its right name.
Though there was a Convent of <hi>Auguſtin</hi> Monks near the Bridge
of <hi>Arve,</hi> called, <hi>our Lady of Grace;</hi> becauſe the Baſtard <hi>René</hi> had
cauſed a fair Picture of our Lady to be drawn, which he ordered
to be ſet up in the Chappel he had built: and from the gracefulneſs
of this Picture, hath the name been derived, as it is commonly
received: but it is more likely this name hath proceeded from the
Graces which ſhe hath beſtowed: for it was declared that ſhe
wrought great Miracles, and particularly raiſed up Children to
Life, which were brought from all Parts to be baptized in that
Chappel; there was likewiſe another Abby of rich Monks at
S. <hi>John</hi>'s in the Groves, over againſt the Tower; there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other Chappels, as beyond <hi>de Rive,</hi> one called the Temple,
otherwiſe S. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Chappel, where ſtill-born Children
were buried; another Called S. <hi>Margaret</hi>'s, another S. <hi>Laurence</hi>'s,
and another of our Ladies of the Bridge, where at preſent ſtands
the coining Houſe. There were beſides ſeven Hoſpitals, which
have ſince been reduced to two, the common Hoſpital, and the
Hoſpital for the infected near the large Palace.</p>
               <p>Theſe Differences with the Duke ſtill continued; he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
all manner of Proviſion to be brought into the City.<note place="margin">1532.</note> There
was a report that he had ſent for ten thouſand <hi>Italians</hi> and three
hundred <hi>Lancers</hi> to aſſiſt him againſt <hi>Geneva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:50836:51"/>
Theſe Differences were followed by others,<note place="margin">June 9.</note> which aroſe amongſt
the Citizens about Religion.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion begun to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſome young men in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va.</hi>
                  </note> Some young Men of <hi>Geneva</hi> had ſet
up, at every corner of the Streets, certain Articles whereby it was
apparently ſeen, they were inclining to the Proteſtant Religion;
upon which one <hi>Verly</hi> a Chanon of <hi>Fribourg,</hi> having taken a young
Man named <hi>John Goulas,</hi> who had paſted up a Bill on the Pillar
before S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church; he gave him a box on the Ear, and
drew out his Sword: for at that time the Chanons wore Swords
in <hi>Geneva. Goulas</hi> put himſelf in a poſture of defence, and wounded
the Chanon in the arm. There were two perſons of the Borough
of <hi>Four,</hi> who taking the Chanons part were likewiſe wounded; the
<hi>Syndicks</hi> obſerving theſe diviſions among the people, made a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
enjoyning all perſons to live peaceably, and to ſet up no
more of thoſe kind of Writings, nor broach any novelty without their
permiſſion.</p>
               <p>During theſe tranſactions,<note place="margin">1532.</note> two Miniſters came to <hi>Geneva,</hi> viz.
<hi>William Farel</hi> of <hi>Gap,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Septem.</note> and <hi>Anthony Saunier,</hi> who came from preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <hi>Farel</hi> comes to <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </note> They had Letters of recommendation from <hi>Berne,</hi>
and being ſettled at <hi>Geneva,</hi> they held ſeveral diſcourſes in their
houſes to make the people underſtand the Doctrine they taught.
There were ſeveral who hearkned to them, and wiſhed the City
would follow the example of <hi>Berne:</hi> but this being noiſed abroad,
the Chanons and Prieſts reſolved to remedy this for the future. They
cited then <hi>Farel</hi> and <hi>Saunier</hi> before the Epiſcopal Council, where
were preſent the two <hi>Syndicks,</hi> who had promiſed to ſhelter them
from all danger, if they would maintain their Doctrine before the
Prieſts.</p>
               <p>After ſeveral diſputes and diſcourſes on both ſides,<note place="margin">1532.</note> it was decreed
by the Epiſcopal Council,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Saunier</hi> and <hi>Farel</hi> baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the City.</note> that they ſhould leave the Town upon pain
of Impriſonment. They departed then, being accompanied by ſome
Citizens who favoured them, and went and Preached at <hi>Orbe</hi> and at
<hi>Granſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A while after came to <hi>Geneva</hi> a young man of <hi>Dauphiny,</hi> named
<hi>Anthony Froment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fromènt</hi> comes to <hi>Geneva.</hi>

both men and women, whoſe number every day encreaſed
notwithſtanding the peoples muttering; ſaying, that <hi>Froment</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted
the women after him. There was a Grey-Frier called <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher
Bouquet,</hi> who was a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> in his heart, for he was ſo far
from oppoſing that Doctrine then ſpringing up, that commonly one

to us the word of God. Froment</hi> then having begun again his diſcourſe,
the City Serjeant came thereupon and commanded him to forbear.
He anſwered, it was better to obey God than man, and ſo held on
his diſcourſe: the Council being Aſſembled upon this occaſion, gave
Order that he ſhould be ſpeedily apprehended; and ſent men well
armed to lay hold on him, but he eſcaped into a Citizens houſe
where he lay concealed. There was an Order from the Magiſtrates
forbidding ſuch kind of Preaching upon penalty of undergoing the
Strapado; a while after <hi>Froment</hi> not being able to ſtay any longer in
ſafety at <hi>Geneva,</hi> left the Town in the night, and returned from

ſatisfied: yet the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ceaſed not to Aſſemble themſelves in
ſeveral houſes, where ſtrangers and the moſt knowing amongſt
themſelves, interpreted the holy Scripture. They received their firſt
Communion in a Garden out of Town, where one called Mr. <hi>John
Guerin</hi> a Capmaker diſtributed it; the Common people eſteemed
him learned in Divinity, although he was but a Mechanick; ſome
days after, ſearch being made after him, he fled, and was afterwards
Miniſter of <hi>New Caſtle.</hi>

<hi>Lutherans;</hi> the Council had much ado to appeaſe them, promiſing to

the Articles of Peace which were to be obſerved ſworn, there
was a diſturbance raiſed at <hi>Molard</hi> between certain particular perſons
of both parties who drew their ſwords, and yet a while after drank
together and were friends. Whilſt they had their ſwords drawn,
<hi>Marin Verſonnex</hi> ran to the Prieſts at S. <hi>Peters</hi> for help, who cauſed
the Bell to be rung. The Chanon <hi>Verley</hi> came one of the firſt, ſaying,
he would loſe his life for the Chriſtian Faith: he was Armed from
head to foot, holding his naked ſword in both his hands, crying out,
<hi>Follow me good Chriſtians, dear God, where are theſe</hi> Lutherans? This
alarm raiſed indifferently both parties to the number of one thouſand
five hundred, ſome ſwords were drawn; and <hi>Verly</hi> who ſaw the
place too hot for him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verly</hi> ſlain.</note> when he would have gotten away, was killed;
it was not known who did it, becauſe it was dark. The <hi>Syndick John
Coquet</hi> having run in to part them, was wounded in the head. At
length both parties withdrew at the sollicitation of the <hi>Syndicks; Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonnex</hi>
and <hi>Marguillier</hi> were impriſoned for alarming the City.</p>
               <p>The next morning <hi>Verly</hi> was honourably buried;<note place="margin">May 5.</note> and becauſe he
belonged to <hi>Fribourg,</hi> Letters were ſent to the Magiſtrates of that
Canton, informing them how that they were making ſearch after
them who had killed him, to do juſtice on them. Two of his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
together with an Herald came with Letters from <hi>Fribourg</hi> to
demand his body, which was granted them. Some days after they
came again requiring juſtice to be done, not only on thoſe who had
killéd him, but who were likewiſe preſent, and who did not hinder
the Murther; and amongſt others on the Syndick <hi>Coquet.</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
that he was preſent with his Syndicks-ſtaff according to the
duty of his Office, and that he had endeavoured to the utmoſt of his
power to ſuppreſs this tumult.</p>
               <p>After this Deputies from <hi>Berne</hi> preſented themſelves before the
Council,<note place="margin">May 27.</note> to offer their mediation, and propoſed that every perſon
might be at liberty either to go hear Maſs or Sermons.<note place="margin">Liberty of Conſcience granted.</note> A month af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an Oath was taken to obſerve this propoſal for the future, and

The General Council being held, after a Maſs of the
Holy Ghoſt was celebrated, and a general Proceſſion, at which the
Biſhop aſſiſted with the Deputies from <hi>Fribourg,</hi> a Preſident of the

delayed upon the account of a difference betwixt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
and <hi>Syndicks</hi> about Juriſdiction in Caſes of life and
death, which the <hi>Syndicks</hi> would not yield to the Biſhop. The
<hi>Syndicks</hi> at the inſtance of the Attorny-General drew up an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
againſt nine Men and Woman, the greateſt part of which
were found not guilty: at night there was a Watch kept left the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
ſhould take away the Priſoners, and bring them to anſwer it at
his Bar. But whilſt theſe things were doing, he left the Town about
the midſt of <hi>July,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">July 15.</note> to take part with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> againſt the
City, although he was ſo ſtrictly bound to the contrary by the Oath
which he had taken not only at his Election to the Biſhoprick, but
likewiſe in making himſelf free of the City. The Council earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beſought him to ſet the City in Order, but whether he feared ſome
Tumult upon the account of the Priſoners, or that he had ſome
other ſecret deſign, he coloured over his departure with a pretence of
going into <hi>Franche Comté,</hi> where the Emperor held an Aſſembly of
the Eſtates, and he promiſed that he would ſhortly return.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verly</hi>'s relations returned home all but two who remained
at <hi>Gaillard</hi> with about twenty Soldiers, who ſued for juſtice to be
done on them who were guilty of the Murther. They who returned
met on mount <hi>Jura, Thomas Baudichon</hi> together with ſome Merchants

been in danger, his horſe having been already killed under him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Syndicks</hi> declared one part of the Priſoners innocent, which

before ever the Letters were read, imagined there were <hi>Luther an</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
come to Town, whereupon there aroſe immediately a great
diſturbance, the greateſt part taking up Arms, and ſticking ſmall
branches of Trees in their Caps for diſtinction. The Proctor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
likewiſe cauſed the Clergy to Arm themſelves. The Council
having debated the matter, would have delivered <hi>Furbity,</hi> againſt
whom the <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> had complained, into the grand Vicars Cuſtody,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50836:54"/>
but he would not receive him. He left not off Preaching, and affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
continually, that all thoſe who received the new doctrine were
people who lived ill, and that they were worſe than others. The
<hi>Syndicks</hi> wrote to <hi>Berne,</hi> the <hi>Furbity</hi> was under an Arreſt, and yet
they knew not wherein he had offended them, but if they had heard
him, they would not have ſuffered him, ſo greatly did they value
their Lordſhips friendſhip.</p>
               <p>Some days after this came an Herald from <hi>Fribourg,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Decem. 27</note> who deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

who had any <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> Bibles ſhould burn them, upon pain

               <p>Four days after arrived other Deputies from <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Fribourg.</hi>

Theſe laſt ſaid they underſtood there had been a great Tumult occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned

them, they would break off with them. They were anſwered, that
they deſigned to live as heretofore, according to what they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
determined. The Deputies from <hi>Berne</hi> urged the payment of the
charges of the former War, and demanded ſatisfaction for what <hi>Furbity</hi>
had ſaid againſt them. The <hi>Syndicks</hi> made anſwer they were ſorry, if
<hi>Furbity</hi> had done them any wrong, but that they had no power over
any Eccleſiaſtical perſon. The Deputies were not content with this
anſwer, threatning ſtill to break off with them; and in effect they
would have returned them the Letters of Aſſociation which they
flung on the Table. The Council inſtantly beſought them to take
them again; and to ſatisfie them, <hi>Furbity</hi> was cauſed to anſwer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the Town houſe, the <hi>Syndicks</hi> having firſt declared that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
not thereby to prejudice the Biſhops authority, nor the
Clergies priviledges. The Tryal was proſecuted upon condition both
parties ſhould ſubmit to the <hi>Syndicks</hi> deciſion, in the mean time a
Meſſenger returned, who had been ſent to the Biſhop into <hi>Franche
Comté,</hi> who brought word that the Biſhop would have <hi>Furbity</hi> ſent
back to the Spiritual Court.</p>
               <p>The Deputies from <hi>Berne</hi> returned,<note place="margin">Jan. 18.</note> and made the ſame demands as
heretofore, telling them moreover that their Superiors meant that
<hi>Furbity</hi> ſhould be tried by the <hi>Syndicks,</hi> and not by any others. They
required further, that a Miniſter ſhould be permitted to Preach in
the City to them who would hear him, and in caſe of refuſal to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
their Alliance.</p>
               <p>In the mean time there continually hapned ſome quarrel between

made both parties take up Arms; and had not the Deputies of <hi>Berne</hi>
interpoſed, there had been more miſchief: yet they would not lay
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50836:54"/>
down their Arms till Juſtice was done on the Murtherer, who had
gone and hid himſelf with <hi>Portery</hi> the Biſhops Secretary in S. <hi>Peters</hi>
Steeple,<note place="margin">1534.</note> that he might at midnight ring the great Bell; but the <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicks</hi>
underſtanding where he was, went thither and took him at

                     <hi>Pennet</hi> ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.</note> which made all quiet again. There were found

                  <note place="margin">Feb. 10.</note> 1534. which were read in the general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
at the time of the Election of the <hi>Syndicks;</hi> upon which occaſion
the <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> earneſtly exhorted the Council, not to ſuffer after this

Judges in matters of Life and Death, putting them in mind of the
laſt War which the Biſhop had been the chief inſtrument of in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
it: that for their parts they would maintain the Alliance with

was led on the Sunday following to S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church, where was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

into the Pulpit, he began as he was accuſtomed with the ſign of the
Croſs, and implored the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
of the bleſſed Virgin. The <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the
City ſeeing this, hindred him from proceeding in his Sermon; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he came there to make his Recantation: and immediately he was
haled down from the Pulpit and kept cloſe Priſoner.</p>
               <p>The Deputies from <hi>Berne</hi> were inſtant with the Council touching
four Articles.<note place="margin">Feb. 22.</note> Firſt, They demanded juſtice to be done on the Preacher,
who they ſaid had injured them.<note place="margin">Articles of the <hi>Bernoiſes,</hi> and their anſwer.</note> Secondly, They repreſented that
the Lent Preacher in the Convent of <hi>Rive</hi> taught erroneous Doctrine,
which they delivered in Writing. Thirdly, They required that one
of their Miniſters who had been expelled the Town, might be recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
Fourthly, That a Church might be granted them for one of
their Miniſters to Preach in during their abode in the City. To which
the <hi>Syndicks</hi> and Council thus replied.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, That they could not Repeal the Sentence of the Miniſters

They were anſwered, that they approved not of it, yet could they not

who were to meet together at <hi>Molard</hi> under a Red Colours, were
conſtrained to keep within doors for fear of the Guards, which
were doubled. The Enemies had ſent two perſons, to ſee if the
Gates of <hi>Rive</hi> and S. <hi>Anthonie</hi> were open: But when they ſaw
they were faſt ſhut, and that there was a Torch in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Steeple, which ſhewed that they within expected their coming,
they cried out one to another,<note place="margin">1434.</note> 
                  <hi>We are betrayed, we ſhall never enter
into</hi> Geneva, <hi>ſeeing we have failed this bout.</hi> So that this contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
was rendred ineffectual by the care of the <hi>Syndicks.</hi> The
Enemies finding themſelves, next Morning, near <hi>Gergonant,</hi> retired,
Drum beating and their Colours flying, contenting themſelves with
only plundering ſome Country houſes, and leading away Priſoner
<hi>Peter Vandel;</hi> who was returned by way of exchange for Monſieur
of <hi>Coudreé,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

withdrew into <hi>Burgundy</hi> whence he came, and ſome time after,
turned his Officers at <hi>Geneva</hi> out of their places, chuſing new
ones in their ſtead, and removed his Court to <hi>Gex.</hi> He deſigned
to have had the Seal of the Biſhoprick from <hi>Geneva,</hi> but the City
would not ſend it him.</p>
               <p>The Deputies of <hi>Geneva</hi> repreſented their grievances to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

complaining againſt the <hi>Genevoiſes,</hi> who had battered his
Arms in the Caſtle of the Iſle, and pulled down his Altar at S. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>
of <hi>Rive,</hi> and had excluded him from the Vidomnat or Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
which he would have reſtored him. He required moreover that
they would receive their Biſhop again. The <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
they would ſtand to the Agreement made at S. <hi>Julien</hi> and
<hi>Payerne.</hi> And as to what concerned the Biſhop, they durſt not
truſt him, and therefore would not permit his entrance. There
was a meeting held at <hi>Thonon,</hi> and another at <hi>Lucern,</hi> where the
Deputies of <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Geneva</hi> could effect nothing.</p>
               <p>The City received Letters from the <hi>French</hi>-King, informing them

as well as the Curate of S. <hi>Germans, Thomas Vandel,</hi> who had been
one of the Chanons of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> About this time the Proteſtant
party was the ſtrongeſt, there being three <hi>Syndicks</hi> of it. They
kept conſtantly with them a Captain and a Herald of <hi>Berne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1535.</note> under
pretence of the differences between the Duke and them, but in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

7 pieces of Cannon. They within, although they were but few
in number, yet defended themſelves moſt couragiouſly: they loſt
but one Man, but the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> two or three, beſides ſeveral that
were wounded. The Night being ſpent to no purpoſe, and the
Country round about being alarmed by break of day, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to relieve the beſieged, which made the Aſſailants withdraw.
This cauſed them of <hi>Penay</hi> to begin again to moleſt <hi>Geneva;</hi> and
that the more eagerly, becauſe the chiefeſt of them were for their
obſtinacy condemned to pay a Fine to the City of 100000 Crowns.
Theſe diſorders obliged them to finiſh the walling in of S. <hi>Gervais,</hi>
and to pull down the other Suburbs.</p>
               <p>Some days after, the Biſhops Chancellor, and the Judge in Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Matters, who had removed themſelves to <hi>Gex,</hi> cited the <hi>Gray

                  <note place="margin">May 30.</note> The Biſhop ſtrictly forbad the Catholicks of his Dioceſs,
and the Duke his Subjects to appear there. On the contrary, the
<hi>Syndicks</hi> encouraged both Parties to meet there, promiſing both
ſhould have a fair Hearing. Theſe diſputations laſted till S. <hi>John</hi>'s

Catholick Doctrine, <hi>viz. Caroli</hi> Dr. of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and a <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can

of the Palace, and on the 8th day of the ſame Month at
S. <hi>Peters,</hi> notice being firſt given by the ſound of the great Bell.
In the ſame day the Reliques and Images of the ſaid Church were
defaced and ſpoiled by the common People. The Statue of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi>
which ſtood at the entrance of the Church, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
overthrown, whereat underſtanding Men were much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed.</p>
               <p>The next Morning the three Captains, <hi>Nicholas Baudichon, Peter
Vandel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. 6.</note> and <hi>Amy Perrin,</hi> marched with their Companies, beating
their Drums as they went to S. <hi>Gervais,</hi> and to S. <hi>Dominick;</hi> where
they did yet worſe, for they ſpoiled a ſtately Picture which had
coſt 600 Ducats. And from thence they went to the Bridge of
<hi>Arve,</hi> to our Lady of <hi>Grace</hi>'s Church, where the <hi>Syndicks</hi> haſtned
with their Staves, to hinder them from demoliſhing the Chappel
of <hi>René</hi> of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the next day, <hi>Farel</hi> came and preached to the Council of

Heads of the afore-mentioned Diſputations to be read before them,
asking them whether they had any thing to object againſt them?
They anſwered, It belonged not to them to meddle with Articles
of Faith, which had been received and believed by their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Fathers.</p>
               <p>At length the <hi>Syndicks</hi> made an order,<note place="margin">Aug. 27.</note> That all the Citizens and

                  </note> utterly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Religion. The Nuns of S. <hi>Clare</hi> kept
to their old Priciples. There was only one <hi>Blaſine,</hi> the Daughter of
<hi>Dominick Varembel,</hi> who forſook the Monaſtery, and preſented her
requeſt to the Lieutenant, to the end the Siſters might give her a
Dowry. Which they refuſed, ſaying, She had brought nothing to
the Convent: yet to avoid all Suits of Law, they were content to
put the matter to a reference. There were ordered her 200 Crowns
to be paid out of the Houſholdſtuff of the Convent. They a
while after requeſted the <hi>Syndicks</hi> to have Maſs permitted them as
heretofore, or otherwiſe leave to depart the City. The <hi>Syndicks</hi>
anſwer was, That they might either ſtay or go. So that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to depart to <hi>Vitry,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Anecy,</hi> where the
Duke cauſed a Convent to be fitted up for them.</p>
               <p>

                  </note> according to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,

were but Nine, and there were ſome of them who for 30 years
together had not ſtirred out of the Convent. They reached no
farther than S. <hi>Julien</hi> all that day, which is but a League diſtant
from <hi>Geneva.</hi> And they were moreover ſo aſtoniſhed to find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the open Fields, that in ſeeing either Cows or Sheep they
took them for Lyons and Bears, according to Siſter <hi>Juſſie</hi>'s relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who hath deſcribed this Sally, in a little Book called, <hi>The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Hereſie of</hi> Geneva. This Book is written with all
the ſimplicity and confuſion, which could be expected from a poor
Nun; for ſhe was, as well as her Companions, in great fear before
ſhe got away, thinking every minute they ſhould have ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
offered them. Yet, as may be ſeen in this relation, they
were more afraid than hurt. The greateſt miſchief they received,
was an Exhortation to leave their Veils and Marry. <hi>Farel</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their Convent, and took his Text from theſe words of the
bleſſed Virgin, <hi>Exſurgens Maria abiit in montana: And Mary aroſe
and went into the hill country.</hi> Shewing them, That ſhe was never
a Recluſe, although a perfect pattern of Holineſs. But this ſhook
not their conſtancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baudichon</hi> a while after was choſen Captain General,<note place="margin">

them of the Country of <hi>Gex:</hi> but the Deputies of <hi>Berne</hi> cauſed
them to be disbanded, promiſing to reconcile the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Genevoiſes,</hi> and the Duke and them of <hi>Penay.</hi> This did
not at all pleaſe the <hi>Genevoiſes,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Savoyards</hi> had detained

               <p>The Proteſtants continued to pull down the Images, and ſpoil

The Country People kept ſtill to the Catholick Religion. The
Magiſtrates cauſed a Convocation of all the Prieſts in their Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to be held, who were told by the Principal <hi>Syndick, Farel</hi>
and <hi>Bonnivard</hi> being then preſent, That if they did not make it
appear from the Holy Scriptures, before <hi>Whit-Sunday,</hi> That the
Maſs, and other Popiſh Inſtitutions, were approved of by God, they
ſhould no longer be permitted the exerciſe of them. The anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteſt
of them, in the name of all the reſt, made this ingenious
reply: <hi>My Lords</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>We are not a little ſurprized at this ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
command, to forſake without any farther deliberation a Religion,
which hath been received for ſo many Ages as holy and ſafe, without the
leaſt conviction of the contrary. Ye have indeed left this Religion,
but not in a moment of time, as ye expect we ſhould do, ſeeing ye have
had ſeveral Sermons for your inſtruction. And although we are your
moſt humble Subjects, yet are we nevertheleſs Chriſtians, Redeemed by the
Blood of Chriſt, as well as your ſelves, and as much concerned for our
own Salvation as ye can be for yours. We therefore intreat you for
our Saviours ſake, our common Lord, That you would give us the ſame
liberty ye have taken your ſelves. Send us Preachers who can inſtruct
and ſhew us wherein we err, and then, if they can convince us, we ſhall
without further delay follow your example, and ſubmit our ſelves wholly
to your diſpoſal.</hi> The chief <hi>Syndick</hi> having heard this anſwer, cauſed
them to withdraw, that he might conſult on the matter. <hi>Bonni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vard</hi>
was of opinion it were expedient to grant their requeſt, and
not to force their Conſciences, but to inform them: for if they
ſhould ſhew themſelves ſo light, ſaid he, as to paſs ſo ſoon and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
from one Religion to another, it was to be feared they would
on the next occaſion return to the old one again. Whereas <hi>Farel</hi> on
the contrary, being leſs moderate, anſwered him, ſaying, <hi>Will you
hinder the immediate work of God?</hi> And proceeding in his Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
he made the Lords conſent to his opinion. The Prieſts
were again ſent for in, and had the ſame command laid on them
as before. Some who ſaid Maſs privately in the City, were found
out and brought to <hi>Farel,</hi> who ſharply reprehended them. The
Country People were enraged at this, and would have returned
as bad, or rather worſe, uſage to the Miniſters who preached
about in the Villages, had they not been well guarded.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> inſiſted ſtill on their old demands,<note place="margin">1536.</note> and there was
a Meeting appointed to be held in <hi>Berne</hi> to decide fairly this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.<note place="margin">Aug. 7.</note>
The Alliance between the two Cities was confirmed to
laſt for 25 Years on theſe conditions: That the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> ſhould
pay in ſix Months time, to the <hi>Bernoiſes,</hi> the ſumm of ten thouſand
Crowns, for the charge of the War: that they ſhould give them
entrance into their City as oft as they had occaſion: and that
they ſhould quit to them the Lordſhip of <hi>Gaillard,</hi> the Abby of
<hi>Bellerive,</hi> and the Caſtle of <hi>Cholex.</hi> The <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> keeping in their
own poſſeſſion the <hi>Vidomnat</hi> or Stewardſhip, the Revenues of the
Biſhoprick and of the Priory of S. <hi>Victor,</hi> which they deſigned as
a maintenance for Miniſters and the Hoſpital.</p>
               <p>It was about this time that <hi>John Calvin</hi> of <hi>Noyon</hi> in <hi>Picardy,</hi>

the direct Road, came to paſs through <hi>Geneva,</hi> not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to tarry there. Yet <hi>Farel</hi> knowing him to be a learned Man,
would needs retain him. Which he would not a long time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to; till <hi>Farel</hi> was ſo urgent with him as to admit of no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
deſiring him only to read Lectures in Divinity.<note place="margin">Sept.</note> A while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> cauſed publick Diſputations to be held at <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſane,</hi>
to which he was called, together with <hi>Farel</hi> and <hi>Viret,</hi> who
was now become a Preacher. The Proteſtant Religion was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by theſe Diſputes, and the Catholick baniſhed. The <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſes</hi>
would have had the Monks of <hi>Payerne</hi> to receive the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Doctrine: but they refuſed it, being upheld by the <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgers,</hi>
who had an equal right with the <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> in this Abby:
And upon this account theſe two <hi>Cantons</hi> were like to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in a War. The latter of theſe had already ſent to <hi>Geneva</hi>
for 200 Men to aſſiſt them, but the other <hi>Cantons</hi> interpoſing they
were made Friends.</p>
               <p>In the Month of <hi>March,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1537.</note> in the Year following, there came a

                  </note> who publickly diſputed

maintaining, amongſt the reſt, That the Baptizing of Infants was
unlawful, and that the Sacrament of Baptiſm ought not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered
to any but to thoſe who could give an account of their
Faith. <hi>Farel</hi> proved the contrary, and convinced him of ſeveral
other Errors held by the <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> He was, together with his
Companions, baniſhed the City; from whence they went to <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi>
where the <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> cauſed ſome of them to be put to
death.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters had another Diſputation with one <hi>Carolyn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">March 10.</note> who
undertook to prove the lawfulneſs of the Maſs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Carolyn</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Maſs.</note> and Prayers for the
dead. The Magiſtrates of <hi>Berne,</hi> having heard both Parties at <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſane,</hi>
baniſhed <hi>Carolyn</hi> out of their Dominions. <hi>Farel</hi> compiled a form
of Confeſſion, which was read every Sunday in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church.
But the <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> complained that theſe Conſtitutions were not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with theirs, for they obſerved ſtill ſome chief Feſtivals, and
uſed unleavened Bread in the Sacrament, and married Women af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the old cuſtom with their Hair diſcheveled; which <hi>Farel</hi> did
not approve. He was preſent at the Synod of <hi>Berne,</hi> conſiſting of
300 Divines from <hi>Switzerland, Strasbourg,</hi> and other neighbouring
Countries, who rejected the opinion of Conſubſtantiation, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal

               <p>The <hi>Syndicks</hi> for that Year favoured the diſcontented Party,<note place="margin">1538.</note> and

the Liberties and Priviledges of the City, and becauſe they would
not conform to the cuſtom of <hi>Berne</hi> in Celebrating the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,

                  <hi>Calvin</hi> had no

               </p>

Adminiſter the Sacrament with Wafers, was thrown into Priſon.
But he was ſoon releaſed,<note place="margin">Decemb.</note> and ſerved the City, together with the
other Miniſters, who were ſent for. out of the Villages. Their
opinion was required, before they were admitted, concerning the
old Ceremony of Womens being Married with their Hair hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down looſe about their Ears. They made anſwer, (for fear this
trifle ſhould hinder their entrance) That they did not find it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden

admitted, and gave the Communion, in the <hi>Eaſter</hi> following, <hi>with

<hi>Calvin</hi>'s baniſhment.</p>
               <p>This condemnation made a great noiſe, and moved the People
to Sedition, becauſe theſe Perſons were ſome of the Principal Men
in the City, and had great Friends. <hi>John Philippe,</hi> who was Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain
General, and had been <hi>Syndick</hi> in that Year, and moreover
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50836:63"/>
joyned in Friendſhip and in the ſame Faction with them, ſpake
publickly againſt it, and was the firſt Author of the Sedition:<note place="margin">

killed a Man with his Leading-ſtaff in this quarrel. And a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
on his ſide was ſlain in the place. The Council iſſued out
a Warrant to apprehend <hi>Philippe,</hi> who having ſhut himſelf up in
his Houſe, made ſome reſiſtance, there having been a Man ſhot
dead in this tumult; he got away at laſt over the tops of the Houſes,
and hid himſelf in the Stable belonging to the Tower of <hi>Perſe,</hi>
amongſt the Hay, where having been found out, he was carried
to Priſon. The <hi>Syndicks,</hi> with the Watch, guarded him from the
violence of the People, who otherwiſe would have torn him in
pieces. Whereupon we may obſerve the inconſtancy of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
and how little their Friendſhip is to be relied on. It was not
eight days ſince <hi>Philippe</hi> was exceedingly reſpected, and had more
credit than all the reſt of the <hi>Syndicks</hi> beſides; but now every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
exclaimed againſt him, and deſired he ſhould be put to death,
even thoſe who were moſt obliged to him. He had made a Party
who were no friends to the Proteſtants, and who had already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
the baniſhment of ſeveral Miniſters.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Artichauds</hi> Faction.</note> The two <hi>Syndicks</hi> who
were condemned, were of it. They were called <hi>Artichauds</hi> or <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychokes,</hi>
becauſe this Faction had taken theſe Plants to diſtinguiſh
themſelves, having cut down as many of theſe Roots as they
could find in the Gardens. It was likewiſe a word uſed in the
Wars amongſt them. Others ſay this word of <hi>Artichaud</hi> came by
corruption of Speech from <hi>Articlers,</hi> by reaſon of the Articles
which they had inſerted in the Treaty at <hi>Berne.</hi> The contrary
Faction had green Flowers for a mark of diſtinction, and their
word was <hi>Farel,</hi> which name was often heard about Streets, and
likewiſe that of <hi>Artichaud. Claudius Richardet,</hi> chief <hi>Syndick</hi> in
the Year 1538, one of the Principal of the <hi>Artichaud</hi> Faction, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been ingaged in this Sedition, would have made his eſcape
over the City Walls,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Richardet</hi> dies by a fall.</note> but being a corpulent Man he was ſo bruiſed
by the fall that he immediately killed himſelf. Theſe are the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
uſually attending diverſity of opinions in Religion. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippe</hi>
was condemned to loſe his Head, notwithſtanding the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the <hi>Bernoiſes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">June.</note> So that this Faction of the <hi>Artichauds</hi>
was very much daunted by the diſgrace of the four who were
<hi>Syndicks</hi> in the Year 1538, and who had been the chief upholders
of it. Yet the three Deputies at length obtained favour by the
interceſſion of them of <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Baſle,</hi> and were only enjoyned to
make an humble acknowledgment of their fault before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of 200, and had a ſmall Fine laid upon them. Theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
made them think of calling back <hi>Calvin,</hi> who was buſied
in the Eccleſiaſtical Synods of the Empire.</p>
               <p>About the end of theſe troubles,<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> received Letters
from <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, Dated the eighth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1540. by which
he gave them to underſtand, that he had been informed, That they
of <hi>Berne</hi> ſollicited <hi>Geneva</hi> to do them Homage, which he did not
believe they would conſent to, ſtrictly charging them the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

<hi>Bernoiſes,</hi> to whom he intended to write, would deſiſt from theſe

he Intituled <hi>Theologia Germanica,</hi> and a Treatiſe of the old and

               <p>The City began again to be overſpread by the Plague,<note place="margin">1545.</note> it being
firſt brought thither (as it was thought) by ſome <hi>Switzers</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
who went to <hi>Italy</hi> in the <hi>French</hi>-Kings ſervice. A certain

                  </note> began to practiſe what he had
learned of him, carrying about the Plague in Rags and Linen-Cloths,
which had been bound about the Sores of the infected.
He had prevailed upon almoſt the Nurſes and Women who clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and perfumed the Houſholdſtuff of the infected. They had
gotten a bie-word amongſt them, by which they ſignified the
Plague, calling it <hi>Clauda,</hi> rejoycing upon the encreaſe of it. When
ever they met, they were wont to enquire one of another how
<hi>Clauda</hi> did. The anſwer was commonly, <hi>She is goood for nothing,
ſhe doth nothing but ſleep;</hi> or if there was any Houſe newly infected,
they were wont to anſwer, <hi>She is very well, ſhe makes way in ſuch
a place.</hi> A certain perſon named <hi>Bernard Tallent,</hi> one of <hi>Lentilles</hi>
Accomplices, was apprehended by the Bayliff of <hi>Thonon,</hi> to
whom he confeſſed the whole deſign; who ſent a Copy of his
confeſſion to <hi>Geneva.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Lentilles</hi> was laid hold on and
examined, but he would confeſs nothing whatſoever torment he
ſuffered. He was ſent to <hi>Thonon</hi> to be confronted by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
who maintained the charge againſt him; yet he ceaſed not
to deny it, for all the torments of the Rack which he again under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went,
even to that extremity as to have his Shoulder broken; at
which being let down, and put to Bed, he immediately died, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſaying any thing more, than only adviſing them to ſeize upon
all them who attended the Hoſpital. Which was done, and the

of ſeven Men and twenty four Women. They declared, that <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilles</hi>
had obliged them by horrid Oaths to execute their miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous

till they of <hi>Geneva</hi> were reduced to that extremity, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder

Man would ſcarce believe that ſo great a number of Perſons
ſhould be prevailed on to work ſo horrid a villany, had they not
all ſeverally confeſſed it, without communicating one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The Surgeon and two others had their Skins pulled off
from them alive with red hot Pinchers; ſome of theſe Wretches
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50836:65"/>
were taken in the very Fact whilſt their Companions were lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

carrying a Torch in his Hand throughout the City. <hi>Viret</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
receiving a Letter from <hi>Calvin,</hi> inſtead of carrying it to his
Maſter as he was directed, he delivered it to the <hi>Syndicks,</hi> who

Being ſent for to anſwer for this before them, he juſtified his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,

ſuffered to ſcoff at the Word of God, and to ſlight their Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
He left the City at the ſame time <hi>Farel</hi> departed from <hi>Neuf-chatel</hi>

he had ſaid as much as he could, <hi>Calvin</hi> preſented himſelf, and
anſwered moſt ingeniouſly to every Article for the ſpace of an

Holy Scripture, he quoted ſo many paſſages out of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> as
would make any Man believe he had ſtudied no other Author; ſo

                  <hi>Would to God that he who hath ſo much cited S.</hi> Auguſtin, <hi>had ſeen

made a diſtinct Oration to confirm what <hi>Calvin</hi> had ſaid before

with error. <hi>Bolſec</hi> was thereupon committed to Priſon, where
<hi>Calvin</hi> endeavoured to convince him of his error, as well by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Conferences as by Letters. A while after, by the conſent of
the Churches of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> he was baniſhed the City. 'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,

                     <hi>Bolſec</hi> writes <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Life.</note> he recanted in a full Synod at <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans:</hi>

their Miniſters to preach to the People a Doctrine which
they and all Men elſe ſo little underſtood. <hi>Troillet,</hi> who had been
an Hermit, openly cenſured likewiſe <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Inſtitutions. The
Council enjoyned him to be ſilent, but yet this hindred not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
diſturbances about this matter. The young people of the City
accuſing <hi>Calvin</hi> of Pride and too much Severity.</p>
               <p>About this time came <hi>Michael Servetus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug.</note> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who had
eſcaped out of Priſon from <hi>Vienna,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1553.</note> to <hi>Geneva,</hi> where he began to
dogmatize.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Servetus</hi> comes to <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </note> He had compoſed a Book, Intituled <hi>Chriſtianiſmi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutio,</hi>
full of execrable Hereſies. He annulled the diſtinction of
the three Perſons in the Godhead, affirming the Son and Holy
Ghoſt to have been Created in the beginning of the World. That
the Eſſence of God was common to all Creatures, even thoſe who
were inanimate, which brought forth in Man a free will, yet did
not this hinder, but that the knowledge of good and evil was
ſtifled in him till he was twenty years of age; before which time
a man could not commit any mortal ſin. That it was ſufficient
to believe that Jeſus Chriſt was the Son of God, it not being
abſolutely neceſſary to lay hold on his promiſes; All men, both
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> being juſtified by their good moral works.
That Baptiſm of Infants was but a meer foppery. At firſt he
was countenanced by ſome of the Magiſtrates who hated <hi>Calvin:</hi>
ſo that beſides his natural maliciouſneſs, he was ſo rude in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
his Blaſphemy, as to give <hi>Calvin</hi> the lye above fifty times
in one diſcourſe, and as often calling him wicked wretch, and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Magus.</hi> The Council could no longer endure his impudence,
and therefore committed him to Priſon; and Articles were drawn
up againſt him, which were ſent to the four Proteſtant <hi>Cantons</hi>
for their concurrence; after which he was burnt alive, not ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the leaſt ſign of repentance, but only a great fear of death.
Several were not diſpleaſed that ſo dangerous a perſon was rooted
out, who had ſowed his wicked Doctrine for the ſpace of thirty
years amongſt Chriſtians. Others thought he was puniſhed too
ſeverely, his Fact being only a matter of opinion, which was at
the bottom of it but only a mixture of <hi>Judaiſm</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſm,</hi>
and that it were better to have expected his repentance; which
occaſioned the ſetting forth of a Book, <hi>De non puniendis haereticis
gladio,</hi> compoſed, as it was thought, by <hi>Caſtalion,</hi> under the name
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50836:66"/>
of <hi>Martin Bellius,</hi> which Book was anſwered by <hi>Theodore Beza.</hi>
The Magiſtrates of <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Switzerland,</hi> who had condemned
<hi>Servetus,</hi> conſidered him as an Apoſtate, a Seducer, and an Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical

his Hereſies,<note place="margin">

In the Year following <hi>Matthew Grybalde Sieur</hi> of <hi>Farges</hi> ſpread the
ſame errors, but he would not enter into a publick conference with
<hi>Calvin,</hi> but withdrew into the Countries of <hi>Berne,</hi> where he made
his Recantation, yet living, as before, to the Year 1564. when he
died of the Plague.</p>
               <p>The City was fortified,<note place="margin">1554.</note> and the poor People of <hi>Merindol</hi> and
<hi>Cabrieres,</hi> who had fled for refuge to <hi>Geneva,</hi> were employed about
the work; the reaſon of this precaution was, That they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
given them by the <hi>Bernoiſes,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> had ſome deſign
upon them; and that which occaſioned this ſuſpicion was, The
great multitude of <hi>French</hi> men who had withdrawn thither. The

notice that he privately endeavoured to get ſome other Biſhoprick,
which was the occaſion that at his return he was more narrowly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
and his former life ſearched into. It was found that he had
a child before he was married, of her whom he had eſpouſed, and to
the end it might not be declared a Baſtard, he had forged a Contract
of an antedated Marriage, and falſe Seals, for a greater confirmation
to make his Son capable of his inheritance, which was very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;

whole matter, he was beheaded at <hi>Molard,</hi> being very penitent for
what he had done, expreſſing his ſorrow by an excellent ſpeech which
he made on the ſcaffold. Some perſons have thought that theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations

Soldiers of the Guard. He had ſent to the Duke the height of the
Walls, and had introduced ſome Officers, and made a Mine in his
Cellar to let in Soldiers into the City who were to ſurprize the
Guard: he was beheaded with three of his Companions. They
who ſaw them executed, related a ſtrange and incredible accident,
which was, that one of the heads which was cut off, made a leap on
the Scaffold, and fell on the ground, from whence it leaped upon a
perſon there preſent, and ſo faſtned its teeth in his Cloak, that it
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50836:68"/>

               <p>On the firſt of <hi>March</hi> 1584.<note place="margin">1584.</note> on Sunday about noon, the skie being
very clear,<note place="margin">March 1.</note> there was felt on a ſudden a great Earthquake, which
laſted ten or twelve minutes,<note place="margin">An Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.</note> and ſhewed it ſelf not only by the clat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of the Windows, Tiles, and Pent-houſes; but ſhaking the very
foundations of the Houſes, throwing down ſeveral Chimneys; it
ſhattered the Houſes about the Lake, and waxed greater three days
following, producing at length this unheard of diſaſter. Half a
League diſtant from the City of <hi>Aigle</hi> in the Canton of <hi>Berne</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
nine and ten in the Morning, there was ſeen a prodigious quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Earth driven out by the exhalations of a Rock, which divided
it ſelf into two parts, which poured down like a ſhowre of rain,
and overwhelmed in an inſtant the Valleys and neighbouring Plains.
The Hamlet of <hi>Corbery</hi> was all of it immediately buried ſave one
houſe, the Maſter of which aſtoniſhed at the ſtrange clatter he heard,
told his Wife, <hi>he believed the end of the World was at hand.</hi> They fell
to their prayers, and in the mean time the Earth paſſed like a wave
over their houſe without hurting any body but the Maſter, who was
ſlightly bruiſed in the head by a ſplinter. There was found in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
houſe a Child ſafe in the Cradle, and the Mother of it killed by
the ruins of the houſe, lying with her arms ſtretched over it; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
the Earth augmenting, as it rowled like a Snow-ball, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
in the Village of <hi>Yvorne</hi> ſixty nine Houſes, one hundred ſix
Barns full of Corn, a hundred perſons, and a great quantity of
Cattel: This Village being one of the beſt in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> inhabited
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50836:69"/>
by Farmers, who maintained themſelves by their labour, moſt part
of the men were out at work and ſo eſcaped, there was no houſe out of
which ſome one or other was not ſaved. The Earth was mixed with
a kind of hail ſtones, and with a cloud of ſparks and ſmoak, which
ſpread a ſmell of Brimſtone thereabouts. The ſhowre of Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as wonderful as thoſe of the Ancients have been ſuſpicious, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
at leaſt a League in length, and about twelve Acres in breadth;
it was unequal in thickneſs, but the ſhalloweſt place was ten foot
deep. All the ground which it covered, was made ſo ſmooth, that
a man would have thought it to have been run over by a rowling
ſtone, there being not the leaſt appearance of any houſes.</p>
               <p>This Earthquake was moreover ſo violent, that near the Village
of <hi>Morteru,</hi> the Lake overflowed its uſual limits at leaſt a quarter of
a Mile, and at <hi>Ville-neuve</hi> at the head of the Lake there were found
Tuns of Wine ſtanding upright on their bottoms. Near the City
of <hi>Aigle,</hi> a piece of a Rock was unlooſned and ſtopped without doing
any harm in a cleft of a Mountain.</p>
               <p>In the Month of <hi>October</hi> in the ſame Year the City of <hi>Zurich,</hi>

               <p>If this Alliance was matter of rejoycing to the City, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap

A famine and ſcarcity of Proviſion befel them,<note place="margin">1586.</note> which laſted a

                  </note> The worſt of it was, That what was eaten did not

               <p>In the beginning of the Year 1588.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vita di</hi> Sixto V.</note> the Duke of <hi>Savoy, Charles
Emanuel,</hi> ſent an extraordinary Ambaſſador to <hi>Rome,</hi> under pretence
of paying his acknowledgment to the Pope:<note place="margin">The Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to aſſiſt the Duke againſt <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </note> but the real intent of
it was, To deſire his aſſiſtance againſt <hi>Geneva,</hi> reſolving to leave
no means untried whereby to become Maſter of it. The Pope
received the Ambaſſador with the greateſt ſigns of reſpect: but as
to the buſineſs of <hi>Geneva</hi> he would not concern himſelf with it,
whether he feared the charge would be too great, or that he thought
the enterprize too difficult. There was then at <hi>Rome</hi> a <hi>Genevois</hi>
named <hi>Francis Fabry,</hi> Son of <hi>Peter Fabry,</hi> of one of the chief Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
in <hi>Geneva,</hi> who was Biſhop <hi>de la Cave. Sixtus</hi> had ſome
conferences with him, which proved not ineffectual: for the Pope
anſwered, at length, the Ambaſſador, <hi>That if it were a War wherein
Religion was concerned, it were then fitting he ſhould be intereſted in it,
as being head of the Church: but if it was a War which concerned the
State, he could not in Conſcience employ the Churches Treaſure in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:50836:69"/>
The Duke was not a little diſpleaſed at this anſwer, and being
of a cholerick temper, he could not forbear ſaying in a paſſion,
<hi>That</hi> Sixtus <hi>had rather ſhed the blood of Catholicks at</hi> Rome, <hi>than
that of Hereticks at</hi> Geneva.<note place="margin">1588.</note> At the ſame time he wrote to his
Ambaſſador to return home: <hi>And that if he could not ſubdue the</hi>
Genevoiſes <hi>by the help of the Spiritual Sword, he would try what
he could by the Temporal one, which no Prieſt was able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</hi>

                  <hi>his Highneſſes intereſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
his Ambaſſador in this following manner, after he had in
vain endeavoured the ſame thing:</hi> Alas, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I know very well
the temper of the Eccleſiaſticks of this Court, and eſpecially of this
Pope whom I have often dealt with. His Highneſs ought not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
any thing from him towards the War with <hi>Geneva.</hi> For ſhould
be take the City, he would keep it himſelf. Wherefore I believe it
would be better to let that City alone: for theſe Hereticks reſpect the
Duke, and bring him profit by trading with his Subjects: whereas if
it ſhould fall into the hands of the Eccleſiaſticks, they would not fail
to trouble the Duke and Neighbouring Princes. So that the Dukes
Subjects would be loſers by it, and would find ſuch a Neighbourhood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie
to them.</p>
               <p>The Duke taking advantage of the diſorders which the League
occaſioned in <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1588.</note> had ſeized on the Marquiſdom of <hi>Saluces;</hi>
at which the <hi>French</hi>-King, <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, requiring ſatisfaction,
ſent <hi>Nicholas Harlay Sieur</hi> of <hi>Sancy</hi> to the <hi>Genevoiſes,</hi> to ſtir them
up to make War againſt the Duke,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sancy</hi> ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> againſt the Duke.</note> knowing well the differences
betwixt them. <hi>Sancy</hi> promiſed on the Kings part, to ſend them
Men, and to bear all the charges of the War, and to let them
hold whatſoever they ſhould take from him. The Council was
divided about the matter, ſome alledged, That <hi>Henry</hi> might die,
and his Succeſſors forget the kindneſs received from them. That
the Duke would be ſure to remember it, and be revenged when
he was able. That War was hazardous, and that the City was
not in a capacity to hold out long in caſe it ſhould he beſieged.
Others on the contrary repreſented, That in obliging a great King
they might thereby procure an able Friend in their time of need;
that the Duke had declared himſelf an open Enemy; that the <hi>French</hi>-Churches
would be more kindly uſed upon this account; and that
the Prince Palatine, and the <hi>Switzers</hi> would furniſh them with
mony ſufficient to carry on this deſign. This laſt advice was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and afterwards <hi>Sancy</hi> went to ſtir up the <hi>Switzers,</hi> whom
he promiſed that the Duke ſhould be attached on the other ſide
from <hi>Dauphiny.</hi> The Prince perceiving this tempeſt which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him, would have made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Lauſane</hi> and the
Country of <hi>Vaud,</hi> under the conduct of the Baron of <hi>Hermance,</hi>
whoſe Troops lay about <hi>Thonon</hi> and <hi>Ripaille.</hi> The <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Dukes deſign on their Country, were eaſily won to
enter into a War with him.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> edged forward by <hi>Sancy</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſet out from the City, with ſix Companies of Foot, and three
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50836:70"/>
Troops of Horſe, in the Evening, under the command of the Sieur
<hi>Quitry</hi> a <hi>French</hi>-Gentleman, and a Knight of the Order who was
ſent to them, together with the Sieur of <hi>Baujeu,</hi> by the <hi>French</hi>-King
for to command their Forces, who in the ſame Night ſeized
on the Caſtle of <hi>Monthoux,</hi> having forced open the Gate, with a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard.</hi>
In the Morning they took the Town of <hi>Bonne,</hi> with its Caſtle
ſtanding at the entrance of <hi>Focigny.</hi> And from thence marched along

                  </note> where they broke down the Bridges of <hi>Tremblieres</hi>
and <hi>Buringe</hi> to hinder the Enemies paſſage. They preſented themſelves
before the Caſtle of S. <hi>Joire</hi> a place of ſtrength, and the Key of the
Baillage of <hi>Chablais,</hi> with a deſign to win it, not only for the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the place, but likewiſe to find Letters and Commiſſions
concerning the enterpriſes on the States of <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> of
which the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Hermance,</hi> the Lord of this Caſtle had been
the principal promoter. The Caſtle being taken, theſe ſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
were found in it, and great ſtore of Arms and Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
beſides. They returned, having left a Gariſon in this place,
without the loſs of a Man, becauſe that the Duke ſeeing neither
<hi>Switzers</hi> nor <hi>Griſons</hi> in the Field,<note place="margin">1589.</note> did not imagine the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi>
had dared to brave it thus in his Dominions. But the Country
ſounding an Alarm, he ſent away ſeveral Troops from <hi>Remilly</hi> to
obſerve the Enemies motion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Genevoiſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">April 7.</note> animated by this ſucceſs, marched out the next
Night after their return, to beſiege <hi>Gex,</hi> and in the Morning made
their approaches to it. But the beſieged pretended to capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late:
yet after ſeveral meſſages from both ſides, this Treaty proved
ineffectual, ſo that the Soldiers in the Caſtle began wholly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend

and two or three killed.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gex</hi> ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</note> Yet at length, foreſeeing their ruin
if they held out till the Cannon played, they ſurrendred it up,
and received a Gariſon that Night. The next Morning <hi>Claudius
Pobel</hi> Baron of <hi>Peter,</hi> and Governor of <hi>Gex,</hi> rendred himſelf to
<hi>Quitry</hi> at his diſcretion, who made him Priſoner of War, together
with two Captains, an Enſign and eighty Soldiers, who were all
<hi>Piedmontoiſes,</hi> and were carried away the ſame Night to <hi>Geneva.</hi>
Theſe laſt were all ſoon releaſed, except thoſe who would again
take part with their Enemies. But the Baron had his lodgings aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned

               <p>The Duke having notice of this ſiege, ſent away <hi>Sonas</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of <hi>Remilly</hi> to ſuccour the place. He ſet forth with eight Troops
of Horſe, and nine Companies of Foot: but hearing of its ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
he came and preſented himſelf before <hi>Bonne,</hi> having firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
the Bridge at <hi>Buringe.</hi> There were not above ninety Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in this Town; and ſome Peaſants who were ſent thither to
work on its Fortifications: one Captain <hi>Bois</hi> was left Governor of
the place. <hi>Sonas</hi> perceiving they were prepared to receive him,
turned aſide to ſeek other more favourable occaſions.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> had made an attempt on <hi>la

                  <note place="margin">La <hi>Cluſe</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by the <hi>Genevoiſes.</hi>
                  </note> which is a Fort made out of the hollow of a Rock of
Mount <hi>Jura,</hi> and bounded by the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> which ſlides along at its
foot. They fixed their Petards againſt the Gates; but taking wet,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50836:70"/>
they had no effect. <hi>Quitry</hi> marched thither after the taking of
<hi>Gex.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1589.</note> He met at <hi>Cologne</hi> with ſome Soldiers belonging to <hi>la Cluſe,</hi>
whom he, with twenty nine Men, beat back to their Trenches and
brought up the Cannon; which played in the Morning, but being
ill placed and ordered, it could do no execution. They of <hi>la Cluſe</hi>
had poſted ſome Muſqueteers on the Mountain, to hinder all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
to the Fort. <hi>Quitry</hi> ſent the Sieur of <hi>Ville-Neufe</hi> with a
Party of Foot to beat them off. He immediately ſet upon them
ſo vigorouſly that he routed them. There were ſeveral killed with the
Muſquet-ſhot, and others precipitated from the Rock. He came
down thence from the other ſide of the Mountain, and went and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
himſelf in the Village of <hi>Longerray</hi> in the way to <hi>Lyons,</hi> to the end
he might the ſooner end the ſiege: but beſides that he had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits
ſent him, the moſt part of the Soldiers being tired with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
in great numbers; and there remained with him but a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Men, who being charged by <hi>Sonas,</hi> at the head of 300 freſh
Soldiers, were forced to retire.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide,<note place="margin">1589.</note> the <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> and <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> endeavoured to
take the Fort by aſſault, reſolutely attempting it, although there was
no conſiderable breach made: the latter of theſe loſt ſeveral good
Soldiers, and amongſt others the Baron of S. <hi>Lagier,</hi> whoſe loſs

               <p>

                  <note place="margin">April 12.</note> where were arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſeveral Companies from <hi>Berne,</hi> under the conduct of Colonel
<hi>Erlach,</hi> having called a Council of War there, it was determined
to leave the ſiege of <hi>la Cluſe,</hi> ſeeing their attempts upon it had been
all this while ineffectual, and to go joyn with the Forces which
came from <hi>Soleurre</hi> and <hi>Griſons,</hi> to conſult together what was far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expedient.</p>
               <p>So the Army returned in good order to <hi>Geneva,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">April 16.</note> expecting the
promiſed recruits; which being come, they marched on the ſide
of <hi>Thonon,</hi> which is a little City ſeated near the <hi>Lake,</hi> having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Walls nor Ditches, but a good Caſtle ſtanding on the higheſt
part of the Town. The Cannon was brought by Water, to avoid
the difficulties of the way, and was three days before it came, by
reaſon the Wind was contrary: the Enemies in the mean time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
on the top of <hi>Pinchat,</hi> which is a riſing ground about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a League from <hi>Geneva.</hi> They were beat back and came and
forraged the <hi>Bailywick</hi> of <hi>Terny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt the Caſtle of <hi>Thonon</hi> was beſieged, that of <hi>Baleyſon,</hi> and
the other of <hi>Yvoire,</hi> were taken, together with the Tower in the
Village of <hi>Conciſe.</hi> There were not above ſeventeen or eighteen
Soldiers in this Tower, who held out ſome hours againſt <hi>Erlach</hi>'s
Regiment. The Colonel having ſet fire on the neighbouring
Houſes, they ſurrendred themſelves, and five of the chief of them
were hanged for their raſhneſs. The Sieur of <hi>Dingy</hi> who was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of the Caſtle of <hi>Thonon</hi> capitulated, and was permitted to
depart with eighty Soldiers, their Swords and Daggers hanging

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50836:71"/>
not lighted, nor Drums beating, nor Colours flying.</p>
               <p>The next Morning the Hoſpital of the Fort of <hi>Ripaille</hi> began to
be built,<note place="margin">April 27.</note> the Wood having been gained by the <hi>Lancers:</hi> ſome of the
out parts of it were taken; but the Fort had a good Trench, and
was very well fortified with a thick Wall, and ſeven Towers ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the midſt of it, whence the beſieged might eaſily kill the
choiceſt Soldiers in the Army: moreover they relied on the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
the Duke had promiſed them. In effect he came the next
Morning within two Leagues of <hi>Thonon,</hi> with 1500 <hi>Lancers,</hi> 1000
Foot, and 500 <hi>Argoulets,</hi> commanded by the Earl of <hi>Martinengue</hi>
and <hi>de Sonas.</hi> Theſe <hi>Argoulets</hi> were a kind of light horſemen, much

and a Carbine, which hath ſince occaſioned their being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Carbineers.</hi> The <hi>Lancers</hi> were another kind of Cavalry, armed

               <p>

motion:<note place="margin">The Royal Army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of 10000 Foot and three Troops of Horſe.</note> but not agreeing, they did nothing, although the Enemy

ſome Horſe of the Retinue of the two Commanders.</p>
               <p>Two days after, <hi>Quitry</hi> having poſted the three <hi>Geneva</hi> Cornets
on a riſing plain,<note place="margin">1589.</note> called <hi>Creſte,</hi> near <hi>Thonon,</hi> they ranged themſelves
into the form of a Hedge,<note place="margin">April 29.</note> expecting till they ſhould be ſheltred by
ſome Muſqueteers or Pikes: but they not coming in, and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
having diſcovered them, came and attacked them with three
or 400 <hi>Lancers;</hi> who finding the Match unequal, drew back with
full ſpeed to <hi>Thonon.</hi> They were purſued as far as the Bars by the
Enemy, who loſt the Baron of <hi>Vitry.</hi> After this the Cornets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to their Poſt, and with ſome Foot, drawn out in haſte, made
the Enemy give ground; but they being reinforced by a body of
<hi>Lancers,</hi> beat them back the ſecond time as far as <hi>Thonon.</hi> Puffed

compelled the Enemies to retire with ſome loſs, and the Earl of
<hi>Martenengue</hi> their General was wounded in the Leg, not having been
able to put in ſuccours into <hi>Ripaille.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe skirmiſhes did them a kindneſs: for the <hi>Switzers</hi> finding

Forces, reſolved thereupon to forſake thoſe quarters, and to paſs
over into <hi>Franche-Comté.</hi> The building of <hi>Ripaille</hi> was continued,
but they within it, perceiving no ſuccours coming, rendred upon

of this Army put the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> to a great deal of trouble, who ſaw
themſelves by this means burthened with the charge of the War,
their Treaſure, Proviſion and Ammunition being almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted.</p>
               <p>In effect the Duke made greater Levies, and was reſolved to have
his revenge. The Baron of <hi>Hermance</hi> began with <hi>Focigny,</hi> and took
the Caſtle of <hi>Boege,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Boege</hi> taken.</note> in which there were not above eighteen Soldiers,
who after they had a while ſtoutly defended themſelves, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to depart with their Matches lighted, and retired to <hi>Bonne.</hi>
The Caſtle of S. <hi>Joire</hi> in which there were not above 30. Soldiers with
a Serjeant was taken likewiſe, who was very much blamed for leaving
ſo ſoon ſo tenable a place, having held out but two daies; but he was
killed a while after in a skirmiſh, and the remembrance of his fault
was buried together with him. The Baron holding on his career ſat
down before <hi>Marcouſſey,</hi> giving the Captain who commanded there a
ſummons: he returned him an anſwer with Muſquet ſhot, and made a
Sally out wherein ſeveral of the Enemy were killed. The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there ſet out from <hi>Geneva</hi> about three hundred Soldiers, with the
Garriſon of <hi>Bonne,</hi> to its aſſiſtance, which the Enemy underſtanding
withdrew in haſte.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Duke advanced with his Vaunt-guard of one
thouſand five hundred Foot,<note place="margin">May 25.</note> and five hundred Horſe to attack the
Fort which the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> had begun to raiſe near the Bridge of <hi>Arve.</hi>

There was a Sally made out upon them, and they were conſtrained
to give back in diſorder with the Petards and Ladders which they had
made ready, the City not loſing a man; they took one of <hi>Sonas</hi>'s

ſome proviſion left there; they did the ſame to ſeveral other places
of ſmall importance, reſerving only <hi>Bonne</hi> and <hi>Monthoux.</hi> The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

Bailliage of <hi>Terny.</hi> The Duke himſelf came in perſon with two
great Cannons and four Field-pieces before the Caſtle of <hi>Terny,</hi> which
was but an ancient Tower without any fence, only encloſed with a
thick Wall. The beſieged having refuſed to render after Summons,
the aſſault began,<note place="margin">

wounded the Lieutenant who commanded in the Captains abſence,
the beſieged ſurrendred upon promiſe of their lives; yet they were

thoſe about him ſet before him the ill conſequence of it.</p>
               <p>There was ſome daies after a skirmiſh near the Fort of <hi>Arve,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">June 3.</note>
where his Highneſs was worſted, although his Army conſiſted of
eight thouſand men; the Baron of <hi>Breſſiac,</hi> who commanded a

Party of the Regiment of <hi>Maurevel</hi> was taken. There was on the

                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Genevoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> engage the Enemy.</note> a very remarkable encounter on the plain of <hi>Oüattes.</hi>
Half a League from this Fort five hundred Muſqueteers having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the Enemy, went out with a deſign to attack them, but they
had immediately three thouſand Foot and a thouſand Horſe to deal
with, yet did they reſolutely fight them for four hours together, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
200. of them, beſides ſeveral Captains and perſons of quality

the beſt Soldiers in the Army; he had raſhly ſworn to enter that day
into the Fort, and ſo he did, being carried in dead, after the ſame
manner as another <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Earl. Strange it is that the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi>
ſhould loſe on their ſide but two men, and only four or five wounded.
There was ſolemn thanks returned to God in all the Churches for
this Succeſs, and from that time the Enemy fearing this ſmall hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of men, who had given them ſuch ſharp entertainment, barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoed

they called S. <hi>Katherines</hi> Fort by the name of the Dutcheſs.</p>
               <p>The Duke having notice that one part of the Army from <hi>Berne,</hi>
which was ſent to the aſſiſtance of <hi>Geneva,</hi> was advanced within a

               <p>The Dukes affairs were little better in <hi>Focigny,</hi> his Troops were
recruited by a Party of the <hi>Breſſans,</hi> and came and quartered in the

to leave that poſt, where they would have made an effort to block up
<hi>Bonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Army of <hi>Berne,</hi> which approached, conſiſting of forty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
and commanded by the Advoyer of <hi>Vatteville,</hi> put the Duke
upon other reſolves. He concluded by the advice of his Council,
that it were beſt to ſet upon the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> before the arrival of this
Army, and to waſte the Bailliage of <hi>Terny,</hi> and endeavour to draw
them into an ambuſh. There being ſome propoſals afterwards made
by ſome of his Highneſſes Council, and the Lords of <hi>Berne,</hi> in order
to a peace, the Duke finding himſelf ſtrong enough, demanded
reſtitution of the Bailliages which had been lately taken from him,
as likewiſe the Bailliage of the Country of <hi>Vaud</hi> as far as the gates of
<hi>Berne,</hi> and required ten Millions for the charge of the War; but the
<hi>Bernoiſes</hi> gave him to underſtand, that they were able to make him
more moderate in his pretenſions. The reſt of this Month was ſpent
in ſeveral encounters near the Fort of <hi>Arve</hi> and <hi>Bonne,</hi> which the
Earl of <hi>Maurevel</hi> would have taken one morning by ſurprize with
his Regiment,<note place="margin">June 28.</note> and Troops from <hi>Focigny.</hi> The Garriſon conſiſted of
not above one hundred and fifty men, and they believing that they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50836:72"/>
were already ſure of the place, called out to them in raillery, <hi>That
they ſhould make ready their Dinner,</hi> but they were feaſted with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <p>In all theſe rencounters and ſome others that followed,<note place="margin">July 14.</note> the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiſes</hi>

                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> agree upon a ceſſatlon of Arms.</note> becauſe they had agreed
with the Duke upon a ceſſation of Arms which held three weeks,
which being expired, they paſſed by <hi>Geneva,</hi> and battered down the
Bridge of <hi>Buringe,</hi> and came before the Caſtle of S. <hi>Joire,</hi> having
the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> for their vauntguard. They took ſeveral Forts, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacked

               <p>The death of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, which hapned about this time, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> with great hopes, eſpecially conſidering his

                     <hi>Mercier</hi> the Miniſter flead alive.</note> but in coming out they were encloſed by the Horſe, and

which was done two years after in <hi>Bonne.</hi> Some counſelled his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to proſecute his Victory, and to ſeize upon part of the <hi>Bernoiſes</hi>
Country, whom he had quelled; but he choſe rather to come to an
agreement with them, that he might afterwards go into <hi>Provence:</hi>
He endeavoured likewiſe to get the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> to make him ſome
offers of ſubmiſſion, but they would not yield to it; ſo that to keep
them in, he erected a Fort called S. <hi>Maurice</hi> at <hi>Verſoy</hi> and raiſed a plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
on the ſide of the Lake, for to batter with his Cannon the Barks,
which ſhould venture,<note place="margin">Octob.</note> to ſet out from <hi>Geneva;</hi> he left the Baron of

               <p>The <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> having this thorn in their foot, called a Council,
wherein it was reſolved to obtain this Fort at any rate; having ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
then all their Forces, <hi>viz.</hi> 800. Foot, two Troops of Horſe,
two Troops of Argoulets of Light-Horſmen, and 150. Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers,
under the Command of the <hi>Sieur Lubigny,</hi> whom the King had
ſent them, they ſet out about ten of the Clock at night, after they
had been at publick Prayer, being furniſhed with <hi>Petards</hi> and ſcaling
Ladders.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſoy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged and taken.</note> The Garriſon of <hi>Verſoy</hi> who had been harraſed all day on

being arrived at two of the Clock in the morning before <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoy,</hi>
divided themſelves into four Companies. The Horſe made a
halt, and the body of Foot went to the Gate which looks directly to
<hi>Copet</hi> to ſet the Petard, againſt it. The other party climbed up the
Walls, and ſeventeen of the reſoluteſt of them followed a Peaſant
who was their guide, with iron barrs on their ſhoulders; he led them
between the Lake and the Borough, to a paſſage where there was a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50836:73"/>
private entry into the place. The neareſt Sentinel gave the alarm
to the <hi>Corps du Guard,</hi> but theſe ſeventeen Soldiers not giving them
time to bethink themſelves, knocked down ſeveral of them with
their Partiſans and Cutlaces. Some Captains being awaked would
have put themſelves into a poſture of defence, but they were ſoon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched;
the Baron endeavouring to rally the reſt, ſaw himſelf at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked
by thoſe who had broken open the Gate, and ſcaled the Walls.
All that he could do before it was day, was to retire in haſte with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two hundred Soldiers into the Caſtle, having left in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
near two hundred of his men dead on the place.<note place="margin">Nov. 8.</note> This ſame
Baron, who had often threatned the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> to force them by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
to come with halters about their necks to cry the Duke mercy,
found himſelf then not a little in trouble, being deſtitute of both
Wine and Water, and the moſt part of his Soldiers having nothing
but their Waſtecoats. Yet to divert the Aſſailants, and to give notice
to the neighbouring Garriſons to come and help him, he made his
Cannon thunder the next morning till night againſt the houſes of
<hi>Verſoy;</hi> having continued thus the day following to little purpoſe
againſt the beſiegers, and ſeeing no ſuccours coming, he came to
compoſition. They marched out with their Drums on their back,
their Matches put out, and their Colours rolled up, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
as far as <hi>Gex;</hi> great ſtore of Ammunition which was found
there was carried to <hi>Geneva.</hi> Sixty <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Slaves who had wrought

               <p>On the firſt day of the following Year,<note place="margin">Jan. 2.</note> a party of Horſe from

were vigorouſly repelled; but twelve days after they returned again,
bringing along with them their Cannon. The Garriſon ſurrendring,
the place was demoliſhed. Some days after the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> ſurprized

                     <hi>Gex</hi> ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</note> and ſo ſtraitly beleaguer'd the Caſtle, that it was
ſurrendred the next morning.<note place="margin">Jan. 18.</note> The Caſtle, of <hi>Monthoux</hi> which was
full of reſolute perſons, ſworn Enemies to <hi>Geneva,</hi> was forced to yield,

on their ſide attacked the Fort of <hi>Arve,</hi> from which they were twice
beat off.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Genevoiſes,</hi> after the taking of <hi>Gex</hi> and ſome other ſmall
places, reſolved to attack the Caſtle of <hi>Pierre,</hi> which had often
moleſted them. <hi>Lurbigny</hi> then marching out with ſome Troops,
there were 50 <hi>Argoulets</hi> or light-horſemen,<note place="margin">April 16.</note> who ſet upon the firſt,
and met about 30 <hi>Harquebuzieres</hi> or Carbineers, belonging to <hi>La
Cluſe,</hi> near the Village of <hi>Farges:</hi> they had taken away the Bell of
the Church, which they paid dearly for: for the light-horſe ſet
upon them ſo fiercely that ſcarcely four of them eſcaped, the
<hi>Genevoiſes</hi> having only one of their Serjeants wounded. <hi>D'Arſene,</hi>
who was Governor of the Caſtle of <hi>Pierre,</hi> pretended he would
come to their aſſiſtance; but ſeeing the Troops come upon him
ſo faſt, he ſhut himſelf up, and ſurrendred two days after, without
offering any great reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Lurbigny</hi> laying hold of this opportunity, determined to try what
he could do on <hi>la Cluſe.</hi> He diſpatched away for this purpoſe three
Companies to the other ſide of the Fort to block up the paſſages.
He placed, at the ſame time, People on the Mountains to roll
thence great Stones on the beſieged, cauſing the Cannon to play
from his ſide, which beat down the murthering Pieces, and the
Cloiſter of <hi>Ravelin,</hi> which lay before the Fort. This <hi>Ravelin</hi>
was won three days after notwithſtanding the vigorous reſiſtance
of the beſieged, and the frequent ſhot from the Fort of <hi>Wache</hi> on
the other ſide the <hi>Rhoſne.</hi> The next Morning the Aſſailants ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves at the foot of the Fort, they plied the beſieged with
Petards, Mines, and Granadoes. Moreover, there was thrown
down into the Fort lighted Straw, which almoſt choaked the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
with ſmoke. Their fellows from <hi>Wache</hi> encouraged them,
telling them their relief was approaching; as indeed it was. The
Troops from <hi>Savoy</hi> gave notice of their coming to their relief

his Men in good heart, and reſolved to carry away the place,
more vigorouſly continued his Mines; ſo that the beſieged ſeeing
themſelves in this extremity, and upon the point of being taken
by main force, capitulated, promiſing to leave the place if they
were not relieved before ſuch an hour the next day, which was
conſented to. The Troops from <hi>Savoy</hi> being tired, and having
reſted that Night at <hi>Chatillon,</hi> came not within the time. <hi>Lurbig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
uſed a ſtratagem, to the end the beſiged might not hear the
hollowings and ſhouts of Joy, which they of the Fort of <hi>Wache</hi>
made, ſeeing the ſuccours approach; for he cauſed the Drums to
beat, and the Trumpets to ſound continually near the Fort: ſo that
the Captain, a <hi>Piedmontois,</hi> who commanded it, marched out with
28 Soldiers,<note place="margin">April 21.</note> being all that were left; and at the ſame time <hi>Lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigny</hi>
entred into the Fort. The <hi>Savoyards</hi> coming near, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
the place ſtill belonged to them, called the Captain by his
name, and were much amazed to be anſwered with Muſquet-ſhot.
Yet after ſome skirmiſhes, <hi>Dom Amedée</hi> Baſtard of <hi>Savoy,</hi> having
ſeized on an advantagious Poſt on the neighbouring Mountain,
through the cowardiſe of Captain <hi>Eſgaillon</hi> who was left there,
<hi>Lurbigny</hi> ſaw plainly he could not hold <hi>la Cluſe</hi> againſt a whole
Army and in an Enemies Country, which cauſed him to leave it,
having blown up part of it. He brought back his Troops to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi>
and at the ſame time the Enemy made a furious ſpoil in all
the Bailiwich of <hi>Gex,</hi> and put the Fort again in a poſture of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
<hi>Eſgaillon</hi> was afterwards ſentenced by the Council of 200

ſo ſoon, but that the <hi>Savoyards</hi> had already ſeized on a Bark, and
began to divide the ſpoil, having for their greater ſecurity planted
30 Muſqueteers on the ſhoar. But ſeeing People from all parts
coming in upon them, they let go their Prize, and were contented
to carry away only ſome Cheeſes and other Proviſions to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue

they could not be purſued; there were only two of them kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

               <p>There ſeldom paſſed a Week without ſome act of Hoſtility on

rallied again by the valorous Conduct of two of theſe Horſmen,

<hi>Gex,</hi> and had driven away 300 head of Cattle: an hour after ſome
Horſe and Foot purſued them, being 400 Foot-men, and 150
Lancers. The light-horſemen of <hi>Geneva</hi> frequently skirmiſhed
with them as they retired, <hi>Lurbigny</hi> not intending to hazard a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
with them. The <hi>Savoyards</hi> finding it difficult to carry off
their prey, there being ſeveral of the hindermoſt of their company
already ſlain,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lurbigny</hi> defeats the <hi>Savoyards.</hi>
                  </note> left their Booty and kept cloſe together. <hi>Lurbigny</hi>
taking good notice of them, and judging them to be weary,
gave the Lancers a rough charge: who amazed at ſo fierce an on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
and ſeeing ſeveral overthrown, fled, having good Horſes and
better Spurs, leaving their Foot behind, who finding themſelves
no longer guarded, endeavoured to get on the ſide of <hi>la Cluſe:</hi>
but being hemmed in by <hi>Lurbigny,</hi> he gave them ſuch a fierce charge,
that in the Village of <hi>Farges,</hi> or thereabouts, there remained 120
dead on the place, both <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> and the reſt were
put to flight. The <hi>Geneva</hi> Troops, wearied and almoſt ſpent with
heat, having performed all this, faſting from five of the Clock in
the Morning, returned back into the City towards ſix of the Clock
in the Evening, bringing along with them three Drums, two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and great quantity of Arms, and five Priſoners. <hi>Lurbigny</hi>
loſt but one Man: but he being hot in purſuit, and coming in to
the reſcue of one of his Troopers who had advanced too far, he
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50836:74"/>
got a fall off his Horſe, and being a corpulent Man, he bruiſed
his Body in ſeveral places, which cauſed him a great while to keep
his Bed.</p>
               <p>Two days after <hi>Dom Amedée,</hi> the Duke his Brother's Lieutenant,
ſent a Drummer to <hi>Geneva,</hi> to know the number of the Priſoners,
ſaying, That he found his Army diminiſhed by 400 Men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
he was too rudely dealt withal, they having not ſo much
as ſpared his Drummers. Anſwer was made him, That they
were found, as the others, with their Arms in their hands: ſetting
before him the cruelty which his Troops had exerciſed in all the
Villages, where they had made War againſt the weakeſt of their
Subjects, ſetting upon old Men, Women, and Children, who were
not able to reſiſt them. They hindred him not from doing yet
worſe in all the Country of <hi>Gex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another time, when the Light-horſe and Cavalry made a ſally
out of <hi>Geneva,</hi> the Enemy made himſelf amends for his former
diſgrace. They were gone with a Company of Foot, and ſome
Volunteers, on the ſide of the Fort of <hi>Wache</hi> to Forrage the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
Half a League diſtant from <hi>Vourban</hi> they ſpied 120 Lancers,
who were ſtrengthened by four diviſions of Foot. One of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains
of the Horſe would not tarry till they were advanced near
them, but cauſed the Trumpets to ſound, ſo that the Light-horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
began to run in upon them a full gallop, and overthrew
them, having likewiſe put the Lancers to flight. But inſtead of
proſecuting the Victory, this Captain who had been too haſty in
ſounding the Charge, was as haſty in ſounding the Retreat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
affrighted at ſome ſhouting which he heard afar off, which he
thought was an Army making up to them. Having then ſeveral
times cried out, <hi>Let us turn back;</hi> theſe words being reiterated, ſo
greatly diſmaied his Party, that they began to retreat diſorderly.
The Lancers perceiving that they began to turn backs, rallied
themſelves and purſued the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> for two Leagues together,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> worſted.</note>
as far as <hi>Bernay,</hi> ſlew twenty of them, and carried away forty of
them Priſoners to <hi>Wache.</hi> It is certain that this defeat had been
greater, had they purſued but half a League further theſe <hi>Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways,</hi>
who were ſtupefied with ſhame and a panick fear. There
were endeavours made to wipe off this diſgrace by ſeveral inroads
into <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The abſence of the Sieur <hi>Lurbigny,</hi> who ſtill kept his Bed, was
partly the occaſion of this rout, and of another more to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which hapned awhile after: for the Soldiers wanting an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
Captain,<note place="margin">1590.</note> and one whom they might reſpect, obſerved
no order.<note place="margin">July 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Dom Amedée</hi> coming into the Country of <hi>Gex,</hi> with
500 Horſe, and 1500 Foot, placed a Guard in ſeveral Villages a
League diſtant from <hi>Geneva.</hi> The next Morning he laid an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh
near <hi>Bouchet</hi> and <hi>Chatelaine</hi> of ſeveral Squadrons of Horſe and
Companies of Foot,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Amedée</hi> ſays Ambuſhes about <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </note> leaving the Plain which lay betwixt theſe
two Villages at liberty. A Company of Foot, coming out of the
Town by break of day, had been incloſed by them, but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
themſelves, by means of the Hedges and Ditches, got
off. <hi>Dom Amedée,</hi> deſirous of drawing a greater number of the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50836:75"/>
                  <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> into theſe Ambuſcades, commanded a Party of Horſe
to drive away openly ſeveral Herds of Cattel, and to kill ſome
Peaſants: An alarm being given to the City thereupon, both Horſe
and Foot croud out of it in throngs, half armed, and without any
Leader, to the aſſiſtance of their Companions, who diſcovering no
Body in the Plain between <hi>Chatelaine</hi> and <hi>Bouchet,</hi> kept on their way
to the end, not minding how they ſhould return, and in an inſtant
ſaw themſelves ſurrounded by the <hi>Savoy</hi>-horſe, attended by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Companies of Foot who thundered upon them. This skirmiſh
was exceeding ſharp,<note place="margin">The <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> defeated.</note> and laſted almoſt an hour: at length the
<hi>Geneva</hi>-horſe finding themſelves weakened, and unable to hold out,
began to give back; and ſo did the Foot, when the Enemies ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
diſordered them, wholly defeated them. An hundred Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
and Inhabitants lay dead on the place, and as many Peaſants
who bore Arms. They who could reach the Town, died for the
moſt part of their wounds, and eſpecially thoſe who were carried
to the Hoſpital, whoſe Phyſician inſtead of curing them poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their wounds. The villain ſome ſeventeen or eighteen Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
received the reward of his crimes. This defeat gave ſuch an
alarm to the City, that they within thought the Enemy was at
their Gates, as indeed he drew near, and was ſaluted by the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non:
But moreover in this encounter there was nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
there being neither Cannoneers nor Ammunition at
hand.</p>
               <p>They who have ſince conſidered this fatal day, have marvelled
that one of them who went out could return alive, ſo great was
the confuſion. Yet this Victory was dear bought by the Enemy,
at the beginning of the fight, ſo that he might ſay with <hi>Pyrrhus:
If we win another Battel, which coſts us as much as this, we are undone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Savoyards</hi> expected that at Night the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> would come
and carry away their dead, to the end they might make a new ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
but the preſent conſternation of the City, and the prudence
of <hi>Lurbigny,</hi> who notwithſtanding his ilneſs, ſtood without the
Gates in his Night-gown, to hinder any farther miſchief they were
kept back. The Company of Foot-Soldiers, who had been beſet
in the Morning, came off beſt, for they having couragiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
themſelves, returned at Night into the City, having loſt not
above eight or nine Soldiers.</p>
               <p>The arrival of the Sieur <hi>Clugny</hi> Baron of <hi>Conforgien,</hi> who was
an excellent Soldier,<note place="margin">Aug. 23.</note> gave them freſh hopes, being ſent to command
the <hi>Geneva</hi> Forces:<note place="margin">The Baron of <hi>Conforgien</hi> arrives at <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </note> for an hour after he had light of his Horſe,
three Companies were commanded to be in a readineſs in the
Evening, and to make their appearance before their Captains
Lodgings. They Embarked at nine of the Clock at Night, ſtear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their courſe towards <hi>Roolle,</hi> to paſs over immediately to the
ſhoar which lies over-againſt the little City of <hi>Evian,</hi> on which
they had a deſign. But thoſe of that City hearing of their coming,
ſtrengthened themſelves by an addition of five companies to their
Guard; which the other perceiving, hoiſted up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ail and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
without doing any thing. Yet the Frigats made ſome
courſes on the Lake, and brought home ſome booty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:50836:75"/>
Towards the midſt of <hi>September,</hi> the Enemy not appearing it was
thought they were retired: beſides that ſeveral Peaſants either over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous
or ſuborned for that purpoſe aſſured the Magiſtrates that
there was not in all <hi>Focigny,</hi> above three hundred Foot, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Horſe, upon which it was reſolved to forrage within half a
League from <hi>Bonne;</hi> But a ſpy carrying notice thereof to the Baron
of <hi>Hermance,</hi> he ſent to all the Garriſons, ſo that the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there came to him two hundred Horſe and five hundred Foot,
with which Forces he deſigned to incloſe the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> by an ambuſh,
when they were laden with ſpoil.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> were as little careful of their Enemies as if they
had been thirty Leagues off, and imagined their booty ſo eaſie to be
obtained, that although the Baron of <hi>Conforgien</hi> was ſo prudent to
give order to march out with their greateſt ſtrength, to defend
themſelves if need required, yet the greateſt part of them having
ſlept that Night at their eaſe, without thinking on their equipage,
could not get themſelves ready. So that the train of theſe Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagers
conſiſted only of 150 Foot, and 130 Horſe, who went out
with their Chariots and Tuns, about ſix or ſeven of the Clock in
the Morning, not dreaming of fighting, being accompanied with
ſeveral Peaſants,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hermance</hi> lays an Ambuſh for the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiſes</hi> gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Wine-harveſt</note> to gather the Vine-harveſt, which they imagined
would be done without the leaſt trouble. In the mean time came
the Baron of <hi>Hermance,</hi> whilſt they were buſie at work, through
bie-ways and beſet the paſſages, placing eighty Muſqueteers in a
Mill on the River of <hi>Menonge,</hi> poſting others on the Banks, and
the reſt in Ambuſhes, and ſo waited for them of <hi>Geneva,</hi> without
any noiſe, till Noon, about which time they were to return. Three
Squadrons of Lancers being diſcovered, with Foot-Soldiers in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places; notice hereof was given to the Baron of <hi>Conforgien,</hi>
who, without ſeeming aſtoniſhed at the matter, encouraged his
Soldiers, and ſaid Prayers himſelf; which done, obſerving the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
as near as he could, he ſent a Company on one ſide to begin
the attack, and on the other fifty ſtout reſolute fellows to gain
the Mill, thirty Horſe to relieve both Parties as need ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
and to get ſome advantagious ground, keeping with him
the greateſt number to help where there would be moſt need.
The fifty went reſolutely through the Muſquet-ſhot to the Mill,
killing and taking Priſoners as many as they found there. Whilſt
the Baron of <hi>Hermance</hi>'s Lancers making no reckoning of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Horſe, whom they imagined would be ſoon diſpatched, they
ſet upon a Company of Light-horſe: but they had no ſooner aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed
them, but that the foreſaid Party of thirty Horſe broke in
upon their Squadrons through their Flanks, and, aſſiſted by the
Light-horſe, put them to a rout.</p>
               <p>Another of the Enemies Squadrons having ſeen ten or twelve of
their Company ſlain by an Ambuſcade, began to fall back, and
was immediately ſet upon and overthrown by the Horſe, who
being aſſiſted by the Infantry, fell upon a great Body of the
Enemies Foot, who yielded after ſome reſiſtance, and the greateſt
part of them lay in the duſt. This combat laſted three hours, and
was one of the notableſt Victories the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> had ever yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50836:76"/>
The Baron of <hi>Conforgiens</hi> Horſe was killed under him, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
his buſineſs with a marvelous prudence and preſence of mind.
One of his Foot Captains likewiſe bravely ſignalized himſelf,<note place="margin">The Valour of a Captain.</note> and
having ſlain five of the Enemy with his Sword, he at length loſt its
guard, yet did he continue fighting with the Blade of it, with which
he ſtrook a Halbard out of a Serjeants hand, took him by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and ſtabb'd him; got a Horſe and a Sword from another whom
he purſued, and animated the reſt by his example. Although at firſt
there were ſeveral who had more mind to get away than to ſtand it
out and fight, yet the reſolution of ſome edged on the reſt, and the
preſent ſtrait made them all reſolute. The ſpie who had advertiſed the
Baron of <hi>Hermance,</hi> and a raſh Monk who bore a Mace, were found
lying amongſt the dead, with two Captains, beſides ſeveral Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
and Enſigns. In fine this was ſo general a defeat, that ſome
days after, ſeveral Horſemen riding out to number the dead, found
two hundred and ſixty two lying in the Field, and almoſt as many
amongſt the Vines and along the Banks; ſo that it was judged the
<hi>Savoyards</hi> loſt three hundred and fifty who were ſlain, and one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
who were taken Priſoners, beſides eighty who were wounded.
The Baron of <hi>Hermance</hi> having had almoſt all his Company of Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats
killed, ſaved himſelf on a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gennet. The booty was
very conſiderable, for the moſt of them were well clad, and ſeveral
Gentlemen had Velvet Coats or of rich ſtuffs laid in with rich gold
and ſilver, as if they were going to a wedding; ſo ſure were they (as
they imagined) of the Victory. It is reported they intended to put
all to the Sword, without troubling themſelves with taking any
Priſoners. The <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> loſt but ten Foot-men, and one Trooper,
and had but fifteen of their men wounded, who were all of them
curable. This Victory was owing to the Baron of <hi>Conforgiens</hi> pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
conduct, and the exact obedience of the Soldiers; ſo likewiſe
did he ſolemnly return thanks unto God in the midſt of his little Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
before he ſtirred out of the place. The reſt of the Month was
ſpent in making inroads into <hi>Savoy,</hi> and in the demoliſhing ſome
Caſtles.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of the following months the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> made a
very deſperate attempt.<note place="margin">Octob. 29.</note> In the evening all the Companies both Horſe
and Foot marched out through the new Gate, and paſſed over the
<hi>Arve,</hi> and took the Road which leads to <hi>Cruſille,</hi> a ſmall and weak
City about three Leagues diſtant from <hi>Geneva.</hi> There were in it
three Companies of <hi>Neapolitans, Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> great <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefeus,</hi>
and who had extreamly waſted and deſtroyed the Country
of <hi>Gex.</hi> The Peaſants perceiving theſe Forces making towards them,
alarm'd the whole Country; and the noiſe of this reached to <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſille</hi>
at one of the Clock at night. One part of the Garriſon made no
reckoning of it, but the wiſeſt of them went and kept watch about
the Walls, and ſome other betook themſelves to a Platform, fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with part of their Baggage. A little before day, the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached

ſounded a Charge, and offered to ſcale the City; the beſieged made
ſome reſiſtance, but confiding in the Caſtle and Platform, the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
withdrew thither; the City was ſacked, and the greateſt part of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50836:76"/>
it burnt; thoſe Soldiers who were found in the houſes, were all of
them put to the Sword: for the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> would not trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with Priſoners, the Priſons being already full, and they on their
ſide deſired no quarter. The Baron obſerving his men to be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
and laden with booty, and fearing leſt they ſhould be ſet upon
by the Enemy from the Caſtle, and perceiving likewiſe the whole
Country to be alarm'd, he ſounded a retreat, having ſtaid there ſix
hours, and having loſt but three Soldiers and a Lieutenant; the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
loſt on their ſide a hundred men. The Year was ended in the
performance of actions of ſmall importance, they of <hi>Geneva</hi> having
burnt the Villages of <hi>Thyole</hi> and <hi>Frangy. Sancy</hi> returned with freſh
Forces, and ſet on foot new deſigns.</p>
               <p>On New-years-day following,<note place="margin">1591.</note> the Caſtle of <hi>Buringe</hi> was beſieged
by the Kings Army, together with the Forces of <hi>Geneva;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jan. 1.</note> both of
which conſiſting of two thouſand men,<note place="margin">

purſuing ſome <hi>Geneva</hi> Curriers, came into the very quarters of
the Beſiegers, and had ſurprized a party of them, had they come
with leſs noiſe; ſome Light-Horſemen and <hi>Albanoiſes</hi> whom the
<hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador had ſent from <hi>Venice,</hi> got immediately on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
and with the help of ſome Foot fell upon the Lancers, overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in an inſtant their Captain <hi>Chriſtopher Guevara.</hi> The Lancers
fought on ſtill, but ſeeing ſixty of their men lying on the ground,
they drew back and retired in diſorder; the next morning the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
began a freſh more vehemently than before, and the beſieged
who had at firſt appeared very hot, deſired to come to compoſition:
but no other terms were admitted but to render themſelves at the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
diſcretion, being threatned with no quarter if they tarried
till the next aſſault. They perceiving that they could not obtain
what they deſired, got through a back door to the Bridge of <hi>Arve,</hi>
from which the Aſſailants could not hinder them; they eſcaped in
diſorder, and were purſued as far as <hi>Bonne.</hi> This hapned well for the
Soldiers, a great many of whom would without doubt have periſhed
had they given another aſſault to the place, the breach being a Pikes
length from the ground, and fortified with a <hi>Ravelin,</hi> and an inward
Wall and a Bulwark behind it. This Caſtle was demoliſhed, but
the Enemy built it again and made it tenable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thonon</hi> was likewiſe retaken by <hi>Quitry.</hi>

nothing but their plundering,<note place="margin">1591.</note> committed ſeveral outrages. The

to the value of ſix or ſeven thouſand Crowns of gold; the
ſame was done at <hi>Evian,</hi> they of the Caſtle whom the Sieur of <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villars</hi>

coming,<note place="margin">The Dukes Army ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</note> ſurrendered, their Arms and Jewels ſaved, the Country was

holding a Council, they were told that the Dukes Army was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at <hi>Roche</hi> conſiſting of ſix thouſand Foot, and four hundred Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
and five hundred Lancers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Olivarez</hi> an old and experienced Captain who commanded the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> in the Dukes Army, counſelled them not to advance, but
to watch the motions of the <hi>French</hi> for to take them upon an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
alledging that want of Proviſion would force them to retire,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50836:77"/>
or if they engaged farther into <hi>Savoy,</hi> their defeat would be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.
<hi>Dom Amedee</hi> liked well this Advice, but <hi>Sonas</hi> the Marquis of
<hi>Treffort,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Chateau Neuf,</hi> who had more heat than light
in his head, was of opinion they ſhould march forward without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
alledging there would redound more honour and advantage to
them in chaſtiſing the <hi>French,</hi> than in expecting till they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of their own accord. That <hi>Quitry</hi>'s Camp conſiſted moſt of
pillagers who were laden with ſpoil, and who for fear of loſing it,
would chuſe rather to uſe their feet than hands; and in ſhort, that
their own Army being ill paid would ſoon disband themſelves, if they
ſtood ſtill without fighting. This Counſel was taken, and the attack
was reſolved upon.</p>
               <p>The Sieurs of <hi>Sancy, Quitry</hi> and <hi>Conforgien,</hi> who were encamped at
<hi>Buringe,</hi> being advertiſed that this Army was coming to break in
upon them, took out immediately the Garriſons of <hi>Polinge</hi> and <hi>Viſery,</hi>
and fired theſe Caſtles, and ſent out Scouts to view the Enemy. They
had an account by ſome Priſoners, but leſt it might be thought they
were afraid, they remained one day more in the ſame place, and the
next morning inſtead of advancing further into <hi>Focigny,</hi> they came and
encamped on this ſide <hi>Menoge</hi> at <hi>Anemaſſe,</hi> and <hi>Ville-la-grand,</hi> to keep
themſelves from any ſurprizal, and to hinder the enemies from poſting
themſelves towards this River between <hi>Geneva</hi> and them.<note place="margin">1591.</note> 
                  <hi>Dom

where they did not believe the Dukes Army, although ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding

were they ſeated, when five hundred Muſqueteers choſen out of the
Dukes Army,<note place="margin">The Kings Army attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Savoyards.</hi>

was ſo vigorous, that the <hi>French</hi> were immediately put to flight.
<hi>Quitry</hi> ſent three or four hundred Muſqueteers of <hi>Chantals</hi> and <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>'s
Regiments to help them, with three Companies belonging to
the Baron of S. <hi>Remy;</hi> but <hi>Dom Amedeé</hi> and <hi>Olivarez</hi> ſent forth a party
of about thirteen hundred Muſqueteers who won the Copſe, Ditches,
and Counter-ſcarps; <hi>Sonas</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Treſſort</hi> riding up at the
ſame time to ſecond them, leaping over a thick ſhort hedge to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the plain. When the Baron of <hi>Conforgien</hi> ſeeing them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
half over,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sonas</hi> ſlain.</note> he took this opportunity to fall upon them, and
charged them ſo vigorouſly, that <hi>Sonas,</hi> and the moſt reſolute of his
fellows being killed in the place, the reſt were put to flight, and
purſued beyond the hedge, as far as the main body of the Army;
where lay intrenched <hi>Dom Amedeé,</hi> and <hi>Olivarez,</hi> having a thick hedg
on one ſide of them. On the other part <hi>Chantal</hi> and <hi>Cherons</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
had newly attacked the one thouſand three hundred Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers,
with whom they had a ſharp conflict; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and
<hi>Neapolitans</hi> ſeeing their Horſe routed, began to quit their ground,
and were beat back as far as the place where their main body lay,
conſiſting of three thouſand men, who had not ſtirred all this while.
They retired ſo faſt that they threw one another into the Ditch, and
unhappy was he who was ſo tall that he could not ſtoop low enough
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50836:77"/>
to avoid the Shot. Their main Body defended them: and the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
rallying with much difficulty, having firſt rifled the ſlain,
who were near 300, amongſt whom were found above 100 Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
with <hi>Sonas</hi> their Leader. The Two Armies kept afterwards in
ſight one of another till Night.</p>
               <p>At midnight the <hi>Savoyards</hi> diſ-encamped and marched to <hi>Focig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
and paſſed over the River at <hi>Buringe,</hi> whoſe Bridge they broke
down leſt they ſhould be purſued. On the ſide of the <hi>French,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
their loſs was not half ſo great as their Enemies, yet did
they find themſelves much weakned, ſo that to avoid an utter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation
of their Forces, they took the way which led to the
<hi>Franche-Comté,</hi> and inſtead of the Baron of <hi>Conforgien,</hi> were left
at <hi>Geneva</hi> the Sieur <hi>Chaumont,</hi> and Captain <hi>Caron.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Savoyards</hi> being withdrawn,<note place="margin">May 17.</note> there were ſeveral inroads made
into their Country, in one of which there was taken at <hi>Thonon</hi> the

               <p>Soon after his departure <hi>Joachim</hi> of <hi>Rye</hi> Marquiſs of <hi>Treffort,</hi>
came and incamped with 300 Horſe and 800 Foot at <hi>Lancy,</hi> near

its being a place which might ſerve hereafter for a retreat to the
Enemy; which reſolution was put immediately into execution, but
with much regret, it being a very pleaſant Village, having near
ſeventy Houſes in it. The Baron of <hi>Conforgien</hi> was ſent for to
oppoſe the Marquiſs of <hi>Treffort,</hi> but it was two Months before
he came, about the time when there was a Truce made to laſt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50836:78"/>
three Months betwixt the King of <hi>France</hi> and the Confederate
Princes.<note place="margin">Sept. 9.</note> The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> likewiſe was comprehended, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of the propoſal. The Duke's Secretary <hi>Eſdiguieres</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Copy along with him, of this Truce, to <hi>Geneva,</hi> to know
whether they would accept of it; which was conſented to by
the Council of two hundred, and publiſhed on the 16th of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Six days after arrived Deputies from the four <hi>Cantons,</hi>

offer of their mediation between the Duke and the City; for
which they had thanks: And anſwer was returned them, That
they could not leave the <hi>French</hi>-Kings intereſt, who would be ſure
to reſent it, ſhould they conclude a Peace. The Truce was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
continued,<note place="margin">1594.</note> and laſted two Years, without any publication;

                  <note place="margin">The Fort of <hi>Arve</hi> demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</note> it occaſioning oftentimes the Enemy to invade them.</p>
               <p>During this Truce the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> kept a Governor under the
Kings name in the Country of <hi>Gex,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1595.</note> who held his Court of Juſtice
in <hi>Geneva,</hi> after the ſame maner as the Stewards of <hi>Gaillard, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blais,</hi>
and of the Country beyond the <hi>Arve.</hi> The <hi>Savoyards</hi> and
<hi>Genevoiſes</hi> began to be converſant one with another, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
Priſoners. There was a <hi>Genevois</hi> who had been taken thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years ſince, and had all that time ſerved in the Gallies, never
ſending word what was become of him, ſo that he was ſuppoſed
to be dead; his Wife, ſeven Years after his detention, was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
again, and had lived another ſeven Years with her ſecond
Husband. At the end of thirty Years, this her firſt Husband re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Geneva,</hi> and would have entred into his Houſe. His Wife
took him at firſt for an Impoſtor: whether that this long ſpace
of time had deprived her of all knowledge of him, or that
the grayneſs of his Hair and wrinkles in his Fore-head had
made this alteration, he having few charms left him to attract a
Womans love. The Husband might ſwear as long as he pleaſed
that he was the Man, yet for all this would ſhe not believe him.
The buſineſs at length came to a trial at Law, where he brought
ſuch proofs of his being her Husband, that ſhe openly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that it were impoſſible, for any but him, to have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of ſo many minute particulars. Having then at length owned
him for her Husband, they lived afterwards a great while toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1597.<note place="margin">1597.</note> there was ſpread a report throughout <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
Holland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sep.</note> and <hi>Italy,</hi> that <hi>Beza</hi> had renounced his Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Senate,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Beza</hi> reported to have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Papiſt.</hi>
                  </note> and had exhorted the Magiſtrates to reconcile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And, that by a ſpecial order from
the Pope, the Biſhop had abſolved him before his death, and that
in effect the City had ſent Deputies to <hi>Rome</hi> to yield obedience to
the Pope: which cauſed ſeveral People in <hi>Italy</hi> to reſort to <hi>Rome</hi>
to ſee theſe ſuppoſed Deputies. And yet <hi>Beza</hi> died not till ſix
Years after. There was a more likely report of a Peace concluded
betwixt the King and the confederate Princes:<note place="margin">1568.</note> it was not yet known

Cattel belonging to the <hi>Genevoiſes:</hi> whereupon they detained ſome
Troopers, who were <hi>Spaniards,</hi> being in the Dukes ſervice. The
<hi>Savoyards</hi> had apprehended <hi>Hoſea André</hi> a Miniſter, whom they had
taken in <hi>Michaille;</hi> and for a requital the Earl of <hi>Salenove</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
at <hi>Geneva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two days after <hi>Dom Philippin</hi> the Baſtard of <hi>Savoy,</hi>

highly treated by the Citizens. He on his part ſparing no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements.
He departed the next Morning, and promiſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the releaſement of <hi>Hoſea André;</hi> upon which the Earl of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenove</hi>
was releaſed before-hand. Yet the Miniſter was not ſet at

made his eſcape.</p>
               <p>The Peace was at length concluded betwixt the King of <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Peace concluded.</note>
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> in which were likewiſe compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
the <hi>Switzers</hi> and their Allies, and ſo by conſequence, <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
as the King of <hi>France</hi> openly declared it by word of Mouth as
well as by Letters; underſtanding thereby that the Duke ſhould
withdraw his Army. The Duke, who affirmed it was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
having not been named as the other Cities were, would
not return anſwer by writing, leſt he ſhould prejudice his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
cauſing only thoſe Forces to withdraw who had marched
over into <hi>Lombardy.</hi> Monſieur <hi>Villeroy</hi> in the printed Copy of
the Treaty of Peace, had added to the 34th Article, written with
his own Hand for the inſtruction of the Sieur <hi>Botheon,</hi> who was
ſent by the Duke to take the Copy of the Oath, That under the
generality of the Allies and confederate Lords were comprehended
them of <hi>Geneva. Chapeaurouge,</hi> their Deputy to the <hi>French</hi>-King,
brought home Letters, wherein that King promiſed to defray all
charges of the War.<note place="margin">1598.</note> The City to teſtifie how acceptable this
news was to them,<note place="margin">May.</note> cauſed their great Guns to be diſcharged,
and ſolemn Thanks to be returned to God in all their Churches.</p>
               <p>Yet was this rejoycing allaied by the return of the Plague, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the mortality was not great, and by the troubles wherein
they of <hi>Thonon</hi> were involved upon the account of Religion, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by a <hi>Capucin</hi>-Frier called <hi>Peter Cherubin,</hi> who would conſtrain
the Inhabitants of that place, and them in the Countries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
who were thought under obedience to the Duke, to return
likewiſe to their old Religion. This Frier challenged the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
to diſpute publickly with them; which they would not agree
to, chuſing rather to defend themſelves by writing: yet the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
of <hi>Geneva</hi> made them conſent to a verbal Conference:
and in the mean the Duke arriving at <hi>Thonon</hi> to forward the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the greateſt part of the People returned to their old Religion,
alledging they were forſaken; upon which there were printed
ſeveral Diſputes and Libels, which ſerved only to exaſperate
Mens ſpirits.<note place="margin">May.</note> Towards the end of <hi>May, John Serres</hi> died at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi>
having withdrew there after he had wrote the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>France:</hi>

The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> continued his claims on the City, and got
the Magiſtrates to conſent to a Conference, which was held at
<hi>Hermance</hi> by Deputies from both Parties, and laſted from the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>October,</hi> to the eleventh of <hi>November.</hi> His Highneſs's
Deputies were the Sieur <hi>Jacob</hi> his Lieutenants on this ſide of the
Mountains, the Preſident <hi>Rochette,</hi> the Preſident <hi>Berliet</hi> Baron of
<hi>Bourget, Lambert</hi> Baron of <hi>Terny,</hi> and <hi>Marin</hi> Earl of <hi>Viry.</hi> The
Deputies of <hi>Geneva</hi> were, the Councellors <hi>Maillet, Daufin, Lect</hi>
and <hi>Roſet,</hi> together with Secretary <hi>John Sarraſin.</hi> Them of <hi>Savoy</hi>
made their demands, and were anſwered by them of <hi>Geneva</hi> in
defence of their Priviledges. Whereunto the former made their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply;
and the latter returned a ſecond anſwer: ſo that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
at <hi>Hermance,</hi> Copies of which having been taken, is a
kind of Collection of all that can be ſaid on that ſubject, and is
ſufficient to make a large Volume. The difference remained as
before, it being a very difficult, if not impoſſible matter, for theſe
two States, ſo oppoſite in their Intereſts and Religion, to come to
any perfect agreement.</p>
               <p>Even the King himſelf, that he might allay the heats of both
Parties, wrote Letters which bore Date from the 11th of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi>
1599. in favour of the <hi>Genevoiſes,</hi> ſhewing that he took
the City and its Territories into his Protection, underſtanding it
to be compriſed under the name of Ally and Confederate, as it
had been already declared by the Deputies in the Treaty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Duke being gone to</hi> Paris,<note place="margin">1600.</note> 
                  <hi>towards the beginning of the
following Year, about the Marquiſdom of</hi> Saluces, <hi>which King</hi>
Henry <hi>urged him to reſtore,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> deſires that the King would deſiſt from Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>would have inſerted in the Articles
of Agreement, That the King ſhould deſiſt from protecting</hi> Geneva.
<hi>He got the Biſhop of</hi> Moderne <hi>the Popes</hi> Nuncio <hi>to mention it to
his Majeſty. This Prelate, watching his opportunity, tells him,</hi>
There was a means whereby he might fairly end the difference between
him and the Duke. That the ſame reaſon which enjoyned the Duke to
render him the Marquiſdom, inſinuated in like manner, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
ſhould not hinder the Duke from obtaining what belonged to him
as his right. <hi>To which the King aſſenting, he drew from thence
this conſequence:</hi> That the City of <hi>Geneva</hi> belonging to the Duke,
and nothing hindering him from re-eſtabliſhing the Authority which his
Fathers had in it, but only his Majeſties Protection, it is therefore
reaſonable <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> that if he reſtores to you the Marquiſdom of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luces,</hi>
which belongs to you, you ſhould in like manner permit him to
have the City of <hi>Geneva</hi> which is his own.<note place="margin">1600.</note> 
                  <hi>The King to anſwer
this Argument, tells him the caſe was different; for it was not he
who had taken the City into his Protection, but his predeceſſors,
and that he was obliged to it by the Oath taken at the Treaty,
and by the reſpect he owed his Predeceſſors: And farther, That
what he had done, proceeding from the acknowledgment of the
good ſervices he had received from that City, it was neither
handſom nor juſt to violate this Obligation. The Prelate had his
anſwer ready:</hi> You will not Sir, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> leave protecting <hi>Geneva</hi>
becauſe of the example of your Anceſtors; and by the ſame reaſon the
Duke is not obliged to reſtore you the Marquiſdom of <hi>Saluces,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50836:79"/>
it belongs not to you, but to the deceaſed King your predeceſſor who took it.
<hi>To which the King replied,</hi> The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> hath uſurped my Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſdom,
nothing can excuſe an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper from reſtoring that which he
hath taken; neither will I hinder his claims on <hi>Geneva,</hi> provided he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
not against them in a hoſtile manner: for if he uſes violence, I know
what I have to do. And whereas he is of opinion that if I ſhould abandon
them, he could ſoon ſubdue them to himſelf, I would therefore have him
conſider, how much thereby I ſhould diſhonour both my ſelf and
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And thus dropt the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s propoſal, and conſequently
the Treaty of agreement. The King took the Field, and won in a
ſhort time <hi>Breſſe</hi> and all <hi>Savoy,</hi> except the Caſtle of the Borough,
and S. <hi>Catherines</hi> Fort which lay two Leagues diſtant from <hi>Geneva,</hi>
before which he came and encamped. This Fort was built with five
corners, and raiſed on four firm Baſtions incompaſſed with Ditches,
which laid the Campain level and open, on the higheſt part of which
this Fort was ſituated. There was in it a Carriſon of ſix hundred
men, this was the ſoreſt thorn in the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> foot. So the King
who deſired to gratifie them, kindly received their Deputies, who
were enjoyned to requeſt of the King in conſideration of the ſervice
which they had done the Crown, and of their ſufferings in the late
War, he would be pleaſed to put this Fort into their hands to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed,
it having been ſo prejudicial to him. The Duke of <hi>Saully</hi>
introduced theſe Deputies into the Kings preſence.</p>
               <p>Theodorus de Beze <hi>chief Miniſter,</hi>

                  <hi>whoſe age and learning made

which are due to you to the holy Angels, for having reſcued the Churches of

               <p>
                  <hi>To which the King anſwered,</hi>

much, are worthy the reputation which Monſieur <hi>Beze</hi> hath acquired by
well ſpeaking. I take them in good part, and accept them with thoſe kind

to imitate them in this, and in all other things anſwerable to the glory of

Duke of</hi> Sully,) to whoſe charge I commit this affair.</p>
               <p>From that time the City Gates were ſet open to all belonging to
the Court and Army, ſo that there was reckoned one Evening to
be in it above four thouſand men; and amongſt others, ſeveral Lords,
as <hi>Meſſieurs</hi> of <hi>Guiſe, Elboeuf, Eſpernon, Guiche</hi> and <hi>Biron;</hi> the laſt
of theſe walking with ſome Councellors of <hi>Geneva</hi> as he came to S.
<hi>Gervais,</hi> upon ſome diſcourſe begun, he clapt his hand to his Sword
and told them, <hi>Gentlemen, This ſhall do your work, or I will loſe my life.</hi>
They thanked him for his good will, but he made it appear after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that he meant otherwiſe than they underſtood him. Monſieur
<hi>Sully</hi> who came likewiſe, eaſed them of their trouble in being ſo
crouded with people, having ordered his Horſe and ſeveral Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers
to return to the Camp. The Fort capitulated ſoon after the
Trench was made, they within promiſing to ſurrender, if they were
not ſuccoured in ten days,<note place="margin">Decem. 16.</note> which was only a formal buſineſs, ſeeing
it was well known the Duke was not in a capacity to relieve them.
The Garriſon marched out beating their Drums,<note place="margin">The Fort razed.</note> and their Colours
flying, with three pieces of Ordnance. Monſieur <hi>Sully</hi> blew up im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
the Baſtions by means of the Mine, of which the <hi>Genevoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
having notice, according to the Kings Order, there came ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them, and fell ſo wholly to their work, that within a day or
two there was not the leaſt trace to be ſeen; the King gave them ſix
Cannons which were found in the Fort.</p>
               <p>There hapned three months before a thing very remarkable:<note place="margin">1600.</note> After
ſeveral great Claps of Thunder which laſted all the Morning,<note place="margin">Sept. 16.</note> the
<hi>Rhoſne</hi> after ſeveral ebbings and flowings,<note place="margin">The Ebbings and flowings of the <hi>Rhoſne.</hi>

ſome places, where it was wont to be five foot deep; the Boats
which were at the Lakes mouth relying on the ground, ſo that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

down, and picked up old Iron; but the waters immediately return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
happy was he who could ſooneſt get away. If one of theſe refluxes
had laſted but one quarter of an hour, the houſes on the Bridge,
and part of S. <hi>Gervais</hi> would have been drowned; it is very likely
that this prodigy was occaſioned by ſome kind of Earthquake or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing
of the Earth, by which the ground where the <hi>Rhoſne</hi> iſſues
forth from the Lake, being twice or thrice lifted up by the ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean

in that great Earthquake, which raiſed up that heap of Earth, which
we have already mentioned, and cauſed the Lake to overflow twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
paces, which inſtance may ſerve to confirm the other. All the
difference lies here, that theſe exhalations were not ſtrong enough to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50836:80"/>
force a paſſage, and to ſhake the neighbouring parts. That which
makes this more clear, was an Earthquake which reached from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi>
as far as <hi>Switzerland,</hi> which hapned a year after in the ſame
month, with ſo great a violence, that Monſieur <hi>James Godefroy</hi> obſerved

let it remain in their poſſeſſion, as a place whereon depended the

their requeſt, ſeeing that by the Treaty held at <hi>Lyons</hi> betwixt him
and the Duke, <hi>La Breſſe, Veromey,</hi> and <hi>Gex,</hi> were to be incorporated
into the Crown, and were never to be cut off from it, upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.

               <p>In the Summer following the Jubilee was celebrated at <hi>Thonon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1602.</note>

which the Citizens could hardly believe, the Articles of Peace
having been ſworn to by both parties to be obſerved, reſting ſecure on
the two Treaties held at <hi>Verins</hi> and <hi>Lyons,</hi> not conſidering that the
Invaſion of theſe Villages, and the ſeizure of ſeveral Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
were the ſparks of a fire which would ſoon break out into a
flame.</p>
               <p>There were complaints made of this to the Sieur <hi>Albigny,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
General on this ſide of the Mountains; his proper name was
<hi>De Gordes,</hi> ſon to him who had been Governor of <hi>Dauphiny;</hi> but
he had left the Kings ſervice for his Highneſſes. He made anſwer
to the Meſſengers from <hi>Geneva</hi> two ſeveral times, that it was both
his own and his Maſters intention to let them live in peace; and that
his Highneſs meant the Treaty ſhould be religiouſly obſerved.
Moreover the Preſident <hi>Rochelle</hi> Counſellor of State was arrived at
<hi>Geneva</hi> ſome days before this <hi>Scalado,</hi> for to lull the Magiſtrates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep,
to obſerve their countenance, and to underſtand the condition
of the City; telling them it was expedient to make ſome laſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
profering his aſſiſtance for the carrying on ſo good a
work.<note place="margin">A warning given to the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> concerning the attempt on their City.</note>

               <p>Whereupon the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> reſting ſecure, and diſtruſting nothing,
neglected the guarding of the City; although they had warning

one from <hi>Cheſne,</hi> who drawing near to the Gate, the day before the

was coming, and that they ſhould ſtand upon their guard: but this
advertiſment was ſlighted, either for want of due heed, or elſe that

would undertake any thing right or wrong. <hi>Brunaulieu</hi> this Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
Lieutenant had with ſome others viewed the City at his eaſe,
taken the height of the walls, and the depths of the ditches in the night
and had aſſured <hi>Albigny</hi> of the facility of the enterprize; moreover
the intelligence which they held with the <hi>Syndick</hi> of the guard, who
was to diſplace the Sentinel from that part where they were to ſcale,
made their undertaking ſo ſure, that on Saturday the eleventh of
<hi>December,</hi> which was the day before the execution of their intended
enterprize, ſeveral perſons came into the City to buy Horſes, and
had ſpoken Aenigmatically that they would come the next day to
conclude the bargain. It was confidently affirmed (how true I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell) that <hi>Brunaulieu</hi> before he ſet forth on this enterprize, had
by a ſpecial diſpenſation received the extream Unction, ſwearing he
would live no longer, if he could not effect his deſign; and that the
reſt had confeſſed themſelves and taken the Sacrament upon it. The

the Oath made at the Jubilee in <hi>Thonon</hi> for the extirpation of

               <p>In the mean time <hi>Albigny</hi> began to draw up his men towards ſix

                  <hi>La Roche,</hi> and <hi>Bonneville.</hi>
It was on the 11. or 12. day of the Month according to the old ſtile,
and the longeſt night in the year. He had his Company of guards,
the Regiment belonging to Baron <hi>de la val d' Iſere,</hi> four Troops of

quartered at <hi>Anecy,</hi> and were to make up the Rear-guard, and
march up as ſoon as they had notice. Out of the firſt Troops were
choſen three hundred men, armed at all points with Breaſt-plates,
and their Helmets on their heads, their Piſtols at their Girdles,
their Cutlaces in their hands, and another party of them with half
Pikes and Muſquets. As they marched along they ſtopped the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants
in their way, leſt they ſhould alarm the City; yet were there
ſome who eſcaped and came to the Gates thereof,<note place="margin">Warning a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the City.</note> giving notice to

but their words were not regarded, being taken for people who
jeſted. The Watch whoſe duty was to lie out of the City, in order
to diſcover any who ſhould approach it, had diſperſed themſelves,
and perceived not the Troops, who advanced undiſcovered along the
<hi>Arve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke who doubted not of the ſucceſs, came poſt Incognito
from beyond the Mountains, and cauſed himſelf to be called Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur

the Ambaſſador. He came the ſame Night to the Bridge of
<hi>Tremblieres,</hi> which is a little Village about a League diſtant from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi>
that he might animate by his preſence thoſe who were fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
Firſt of all a Hare ſtarting up amongſt them, as they drew
near to <hi>Champel,</hi> where was the place of their Rendeſvous, ſtruck
ſome of them with terror. About five or ſix hundred paces from
the Ditch they ſpied ſeveral Stakes drove into the Ground, on
which workmen were wont to hang their Serges to dry them.
The Night being dark, and neither Moon or Stars appearing, there
were them who took this for ſome Ambuſcade laid by the City,
and were thus ranged in a row in expectation of their coming.
Yet they took courage, and having left the main Body of their
Army in <hi>Plein-Palais, Brunaulieu</hi> and the reſoluteſt of them, who
had undertaken to ſcale the City, and who were come on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
light off, and made towards the Counterſcarp, and went
down into the Ditch of <hi>Corraterie.</hi> No ſooner were they there
but a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

leſt theſe Birds (like the Geeſe of the <hi>Capitol</hi> who ſaved <hi>Rome)</hi>
would wake the Sentinels, and ſpoil their Enterprize.</p>
               <p>At length taking courage,<note place="margin">The <hi>Savoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> raiſed up Ladders againſt the City-Walls.</note> they paſſed ſoftly over the Ditch
upon Hurdles, which they had laid to keep themſelves from ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the Mud, and raiſed up three Ladders againſt the Walls,
near the Watch Tower towards <hi>Monnoye,</hi> and to try if any body
heard them, they took up Stones and knocked with them againſt
the Walls, as they ſince related. <hi>Brunaulieu</hi> had made the ſame tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
heretofore, and was not heard, becauſe that for a long time they
had placed no Watch there. But before we proceed, we may take
notice of the form of their Ladders: they were coloured with black,
to make them undiſcerned in the dark, and made of ſeveral joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
pieces, that they might be more eaſier carried by the Mules,
and ſhortned or lengthened as they had occaſion. The Feet of
them were ſhod with ſharp Iron Spikes, that they might be
eaſilier faſtned, and ſtand firmer in the ground. The top of theſe
Ladders, which were to touch the Wall, were furniſhed with a
Pully, and covered with a thick Cloth, that they might ſlide the
eaſier and with leſs noiſe. They who would better comprehend
the faſhion of them, may ſee part of them ſtill kept in the <hi>Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
of <hi>Geneva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Ladders they were furniſhed with great Steel Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
one end of which had ſharp edges to cut the Chains of the
Draw-bridge, the Locks and Bolts; they had likewiſe great Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
to pluck out Nails and Hinges from the Gates, and ſeveral
Petards to burſt them open. And being thus furniſhed, they began
to climb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sonas</hi> who was one of the reſoluteſt of the Company,<note place="margin">

determined to revenge the death of his Father, who was killed at

the Ladder, and being gotten half way up received ſuch a
blow by the fall of a Stone from the Wall, as almoſt took away
his ſenſes, and was forced to come down. <hi>Albigny,</hi> whom it moſt

foot, encouraging his Soldiers, by ſetting before them the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and booty which they might expect if they prevailed. He
animated likewiſe <hi>Sonas,</hi> who began to climb again. A <hi>Scotch</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit

aſſuring them, That if they ſhould die in the Enterprize, the
Rounds of the Ladders would be as ſo many ſteps leading them
directly to Heaven. But the good Father could not foreſee that
it was on an other kind of Ladder provided for them that they
were to get thither. He had likewiſe given them little Bills,
wherein were written ſome paſſages of Holy Scripture; and
other pieces of Paper, in the Form of Conjurations, which would
preſerve them, who carried them, from any violent death.</p>
               <p>It was about one of the Clock in the Morning when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to mount,<note place="margin">Dec. 12.</note> and the 12th of <hi>December</hi> according to the old
Style,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sonas</hi> with ſix others firſt climb up into the City.</note> and the 22d of the ſaid Month according to the new; all
things were quiet and ſtill, ſo that <hi>Sonas, Attignac,</hi> and ſix others,
who were firſt entred into the City through <hi>Tartaſſe,</hi> which is a
Gate within, always left open, walked about the Streets by couples,
to obſerve whether the People were faſt aſleep, and whether this
great ſilence was not ſome trick to intrap them. But all was quiet;
And they behind climbed up in great numbers.</p>
               <p>The Duke underſtanding that the moſt couragious amongſt his
Men were entred without reſiſtance,<note place="margin">The Duke diſpatches Meſſengers to all parts, to impart the news of their ſucceſs.</note> ſent to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans,</hi>
commanding them to come up quickly, and diſpatched
Curriers to all parts to carry news of this happy beginning, which
cauſed it to be confidently reported in <hi>Piedmont, Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiné,</hi> that the City was taken. And indeed the Duke might well
believe himſelf to be Maſter of it, there having already entred
200 of the ſtouteſt Men in the Army; ſome of which lay flat on
the Ground under the Trees of the <hi>Parapet,</hi> others ſtood up cloſe
againſt the Houſes in <hi>Corraterie,</hi> till they ſhould be ſtronger: for
<hi>Brunaulieu</hi> and others who were chief mannagers of the deſign, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
not to appear till four of the Clock in the Morning, that
their Men might have more time to climb up, and that the Rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
might draw near, and likewiſe that they might have more
light to carry on a buſineſs of ſo great conſequence. But before
that time, betwixt two and three in the Morning, a Soldier, who
ſtood Sentinel in the Tower of <hi>Monnoye,</hi> having heard ſome noiſe
in the Ditch, called his Corporal, to know what it might be. The
Corporal ſends a Soldier with a Lanthorn; who takes along with
him his Muſquet, and gets upon the <hi>Parapet,</hi> and perceives ſome
armed Men making towards him, to whom he cried, <hi>Who comes
there?</hi> and having no anſwer, he diſcharged his Muſquet at them.
They immediately fell upon him, and as he cried, <hi>Arm, Arm,</hi> they
knocked him down. Which the Soldier who ſtood on the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
perceiving, he diſcharged his Piece to give notice to the main
Guard, who, alas, were but ſix Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brunaulieu,</hi> and the moſt reſolute amongſt them, perceiving they
were diſcovered, and that it was impoſſible for them to put it off
any longer, and finding moreover that they were ſtrong enough
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50836:82"/>
in number in the City, reſolved immediately to ſtand to it, and
to diſpoſe of their Men to the beſt advantage, and to ſet upon
thoſe who ſhould oppoſe them, in four ſeveral places, <hi>viz.</hi> at the
new Gate, at <hi>Tartaſſe,</hi> at <hi>Monnoye,</hi> and at the entrance of the
Town-houſe, which they would keep till the Petards could be
brought to the new Gate, to force a paſſage, and let in the Troops
which lay at <hi>Plein-Palais:</hi> reſerving a conſiderable Party to aſſiſt
them, who ſtill were climbing up.</p>
               <p>They fiercely then ſet upon the Guard at the new Gate, who
were no more than thirteen Men, ſome of which belonged to the
neighbouring Sentries. The moſt part of the Guard, when they
had Fired, betook themſelves to their Heels, and ran to give the
Alarm to thoſe who watched the Town-houſe, to the Bourg of
<hi>Four,</hi> and to the gate of <hi>Rive.</hi> They were purſued as far as <hi>la
Treille,</hi> which was ſpeedily clapt to. The Enemies then finding
this paſſage ſhut, came down to the new Gate, of which they
were Maſters. In the mean time, of the three who remained at
this Gate, two of them hid themſelves, and the third getting on
the top of the Gate, adviſedly thought to let down the Percul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.
The Perſon who mannaged the Petard, was amazed to find
his deſign of applying it ineffectual, being prevented by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullice.</p>
               <p>A Citizen, who was one of the firſt who awaked at this
noiſe, came out of his Houſe, which was near the Gate of
<hi>Tartaſſe,</hi> and would have paſſed down half dreſſed, with his
Halbard, to repair to his quarters at the new Gate. In coming
down, he diſcovered four or five armed Men who made up to him
to get before him to <hi>Tartaſſe.</hi> He believing they belonged to the
City, asked them aloud, whereabouts the Enemy was: they ſtill
advancing towards him, cried out to him, <hi>Peace, Slave, come hither,
and be on our ſide, God bleſs the Duke of</hi> Savoy: upon which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it was the Enemy, he flies back, and alarm'd the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
ſtreets. In the mean time the Enemy won the Gate of
<hi>Tartaſſe,</hi> keeping their ground, and endeavoured to make good the
paſſage. The Citizens ran thither, and began to barricado the
way which led to this Gate. Some of them having been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with their Torches, were wounded; others paſſing boldly
on were killed. <hi>Canal,</hi> who was of the City-Council, and Captain of
thoſe parts of the City, a Man in years, but of great courage, was
ſlain after this manner: He was helped in his paſſing over the
Chain, which was faſtned at the corner of the Street, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to venture no farther: yet, not believing the Enemy to be ſo
near, he would needs go on till it was too late for him to
think of returning. The Enemies perceiving the Citizens to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
apace, left the place, and returned to their fellows at the new
Gate.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the City being througly alarm'd, ſome of them
rendred themſelves according to cuſtom at their uſual place of Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous;
others without any ſtop, ran where was the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
directly upon the Enemy, who believing that they had fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
their Enterprize, ſhouted out a-long <hi>Corraterie, God bleſs the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50836:83"/>
King of</hi> Spain, <hi>God bleſs the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>the City is our own; Kill, kill,
kill them; Down with them, down with them.</hi> The firſt who met were
known to one another by their Watch-word, which conſiſted in
a kind of noiſe like the croaking of a Frog, or like unto that which
Riders uſe in incouraging their Horſes. When they were asked
by them of the City, Who goes there? They anſwered, <hi>Friends.</hi>
There were ſome, who to divide them who might come in to help
their Companions, cried out aloud, <hi>Arm, Arm, Arm, the Enemy is
at the Gate of</hi> Rive.</p>
               <p>The Enemy had broke twice through the Guards at <hi>Monnoye,</hi>
and having burſt open one of the Doors, behind which the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
had barricadoed themſelves, would have paſſed on further, and
have ruſhed into the City: but being met by the Grand Rounds,
who made head againſt them, there were ſome of them left dead
in the place. The Citizens likewiſe coming in, briskly charged
thoſe who put themſelves in a poſture of paſſing through this Gate
of <hi>Monnoye,</hi> killed one on the Bridge of <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> and another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Gate and the Percullice, which was let down.</p>
               <p>Being driven back thence, there were ſome who endeavoured to
break into the Houſes in <hi>Corraterie,</hi> to plunder them, or to paſs
through into the City-ſtreet, and began firſt with <hi>Julien Piaget</hi>'s
Houſe, where they killed the Serving man, and applied a Petard
to the Stable-door, from which they were beaten away. Whilſt
theſe things were doing, a Canoneer having fired a Cannon from
the Bulwark of <hi>Oye,</hi> which lay level to the Walls, he had the good
hap to ſhatter the Ladders, and threw them all down. The firſt
report having been heard by the Regiment of <hi>La Val d' Iſere,</hi> who
lay quiet in <hi>Plein-Palais,</hi> ſome of them cried out in amaze, <hi>March
up, march up, the City is our own,</hi> thinking that the Petard had made
this noiſe, and the Drums without any farther notice began to
beat: which ſet them all a running towards the new Gate, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
already the ſpoil amongſt them: but they were very much
ſurprized to find it ſtill ſhut; ſo that deſcending into the Ditch,
near their Scaling-Ladders, the Gunner having fired his Cannon a
ſecond time, charged with ſmall Shot, made a ſlaughter amongſt
them. The Horſe, ſome diſtance off, having heard the ſound of
the Drum, and perceived the light of the Torches in ſeveral parts
of the City, had a ſhort joy in approaching unto it, of which they
believed their own Men had made themſelves Maſters.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time a ſmall party of Citizens, who iſſued out
through the Gate of <hi>Treille</hi> and S. <hi>Leger,</hi> reſolving to ſacrifice
their Lives in defence of their Country, came down to recover
the new Gate. They ſet upon the Guards there in a moſt reſolute
manner, and had two of their Men immediately ſlain, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
fighting vigorouſly. <hi>Picot,</hi> who managed the Petard, being
buſied about it, was killed. Seconded at length by others who ran
to their aſſiſtance, they drove the Enemy from their Court of
Guard adjoyning to the Gate, and made them retreat to the middle
of <hi>Corraterie,</hi> to the Party who lay to aſſiſt thoſe who ſcaled the
Walls.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:50836:83"/>
The <hi>Savoyards</hi> being greatly aſtoniſhed to find themſelves ſhut up
betwixt the Walls and the Houſes, and knowing not which way
to turn themſelves, began to loſe their courage. They proffered
to let down <hi>Brunaulieu</hi> from the Wall with a Rope. But he choſe
rather to die than to live with ſhame: The Shot flew about their
Ears like Hail-ſtones, out of the Windows and tops of the Houſes.
<hi>Baudichon,</hi> one of the City Captains, who was half dreſſed, ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
himſelf moſt eminently.<note place="margin">The valour of a Taylor.</note> A Taylor who brandiſhed a two-handed
Sword, did wonders. A Woman throwing out on purpoſe
an Iron-pot on the Head of one of the moſt reſolute amongſt
them, ſplit his Scull.</p>
               <p>The Citizens courage increaſing, and the <hi>Savoyards</hi> ſeeing above
fifty of their Men lying on the Ground, betook themſelves to the
place where their Ladders ſtood, on which ſome already had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
themſelves, making more haſte to get down than they did
to get up, fear having given them wings: but finding no Ladders,
they caſt themſelves down from the Wall, at which the good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Alexander</hi> found himſelf beſides his reckoning, one of theſe
armed Men having ſadly bruiſed him in falling from the Wall. The
<hi>Chevalier Dandelot</hi> ſliding down broke his Noſe. Others were
maimed or killed by ſo dangerous a leap. They who lay dead in
the City were reckoned to be about 54. the greateſt part of them
being Officers and Men of note, and 13 were taken Priſoners. The
Cannon was brought on the Platform of <hi>Treille,</hi> and was levelled
againſt <hi>Plein-Palais,</hi> and perfectly routed both the Horſe and Foot
which lay there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albigny</hi> being aſtoniſhed at the unſucceſsfulneſs of his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
ſo well contrived and ſo ill performed, and finding the Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers
(as he was wont to term the <hi>Genevoiſes)</hi> had courage to
defend themſelves, and to make his Men leap over the Walls, ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a Retreat, which was very welcom to his diſperſed Troops,
who were benummed with fear and cold. They marched back in
haſte to the ſide of <hi>Bonne,</hi> and brought the Duke the news of the
unfortunate ſucceſs which the Sieur of <hi>Albigny</hi>'s raſhneſs had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duçed.
The Duke ſaid nothing elſe to him, but that <hi>he had made
a very fair flouriſh:</hi> For this was his common expreſſion.</p>
               <p>In the ſame day the thirteen Priſoners were condemned to be
hanged,<note place="margin">Thirteen of them who had ſcaled the City, hanged.</note> which ſome have cenſured as too ſevere; but the Magiſtrates
alledged that they conſidered them not under the notion of Enemies,
but Thieves who broke in in the night, and who had violated contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to all right, a Peace which had been ſo ſolemnly ſworn to. It is ſaid
of <hi>Sonas,</hi> that he would have redeemed himſelf for his weight in ſilver.
<hi>Chaffardon, Attignac,</hi> and other perſons of Quality, were treated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſame manner, and were accompanied by the Miniſters to the
place of Execution. The Council of ſixty ordered that their heads,
as likewiſe of the others who were killed between the Walls, ſhould
be cut off, and ranged on the Wall of the Bullwark near the place
where they ſcaled, and their bodies to be thrown into the <hi>Rhoſne.</hi>
They were found to be ſixty ſeven in all; and it was ſuperſtitiouſly
obſerved, that it had been ſo many years ſince they had thrown off
the <hi>Romiſh</hi> yoke: but if we reckon thoſe who were ſlain in the Ditch,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50836:84"/>
and died by the way, the number will amount to two hundred;
whoſe quality the Enemy kept ſecret: it is known they loſt <hi>Cornage,</hi>
the Sieur <hi>Albigny</hi> Lieutenant, <hi>De Gruzy, La Tour,</hi> and <hi>Payen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> ſide there were but thirty wounded, amongſt
whom was the principal <hi>Syndick Peter Forbry,</hi> and <hi>John Bodichon;</hi> and
ſeventeen killed, who were interred in S. <hi>Gervais</hi> with an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Epitaph. It is ſaid that <hi>Theodore de Beze,</hi> who was then alive
but very ancient, heard not the leaſt noiſe of this uproar and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
and was amazed when he was led forth to ſee the ſlain, who
lay ſtretched out along <hi>Corraterie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Beza</hi> Preaches a thankſgiving Sermon for their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> He had left off Preaching, yet did

which is obſerved by an Order of Council once a year, with publick

Faſt, to offer up unto God their ſolemn acknowledgements. There
was likewiſe ſet up in the Town-houſe a <hi>Latine</hi> Inſcription for a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting

<hi>Proteſtant</hi> Cantons ſent them immediately twelve hundred men,

but hath alſo ſet on foot ſeveral deſigns to ſurprize our City in the
midſt of the Calms of Peace. It hath hapned then, that for to obtain
his pernicious ends, that the Sieur <hi>Albigny</hi> on Saturday laſt, the
Eleventh of this Month, about Midnight, brought before our City on
the ſide of <hi>Plein-Palais,</hi> about two thouſand choſen Men, both
Horſe and Foot, and hath cauſed two hundred of them to deſcend into
our Ditch towards <hi>Corraterie,</hi> where was heretofore a Gate leading
to the City; and having provided Ladders, cauſed them to climb
the Walls about three of the Clock in the Morning, on Sunday the
Twelfth of the ſaid Month, he ſtanding in the Ditch, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
them; ſo that having gotten down into the City, ſome of them
marched directly to the new Gate, endeavouring to force it open,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50836:84"/>
and to bring in their main body to aſſiſt them, which lay at <hi>Plein-Palais:</hi>
others would have gained the Gate of <hi>Monnoye,</hi> to enter
by this means into the heart of the City: but it hath pleaſed our good
God to look down upon us with an eye of pitty, and to encourage our
men in ſuch a manner that they drove them back, and ſlew the
greateſt part of them; ſome have been taken and hanged ſince by
our Order. The remaining part have caſt themſelves down from the
Walls, ſo that ſeveral of them being wounded, have died thereupon.
This is a marvelous deliverance which God hath wrought for us, and
for which we are bound to praiſe him. But it being very likely
that the ſaid Sieur <hi>Albigny</hi> intends to prosecute his deſign; and in as

               <p>The King was immediately informed that <hi>Geneva</hi> was taken, the
deſign appearing ſo likely to take effect, that there was leſs reaſon to
doubt of it than to believe it. He was not undeceived till he received
Letters from the Sieur <hi>de la Guiche,</hi> which preceded the account which
the City publiſhed. His Majeſty vouchſafed to write to them of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi>

               <p>The day wherein the Walls were ſcaled, had been a day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and confuſion to every body in general; but it had like to have
proved double dangerous to the <hi>Syndicks:</hi> for on Saturday night a
man came to the Gate of <hi>Rive,</hi> to give notice of the Enemies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
which news was carried to the chief <hi>Syndick;</hi> who remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the affair to the fourth <hi>Syndick</hi> who was a ſavourer of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
ſo that this was like ſending <hi>a Patient from the Phyſician to the
Hangman.</hi> The people who could not brook this proceeding, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the danger threatning them, and what they had already ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
determined thereupon to be revenged on theſe two <hi>Syndicks:</hi>
but they were ſo prudent or fearful as to keep their Chambers till
noon, the time when the Priſoners were led to execution; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
then running to behold this ſpectacle, were taken off from the
thoughts of being revenged on them. The Sermons at night allayed
the heats of ſome. One of the Senators had made anſwer, when they
went to him for the keys of the <hi>Arſenal</hi> to take out Arms, <hi>Surely
theſe are not Birds to flie thus over the Walls:</hi> not believing it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for them to get in.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the Year,<note place="margin">1603.</note> there aroſe a great difference in the
general Council,<note place="margin">Jan.</note> in the choice of <hi>Syndicks,</hi> by reaſon of the ſcaling the
Walls which had hapned three weeks before, for fear they ſhould fall
into the hands of ſome Magiſtrates ill affected to the publick. At

and likewiſe for that contrary to his Oath, he had betrayed the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the City in the caſe of the Village of <hi>Moin,</hi> at the inſtance
of one of his Creditors who was a Counſellor in <hi>Berne.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
a Priſoner ſeven years, and at length was releaſed, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
with his family into <hi>Savoy,</hi> where he had a ſmall Penſion allowed
him, but not ſufficient to maintain him; ſo that he was forced to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50836:85"/>
live very ſparingly, he died in the year 1625. having perſevered in
his Religion, amongſt them of the contrary party. He was much
pittied, being a man learned; for it was he who compoſed thoſe neat
Inſcriptions which are to be ſeen in the Biſhops Palace.</p>
               <p>The Duke gave out that the principal motive which induced him
to make the late attempt on <hi>Geneva,</hi> was the eſtabliſhment of the
<hi>Catholick</hi> Religion amongſt them; for the promoting of ſo good a
work, he having neither ſpared his Soldiers, his Treaſure nor his
Perſon. But the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> replied thereupon, that he took not the
way to ſhew himſelf zealous for Religion, when he gave ſuch a plain
demonſtration how little he valued his Oath; and that doubtleſs
God would not let them eſcape unpuniſhed who had taken his name
in vain. On the other ſide the Earl of <hi>Tournon</hi> his Higneſſes Reſident
amongſt the Cantons, came from <hi>Fribourg</hi> to <hi>Berne,</hi> for to make
this following Harangue to the Lords of that City, and to endeavor

I was deſirous of nothing more than of knowing from
my Soveraign Lord and Prince, how the matter really had paſſed,
to the end that I might, in the name of his Highneſs, inform your
Lordſhips and other affectionate Friends; ſeeing that in ſuch like
affairs, falſe Reports never fail to be ſpread abroad by the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.
For being deſtitute of all lawful reaſons and equity, they
have endeavoured to colour over their bad cauſe, to the diſhonour
and prejudice of his Highneſs, and to render him odious to his
friends. Wherefore having been advertiſed by his Highneſs as
well by word of mouth as by writing, and alſo by his Secretary who
is joyned with me in this affair, of the whole truth of the matter,
and having received an expreſs charge to communicate the ſame
unto you, according to the good correſpondence which ought to be
amongſt Neighbours, to the end ye may no longer doubt of my
Maſters good will and affection. My ſelf I ſay, and his Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
would not be wanting likewiſe to inform you according to the
inſtructions given us of this late undertaking; this then in ſhort
is the true account of it. Your Lordſhips know very well the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
moving his Highneſs to make the late War againſt the City
of <hi>Geneva,</hi> it being upon the account of the Tallies, Impoſts,
and other ordinary Charges on the Eſtates which the <hi>Genevoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
hold in his Highneſſes Dominions. They were ſollicited and
intreated to ſubmit to reaſon and equity, after the ſame manner
as their other Neighbours who poſſeſs Eſtates in his Highneſſes
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50836:86"/>
Countries. But they on the other ſide have never ceaſed from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their complaints, and repreſenting their cauſe to his Majeſty
of <hi>France,</hi> as alſo to your Lordſhips, although they have been
rebuked by ſeveral noble Lords about his Majeſty, for their unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
requeſts, and ſent back to make ſatisfaction to thoſe equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
demands, after the ſame manner as your Lordſhips have dealt
with them. Yet have they ſtill obſtinately continued in their unjuſt
pretenſions, and have not only endeavoured by force to maintain their
pretended right, as his Highneſs hath been well informed; but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
moreover contrary to his Highneſs's declaration, to bring
and convey into their City Corn, which ought not to be tranſported
out of his Highneſs's Countries, for the relief of his Subjects, and
to preſerve in ſtore againſt time of need; ſo that they have by this
means infringed and violated this <hi>Edict,</hi> for which juſt cauſes
and reaſons, his Highneſs had a deſign of bringing <hi>Geneva</hi> to
Reaſon, but he hath deferred his reſentments till ſome other oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
eſpecially till his Highneſs can be preſent in his own perſon,
to prevent all miſchief and confuſion, which commonly happens in
ſuch like occaſions. But foraſmuch as the ſaid <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the priviledges granted them by your predeceſſors of bleſſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
againſt the pretenſions of hs Higneſs, they are of no vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
ſeeing they have not acquitted themſelves in what they were
obliged to on their parts, and have by this means made void their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.
And thus it is likewiſe in the claims which they lay to the
Treaty, as if they were comprehended in it, and included with his
Majeſty of <hi>France,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> my Maſter: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it ought to be conſidered in this caſe, they have no grounds or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for their pretenſions, for it is certain they cannot be underſtood
under this word of Allies, ſeeing they are not in League with all the
<hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and that they have not been expreſsly
ſpecified and named as the other Allies; and ſo conſequently could
they not be inſerted in his Highneſs's abſence againſt his will and
pleaſure, as being a party principally concerned. Moreover I will not
forbear to tell your Lordſhips, that his Highneſs has been credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that my Lord <hi>Eſdiguieres</hi> deſigned to ſurprize the ſaid City;
which had he effected, it would have proved highly prejudicial to his
Highneſs and to your ſelves, and therefore his Highneſs thought it
his moſt prudent courſe to prevent him. But leſt your Lordſhips
ſhould ſuſpect that he had any deſign againſt you his ancient Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
with whom he hath all this while held ſo good a correſpondence;
He hath therefore withdrawn his men on this ſide the Mountains,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50836:86"/>

               <p>This Harangue of the Earl of <hi>Tournon</hi> was heard by the Council
of <hi>Berne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> not ſatjsfied with this harangue.</note> yet did it not ſatisfie them; for they diſmiſſed both him
and the Secretary without anſwer, and had they not ſpeedily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
it is very probable the people, forgetting the reſpect due to
perſons of their quality, would have affronted them, ſo much did they
ſlight his apology for an attempt, which was not only condemned by
them, but as it is ſaid, by all <hi>Europe,</hi> and even by the Pope himſelf.
The Duke of <hi>Boüillon</hi> paſſing about that time through <hi>Geneva,</hi> was
deſirous of being informed of all the circumſtances of the enterprize,
and went to ſee the places where they entred and made their efforts.</p>
               <p>In the mean time they of <hi>Geneva</hi> ſtrengthened by the Troops of
their Allies, and ſeveral <hi>French</hi> Soldiers both Horſe and Foot, whom
the King permitted to aſſiſt them, maintained themſelves againſt
the Garriſons with which they were ſurrounded, and drove away
them who approached their Walls; they cut down the Trees
about the City to take away all ſhelter for the Enemy, and made
ſeveral incurſions into the Countries of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and ſurprized the
City of S. <hi>Genis d' Aoſte,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Genis</hi> taken by ſurprize.</note> where they ſetled the Baron of <hi>Vilars</hi>
Governor, from whence they continually moleſted the Dukes Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and kept <hi>Chambery</hi> in exerciſe, marching many times up to
their Gates, and had it not been for the death of a valorous Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

that in his return home through <hi>Geneva,</hi> he ſhould aſſure the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
that he was not one of them who only love their friends whilſt
they advantage themſelves by them, and that he would never be
wanting to defend and protect them; he therefore deſired to know
of them the means they intended to uſe in making an offenſive War,
to the end that the ſuccours which he ſhould ſend them might be
profitably imployed. They received the Sieur of <hi>Vic</hi> with the
greateſt reſpect, and heard his general propoſals and particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances,
which tended rather to exhort them to a laſting peace
than a ſhort War. He was deſired to offer this to the Council, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there were ſeveral who judged that a War would be no leſs
conducing to the advancement of the publick Weal, than it had
been in the time of Duke <hi>Charles;</hi> that all who were intereſſed in
their preſervation would undoubtedly aſſiſt them; that ſeveral ſtout
men who were deſirous to ſhew their courage, would come and prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
their ſervice. <hi>De Vic</hi> on the contrary very elequently and truly
ſhewed them, that Peace was ſo neceſſary for them, and War ſo
pernicious, that there was an indiſpenſable neceſſity of choſing the
former, and avoiding the latter; that although the inducements to
War were ſpecious, and the means eaſie, yet were its effects never
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50836:87"/>
the leſs terrible, and the ſucceſs uncertain. That War in general
was profitable, and ought to be undertaken, when Peace could not
be procured; but that a well governed State which had ever thriven
by Peace,<note place="margin">1603.</note> ought not to ſet out in theſe ſtorms, nor to pleaſe it ſelf
in Warlike incounters with its Neighbours.<note place="margin">May.</note> In ſhort he prevailed ſo
far by his perſwaſions that they all inclined to Peace, provided it was
an honourable and profitable one, and ſo well ſetled as to take away
all occaſions of it for the future. Immediately after this there was
a Truce made, and this Treaty of Peace which was deemed ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
was for ſome time in agitation; but at length it broke off, the
<hi>Genevoiſes</hi> not being willing to accept it on any other terms but what
were honourable and advantagious. The Earl of <hi>Fuentes,</hi> the King
of <hi>Spains</hi> Lieutenant in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> hearing of the Treaty
which had been ended, ſent orders to <hi>Don Zanche de Luna</hi> Maſter of
his Camp to renew it, and bring it on again. He ſent for this purpoſe
a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain named <hi>Sebaſtien Culebro</hi> to <hi>Geneva,</hi> who having
obtained a ſafe-conduct, preſented himſelf to the Council, telling
them that the Earl of <hi>Fuentes</hi> having been informed of a Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
between the Deputies of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> which
yet had produced nothing; he had thereupon ſent an expreſs to <hi>Don
Zanche de Luna,</hi> enjoyning him to diſpatch a Captain to <hi>Geneva,</hi>
to deſire them of that City to think of Peace, and of the good reſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from it, openly declaring, that in caſe they did not agree with
the Duke, his <hi>Catholick</hi> Majeſty as his Highneſs's Ally, and having
his Country in protection, could do no leſs than aſſiſt him in this War.
And at the ſame time he delivered them the Original of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,

that they ſhould endeavour as ſoon as they can to comply with him,
becauſe that if it falls out otherwiſe, he will order his buſineſs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.

                  </q> The Terms of the <hi>Spaniſh Laconiſme</hi> are remarkable:

               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> foreſeeing that this War would not end
only amongſt them between whom it was begun, but that the
flame of it would break out farther, was deſirous to maintain Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom
in that Peace, for the ſake of which he had laid down his
Arms, at that time when they would have procured him great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:
wherefore his Ambaſſadors in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> by his order,
prepared the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Glaris, Baſle, Soleurre, Schaffonſe</hi> and <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel,</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:50836:87"/>
as them who were leaſt ſuſpected and intereſted for to be the
mediators of this accord. Which with much difficulty was at
length obtained. The <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> conſidering that the profits which
might redound from the War could not equal the damages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and that all their hopes of advantage by it depended on the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
from their Neighbours. That the hope which is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on a Foreign prop is uſually uncertain. That undoubtedly
the <hi>Catholick Cantons</hi> would not break off with the Duke upon
their account, and that being his Neighbours it was abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to come to ſome terms or other. Theſe reflections, and the
perſwaſions of their Allies, made the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> relent; ſo that
both Parties by degrees calmed their paſſions,<note place="margin">A Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Duke and <hi>Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> and laid down thoſe
Arms which they had taken up with ſo great an animoſity. The
Deputies from the five <hi>Cantons</hi> mediated this Peace at <hi>Remilly,</hi> and
it was concluded at S. <hi>Julien.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During all theſe ſeveral Journies backwards and forwards,
which theſe mediators of the Peace made from <hi>Geneva</hi> to S. <hi>Julien</hi>
which laſted a Month, the High-ways from the Bridge of <hi>Arve</hi> to
S. <hi>Julien</hi> were almoſt continually filled with People, eſpecially <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyards,</hi>
who paſſionately breathed after this Peace, and bleſſed the
Deputies who gave them hopes of it.<note place="margin">July 21.</note> So that immediately upon
the Signing of it at S. <hi>Julien,</hi> the Preſident <hi>Rochette</hi> put his Head
out of the Window of the Houſe where was held the Conference,
and cried out to theſe poor People who thronged the Streets, <hi>My
Friends, praiſe God, the Peace is concluded.</hi> Upon which they ſhouted
for Joy, and the Trumpets ſounded forth the publick gladneſs. This
Treaty of Peace may be ſeen deſcribed in the printed Book, called
<hi>The Citizen of</hi> Geneva.</p>
               <p>Both Parties having laid down their Arms, a while after they
began to combat with their Pens. <hi>Buttet</hi> Advocate of <hi>Chambery,</hi>
entered the Liſts,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Buttet</hi> writes a Book which he calls, <hi>The Cavalier of</hi> Savoy.</note> ſetting forth his <hi>Cavalier of Savoy,</hi> wherein he
deſcribed all his Highneſſes pretenſions on <hi>Geneva.</hi> It was debated
in Council whether this Book ought to be anſwered. They who
were for it, repreſented, that ſhould it not be done, the World
would be apt to believe that the Dukes Reaſons were well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Whereas they who were of the contrary opinion, alledged,
That in ſo doing they would expoſe their cauſe to the cenſures of
paſſionate Men, who being pre-poſſeſſed with prejudices, would
make uſe of their reaſons againſt them. The firſt advice was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
ſo that a learned Man of the Council,<note place="margin">

                  </note> a Perſon zealous for

or <hi>the Miſchief of the Ariſtocratical Government of</hi> Geneva;
theſe Books abound with ſharp invectives, and are good for nothing
but to renew former differences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philibert Blondel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1604.</note> who was <hi>Syndick</hi> in the Year when the attempt
of ſcaling <hi>Geneva</hi> was on foot,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Blondel</hi> his villanous actions.</note> had been ſeveral times cenſured in
the Council, and blamed by the People for having been ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
in ſecuring the City, although the principal <hi>Syndick</hi> had put
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50836:88"/>
him in mind of it the Night before the execution of their deſign,
according to the notice he had brought him of the Enemies march.
<hi>Blondel</hi> took it ill that he ſhould be ſuſpected, and had the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to complain thereof to the Council, pretending much zeal
for his Countries ſervice. His complaint ended in his confuſion,
for a Cutler, whoſe name was <hi>Guidonet,</hi> whom he had heretofore
ſollicited to be confederate with him in his Treachery, having a
quarrel with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could not ſuffer his Pride, and called him Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
before Witneſſes. <hi>Blondel</hi> taking it to heart, addreſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
thereupon to the Council, and obtains an order to impriſon
his Adverſaries; amongſt whom was <hi>Combe,</hi> who at length brought
ſuch proof, and alledged ſo many reaſons againſt <hi>Blondel,</hi> that at
length for his Neglect and Treaſons he was fined 2000 Crowns of
Gold; for the payment of which they ſeized on his Mills: yet
did he ſtill ſtand upon his juſtification: but the Witneſſes proved
again their Charge ſo clearly and fully againſt him, that he was
fined to pay 2000 Crowns of Gold more, and degraded from the
Council of 25. But he valued not the Mony, having gotten in a
ſhort time an Eſtate to the value of 40000 Crowns, no Body
knowing how: but he could not ſuffer his degradation with a quiet
mind. He reſolved thereupon rather to loſe his Head, than to lie
under this imputation. The buſineſs was ſo agitated, that at length
the truth was bolted out, it having been made apparent that he
held the Lordſhip of <hi>Compois,</hi> without paying any Taxes to the
Duke: that ſince the taking of <hi>Bonne</hi> he was obſerved to grow
rich on a ſuddain: that he had ſome private diſcourſe with a
Stranger the Night before the Walls were ſcaled; and that to avoid
the Officers depoſition, who had ſeen him, he had ſent the ſaid Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
to <hi>Genes,</hi> and given him a Horſe: that he being dead, <hi>Blondel</hi>
now thought himſelf ſecure; and that there was found a Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn
in the Ditch having his mark; and that a certain Perſon
from <hi>Cheſne</hi> brought him oftentimes Letters from the Governor of
<hi>Savoy.</hi> But this Article not being proved ſo clearly againſt him
as the others, he was ſentenced only to lie in Priſon for the ſpace
of ſeven Years, and to pay another Fine of 2000 Crowns. And
foraſmuch as the Perſons depoſition, who carried the Letters, was
the chief cauſe of this his Condemnation, he determined therefore
to ſend for this Peaſant, to try whether he could not make him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
what he had declared againſt him; he uſed ſuch means that
at laſt this poor fellow was clapt up in Priſon, where he offered
him a great ſumm of Mony to deny what he had before affirmed.
The Jaylor, whom <hi>Blondel</hi> had won by his gifts, brought him
word that he would not move a jot from his former depoſition:
whereupon <hi>Blondel</hi> offereth the Jaylor fifty Crowns to ſtrangle him
in the Night. Which being done, and the Magiſtrates coming the
next Morning to hear what this Witneſs had to ſay, found him
dead. The Phyſicians were called to ſearch him, and make their
report, that he had not killed himſelf, but had been ſtrangled by
ſome other. The Jaylor and Porter are thereupon apprehended;
the latter of which only was wont to viſit the Peaſant. He was
put on the Rack, and confeſſes the Fact, and perſiſts in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50836:88"/>
till death, namely, That what he had done, was at <hi>Blondel</hi>'s
inſtigation; who being convicted of the Murder, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the crime of High Treaſon, of which he was accuſed, was
put on the Rack. It was ſuppoſed that the ordinary torment
would not move him, wherefore he was put into an Engine made
of Wood, called the <hi>Beurriere,</hi> and had immediately <hi>Eſcarpins</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to him: but all theſe torments could not draw from him a
confeſſion of his being privy to the Enterprize of ſcaling the Walls;
but he owned the Murder, and that he had offered his Service to the
Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> But this was enough to deſerve death. He was
therefore condemned to be hanged and quartered: and was led to
be executed, without ſhewing any great remorſe. 'Tis reported
that he mentioned the Name of God but once, upon occaſion of
a Womans croſſing S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s place: for having uſed ſome great
injuſtice towards this Woman when he was <hi>Syndick,</hi> ſhe broke
out into this Imprecation, wiſhing <hi>that he might one time or other
receive as juſt a puniſhment, as that which he had impoſed on her had
been unjuſt:</hi> and he hearing her reproaching him with it at the
time he was leading to execution, he ſaid to her, holding up his
hands: <hi>Alas, pray to God for me, you ſee the miſerable condition I am
in.</hi> This was the end of this wretched Man.</p>
               <p>After this Execution the Walls were raiſed higher, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Watch-men was increaſed, and Paliſado's were drove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Ditches, and the City fortified that they might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
prepared againſt ſuch-like Enterprizes.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> diſpatched about that time the Baron of <hi>Luz</hi>
to be Governor of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Boiſſe</hi> to be Governor of <hi>Bourg,</hi>
and the Sieur <hi>de Nereſtan,</hi> for to deſire the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> to grant him
a place where he might build an <hi>Arſenal,</hi> to prevent the Cities
being in the like danger for the time to come. The Council was
divided. One part ſaid, <hi>That God ſhewed himſelf propitious to them
in ſending them a Foreign aſſiſtance of that importance, and that in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
of it, the Enemy would have no means left for making his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions.</hi>
Others oppoſed on the contrary, <hi>That the who had
ſuch aſſiſtance did thereby bring themſelves under an Obligation to them
from whom they received it: that perhaps this Arſenal might be given
in truſt to ſuch a Perſon, who by his liberalities, and winning behaviour
might gain the hearts of the Citizens, and dazle their eyes with the
brightneſs of Royalty:</hi> And farther, <hi>Perphaps all the Kings of</hi> France
<hi>would not be ſo candid in their intentions as</hi> Henry <hi>the Fourth, and then
it would be too late to repent.</hi> So that upon this different advice,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50836:89"/>
the Common-Council remitted the buſineſs to be determined by
the Council of 200, and they to the General-Council. Theſe

to be a Cornet in the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s Company, who was afterwards
<hi>Lewis</hi> the 13th.<note place="margin">1609.</note> But being a ſtout Man, he had a quarrel with a
Gentleman, whom he killed in his Majeſties ſight, who was then
at the Windows. Which obliged him to fly quickly out of <hi>France,</hi>
leſt he ſhould carry his head to <hi>Greve.</hi> He retired into <hi>Flanders</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Arch-duke's, where he was well received. He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
three Enterprizes to no effect, two on <hi>Berg op-zom,</hi> and the
other on <hi>L'ecluſe.</hi> Afterwards there being a Truce made in thoſe
Countries, he went on Pilgrimage to <hi>Lorette</hi> with a <hi>Bourdelois</hi>
called <hi>la Baſtide,</hi> a great Ingeneer. At their return paſſing through
<hi>Turin,</hi> they ſaluted the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who diſcovered to them
the deſire he had by ſome Enterprize to make himſelf Maſter of
<hi>Geneva.</hi> They ſet before him the means, and offered their ſervice,
which he accepted with great expreſſions of kindneſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
preſented <hi>du Terrail</hi> with 700 Ducatoons, and with a Ring
worth 300 Crowns of Gold; and gave to <hi>Baſtide</hi> 260 and Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,
injoyning them to go firſt to <hi>Geneva,</hi> and obſerve the State
of that City, and what Guard they kept there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>La Baſtide</hi> went to <hi>Geneva,</hi> and took an exact notice; and being
returned towards his Highneſs, gave him an account what alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
there had been made in the Fortifications of that City ſince
the Enterprize of ſcaling the Walls of it. Upon which the Duke
amended his ancient Platform; and they diſcourſed together on
their deſign. <hi>Du Terrail</hi> was for ſurprizing by a Petard, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
one of the Gates of <hi>Geneva. La Baſtide</hi> alledged it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
and too hazardous, conſidering the great number of Fences
which were before the Gates, and the ſtrict Watch kept at them.
That which was he propoſed was opproved of both by the Duke and
<hi>Terrail,</hi> which was to ſurprize the Gate leading to the Lake, where
there were no appointed Guards, and where, with a good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Soldiers making a deſcent, they might ſeize on the Gate of
<hi>Rive,</hi> and by this means become Maſters of the City without any
difficulty. It remained only to reſolve upon the manner. They
paſſed over then both of them from <hi>Evian</hi> to the Lake ſide, where
they remained eight days, informing themſelves, by the Boatmen
who frequented <hi>Geneva,</hi> of the diſpoſitions of the Watch-men, and
the ſearch made in Boats. They learned ſeveral defects, but to be the
more certain, <hi>La Baſtide</hi> paſſed over the Lake, and went to <hi>Morges,</hi>
where he imbarked himſelf in <hi>Genevoiſe</hi> Bark, and being brought
into the City, he obſerved the condition of the Port and the Gate
of <hi>Rive,</hi> and returned by Land. Being with the Duke, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
him of the ſucceſs of their undertaking, which was put off
to the end of <hi>May.</hi> They were to take along with them from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
five large flat-bottom Boats, and lade them with Wood, which
ſhould be piled after ſuch a ſort that 200 Soldiers might lie in
each Boat under theſe piles of Wood; with which lading they
might enter the Port without the leaſt ſuſpicion, and eaſily kill
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50836:90"/>
the Searchers, and ſeize on the Gate of <hi>Arve,</hi> and likewiſe let in
the Troops of Horſe, who were to lie ready near <hi>Geneva</hi> at an
appointed hour, and in the mean time they were to conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the Vallies on the ſide of <hi>Evian,</hi> which lies at a ſmall
diſtance from <hi>Geneva,</hi> together with ſome ſelect Soldiers who were
to be put into theſe Boats, who were not to be imbarked till a

               </p>
               <p>But this deſign could not be ſo privately carried on but the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevoiſes</hi>
got ſome intimations thereof, although they could not
dive into the bottom of it. The greateſt knowledge they had of
it was this:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Du Terrail</hi> having plaid at Tennis in <hi>Chambery</hi> till he
ſweated, whilſt he was rubbed and dried, <hi>la Baſtide</hi> and ſome
others preſented him a Paper, wherein was contained a draught
of <hi>Geneva,</hi> diſcourſing together ſoftly, as in matters of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance;
yet the Valet who warmed his Shirt, heard them talk
of <hi>Geneva,</hi> which made him give the greater attention; and he
comprehended they talked about ſome Enterprize deſigned againſt
it, having heard theſe words from <hi>Terrail: They are taken, there
is no remedy.</hi> This Valet, who had a Brother in <hi>Geneva,</hi> went and
reported this to a Merchant of that City, who was then at <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,</hi>
deſiring him to give his Brother notice, to the end he might
ſave himſelf from this danger. The Merchant at his return not
only advertiſed his Brother, but likewiſe the Magiſtrates, who
did not ſlight this warning,<note place="margin">1609.</note> yet they held it ſecret, and ſent Spies
throughout all <hi>Savoy</hi> to diſcover and pry into all <hi>Terrail</hi>'s practices.
They got his Picture, and having underſtood that he was coming
to <hi>Geneva</hi> to view the City, they ſent Tokens to ſeveral Perſons
how to know him, that he might be apprehended.</p>
               <p>Some days being paſt over, <hi>du Terrail</hi> and <hi>la Baſtide,</hi> having ſet

                  </note> they were diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
as they paſſed over the Mountains. Notice hereof was given
to the Bayliffs of the Countries belonging to <hi>Berne.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they ſuſpecting nothing, croſſed over the Lake and part of the
Country of <hi>Vaud,</hi> lodging only in Villages and Hamlets, and ſo
arrived at <hi>Yverdun</hi> a little City belonging to the <hi>Bernoiſes,</hi> which
lay on the borders of <hi>Franche-Comté</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Du Terrail,</hi> paſſing over the Bridge which leads into the City,
ſaluted the Bailiff, who met him, and took no notice of him: but
a Deacon, who was in his Garden, and to whom a <hi>Syndick</hi> had
ſent marks whereby he might know him, ſeeing him coming afar
off; ſaluted him, and doubting that he was the Perſon, he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
whether he was bald; which perceiving, he went immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Bayliff, and gave him notice of it, who ſent two Men
after him to watch which way they took their courſe, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them till they took up their abode. Which they did, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50836:90"/>
viewed them more nearly, compared them with their Pictures which
had been given them. One of theſe returned to <hi>Yverdun</hi> to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that they had taken up their Lodgings in the Village of <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beuf.</hi>
Whereupon immediately the Bailiff ſent four Troopers with
an Order to apprehend them by main force, and to bring them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
they found them ready to mount their Horſes, and brought
them back to <hi>Yverdun.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Terrail</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</note> 
                  <hi>Du Terrail</hi> told the Bailiff that his name
was <hi>Paul de Conſtans,</hi> and that he went to <hi>Lorrain</hi> to proſecute a ſuit
of Law: but the Bayliff took not this anſwer for payment; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he wrote to <hi>Geneva,</hi> to the end there might be ſome perſon ſent
who knew him; two Soldiers, one of whom had belonged to his
Company, were diſpatched to <hi>Yverdun,</hi> and were cauſed to come
into his Chamber when he was at Supper; the Souldier knew him
again: <hi>Du Terrail</hi> who ſuſpected the occaſion of his being there,
draws him aſide, and promiſes him a thouſand Crowns, if he would
go and advertiſe the Earl of <hi>Chamite</hi> in <hi>Franche Compté</hi> of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
he was in <hi>La Baſtide</hi> offered him a hundred more, but the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
refuſed both their proffers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Du Terrail</hi> being after this manner known, was committed to
priſon in the Caſtle of <hi>Yverdun;</hi> the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> deputed one of their
<hi>Syndicks</hi> to deſire the <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> to deliver them into their hands;
which was granted, and they were both conveyed to <hi>Geneva. La
Baſtide</hi> being firſt put on the Rack, confeſſed the whole deſign; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his confeſſion, he was confronted with <hi>Terrail,</hi> who at firſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
denied it, but ſeeing that <hi>Baſtide</hi> perſiſted in his confeſſion, and
he being threatned with the Rack likewiſe, with tears in his
eyes he confeſſed the whole project, and requeſted that he might
be ſhut up for ever between four Walls, hoping that his relations
would come and intercede for him, as indeed they did as ſoon as they
knew he was taken: but for reaſons of State, the Council quickly
diſpatched his Tryal, and condemned him to be beheaded at <hi>Molard,</hi>
two daies after <hi>La Baſtide</hi> was hanged.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>April</hi> 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Du Terrail</hi> was much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
for he was a perſon of a very good mien,<note place="margin">

In his going to the place of execution, he begged the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
pardon, and the people on the other hand wept bitterly for
him; ſome people blamed the Magiſtrates of <hi>Geneva</hi> for their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but they replied that they did not conſider them ſo much as
Enemies, but as authors of a Conſpiracy in a time of peace. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de L' Eſdiguieres,</hi> who had interceded for him and his relations,
were very much inraged at this execution. The firſt of theſe came
never after that into <hi>Geneva</hi> as he was wont, and his kindred were
made to believe that he had been forced to change his Religion; but
being informed of the contrary, they comforted themſelves the beſt
they could. This their deſign appeared very eaſie, which they were
reſolved to put in execution in the time when they of <hi>Geneva</hi> make a
King of the <hi>Harquebuze,</hi> becauſe then all the people are in <hi>Plein-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais,</hi>
and theſe Soldiers upon this occaſion might be taken for them
who belonged to the City, and it had been an eaſie matter to have
faſtned the Gates againſt them.</p>
               <p>The Republick ſuffered a great loſs by the death of <hi>Michael Roſet,</hi>

               <p>An <hi>Italian</hi> named <hi>Giovani</hi> coming from <hi>Rome,</hi>

certain honourable perſon of the Council was a Traytor, and that he
had ſeen his Picture in the Dukes Cloſet, which he could eaſily verifie.
When his Lord was brought to him whom they thought he meant,
he ſaid this was not the perſon; which cauſed him to be hanged as a
Calumniator and Impoſtor. It appeared afterwards that they had
been too raſh in their judgment, ſeeing there were two perſons of
the ſame name, one of which often frequented <hi>Savoy;</hi> the Attorney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general
required<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſatisfaction for this, and deſired that the Proceſs
might be proſecuted according to the form of the inſtructions which

               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth having been treacherouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſinated,

Deputy to the <hi>French</hi> Court, making it appear by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at <hi>Soleurre,</hi> that his Majeſty permitted his <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects to
aſſiſt <hi>Geneva</hi> both in their perſons and eſtates, this ſatisfied her. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that time arrived M. <hi>de Soubize</hi> of the houſe of <hi>Rohan,</hi> M. <hi>de Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thune</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi>'s nephew, the Sieur <hi>Deſmarets</hi> ſon to the wife

far from the Bullwarks of S. <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Pin,</hi> making trenches all

time in the City, and perceiving no act of hoſtility, every one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned

ſent immediately to them, offering, as good neighbours, to relieve

<hi>Item,</hi> That being arrived at <hi>Venice,</hi> they went and viſited the

fits, he had perſiſted in his blaſpemies againſt the Holy Trinity

His Body (according to his order) was carried to <hi>Geneva,</hi> for he
was a great lover of that City. He had taken up his abode there
a conſiderable time ſome years before: and it was he who made
the <hi>Mele</hi> in <hi>Plein-Palais.</hi> His Son <hi>Tancredus</hi> was placed by him
three or four years after, with an Epitaph which Madam of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi>

the ſeventeenth Article of that Treaty ought to be renewed from
time to time. Which was effected in the Year 1642, and was
ſolemnly ſworn to be obſerved in each of theſe Cities. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
from <hi>Switzerland</hi> were received by the Citizens in Arms,<note place="margin">1642.</note> a
Company of which went out of the City to meet them, all the
great Guns were diſcharged at their coming, and they were
ſumptuouſly entertained in the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> where at every Health they
drank, there was fired a Gun.</p>
               <p>We muſt not here forget a remarkable accident which hapned
two Years and a half after this; which was, That on Sunday the
19<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1645.</note> 1645. between ſeven and ten of the Clock in the
Morning, there aroſe ſuch a great Wind, that it drove back the
Water in the <hi>Rhoſne</hi> and Lake, ſo that for the ſpace of two hours
ſeveral Perſons paſſed over to the Chains upon the Land, and others
croſſed over from <hi>Monnoye</hi> to the <hi>Iſle:</hi> this Wind was ſo violent that
it carried away the Houſe-tops, blew down ſeveral Chimnies, and
plucked up Trees by the Roots; 'tis reported that it did two thouſand
Crowns damage as well in the Windows as Tiles of publick build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
Monſieur <hi>Calendrin</hi> hath mentioned it in a <hi>Latin</hi> Poem, which
is to be ſeen in the Works of Monſieur <hi>de Zuilichen.</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>it will not
be amiſs to clear a difficulty ſtated by Authors; which is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the</hi> Rhoſne <hi>paſſeth croſs the Lake without mingling its Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
with it? and whether its courſe can be diſcerned amidſt the
calm Waters of the Lake? Obſerve here what</hi> Marcellinus <hi>hath
wrote of it in the</hi> 15<hi>th Book of his</hi> Roman <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> Seeing, <hi>ſaith
he,</hi> we are led by our diſcourſe to theſe parts, it will not be amiſs to ſpeak
ſomething of the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> which is a moſt famous River: It takes its
riſe from the <hi>Alps,</hi> where ſeveral Fountains furniſh its Springs; and
from thence ſwiftly deſcending from a riſing ground, it runs into the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50836:95"/>
Lake; and croſſing it, doth not mingle its Waters with it: but paſſing
over the calm Waters of this Lake, makes way by its ſwiftneſs: and by
this means loſing none of its depths, pierceth through the thickeſt of its
ſtreams, and diſ-intangling it ſelf, ſlides to the borders of the <hi>Sequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſes,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>Several of our Moderns have followed this ancient Author; and
others have reputed this his account fabulous.<note place="margin">1645.</note> But this is the truth
which I have learned of ſeveral Perſons who dwell near the Lake,
and who have often paſſed from one ſide of it to the other. The
<hi>Rhoſne</hi> coming into the Lake with great ſwiftneſs, runneth about
half an hour or more without confounding her Waters with it,
diſtinguiſhing it ſelf by its gray colour: but near <hi>Vevay, Laurane,
Rolle</hi> and <hi>Nyons,</hi> that is to ſay, almoſt all the length of the Lake,
the <hi>Rhoſne</hi> cannot be diſtinguiſhed by its colour nor motion, every
part being equally calm and of the like colour. 'Tis certain that
for about two Leagues from <hi>Copel</hi> to <hi>Geneva,</hi> the bottom of the
Lake beginning to riſe higher, it beginneth therefore towards the
middle to ſlide ſoftly, to diſcharge it ſelf of the Waters of the
<hi>Rhoſne,</hi> and other Rivulets which it hath received into its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.</p>
               <p>The ſwiftneſs of the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1645.</note> before it enters into the Lake, is
the occaſion of a rarity hapning in Winter in that place, which
is, That only the bottom of the River freezes: and the reaſon of
this is obvious, becauſe the bottom of it being ſtill, is by that means
ſooner ſeized on by the cold: whereas the ſurface of it is in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
agitation, and renewed by a perpetual ſucceſſion of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.<note place="margin">

as far as <hi>Lyons,</hi> and ſo that the Sovereignty of <hi>Chanſy</hi> and
<hi>Avoully,</hi> which are Ports belonging to the King, although ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

was of no value to him, bringing him in no profit. The
King deſirous to gratifie them,<note place="margin">1661.</note> remitted it to them by his Letters,
but the worſt of it was, That theſe Letters were never atteſted in
Parliament, and ever ſince they have exerciſed Sovereignty over
theſe two Villages, and even in the Year 1675. they put to death
a Malefactor at <hi>Chanſy.</hi> I ſpecifie this not only for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
the Biſhops pretenſions, but likewiſe upon the account
of another affair, which lies at this preſent before the King, which
ſhall be mentioned in is place. To return then to the Year 1661.
<hi>John Lullin</hi> was diſpatched immediately to <hi>Paris,</hi> but before he
could come there, the Biſhop had already obtained, by ſurprize, a

was ſuch care taken, that the Intendant deferred to perform it,
it having been repreſented to him, That the States Deputies were
at Court upon that occaſion, and that if they could not get that
Decree repealed, yet might it be put ſoon enough in execution.
<hi>Lullin</hi> having ſollicited his buſineſs for the ſpace of two Years in

their Deputies to meet him out of the City, and three or four
Companies of trained Bands ſtood ready to welcom him. The Council
went to complement him, and preſented him with Wine and
Trouts. But he ſtaying no longer with them than Dinner-time,
the City could not ſhew him as they deſired, the affection they had
to do the King ſervice. In parting thence he paſſed through two Files
of the City Trained Bands, which reached from his Houſe where
he refreſhed himſelf, as far as the new Gate, beyond which there

and took their leave of him: he ſeemed to be very well pleaſed
with his entertainment.</p>

<hi>Geneva.</hi> The <hi>Savoyards</hi> who would not acknowledge that they had
broke the League, becauſe the <hi>Switzers</hi> were the undertakers or ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for it, made anſwer, that his was not a Fort, ſeeing it had no Dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
it being only a Magazin, wherein they would lay their Salt,
which was wont to be carried by Water through <hi>Geneva;</hi> but now
they would Tranſport it in Carts by Land from <hi>Seiſſel</hi> to <hi>Bellerive,</hi>
the Bridge of <hi>Trembieres</hi> having been made for that purpoſe; and
that the Veſſels they had built were only deſigned to carry the Salt
which they uſually ſent to <hi>Chablais, Valais, Fribourg,</hi> and ſeveral
other <hi>Cantons,</hi> for moſt of the <hi>Switzers</hi> have alwaies brought their
Salt by the way of <hi>Geneva:</hi> and indeed the building at <hi>Bellerive,</hi> and
the Boats there have not yet been uſed to any other purpoſe than
what they mentioned. But the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> in ſo dangerous times,
ſuſpected all theſe pleas, and imagined there lay ſome deſign concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
under this pretence, as knowing that the Magazin and the Boats
might be fitted out for War in two daies time: and theſe were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the <hi>Savoyards</hi> preparations for War.</p>
               <p>Yet were not the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> aſleep all this while, ſo many Soldiers
lying near them, and the Dukes Subjects continually threatning
them, beſides the notice given them from all parts, put them out of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50836:98"/>
doubt, that the Duke had a deſign againſt them; yet they imagined
that it was not likely the Duke would openly beſiege them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſet upon them by ſurprize, whether by day or in the night they
could not tell; being perhaps encouraged by ſome private intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
which he might have in the City,<note place="margin">The <hi>Genevoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> fortifie the City.</note> which made the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi>
take all poſſible care to ſecure their Gates and Walls. They increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
their Garriſon, by an addition of ten men to each company, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the uſual guard of Citizens, thirty of which were joyned with
the Garriſon every night, and were not relieved till the next evening
by a like number; the Grand rounds ſet forth every quarter of an
hour, beſides the uſual Watch, the four Beadles belonging to the
Council of two hundred, and the two Majors, who never failed to
perform their Office in their own perſons; and by this means the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels
had no opportunity to ſleep: the Watch who lay without the
City were reinforced, and ſome placed in Boats on the Lake. For
better ſecurity in the day time, the Sentinels were doubled, and they
who ſtood on the Draw-Bridge were enjoyned to wear Breaſt-plates
to prevent Poynarding; there were new Percullices fitted to the
Gates, and other machins to prevent ſurpriſals, and new Barrs or
Palliſado's a hundred paces diſtant from them. All the Hedges and
Trees were cut down within a Musket ſhot of the City Gates, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
thoſe towards the Gates of <hi>Rive,</hi> to the end there might be
made a clearer diſcovery of thoſe who ſhould approach them: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the perſons whoſe Office was to watch at the Gates, there
were others appointed by the Council of two hundred (called <hi>Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles)</hi>
to ſearch all ſtrangers whether they were armed. The Hay-Carts
were likewiſe pierced, to find if any perſon was hid therein;
and ſeveral other ſuch like precautions. At the Chains which went
croſs the Lake, there ſtood a guard of Citizens; the Chains were
always extended, neither were the Boats ſuffered to paſs till the
Guard belonging to the Port had ſearched them at <hi>Nilons</hi> Stone, and
had given the ſign that there was no danger.</p>
               <p>Moreover every Houſe-keepers arms were viewed, and every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was obliged according to his ability to furniſh himſelf with
Corn, Powder and Bullet, and all things elſe that were neceſſary.
It was ordered that every Citizen ſhould wear a Sword, and that all
Merchants and Tradeſmen ſhould continually have their arms lying
ready by them in their Shops, to the end they might be in readineſs
on the firſt occaſion. Two hundred of the wealthieſt Citizens were
obliged to keep each of them an able Horſe, beſides others which are
kept commonly in the City. There were ſeveral ſtrangers, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>French</hi>-men, quartered on the reſt of the Citizens who came from
all parts to offer their ſervice to the City, and M. <hi>de Balthazard</hi> the
Quarter-Maſter-General, offered to command the Horſe.</p>
               <p>In the mean time there was care taken to ſend ſeveral Spyes into
<hi>Savoy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Spies ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Savoy.</hi>
                  </note> but eſpecially in thoſe places where the Troops lay, to the
end they might have notice of their motions; and that their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
might not be divulged, there was ſetled a private Council,
which conſiſted only of ſeven choſen men, who had full power in all
Caſes unleſs of extraordinary importance, for ſuch matters were
brought before the general Council.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:50836:98"/>
In <hi>Switzerland,</hi> they of <hi>Zurich</hi> and <hi>Berne</hi> raiſed a conſiderable
number of Soldiers to aſſiſt <hi>Geneva,</hi> and to the end they might not be
burdenſom to the City before they had need of them; they were
quartered in the Cities and Boroughs near the Lake, that ſo they
might be in a readineſs in a ſhort time at <hi>Geneva,</hi> when occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
by means of a ſign which they had agreed upon. The <hi>Bernoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
moreover cauſed two great Gallies to be made, which were able
to hold two hundred men a piece. The <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> likewiſe built a
great one. Monſieur <hi>Joffery</hi> called <hi>du Torrent</hi> hath been ſince made
Commander of theſe Veſſels, one of which carried fourteen, and the
other ten caſt Guns.</p>
               <p>This is the neareſt account of the preparations on both ſides, which
yet ſerved to no purpoſe. It is almoſt impoſſible to imagine how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
and well diſpoſed the <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> were to receive their Enemies,
ſeveral of them being troubled that the <hi>Savoyards</hi> ſhould remain all
this while armed, and yet not declare a War; and indeed it is ſtrange
that the Duke ſhould maintain ſuch conſiderable Forces about <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi>
during eight or nine months time, it being unknown for what
end: it is likely he had ſome deſign on the <hi>Genevoiſes,</hi> but their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
and watchfulneſs hindred it.</p>
               <p>We muſt not here forget how chearfully the people in general
laboured at the fortifications,<note place="margin">The diligence of the people in working at the Fort.</note> all the Corporations of Merchants,
Artiſts, and other profeſſions ſtrived to out-do one another, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
round the City with a Drum beating to ſhew themſelves. The
Students, and Divinity-Profeſſors, went before them with four
Drums, every man endeavouring to exceed his companion; they
thought it not enough to work themſelves, but brought workmen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them, one man ten, and another twenty; there was a rich
<hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant then at <hi>Geneva,</hi> who brought a long with him two
hundred workmen.</p>
               <p>In the mean time there was carried on a kind of Proceſs or Law-ſuit
between <hi>Savoy, Geneva,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, which was
managed before the Confederates, upon account at firſt of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
difference, which yet had given occaſion to all this
buſtle.</p>
               <p>In the Month of <hi>March,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Savoyards</hi> and <hi>Genevoiſes</hi> at variance about their priviledges.</note> in the Year 1667. The Curates of <hi>Meg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
and of <hi>Choulex,</hi> gave the Sacrament to a ſick perſon lying in a
houſe at <hi>Courſinge,</hi> which depended on the Soveraignty of <hi>Juſſy,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the reſt of the Village belonged to <hi>Savoy.</hi> The State ſent the
elder Syndick <hi>Colladon</hi> to be informed further of the matter, who
cites theſe Curates to appear on ſuch a day. The Senate of <hi>Chambe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
on the other ſide cite <hi>Colladon</hi> to make his perſonal appearance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, and publiſh a Declaration againſt him by beat of Drum,
with an Order to have him apprehended that he might have his Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
The Council marveiling at this proceeding, ſent the Syndick
<hi>Liffort</hi> to <hi>Chambery</hi> to the chief Preſident of <hi>La Perouſe</hi> Commandant
in <hi>Savoy,</hi> to make their complaints to him, and to ſhew him their
Title, and to juſtifie their right of Soveraignty over that Houſe; but
he refuſed to peruſe it, and to hear their reaſons; which put the Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicks
and Council to ſend Deputies into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> who made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
journeys to the Dyets of <hi>Arau</hi> and <hi>Baden,</hi> where the Baron of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50836:99"/>
                  <hi>Greiſy</hi> the Ambaſſador from <hi>Savoy</hi> alledged his reaſons: he publiſhed
a <hi>Factum,</hi> which was anſwered by another. At length towards the
latter part of the year the State deputed <hi>André Pictet,</hi> and <hi>John Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan</hi>
to <hi>Turin,</hi> to end this difference with his Highneſs himſelf; who
cauſed them to be received and treated with much civility and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
in all his Dominions; but the Marquiſs of <hi>Pianezze,</hi> and other
Commiſſaries whom the Duke had appointed to regulate this affair,
uſed ſuch delays, that the Deputies were forced to tarry three
Months at <hi>Turin</hi> without concluding any thing. At length the King
wrote a Letter to the Lords of <hi>Geneva,</hi> which was brought by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
of <hi>Lionne:</hi> and M. of <hi>Servient</hi> his Majeſties Ambaſſador at <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>
deſired the Deputies for his Maſters ſake, and to preſerve the
peace, they would releaſe this houſe at <hi>Courſinge,</hi> which they
did.</p>
               <p>They were yet at <hi>Turin,</hi> and the Forces of <hi>Savoy</hi> were ſtill in the
field,<note place="margin">City divided.</note> whilſt a matter hapned at <hi>Geneva,</hi> which lacked but little of
ruining it: for the Council of twenty five, and the Council of two
hundred could not agree, but were divided, which difference laſted
all Sunday being the 7. of <hi>December.</hi> I would here relate all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of it, but it having been ordered to be ſcratched out of the
Council Regiſters, to the end that it might be for ever forgotten: it
will be ſufficient to ſay that <hi>John Sarraſin</hi> the Auditor, having preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Council of two hundred in the <hi>Syndicks</hi> abſence, and over
the Council of twenty five, the leſſer Council committed him to
Priſon, and ſet a guard over him belonging to the Garriſon. The
Council of two hundred not being able to endure that he ſhould be
uſed as a Criminal, who had been guilty of no other fault but of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their head, reſolved to releaſe him by force; finding themſelves
backed by all the people who were aſſembled at S. <hi>Peters,</hi> where
the two hundred ſat in Council. The leſſer Council who had the
Garriſon on their ſide, would not endure to be impoſed upon. At
length when they were juſt ready to fall upon one another, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
was diſcharged, and all things quieted.</p>
               <p>On the 27. of <hi>Jan.</hi> at night 1670.<note place="margin">1670.</note> there hapned a fire amongſt
the Houſes on the Bridge of <hi>Rhoſne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A fire on the Bridge of <hi>Rhoſne.</hi>
                  </note> which being all Timber-Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
the greateſt part of them were burnt down in leſs than two hours
ſpace, ſix ſcore perſons periſhing in the flames. A Miller choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſave his Mother than his Wife, but ſhe followed after in a rage,
wading in the water up to her chin, and eſcaped; another Woman
who lay ſick, and was to take Phyſick the next morning, caſt her ſelf
out at the window, and recovered both her life and health in the
<hi>Rhoſne;</hi> having had the good hap to eſcape out of the water after ſhe
had ſhunned the fire. In ſhort this Conflagration had done more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
had it not been ſtopped by the Towers of <hi>Monnoye</hi> and of the
<hi>Iſle</hi> which ſerved as barrs againſt the flames; and it is obſervable that
ſeveral pieces of Timber kept burning in the water, ſo great was the
violence of the flames: but that which was more ſtrange, and which
all the inhabitants beheld, was that the Channel of <hi>Rhoſne</hi> between
the Iſle and the City, which contained two hundred ſixty five foot in
breadth, was filled and dried up by the ruins of the Houſes; <hi>The other</hi>
Channel, although commonly running very ſwift, and ſwelled by the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50836:99"/>
overflowings of <hi>the other,</hi> yet four days after was frozen up. There
were collections made for the relief of thoſe families who were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers
by this fire. There were ſix thouſand Crowns gathered for
them of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and the <hi>Bernoiſes</hi> made liberal contributions.</p>
               <p>The Prince Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> came to <hi>Geneva</hi> in the Year 1671.<note place="margin">1671.</note> and
ſtayed there ſome Months;<note place="margin">The Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained at <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </note> he came there in the Evening, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had not ſuch reception as was intended: but the City being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of their obligations to that family, during his abode in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he had all the reſpect they were able to ſhew him. But that
which appeared moſt conſiderable, was his entertainment on the
Lake; for the great Gally was fitted out and manned by the flower
of the Youth of the City: <hi>M.</hi> the Prince was received on Board
her with part of the Council. All the Morning was ſpent in the ſport
of fiſhing, when at Noon they landed at <hi>Secheron,</hi> and went to the
Caſtle of <hi>Roſet</hi> to eat the large Trouts they had taken; there was a
ſtately dinner provided and made ready for them, where the Prince
was attended by the ſons of perſons of quality belonging to the City,
and the Lords of the Council, by the Princes Gentlemen. After Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they walked forth on the Lakes ſide, the Cannons which thundred
from the Gally were anſwered by the Drums and Trumpets, from the
Boats which were to the number of thirty attending on the Gally:
there was nothing thought of but mirth and divertiſement, when on a
ſuddain there appeared a Frigate, having fifty Moors on Board her,
and an <hi>Algerine</hi> Flag on her main top. Whereupon immediately all
the people made ready to fight, and ſeveral Guns diſcharged on both
ſides, and at length they came to boarding; but in the end the <hi>Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
was vanquiſhed, there being good reaſon for it, and the Captain
of the Frigate came to Complement the Prince. At laſt they returned
into the City towards the Evening, but the night was kept off a while
by the light of the Cannon, which were diſcharged from all the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
of the City, and other places along the Port. Some weeks after,
the Prince fell dangerouſly ſick of the ſmall Pox, and Prayers were
made for his recovery in all the Churches, which at length obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he ſet out for <hi>Grenoble,</hi> being very well ſatisfied with his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
at <hi>Geneva.</hi> The Citizens and the Garriſon appeared in their
arms, for to do him honour, and the Council accompanied him, and
the Cannons were not ſilent in this occaſion.</p>
               <p>It is not above ſix years ſince an enterprize was diſcovered on <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1673.</note>
which hath been known to few.<note place="margin">An account of another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for the taking of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by its Author.</note> In the year 1673. on a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
day in <hi>September,</hi> the chief <hi>Syndick</hi> found at his Houſe (at
his return from Church) a Letter which a perſon unknown had left
in his abſence; the Contents whereof were, That upon a Proviſo of
a proportionable reward, he would make ſuch a conſiderable diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
that the publick ſafety depended on it, and if they deſired to
ſpeak with this perſon next morning about it, the Superiour of the
Convent of the <hi>Capuchines</hi> of <hi>Gex</hi> would inform them where he was;
but if they neglected this advertiſement, they might be certain of
finding the City in a ſhort time reduced to the greateſt extremity.
Wherefore the Council failed not to ſend the next Morning the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat
<hi>Dunant</hi> to <hi>Gex,</hi> who diſcourſed this unknown perſon in the
<hi>Capuchin</hi>'s garden, and dexterouſly drew from him part of the ſecret:
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50836:100"/>
he learnt that what he had to diſcover was an enterprize againſt the
City, the particulars whereof he might well diſcover, ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was the Author of it; that having conceived ſome diſtaſte-againſt
the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> he was reſolved to diſcover the deſign; but firſt
deſired to be rewarded with a thouſand pounds, and that he might
have a place where he might live ſecure. <hi>Dunant</hi> replied, that he
had no power to treat with him about that particular; and that it
would be more convenient for him to come to <hi>Geneva,</hi> where he
might more eaſily treat with the Council about it in his own perſon.
And whereas he deſired to have a Letter of ſafe-conduct, he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, that this was not their Cuſtom, but that he had power gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him to engage the Publick Faith upon it; and that he might
come into the City with the ſame ſurety, as others had done before
him. This perſon was contented with this, and came the next
morning and preſented himſelf before the Council at <hi>Geneva,</hi> telling
them that his name was <hi>John Baptiſte Noroy,</hi> of <hi>Nozeray</hi> in <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi>
that having found out an eaſie way to ſurprize <hi>Geneva,</hi> he had
paſſed over into <hi>Piedmont</hi> ſome months ſince for to make it known
to the Duke, which he did in a long conference he had with him at
<hi>Rivoles,</hi> in which the Duke told him amongſt other things that he
had a ſcore of Penſionaries in <hi>Geneva,</hi> four or five of which were of
the Council; that ſome days after his Highneſs ſaid, that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
the matter and found it too difficult, and moreover this jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of time was not proper to enter into a War; yet he thanked
him for his good will, and had at the time ten pieces given him: and
to make it appear that what he ſaid was true, he produced Letters
from the Dukes Secretary, and from ſome Lords belonging to the
Court.</p>
               <p>His project was to be effected in the time of Vintage-harveſt, at
which ſeaſon a great part of the Citizens are in the fields, and to ſend
on ſeveral daies, and through ſeveral Gates, under divers pretences,
four or five hundred men without Arms, who as faſt as they came,
ſhould have their lodgings prepared for them in the Houſes of their
Confederates, where they were to be furniſhed with Arms, and lie
hid till the day of the execution of their enterprize, which was to
be in Sermon time about eight of the Clock; all theſe people who
were hid coming out with their Arms, were to divide themſelves
into ſeveral parties, three of which conſiſting of about 80 men a
piece, ſhould ſpeedily ſeize on all the doors of the three Churches, and
not only hinder the people from coming out, but in the fright would
conſtrain them to get up upon the top of the Churches, and by this
means there would be no place needing a guard but only the Steeple
ſtairs: another company ſhould ſcour the ſtreets, and kill the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
who being not at Church would come out of their Houſes to
rally themſelves; the reſt were to ſet upon a certain Gate of the City,
which being not ſuccoured by any Citizens would be ſoon won;
which done, there ſhould be let in Forces who were to march all
night, that they might be at the Gates at the hour of this execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He added that he was moved to make this diſcovery for two
reaſons, Firſt that the Duke had given him but ten pieces, which he
took as a great undervaluing of him; and Secondly, that having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50836:100"/>
to be made governour of <hi>Geneva</hi> when it ſhould be taken, his
Highneſs inſtead of promiſing him it, ſet to ſcoffing at him.</p>
               <p>He was earneſtly deſired to declare the names of thoſe perſons who
were Penſionaries to the Duke, but he ſolemnly proteſted he knew
them not, and that it might be eaſily imagined that his Highneſs
would not diſcover to him a ſecret of that importance before it was
time. They who judged charitably of their fellow Citizens, could
not believe there could be any ſo wicked, and that this was but an
artifice to raiſe ſuſpicions in the people againſt ſome of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</p>
               <p>The leſſer Council after they had heard him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Novoy</hi> ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> ſent him to Priſon to
ſecure him, and the next morning the Council of two hundred were
aſſembled, before whom the whole matter was opened; they were
not a little perplexed in their reſolves about this man, ſome would
have him ſet at liberty, ſeeing the Publick Faith was engaged for
him, although but in words; others were of opinion to put him on
the Rack to make him diſcover the Traytors, this being a matter
wherein the ſecurity of the City was concerned; others would have
have him put to death, conſidering the apparent danger there was
in ſetting at liberty a man of this diſpoſition, that he had not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
his deſign out of any good motive, but only out of ſpite and
for money; and that moreover the Publick Faith was not engaged
by the promiſe which was made him, <hi>that he might come with the ſame
ſecurity as others before him,</hi> theſe terms being very general and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous,
ſeeing that by the laſt of theſe forementioned words might
be underſtood, that he might come with the ſame ſurety, as other
ſuch like enterprizers had done before him, who were put to death
when they could be taken. In the mean time the greateſt number
of voices carried it, who were for avoiding both extreams; to wit,
to ſave his life, and to condemn him to perpetual impriſonment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which ſentence he ſtill lies.</p>
               <p>The two Princes <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>George</hi> brethren to <hi>Charles Landgrave</hi>

death, becauſe that this Family holds a conſiderable rank amongſt
<hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and hath ever expreſſed a particular affection to <hi>Geneva.</hi>
The Council having waited upon Prince <hi>Philip,</hi> and the Prince now
reigning, ordered that for three days there ſhould be an intermiſſion
of all publick buſineſs, to teſtifie thereby their ſorrow and reſpect;
and becauſe that Prince <hi>Philip</hi> would have his brothers body buried
amongſt his Anceſtors at <hi>Caſſel,</hi> it was therefore embalmed, and laid
in S. <hi>Peters</hi> Chappel, where lies buried <hi>Emilia</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> till the time

was conveyed to the Chappel with great ſolemnity, being carried

               <p>About this time there hapned ſome differences with <hi>Savoy</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Salt. The principal Farmers who have the Farming of the Salt
of <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1675.</note> 
                  <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> that is to ſay, the only permiſſion to

but their time being expired in the Year 1675. There was a
greater price required of them, but they reſolved to give no more
than heretofore, and ſo they held it no longer; this ſo greatly
moved them that they determined to reſent it when occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Savoy</hi> they would have taxed the quantity of Salt which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Subject of <hi>Geneva</hi> within the limits of <hi>Savoy</hi> ought to take,<note place="margin">

upon ſending ſix Waggons loaden with Salt in the night to <hi>Juſſy,</hi>
with a guard of twenty Soldiers for to keep up their priviledge in
that matter; this made a great noiſe in <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Regent wrote to
the Ambaſſador in <hi>France,</hi> and to the leſſer <hi>Cantons</hi> in very ſharp
terms againſt the <hi>Genevoiſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1675.</note> whom he charged with making an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion,
and entring in an Hoſtile manner by night into her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.<note place="margin">In Autum.</note>
The minor <hi>Cantons,</hi> and the Kings Embaſſador in <hi>Switzerland,</hi>
wrote to <hi>Zurich</hi> and <hi>Berne,</hi> and they to <hi>Geneva.</hi> Information was
ſent them of the whole matter, and they approved of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of them of <hi>Geneva,</hi> promiſing them aſſiſtance in caſe of a rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
wherewith the <hi>Savoyards</hi> threatned the City. The Militia of
<hi>Savoy</hi> conſiſting of eight hundred Gentlemen having been command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be in readineſs; and there were frequent Muſters made, and
great quantity of Arms and proviſion brought into <hi>Savoy,</hi> which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them of <hi>Geneva</hi> to ſtand upon their guard.</p>
               <p>A while after the City received a Letter from the King,<note place="margin">1676.</note> by the
hands of Monſieur <hi>de Gravelle,</hi>

afterwards, and fully refuted whatſoever he had alledged; at length
they returned very well ſatisfied at their journey. This buſineſs hath
layn dormant all this while, yet hath the City been acquainted by
Monſieur <hi>de Pompone,</hi> that Madam <hi>Royalle</hi> remains as yet very much
diſcontented at the Tranſportation of Salt to <hi>Juſſy</hi> through her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,<note place="margin">July 18.</note>
and requires ſtill ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>The ſame Farmers did the like in <hi>France</hi> as they had done in <hi>Savoy,</hi>

               <p>IT is a common Opinion in <hi>Geneva,</hi> that in the time of <hi>Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,
Apollo</hi> was particularly worſhipped, and that he had a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in this City in the ſame place where now ſtands S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Church. There is to be ſeen, on a Gate behind this Church, a
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50836:103"/>
Head made to reſemble that of the Sun. Monſieur <hi>Morus</hi> alledgeth
this proof in his Harangue <hi>de Sole &amp; ſcuto Genevenſi,</hi> for to confirm
the common opinion. But this Head ſeems to me to be nothing
elſe but the Carvers fancy, and doth not look as if it was very
old, it being made only of <hi>Molaſſe</hi> Stone. Being ſome Years ſince
at <hi>Geneva</hi> with Monſieur <hi>Patin,</hi> who is a competent Judge in theſe
matters, I ſhewed him this piece, and he was of opinion that it
was not very old. Neither do I believe with others, that this part
of the Church, near which ſtands the fore-mentioned Head, is the
remains of a <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Temple, ſeeing there is not to be ſeen any
difference in the other parts of it, neither in its Frame nor Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials.
But this Temple might perhaps have been built on the
Foundations of that of <hi>Apollo.</hi>

of Bondage, adding thereunto ſome Surname, as this <hi>Cajus Julius

of <hi>Lucius Aurelius Reſpectus</hi> a learned young Man, who had
twice pleaded at the Bar, although but eighteen years of age, as
his Father <hi>Lucius Aurelius Reſpectus</hi> teſtifies of him. The Son is

The one lying on the Eaſt-ſide of the Lake, and the other on the

               <p>THis Inſcription was made for a Monument of a Father and
his Son, who were of the Family of the <hi>Plinies,</hi> which was
Illuſtrious under the Empire of <hi>Trajan</hi> and his Succeſſors: we muſt
read the Fathers thus, <hi>Caio Plinio Marci Filio Caii Nepoti Fauſto
Aedili Duumviro</hi> (Coloniae) <hi>Juliae Equeſtris, Flamini, Caius Plinius
Fauſtus vivos,</hi> or <hi>vivus ſibi fecit.</hi> So that he raiſed this Monument
himſelf, when his Son <hi>Lucius Plinius Sabinus</hi> being but twelve years
of age died. Some who underſtood not this word E Q. have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
it <hi>Equiti</hi> a Knight: which it cannot ſignifie, for it would
have been placed immediately after the name, and before the other
qualities; and moreover the <hi>Ediles,</hi> or they who had the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendance
over publick Buildings, were not choſen from amongſt
the Knights, but the People. And in effect what would IVL. ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie.
As for the word <hi>Coloniae</hi> it is underſtood, as in the name of
<hi>Corinthe,</hi> which hath been called heretofore <hi>Colonia Latina Julia Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus,</hi>
and ſometimes <hi>LAVS IVLIA CORINTHVS:</hi> for
the name of <hi>Jules</hi> hath been given to ſeveral Colonies which have
been ſent over in his time, or favoured by him, as without doubt
the Colony of <hi>Equeſtres</hi> were. What I have ſaid of this Colony
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50836:109"/>
may be ſeen in <hi>Munſter, p.</hi> 23. <hi>T.</hi> 1. <hi>Guilliman,</hi> and the Author of
the Book called the <hi>Citizen,</hi> thought that the Colony of <hi>Equeſters</hi>
was <hi>Geneva,</hi> or at leaſt that it was the Capital, and that <hi>Chablais</hi> had
taken its name from <hi>Caballis,</hi> or <hi>Equis;</hi> and that which hath inclined
them to be of this Opinion, is the great number of Inſcriptions
which are to be ſeen in <hi>Geneva,</hi> where there is mention made of it.
<hi>Guichenon</hi> hath very well judged, that they might have been
brought from ſome other place, and I have read in the Manuſcripts,
that thoſe two which are at <hi>Molard,</hi> where there is made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a <hi>Sextumvir</hi> of the <hi>Equeſtres,</hi> and of a Citizen of the ſame
Country, had been brought from <hi>Verſoy,</hi> in the Year 1590. and
likewiſe another Inſcription wherein is mentioned <hi>Civitas Equeſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
is cited in Authors who have written of the Country of <hi>Vaud,</hi>
as if it had been heretofore to be ſeen there. It is likewiſe very
probable, by the right of Neighbourhood, that ſeveral Perſons of
Quality who had Offices in the Colony of <hi>Equeſters,</hi> had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the ſame in <hi>Geneva,</hi> or at leaſt that they had died in that City.</p>
               <p>The true ſituation then of this Colony was in the Country of
<hi>Vaud,</hi> betwixt the two ſmall Rivers of <hi>Verſoy</hi> and <hi>Aubonne,</hi> and
the word <hi>Enqueſtres,</hi> which is uſed ſtill in this Territory amongſt
the People of that Country,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Guichenon</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Savoy,</hi> p. 8.</note> is a ſufficient proof of this. There
is likewiſe an ancient Act made in the Year 1011. wherein this
ſmall Country along the Lake is called <hi>Pagus Equeſtricus. Nions,</hi>
which was in the middle, was the Capital City, which was the
occaſion that this name was added, as in the Notes of the Empire,
written in <hi>Theodoſius</hi> his time, it is called <hi>Civitas Equeſtrium No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viodunum</hi>
under the Province of the <hi>Sequanoiſes,</hi> in which likewiſe
<hi>Pliny</hi> placeth it, whereas <hi>Geneva</hi> was comprehended under the
Province of <hi>Vienna.</hi> The Itinerary of <hi>Antoninus</hi> diſtinguiſheth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well <hi>Geneva,</hi> which he calls <hi>Civitas Genavenſium,</hi> under the
Province of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and <hi>Nions Civitas Equeſtrium, id est, Nevidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
under the <hi>Sequanoiſe</hi> Province, the ſame with that above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.

For a confirmation of what I have ſaid, I ſhould have
added, That there has been found an ancient Coyn, which hath
on one ſide CIVITAS EQVESTRIS, and on the other SEDES

               <p>This likewiſe may ſerve to convince us of the popular error which
taketh a row of ſtakes which appear above water in the Lake, for the
remains of this Bridge; for it doth not face the <hi>Helvetians</hi> Country,
but the Country of <hi>Chablais,</hi> which then belonged to the <hi>Allobroges;</hi>
and it being a hard matter to root out opinions which have ſunk deep
into peoples minds, I ſhall therefore make bold to relate here the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
made by a friend of mine, to whom I am obliged for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Memoires relating to this preſent Hiſtory. Be pleaſed then to
obſerve what he hath written to me thereof.</p>
               <p>In a walk <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> I made ſome days paſt on the Lake to inform myſelf
in the matter of theſe pretended ruins of a Bridge, I obſerved that theſe
were two rows of Stakes which were all like one another, one row being only two
paces diſtant from the other, which beginning at the head of the Iſle where
ſtands <hi>Caeſars</hi> Tower, and from thence going up the River, reach through
the Chains, and the Iſles called <hi>Barques,</hi> drawing towards the Village of
<hi>Cologny,</hi> and reaching no farther than the end of it; ſo that theſe two
rows are in length about three thouſand paces, the Fiſhermen call them <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
Theſe Stakes are of Oak, ſquared, and about the thickneſs of a
mans thigh, and being not above two or three foot above ground, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
at the bottom of the water, the Stakes on either row are not above three
foot diſtant one from another; which makes me believe that this never
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50836:110"/>
never was a Bridge, becauſe the States are too ſmall and too near one another,
and that the Bridge thereupon would have been too narrow; moreover how
abſurd would it have been to have made a Bridge of this length, which doth
not croſs the River, but leads upwards againſt the ſtream; and beſides what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
could there be of making a Bridge to paſs from <hi>Geneva</hi> to <hi>Colog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſeeing one may go by Land thither. I ſuppoſe therefore that theſe ſtumps have
ſerved heretofore for a Ditch or Entrenchment, which had been raiſed to
make the <hi>Rhoſne</hi> paſs cleverty between the Iſle, and S. <hi>Gervais,</hi> and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the water from overflowing the low ſtreets as it has done heretofore
when the pavement was not raiſed, ſo that this Bridge which is mentioned
in <hi>Caeſars Commentaries</hi> ſtood no where elſe but in the ſame place,
where is at preſent that whereon we paſs over from the City to S. <hi>Gervais.</hi>

But it is great pity that this Epitaph is not intire, it conſiſted of four
Dyſtichs. In the firſt of which he ſeems to ſay, that he deſires not
to be judged according to his merits, but according to his faith and
truſt in Gods mercy. In the ſecond, he recommends himſelf to the
Readers prayers. In the third, he implores S. <hi>Victor</hi>'s help and the
Churches, out of which this Epitaph was taken; when that of S <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>
was pulled down to make fortifications, and in the laſt Dyſtich,
he declares his name to be <hi>Anſegiſus,</hi> and entreats again the Reader to
remember him in his prayers.</p>

THE ſtile of this Epitaph is not common. He had made it
himſelf, and had left it as a publick Teſtament to his Children.
The ſenſe of it is ſo excellent that it deſerves to be univerſally known.
He begins then thus, <q>In the name of the Almighty and moſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
God. Behold here, my Children, my laſt Will and Deſires for
you, that ye may enjoy that eaſe and plenty which I have purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
for you with a great deal of trouble, although by lawful and
honeſt means, maugre the tempeſts which have threatned me on all
ſides. And ye will live comfortably, if you ſerve God and tread in
your fathers footſteeps: otherwiſe you will not fail to meet with the
contrary. It is your Father, who hath been twice your Father who
gives you this Council, from whom although not primarily) ye
have received your being and well-being. And this hath he written
for to be an honourable teſtimony to you, if ye follow his example;
but if ye degenerate, he deſigns it for a reproach and publick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.

               <p>I Have tranſcribed this Inſcription which was made by Monſieur
<hi>Godefroy,</hi> becauſe ſome perſons have judged it to reſemble the
beauty and virtue of Antiquity. Yet we ſhall meet but with few
ſuch like affected <hi>Antitheſes,</hi> or ſporting with words, amongſt
the ancients, as <hi>munita &amp; morata, armati &amp; animati, ſecura nimis &amp; ſi
cura numinis, munimentum &amp; monumentum,</hi> although it is in the main
of it very ingenious.</p>

There are ſeveral other modern Inſcriptions which are in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Book called <hi>The Citizen,</hi> and likewiſe ſeveral particulars, and
acts which might ſerve for proofs in this Hiſtory, but we do
not think fitting to ingroſs our Book with them.</p>
